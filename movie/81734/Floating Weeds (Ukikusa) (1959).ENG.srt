What a hot day

27
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,126
Good morning

28
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,327
Terribly hot, isn't it?

29
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:45,531
What are they going to show next?

30
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:49,174
It's a Kabuki show

31
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,379
Sword-fighting plays, eh?

32
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:56,715
I liked that strip show last month

33
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:01,483
Remember that big girl in the pink?

34
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,616
This one isn't like that

35
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,353
It's the Grand Kabuki show

36
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,555
Really?

37
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,293
This troupe is coming all the way
from Okazaki,

38
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,597
through Kariya and the Chita Cape

39
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,137
Really?

40
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:20,003
You'll give me a free pass as usual?

41
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:26,643
I remember I saw this troupe years ago,
back during the war

42
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:31,177
It was at Yamada I saw this Komajuro

43
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,241
It was?

44
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,450
He played very well, too

45
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,787
He played Chuya Marubashi

46
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,089
A pint here and a quart there

47
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:43,688
Quite a lot, I'm quite aware．

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,266
Will the boat be late again?

49
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:53,466
I got no telegram from her.
She'll come on the dot

50
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,301
For a change, right?

51
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,470
Indeed

52
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:03,409
This is going to be
a really hot day today

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,127
It's overdue, eh?

54
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,264
No, not much

55
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,451
Master

56
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,727
We're here?

57
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:51,189
Kayo, you take care of that

58
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,435
Don't bother

59
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,994
Is this yours, Sugiyama?

60
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:09,072
Don't leave anything

61
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:11,283
Ready, Roku?

62
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,577
You too, Sensho?

63
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:16,214
Don't forget anything

64
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,249
Don't forget me, dear

65
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:24,128
Till from me you hear

KOMAJUROARASHIANDHIS TROUPE

68
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:44,270
- Give me one.
- Give me one

69
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,930
More, stingy

70
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,771
Say, you have a pretty sister?

71
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,038
- Nope.
- I have

72
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,373
- How old is she?
- Twelve

73
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,556
Good afternoon

74
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:20,901
Put this on the wall, sir

75
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,544
Aioi Theater, eh?

76
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,170
Do come to see us

77
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,145
Just a minute

78
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:29,273
Do you perform tonight?

79
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,683
Yes, we do

80
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,332
Hello, there

81
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,830
I'll come tonight

82
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,374
I'll be expecting you

83
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,860
Master, your wife's here

84
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,797
Good business, eh?

85
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,997
Can I have a match?

86
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,607
Tell me

87
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,511
What's your name?

88
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,806
Toshiro

89
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:38,579
Toshiro?

90
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,249
Mifune

91
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,848
You're kidding

92
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,155
You're kidding me

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,628
Another sake, Master

94
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,331
Good afternoon

95
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,908
I'll be expecting you

96
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,972
Let's go together, Okatsu.

97
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,075
Who'll take care of the customers?

98
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,284
Do come tonight

99
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:23,122
Bye.
- Bye

100
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,059
I'll be seeing you

101
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:37,600
He'd be fun

102
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:47,983
He's an Osaka actor, then?

103
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:51,650
And an old-timer around here

104
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,359
He once played in our town, too

105
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:59,793
They say he used to play at the big
theaters in Osaka

106
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,494
Is that so?

107
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:02,763
That means —

108
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:05,236
Don't move or you'll get cut

109
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:06,432
Oh, I'm afraid

110
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,738
Don't you cut me, Aiko

111
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:20,813
What a hot day

112
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,220
It's terrible

113
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,528
Your daughter? Very pretty

114
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:32,225
Hello. Helping your dad?

115
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,829
Nice of you. Admirable

116
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,600
You can rest assured, eh?

117
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:48,073
Aiko Ogawa, eh?

118
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:49,939
Cute name

119
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:51,211
Listen, Aiko

120
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:53,583
You're the only child?

121
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,878
Apple of his eye, eh?

122
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:57,924
Great help to your dad

123
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,721
Marrying a barber, too?

124
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,785
Marry someone who's good-looking

125
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:06,128
Like me. Nice and kind

126
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:12,037
What a cute little thing you are

127
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,131
Very lovely

128
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,541
Bring me a cup of tea

129
00:13:08,295 --> 00:13:09,284
We're back

130
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,297
You must be tired

131
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:23,405
We're back

132
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,745
Hello. You must be tired

133
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:33,513
It's hot. It's terribly hot

134
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,813
Bring me my kimono, will you?

135
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,356
Why?

136
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,894
Have to visit a patron

137
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,768
Good afternoon, sir

138
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:58,675
I brought this for you

139
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:01,715
Oh, thank you very much

140
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,491
The owner's here, Master

141
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,560
Thanks for everything, sir

142
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:28,339
It's been a long time

143
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:31,334
Yes, it has, indeed

144
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,178
It feels good to be back here again

145
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:37,807
When was the last time?

146
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:41,377
It was just after the surrender?

147
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:42,979
It was

148
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:46,116
It's already been twelve years
since then

149
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,593
So long, eh?

150
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,154
Time flies

151
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:54,325
I see several new faces

152
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:58,838
With the change of the times,
you know

153
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,305
My leading lady, Sumiko, sir

154
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,970
I'm pleased to meet you

155
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:12,147
What happened to that man
who played Yasu?

156
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,550
You mean Tatsunosuke

157
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:17,021
He died at Fukuchiyama

158
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,716
What happened?

159
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,590
A stroke

160
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:24,495
Such a good actor

161
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,760
I'm so sorry

162
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:31,129
And this is his daughter
who was just a child then

163
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:37,468
Grown up into a fine young lady

164
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:40,672
She used to be little as
a Chinese nut

165
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,714
What's a Chinese nut?

166
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:49,312
Like a peanut

167
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:56,021
Leaving, Manager Kimura?

168
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:01,329
I'm leaving now. Need anything?

169
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,097
Do your best

170
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,571
Flat rate, like you said?

171
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,631
That'd suit me fine

172
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,574
Next engagement?

173
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:12,111
Yes. Shingu, in Kii

174
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:14,410
Is that so?

175
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,113
I'll leave then

176
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,187
From Mr. Marudai's, Master

177
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,628
In celebration,

178
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,327
a show of hands

179
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:38,833
Once again

180
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,268
Once again

181
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:44,968
Congratulations

182
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,805
Is that the leading man?

183
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,405
He's pretty old

184
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:45,804
Give me some sake

185
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,570
- I'll leave the money here.
- Thank you

186
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,785
I knew you'd come.
I saw the parade

187
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:02,913
How've you been?
Alright?

188
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:06,924
Come right in.
It's much cooler in there

189
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:09,224
Really? Thanks very much

190
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:22,698
I'm glad to see you so well

191
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,243
You, too

192
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:26,812
It's been 12 years

193
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,677
Must've been hard.

194
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:33,981
So many years

195
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:39,155
You had sore shoulders last time

196
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,955
Alright now?

197
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,722
I did?

198
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,996
You told me the pains were killing you

199
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,134
Did I?

200
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:52,034
It's okay now

201
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,431
It's very cool here

202
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,658
Sorry to bother you

203
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,825
How's Kiyoshi? Alright?

204
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,458
Finished school last year

205
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,561
You wrote me that

206
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:26,663
Did I?

207
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,298
He's working now

208
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,865
Where?

209
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:32,844
Post office. He's saving up

210
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:35,811
Wants to study electronics
at the trade school

211
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,611
Fine

212
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:40,585
But then I'll be all alone here

213
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,986
And you'll be lonely, yes

214
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,355
But he's saving up for schooling

215
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,728
I hate to discourage him

216
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,505
Tell me

217
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,706
What does he know?

218
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,070
I mean, about me

219
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,811
He thinks his father's dead?

220
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,917
And that I'm just your brother?

221
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,415
Pretty flowers

222
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,390
Don't you feel sort of lonely?

223
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:55,361
- What do you mean?
- About Kiyoshi

224
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,828
Can't help it

225
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:00,366
I'm not worth much

226
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,662
However —

227
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:07,239
Let's not talk about it

228
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:10,909
- But —
- Forget it

229
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:13,036
Let it stay this way

230
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,585
I'm sorry for you though

231
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,351
Forget it

232
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,650
Have a drink

233
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,496
Forget it

234
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:44,400
That's Kiyoshi

235
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:48,971
Welcome home

236
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,375
Oh, hello Uncle

237
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:57,751
I should've come home sooner

238
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:01,057
Working?

239
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,527
Studying with the postmaster

240
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:05,531
How you've grown up!

241
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,568
They'd have drafted you back then

242
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:11,666
A first-grade conscript, no doubt

243
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,306
He sure has grown up

244
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,546
No wonder we're getting old

245
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:33,349
It's years since we last met

246
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:37,459
How long are you staying?

247
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,658
As long as my show draws.
A year, maybe

248
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,497
It can't last that long

249
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:45,198
It will too!

250
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,701
You made this?

251
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:51,532
What's this?

252
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:53,340
Don't tamper with it

253
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,280
I'll go see your show.
What do you play?

254
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:59,785
Forget it.
It's not meant for you

255
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,684
Who is it for?

256
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,887
An audience

257
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,391
I'm an audience

258
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,790
I know

259
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:10,557
It's nothing high-class.
Forget about it

260
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:14,727
Why show such plays?
Show something better

261
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,530
But I can't

262
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,627
Why?

263
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:21,606
Audiences today
won't understand good plays

264
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:24,473
So you can't come to see it

265
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,672
Last time we went fishing together

266
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:32,647
What fish are biting now?
- I'm not sure

267
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:34,413
Let's go together again

268
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:35,476
It's hot outside

269
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:38,490
I don't mind. Let's, shall we?

270
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:40,924
How about tomorrow? Sunday

271
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:43,155
- Sure.
- Let's

272
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,560
All right. It's a plan

273
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,334
He sure has grown up

274
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,070
Sake's warm enough?

275
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:08,484
Very logical.
He argued me down

276
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:11,148
Really? What did you argue about?

277
00:24:12,726 --> 00:24:14,819
Very wise

278
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:16,689
Very brainy

279
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:37,072
Welcome!

280
00:24:41,187 --> 00:24:42,677
Welcome!

281
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,923
Welcome! Two guests

282
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:05,975
Well, Master

283
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:11,181
This is our last night at Mt. Akagi

284
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:16,284
I am leaving my home village
of Kunisada

285
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:19,524
My true territory

286
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:25,758
I must leave you, too,
my loyal men

287
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:31,970
This is the last of the Kunisada Group

288
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:34,199
Come to think of it,

289
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:37,874
the breeze sounds lonely

290
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:45,041
A flock of geese
flying to the south

291
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:52,689
The moon is setting
behind the far hills

292
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:56,520
Where shall we go now?

293
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,994
Wherever our legs will carry us,

294
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,270
roaming aimlessly
to the end of the world

295
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,602
Master

296
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:14,442
That is Brother Enzo

297
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:18,483
Stout-hearted as he is,

298
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:24,315
he must feel lonesome
at leaving home

299
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:48,909
You, noted sword,

300
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:56,013
thoroughly tempered by the famous
Yoshikane of Kaga,

301
00:26:57,023 --> 00:27:02,984
cleansed in the brook
from the perpetual snow

302
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:12,561
You, at least, will guard me well

303
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:18,976
Though all the world betrays me,
you'll be with me, faithful one

304
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,652
The geese have flown

305
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:41,324
The crow must now lament for me

306
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:11,192
Hey, look at that

307
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,760
The barber's daughter

308
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,323
Which one?

309
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,904
See an old woman
with the towel on her head?

310
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:22,271
Behind her. Eating a bun

311
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,416
What a big mouth she has

312
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:38,787
Which one is yours?

313
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,757
She's out there

314
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:43,159
That one

315
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,697
The one who's smoking now

316
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:54,869
She's nice

317
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,875
A real find

318
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:57,965
And mine?

319
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:01,210
Your girl isn't there

320
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,873
She's cute, too

321
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,917
Not to my taste, though

322
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:08,511
Really? I'm looking forward to her

323
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:28,102
They liked it, eh?

324
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:30,035
Big house?

325
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,741
Not very

326
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,842
For an opening

327
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,017
It'll get better, I'm sure

328
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,044
Think so?

329
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:45,648
I think so.
Remember the last place?

330
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,658
Why so pessimistic these days?

331
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:49,990
Don't you worry

332
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,530
And mark my words

333
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,328
I'm positive

334
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:32,732
Where do you go after that act?

335
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,299
Climb down the mountain

336
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,003
After climbing down

337
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:40,171
It's clear

338
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:41,975
Come straight to you

339
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,141
No kidding

340
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,811
No kidding at all

341
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:50,350
Here he comes

342
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,383
Welcome

343
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:57,952
- Afternoon.
- Over here

344
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:05,266
It's hot, eh?

345
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,100
So sticky

346
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:10,033
Where's my girl?

347
00:31:10,143 --> 00:31:12,839
Don't worry. She'll come

348
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,710
See the Master?

349
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:17,172
He stepped out

350
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:23,920
Hurry, Yae.
Your man's here.

351
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:36,523
Hello there. Welcome

352
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:40,498
This her?

353
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:41,631
Just your type

354
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,607
This is no joke

355
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:46,736
No good, then?

356
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:47,802
Look here —-

357
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,905
What are you talking about?

358
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:52,007
Look at me

359
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,143
I'm freezing to death

360
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,347
Have a drink, then

361
00:31:57,657 --> 00:32:00,820
You're really reliable, Kichi

362
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:02,485
Nice man

363
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:04,029
How?

364
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,296
Just look at me

365
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,959
It's pretty sad

366
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,162
Why so sad?

367
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:14,263
Don't talk to me.
My mother's dead

368
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,575
I'm freezing to death

369
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,942
Get yourself warmed up

370
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,604
Already started?

371
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,145
Hi. Come in

372
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,481
What's your name?

373
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,352
Katsuko

374
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:33,425
Cute name

375
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,190
A real find, Senta.
Have a good time.

376
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:39,128
I'll be seeing you

377
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,961
So long

378
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:43,431
Come again

379
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,236
Senta

380
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,002
Hey, Senta

381
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:51,873
Is something wrong?

382
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,442
Though all the world betrays me!

383
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,485
I want some sake!
Hurry up

384
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:02,851
Oh, you big, beautiful man

385
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:05,618
More sake, Master

386
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:18,126
Afternoon

387
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:20,565
Where's your dad?

388
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,900
He's out now

389
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:24,374
Out? It's hot, eh?

390
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:30,105
You came to see him?

391
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,013
Well, not exactly

392
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:34,177
I came to see you

393
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:36,983
Fresh

394
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:39,347
I'm serious

395
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:43,156
Just feel how my heart is thumping

396
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,720
Mama!

397
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,092
What is it?

398
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:56,866
What happened?

399
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,107
What you want?

400
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:01,339
I wonder if I could have a shave

401
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,939
Aiko, go inside

402
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:16,756
I'm afraid I haven't much beard yet

403
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:19,229
I may not need a shave

404
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:21,360
I think not

405
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:23,658
Sit down

406
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,760
Thank you

407
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:10,609
They're not biting at all, Uncle

408
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:15,779
Just wait. Take your time

409
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:20,783
You'll get sunstroke.
Put this on your head

410
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,051
I'm okay

411
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:25,863
I think you overdid it

412
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,067
Your acting.
You really mugged it up

413
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,831
Nonsense

414
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:34,265
It was alright

415
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:40,938
But that character has no meaning now

416
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:44,605
What's that?

417
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,618
He's unreal

418
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,744
Don't be silly

419
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:52,079
He's a man of old times

420
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:55,218
You don't understand

421
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:56,318
Old-fashioned

422
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:01,696
What are you talking about?

423
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:08,462
My audience likes my performance
whether it's old-fashioned or not

424
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,200
Is that all that matters to you?

425
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:14,909
Stop talking about acting

426
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:20,547
Look, I've lost my bait again

427
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:29,518
I heard you wanted to go to college?

428
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:36,000
Nothing's better than studying

429
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,429
But your mother'll be lonely

430
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,266
Doesn't matter

431
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,067
It does, too

432
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:44,200
Imagine how she'll feel

433
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:45,675
Think of her

434
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:49,308
She's all for it

435
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,076
It doesn't matter

436
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:53,612
Yes, it does

437
00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:57,383
Don't make her sad.
She's a good mother

438
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,115
You're so clumsy

439
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:53,268
Was the bath hot enough?

440
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:54,877
Just right

441
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:56,938
I'm through now

442
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:07,988
Put in some more water

443
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:18,403
I feel so much better

444
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,534
Master not yet back?

445
00:38:25,578 --> 00:38:26,875
Where did he go?

446
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:30,040
He went fishing

447
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:32,142
Fishing?

448
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,219
I was having a shave at the barber's

449
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,381
I saw him pass by with a young man

450
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:40,591
Young man?

451
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,251
Didn't you know?

452
00:38:42,328 --> 00:38:45,525
A mail clerk.
I saw them in the mirror

453
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:48,395
What happened to your face?

454
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,227
I got a little cut at the barber's

455
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,807
Take a bath, Kayo.
The Master's late

456
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:15,449
Eat up, folks.
Supper's ready

457
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,357
Get up, time to eat

458
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:46,022
You're back

459
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:48,220
Where've you been?

460
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:50,125
I was with the boys

461
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,423
Good catch?

462
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:56,830
Fish

463
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:01,404
Did you catch many, Kichi?

464
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,406
Lots

465
00:40:05,477 --> 00:40:08,913
And he caught a blowfish.
A great big puffer, too

466
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:09,970
A good catch

467
00:40:10,049 --> 00:40:11,914
We enjoyed it, eh?

468
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,089
Were you really together?

469
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:24,154
With the boys

470
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,561
Where did you go?

471
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,626
Fishing

472
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:33,264
Who was the young man with you?

473
00:40:34,573 --> 00:40:36,871
One of my patrons, sons

474
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:39,342
A mail clerk?

475
00:40:40,746 --> 00:40:42,304
Who told you that?

476
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,349
Never mind

477
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:46,407
I won't

478
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:48,519
Who told you?

479
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:50,919
You seem worried

480
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,516
How come? Strange

481
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:58,123
- What is?
- Guilty conscience?

482
00:40:58,197 --> 00:40:59,721
About what?

483
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:01,095
Ah, I get it

484
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,225
Jealous, eh?

485
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:07,028
Save it, silly.
Save it

486
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:12,170
Why should I run around
when I have you?

487
00:41:12,244 --> 00:41:13,836
I'm an old man, silly

488
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:16,107
I'm not young anymore

489
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:19,014
You know me. Don't you?

490
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,717
I certainly do

491
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:50,707
You must know something

492
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,211
Why don't you tell me?

493
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:01,850
I won't tell

494
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:04,092
Not anyone

495
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:06,131
What do you know?

496
00:42:06,532 --> 00:42:07,999
Speak up

497
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:14,605
Look out, Masa!

498
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:27,477
You've known the Master for years

499
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:30,778
You ought to know

500
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,857
You've come here with him
long before my time

501
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,953
So tell me.
I'm begging you. Please

502
00:42:39,698 --> 00:42:41,427
Can't help it

503
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:43,933
Can't help what?

504
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,575
What can't be helped?

505
00:42:50,642 --> 00:42:52,405
And why?

506
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:59,141
He's bound to go see
his old girlfriend

507
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:02,613
Really?

508
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,218
As I thought

509
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:10,054
Who is she?

510
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:11,421
What is she?

511
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,431
What kind of person?

512
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:18,800
What does she look like?

513
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:23,100
Better ask Rokusaburo

514
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,940
He knows her, too?

515
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:27,876
I see

516
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,410
Roku knows about it, too, eh?

517
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:24,823
How can you stand this, Master?

518
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,866
Such a small house

519
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:33,466
Why did we have to come here?

520
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,823
What is it, Roku?

521
00:45:57,896 --> 00:45:59,659
She's out there

522
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:14,267
Where?

523
00:46:14,346 --> 00:46:16,246
That one

524
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,512
In front of that pillar back there

525
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:21,245
With a fan

526
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:45,106
Thanks, Roku

527
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,804
I'll buy you a drink

528
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:04,019
It's insulting

529
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:05,529
What's up?

530
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,957
It's awful

531
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:12,603
What are you grumbling about?

532
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:16,901
You can't help a small house
when it's small

533
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:24,278
Rain?

534
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,507
Is that rain?

535
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:32,786
Yes, it's begun to rain, Master

536
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:36,487
Well, bad luck never comes alone

537
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:39,894
Swift is heaven's vengeance

538
00:47:39,965 --> 00:47:44,231
What are you talking about?
Stop complaining

539
00:47:44,302 --> 00:47:46,031
You're boring

540
00:47:46,104 --> 00:47:48,231
I've had enough headaches already

541
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:53,208
Serves you right.
I knew this would happen

542
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,839
Behave yourself!

543
00:48:52,003 --> 00:48:53,903
Wait a minute

544
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,234
Again?

545
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,140
Let me see

546
00:49:03,014 --> 00:49:04,504
Are you sure?

547
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,509
Check

548
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:11,749
Wait. Wait

549
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,257
Just a second

550
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,623
Whoa, whoa

551
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:21,354
The horns of a dilemma

552
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,559
Suppose I dodge

553
00:49:23,635 --> 00:49:25,159
You'll come…

554
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:27,432
No good, either

555
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:38,376
Hurry up, will you?

556
00:49:38,483 --> 00:49:39,916
Wait, wait

557
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,419
Hurry up

558
00:49:43,955 --> 00:49:47,254
Hold your hand.
I'll withdraw

559
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:48,951
There

560
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,284
Good afternoon

561
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,652
Give me some sake

562
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:26,157
Tell me

563
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,531
Is Master Komajuro here?

564
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:37,871
Yes, he is

565
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:40,170
I would like to see him

566
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,751
You have a visitor

567
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,795
Who could it be?

568
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:06,126
You wait.
I'll get you this time

569
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:08,570
I don't mind letting you win

570
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:16,170
I was just pleasing you

571
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:18,908
Don't monkey with the men

572
00:51:28,226 --> 00:51:31,059
What do you want?

573
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:36,060
What is it?

574
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,427
I can't come here?

575
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:41,596
What?

576
00:51:41,673 --> 00:51:46,701
So the lady here
was your important patron?

577
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:54,178
Where are you going?

578
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:57,551
I must thank your patron

579
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:03,193
Don't try to stop me

580
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:09,531
I must thank you
for all your attentions to him

581
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:11,728
Thanks so very much

582
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:16,806
Don't pretend not to know

583
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,310
Go away!

584
00:52:20,945 --> 00:52:22,310
Get going

585
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,278
You!

586
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,909
Are you her son?

587
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:34,457
Who's your father?

588
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,788
What is he?

589
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:38,419
Why get so upset?

590
00:52:38,496 --> 00:52:42,227
A nice son you have

591
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:45,259
I have to tell them something

592
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:48,032
Let me go! Let go!

593
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:36,384
You fool! You prize fool!

594
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:38,820
Be sensible, you fool!

595
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,755
Who's not sensible?

596
00:53:41,526 --> 00:53:43,653
How dare you interfere?

597
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:44,922
Stop meddling

598
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:57,465
You have no say in this matter!

599
00:53:57,642 --> 00:54:01,169
What's wrong with seeing my son?

600
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:03,271
My own son, mind you

601
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:05,179
Any objections?

602
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,480
Speak up if you have any!

603
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:11,655
You certainly can dish it out,
can't you?

604
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:14,022
Shut up

605
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:16,253
How dare you?

606
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:17,919
Ingrate

607
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:19,190
What?

608
00:54:19,264 --> 00:54:21,391
Forget about Okaya?

609
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,764
Who got you out of that hole?

610
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:25,496
And at Toyokawa, too!

611
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,801
Each time you got stranded

612
00:54:30,408 --> 00:54:33,206
Where would you be without me?

613
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:38,412
Each time I had to appeal
to the impresario on all fours!

614
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,383
Remember that!

615
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,920
You ungrateful brute!

616
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:45,421
What?

617
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,048
Shut up

618
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,956
Who are you?

619
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:50,824
Remember what you were!

620
00:54:50,895 --> 00:54:53,090
You were a common whore!

621
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,361
You came up to me begging!

622
00:54:56,434 --> 00:55:00,200
I turned you into an actress, remember

623
00:55:04,475 --> 00:55:09,003
You ungrateful wretch —-
lower than an animal

624
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,345
You prize idiot, you

625
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:18,378
I can get along all by myself
without any help from you

626
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,688
Don't make me laugh, idiot

627
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:23,158
Idiot, you say?

628
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:25,628
You took the word out of my mouth!

629
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,561
How dare you?

630
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,532
I'll talk. So what?

631
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:31,532
Alright!

632
00:55:31,603 --> 00:55:34,003
I'm through with you!

633
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:36,632
I forbid you from that house!

634
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,644
My son is different from you,
mind you

635
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,479
He belongs to a higher class

636
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,315
Don't forget that, you fool!

637
00:56:38,503 --> 00:56:41,336
What's the matter?
It's all but empty

638
00:56:42,473 --> 00:56:44,941
We're miserable failures

639
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:47,068
We'll all be stranded

640
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,542
Lord Buddha help us

641
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:03,718
Listen, Kayo

642
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,558
I want you to do me a favor

643
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:13,165
A young man is working
at the post office here

644
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:16,473
A good-looking boy named Kiyoshi

645
00:57:16,574 --> 00:57:19,304
Yes? And what about him?

646
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,105
Here

647
00:57:27,118 --> 00:57:28,107
What's this?

648
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:29,619
Keep it

649
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:34,013
How come?

650
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:36,583
Just see this boy

651
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,185
Lead him on a bit

652
00:57:38,863 --> 00:57:39,852
Lead?

653
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,997
He'll fall for you, I'm sure

654
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:44,398
Do that for me

655
00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:47,469
I'm sorry. I can't

656
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,905
I'm being serious, Kayo

657
00:57:50,975 --> 00:57:53,944
But I don't even know him

658
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:56,903
Very well

659
00:57:57,448 --> 00:57:58,915
Alright

660
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:00,644
If you feel that way

661
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,445
Forget it

662
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,485
I don't know that I could do it

663
00:58:12,597 --> 00:58:14,428
You could

664
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,963
I know you could

665
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:21,995
I have yet to see a man
who wouldn't say yes to you

666
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,100
You really think I could?

667
00:58:25,176 --> 00:58:26,268
I might not

668
00:58:26,344 --> 00:58:28,403
You can

669
00:58:30,114 --> 00:58:32,105
Tell me. Why?

670
00:58:32,183 --> 00:58:34,151
Just try

671
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:36,685
To see how good you are

672
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:38,821
Keep the money

673
00:58:42,693 --> 00:58:44,718
Alright. Thanks

674
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,820
Tomorrow, then

675
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,299
Alright. I'll try then

676
00:59:32,844 --> 00:59:34,334
A telegraph blank, please

677
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:44,754
And a pencil.
- Here's a pen

678
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:46,619
I can't write with a pen

679
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:48,181
Please

680
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:57,557
I saw you on the stage

681
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:59,559
You did?

682
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:02,229
Your name is Kiyoshi, isn't it?

683
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,530
How did you know?

684
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:08,244
A little bird told me

685
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,014
Here. Send it

686
01:00:13,217 --> 01:00:15,412
Come outside to see we．

687
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,046
No. Come outside to see me

688
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:20,087
Who to?

689
01:00:21,225 --> 01:00:22,715
To you

690
01:00:33,237 --> 01:00:34,727
I'll be right back

691
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:58,490
Come to the theater
after the show tonight

692
01:00:59,163 --> 01:01:01,063
I'll be expecting you

693
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,629
I'll be right back

694
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:17,663
Where you going?

695
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:20,210
To the post office

696
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:37,387
Some noodles, please

697
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:59,499
I'm glad you came

698
01:04:00,544 --> 01:04:02,375
I thought you wouldn't come

699
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,641
You're trembling, aren't you?

700
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,116
Me, too

701
01:04:15,192 --> 01:04:16,682
See?

702
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:29,826
The sky's so blue, it's sad

703
01:05:31,669 --> 01:05:33,364
Don't be silly

704
01:05:33,437 --> 01:05:35,428
I want to eat a big cutlet

705
01:05:44,515 --> 01:05:47,382
I'm really hungry

706
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:53,083
Oh, for some shrimp
and a bottle of cold beer

707
01:05:55,259 --> 01:05:58,422
With an electric fan turning

708
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,021
Other people are eating right now

709
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:08,131
That girl at Handa, remember?
She wrote me a letter

710
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:09,695
I got one, too

711
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:14,433
The one with the mole?

712
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,002
I got one myself

713
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,016
So we're sharing something, eh?

714
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:21,574
Oh, no

715
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:27,286
I saw the barber's daughter

716
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:31,289
Stop it, will you?
She's no good

717
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,852
No good

718
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:36,363
By the way'
why is the Master never here?

719
01:06:38,102 --> 01:06:41,367
Where does he go every day?

720
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:43,736
I see him stepping out every day

721
01:06:44,675 --> 01:06:48,076
I don't know.
No wonder Miss Sumiko's worried.

722
01:06:48,145 --> 01:06:50,340
What became of the manager?

723
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:52,405
No news from him yet

724
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:54,144
No news is bad news

725
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,879
No good

726
01:06:58,522 --> 01:07:00,820
Maybe he's run away

727
01:07:01,592 --> 01:07:04,561
Or else he'd be back by now

728
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:09,293
What if he doesn't come back?

729
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:11,698
We'll be stranded again

730
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:21,876
Look at that plane

731
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:25,404
Come over here
and drop us some cold beer

732
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:19,702
Can we go on seeing each other
every day like this?

733
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,204
What about your work?

734
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:29,645
I'm on a leave of absence

735
01:08:29,713 --> 01:08:30,873
And you?

736
01:08:31,815 --> 01:08:34,477
The show's over.
No more performances

737
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:37,312
Why did it flop like that?

738
01:08:44,395 --> 01:08:46,920
We'll have to part for good soon

739
01:08:50,634 --> 01:08:54,866
What'll we be doing
around this time next year?

740
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,069
Stop talking like that

741
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:02,745
You'll be married, I think

742
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:04,542
Of course not

743
01:09:04,615 --> 01:09:06,344
Why?

744
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:08,544
What about you?

745
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:10,610
What do you think?

746
01:09:11,922 --> 01:09:13,913
Please. Don't

747
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,182
Why?

748
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,595
Nobody's looking at us

749
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:22,359
- You mustn't.
- But why?

750
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,966
I'm not really a good girl

751
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,199
Not good enough for you

752
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,071
Don't be silly

753
01:09:33,677 --> 01:09:35,167
At first

754
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,874
I was just leading you on

755
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:41,281
I didn't know anything about you

756
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:44,946
Miss Sumiko asked me to

757
01:09:45,022 --> 01:09:48,981
I was supposed to
make you fall for me

758
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:52,119
Doesn't matter how it began

759
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:54,130
Doesn't matter at all

760
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:56,598
So, how about us?

761
01:09:58,335 --> 01:09:59,427
Please

762
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:01,300
No

763
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,861
You mustn't

764
01:10:03,841 --> 01:10:06,332
You mustn't like me

765
01:11:07,738 --> 01:11:10,571
What's become of the manager?

766
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:12,731
This is terrible

767
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:19,606
We mustn't take advantage of
the impresario's kindness

768
01:11:21,118 --> 01:11:22,676
It's awful

769
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,312
Indeed

770
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:30,391
It's good when it's good

771
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,826
But when we get stranded —-

772
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:34,887
It's a terrible profession

773
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,823
Isn't Kiyoshi late?

774
01:11:49,112 --> 01:11:52,104
Why is he so late
coming home like this?

775
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,546
Must be with the postmaster

776
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,781
He's been late a couple of nights

777
01:11:59,723 --> 01:12:01,816
Can't help it, then

778
01:12:01,892 --> 01:12:04,258
I'll have to go away soon

779
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:07,161
So I want to see him while I can

780
01:12:08,298 --> 01:12:10,232
What a mess

781
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:18,401
You'll be lonely again

782
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:20,375
Is the next place Shingu?

783
01:12:20,444 --> 01:12:22,708
According to the schedule, yes

784
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:24,542
I'm not sure now

785
01:12:24,615 --> 01:12:27,379
I've always wanted to
visit Shingu again

786
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:33,783
But no relative of yours
lives there now, I think

787
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:40,959
Even the Tsukinoya Inn
is run by someone else now, I hear

788
01:12:43,133 --> 01:12:45,795
Everything changes

789
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,236
It's the way of the world

790
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:58,079
Tell me.
Who was that woman?

791
01:12:58,148 --> 01:12:59,638
Who?

792
01:12:59,716 --> 01:13:01,843
That woman who came here

793
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,717
Oh, that one.
She's no good

794
01:13:04,788 --> 01:13:07,120
Forgive me

795
01:13:09,893 --> 01:13:11,485
My mistake

796
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:14,655
I should have known much better.
But by mere chance —-

797
01:13:15,732 --> 01:13:18,257
- Oh, you.
- What is it?

798
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,462
You think I'm jealous?

799
01:13:20,537 --> 01:13:22,767
I know better than that

800
01:13:22,839 --> 01:13:25,034
I know you're a fast worker

801
01:13:25,108 --> 01:13:27,201
Really?

802
01:13:28,545 --> 01:13:30,035
Forgive me

803
01:13:31,848 --> 01:13:36,842
But don't you think
she might tell Kiyoshi?

804
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,185
- Tell him what?
- That you're his father

805
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:42,555
I don't think so

806
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:45,151
She won't come here again

807
01:13:45,228 --> 01:13:47,128
But she might see him

808
01:13:47,197 --> 01:13:49,893
That would be terrible, yes

809
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,527
But I don't think she will

810
01:14:00,744 --> 01:14:05,579
So, he's to go on thinking
you're his uncle?

811
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,549
That's right

812
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:09,380
He mustn't know,

813
01:14:09,453 --> 01:14:11,318
or he'd be unhappy

814
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:13,015
But —-

815
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,819
Forget it

816
01:14:15,525 --> 01:14:17,959
I'll remain his uncle for life

817
01:16:00,697 --> 01:16:02,688
Wait a minute

818
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:10,296
Where've you been?

819
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:14,934
Come here

820
01:16:23,653 --> 01:16:25,143
Come

821
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:48,403
Who were you seeing?

822
01:16:49,412 --> 01:16:50,572
Who was he?

823
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:51,807
Speak up!

824
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,617
When did you see him first?

825
01:16:57,454 --> 01:16:59,718
Speak up

826
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,620
Are you deaf?

827
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:11,695
Never mind who I was seeing.
Leave me alone

828
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:13,702
What?

829
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,261
What are you trying to do to him?

830
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:18,500
Seduce him?

831
01:17:20,076 --> 01:17:22,101
You think so, Master?

832
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,875
Yes, I think so

833
01:17:24,948 --> 01:17:28,406
I know what a slut like you
would try

834
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:30,476
Any excuses?

835
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:33,218
Speak up

836
01:17:41,431 --> 01:17:43,023
It's only natural

837
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,429
that you should think this

838
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:51,738
Even Miss Sumiko at first —-

839
01:17:51,808 --> 01:17:53,639
She paid me to try

840
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,575
What?

841
01:17:55,645 --> 01:17:59,103
What did she want you to do?

842
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:03,477
Tell me what she told you to do?

843
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:06,283
Forget it.
Doesn't matter now

844
01:18:06,356 --> 01:18:08,551
Speak up! Or else —-

845
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,187
Or I'll break your arm!

846
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:17,990
She asked me if I'd seduce
that young man

847
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,332
Sumiko asked you to do that?

848
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:21,893
She did?

849
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:23,371
You mean it?

850
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,169
Are you sure?

851
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,766
Is it true?

852
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:29,067
Alright

853
01:18:29,813 --> 01:18:32,748
Bring her here at once

854
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:37,577
Hurry

855
01:18:38,521 --> 01:18:40,011
Bring her here

856
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,855
Right away

857
01:19:41,117 --> 01:19:42,982
You wanted me?

858
01:19:43,053 --> 01:19:44,714
Come over here

859
01:19:50,794 --> 01:19:52,352
What is it?

860
01:19:53,596 --> 01:19:55,325
What do you want?

861
01:19:56,099 --> 01:19:58,033
You slut

862
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:00,968
You wanted to ruin my son?

863
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:03,369
I told you to lay off, didn't I?

864
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:07,840
I did nothing

865
01:20:08,912 --> 01:20:10,504
A great boy he is,

866
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,912
with an actress for a mistress

867
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:16,748
Don't say that

868
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:20,854
Like father, like son

869
01:20:39,776 --> 01:20:41,471
Angry?

870
01:20:41,544 --> 01:20:43,876
Serves you right!

871
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,447
Life's a lottery

872
01:20:49,519 --> 01:20:51,885
You can't always be lucky

873
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:54,287
I want you to remember that

874
01:20:54,357 --> 01:20:55,688
What?

875
01:20:55,759 --> 01:20:57,522
Remember yourself

876
01:20:57,594 --> 01:20:59,084
You slut

877
01:20:59,162 --> 01:21:01,528
You prize fool

878
01:21:01,598 --> 01:21:03,725
I never want to see you again

879
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,860
Go away

880
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:12,936
Wait a second

881
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:15,068
What? Let go

882
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:22,182
Do you hate me that much?

883
01:21:25,288 --> 01:21:28,587
Don't you see why I had to do this?

884
01:21:29,325 --> 01:21:32,192
You kept that woman from me

885
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,127
Think how I felt

886
01:21:34,998 --> 01:21:37,159
Now we're even

887
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:41,429
Let's let bygones be bygones

888
01:21:41,504 --> 01:21:44,439
See what I mean?
Let's be friends again

889
01:21:44,507 --> 01:21:46,270
We're stranded

890
01:21:46,342 --> 01:21:48,139
Let's not quarrel now

891
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:50,034
Shut up

892
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:51,410
Nothing doing

893
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:53,278
After all you did,

894
01:21:53,349 --> 01:21:54,873
I'm through with you

895
01:22:27,584 --> 01:22:29,074
Idiot!

896
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:22,200
Why so quiet tonight?
What is it?

897
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:26,472
It's awful

898
01:23:28,011 --> 01:23:30,138
Pull yourselves together

899
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:35,549
- Give me another drink.
- Have any money?

900
01:23:35,618 --> 01:23:37,950
No worry. Right?

901
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,921
Have any?

902
01:23:43,092 --> 01:23:44,423
What?

903
01:23:44,494 --> 01:23:45,893
Money

904
01:23:45,962 --> 01:23:48,260
You know I haven't any

905
01:23:48,331 --> 01:23:52,097
Don't make me laugh

906
01:23:58,207 --> 01:23:59,697
Stop it

907
01:23:59,776 --> 01:24:02,609
Don't paw me like that,
you awful man

908
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:04,669
Me?

909
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:10,649
I'm doing nothing at all

910
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,950
What are you talking about?

911
01:24:13,957 --> 01:24:15,288
Awful

912
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:17,920
Let's get out of here

913
01:24:18,795 --> 01:24:21,457
Where are our drinks?

914
01:24:21,531 --> 01:24:24,125
No money, no drinks

915
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,406
Listen

916
01:24:31,474 --> 01:24:35,035
Why is the Master
hanging on like this?

917
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:39,275
That manager's
never going to come back

918
01:24:40,249 --> 01:24:44,345
I know.
That's why I've been thinking

919
01:24:45,355 --> 01:24:46,720
About what?

920
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:50,153
Nothing

921
01:24:50,226 --> 01:24:53,320
What's on your mind?
Tell me

922
01:24:58,034 --> 01:25:00,730
Have you ever done that before?

923
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:03,670
Yes, once.
With the Omi Company

924
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:05,207
I see

925
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:07,799
Me, too.
And you?

926
01:25:09,045 --> 01:25:12,014
- What?
- Not so loud

927
01:25:13,049 --> 01:25:15,950
Let's leave before it's too late

928
01:25:16,019 --> 01:25:19,420
We can use the Master's money

929
01:25:20,623 --> 01:25:22,215
Not me

930
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:25,852
Listen.
Why must we be so loyal to him?

931
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:28,629
I disagree with you

932
01:25:28,698 --> 01:25:31,565
Yes, sir.
Though I won't stop you

933
01:25:33,269 --> 01:25:34,793
Not so loud, please

934
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:37,066
I have a penetrating voice

935
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,165
Though I won't tell on you

936
01:25:41,577 --> 01:25:43,977
Shall we just drop the idea?

937
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:47,539
Maybe we should

938
01:25:48,217 --> 01:25:49,844
Yes, of course

939
01:25:50,653 --> 01:25:52,883
To treat him like that

940
01:25:52,955 --> 01:25:55,446
After owing him so much

941
01:25:55,525 --> 01:26:01,259
A man who is ungrateful
is not a human being at all

942
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:04,627
You guys disgust me

943
01:26:05,134 --> 01:26:10,629
I never realized
you two were such bad guys

944
01:26:11,174 --> 01:26:13,802
Even after being together for years

945
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:15,537
Makes me mad!

946
01:26:15,611 --> 01:26:18,478
I know how you feel

947
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:21,415
It was ungrateful of us
to think of it

948
01:26:21,484 --> 01:26:25,284
Yes, I guess it was

949
01:26:25,354 --> 01:26:27,584
Naturally

950
01:26:27,657 --> 01:26:31,115
Now, Kichi,
we've changed our minds

951
01:26:31,194 --> 01:26:33,025
Let's be friends

952
01:26:33,096 --> 01:26:37,692
Drop your silly ideas
and try to act like human beings

953
01:26:37,767 --> 01:26:39,234
Very well

954
01:26:39,302 --> 01:26:40,769
I'm sorry

955
01:26:40,837 --> 01:26:42,998
Let's have a drink

956
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:46,564
Give us three drinks, will you?

957
01:26:50,146 --> 01:26:51,738
Don't worry

958
01:26:55,551 --> 01:26:59,510
Preparing for the worst,
I've laid this aside

959
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,524
So you have a nest egg, eh?

960
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,082
Is that all?

961
01:27:05,328 --> 01:27:07,728
A paper charm
against pickpockets, too

962
01:27:07,797 --> 01:27:10,163
Give us three drinks

963
01:27:10,233 --> 01:27:12,133
Here she is

964
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:21,537
Give me some sake

965
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:25,276
Make it hot

966
01:27:26,649 --> 01:27:28,844
Here's our angel

967
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:30,408
I'll keep this

968
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:31,976
Evening, Miss Sumiko

969
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,287
So, you've been here, boys

970
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:41,153
No news from the manager yet?

971
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:45,667
No, nothing

972
01:27:45,735 --> 01:27:49,899
Chances are he won't come back

973
01:27:50,773 --> 01:27:54,436
What a bad fellow he is

974
01:27:55,711 --> 01:27:58,805
Where are our drinks?

975
01:29:02,979 --> 01:29:04,742
What do you say?

976
01:29:09,118 --> 01:29:10,983
Is that all you can do?

977
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:15,251
This is the best we can do

978
01:29:15,324 --> 01:29:18,293
That's the very best, mind you

979
01:29:19,262 --> 01:29:20,752
I see

980
01:29:21,497 --> 01:29:23,829
Only that much

981
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,562
Can't help it

982
01:29:27,503 --> 01:29:30,404
Enough for our rail fares

983
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:34,633
Very well

984
01:29:46,389 --> 01:29:49,620
Was the camera all he took?

985
01:29:50,526 --> 01:29:52,016
And a lighter

986
01:29:52,094 --> 01:29:55,063
Kichi owed me lots of money

987
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:56,928
Worse for the Master

988
01:29:56,999 --> 01:29:58,591
He had his purse stolen

989
01:29:58,668 --> 01:30:00,727
What a terrible fellow

990
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:02,464
I'll kill him if I see him

991
01:30:03,306 --> 01:30:06,104
I got sort of suspicious of him

992
01:30:06,175 --> 01:30:08,700
He'd never been straight, either

993
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,268
That's right

994
01:30:10,346 --> 01:30:14,442
He even stole my charm
against pickpockets

995
01:30:14,517 --> 01:30:16,314
He stole all I had

996
01:30:16,385 --> 01:30:18,444
Terrible man!

997
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:24,917
Tell me, Sensho

998
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:29,254
What are your future plans?

999
01:30:29,832 --> 01:30:32,392
What is to become of us?

1000
01:31:27,289 --> 01:31:29,484
Your cup is empty, Yatazo.

1001
01:31:29,558 --> 01:31:31,150
Thank you, sir

1002
01:31:41,237 --> 01:31:46,766
I must ask your forgiveness
for all this

1003
01:31:47,777 --> 01:31:50,610
But every cloud has a silver lining

1004
01:31:51,514 --> 01:31:54,142
I'll tell you when I make a new start

1005
01:31:54,984 --> 01:31:58,852
I want you to join me
if you’re free

1006
01:32:00,756 --> 01:32:04,055
Where are you planning to work,
Kamenosuke?

1007
01:32:04,126 --> 01:32:09,587
My brother-in-law
is running a pickle shop at Hamamatsu

1008
01:32:09,665 --> 01:32:11,530
I see

1009
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,090
And you?

1010
01:32:13,769 --> 01:32:17,330
I think I'll go see
my former employer

1011
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:20,273
He may hire me again

1012
01:32:20,342 --> 01:32:22,207
I see

1013
01:32:22,278 --> 01:32:24,405
A bath-house owner, isn't he?

1014
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:33,210
Those who can quit the stage
had better do so

1015
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:37,418
You say you'll go to school again?

1016
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:42,155
Yes, sir.
As a working student, if possible

1017
01:32:44,366 --> 01:32:47,267
The troupe's breaking up

1018
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:51,631
But I want you
to remember me sometimes

1019
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:54,932
We've had hard times

1020
01:32:55,478 --> 01:32:59,005
But we've had good times, too

1021
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:01,739
Master

1022
01:33:01,817 --> 01:33:04,843
Let's have some fun.
This isn't a wake

1023
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,286
Good idea.
Yes, let's

1024
01:33:07,356 --> 01:33:10,018
Why don't you come here
and join us, Miss Sumiko?

1025
01:33:13,562 --> 01:33:16,053
This is a farewell party

1026
01:33:29,945 --> 01:33:32,675
- What happened to Kayo?
- I wonder

1027
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:48,160
Master

1028
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:52,428
Why can't you be nice
to Miss Sumiko?

1029
01:33:56,906 --> 01:33:58,464
Well, old Sensho,

1030
01:33:59,308 --> 01:34:01,208
and you, Roku,

1031
01:34:01,277 --> 01:34:06,772
we've been together
for a long, long time, haven't we?

1032
01:34:11,086 --> 01:34:14,180
Sensho,
he's speaking to you

1033
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:19,991
We've been through thick and thin

1034
01:34:20,062 --> 01:34:24,260
I'm afraid I was rather strict
with you sometimes

1035
01:34:25,234 --> 01:34:27,896
We've been together for many years

1036
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:31,734
Forgive me

1037
01:34:55,531 --> 01:34:57,158
Grandpa

1038
01:35:02,504 --> 01:35:06,600
What's the matter?

1039
01:35:06,675 --> 01:35:08,302
Grandpa

1040
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:35,054
We're in a mess

1041
01:36:36,031 --> 01:36:37,362
What's happened?

1042
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:41,102
We've broken up

1043
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,730
My goodness. Really?

1044
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:48,535
The impresario tried to help me out,

1045
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:50,510
but it was all in vain

1046
01:36:53,482 --> 01:36:56,007
He's been very kind to me

1047
01:36:58,087 --> 01:37:00,078
Why don't you come in?

1048
01:37:00,155 --> 01:37:02,089
Where is Kiyoshi?

1049
01:37:03,992 --> 01:37:05,516
Wasn't he with you?

1050
01:37:05,594 --> 01:37:07,755
No, he wasn't

1051
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:11,857
A young person came for him
with a message from you

1052
01:37:11,934 --> 01:37:13,458
Young person?

1053
01:37:13,535 --> 01:37:14,797
A girl

1054
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:17,561
And he went out?

1055
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:19,607
Yes. Together with her

1056
01:37:40,829 --> 01:37:43,491
What's the matter?

1057
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,061
This is terrible

1058
01:37:46,802 --> 01:37:48,167
What is it?

1059
01:37:48,871 --> 01:37:50,805
Kiyoshi

1060
01:37:50,873 --> 01:37:53,501
He's ruined, I'm afraid

1061
01:38:07,022 --> 01:38:08,512
What happened?

1062
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,421
What did he do?

1063
01:38:14,897 --> 01:38:16,865
This is terrible

1064
01:38:16,932 --> 01:38:19,025
What in the world did Kiyoshi do?

1065
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:20,659
Tell me

1066
01:39:02,845 --> 01:39:05,837
What are you thinking?

1067
01:39:09,685 --> 01:39:11,175
Are you sorry?

1068
01:39:12,221 --> 01:39:13,711
Of course not

1069
01:39:13,789 --> 01:39:15,256
I brought you here

1070
01:39:15,858 --> 01:39:18,418
- But —-
- But what?

1071
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,155
It was my fault

1072
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:23,091
We shouldn't have come

1073
01:39:23,165 --> 01:39:24,928
Why?

1074
01:39:25,968 --> 01:39:29,699
You mustn't have anything to do
with a girl like me

1075
01:39:29,771 --> 01:39:32,501
I'm not good enough for you

1076
01:39:32,574 --> 01:39:34,337
The Master must be angry

1077
01:39:35,777 --> 01:39:37,267
Why say that?

1078
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,746
Uncle has nothing to do with it

1079
01:39:39,815 --> 01:39:46,186
You told me you wanted to go to college
and study, didn't you?

1080
01:39:46,622 --> 01:39:48,453
That's good

1081
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:50,151
You do that

1082
01:39:50,225 --> 01:39:54,059
Or else you'll be sorry afterwards

1083
01:39:54,129 --> 01:39:56,461
Then you're sorry?

1084
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:59,057
I don't need to go to college

1085
01:40:06,642 --> 01:40:09,873
I'm going to take you to my mother

1086
01:40:09,945 --> 01:40:12,311
She'll consent to our plan

1087
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:15,043
If she won't, I'll —
- Please

1088
01:40:15,117 --> 01:40:16,641
Don't do that

1089
01:40:17,486 --> 01:40:19,716
Go home like a good boy

1090
01:40:19,788 --> 01:40:21,813
Go home to your mother

1091
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:23,755
Please

1092
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:25,850
What for?

1093
01:40:25,928 --> 01:40:27,418
Why?

1094
01:40:28,664 --> 01:40:30,188
We have to part

1095
01:40:30,265 --> 01:40:32,495
For good

1096
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:35,298
What'll become of you?

1097
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:37,736
The troupe's busted up

1098
01:40:37,806 --> 01:40:39,569
Forget me

1099
01:40:39,641 --> 01:40:42,007
Forget all about a girl like me

1100
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:45,012
I can get along, somehow or other

1101
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,139
Don't be silly

1102
01:40:47,215 --> 01:40:49,945
Go home, please

1103
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:54,748
Go home

1104
01:40:56,558 --> 01:40:58,219
Please

1105
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:43,697
Where did he go, anyway?

1106
01:41:51,079 --> 01:41:54,378
Like father, like son

1107
01:41:55,717 --> 01:41:57,708
Fast worker

1108
01:41:57,786 --> 01:41:59,310
I didn't know that

1109
01:42:01,723 --> 01:42:05,784
I thought he didn't take after me

1110
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:12,592
I'm afraid I was too optimistic
about the whole thing

1111
01:42:13,835 --> 01:42:16,963
Now it's come to this

1112
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:22,070
All my plans have gone to pieces

1113
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:28,145
Listen

1114
01:42:28,216 --> 01:42:30,116
You're imagining too much

1115
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:33,110
Look here

1116
01:42:33,188 --> 01:42:38,888
What can you expect
when he eloped with a girl like that?

1117
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,655
I mean it

1118
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:42,720
I'm disappointed in him

1119
01:42:46,401 --> 01:42:47,959
But —-

1120
01:42:49,237 --> 01:42:50,966
I'm sure he'll come back

1121
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,838
He's not a bad boy

1122
01:42:57,913 --> 01:42:59,403
He'll come back

1123
01:43:00,482 --> 01:43:02,074
Think so?

1124
01:43:03,018 --> 01:43:04,986
You think he'll come home?

1125
01:43:07,656 --> 01:43:09,851
What if he doesn't?

1126
01:43:14,896 --> 01:43:19,424
I know.
Yes, I know

1127
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:26,169
But young people today
are so reckless

1128
01:43:27,642 --> 01:43:29,303
He'll come back

1129
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:32,005
He's bound to come

1130
01:43:36,384 --> 01:43:38,147
Listen

1131
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,279
When he comes back,

1132
01:43:40,355 --> 01:43:43,813
why don't you settle down?

1133
01:43:44,526 --> 01:43:46,517
Tell Kiyoshi the truth

1134
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:50,622
He's old enough to understand

1135
01:43:52,334 --> 01:43:54,529
He'll find out one day

1136
01:43:56,905 --> 01:44:00,671
He's bound to find out sooner or later

1137
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:08,280
Had we told him before,
this wouldn't have happened

1138
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:11,148
Tell him everything

1139
01:44:15,357 --> 01:44:18,349
Tell him

1140
01:44:21,363 --> 01:44:23,661
And make this place my home, eh?

1141
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:26,964
I wish you would

1142
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,301
Should I?

1143
01:44:30,906 --> 01:44:34,808
You will? Thank you

1144
01:44:34,876 --> 01:44:36,639
He'll be delighted

1145
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:42,707
But —

1146
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:45,885
Where can he be now?

1147
01:44:51,226 --> 01:44:53,353
Do you want a drink?

1148
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:57,630
I'll make it hot

1149
01:45:07,042 --> 01:45:08,942
Here he is

1150
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:16,783
Where've you been?

1151
01:45:20,989 --> 01:45:22,513
Answer me

1152
01:45:24,192 --> 01:45:26,057
I want to ask you something

1153
01:45:27,095 --> 01:45:28,119
What is it?

1154
01:45:43,278 --> 01:45:44,609
Why, you!

1155
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:48,649
How can you show your face to me?

1156
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:50,275
You fool!

1157
01:45:51,286 --> 01:45:53,948
I'm sorry, Master

1158
01:45:56,091 --> 01:45:59,254
I'm the sorry one.
You slut!

1159
01:46:01,396 --> 01:46:02,886
Don't, Uncle

1160
01:46:02,964 --> 01:46:04,488
She's apologizing

1161
01:46:04,566 --> 01:46:05,726
What?

1162
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,292
How dare you
worry Mother like this?

1163
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,835
Don't do that

1164
01:46:13,775 --> 01:46:15,470
Shut up

1165
01:46:15,543 --> 01:46:18,341
They deserve this

1166
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:22,072
Whore!
- Stop, Uncle

1167
01:46:23,385 --> 01:46:26,047
Don't! Please!

1168
01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:30,154
What are you doing?

1169
01:46:40,669 --> 01:46:42,500
- Well.
- What?

1170
01:46:48,009 --> 01:46:51,877
Do you know who this is?

1171
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:53,471
He's your father —-

1172
01:46:53,548 --> 01:46:55,709
your real father

1173
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:57,615
Apologize to him

1174
01:47:00,889 --> 01:47:02,083
I see

1175
01:47:02,157 --> 01:47:03,647
Yes

1176
01:47:04,726 --> 01:47:06,455
Just as I thought

1177
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:12,456
Mother,

1178
01:47:12,534 --> 01:47:16,903
you told me my father died
when I was little

1179
01:47:19,441 --> 01:47:22,410
I believed it.
I still believe it

1180
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:25,605
I don't want a father

1181
01:47:26,414 --> 01:47:27,972
I don't need one

1182
01:47:33,254 --> 01:47:34,744
Listen

1183
01:47:34,823 --> 01:47:42,059
He didn't want you to know
that you were an itinerant actor's son

1184
01:47:42,897 --> 01:47:44,489
How come?

1185
01:47:45,233 --> 01:47:46,222
Why?

1186
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:51,238
He wanted you to study hard
and become somebody

1187
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:58,211
So he worked hard and sent me
the money for your schooling

1188
01:47:58,279 --> 01:47:59,940
That's enough

1189
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:01,505
Stop it

1190
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,174
So, Uncle…

1191
01:48:06,121 --> 01:48:08,589
why show up all of a sudden?

1192
01:48:08,656 --> 01:48:12,217
Mother.
Why tell me this now?

1193
01:48:12,293 --> 01:48:14,887
You two are selfish

1194
01:48:14,963 --> 01:48:17,022
I don't want a father

1195
01:48:17,098 --> 01:48:18,588
Go away

1196
01:48:22,637 --> 01:48:24,161
Go away

1197
01:48:25,206 --> 01:48:26,730
Get going

1198
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,721
Forgive me

1199
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:51,956
I knew nothing about it

1200
01:48:53,668 --> 01:48:56,296
I'm afraid he's right

1201
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:58,532
Very natural, too

1202
01:48:59,307 --> 01:49:05,507
You can't suddenly show up out of
nowhere and then try to be a father

1203
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:09,246
But —-

1204
01:49:09,317 --> 01:49:11,581
Why talk like this?

1205
01:49:12,554 --> 01:49:16,217
On second thought I won't settle down

1206
01:49:17,392 --> 01:49:19,155
It'll be better

1207
01:49:20,061 --> 01:49:22,120
Much better for us all

1208
01:49:22,864 --> 01:49:26,527
But Kiyoshi isn't mad at you anymore

1209
01:49:27,635 --> 01:49:29,193
You see,

1210
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:32,603
I'm going to turn over a new leaf

1211
01:49:39,981 --> 01:49:45,112
Let me leave tonight
as though I'm still his uncle

1212
01:49:49,524 --> 01:49:56,487
Next time I come back here, I'll be
a good actor he can be proud of

1213
01:49:57,198 --> 01:49:59,689
Let me look forward to such a day

1214
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,900
Yes, such a day will come

1215
01:50:05,573 --> 01:50:07,131
But you —-

1216
01:50:07,842 --> 01:50:12,074
Then we'll celebrate
my success and be happy

1217
01:50:14,682 --> 01:50:16,240
Master

1218
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,888
Take me with you

1219
01:50:21,756 --> 01:50:25,157
I'll work hard to help you

1220
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:29,159
I can't leave you like this

1221
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:31,321
Please

1222
01:50:34,335 --> 01:50:37,862
Master, I'm begging you

1223
01:50:37,939 --> 01:50:39,600
Take me with you

1224
01:50:40,742 --> 01:50:42,232
Please

1225
01:50:43,611 --> 01:50:45,943
Did you hear that?

1226
01:50:46,915 --> 01:50:49,179
Isn't that nice?

1227
01:50:54,055 --> 01:50:57,547
Be good enough to look after her
as well

1228
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,451
I'm sorry I scolded you

1229
01:51:02,497 --> 01:51:04,226
Forgive me

1230
01:51:09,804 --> 01:51:11,965
Help Kiyoshi to make good

1231
01:51:13,141 --> 01:51:14,699
I'm counting on you

1232
01:51:16,377 --> 01:51:19,244
Understand?

1233
01:51:19,314 --> 01:51:20,804
Please

1234
01:51:48,009 --> 01:51:50,944
The Master —-

1235
01:51:51,012 --> 01:51:52,502
Go see him!

1236
01:51:53,648 --> 01:51:55,513
Hurry

1237
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:56,641
See him

1238
01:51:56,718 --> 01:51:57,776
Hurry

1239
01:51:58,453 --> 01:52:00,353
Will you hurry?

1240
01:52:14,836 --> 01:52:16,326
Where's Uncle?

1241
01:52:16,404 --> 01:52:17,598
Where is he?

1242
01:52:21,209 --> 01:52:23,404
What's happened to Uncle?

1243
01:52:24,712 --> 01:52:26,509
Your father?

1244
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:32,481
He's left for the road

1245
01:52:39,627 --> 01:52:41,356
Don't stop him

1246
01:52:50,371 --> 01:52:52,032
Leave him alone

1247
01:52:53,007 --> 01:52:59,435
Each time he came to this town,
ever since you were a baby,

1248
01:52:59,514 --> 01:53:03,041
he left just like this

1249
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:08,521
It's alright

1250
01:53:10,391 --> 01:53:15,021
But only if you can really
become somebody

1251
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:36,101
Where you going, Master?

1252
01:55:47,348 --> 01:55:49,213
Give me a light

1253
01:55:58,125 --> 01:55:59,990
Tell me

1254
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:01,995
Where you going?

1255
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:12,362
I don't know where to go now

1256
01:56:14,575 --> 01:56:16,736
Do you have any plans?

1257
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:27,687
You have?

1258
01:56:27,755 --> 01:56:30,588
Tell me.
Where you going?

1259
01:56:34,662 --> 01:56:36,220
Kuwana

1260
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:39,397
Which impresario?

1261
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:45,905
Mr. Kaneyoshi may give me a chance,
I think

1262
01:56:47,775 --> 01:56:51,233
Good.
May I go with you?

1263
01:56:58,619 --> 01:57:02,487
I happen to know Mr. Kaneyoshi
very well

1264
01:57:03,224 --> 01:57:06,421
You don't want me to go with you?

1265
01:57:07,828 --> 01:57:09,557
I'm taking a chance

1266
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,400
Shall we try?

1267
01:57:14,468 --> 01:57:17,631
Yes, let's.
Good idea

1268
01:57:17,705 --> 01:57:20,868
- Shall we?
- Sure

1269
01:57:20,942 --> 01:57:24,400
Yes, let's.
Let's

1270
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:31,142
Two tickets to Kuwana

1271
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:36,121
Don't forget your things

1272
01:58:08,422 --> 01:58:09,753
Like some?
