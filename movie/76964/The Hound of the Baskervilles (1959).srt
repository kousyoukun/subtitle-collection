00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,340
"Know then the legend of
the hound of the Baskervilles.

2
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,040
"Know then that the great hall
of Baskervilles...

3
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,110
"...was once held
by Sir Hugo of that name...

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,420
"...a wild, profane, and godless man.

5
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,840
"An evil man, in truth...

6
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,680
"...for there was with him
a certain ugly and cruel humor...

7
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,520
"...that made his name a byword
in the county."

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,560
-Our friend learns swiftly.
-Aye.

9
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,360
He's already learned to
fly like a wildfowl...

10
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,030
...and now he swims like a waterfowl.

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,030
Shall we see how he roasts?

12
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,580
Fetch him.

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,240
By morning, our friend will know better
than to condemn the sport of his master.

14
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,890
Come on out. Come on.

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,270
Here he comes, Sir Hugo.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Here he is, Sir Hugo.

17
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,210
Now our waterfowl
has become guinea fowl.

18
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,350
Guinea pig, more likely.

19
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,420
Bird or beast, we'll soon make him sing
like a nightingale.

20
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,690
Now, sir...

21
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,090
This may teach you
to criticize my pleasures.

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,420
If 'twere anyone
but my own daughter, Master...

23
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,330
You should be proud that a Baskerville...

24
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,060
...should so much as look
at your miserable child.

25
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,910
Pay up!

26
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,590
No, no! The game was spoiled
before the wager was laid.

27
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,420
Do not crowd me, sirs, I pray you.

28
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,020
I will not pay.

29
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,660
What about the wager?

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,700
If I must, I must.

31
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,690
-But not in gold.
-Not in gold?

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,460
In kind,
with a plaything I was keeping for myself.

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,340
I accept. Where is the girl?

34
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,370
Girl? What talk is this of a girl?
I know of no girl.

35
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,810
Enough!

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,290
You shall see her at once,
and before Sir Richard bursts with passion.

37
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,290
See to it that there be no fighting
among your herd of rams.

38
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,580
The bitch has got away.

39
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,650
What does she think I am,
that she does this to me?

40
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,660
Damn her!

41
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,520
I have her now.

42
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,460
You there! Let loose the pack!

43
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,770
And you, my hunter at the door...

44
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,610
-...set the hounds on her.
-But, sir, you cannot...

45
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,810
The hounds! Let loose the pack!

46
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,670
-Yeah, I'll get her.
-My friend, you cannot do this.

47
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,210
I'll get her!

48
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,870
May the hounds of Hell take me
if I can't hunt her down!

49
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,120
Come on.

50
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,130
Come on, what's the matter with you?
Come on, will you?

51
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,880
Now, you witch!

52
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,090
No.

53
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,970
"And so, the curse of Sir Hugo...

54
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,070
"...came upon the Baskervilles...

55
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,610
"...in the shape of a hound from Hell...

56
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,740
"...forever to bring misfortune...

57
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,840
"...to the Baskerville family.

58
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,380
"Therefore, take heed...

59
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,860
"...and beware the moor
in those dark hours when evil is exalted...

60
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,990
"...else you will surely meet
the hound of Hell...

61
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,590
"...the hound of the Baskervilles.

62
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,300
"So ends the legend."

63
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,570
And what, may I ask,
do you think of that, Mr. Holmes?

64
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,710
There must be hundreds
of similar folk stories.

65
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,790
I fail to see why I should find this one
of singular interest.

66
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,330
What do you say, Watson?

67
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,660
I'm sure Dr. Mortimer's intentions
are for the best...

68
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,800
...but there seems little to be gained
from what he's told us.

69
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,000
I had hoped, sir,
that the facts I have laid before you...

70
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,230
...might have intrigued you as a detective.

71
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,270
I was obviously mistaken.

72
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,340
Good day to you, sir.

73
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,940
Dr. Mortimer,
it was something more important...

74
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,610
...that brought you
from Devonshire to Baker Street...

75
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,910
...something that occurred on Dartmoor
on Friday, the 13th of June.

76
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,550
You've known about it all the time, then?

77
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,920
I know nothing,
except that you live on Dartmoor...

78
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,020
...have a copy of the
Devon County Chronicle in your briefcase...

79
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,100
...dated June 14.

80
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,600
That newspaper is published on Saturdays,
but goes to press on Thursday.

81
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,030
You've kept it for something
vitally important.

82
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,500
The headlines aren't interesting,
so it must be in the stop press.

83
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,670
Whatever it was happened
on Friday, the 13th of June.

84
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,670
-But this is remarkable.
-Superficial.

85
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,140
There's nothing remarkable
about using one's eyes.

86
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,910
Now, sir, would you be prepared
to give us the relevant facts?

87
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,250
Why, yes.

88
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,750
Under the circumstances, I think I would.

89
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,350
-Proceed.
-Thank you.

90
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,850
This is just the stop press.

91
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,190
"Devonshire knight found dead.

92
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,130
"The body of Sir Charles Baskerville
discovered on Dartmoor early today.

93
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,170
"Foul play not suspected."

94
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,090
The account in the next edition is
much fuller.

95
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,690
Now, where are we?

96
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,770
Yes, here we are.

97
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,400
"The death of Sir Charles Baskerville
has caused much sadness...

98
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,840
"...in the small village
of Grimpen, Dartmoor.

99
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,810
"Dr. Richard Mortimer,
a well-known Devonshire personality...

100
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,580
-"...said today that"...
-If you'll pardon me, Dr. Mortimer...

101
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,810
...I want just the plain facts
in your own words.

102
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,660
Please.

103
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,820
Very well.

104
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,300
The plain facts of the matter are
that a fortnight ago...

105
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,090
...Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead
on the moor.

106
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,260
-Who found him?
-His servant, Barrymore.

107
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,360
He and his wife are housekeepers
up at Baskerville Hall.

108
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,030
He fetched me at once
and took me back to the body.

109
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,370
Where was the body? Dartmoor, I know,
but exactly where? It's a large place.

110
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,510
Near the abbey ruins up on the hill,
not far from Baskerville Hall.

111
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,420
The place where Sir Hugo died
in the legend...

112
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,260
...and the circumstances were
exactly the same.

113
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,030
You mean Sir Charles had been attacked?

114
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,190
-That his throat had been torn out?
-No. The body was untouched.

115
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,130
But his face...

116
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,070
Never in all my medical career have I seen
such a look of horror on a dead person.

117
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,140
Sir Charles must have been terrified
when he died.

118
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,870
But he was alone.

119
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,180
The strange thing was,
there were no footprints, Mr. Holmes.

120
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,310
That cannot be quite true.

121
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,950
There were the servants', for instance,
your own, and Sir Charles'.

122
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,250
Yes, of course,
but what I meant to say was...

123
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,190
...there were no other footprints.

124
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,460
Facts are only of value
when they're clear, concise, and correct.

125
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,990
Pray, continue.

126
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,100
And there was another strange thing.

127
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,640
Sir Charles must've been tiptoeing
back to Baskerville Hall when he died.

128
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,570
I could tell that because the footmarks
showed only the toes of his boots.

129
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,110
There were no heel marks.

130
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,050
I'm something of an archaeologist
in my spare time...

131
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,640
...and so I'm used to looking for
the extraordinary.

132
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,350
You have not yet told us
what Sir Charles died of.

133
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,890
Before you do, sir,
I suggest it was heart failure.

134
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,720
The inquest found
that he died of arteriosclerosis...

135
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,460
...a disease of the coronary arteries.

136
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,990
A condition of the heart...

137
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,230
...that can lead to heart failure.

138
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,040
Yes. I think it must be hereditary
with the Baskervilles.

139
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,800
They all seem to suffer
from the same weakness.

140
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,910
Is there a successor to the family title?

141
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,170
Yes. Sir Henry Baskerville.

142
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,410
He's due to arrive in London tonight
from Johannesburg.

143
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,780
Why have you come to me,
when you really don't believe...

144
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,620
...that I can help you?

145
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,090
-I don't think I know what you mean.
-I think you do.

146
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,960
Excuse me.

147
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,260
Although you knew the cause of death,
you've implied a more horrible death...

148
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,140
...that he might have seen the hound
of Hell, the curse of the Baskervilles.

149
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,240
Do you really believe that legend?

150
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,800
There are many things in life and death
that we do not understand.

151
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,440
Then I suggest you consult a priest
instead of a detective.

152
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,070
Do you think I can influence
the powers of darkness?

153
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,380
Of course not.

154
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,320
I thought you might prevent Sir Henry
from going into danger.

155
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,520
If there is an evil curse on the family...

156
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,460
...it can be just as powerful in London
as in Devonshire.

157
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,400
-Where will he be staying?
-At the Northumberland Hotel.

158
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,760
Does this mean
that you'll investigate the matter?

159
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,360
I have not said.
My commitments are heavy.

160
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,270
I beg of you, Mr. Holmes,
this is a matter of life and death.

161
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,040
There can be no harm done
by my seeing the man.

162
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,550
Shall we say 10:00 tomorrow morning,
at the hotel?

163
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,880
Good. That will suit admirably.

164
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,210
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

165
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,920
You will not find me ungenerous
in the matter of fees.

166
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,880
My professional charges are
upon a fixed scale.

167
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,760
I do not vary them,
except when I remit them altogether.

168
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,420
Good day.

169
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,530
Good day, Mr. Holmes.

170
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,370
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Not at all, Doctor.

171
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,010
Good day, Dr. Watson.

172
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,740
I must say,
you never cease to surprise me, Holmes.

173
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,720
First you tear him apart,
and then you say you'll help him.

174
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,790
My dear Watson,
you ought to know me better.

175
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,260
I had to burst the balloon,
deflate his pomposity...

176
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,920
...to find one significant clue.

177
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,690
I saw nothing of significance
in anything he said.

178
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,460
I'm surprised you bothered with him.

179
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,860
Nevertheless,
one important point did emerge.

180
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,030
Didn't you notice anything odd
in what he said?

181
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,070
The only thing I noticed
was that he said Sir Charles...

182
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,640
...was tiptoeing about Dartmoor at night.

183
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,070
That's just it, Watson. Well done, my boy.
But he wasn't tiptoeing.

184
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,900
He was running, running for his life...

185
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,350
...running in panic
until he burst his heart.

186
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,450
Would you mind sorting out
a large-scale map of Dartmoor...

187
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,350
...while I find some more tobacco.
This, I think, is a two-pipe problem.

188
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,030
Come in.

189
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,040
So you finally managed to get here.

190
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,700
I didn't know we'd kept you.

191
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,140
Kept me?
I sent for you over 20 minutes ago.

192
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,770
-I think perhaps you've made a mistake.
-I've made a mistake, all right.

193
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,320
The mistake I made was
in ever coming to this hotel.

194
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,850
What did you find out
about my other boot?

195
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,920
They were both here last night.

196
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,920
But nobody knows:
the porter, the maid, the boot boy.

197
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,990
Nobody in this hotel of yours knows
where the other one's gone to.

198
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,730
You're the manager.

199
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,770
Perhaps you'll tell me
what you do with all your boots.

200
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm a few minutes late, I'm afraid.
Those confounded horse buses.

201
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,910
However, I see you've all met,
we might as well get down to business.

202
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,280
We have not been given an opportunity
to introduce ourselves.

203
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,250
I'm so sorry. Please, let me.

204
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,980
Sir Henry,
let me introduce Mr. Sherlock Holmes...

205
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,550
...Dr. Watson. Sir Henry Baskerville.

206
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm afraid you're a little late, Mortimer.

207
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,590
I've already managed
to make quite a fool of myself.

208
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,600
Gentlemen,
I must ask you to accept my apologies.

209
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,430
Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes.

210
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,200
-How do you do?
-Glad to meet you both.

211
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,640
-I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.
-Say no more.

212
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,900
-It was quite understandable.
-Yes, indeed.

213
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,310
I hope that the missing boot
will turn up very soon.

214
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,440
So do I.

215
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,880
I can understand somebody
wanting to steal a pair of boots, but one?

216
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,850
There it is.

217
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,580
-Please, sit down, gentlemen.
-Why, thank you.

218
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,480
Now, Mr. Holmes...

219
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,290
Dr. Mortimer has, no doubt,
explained why he's asked us to come here.

220
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,890
He has, and I may as well tell you,
I consider him to have been...

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,560
...somewhat hasty in asking your advice.

222
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,900
Surely,
it was only to protect your interests.

223
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,100
He has told you of the legend
of the hound of the Baskervilles?

224
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,840
Yes, but I don't attach any importance to
that sort of old wives' tale.

225
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,880
A man after my own heart.

226
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,170
You intend to go down to Devonshire
and live at Baskerville Hall?

227
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,220
I've already come a very long way
to do exactly that...

228
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,910
...and nothing is going to stop me.

229
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,650
-You can understand that, surely.
-I can indeed.

230
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,320
The estate must be worth a vast amount.
Exactly how much, Dr. Mortimer?

231
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,020
You will forgive me
if I ask a very personal question?

232
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,620
-Of course.
-Well?

233
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,130
When everything's settled up,
I suppose, close on £1 million.

234
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,300
Did anyone else benefit
under Sir Charles' will?

235
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,600
Yes. He left the Barrymores £1,000...

236
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,900
...which I thought was rather generous...

237
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,470
...and I myself received something.

238
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,810
-How much?
-Is this really necessary?

239
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,950
I would not have asked, otherwise.

240
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,820
Very well.

241
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,210
He left me £40,000.

242
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,150
Then, you see,
I was Sir Charles' best friend.

243
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,560
-Were there no other relatives?
-No.

244
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,890
Sir Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,230
That's why I'm anxious
to safeguard his interests.

246
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,160
Very wise of you.

247
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,330
One thing is certain, Sir Henry.

248
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,900
On no account must you go down
to Devonshire alone.

249
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,980
That's taken care of.
Dr. Mortimer's coming with me.

250
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,610
Dr. Mortimer will have
his practice to attend to.

251
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,850
I can look after myself, Mr. Holmes.

252
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,490
I must impress upon you that I believe
your life to be in considerable danger.

253
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,420
Now, look,
if you attach so much importance to this...

254
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,890
...why don't you come down
to Dartmoor with me today?

255
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,960
-You can pack before the train leaves.
-You're going today?

256
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,720
I can't possibly leave town
until the end of the week at least.

257
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,500
-Watson?
-Yeah.

258
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,570
You're free at the moment, aren't you?

259
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes, I am...

260
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,670
...if you think I could do the job.

261
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,740
You're the very man. That's settled.
You'll go down with him.

262
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,110
We'll keep in touch by telegram.

263
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,510
Sir Henry,
I am not a man to overestimate danger...

264
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,750
...but I must insist upon one thing:

265
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,650
Under no circumstances...

266
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,490
...are you to venture out
onto the moor alone at night.

267
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,020
Very well.

268
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,960
As things have gone this far,
I'll do as you say, for now.

269
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,630
But I'm not yet convinced
that I need the services...

270
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,430
...of a detective at all...

271
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,270
...unless it'd help me find my other boot.

272
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,130
Sir Henry, keep perfectly still...

273
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,980
...if you value your life.

274
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,100
Move your head. Carefully.

275
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,900
I can't.

276
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,700
You must.

277
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,650
Leave it to me now.

278
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,490
No! Look after him.
Brandy, Mortimer, quickly.

279
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,000
Here you are.

280
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,310
What a filthy thing. Horrible.

281
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,280
You've had a lucky escape...

282
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,710
...but we must make certain
never to be caught off our guard again.

283
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,910
Are you suggesting that that thing
was put in there deliberately?

284
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,310
The powers of evil can take many forms.

285
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,490
Remember that, Sir Henry,
when you're at Baskerville Hall.

286
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,560
Do as the legend tells...

287
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,030
...and avoid the moor
when the forces of darkness are exalted.

288
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,620
Are you sure you don't want
a ride to the village?

289
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,920
Quite sure.
It'll only take you out of your way...

290
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,020
...whereas it's a short walk
across the moor.

291
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,160
You'd be better off to go along with us.

292
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,700
Kindly wait until you're spoken to,
and get on with what you're doing.

293
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,140
Whatever you say, but don't blame me
if you get your throat cut.

294
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,510
-What are you talking about, man?
-There's been an escape.

295
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,840
-An escape? When?
-Night before last. Man named Selden.

296
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,340
Nasty customer, from all accounts.

297
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,080
What's all this about?

298
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,620
Forgive me, Sir Henry,
you wouldn't know about it.

299
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,050
One of our largest prisons,
called Dartmoor...

300
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,490
...lies only seven miles across the moor.

301
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,460
It appears that
one of the prisoners has broken out.

302
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,790
Selden. Yes, I remember the case.

303
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,730
He murdered a number of street women.

304
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,100
-I thought people hanged for murder here.
-There was some talk of him being insane...

305
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,870
...so they sentenced him
to life imprisonment instead.

306
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
Won't do him no good, though, escaping.

307
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,880
He'd only starve himself to death
out there, or something worse.

308
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,580
-What do you mean by that?
-Why, nothing, sir.

309
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,550
Just my foolishness.

310
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,760
I feel you should let us
take you into the village.

311
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,150
He might be anywhere out there.

312
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,750
Don't worry about me.
I can look after myself.

313
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,320
Goodbye.

314
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,560
Goodbye.

315
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,260
All right, Perkins.

316
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,740
A curse upon the family...

317
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,580
...unhappiness and death
to his descendants.

318
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,810
That's what he left, Sir Henry.

319
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,510
Certainly has a lot to answer for.

320
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,050
What about this one here?

321
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,050
That was another picture of Sir Hugo.

322
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,180
It disappeared under mysterious
circumstances some months back.

323
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,020
-You mean it was stolen?
-In the middle of the night.

324
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,260
And what steps were taken to recover it?

325
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,000
Your uncle called in the police from
Exeter, but they could find no trace.

326
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,200
One picture of that scoundrel is
more than enough.

327
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,810
What do you say, Watson?

328
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,070
Your glass is empty. Please...

329
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,880
You must be bored to tears
by all this rigmarole about my family.

330
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,890
-You must think me a terrible host.
-Not at all.

331
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,820
-I've found it extremely interesting.
-Have you?

332
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,820
It's very nice of you to say so.

333
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,090
-Barrymore.
-Sir?

334
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,020
Would you and your good wife care
to join me in a toast?

335
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,530
That's most kind of you, Sir Henry.

336
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,840
Let us drink to my first day
at Baskerville Hall...

337
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,030
...and to my firm belief...

338
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,040
...that the family curse
is nothing but a legend...

339
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,340
...and that the hound of Hell
will never again bring fear...

340
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,180
...to those on the moor at night.

341
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,930
I must ask you to excuse
my wife's behavior, Sir Henry.

342
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,460
She was most upset by Sir Charles' death.

343
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,530
Her nerves have been
in a bad way ever since.

344
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,470
I'm very sorry to hear that.

345
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,470
Watson,
can you give her something for her nerves?

346
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,470
Yes. Yes, of course. I will.

347
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,900
Barrymore?

348
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,170
Since you've mentioned
Sir Charles' death...

349
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,810
...perhaps you could tell us
a little more about it.

350
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,350
You were the first to discover the body,
weren't you?

351
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,750
That's correct. It was terrible, sir.

352
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,550
I never saw such a dreadful look
on anybody's face before.

353
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,220
You found Sir Charles' body
up near the old Abbey, I understand.

354
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,930
What made you go up there
to look for him?

355
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,400
I didn't, sir.

356
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,340
I was on my way to tell Dr. Mortimer
that he was missing, and then I...

357
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,380
Then I saw Sir Charles lying there dead.

358
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,110
But what made you decide to go across
the moor to look for Sir Charles?

359
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,510
I've had a look at a map of the locality...

360
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,880
...and surely it would've been quicker
to have taken the trap and gone by road.

361
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,650
There's a shortcut across the moor, sir.

362
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,490
Barrymore...

363
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,760
...did you go across the moor because
you half expected to find Sir Charles...

364
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,730
...because of the legend?

365
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,260
You know about the legend of the
hound of the Baskervilles, don't you?

366
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,330
Do you believe it?

367
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,040
Do you really believe
that there is a creature out there?

368
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,180
I don't know what to believe, sir.

369
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,450
What I know is that I've heard it...

370
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,990
...heard its terrible howl
on the night before Sir Charles died...

371
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,260
...and I never want to hear
such a sound again in all my life.

372
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,720
-Can I help you, sir?
-No, thank you.

373
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,090
It's got away.
Damn it. I could've done with that.

374
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,530
Excellent specimen of Coleoptera scabrus.

375
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,660
I collect them, you know.

376
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,660
-Why, it's Sir Henry.
-It is.

377
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,800
Yeah, the Baskerville mouth.
I could have recognized you anywhere...

378
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,310
...even among the natives.

379
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,240
Frankland is the name.

380
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,510
Frankland, Bishop of the outer isles...

381
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,380
...for what they're worth.

382
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,780
Very glad to meet you, sir.
Won't you come in?

383
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,180
Thank you.

384
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,590
Yes. How good.

385
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,220
How very good to see a new owner
of Baskerville Hall.

386
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,670
That's not quite what I meant...

387
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,530
Poor Sir Charles.

388
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
What a splendid fellow he was.

389
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,800
So you knew my uncle?

390
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,000
Knew him? My dear fellow,
we were the greatest friends.

391
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,840
How many times Sir Charles and I
have discussed life, you know...

392
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,480
...over a glass of sherry.

393
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,690
In that case, perhaps you'd care
to join me in a glass of sherry now.

394
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,490
Now you've mentioned sherry...

395
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,720
...I think perhaps I might like a glass.

396
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,460
I saw Bishop Frankland
coming up the drive, Sir Henry.

397
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,130
Barrymore...

398
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,040
...still the faithful retainer.

399
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,110
Thank you.

400
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,010
-For you, Sir Henry?
-No, thank you, Barrymore.

401
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,040
"That's the best sherry in Devon,"
I always say.

402
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,980
Sir Charles knew
his creature comforts, all right.

403
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,250
Seen him with some
very attractive creatures at times.

404
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,590
Yes, he knew a woman when he saw one,
did Sir Charles.

405
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,220
Yes. Poor fellow.

406
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,390
May he rest in peace.

407
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,330
What a loss.

408
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,800
Thank you.
I think I should like another glass, yes.

409
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,370
Watson,
I don't think you've met the Bishop.

410
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,180
-Bishop Frankland, Dr. Watson.
-How do you do?

411
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,350
Watson, you say the name is?
Yes, I knew a Watson in Caprina.

412
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,680
Yes, a notorious white slaver.
Nice fellow, though. Relation of yours?

413
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,760
No, sir. Not that I know of.

414
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,990
But, of course, it is possible.

415
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,830
You've come to approve
the new Lord of the manor I imagine?

416
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,690
-It's not necessary.
-Thank you.

417
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,930
But why have I come?

418
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,630
-Yes, of course. The jumble sale.
-Jumble sale? What on earth's that?

419
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,870
It's a colloquial expression, Sir Henry.
A sale of oddments.

420
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,380
And I was wondering if you had anything
you could spare for us.

421
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,640
An odd tablecloth or an old suit
or some cast-off silver?

422
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,910
I'm sure I can. I'll ask Mrs. Barrymore.

423
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,380
That's very kind of you.

424
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,250
May I give you the address
in which you could have them sent?

425
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,620
I'm sure we shall all be
very grateful to you...

426
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,790
...very grateful, indeed,
if you'd have them sent there.

427
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,130
Now, I shan't apologize for the tract.

428
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,140
It's really rather charming.

429
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,600
"All things bright and beautiful."

430
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,070
Thank you.

431
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,700
I'm just going down to the village
to leave instructions at the post office.

432
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,880
If you'll excuse me, my Lord Bishop.

433
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,081
Of course. I'd give you
a lift on the tricycle

434
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:07,750
but I wanted
to chat with Sir Henry.

435
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,150
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

436
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,350
I'm afraid you'll be expected
to open the sale, Sir Henry...

437
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,430
...and judge the prettiest mother and baby.

438
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,860
Do you know, dear old Sir Charles,
he loved doing that?

439
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,400
Yeah. He did, indeed.

440
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,130
I remember one occasion
when one of the babies wet...

441
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,640
Dear.

442
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,010
Don't move. Stay where you are.

443
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,660
I said not to move, sir.

444
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,730
You've no call to use that kind of trap.
It's unnecessarily cruel.

445
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,930
A man's got to live.

446
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,630
There are ways of killing animals
without torturing them.

447
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,610
Why don't you use a gun?

448
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,170
-I'm sorry.
-Besides, cartridges cost money.

449
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Some of us haven't got any to spend.
It's a poor life on the moor, Sir Henry.

450
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,650
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
My name is Watson...

451
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,620
...though I'm staying at Baskerville Hall.

452
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,720
-With Sir Henry?
-Yes.

453
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,460
Tell the new squire his new neighbor
would like to meet him.

454
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,330
I farm the lower pastures near the hall.
Have done for nearly a year.

455
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,330
Poor land it is, too.

456
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,030
-What name is it?
-Stapleton.

457
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,070
Very well. I'll tell Sir Henry.

458
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,700
I wonder, could you tell me
how to get to Baskerville Hall?

459
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,410
-I seem to have lost my way.
-You'll bear right at the fork.

460
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,580
Thank you.

461
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,880
Mr. Watson...

462
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,080
Don't step off the track
or you'll find yourself in Grimpen Mire.

463
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,180
Once in there, you'll never get out.

464
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,260
Thank you.

465
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,190
Good morning.

466
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,230
I wonder, could you tell me,
am I on the right path to Baskerville Hall?

467
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,990
The track seems to end here.

468
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,770
Watch out!

469
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,240
The mire!

470
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,220
I say!

471
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,440
Cecile, come back!

472
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,930
Hold on.

473
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,600
You wait, my girl,
I'll teach you to come when I call.

474
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,640
Get the cart down as near here as you can.

475
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,840
Be quick about it.
Will you do as you're told, girl?

476
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,680
I told you to watch out.

477
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,740
-Who is that girl?
-My daughter.

478
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,010
The moor's no place for a girl.

479
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,750
-What was she frightened of?
-There's a convict escaped from the prison.

480
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,650
I'll help you to the cart.
Watch where I step.

481
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,770
Thank you.

482
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,140
Now that you're here, would you like
to come in and see Sir Henry?

483
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,690
-It's as good a time as any.
-How about Miss Stapleton?

484
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:12,050
-Would she like to come in, too?
-She'll wait where she is.

485
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,820
Very well.

486
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,390
Well, good morning, Miss Stapleton.

487
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
Hello.

488
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,470
If you're looking for the new owner,
he's not at home.

489
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,210
Go away.

490
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,950
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm Henry Baskerville.

491
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,010
-May I ask...
-Please, go away.

492
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,660
My father will be out in a moment.

493
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,090
So your father's gone into the hall?

494
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,560
-Let's join him.
-No. Don't.

495
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,800
Here. You wait a minute.

496
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,510
-Leave me alone!
-Just a minute! Calm down!

497
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,220
Now, why did you run away?

498
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Why did you run away?
I've done nothing to frighten you.

499
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,380
-My father.
-What about your father?

500
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,460
-He would have seen us.
-What of it?

501
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,670
Now, would you let me go?

502
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,300
Cecile!

503
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,410
Where have you been?

504
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,780
Come on, girl. Where have you been?

505
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,150
-Good morning.
-Morning.

506
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,220
-Sir Henry Baskerville, isn't it?
-Yes.

507
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,220
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

508
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,720
My name is Stapleton.
Welcome to Dartmoor.

509
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,390
-You're very kind.
-I run the home farm.

510
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,860
You'll be very welcome
whenever you're that way.

511
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,400
We must be getting on our way,
mustn't we, Cecile?

512
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,500
-Good day to you, sir.
-Good day.

513
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,010
Come on!

514
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,530
Watson, here.

515
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,260
Move the candle about. Quickly.

516
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,870
I swear I saw a light out there on the moor
as soon as you picked up the candle.

517
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,640
Someone out there is signaling
to the house. Come.

518
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,610
Whatever happens, Sir Henry,
you must stay with me.

519
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,300
-We're still in line with the light.
-Yes, but we're not near enough yet.

520
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,740
Keep close to me. Don't go off left,
or you'll be in Grimpen Mire.

521
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,820
Right?

522
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,220
Come on.

523
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,160
Come out! We're armed!

524
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,770
They've gone.

525
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,740
Whoever they are,
they must have heard us.

526
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,950
Watson!

527
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,810
Come on! There's still a chance.

528
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,190
No, no. Quiet. Listen.

529
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,640
He's down there somewhere.

530
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,270
What was that, Watson? What was that?

531
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,620
It's my heart.

532
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,890
Drink some of this.

533
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,700
Will you be able to get back if I help you?

534
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,170
I'll try.

535
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,070
Come on, then.

536
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,440
That is for me to decide, Sir Henry.

537
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,620
I suggest that you have a little rest.

538
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,190
-Good night.
-Good night.

539
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,200
I really don't know
why you bothered to send for me.

540
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,990
After all, as a doctor,
you're just as capable as I am.

541
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,730
Does your diagnosis confirm mine?

542
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,600
He has a similar heart condition
to his uncle, agreed.

543
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,610
Hereditary, no doubt,
but nowhere near so far advanced.

544
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,210
All the same, I'd like to leave him
in your charge until I get back.

545
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,450
If you insist.

546
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,780
Anyway, my night's sleep is ruined,
but I really can't see that it's necessary.

547
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,290
Nevertheless,
I'd appreciate it if you would stay.

548
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,860
It's essential that I go back to the moor.

549
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,420
All right. I'll stay.

550
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,600
Why have you left Sir Henry alone?

551
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,800
Holmes.

552
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,740
I repeat,
why have you left Sir Henry alone?

553
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,800
Dr. Mortimer is with him.

554
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,780
-Anyone else?
-Yes. The Barrymores.

555
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,510
Very well, then.

556
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,950
Forgive me
if my dramatic entrance startled you.

557
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,920
It's good to see you again.
It's been rather lonely up here.

558
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,780
This is fantastic.

559
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:30,540
How long have you been in Devon?

560
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,720
Four hours and 52 minutes less than you.

561
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,920
I caught the next train down after yours.

562
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,490
But your telegram...

563
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,160
I wrote that before I left town
and had it delivered later.

564
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,000
So it was you I saw.

565
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,430
You might have let me know
what you intended to do.

566
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,010
I'm sorry,
but I didn't want it known I was here.

567
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,840
You would have tried to prevent me.

568
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,540
-You will understand, I had to find Selden.
-Selden, the convict?

569
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,710
-That was madness.
-No doubt, but effectual.

570
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,280
-How did you know he was on the moor?
-I read about it in the newspapers.

571
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,450
The escape was well-reported.
I'm surprised you didn't notice it.

572
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,030
He told me all he had seen
since he's been hiding.

573
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,690
What had he seen? What did he tell you?

574
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,600
There is more evil around us here
than I have ever encountered before.

575
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,300
I still don't see...

576
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,250
Mortimer's gone. His ponycart's not there.

577
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,990
-You told him to stay with Sir Henry?
-Indeed, I did.

578
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,940
Which way?
For heaven's sake, which way?

579
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,520
Too late.

580
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,630
-We're too late.
-Sir Henry.

581
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,030
Watch out, Holmes. It's treacherous here.

582
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,800
We must go back and get help,
then come back for the body.

583
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,040
I'm to blame for this.

584
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,640
-I shall never forgive myself.
-I warned him.

585
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,910
What could have possessed him
to come out alone on the moor?

586
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,410
The last of the Baskervilles.

587
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,250
His life was in our hands.

588
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,000
I shall not rest until I destroy
the thing that killed him.

589
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,110
-You're Barrymore, I take it.
-Yes, sir.

590
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,560
Barrymore, I want you to get a ladder,
some rope, and lanterns...

591
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,130
...and load them on the cart
within five minutes.

592
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,260
You understand?

593
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,460
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

594
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,970
-Where's your room?
-This way. I'll show you.

595
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,560
And have those attended to, will you?

596
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,060
Very good, sir.

597
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,470
I'll need a pair of dry stud boots
and a heavy coat before we go out again.

598
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,640
Yes, of course.

599
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:46,480
You know, Holmes, I can't help feeling
that if I hadn't left Sir Henry alone...

600
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,050
We're to avenge his death,
not mourn over it.

601
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:50,750
No. This way.

602
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,990
Who's there?

603
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,090
Holmes. For heaven's sake,
when did you get here?

604
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,260
I am glad to see you again.

605
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,700
I am more than glad to see you, Sir Henry.

606
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,230
Who was it, Holmes?

607
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,140
Who was the poor devil
that died instead of me?

608
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,270
If my deductions are correct,
it was the convict, Selden.

609
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,470
He was a murderer, I know,
but he shouldn't have died that way.

610
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:56,080
But why him? The curse is only
on the Baskervilles. Is no one safe?

611
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,120
Selden had on the suit you were wearing
when we met in London.

612
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,020
-How did he get them?
-He must've broken in and stolen them.

613
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,990
Possibly, but unlikely.

614
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,450
Sir Henry...

615
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,120
...why did Dr. Mortimer leave
so suddenly tonight?

616
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,830
He told me that he'd stay until I got back.

617
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,030
Stupid row, really.

618
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,970
He kept on about my uncle's death
and the curse on the family, and...

619
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,910
...I asked if he was trying to frighten me
and told him to mind his business.

620
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,380
I should like a few words
with Dr. Mortimer sometime.

621
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,250
Excuse me, Sir Henry.
Is there anything else you require?

622
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,910
No, thank you, Barrymore,
not as far as I'm concerned.

623
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,460
-You've prepared a room for Mr. Holmes?
-Yes, sir.

624
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:35,250
Will you still be needing the ladder
and rope you asked for tonight, sir?

625
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,030
No. Not now.

626
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,660
But I shall want them and your help
in the morning.

627
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,860
Very good, sir.

628
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,760
-Barrymore.
-Sir?

629
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,390
That room at the end of
the corridor upstairs:

630
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,470
Has it been used lately?

631
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,900
-Not for some time, sir.
-I see.

632
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,510
I think you'll find a candle burning
near the window in that room.

633
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,780
Do kindly extinguish it.
It's serving no useful purpose.

634
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,880
-Very good, sir.
-Thank you.

635
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,790
And now, with your permission, to bed.

636
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,530
Yes. We could all do with
a good night's sleep.

637
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:26,240
This, I perceive, is Sir Hugo Baskerville,
the man who started all the trouble.

638
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,950
Yes, it is. How the devil did you know?

639
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,350
Family likeness. There are certain features
that are unmistakable.

640
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,480
What happened to the picture
that hung here?

641
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,180
That one? Nobody knows.
It disappeared some time ago.

642
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,310
Yes.

643
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,290
Yes, of course. It had to. Stupid of me.

644
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,390
Yes. Good night.

645
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,630
That's strange. There's nothing there.

646
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,500
I could have sworn that that was the spot.

647
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:59,800
It must be more over this way.

648
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,240
No, Watson. You were right.

649
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,650
This was the place. Look at this.

650
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,220
Here's another trace...

651
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,150
...and another.

652
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,480
You can see where they're leading to.

653
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,160
-Barrymore!
-Sir?

654
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,390
Tell Perkins to bring the cart
up to the ruins, then follow us.

655
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,970
-Yes, sir.
-We won't find the body down here.

656
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,280
By heavens, what's been going on here?

657
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,020
The Baskerville crest,
engraved on the hilt.

658
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,620
Mr. Holmes!

659
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:29,130
As I thought. Selden.

660
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,760
His body's been mutilated.

661
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,640
Some revolting sacrificial rite
has been performed.

662
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,040
-What depths a human being can sink to.
-What human being could have done this?

663
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,680
That is precisely what
I intend to find out.

664
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,030
-You rang for me, sir?
-I did, Mrs. Barrymore. Sit down, please.

665
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,130
-No, thank you, sir. I prefer to stand.
-As you wish.

666
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,640
I want to ask you and your husband
a few questions, if you don't mind.

667
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,940
-How long have you been married?
-Married?

668
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,110
-Must be almost five years now, isn't it?
-Is that right, Miss Selden?

669
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,480
Yes, sir. We got married about...

670
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,780
Please, sit down.

671
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,160
Your name was Selden before you married,
wasn't it?

672
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,460
And the convict who escaped
was your brother?

673
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,730
-How did you know?
-Your brother told me.

674
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,000
-He's dead, sir, isn't he?
-Yes, I'm afraid he is.

675
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,700
How did it happen?

676
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,410
You gave Selden some of
Sir Henry's clothes, didn't you?

677
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,810
Well, I...

678
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,110
Someone, or something...

679
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,340
...mistook your brother for Sir Henry.

680
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,390
You mustn't blame my husband, sir.
I gave him the clothes.

681
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,320
Sir Henry said I might take them
for the village sale.

682
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,820
Buy why should they have them...

683
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,550
...when my brother was out on the moor,
cold and hungry?

684
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,050
Thank you, sir.

685
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:10,570
I know he was bad, sir,
but he was ill, really...

686
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,770
...and he was my brother.

687
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:17,570
You can't leave someone you love
out there, cold and starving.

688
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:21,980
I understand. It might help you to know
he also told me...

689
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,380
...he would never let them
recapture him alive.

690
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,380
Come along, my dear.

691
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,390
Poor woman.

692
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,120
I suppose when Sir Henry and I
arrived here at the hall...

693
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,700
...she found it difficult
to get food to her brother.

694
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,270
They arranged a signal
with the candle at the window...

695
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,000
...to show him the coast was clear.

696
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:52,240
Couldn't they be charged
with helping an escaped convict?

697
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,800
They could, but they won't.
I've satisfied the local police.

698
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,780
What's the next move?

699
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,110
"All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small."

700
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,710
I wonder if that includes tarantulas.

701
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,290
Tarantulas?

702
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,190
But, Holmes...

703
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,870
-A gentlemen to see you, my lord.
-Good, good. Just in time.

704
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:25,670
Yes, I'm still having trouble with it.
Will you come and have a look at it?

705
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:30,610
Of course, I'm not an engineering man,
but it seems this eccentric is malaligned.

706
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:35,450
Or perhaps if this cam were buffed
to another thou or so...

707
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,020
...it might make all the difference,
don't you think?

708
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,850
-Or perhaps a shim.
-Graphite grease.

709
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,020
What?

710
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,290
Of course, yes. I have got some.

711
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,060
-Do you know, I never thought of it?
-Allow me.

712
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,630
Thank you.

713
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,730
Yes. Silly of me.

714
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,100
-Yes.
-Thank you.

715
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,300
There you are. You'll want that. Yeah.

716
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,540
Now let's see.

717
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,310
Wonderful, wonderful.

718
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,680
That's done the trick, yeah.

719
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:12,220
I wish Mrs. Goodliffe would leave
those windows alone.

720
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,120
Never mind.
Take a glass of sherry before you go.

721
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,920
-Bishop Frankland, I...
-Nonsense.

722
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,900
A little wine, for your stomach's sake.
That's in the Bible.

723
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,260
I think you'll like this.

724
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,270
What do I owe you for your trouble,
and your fare from Exeter, of course?

725
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,700
My Lord,
you've mistaken me for someone else.

726
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,470
No. Only somebody
from Warburton and Crawley...

727
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,170
...could have solved that problem.

728
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,580
Nevertheless,
I am not from Warburton and Crawley.

729
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,480
-Not?
-My name is Sherlock Holmes.

730
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,450
I am staying with Sir Henry Baskerville.

731
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,250
Allow me to shake the hand
of the country's greatest detective.

732
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,050
That case of the Bermondsey forgery,
that was first class.

733
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,260
Thank you. And I am pleased to meet
our most distinguished entomologist.

734
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,230
You've heard of me? How flattering.

735
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,470
I know the directors of the Regents Zoo...

736
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,700
...regard you as the highest living
authority on the study of rare spiders.

737
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,210
Spiders?

738
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,940
It is about that subject
that I have come to see you.

739
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,710
-The species of the genus Theraphosa.
-Tarantula.

740
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,150
Everybody's asking me
about tarantulas these days.

741
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,110
No.

742
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,560
I'm afraid I can't help
you on that subject.

743
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,420
How very disappointing...

744
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,490
...because I've found one.

745
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:30,160
-Found one? Have you, by Jove?
-Dead, fortunately.

746
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,260
Pity. Never mind.

747
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,970
Where did you find it,
somewhere about the village?

748
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,130
-No. In London.
-Up there.

749
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,270
Nevertheless...

750
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,540
...it was the same spider that you lost.

751
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,340
No, impossible. Far too far away.

752
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,210
Are you suggesting that I've lost a spider?

753
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,320
I'm afraid I am. You have, haven't you?

754
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:57,560
You lost a spider sent to you
from the London Zoo about five days ago.

755
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,200
-Are you interested in butterflies?
-My Lord, I must insist.

756
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:07,270
Will it help if I tell you I am fighting
evil, fighting it as surely as you do?

757
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,440
Yes. Very well. I did lose a tarantula.

758
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,070
I missed it last Thursday. I've been
worried out of my life ever since.

759
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,340
They're dangerous.

760
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,910
So I understand. But you needn't worry
any longer. The spider is dead.

761
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:24,610
Now, it is important
that you answer this question correctly.

762
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,620
What visitors did you have
on the day you missed the tarantula?

763
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,950
Visitors?

764
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,090
That's difficult
because Thursday's my at-home day.

765
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,900
I mean, a lot of people like to look in
for sherry and a chat.

766
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,490
Let me see. There was old Mrs. Smythe.

767
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,830
Poor woman. Drinks.

768
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,140
Yes. Dr. Mortimer before lunch.

769
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,680
Dear old Mortimer. How he talks.

770
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,720
The Stapletons to tea.

771
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,650
The man about the woodworm
in the belfry.

772
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,710
Fascinating little creatures.
But the church is full of them, you know?

773
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,290
I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
And the man's name?

774
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,990
-Smith, I think.
-And no one else?

775
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,690
Last Thursday? No.

776
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,100
Thank you, my Lord,
that is all I wish to know.

777
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,400
It has been most kind of you
and most helpful.

778
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,440
And thank you
for helping me with my telescope.

779
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,970
-Not at all.
-Remarkable instrument.

780
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,030
It's surprising what you can see
through a good telescope.

781
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,510
Now, what's going on in the big world?

782
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,580
There's Sir Henry.

783
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,310
Where's he off to?

784
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:33,650
Dear me, this is very interesting.

785
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,780
Come have a look.

786
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,860
Come here. Come have a look.

787
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,270
He's gone.

788
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,810
Anybody at home?

789
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,060
Mr. Stapleton?

790
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,100
Why did you come here?

791
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,640
I'm sorry. You must think me very rude,
but I did knock.

792
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,400
I've come to see your father.

793
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,850
He's not here.
He's gone to Baskerville Hall.

794
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,650
Has he? May I ask why?

795
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,220
To invite you and your friends
to dinner tonight.

796
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,320
That's very kind of him.

797
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,460
Would you like some cider?

798
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:45,750
Thank you very much. I would.

799
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,500
What time are we expected to arrive?

800
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,870
You mean, you will come?

801
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,540
I'm looking forward to it.

802
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,000
It won't be like Baskerville Hall.

803
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:06,680
I haven't spent all my life
at Baskerville Hall, Cecile.

804
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:11,260
-I like your home.
-This is not my home.

805
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,190
My home is in Spain.

806
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,660
You were looking at the picture
of my parents.

807
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,020
My mother was a fine woman...

808
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,430
...a fine Spanish woman.

809
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,800
She would hear nothing
of living in England.

810
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,800
She was born in Spain,
and there she would die, she said.

811
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,110
She did die.

812
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,100
We came here to England.

813
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,510
My father spent all the money
we had saved...

814
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,120
...to come back to England to become
a gentleman farmer in his own country.

815
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,050
But the land he bought is no good.

816
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,060
The money's gone.

817
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,880
We have a saying at home:

818
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,500
"Weeds are not killed by the frost."

819
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,370
We still live.

820
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,780
-Have you ever thought of going back?
-I've thought of nothing else.

821
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,770
My father's too proud to admit he's beaten.

822
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,780
Proud of this.

823
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,580
And so we are left
with the moor and the mist.

824
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,420
-You must be very lonely.
-Yes, I am very lonely.

825
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,730
When you are poor,
no one wants to know you.

826
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,450
I want to know you, Cecile.

827
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,940
Why did you run away from me yesterday,
when we'd hardly met?

828
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,110
Why did you kiss me, Cecile?

829
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,300
Why?

830
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:43,850
I don't know.

831
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:48,750
-Tell me.
-I don't know.

832
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:11,100
Will you meet me tonight at the hall?

833
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,710
We can walk back across the moor.

834
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,710
If you want me to.

835
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,480
Our paths seem to have crossed
this morning, Sir Henry.

836
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:31,730
I suppose you've come
to talk about the farm.

837
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,960
You have cider? Good.
Cecile, fetch another tankard for me.

838
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:39,800
Now, quickly about it, girl.
Do sit down, Sir Henry.

839
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,100
Thank you.

840
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:45,340
I was wondering if you and your guests
would care to join us for a meal tonight?

841
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,400
-Just simple fare, of course.
-Yes, so your daughter's already told me.

842
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,850
I'd be very pleased to.
So will Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.

843
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,510
Good. It will be a change
for us to have visitors.

844
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,650
To your health, sir.

845
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:12,700
But how can you be so certain that
someone took one of the bishop's spiders...

846
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,170
...and deliberately placed it
in Sir Henry's room...

847
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:17,670
...that it wasn't in his luggage
from South Africa?

848
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,140
Elementary, my dear Watson.
There are no tarantulas in South Africa.

849
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,370
Whoever placed it there didn't know that.

850
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,980
Precisely.

851
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,310
But he did know when and where
Sir Henry was arriving...

852
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,850
...and where he'd be staying.

853
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,720
He also knew a great deal
about the Baskerville family.

854
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:38,660
A bite from a tarantula is not
necessarily deadly to a healthy man...

855
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,990
...but to a man with a weak heart...

856
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,960
That points to somebody
from this part of the country.

857
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,030
Why not?

858
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,600
There's an fine train service
to and from London...

859
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,270
...and as Sir Charles died here
only a month ago...

860
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:53,000
...it's less suspicious
for Sir Henry to die in London.

861
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,780
Sir Charles, I'd almost
forgotten about him.

862
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,340
-It's a good thing I remembered, wasn't it?
-All right.

863
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:02,720
But the person who benefited most
from his will was Sir Henry.

864
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:05,250
You're not going to suggest
that he killed his uncle?

865
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,790
£1 million is a great temptation.

866
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,860
In a case such as this,
everyone is suspect, even Sir Henry.

867
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:15,030
Dr. Mortimer was the only one who knew
where Sir Henry would be in London...

868
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,600
...and when he was arriving.

869
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,570
No. No.
The London Times would have published it.

870
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,200
What about the legend
of the hound of Hell?

871
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,670
Remember,
we've both seen something of its horror.

872
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,180
Watson! You inspire me!

873
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,370
Let me see your map, quickly.

874
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,040
Selden swore he heard his cries
coming from the very depths of the Earth.

875
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,180
The hound of Hell. Let me see.

876
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:41,320
Really, I must pull myself together.
I should have noticed this long ago.

877
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,000
Holmes. Barrymore told me you'd arrived.

878
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,230
And about time, too, if I may say so...

879
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,240
...considering what happened
to that convict fellow last night.

880
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,710
A development I deeply regret,
Dr. Mortimer.

881
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,040
I don't.

882
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,770
A man like that deserves all he gets.

883
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,210
In case you're both wondering
why I'm here...

884
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,910
...I've just come over
to start looking through the family estate.

885
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,250
I think I'm wasting my time, if you ask me.

886
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,820
You know, really, Holmes...

887
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,020
...I find it quite impossible
to get on with Sir Henry.

888
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:19,820
I understand you had a disagreement
with him last night.

889
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,090
Disagreement?

890
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,260
He was downright rude,
if that's what you mean.

891
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,560
Hardly an excuse to leave him alone
when you know he's in danger.

892
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,570
You told me you'd stay with Sir Henry
until I got back.

893
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:30,830
What if I did?

894
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,500
I don't see why I should be insulted
by the man I'm trying to protect.

895
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:37,270
After all,
I only mentioned the subject of the legend.

896
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,150
Now, you are very fond of doing that,
Dr. Mortimer. Why?

897
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,790
Weren't you the first to discover
the existence of the legend?

898
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:45,010
Mr. Holmes...

899
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,110
...when I engaged you...

900
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:49,960
...I looked to you
to protect Sir Henry's interests.

901
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,100
I'm beginning to see, for the first time
in my life, I was wrong in my judgment.

902
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,430
-If you care to relinquish the case...
-I never relinquish!

903
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,800
-Mr. Holmes... -Please, don't
let us fall out at this stage.

904
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,870
I need your help, unfortunately.

905
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:09,640
You know a lot about the geography
and history of this district, I believe.

906
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,210
I am considered something of an authority.

907
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,110
There's an old tin mine
marked here on the map.

908
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,520
-Does it still exist?
-I believe so.

909
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,320
What of it? It's been derelict for years.

910
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,790
Yes,
I rather fear this map a wee out of date.

911
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,020
Could you show me
the way to the entrance?

912
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,790
What on earth for?

913
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:30,860
Could you?

914
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,230
I'm afraid not.

915
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,800
I haven't been near there for years.
Perhaps Stapleton can help you.

916
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,910
It lies under his ground.

917
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:42,710
If he agreed to show me,
would you come with us?

918
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:46,470
I suggest that you stay away
from the mine, Mr. Holmes.

919
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,620
It hasn't been in use for a long time,
the shaft is in a dangerous condition.

920
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,420
How do you know,
if you haven't been there for years?

921
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,650
It's obvious, isn't it?

922
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:59,800
Any tunneling is dangerous
if it isn't in a state of repair.

923
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,830
Still, I feel I must take a look at it.
Will you come with me?

924
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:06,030
As an archeologist,
your help will be invaluable.

925
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,600
I suppose, if you're going to make
an issue of it, I shall have to come.

926
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,470
-Good. Good man.
-What do you want me to do?

927
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,170
Identify anything I may find.

928
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,410
Strange things are to be found
on the moor.

929
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:18,510
Like this, for instance!

930
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:27,480
-Where did you find that?
-Interesting, isn't it?

931
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:29,420
Could you tell me how old it is?

932
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:31,250
I'm not sure.

933
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,000
-About 1700, I imagine.
-1740, to be exact.

934
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,620
And the blood, how old is that?

935
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:37,760
I couldn't tell.

936
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:40,390
Then I will tell you.
It is less than 10 hours old.

937
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,970
Could you tell me anything else
about the weapon?

938
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,370
No? Come, come.

939
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,980
With your knowledge of the legend,
I made certain you ought to know.

940
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:54,640
It's the dagger Sir Hugo used
to murder the girl in the abbey.

941
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:58,590
And more recently, it has been used
for some diabolical ceremony.

942
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,130
All right, Watson,
we're all down quite safely.

943
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,630
Good! I'll be waiting for you here!

944
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,360
I don't expect we shall be very long.

945
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,600
You'd both better follow close behind me
for the moment.

946
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,800
You'll have to watch your step.
It's very slippery down here.

947
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,470
The water seeps through from the mire.

948
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,640
Don't touch any of the props,
whatever you do!

949
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,180
We'll have the whole roof down on us.

950
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,150
We should never have come down here.
It's far too dangerous.

951
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,910
What do you expect to find, Mr. Holmes?

952
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,920
What is one likely to find
under the ground?

953
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,850
Bones, perhaps.

954
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,820
This is dangerous.

955
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,360
You carry on, Mr. Holmes,
while we chock the wheels.

956
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,350
-Certainly.
-Here you are.

957
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:44,920
Thank you.

958
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,350
We won't need to go any further.
I've found what I came down for.

959
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,180
No good, Watson?

960
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,180
Leave the lanterns there, Mr. Stapleton.

961
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,030
We must go to the village
and get some help.

962
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,140
I'm afraid it won't do no good, sir.

963
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,700
Must be a ton of rock
blocking that shaft there.

964
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,470
We must try.

965
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:40,900
You must resign yourself to the fact
that there's no hope of him being alive.

966
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:44,540
-Don't you agree, Stapleton?
-You know as much about it as I do.

967
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,880
It's over two hours since the roof fell.

968
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,950
You've been down there.
We've heard nothing.

969
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,250
Not likely to,
with all that rock in front of us.

970
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,190
That don't mean to say he's not alive.

971
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:57,420
Plenty of air in that old mine.
Comes in from them ventilating shafts.

972
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,050
Couldn't we get down one of them
and find him that way?

973
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,360
I wouldn't like to say, sir.

974
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,830
I doubt there's a man
as knows them entrances.

975
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,270
We must try to find one.

976
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:08,860
Mr. Stapleton, will you lead us back
to the path immediately, please?

977
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,710
I did warn him not to go.

978
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,050
You were there. You heard me, didn't you?

979
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:23,350
-There's still a chance.
-A very good chance.

980
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:26,220
I've been waiting for you
for the last 10 minutes.

981
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,920
Holmes!

982
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:33,560
-Thank heaven you're safe.
-How did you get out? This is wonderful.

983
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,330
That's gratifying.

984
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:39,160
When the applause has died down,
I wonder if we could get back to the hall.

985
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,970
I've hurt my leg, I'm cold, and I'm hungry.

986
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,470
Will you please stop behaving
like a maiden aunt.

987
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:49,810
If I hadn't known there were
a number of entrances to the mine...

988
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:53,040
-...I'd never have gone down.
-But for a wretched old beef bone...

989
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:56,280
It is not a wretched old beef bone.
That's just the point.

990
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:57,550
It's a relatively new one.

991
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,990
-But I...
-No buts.

992
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,350
Would you mind, please,
passing me my tobacco?

993
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:05,460
-Where is it? -You'll find it
in the top right-hand drawer.

994
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,120
An unopened tin.

995
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:13,630
-You must have put it somewhere else.
-The right-hand top drawer.

996
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:17,370
-I'm looking in the right-hand top drawer.
-Isn't it there?

997
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,810
I've just told you it isn't there.

998
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,200
Here it is.

999
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:24,180
Just a minute.
I know I put it there this morning.

1000
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,770
Watson, the bottom drawer,
where I put the dagger...

1001
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,580
...is it still locked?

1002
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,610
No.

1003
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:33,180
Holmes, the lock's been forced!

1004
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,620
The dagger's not there.

1005
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:39,590
Watson.

1006
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,570
How's the leg feeling now?

1007
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:45,700
-Not very good.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

1008
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,560
I wasn't able to tell you before...

1009
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:50,270
...but Stapleton has asked us over
for a meal tonight.

1010
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:54,140
-Has he?
-Yes. I thought it was a very nice gesture.

1011
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,810
Still, I don't suppose you'll feel
like going with your leg the way it is.

1012
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,970
No, I don't.

1013
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:03,810
They'll be very disappointed,
and Cecile is waiting for me downstairs.

1014
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,720
Of course,
I wouldn't dream of going without you.

1015
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,220
My dear Sir Henry,
if you'd wanted us to come with you...

1016
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:14,420
...you'd have told us about the invitation
much sooner than this.

1017
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,530
I beg your pardon?

1018
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,860
You'd better be off. You mustn't be late
for your peasant friends.

1019
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:22,770
-I don't like that, Holmes. -I don't
like the people you're mixing with.

1020
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,470
I thought, in your new position,
you would've cultivated worthier friends.

1021
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,010
I hope you enjoy their rabbit pie.

1022
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:37,020
Mr. Holmes, I appreciate the fact
that you are here to help me.

1023
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,220
Nevertheless, I would remind you
that you are also a guest in my house.

1024
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:45,460
-Good night!
-Good night.

1025
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,160
-I do think you might...
-Do stop talking nonsense.

1026
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,260
You know my methods.

1027
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,340
Couldn't you see
I was being purposely rude?

1028
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,100
I wanted him to go without us.
The dagger's gone.

1029
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,300
Don't you realize what that means?
Sir Henry is to die tonight!

1030
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,900
Are you sure your leg is all right?

1031
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,440
It's got to be, if we're to break the curse
he laid on the Baskervilles.

1032
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,910
-Holmes?
-Yes.

1033
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,910
You learned something from that portrait
that I never saw.

1034
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:37,310
The hands, Watson.
Why do you think this painting was stolen?

1035
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:41,540
Because the artist revealed both hands.
Barrymore's confirmed what I suspected.

1036
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,680
The fingers of Sir Hugo's right hand
were webbed.

1037
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,580
-Stapleton.
-Exactly. Stapleton.

1038
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:51,680
Illegitimate descendent of Sir Hugo,
next in line to the Baskerville fortune.

1039
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:34,900
-No. This way.
-But this is the way to the farm.

1040
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,200
Come on.

1041
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,240
Swine!

1042
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,910
You thought it was going to be easy,
didn't you? Didn't you?

1043
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,380
You won't be the first
of your family who thought that...

1044
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:34,450
...and you won't be the first
to die because of it.

1045
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,290
Remember the legend?

1046
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,190
Sir Hugo died here.

1047
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,490
His throat was torn out because of a girl.

1048
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,130
And Sir Charles, your dear uncle,
he died here, didn't he?

1049
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,570
Died because he wanted me, like you.

1050
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:55,170
Died because he wanted a woman enough
to bring me here alone at night...

1051
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,040
...in spite of the hound
of the Baskervilles.

1052
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,310
He died screaming.

1053
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,890
I know. I watched him.

1054
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,090
And now you are here alone...

1055
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,850
...at night.

1056
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,150
You don't understand, do you?

1057
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,820
Then let me explain.

1058
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:17,130
I, too, am a Baskerville,
descended from Sir Hugo...

1059
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:21,760
...descended from those who died
in poverty while you scum ruled the moor.

1060
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,540
We have waited and prayed
for this moment, my father and I.

1061
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,540
Now our time has come, and yours.

1062
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:33,510
The curse of the hound is on you.

1063
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:55,560
No, Watson!
She won't get far. Attend to Sir Henry.

1064
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,100
All right.

1065
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,840
All right, Sir Henry.

1066
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,910
The hound is dead,
and you must see it, sir.

1067
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,840
No, I don't...

1068
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,700
It is best that you should.

1069
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,850
There is nothing to fear now.

1070
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:32,490
There's a passage leading from the mine
to this place.

1071
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,000
I discovered it after Stapleton
tried to kill me down there.

1072
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,380
They used this mask
to make it look more terrifying.

1073
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:48,050
He was starved for weeks,
kept in the mine till the time was ripe...

1074
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,950
...then given the scent.

1075
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:02,860
They had to have something of yours
to give the hound.

1076
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,630
We'd better get Sir Henry back
to Baskerville Hall.

1077
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,370
Have you got your cape?
Would you get it for me?

1078
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:34,860
-So the curse has claimed its last victim.
-Yes.

1079
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:38,000
No more will be heard
of the hound of the Baskervilles.

1080
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:46,740
I feel I have already suffered enough
from my infamous ancestor...

1081
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:48,070
...and so...

1082
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,270
"And so I am sending you
the missing portrait...

1083
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:54,540
"...which we found at Stapleton's farm
to add to your collection of souvenirs.

1084
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:58,450
"I hope you will accept it,
also the check which I enclose for..."

1085
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,550
Very generous.

1086
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:04,090
After tea, you must write to Sir Henry
that I should be pleased...

1087
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:06,130
...to accept both his gifts.

1088
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,560
Tell me, Holmes...

1089
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:13,900
...when did you first suspect the truth
about this case?

1090
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,870
-The truth?
-Yes, that the hound was a real dog...

1091
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,810
...and not just a legendary myth.

1092
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,440
When Sir Henry complained
of a missing boot...

1093
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,670
...that put me on the scent, as it were.

1094
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:27,980
As early as that.

1095
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,050
That's incredible.

1096
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:32,580
It's elementary, my dear Watson.

1097
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,190
A muffin?

1098
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,560
Thank you.

1099
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:48,560
