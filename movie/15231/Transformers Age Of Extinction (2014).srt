He's got orders to kill. I don't even think international laws apply up here.

如果这东西有任何重大的历史价值

太疯狂了
Crazy shit.

美国  德州

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,100
耶格研发中心

20
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,010
我是个脾气不好的女人
I'm a nasty woman

21
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,880
看这是谁来上班了
Oh, look who decided to show up for work.

22
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,820
踩碎一地芳心
I'm a heartbreaker

23
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,290
让你痛哭流涕
Gonna make you cry

24
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,760
怎么  南帕诸岛不适合冲浪吗
What, surf report no good at South Padre?

25
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
浪头不够高  车子又没油
The waves are flat and I got no gas.

26
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,930
你懂的  凯德
You know that, Cade.

27
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,370
哥们  真没礼貌

拜托你答应给我工资

31
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,910
卢卡斯  很多人有工作就知足了
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys are just happy to have a job at all.

32
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,580

33
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,910
-身上有现金吗  -有

我爷爷花了一辈子经营这里

38
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,030
对吧  爷爷
Ain't that right, granddaddy?

39
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,870
他很快就会把这转到我名下
Real soon he's going to sign it over to me.

40
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,540
都是现在的电影害的
The movies nowadays, that's the trouble.

41
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,910
不是续集就是重制  一堆垃圾
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.

42
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,310
我真喜欢那一部
I love that one.

43
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,880
他又老又聋
He's deaf and senile.

44
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,950
我听到了
Heard that.

45
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,750
这些只需要稍微整一整
Now these just need some spit and polish.

46
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,920
我想就能放数字电影  没准IMAX都行
I believe they're digital, possibly IMAX.

47
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,690

Yeah, they're not. Mister, we'll have a look around

48
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,950
我们可以自己看
if you want to leave us to it, okay?

49
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,620
以前人们不远千里来这儿
You know, folks used to come from miles around

50
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,390
看舞女跳恰恰舞

51
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,890
我发誓

52
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,960
他再让我给他换尿布  我就给他下毒
I am one diaper change away from poisoning his oatmeal.

53
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,530
你该坚持来这  老伙计
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.

54
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,730
既然你在这觉得自己更年轻
If coming here makes you feel young,

55
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,430
那就让他天天带你来
then you tell this kid to bring you here every day.

56
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,870
七块卖我  否则我就继续说下去
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

57

58
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,970
还记得小时候这里的样子吗
Remember this place when we were kids?

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,220
高中的时候你带几个姑娘来过这里
How many girls you think you brought here in high school?

60
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,950
我只记得一个
I only remember one.

61
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,950
小心头
Hey, heads!

62
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,480
难怪你进不了校队
That's why you didn't make the varsity team.

63
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,800
好  长传
All right. Go long.

64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,700
算了
Leave it.

65
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,930
迫击炮弹
Mortar shells?

66
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,430
你这是怎么了
What the hell happened to you?

67
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,440
哥们  这卡车多少钱
Hey, snakeballs. How much for the truck?

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,090
再两周  姐妹们  就再也不用上课了
Two more weeks, girls, till no more classes, ever.

70
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,690
马上就能晒个古铜色  喝个烂醉了
Almost time to get a tan and get wasted!

71
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,170
邻居们  把东西放在这
钱看着给吧
修理基金

72
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,960
邻居们  把东西放在这
钱看着给吧

73
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,060
拜托  拜托
Please, please.

74
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,990
没有助学金  真是棒极了

Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Back away from the premises!

77

- Voice recognition. It's me! - I am dialing 911.

78
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,710
随你的便  我无所谓
Go right ahead. I don't care.

79
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,520
我要打电话报警了
I'm still calling 911.

80
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,850
芝加哥一战
The battle of Chicago was an event

81
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,950
永久地改变了我们的世界

83
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,090

84
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,570
举报可疑的外星人活动
to report suspicious alien activity.

85
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,530
国会迅速终止了
A swift act of congress put an end to all joint operations

86
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,200
军方和汽车人的所有联合行动  终止了联盟
between the military and the autobots, ending the alliance.

87
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,900
各位委员都知道
As this committee knows,

88
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,070
五年前  芝加哥入侵事件那天
the invasion of Chicago was a defining day

89
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,510
是个决定性的日子
for our nation five years ago.

90
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,940
那一天  无数的人意识到
The day millions of people realized that

91

我们再也不能让外星人
never again can we allow aliens

92
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,850
为我们而战
to fight our battles for us.

93
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,850
在终止联合作战行动之后
A handful of autobots were given sanctuary

94
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,650
少部分的汽车人获得了安置

95
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,890
仅剩十数个霸天虎仍然在逃
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons are still on the run,

96
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,820
这都归功于我们中情局小队
thanks to our CIA unit,

97
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,760
"墓风"队
"Cemetery Wind."

98

至于外星人的科技

100
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,630
我们的目标是将其掌控在美国手中

101
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,630
我叫蒂莫西  这是我的小组成员
Hi. My name is Timothy. This is my crew.

We just found it in the rubble and it's all working...

104
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,640
有消息说日本  印度

105

以色列可能已经获得若干艘飞船

Apparently the Russians are starting a bidding war.

107
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,190
五千块我们就卖
We're taking $5,000 for it.

108
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,880
上面有36把枪  全是外星装备
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.

109
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,990
新时代已然开启
A new era has begun.

110

变形金刚的时代已经结束了
And the age of the transformers is over.

111
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,990
我一直在等你呢

今天你好性感
You're looking hot today!

113
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,890
是吗  那你把衬衣脱了吧
Oh, yeah? How about you taking your shirt off?

114
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,290
你要我现在就脱了吗
You want me to take my shirt off right now?

115
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,020
你爸看到会怎么想  你要去哪
What would your dad think about it? Hey, where you going?

116
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,750
简直不敢相信  太夸张了
I cannot believe him. I cannot believe this.

117
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,630
搞什么
What the hell?

118
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,170
继续开
All the way!

119
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,740
一辆卡车
A truck?

120
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,570
爸  别告诉我你把钱全砸这车上了
Dad, please tell me you didn't spend our money on this.

121
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
他没有  别担心  他花的是我的钱
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't. He spent my money.

122
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,240
一共150美元
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

123
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,280
就当透支一下你的固定工资吧
As an advance on your regular paycheck.

124
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,120
-什么固定工资  -以后会还给你的

- When? - Never. We're broke.

126
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,720
我就知道
I knew it.

127
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,190
宝贝  能不能请你别挑拨
Sweetheart, could you please not drive a wedge

128
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,820
老板和员工之间的关系
between employer and employee.

129
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,890
等等  我以为我们是合伙人的关系
Hold on. I thought we were partners.

130
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,390
我手头紧  还得给她买毕业舞会的礼服
Look, I came up short, okay? I had to buy her a prom dress.

131
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,060
你不希望我给她买毕业舞会的礼服吗
You want me to deny her a prom dress?

132
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,200
不买也行  反正你不让她带舞伴
You might as well. You denied her a prom date.

133
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
才没有  我会陪她一起去
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.

134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
谁想和自己老爸跳舞啊
Nobody wants to go to the dance with their dad.

135
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,370
太奇怪了
It's weird.

136
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,500
问题不在这
It's not the issue.

137
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,670
也许问题就出在这

Dad, please. You can't keep spending money on junk

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,870
你只是把一种废品变为另一种废品
just so you can turn it into different junk.

152
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,870
在这里没有东西是"废"的

Look, I fix that, it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250.

173
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,860
你要是摔得不重
If I would have been able to fix that

174
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,020
我把它修好了
before you broke it even more,

175
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,290
应该值20块

有些东西就不应该发明出来吗

184
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,340
没想过  那是思想倒退

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,230
别开枪
Hold your fire.

274
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,540
别  别开枪
Hold! Hold fire!

275
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,810
你们没看见吗  我已经受伤了
Can you not see? I've been injured.

276
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,740
围住他  围住他
Box him in. Box him in.

277
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,810
我是医疗官救护车  你们的盟友
Medical officer Ratchet! I'm a friend!

278
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,520
我是汽车人
I'm an Autobot!

279
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,550
那你为什么还要跑
Then why are you running?

280
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,390
擎天柱给我发了预警信息
Optimus sent this distress message.

281
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,160
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all autobots.

282
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,790
我们现在是攻击目标
We are under targeted attack.

283
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,660
停止与人类的所有联系
Cease all contact with humans.

284
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,090
我们都躲起来了
We're all hiding.

285
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,530
所有的汽车人都在逃亡
All autobots are being hunted.

286
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,570
危在旦夕
We're all in danger.

287
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,800
我妹妹在芝加哥遇难了
I lost a sister in Chicago.

288
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,170
别指望我同情你
You'll get no sympathy from me.

289
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,820
你们人类是怎么了
What's wrong with you humans?

290
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,470
不要  求你们了
No! Please.

291
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,040
暂停射击  暂停射击
Check fire, check fire!

292
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,750
我来处理他
He's mine now.

293
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,650
禁闭
Lockdown.

294
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,720
汽车人  霸天虎
Autobots, Decepticons.

295
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,330
就跟孩子一样  总是打个不停
Like little children, always fighting.

296
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,170
给这世界添乱
Making a mess out of the universe.

297
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,600
还要我出面替他们擦屁股
Then I've got to clean it up.

298
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,870
你想活命  只有一个办法
There is one way you survive.

299
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,770
告诉我他藏在哪
Tell me where he's hiding.

300
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,740
擎天柱在哪儿
Where is Optimus Prime?

301
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,740
休想
Never.

302
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,520
那你也休想活命了
Never is here.

303
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,670
我得说  你们的工作非常出色
I must say, it is remarkable,

304
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,370
在你接管部门之后
really astounding the success that the CIA has had

305
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,240
中情局取得了前所未有的成功
since you have taken operational control,

306
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,870
所以总统派我来请你
and so the president has asked me to ask you

307
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,180
还有他
to ask him,

308
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,310
邀请你们两个
to invite you both, uh,

309
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,710
到白宫坐一坐  聊一聊
over to the white house just to powwow,

310
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,450
给我们大概讲一下
where we get maybe some more specifics about how

311
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,520
你们是怎么追捕霸天虎的余党的
exactly you're hunting the enemy Decepticons left.

312
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
我干这行有两年了
I've had my desk for two years.

313
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,310
而艾丁格先生已经在这里工作了25年
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

314
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,330
我从来不询问他的工作细节
He runs the projects where I don't ask for specifics.

315
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,530
所以才叫黑色行动
That's why they're called black ops.

316
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,800
所以我们晚上才睡得着
And why we all sleep better at night.

317
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,600
了解了  这很好啊  那么
Check. That is great. So, um...

318
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,610
有什么猛料吗  进展的怎么样
Any dirt on that? Uh, how, uh, that's going?

319
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,480
非常顺利
Outstanding.

320
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,220
很好  太好了
Great. Oh, great.

321
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,850
等的就是这句  总统会很高兴的
I was hoping to hear that. The president will be pleased.

322
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,690
那个  我实话跟你们说
Cause, I'll tell you right now,

323
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,850
我这个幕僚长周一才刚上任
I've only been chief of staff since Monday,

324
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,990
但我对外星人打仗那些事儿还是挺了解的
um, but I do know that the alien war stuff,

325
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,360
他们  工作中就属他们最有趣了
these are... These are the only fun meetings.

326
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,430
你知道我的工作不是取悦总统
Look, I'm not here to entertain the president,

327
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,430
但是你可以告知他战争将会很快结束
but you may tell him that the war will be over soon.

328
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,000
很快结束  以防他问起
be over... In case he asks,

329
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,570
我需要明确记下你的答复
I just like to have an exact quote.

330
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,810
"战争将会很快结束"
"War will be over soon."

331
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,610
这很好啊  多好的消息
That is great. Such good news.

332
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,650
还有  总统期望
And, um, the president would, I know, just love...

333
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,010
非常非常期望
Really, really love

334
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,520
跟他碰面  其实不能叫碰面
to press the flesh... Not flesh, obviously,

335
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,820
就是跟他拍张照什么的
but just maybe get a shot with, um...

336
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,390
是天柱大人  天柱先生
Is it lord Prime? Sir Prime?

337
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,660
可以在空军一号上
We could bop on air force one.

338
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,560
就简单见个面  速战速决
It'd be just a quick bop, then we just bop in and bop back.

339
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,390
-别让总统抱太大希望  -好吧
- I wouldn't get his hopes up on that one. - Okay.

340
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,330
擎天柱
He's called Optimus Prime.

341
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,800
是外星战士  是违法的
Alien combatant. Here illegally.

342
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,270
他们不是我们的盟友吗  为什么违法
But aren't they our friends? Why?

343
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,340
因为只要他们一天不消失
Because our world will never truly be safe

344
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,380
我们的世界就不会真正的安全
till all of them are gone.

345
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,940
我还以为我们可以
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do

346
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,480
举行一个正式的告别仪式
a much more ceremonial farewell.

347
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
毕竟我们的军队
Especially since our military

348
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,550
曾与他们有过亲密合作
has worked so closely with them.

349
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,790
-但是你这样说  -这不是他们的星球
- Until you. - It's not their planet.

350
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,390
从来都不是
Never was.

351
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,620
该物归原主了
Time we take it back.

352
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,500
好了  来吧  加把劲儿
All right, come on. Come on.

353
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,810
很好  很好
Yes. Yes.

354
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,510
非常好
Yes.

355
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
你做到了
Oh, there you go.

356
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,780
别  把住啊
No, hold it.

357
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,780
别抖
Stop shaking!

358
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,750
为什么发抖啊  你又不用担心温饱
Why are you shaking? You have the job!

359
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,350
你忘记吃晚饭了
You forgot to eat dinner!

360
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,490
知道我为什么担心了吧
You see why I worry?

361
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,060
对不起  宝贝  我
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...

362
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,760
我差一点就成功了
I almost got it working right.

363
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,470
那个  我完成了作业也结束了期末考试
So, listen, I'm done with homework and set with finals,

364
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,700
所以我想跟朋友们开车出去玩儿会
so I was just gonna take a little drive with some friends

365
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,570
行吗
if that was okay with you.

366
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,670
不找男朋友  我知道  先毕业再说
No boys, I know. Graduate first.

367
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,040
那是
Exactly.

368
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,050
你知道就咱家有这条规矩吧
You do know no one else has this rule, right?

369
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,350
规矩  别说这么难听
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay.

370
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,420
这是智慧
It's wisdom.

371
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,650
而且也没必要开车出去玩儿
I don't think we need to be driving around

372
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,120
都7点45了  天快黑了
It's already like quarter to eight. It's almost dark.

373
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,620
斯帕德  你能消停会儿吗
Spud, will you stop it?

374
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,360
你知道我毕业的时候在干什么吗
You know where I was for my graduation?

375
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,100
知道  跟我这个错误在一起
Yes. With me, the mistake.

376
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,760
你是惊喜  泰莎  最美妙的事
The surprise, Tess. And the best thing that ever happened.

377
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,530
我们看起来不幸福吗
Do we look unhappy? Huh?

378
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,100
那是我这一生中最美好的一天
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

379
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,110
你妈妈去世之前我向她保证
I made your mother a promise before she passed.

380
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,410
我们的孩子一定会出席毕业典礼的
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation. That's it.

381
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,140
高中的小伙子什么都不懂
High school boys know nothing.

382
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,050
成熟之后才靠得住
It's only later they turn into men.

383
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,180
所以如果你那时更成熟更明智
So if you were older and wiser,

384
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,970
我就不会出生了
I wouldn't exist.

385
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,380
我不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

386
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,850
这是个不谈恋爱的家庭
You know, this is a non-dating household, okay?

387
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,450
你不恋爱  我也不恋爱  就是这样
You don't date, I don't date. That's it.

388
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
也许你真该去谈一场
Well, maybe you should.

389
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,890
泰莎  别走
Tessa, wait.

390
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,130
泰莎
Tessa?

391
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,060
听我说
Look.

392
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,970
我知道我太严格了  但是我必须这样做
I know I've been on you, okay? But I have to be.

393
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,000
大家都知道  12到17岁是危险期
Twelve to seventeen is the official teenage danger window.

394
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,170
陪你顺利度过这段时间是我的责任
It's my job to get you through it.

395
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,870
你想怎么生气都行
So you can be pissed off all you want.

396
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,110
好吧  你去跟朋友兜风吧
And, yes, you can take a ride with your friends.

397
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,120
好的
Okay.

398
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,520
别熬夜工作
Don't work all night.

399
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,050
记得吃饭
And eat.

400
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,640
生命中最美好的事  艾米丽
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.

401
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
她的出现是我生命中最美好的事
She's the best thing that ever happened.

402
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,610
你会为之骄傲的
You'd be proud.

403
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,690
哦  不
Oh, no.

404
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,630
难以置信
Unbelievable.

405
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,630
简直难以置信  老天
Unbelievable. God!

406
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,060
这里面总得有什么东西能补贴下家用
Something in here needs to make this family some money.

407
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,780
来吧  你这老古董
Come on, you old wreck.

408
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,050
审判日到了
Judgment day.

409
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,830
他人呢
Where is he?

410
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,160
我不知道
I don't know.

411
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,730
发现入侵者  发现入侵者
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

412
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,000
混蛋
Asshole.

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,570
我要报警了
I am dialing 911.

414
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,910
泰莎  我算是你叔叔了
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.

415
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,680
你家就是我家
Su casa es mi casa.

416
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,000
我们要失去这个家了
And we're going to lose the casa.

417
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,850
爸爸
Dad!

418
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,010
来了
Coming!

419
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,920
你在折腾激光吗  是的话我就不进来了
Are you working with lasers? If so, I'm not coming in.

420
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,120
你们绝对没见过这样的卡车
You guys have never seen a truck like this before.

421
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,720
快进来  锁上门
Get in here. Lock that door.

422
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,290
这门连锁都没有
It doesn't have a lock.

423
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,630
快看这个散热器上的洞  看看这个大小
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator. Look at the size of it.

424
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,760
有东西在这上面炸了个洞
Something blew a hole in it!

425
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,060
是又如何
Yeah, so?

426
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,530
这不是一般的钢
It's not normal steel.

427
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,930
引擎里面有块弹片
The shrapnel in the engine,

428
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,600
阻断了所有的线路连接
it ripped all the connections apart.

429
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,940
瞧这个  只有我这么聪明的人才能想到
And watch. And this took some Cade genius.

430
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,140
你们肯定会喜欢这个
You are gonna love this.

431
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,010
我把这个和工作电源连通的时候
When I hook this back to a working battery...

432
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,850
呼叫...
Calling all...

433
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,250
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all autobots.

434
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,320
没错
Oh, yeah.

435
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,750
我觉得这根本就不是辆卡车
I don't think it's a truck at all.

436
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,190
我想我们刚找到了个变形金刚
I think we just found a Transformer.

437
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,190
变形...
Tran... ugh!

438
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,020
-紧急撤离  -等等  伙计们
- Evacuate! - Wait! Guys!

439
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,130
爸爸  你疯了吗
Dad, are you out of your mind?

440
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,830
你不能把这东西留在这
You need to get that thing out of here.

441
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,830
别担心  我在里面干了一晚活都没事
You don't have to worry. I've been in there working all night, I'm fine.

442
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,600
那不是辆卡车  好吗  你说得对
You know what? That's not a truck, okay? You're right.

443
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
那是个外星杀人机器
It's an alien killing machine.

444
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,700
哥们  车都报废了
Dude. It's DOA. Jesus.

445
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,270
彻彻底底地报废了
It's been recalled, totaled, done.

446
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,100
听着  你该打那个电话
So, listen, there's a number that you call.

447
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,840
你应该要打给政府
You're supposed to call the government.

448
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,580
现在美国人都这么干
It's the American thing to do.

449
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,080
好了  你打了电话
Here we go. You're supposed to call,

450
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,610
如果真的是外星人
and if it ends up being alien,

451
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,980
你就能赢得两万五千美金
then you win $25,000.

452
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,250
这赢不了钱的
You don't win money.

453
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,650
如果抓到活的
And if you can capture it live...

454
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,080
就像抓瞪羚一样
like tag it like a wild wildebeest,

455
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,820
那你就能拿到十万美金
then you get $100,000.

456
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,360
爸爸  我们快去打电话
Dad, we are making the call.

457
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,270
-我是这么听说的  -我看过那个广告
- I heard that. - I've seen the commercial.

458
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,970
他们没这么说  没有保证
They don't say that. That's not a guarantee.
-我是这么听说的  -我看过那个广告
- I heard that. - I've seen the commercial.

459
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,820
他们没这么说  没有保证
They don't say that. That's not a guarantee.

460
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,660
你觉得格雷格会骗我吗
You think Greg would lie to me?

461
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,330
如果那真是芝加哥战役里的变形金刚
Look, if that's a transformer there from the battle of Chicago,

462
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,260
我得知道他们是怎么运作的
I need to know how it works.

463
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,830
我是个发明家  这将是我的突破口
I'm an inventor. This could be a game changer for me!

464
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,770
如果我在我的发明上运用他们的技术
If I can apply that technology to my inventions,

465
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,130
这辈子都衣食无忧了
we'd never have to worry about money again.

466
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,370
你之前还不是这么说
I've heard that before.

467
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,100
两万五千美金啊  我的学费不愁了
Twenty-five grand! It pays for my college.

468
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,210
房子也不愁了
It pays for the house.

469
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,980
再说  你是花我的钱买的那辆卡车
Besides, you used my money to buy the truck, right?

470
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,110
所以理论上来说  那是我的卡车
So technically, that's my truck.

471
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,110
你说是不是
Don't you think?

472
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,250
你也签了合同
You also signed a contract

473
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,780
同意一切以研究室为首位
regarding all research lab I.P.

474
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,680
什么研究室  哥们  这就是个谷仓
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

475
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,990
你签的合同  你又想反悔了
You signed it and now you're competing.

476
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,860
你的所有点子都归我所有
Any idea of yours is mine.

477
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,990
你的任何想法都属于我
Any thought you have, I own it,

478
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,990
所以你人都是我的
so basically, I own you.

479
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,200
没什么人是谁的吧
I don't think you can own someone.

480
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,960
那是好多年前的事了  连德州都不兴这套了
That was, like, a while ago, even in Texas.

481
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,070
好了  把喷枪拿过来
All right. Bring the torch over

482
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,900
帮我扶一下轮臂
and help me with the pulley arm.

483
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,910
我觉得弹片废掉了动力源
I think the shrapnel took out its power core.

484
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,770
还有泰莎  看到了吗
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?

485
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,210
外星杀人机器会让我这么做吗
Would an alien killing machine let me do that?

486
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,150
电话我会打的
Look, I'll make the call.

487
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,650
我们会拿到钱  但先让我看看我是不是对的
We'll get the money. Just first let me see if I'm right.

488
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,690
你想躲房子里  躲着吧
You want to hide in the house? Go ahead.

489
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,690
好的
Okay.

490
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,790
开工了  轮臂
Let's go. Pulley arm.

491
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,260
简直不敢相信
I can't believe him!

492
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,130
那是什么  看着像颗导弹
What is that? Looks like a missile.

493
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,200
就是导弹
It is! Whoa!

494
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,280
爸爸
Dad!

495
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,780
客厅里有颗导弹
There's a missile in the family room!

496
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
我的...
Holy...

497
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,720
我要杀了你
I'll kill you!

498
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,260
不  不
No! No!

499
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,390
爸爸  有颗导弹...
Dad, there's a missile in...

500
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,240
我要杀了你  退后
I'll kill you! Stay back!

501
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,440
-别开枪  别开枪  -去报警  快跑
- Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! - Call 911! Run!

502
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,910
卢卡斯  停下
Lucas! Stop!

503
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,790
卢卡斯  别动  冷静下来
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

504
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,020
放松  人类
Easy, human.

505
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,860
在这待着  他不会伤到我们的
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us.

506
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,830
武器系统受损了
Weapons systems damaged.

507
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,900
有个导弹击中了你的引擎
A missile hit your engine.

508
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,740
我们帮你清出来了
And we took it out of you.

509
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,300
你伤得很重
You're hurt really bad.

510
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,810
我只是想帮你
I'm just trying to help you.

511
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,010
你现在在我家  我是个工程师
You're in my home now. I'm an engineer.

512
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,340
我叫凯德·耶格
My name is Cade Yeager.

513
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,210
凯德  我欠你个人情
Cade, I am in your debt.

514
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,020
我叫擎天柱
My name is Optimus Prime.

515
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,750
我的汽车人同胞们
My autobots.

516
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,020
他们的处境很危险
They're in danger.

517
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,760
我得走了  我现在得走了
I need to go. I need to go now.

518
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,130
你觉得你能撑多远
How far you think you're gonna get?

519
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,230
泰莎  过来  他需要我们帮助
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.

520
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,040
你怎么了
What happened to you?

521
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,910
人类设的埋伏  陷阱
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.

522
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,080
我逃了出来  变成了这样
I escaped and took this form.

523
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,240
但你是我们这边的
But you're on our side.

524
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,550
人类为什么要伤害你
Why would humans hurt you?

525
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,350
不是只有人类
They were not alone.

526
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,230
-我的汽车人可以修好我  -好
- My autobots can repair me. - Yeah.

527
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,130
要是你还能找到他们的话
If you can reach 'em.

528
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,100
我来修如何
What about me?

529
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,400
我警告你  地球的信使先生
I warn you, Mr. Messager of earth,

530
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,400
同盟就是合约  而合约
an alliance is a contract, and contracts,

531
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,900
就跟人类一样
like humans,

532
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
会有到期的一天
expire.

533
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,540
在这颗星球上  我们有句俗话
On this planet, we have a saying.

534
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,280
"敌人的敌人就是朋友"
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

535
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,910
我也有句俗话
I also have a saying.

536
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,610
"我不在乎"
"I don't care."

537
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,550
墨西哥市发生什么了
So what happened in Mexico city?

538
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,920
还以为你抓到他了
I thought you had him.

539
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,320
三处直接伤害  一处致命伤
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.

540
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,190
结果你们的人却让他跑了
Then your men allowed him to escape.

541
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,890
你答应给我的是人工智能
You promised me human intelligence.

542
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,030
或者只是句空话
Or is there such a thing?

543
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,460
你还没告诉过我
You know, you've still never told me.

544
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,330
你为什么要他
Why do you want him?

545
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,370
你替谁效力
Who are you working for?

546
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:22,240
我去过好多星系  每个物种都和你们一样
Every galaxy I've traveled, all you species are the same.

547
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,210
自以为是宇宙的中心
You all think you're the center of the universe.

548
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,950
真是太无知了
You have no idea.

549
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,550
去五金店  照着清单上买
Go to the hardware store and you get the list.

550
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,050
全买回来
The whole list.

551
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,120
你要试着修好他吗
What, you're going to try and fix him?

552
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,420
他可不是什么火车模型啊  凯德
He's not a model train set, Cade.

553
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,090
的确不是  但他很重要
No, that's right. He's important.

554
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,110
但他对谁重要
Yeah, but important to who.

555
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,290
你不能随便把个外星人关在谷仓里
You can't keep an alien locked up in your barn.

556
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:41,300
你要拿他干嘛  当玩具玩吗
What you gonna do? Play with him?

557
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,290
-你能冷静点吗  -我在尝试

你要拿他干嘛  当玩具玩吗
What you gonna do? Play with him?

558
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,060
-你能冷静点吗  -我在尝试
- Will you calm down? - I'm trying to,

559
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,200
但我刚被十尺高的大炮抵着头
but I just got hit in the head with a ten-foot Cannon!

560
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
他要是吃了你  那辆车归我
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

561
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,530
一个字也不能跟别人说  听到了吗
Not a word to anybody. Do you hear me?

562
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,670
一个字都不行
Not a single word.

563
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,900
谁都不行
Nobody.

00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,220

我们锁定了一个高级目标

特别行动小组已经准备就绪
Special operations group is ready.

567
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,890

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,950
特别行动组刚接到一个德州帕里斯的来电

570

太好了  去抓他
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.

571
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
你挨的这下好重啊
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

572
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,640
导弹差点打中你的动力源
The missile just missed your power source.

573
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,640
我们叫它火种
We call it a spark.

574
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
里面有我们的生命动力
It contains our life force

575
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,610
和所有的回忆
and our memories.

576
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,710
我们管这叫灵魂
Yeah, we call it a soul.

577
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,950
墓风队走吧
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

578
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,520
感谢你们的辛苦工作  女士们先生们

579
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,580
这间房间要转为机密运行了
This room is going dark.

580
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,090
出口在你们左边

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,310
你为什么愿意帮我
Why are you willing to help me?

586
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,650
大概是因为你相信我吧
I guess maybe because you trust me to.

587
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,370
我回来了
I'm back!

头上肿了那么大个包
I got a welt on my head

591
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
看着像在演《星际迷航》
that makes me look like a fricking Star Trek character.

592
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,670
随便吧
Whatever.

593
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,590

我们正在追踪一辆废弃卡车
My men and I are trying to track down an abandoned truck.

600
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,470
你这片地不错

601
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
可惜要卖掉了

602

谢谢  但我们不卖

603
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,350
你是说那辆卡车吗
That the truck you mean?

604
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,780
恐怕不是
Afraid not.

605
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,320
耶格先生  我们接到某人的电话
You know, Mr. Yeager, we received a call from someone

606
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,620
说到了这辆卡车
concerned about this truck.

607
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,120
麻烦了
Oh, no.

608
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
不是你吗
That wasn't you?

609
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,610
我唯一关心的
Thing I'm concerned about

610
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,240
是你未经允许出现在我的地盘上
is you being on my property without permissions.

611
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,900
我们有条规矩专门对付那些惹德州人的人
You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas.

612
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
而且我不知道你说的什么卡车
And I don't know what truck you're talking about.

613
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,330
就是害美国人丢掉性命的
The kind that cost American lives.

614
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,870
搜索这些房子

615
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,770
"搜索这些房子"是几个意思
What do you mean, "Search the property"?

616
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,340
你都没有搜查令
You don't have a warrant.

617
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,640
我这张脸就是搜查令
My face is my warrant.

618
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,840
等等  假如你们真的找到了一辆卡车
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck,

619
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,750

Open, open, open.

623
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,490
注意矮墙  注意矮墙
Short wall. Short wall.

624
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,260
五人已进入  五人已进入
Five in. Five in.

625
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,090
发现入侵者
Intruder alert!

626
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,530
退出此处所
Back away from the premises.

627
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,600
这他妈是什么
What the hell is that?

628
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,570
某个弱智发明的吧
Just some dumb inventor.

629
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,300
安全
Clear.

630

360. 720. Heads on a swivel.

633
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,290
走吧  这里没东西
Let's go. There's nothing here.

634
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,590
没有任何迹象  我们什么也没找到
There's no signs. We got nothing.

635
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,020
长官  我们在垃圾堆里
Sir, we have a live armed missile

636
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,990
发现了枚激活的导弹
in the trash.

637
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,030
激活的
Live?

638
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,300
我还亲手把它搬到垃圾堆里了
I carried that to the trash!

639
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,970
你和我说它是哑弹  老兄
You told me that was a dud, dude.

640
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,730
我有可能被炸死  是吧
I could be dead. Right?

641
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,100
听着
Look.

642
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,750
好吧  没错  我是找到了一辆卡车  行了吧
Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.

643
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,840
我把它拖回来是为了上面的零件
I towed it back for the parts.

644
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,680
我昨晚把它留在这儿  今早它就不见了
I left it here last night. This morning, it's gone.

645
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,560
离开的时间  去了哪里  我都不知道
When? Where? I don't know.

646
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,280
我对天发誓
I swear to God.

647
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,500
关于他  我知道的就这么多了

648
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,550
"他"
"Him."

649
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,550
他说的是"他"
He said, "Him."

650
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,190
他知道那狗娘养的是谁

651
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,420
耶格先生

652
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,580

655
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,360
拿下他们
Take them down.

656
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,260

657

放开我
Let me go!

658
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,170
他们不知道卡车的事  我知道
They don't know about the truck! I know!

659
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,170
快放开她
Just let her go.

660
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,180
什么样的人会背叛自己的血肉同胞
What kind of a man betrays his flesh-and-blood brethren

661
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,910
就为了一坨外星金属
for alien metal?

662
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,860
不要让我看见他
Get this guy out of my sight.

663
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,410
滚开
Get off!

664
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,840
放开她  他们不知道卡车的事
Let her go! They don't know about the truck.

665
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,410
好了  上好膛
All right! Load up!

-卢卡斯  是你打的电话  是不是  -搜索周边
- Lucas, you called, didn't you? - Search the perimeter!

667
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,020
不是我  这些可怕的人我一个也不认识
No! I don't know any of these scary guys.

668
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,020
天呐  你在虐待一个女人
Oh, God! You're manhandling a woman!

669
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,420
我要狠狠揍你一顿
I'll kick your ass!

670
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,720
放开她
Let her go!

爸爸
Daddy!

674
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,200
不行  你们不能带走我
No! You're not taking me anywhere!

675
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,390
我是美国公民
I'm an American!

676
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,520
放轻松  甜心
Easy, sweetheart.

677
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,300
好吧  好吧  好吧

679
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,480
行了  我错了
All right. I was wrong.

680
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,690
萨沃伊
Savoy.

681
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,620
利用他女儿
Use the girl.

682
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,840
天哪
Oh, my God!

683
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,950
现在  你有十秒钟
Now, you got ten seconds.

684
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,220
卡车在哪里
Where's the truck?

685
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,180
怎么  难道你们打算朝我女儿开枪吗
What, you're gonna shoot my little girl?

686
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,000
假如有必要的话
If I have to.

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,220
求求你们别杀我
Please don't shoot me.

688
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,330
我真的不知道  我知道的都说了
Look, I don't know. I told you everything that I know!

689
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,510
他走了  他离开了
He's gone. He left.

690
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,000
他之前就在谷仓里的  我对天发誓

696
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,300
我说的是实话  他之前就在里面的
I'm telling you the truth! He was in there!

趴下
Get down!

707
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,080
凯德  他们会杀掉你们的

708
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,550

714
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,680
那辆卡车  他们想要那辆卡车
It's the truck. They want the truck!

715
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,810
"他们是谁"  你又是谁
"Who are they?" Who are you,

716
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,060
你喊谁"宝贝"呢
and who are you calling "baby"?

717
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,980
我知道你们听见我说话了
I know you heard me.

718
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,430
-我是她男朋友  -他是我男朋友
- I'm her boyfriend! - He's my boyfriend!

719
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,920
什么
What?

720
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,520
你才不是她男朋友呢
You're not her boyfriend!

721
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,010
他的名字叫肖恩  是个车手  爸爸
His name's Shane and he drives, dad.

722
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,840
那些都是什么车啊
What kind of cars are those?

723
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,300
好吓人
They're so scary!

724
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
后面又来了一辆
There's another one coming up the back!

725
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,190
你得在玉米田里甩掉他们
You gotta try to lose them in the cornfield!

726
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,670
他们从后面追上来了  快开
He's coming up behind us! Go!

727
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,630

他们要包抄我们
They've got us cornered!

729
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,110
小心  小心  小心
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

730
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,420
耶格先生
Mr. Yeager,

731
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,120
我并不想在这种情况下见面的  明白吗
this is not how I wanted us to meet, okay?

732
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,630
我叫肖恩  我是个完完全全的...
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely...

733
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,700
我不想跟你说话  好好开车
And I am not talking to you! Drive the car!

734
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,060
小心  小心
Watch out! Watch out!

735
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,340
开几枪警告他们
Throw 'em some warning shots!

736
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,520
天啊  我居然能开这么好
Man, I don't know how I'm driving this good.

737
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,530
像是升了一级
It's like, today I've gone to a whole other level.

738
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,840
看路  集中注意力  别说话了
Road, focus! Stop talking!

739
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,860
肖恩  小心
Shane, look out!

740
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,830
其实主要是我的错  明白吗
This may be primarily my fault, okay.

741
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,270
他们说了会带支票过来的
They said they were gonna bring a check!

742
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,190
谁知道来的是敢死队
I didn't know they were gonna send a death squad!

743
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,610
抓紧了
Hang on!

744
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,880
冠军产生了
Hey, we got ourselves a winner!

745
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,020
唐赢得了第一名
Don's got it over here.

746
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,300
小心
Look out!

747
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,560
我们甩掉他们了
We lost them!

748
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,080
干得好  玉米田里来的陌生人
Good job, stranger from the cornfields!

749
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
那些吓人的车又回来了
The scary cars are back.

750
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,290
在工厂甩掉他们  肖恩
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

751
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,520
我还以为你会开车呢  快
I thought you knew how to drive this thing! Go!

752
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,860
我觉得钱是拿不到了
I don't think we're gonna get that money.

753
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,860
应该是拿不到了
Doesn't seem like it.

754
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,270
凯德
Cade!

755
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,690
引他们上楼
Take 'em upstairs!

756
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,830
我们到五楼甩掉他们
We're losing them on the fifth floor.

757
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,360
-玩那一招  肖恩  -你懂我
- Do that thing, Shane! - You know it.

758
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,320
你们什么意思  哪一招
What do you mean? What thing?

759
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,580
我们马上要干的事  可能会有点吓人
What we're about to do is gonna be kind of scary.

760
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,240
把你们的枪掏出来  杀了他们
Take out your guns and shoot them!

761
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,050
他们在朝我们开枪
They're shooting at us!

762
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,450
泰莎  抓住手刹[小弟弟]
Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick!

763
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,220
什么
What?

764
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,680
她的小手干这个最厉害了
She's got the best hands in the business.

765
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,530
准备好了吗  泰莎
Ready, Tess?

766
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,730
拉
Pull!

767
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,130
不不不  不要
No! No! No! No f-ing way!

768
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,680
泰莎  你别想出家门了
Tessa, you are so grounded!

769
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,880
该死  轮圈裂了
Shit! The rim's cracked.

770
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,860
擎天柱
Optimus.

771
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,350
来吧  快  快走
Come on, move! Move!

772
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,850
我的脚卡住了  等等  凯德
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!

773
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,060
卢卡斯
Lucas!

774
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,380
等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

775
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,130
卢卡斯
Lucas!

776
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,260
卢卡斯  它在你上面
Lucas, it's above you!

777
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,650
快跑

778
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,430
快来  上车  快走
Come on, get in, let's go!

779
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,210
你是不是特别想看我现在是什么脸色
I'll bet you wish you could see my face right now.

780
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,980
卢卡斯  要抛下他吗
Lucas, we just left him?

781
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,250
他死了
He's gone.

782
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,200
失去了朋友节哀吧
My deepest sympathies for the loss of your friend.

783
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,540
别动  我看有没有人跟踪
Stay here till I'm sure we weren't followed.

784
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,110
我们都是目标了
We are all targets now.

785
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,420
所以现在我们就躲着吗  这就是计划吗
So we're hiding out now? That's the plan?

786
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,390
难道我们要听一个卡车的命令吗
We're taking orders from a truck?

787
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,990
你有什么更好的主意吗
Well, you got a better idea?

788
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,090
离她远点  小子  不要...
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't...

789
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,500
别碰她  明白吗  不准
Keep your hands off her. All right? No.

790
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,300
你被德州的一个车库发明家狠揍了一顿
You got your ass kicked by a garage inventor from Texas.

791
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,530
会在你简历上记上这一笔的
That goes on your resume.

792
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,040
没错  你们所有人都是
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too!

793
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,280
你觉得我有心情听你废话吗
Do I look like I'm in the mood for any of your shit today?

794
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,980
华盛顿方面以为我们在追霸天虎
Washington thinks we were chasing a decepticon target,

795
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,210
但是不找到耶格
but our story falls apart

796
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,910
故事就穿帮了
if we don't find this Yeager family first.

797
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,880
是啊  假如他去找警察或者联调局呢
Yeah, well, what if he goes to the cops or the FBI?

798
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,960
他们知道要把他交过来的
They know to hand him over.

799
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,850
他的生活已经没得过了
His world as he knows it is gone.

800
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,930
往好的一方面想  你俩总算见面了
Well, bright side, you guys met.

801
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,430
他是哪里人
Where is he from?

802
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,100
我告诉过你了  他是德州的一个车手
I told you, he's a driver from Texas.

803
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,100
德州
Texas?

804
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
德州都柏林  德州三叶草吗
Where, Dublin, Texas? Shamrock, Texas?

805
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,070
他怎么一股爱尔兰味
So why does he sound like a Leprechaun?

806
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,510
在爱尔兰说这话的话你会被狠揍一顿的
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that.

807
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,740
我们不在爱尔兰  小可爱  在德州
Well, we're not in Ireland, lucky charms. We're in Texas.

808
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:08,420
他是车手
And so he drives?

809
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,380
这是什么意思  他是开车的
What do you mean, he drives?

810
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,210
是说  他靠这个为生
Like, for a living?

811
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:10,780
是的
Yeah.

812
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,960
至少他能养活自己
At least he makes a living.

813
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,350
谢谢
Thank you.

814
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,590
听着  我参加拉力赛
Look, I race rally cars.

815
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,590
一个车手
One driver.

816
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,630
一个领航员
One navigator.

817
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,490
她
Her.

818
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,430
顺便一说  我是完全合法的
By the way, I'm totally legit.

819
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,160
我刚刚被红牛车队选上了
I just got picked up by red bull.

820
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,680
还有告诉您一声
And just so you know,

821
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,900
我的全部家当都在那辆车上了
my life savings was in that car back there.

822
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,040
这不可能
This is not happening.

823
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,160
绝对可能
Oh, it definitely is.

824
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,150
你多大了
How old are you?

825
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,380
20.

826
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,580
她才17岁
She's a 17-year-old girl.

827
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,420
这事只有两个解决办法
So we can work this two ways.

828
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,290
一   我给你一拳
One, I punch you right in the mouth

829
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,490
你报警抓我
and you call the police on me.

830
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,490
-爸  -或者二
- Dad. - Or two,

831
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,960
我直接报警抓你
I just call the cops on you

832
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,530
因为这是违法的  她是未成年人
because this is illegal. She's a minor.

833
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,530
我们是受罗密欧与茱丽叶法保护的
We're protected by the Romeo and Juliet laws.

834
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,060
我们交往的时间很长了
We dated for a little while

835
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,500
-我二年级他四年级  没事的  -当然有事
- I was a sophomore, and he was a senior. It's fine.  - No, it's not fine.

836
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,040
我们是青少年  正在相恋
We've got a preexisting juvenile foundational relationship.

837
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,670
-条令第22章011条  -什么
- Statute 22.011. - What?

838
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,340
德州法律吗
Texas statute?

839
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,540
-真有这么一条吗  -是的
- That a real law? - Yep.

840
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,280
罗密欧和茱丽叶是吗
Romeo and Juliet, huh?

841
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:17,680
你知道她们俩的结局吗
You know how those two ended up?

842
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,280
相爱了
In love.

843
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,220
死掉了  你父母知道这事吗
Dead. Do your parents know about this?

844
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,460
你父亲同意你和17岁的姑娘恋爱吗
Is your dad okay with you dating a 17-year-old girl?

845
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,960
我5岁的时候他走了
He took off when I was five,

846
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,600
再遇到他我会问问的
but if I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.

847
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,530
知道吗  泰莎
You know, Tessa,

848
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,000
-我本来很放心你的  -放心我什么
- I trusted you. - To what?

849
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,500
从来不玩不冒险
Never have fun, take a risk,

850
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,070
和你一样当个乖宝宝吗
be a normal teenager, like you?

851
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,440
而且我一直在竭力照顾你
And I have been busting my ass to take care of you.

852
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,640
你把那卡车带回家时
Is that what you were doing

853
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,510
有为我着想吗
when you brought home the truck?

854
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,740
本来你只要报警就行
All you had to do was report it,

855
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,680
现在可好  卢卡斯为此而死了
and now Lucas is dead.

856
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,010
我的人生也完了  谢谢你了
And my life is over. Thank you.

857
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,340
你把我照顾的真好
You've taken real good care of me.

858
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,100
求求你不要开枪
Please don't shoot me!

859
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,330
求你  爸爸
Please! Dad!

860
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,500
他们当时真打算杀了她
They were willing to kill her.

861
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,000
现在也是这么打算的
Then they still are.

862
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,040
是某人在某处下的命令
Somebody somewhere gave that order.

863
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,440
我要找到他的蛛丝马迹
I'm going to find some fingerprints.

864
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,970
请不要这样
Please!

865
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,180
不要
No!

866
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,520
我是汽车人  我是汽车人
I'm an autobot! I'm an autobot!

867
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,260
带上所有觉得有用的东西
Grab whatever you think we can use for supplies.

868
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,030
衣服什么的  还有那台电脑
Clothes, anything. And take that computer.

869
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,600
我们出发
Let's go.

870
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,140
这不太容易
This is not easy.

871
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,140
你也不是一无是处  爸
You know, you don't suck at everything, dad.

872
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,780
什么啊
What the...

873
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,120
我就知道
I knew it.

874
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,600
你跟我说他只是个小人物
You told me he was no one.

875
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,200
现在
Well,

876
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,600
这小人物有了我们的技术
this "No one" Has our tech.

877
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,760
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all autobots.

878
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,700
呼叫所有汽车人
Calling all autobots.

879
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,330
哇哦  我的神啊
Whoa! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

880
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:24,570
这太疯狂了
That was insane!

881
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,170
很酷但是很疯狂  对吧
It was awesome, but it was insane, right?

882
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,450
耶  太棒啦
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

883
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,350
他回来了  他还活着
He's back! He's alive!

884
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:46,360
擎天柱来了
Optimus is here!

885
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,670
终于  终于还是有希望了
At last. There is hope after all.

886
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,420
耶
Yeah.

887
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,600
自由星系的领袖回来啦
Mr. Leader of the free galaxy is back.

888
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,900
我就知道你没事  我从没质疑过
I knew you'd make it. I never doubted.

889
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,400
我们收到了你的警告  一直在等待
We got your warning. We've been waiting.

890
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,440
说的没错  开打吧
Hell, yeah. Boom time.

891
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,940
我们又重聚啦
We got the gang back together.

892
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,930
人类要求我们服从他们的规矩
Humans have asked us to play by their rules.

893
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:02,270
现在规矩变了
Well, the rules have just changed.

894
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,540
人类都是背后捅刀子的小人
Human beings, bunch of backstabbin' weasels.

895
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,670
猎狗  寻找你自己的心海罗盘
Hound, find your inner compass.

896
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,840
忠诚为何物
Loyalty is but a flower

897
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,240
恐惧诱惑之风中  柔柔一朵花
in the winds of fear and temptation.

898
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,680
你说什么乱七八糟的呢
What the hell are you saying?

899
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,410
-这叫俳句  -被废话了
- It's a haiku. - Cut the crap,

900
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,980
要不我就给你喂颗手榴弹
before I drop a grenade down your throat.

901
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,650
试试看  你会付出生命的代价
Try it, you'll be dead.

902
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,320
我求你动手吧  动手吧
Oh, please pull it. Please do it.

903
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,020
那倒给我们省事了
You know what, it'll save us so much time.

904
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,860
觉得
Well, raise your hand

905
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,920
愉快的地球之旅
if you're thoroughly disenchanted

906
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,760
该结束的请举手
with our little pleasant earth vacation.

907
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,000
这偷偷摸摸的是谁啊
So, who's the stowaways?

908
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,700
干嘛呀  别举枪嘛
Oh, whoa, hey, what's with the gun?

909
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,470
住手  猎狗  你也住手
Stop. Hound, both of you.

910
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,470
他们为了救我冒了生命危险
They've risked their lives for mine.

911
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,740
我们欠他们的
We owe them.

912
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,410
没有其他人了吗
So, there's been no sign of any others?

913
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,780
没  就剩我们了
Nada. We are all that's left.

914
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,810
他们正在把我们逐个击破
They're picking us off, one by one.

915
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,950
我们是可悲的落魄四人组
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome.

916
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,050
加你是五人组了
And you make five.

917
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,750
最好就只能到这步吗
So that's our best-case scenario?

918
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,390
汽车人证人保护措施
Autobot Witness Protection?

919
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,660
飚车的
Hey, speed racer,

920
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,830
你想走就直接走
you're welcome to leave anytime.

921
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,300
我说明一下  超级老爸
Well, for the record, superdad,

922
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,930
不是你罩着我
I'm not hiding with you.

923
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,930
是这个大家伙哎
I'm hiding out with that big guy.

924
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,570
先生  您下落不明时
Sensei, with your fate unknown,

925
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,740
大黄蜂暂时担任了领队
Bumblebee has held command,

926
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,740
虽然他完全没有一点
despite his complete and total lack of anything

927
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,340
武士的纪律
resembling warrior discipline.

928
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,480
他简直像个孩子
He's like a child.

929
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,710
这孩子打算揍你一顿
This child is about to kick your ass.

930
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,980
他简直给我们丢脸
He brings us shame.

931
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,680
综合格斗
Cage fight.

932
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,550
自作聪明
Smartass.

933
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,670
他们怎么回事
What's the matter with them?

934
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,490
难道只有我看透了
Am I the lone sage who sees through

935
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,090
他这卖萌的眼神吗  和你很不搭
this puppy-dog eyes act? It's beneath you.

936
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,590
太好了  我一直等他们
Yes, I've been waiting

937
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,400
打个两败俱伤
for them all to dispatch each other,

938
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,330
这样我就能顺利当上老大了
so I could take charge with no trouble at all.

939
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:43,400
独自一人来去自由
Just me reporting to me.

940
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,000
看来你当老大最好呢
Well, it sure looks like you've been missed.

941
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,640
汽车人  禁闭在追捕我们
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us

942
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,010
而人类在帮他
and humans are helping.

943
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,740
我们得搞清楚为什么
We need to know why.

944
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,780
听着  我虽然不知道原因
Well, listen, I don't know why,

945
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,950
但我知道这事是谁干的
but I have an idea about who.

946
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,120
我偷来的这个无人机有段突袭汽车人的视频
This drone I stole recorded footage of an autobot raid.

947
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,460
断断续续的  但是能看出发生了什么事
It's in pieces, but watch what happens here.

948
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,990
那是铅足
Oh, that's Leadfoot.

949
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,100
他们扯碎了他
They rip him apart.

950
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,600
太野蛮
Savages.

951
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,100
稍后  一辆车来拖走了他
And later, this truck comes to haul him off.

952
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,930
KSI  智能解决方案
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

953
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,370
搞国防宇航的  和政府签约
Defense, aerospace, government contracts.

954
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,470
是他们设计了这架无人机
They designed this drone.

955
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,810
就是说是政府的人在追捕你们
So these government guys just hunt you down,

956
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,130
然后再把你们交给这个KSI
and then pass you off to this KSI?

957
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,410
这个公司的总部在芝加哥
The company is headquartered in Chicago.

958
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,950
他们可能就是被带去那里了
That could be where they were taken.

959
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,150
要进去恐怕免不了战斗
No way to get inside without a battle.

960
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,720
有人类帮忙也许可以
Well, what if you had some human help?

961
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,020
你俩现在是伙伴了吗
What, are you two partners now?

962
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,620
宝贝  知道原因才能赢回我们的生活
Sweety, we need to know why or we'll never get our lives back.

963
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,730
汽车人们  我曾起誓绝不杀人
Autobots, I have sworn to never kill humans.

964
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,430
绝对是个错误
Big mistake.

965
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,030
但如果让我抓住幕后黑手
But when I find out who's behind this,

966
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,570
我一定会杀了他
he's going to die.

967
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,020
现在外面正全力搜捕我们
There's a full-on manhunt out for us,

968
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,890
所以我们得定几条新规矩
so we have some new rules.

969
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,120
所有警方的人都是敌人
Anyone who has got a badge is not our friend.

970
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,120
我们要分头进攻
We're gonna divide and conquer.

971
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,530
你俩就负责偷取食物和必需品
You two in charge of stealing food and the essentials.

972
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,630
其他的不要参与
And nothing else.

973
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,170
芝加哥KSI总部坚如堡垒
Chicago KSI headquarters is like a fortress.

974
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,570
我会想办法溜进他们的军事最高机密区
I'm gonna find a way into their top-secret military wing.

975
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,910
看有没有他们和政府的把柄
Find something to blackmail this company and the government.

976
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,510
我们要赢回自由
We're gonna get our freedom back.

977
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,190
早上好  乔伊斯先生
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

978
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,590
那是什么声音
What was that sound?

979
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,700
那正是
That's "The" Sound.

980
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,700
您要的声音
That you asked for.

981
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,670
不  我要求的是无限感  至高无上感
No, I asked for boundless. Transcendent.

982
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,040
当你穿过这栋楼的门
When you walk through a door in this building,

983
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,080
要有种踏进了未来的感觉
it should sound like you've stepped into the future.

984
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,850
这是现在
Present.

985
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,950
大声说
Say it.

986
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,120
这是未来
Future.

987
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,720
过去已然是历史  现在也正在过去
The past is history. The present is past.

988
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,690
而当下属于未来
The future is now.

989
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,230
我为什么联系不到你
Why can't I get in touch with you?

990
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
你难道没意识到北极的发现意味着什么吗
Don't you realize what the arctic find means?

991
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,600
你知道我们小时候都听过的
You know that story we were all told as children

992
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,010
上百万年前一个巨大的小行星撞击地球
about a giant asteroid that struck the earth

993
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,970
才导致恐龙灭绝的故事吧
millions of years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs?

994
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,140
好像知道
Vaguely.

995
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,980
我们错了
We were wrong.

996
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,780
这机械才是它们灭绝的原因
This metal caused the great extinction.

997
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,720
过程和方式我还不能确定
How and why, I can't yet say.

998
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,710
碳14测定它的年代大约在
But carbon dating puts it at

999
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,090
公元前六千五百万年
65 million years B.C.

1000
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,950
你让我们挖掘的这个矿石
This ore you've got us digging for

1001
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,950
比你以为的要危险的多
is a lot more dangerous than you think.

1002
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,890
而且我的人
And my people...

1003
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,720
达西
Darcy,

1004
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,050
我看只是你不太了解状况
I think that you've been out in the field for far too long.

1005
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,060
恐龙的事不如放在晚餐时讨论吧
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs over dinner?

1006
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,000
-吃肋排去  -没戏
- Ribs? - Not a chance.

1007
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,640
你根本不了解状况
You have no idea what's been happening here.

1008
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,710
我们马上就要飞跃了
We're about to make the quantum leap.

1009
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,610
一种稀土金属
A rare-earth metal.

1010
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,780
分子组成极不稳定
Molecularly unstable.

1011
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,150
工业用途为零
Industrial uses, none.

1012
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
接着外星人来到了地球
And then the aliens came.

1013
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,800
我们才发现了其间的联系
And we made the connection.

1014
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,620
他们正是由它组成的
It's what they're made of.

1015
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,760
这就是我们的圣杯
It's the holy grail.

1016
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,860
变形元素  我们起的名字
"Transformium." That's what we're calling it.

1017
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,260
贴切顺口
Focus-grouped. Catchy.

1018
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,230
注册商标吧
Trademarked.

1019
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,300
这是核裂变之后
This is the greatest advance in modern physics

1020
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,040
现代物理学最大的发现
since the splitting of the atom.

1021
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,740
这是可编程物质
It's programmable matter.

1022
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,110
现在我们绘制出了它的基因组
And now, we've mapped its genome.

1023
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,740
-是我  -你绘制出了它的基因组
- I. - Now you've mapped its genome.

1024
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,010
现在我们就可以开始
And now we can begin to give it

1025
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,150
给它指令了
instructions.

1026
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,650
这个相当不错
This is extremely good.

1027
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,020
瞧这个
Watch this.

1028
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,640
可以变成任何东西
We can change anything into anything.

1029
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:17,310
好感性的金属  不是吗
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?

1030
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,080
你喜欢音乐吗
Do you like music?

1031
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,280
胶囊音箱
The pill.

1032
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,690
或者是更暴力点的
Perhaps something a little more violent?

1033
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,660
老天  你做到了
Oh, my God. You've done it.

1034
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,370
在航空宇宙中  军队里
In aerospace, the military...

1035
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,130
我们将拥有整个机器人市场
We will own the entire robotics industry.

1036
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,970
所有的探究
All exploration.

1037
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,710
海洋  宇宙  一切
The oceans. Space. Everything.

1038
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,380
温布利  这是什么
Wembley. What is this?

1039
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,050
是你要的那个水母广告
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.

1040
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,410
你说他们充满肉欲
You said they were

1041
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,020
却又危险  就像女人一样
erotic yet deadly, like women.

1042
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,850
我没说过这种话
I never said that.

1043
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,420
-你说了  -我没说
- Yes, you did. - No, I didn't.

1044
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,850
你肯定说了  你当时在讲你前女友
I definitely heard you said 'cause you were talking about your ex-girlfriend,

1045
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,920
说她很性感  但是个贱人
who was sexy, but a bitch.

1046
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,360
参观期间不要吃东西
Please don't eat on the tour.

1047
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,260
是她吗
Is that her?

1048
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,170
我找到几箱衣服
Hey, I found a whole bunch of boxes of clothes.

1049
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,310
亲爱的  你来拿几条长裤吧
So, sweetie, you can get some long pants,

1050
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,000
那种宽宽松松的长裤
nice, loose-fitting ones,

1051
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,170
把你这些短到不行的短裤扔掉
and lose the short shorts, okay?

1052
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:21,170
你们搞到了什么
What'd you guys get?

1053
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,080
是蛋白质粉
It's protein.

1054
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,110
我说了只拿必需品
Look, I said the essentials, okay?

1055
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,350
说得容易  我们差点被抓
It wasn't easy. We almost got caught.

1056
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,280
你偷了瓶漱口水
You stole mouthwash?

1057
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,520
我跟你女儿亲热的时候得保持口气清新
I like to be fresh when I'm making out with your daughter.

1058
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,220
好好笑
That's funny.

1059
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,760
这辈子都不可能
Yeah, that's not happening ever.

1060
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,000
这辈子吗
Ever?

1061
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
只是我们的军方模型机  惊破天
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.

1062
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:50,870
我不懂了
I don't understand it.

1063
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,240
这已经是第五次尝试了
This is the fifth iteration.

1064
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,760
他怎么还是这种鬼样子
Why does he keep turning out like this?

1065
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,370
只是最后润色上有点问题
It's just some bugs in the final render.

1066
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,780
我是按擎天柱设计的惊破天
I modeled Galvatron after Optimus Prime.

1067
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,480
为什么总是像威震天
Why does he keep looking like Megatron?

1068
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,480
润色步骤即将结束  做好准备
Rendering sequence is almost finished. Stand by.

1069
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,050
那么简单的编程
Simple coding.

1070
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,260
算法
Algorithms!

1071
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,130
还有数学
Math!

1072
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:18,300
为什么总不能按照构想
Why can't we make what we want to make,

1073
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,860
造出我们想要的
the way we want to make it?

1074
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,400
为什么
Why?

1075
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,210
哪个顾客愿意买这张苦瓜脸
And does that look like a consumer-friendly face to you?

1076
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,410
胸前那个大洞是怎么回事
And what about that big hole in the chest?

1077
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,280
看着挺牛逼  我喜欢
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

1078
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,350
-相当喜欢  -我不喜欢
- Love it. - Well, I hate it.

1079
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,490
他来了
Oh, here he is.

1080
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,020
光头弗兰肯斯坦博士
That bald-headed Dr Frankenstein.

1081
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,160
女士  这都是违法的
Ma'am, this is not legal.

1082
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,020
这是非法实验
This is illegal experimentation.

1083
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,090
外星人永远不会这么对人类
Aliens would never do this to people!

1084
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,930
可能会吃了你或杀了你  仅此而已
Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it.

1085
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,530
这不对  没人能把我关在盒子里
This ain't right! Nobody puts baby in a box!!

1086
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,000
比水刑还糟糕
This is worse than waterboarding!

1087
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,100
这位小兄弟在为我们翻译
This little gentleman has been translating for us

1088
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,770
从这两个脑袋里提取出的信息
all the information that comes from these two heads.

1089
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,340
他们的历史  科技  所有的一切
Their history, their science, everything.

1090
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,980
-这是威震天吗  -正是
- Is that Megatron? - Precisely.

1091
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,850
你从哪找到的
Where did you get all this?

1092
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,780
特别政府合同
Special government contract.

1093
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:14,790
现在我们知道了关于变形金刚的一切
Now we know everything about Transformers.

1094
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,350
我们终于能自己建造了
And now at long last we can build them ourselves.

1095
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,990
可以造的比他们还好
And we can build them better.

1096
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:42,550
很好  大黄蜂  这样就能混进去了
Yeah, that's good, Bee. That'll get us in.

1097
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,690
每天都会运几趟货物
Couple times a day these guys move in vehicle shipments

1098
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:53,060
到KSI里进行扫描
into KSI for something called "Scanning."

1099
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,490
到处都是最高警备
Major security all over.

1100
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,820
我们的最好机会
Our best shot of getting in

1101
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,300
是从后面的机密研究室入口进去
is a back classified research entrance.

1102
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,140
我明天和大黄蜂一起去
I'm gonna drive in with bee tomorrow morning.

1103
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,240
不好意思
Excuse me.

1104
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,540
不许在我面前腻歪
There's no smooching in front of me, okay?

1105
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,610
你也太古板了  现在谁还说"腻歪"
You're so square. Who even says "Smooching"?

1106
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,840
一点都不尊重人
I tell you, no respect.

1107
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,440
有的时候太难沟通了
It's just impossible sometimes.

1108
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,050
我跟大黄蜂也经常这样
Yeah. I went through that with Bumblebee.

1109
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,990
冷静下来  冷静下来
Calm down. Calm down.

1110
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,460
现在这种时候
You know, at a time like this,

1111
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,160
现在是要保持冷静  不是耍帅装酷
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,

1112
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,480
干嘛不把墨镜摘了
so why don't you lose the glasses?

1113
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,600
大概一个月前
About a month ago,

1114
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,570
深更半夜的时候我听到家里有动静
middle of the night, I thought I heard noises in my house.

1115
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,100
是你吗
Was that you?

1116
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,240
什么  绝对不可能
What? Come on. No way.

1117
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,040
别对我撒谎  小子
Don't lie to me, kid.

1118
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,640
你看到那边那个拿枪的人了吗
You see that guy with the gun out there?

1119
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,940
这里都是拿枪的
There's so many guys with guns.

1120
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,010
我们要闯进去都是你的主意
We're about to break in and it's your idea,

1121
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,280
我可不在乎
'cause I don't care.

1122
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,310
我老了  活够久了
I'm old, I've already lived long enough.

1123
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,520
你现在说这些真不是时候  老兄
You are really bad of having these conversations at the wrong time, man.

1124
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,220
你想息事宁人  还是想让我大闹一场
You want to come clean or you want me to make a mess?

1125
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,520
先生  我能跟你谈一下吗
Sir, can I talk to you for a second, please?

1126
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,200
是我  是我
It was me, it was me, it was me, it was me.

1127
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,030
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1128
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,670
是去扫描的吗
Taking it in for scanning?

1129
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,430
好了  可以走了
All right. You're good to go.

1130
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,170
我真的会杀了你
I'm literally gonna kill you.

1131
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,500
在三号港扫描
Scanning in bay three.

1132
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,010
我们将陈旧的外星科技
We took old, alien technology

1133
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,340
全方位的加以改善
and made it better in every way.

1134
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,910
隆重推出刺叮
Introducing Stinger.

1135
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:26,050
KSI  我们创造世界
KSI. We make the world.

1136
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,450
那个机器人好牛逼
That is a bad-ass robot.

1137
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,660
看着有点像你啊  大黄蜂
He kind of looks like you, bee.

1138
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,430
这里是过去  现在是未来
Here is the past. And now the future.

1139
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,190
他们在自己造变形金刚
They're trying to build their own versions.

1140
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,400
好吧  至少他们选的颜色更酷
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars than this.

1141
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,330
你敢这么跟我说话
You talk to me like that?

1142
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,640
大黄蜂  停下
Bee, stop!

1143
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,540
知道自作聪明的下场了吧
You see what happens from being a wiseass?

1144
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,370
给我下去
Now get out of here.

1145
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,010
刺叮  灵感源于大黄蜂
Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee...

1146
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,540
但是更加尽善尽美
...but better in every way.

1147
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,210
我操
Son of a...

1148
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:58,150
别  别  冷静下来
No, no! You gotta calm down.

1149
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,180
他疯了  停下
He's crazy! Stop!

1150
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,420
大黄蜂  别犯病了
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho!

1151
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,000
我的小娇花啊
My delicate flower,

1152
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,430
你一生气我就完全不懂你在说什么了
I can't understand you when you're angry.

1153
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,700
说真的  我真的不懂你
Actually, I don't really understand you at all.

1154
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,970
我们这个工厂都准备好...
Our entire factory is up and running...

1155
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,440
稍等片刻
Excuse me one second. Hey!

1156
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,070
说你们呢  修理工
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

1157
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,740
这里在闹什么
What the hell is going on here? Huh?

1158
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,440
这辆古董破车是怎么回事
What's with this vintage crap?

1159
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,080
我们不扫描垃圾车
We're not scanning collector car junk.

1160
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,380
你以为我们在这里造的是什么
What do you think it is that we make here? Hmm?

1161
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,650
是诗歌  我们是诗人
We make poetry. We're poets.

1162
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:38,050
你为我卖命  只能犯一次错  懂了吗
All right? You work for me, you get one mistake. One. Understood?

1163
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,720
下不为例  没下次了
It won't happen again. It certainly won't.

1164
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:42,190
赶紧带着这破铜烂铁滚吧
So let's get this pathetic thing out of here.

1165
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:43,360
还有你
And you, too.

1166
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,100
非常抱歉  非常抱歉
So sorry. So sorry.

1167
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,060
我们继续
Let's move on.

1168
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,130
看着他  我去看看
Watch him. I'm going to see what I can find.

1169
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,130
安静地离开这里
Quietly get out of here.

1170
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,100
我发誓  我发誓
I swear. I swear.

1171
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,270
你一生气我就不行了
I can't bear it when you're angry.

1172
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,470
你知道我会很伤心
You know how it upsets me.

1173
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,450
大黄蜂  你得冷静一下
Bee, you gotta calm down right now.

1174
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:04,380
我特别冷静  老兄
I'm perfectly calm, dude.

1175
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,680
深呼吸  想干什么就干什么
You gotta breathe,and just do whatever you do.

1176
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,490
我很冷静  很冷静  我碰都不会碰
I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm not even touching it.

1177
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,620
我只是碰了一下下  一下下  老天
Okay, I'm barely touching it. I'm barely touching it. Oh, my God.

1178
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:13,420
-现在马上变回车  -你少屁话
- Turn back into a car right now! - Get out of my face, alright.

1179
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,790
我们的设计团队从大黄蜂着手
Our design team started with the Bumblebee

1180
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:19,100
但说真的  这外星设计很落后
but really, this alien's design was decrepit

1181
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,560
直说吧  简直是老古董
and, let's face it, antique.

1182
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,500
这他妈...
What the...

1183
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,700
-别当真  大黄蜂  -有点老旧不堪
- Don't take it personally, bee. - Kind of old and ratty.

1184
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,240
你是说很丑
You mean ugly.

1185
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,340
我靠
Oh, hell, no!

1186
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,740
别  别
No! No!

1187
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,240
你以为你比我好吗
You think you're better than me!

1188
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,320
你碰了什么
What did you touch?

1189
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,520
伙计我告诉你了  这不能碰
I told you homeboy, can't touch this.

1190
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,760
十五分钟后到我办公室来
My office in 15 minutes.

1191
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,490
这里是七号解剖室
This is dissection room seven.

1192
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,660
惊破天  报废剖析十二号
Galvatron, render postmortem number 12.

1193
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,100
在三十二号事项上
Continued head disfigurement

1194
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,070
头部仍有缺陷
at event number 32.

1195
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,570
生意谈下来了吗
So what about the deal? Is it done?

1196
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,380
拿到火种了吗
Did you get the seed?

1197
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,550
等赏金猎人找到擎天柱就能拿到了
We get it when the bounty hunter gets prime.

1198
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:10,610
但现在情况有点复杂
Meanwhile, there has been a complication.

1199
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,750
什么
A what?

1200
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,090
不  不
No, no.

1201
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,530
在KSI  我们说这个词
At KSI, we don't use words like that.

1202
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,390
那个私藏汽车人的平民
A civilian harboring the autobots

1203
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,720
黑了你的一架迷你无人机
has hacked into one of your mini-drones.

1204
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,830
也就是说  他们可能知道你也参与其中了
Meaning, they may know of your involvement.

1205
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,760
什么
What?

1206
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:35,170
刚刚很紧张啊
That was a little bit intense.

1207
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:36,740
我需要更多的变形元素
I need more Transformium,

1208
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:39,480
现在就要  来建更多模型机
and I need it now, to build more prototypes.

1209
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,310
你跟你的外星赏金猎人说
You tell your alien bounty hunter

1210
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:46,350
我把整个公司都押在这单生意上了
that I have staked my company on this deal.

1211
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,650
我只不过是把命搭上了
And I have merely staked my life.

1212
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,690
是你来找我的  记得吗
Hey, you came to me on this, remember?

1213
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,890
你从中情局退休
You retire from the CIA,

1214
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:55,760
我们公司付你七位数的工资
you get a seven-figure piece of my company,

1215
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,260
你我联手改革国防
and you and I revolutionize national defense together.

1216
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,410
但是  艾丁格先生  哥们儿
But, Attinger, buddy,

1217
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,800
为了咱俩共同的利益
for both our sakes,

1218
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,340
你必须给我弄到
you need to deliver

1219
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,670
火种
the seed.

1220
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,490
我进来了  摄像头清楚吗
I'm in. Can you see my camera?

1221
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,430
他们在融化救护车
They're melting Ratchet.

1222
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,900
他们杀害了救护车
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1223
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,630
我要撕碎他们
I'm gonna tear them apart!

1224
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,430
金属
Metal.

1225
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,090
只是金属而已  我一直这样看待他们
Just metal. That's what I always thought of them.

1226
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,370
但并非如此
Well, they're not.

1227
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,100
他们有生命  和我们一样有灵魂
They're living things, with souls like ours.

1228
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,710
我曾和一个汽车人说过话
Once, I spoke to one.

1229
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,850
你也是研究变形元素的吗
And you're working with Transformium?

1230
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,950
是啊  我就是干这个的  没错
Uh, yeah, that's what I do. I am.

1231
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,290
我是在外面挖掘它的
I'm out there digging for it.

1232
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:58,650
只是可挖掘的不多了
There's just not much left to find.

1233
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,330
你们这么迫切地需要它吗
So that's how badly you boys need more, huh?

1234
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,260
都开始融化邪恶的霸天虎了
Reduced to melting evil old Decepticons down.

1235
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,800
不  那是汽车人
No. That's an autobot there.

1236
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,700
曾为我们战斗过的汽车人
The ones who fought for us.

1237

同一个名牌在大门刷了两次
Same badge code scanned at two separate gates.

1240

我得马上封锁机密区

01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,260
站住

1244
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,300

That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

1249

执法机关  我能信任的人

1251
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,880
不要你公司的人  要政府的人

1252
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,610
耶格先生
Mr. Yeager,

1253
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,980
你觉得我是为谁工作的
who do you think I work for?

1254
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:32,920
你是为了保护家人  令人钦佩
You're trying to protect your family, that's admirable.

1255
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,020
我是为了保护国家

1256
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,820
在与外星人的战争中不受侵害
the nation from alien war.

1257
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,290
我们已经见识过了那种战争
We've had a taste of what that looks like,

1258
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,050
绝不容许再有这样的事发生
and we are not gonna tolerate another. Now...

1259
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,660
这次谈话有两种结果
There is a version of this conversation

1260
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,730
一种是你可以回到你的仓库
where you get to go back to your barn,

1261
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,330
你的女儿光荣毕业
your daughter gets to graduate with honors,

1262
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,930
你的生活也能恢复原状
and life as you know it will go on.

1263
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,940
你根本不知道你卷入了什么事
You have no idea what you're involved with here.

1264
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:55,670
是吗
Really?

1265
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,910
那另一种后果是什么呢
What's the other version of this conversation?

1266
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,810
就是你派雇佣兵杀我女儿吗
The one when you send in the hired help to murder my little girl?

1267
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,880
还是打算亲自动手
Or you gonna man up and do it yourself?

1268
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,420
随便你选
What's your preference?

1269
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:12,560
我只问你一次
I'm going to ask you this once.

1270

1274
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,840
出去  都出去
Get out! All of you!

1275
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,910
科学展览会结束了  小东西们

那是我公司的财产
That's company property!

1284
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,600
他们不是你的财产
They're not your property!

1285
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,940
他们是我的朋友
They were my friends.

1286
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,610
你现在怎么没话说了
Oh, you ain't talking so much now!

1287
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,110
因为面前站着的探长吗

1288

动手吧

你一句话我就拍扁他
Just give me the word, I'll splatter him.

1291
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,820
不如你告诉这个急脾气
Why don't you tell itchy fingers here

1292
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,420
这些都是战争遗物  废铁而已

就算我们不做  也有别人会做
Because if we don't do it, somebody else will.

因为你无法阻挡科技的脚步

我早就想开杀戒了

Your allegiance to these humans.

1377
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,050
要忠诚于某事的问题就在于
The trouble with loyalty to a cause is that the cause

1378
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,120
到头来它一定会背叛你
will always betray you.

1379
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,360
是谁派你来的
Who sent you here?

1380
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,530
你以为你是从哪来的
Where do you think you came from?

1381
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:46,130
你以为你是生下来的吗
You think you were born?

1382
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,000
不  你是被制造出来的
No. You were built.

1383
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,140
现在你的创造者要收回你
And your Creators want you back.

1384
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:56,240
我们都在为别人工作
We all work for someone.

1385
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,180
不要不要
No, no.

1386
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,250
糟糕
No.

1387
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:12,290
它抓住了她
It's got her!

1388
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:13,620
-她在车里  -泰莎
- She's in the car! - Tessa!

1389
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,120
-不要  -泰莎
- No! - Tessa!

1390
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,660
爸爸
Dad!

1391
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,130
泰莎  快出来
Tessa, get out!

1392
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,240
快出来
Get out!

1393
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,370
泰莎
Tessa!

1394
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:34,180
快出来  泰莎
Get out! Tessa!

1395
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,480
爸爸  救救我
Dad, help me!

1396
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,680
-泰莎  -救救我  爸爸
- Tessa! - Help me, help me! Dad! Dad!

1397
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,490
爸爸
Dad!

1398
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,290
-爸爸  -泰莎  打碎玻璃
- Dad! - Tessa! Break the glass!

1399
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,020
-打碎玻璃出来  -我在努力
- Break the glass to get out! - I'm trying!

1400
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,290
-泰莎  我要掉下去了  -爸
- Tessa, I can't hold on! - Dad!

1401
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,430
泰莎
Tessa!

1402
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:54,200
-救救我  -打碎玻璃  打碎玻璃
- Help me! - Just break it! Break the glass!

1403
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,200
泰莎
Tess...

1404
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,100
凯德  快去提醒其他汽车人
Cade, warn the autobots!

1405
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,170
爸爸  救救我  别丢下我
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!

1406
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,180
不
No!

1407
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,440
把那人类扔进垃圾堆
Take that human to the trash.

1408
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,090
部长先生
Mr. Secretary.

1409
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,060
我的人正在路上  这是中情局行动
My team is on the way. This is a CIA operation.

1410
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,730
飞船是我的人
This is my asset.

1411
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:01,500
让军队暂时待命
Tell the military to stand down.

1412
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,200
稍等  白宫的电话
Hang on, I have the White House.

1413
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,130
特工您好啊
Agent, hello!

1414
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,700
哎呀呀我的天
Oh, my goodness. Boy,

1415
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,740
这会儿全白宫上下可谓是群情激昂
is it a flurry of excitement over here at the White House.

1416
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,570
大家都恨不能生吞了我
Everybody is super, super mad. At me.

1417
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:12,470
我又看了一遍咱们上次的会议记录
So, I went over my notes from our last meeting,

1418
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,110
貌似没有哪条记录中提到您说
and I'm not sure when you said anything about

1419
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,210
"密歇根大道上空将出现巨型外星战舰"
"a giant alien warship over Michigan Avenue."

1420
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,810
告诉总统  这不是袭击
Tell the President this is not an attack.

1421
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,660
记得这艘船吗  擎天柱
Remember this ship, Prime?

1422
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,730
就是你们这些骑士  战士建造的
Built for all you knights, you great crusaders,

1423
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:34,430
以便你们探索宇宙
to explore the universe.

1424
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:37,670
我霸占了它  它现在是我的私人监狱了
Well, I commandeered it. It's my personal prison now.

1425
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:35,190
擎天柱
Optimus?

1426
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,870
欢迎回到骑士圣域  擎天柱
Welcome back to the knights' temenos, Prime.

1427
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,470
你让它蒙羞了
You have disgraced it.

1428
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:59,880
和其他叛徒待一起吧  亡命垃圾
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.

1429
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,650
这里都是稀有物种
It's for the rarest of specimens.

1430
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,820
是恶中至恶
The worst of the worst.

1431
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:06,190
虽然花了几个世纪
It's taken centuries,

1432
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:09,660
但除你以外的所有骑士都落入了我手中
but I've collected all the knights but you.

1433
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,470
创造者想洗牌重来
The Creators want to sweep their chessboard clean.

1434
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:26,880
我不是任何人的奴隶
I'm slave to no one.

1435
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,880
各个物种互相干预
All this species mixing with species.

1436
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:35,480
破坏了宇宙平衡
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1437
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,250
创造者不希望这样
The Creators, they don't like it.

1438
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,620
所以才造了你以供差遣
They built you to do what you were told.

1439
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,960
那飞船怎么还没飞走
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1440
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,320
再快点  大黄蜂  它在下降
Come on, Bee, it's descending.

1441
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,000
我们得上去
You got to get on it!

1442
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,230
萨沃伊  任务完成
Savoy, mission accomplished.

1443
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:53,370
禁闭抓住了擎天柱  可以完成交易了
Lockdown has Prime. The deal's going down now.

1444
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:54,890
正在前往交接点取回种子
Picking up the seed at the recon point.

1445
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,340
老巢  我是泰隆  降落点安全
Nest, Talon. L.Z. appears clear.

1446
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,380
虽然我很享受这次猎捕
Much as I've enjoyed the hunt,

1447
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,810
但我巴不得赶紧离开你们这破星球
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1448
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,070
我们的交易到此为止
Our deal is done.

1449
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,750
擎天柱换种子
One Prime for one seed.

1450
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:45,020
小心使用
Handle it with care.

1451
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:51,590
相信你们的种族已经准备好了
I trust your species is ready.

1452
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,300
我们的种族不劳你费心
Don't worry about our species.

1453
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,630
再会了  地球
Farewell, Earth.

1454
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:07,580
快点  快点
Come on, come on!

1455
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:20,920
大黄蜂  快
Bee, come on!

1456
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,360
这是个坏主意  但我就喜欢坏主意
It's a bad idea. But I'm all about bad ideas.

1457
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,360
上吧
Let's go!

1458
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,770
好好玩两把
Well, let's rock.

1459
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,390
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

1460
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,590
你要是想走  那最好现在快走
Look, you wanna cut and run, you better do it now.

1461
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:56,560
我死也不会放弃
I'm gonna die trying.

1462
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,890
听着  不是我帮你救女儿
Hey, I'm not here to help you get your daughter.

1463
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,500
而是你帮我救女友
You're here to help me get my girlfriend.

1464
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,370
启动暗物质引擎  全速前进
Engage dark-matter drives. Full power.

1465
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,050
我们现在深入敌后了
We're behind enemy lines now.

1466
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,880
禁闭的船到处是陷阱
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.

1467
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,780
谨慎行事
Eyes open.

1468
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:24,590
还得当心碎骨机  拌脑器  剥皮爪
Beware of his bone grinders, brain blinders, flesh peelers,

1469
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:26,090
基因变异器
chromosomal inverters,

1470
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,760
致瘫毒泥  黑洞暗门
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors,

1471
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,420
当然还有  辐射
and, of course, radiation.

1472
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:32,690
一定要快  出其不意
We must be quick. We have the element of surprise.

1473
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,100
除非必要  不得动武
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.

1474
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:37,670
啊  看刀
Oh, get it!

1475
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:39,400
死  死去吧
I kill you! Kill you!

1476
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,570
这些玩意儿真恶心
Ugh. I hate those things.

1477
01:29:40,570 --> 01:29:41,900
真诡异
That's freaky.

1478
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,570
已经死了
He's not alive anymore.

1479
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:46,410
寻找完毕  没找着  咱们撤吧
Well, we looked. They're not here. Let's go.

1480
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:48,610
什么  没找到泰莎我哪都不去
What? Hey, I'm not going anywhere without Tessa.

1481
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,910
我不懂  有我什么好处
I'm unclear. What's in it for me?

1482
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,050
有你什么好处
What's in it for you?

1483
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,590
悠着点  有话好好说
Easy. Let's use words.

1484
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:59,920
好处就是我不会宰了你
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.

1485
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,060
老大非救出来不可
We're getting the boss back.

1486
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,760
还有那姑娘  懂了吗
And the girl. Copy?

1487
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:08,460
好的好的  很有说服力  您真英雄
Okay, okay. Very persuasive. Textbook machismo.

1488
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:11,530
那好  咱们得搞点破坏
Well, then. We'll need to sabotage something.

1489
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,070
要快  因为暗物质引擎
Better hurry. Because dark-matter drives

1490
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:14,170
正要启动
are preparing to take off.

1491
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,000
真好
Oh, wonderful.

1492
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,670
我预计还剩十分钟
I give us 10 minutes.

1493
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,910
这就是引擎声  引擎在启动吗
Is that what that sound is? The engines filling up?

1494
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,510
你的意思是这玩意儿
Are you telling me that thing's gonna be...

1495
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:22,880
这玩意儿还有十分钟就要飞出地球了吗
It's gonna be flying out of here in 10 minutes?

1496
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,080
-对头  -才十分钟吗
- Uh-huh. - Ten minutes?

1497
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,780
没准九分钟  最快七分钟
Could be nine. Worst case, seven.

1498
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,420
人类  去搜监禁区
Humans, search the cell blocks.

1499
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,520
别废话了  咱们走
We're wasting time, let's go.

1500
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,420
我们去找操控中枢
We'll find the center core.

1501
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,820
行动
Let's move.

1502
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,260
我们得让这破船停下来
We're gonna stop this nightmare ship.

1503
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,500
这么大的船去哪找啊
We're never gonna find her in this huge ship.

1504
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,940
简直是大海捞针
Like a needle in a haystack.

1505
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,610
泰莎
Tessa!

1506
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,140
好  很好
Great. Great.

1507
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,580
干得漂亮
Oh, that was smooth.

1508
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,850
你这招太高明了
No, that was really smooth,

1509
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:03,590
这下全船都知道我们上船了
letting everybody know we're here.

1510
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:04,990
这下有人要来搜捕我们了
Now they're gonna be looking for us.

1511
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,230
快点  准星
Better hurry, Crosshairs,

1512
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:17,670
否则这飞船就要飞进太空了
before we go into space!

1513
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:19,940
原来这小东西在这呢
Ah. Here's the little jujube right here.

成功啦
Hello, mama.

1515
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,690
谁抛的锚
Who fired the anchors?

1516
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:44,860
谁在我船上捣鬼  有人越狱了
Who's on my ship? We have a loose prisoner.

1517
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:49,560

会找到她的
We'll find her.

1523
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,200

托我上去
Help me up.

1526
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,950
那边动静不太对头
There are some weird sounds out there.

1527
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:01,360
-什么声音  -我不知道

冲
Run.

1530
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,020
走之前一定要打一仗
All right, we're not going down without a fight.

1531
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,310
等他们拐弯  我们打掉他们
They turn that corner, and we're gonna take them.

1532
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:21,730
你废话说完了没
You ready or you gonna bitch out on me?

1533
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:22,720
说完了  我保护你
No, I got your back.

1534
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,720
-准备好了  -绝对的
- Are you ready? - Absolutely.

1535
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:27,820
你可别说大话  真准备好了

1536
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,860
好了好了

1537
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:32,390
我投降  我投降  我投降
Whoa, okay! I surrender! I surrender! I surrender!

1538

I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so sorry!

1539
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,270
你怎么做到的  怎么开的枪
What'd you do? How'd you do that?

1540
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:42,970
我怎么知道
I have no idea!

1541
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:45,070
你个糊不上墙的烂泥
You no-good, chickenshit little rat!

1542
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:48,310
瞧瞧  你看见了吗

1544
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,070
我的天  我得赶紧抢注专利去
Oh, man. I am so gonna patent this shit.

他也救了我  你真该看看他有多拉风
He saved me, too. You should have seen him in there.

1558
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,950
真是大英雄  咱们快走
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.

1559
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:05,820
当心点
Eyes open.

1560
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,940
马上就好
I almost got it.

1561
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,860
大块头借过  闪开闪开
Big boy coming through! Move, move, move.

1562
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,830
这肯定是超级监狱了
This has got to be the supermax.

1563
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:14,960
当心转角
Watch the corners.

1564
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,970
好多牢笼
There's a lot of cages.

1565
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:19,930
是啊  一屋子怪物可怜虫
Oh, yeah. Creepy critters in here.

1566
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,140
我可不想知道那大笼子里关的是什么
I don't want to know what's in the big cage.

1567
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:23,440
这是什么
What's this?

1568
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,010
猎狗  别多事
Hound, don't do it.

1569
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:26,980
看起来没什么危险嘛
Aw, you don't look very dangerous in there.

1570
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:31,150
真是丑出境界了
Oh, that's festering ugliness.

1571
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:34,350
我被击中  我负伤了  我的脸要化了
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting!

1572
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:35,350
好疼
It burns!

1573
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,350
我觉着是强酸
Ugh, I think it's acid!

1574
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,890
见鬼  就是口水啊
Ah, nuts. It's just shizzle.

1575
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,930
但愿不传染
I hope that's not contagious.

1576
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:46,800
我要弄死你
I got to hurt you now.

1577
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,160
你活着就讨人嫌
You're just too disturbing to live.

1578
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,530
来一发  混蛋
Take that, bitch!

1579
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,130
哈  你死翘翘了
Oh! You're dead.

1580
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,470
-猎狗  -他还活着
- Hound! - He's alive!

1581
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:56,910
撑住了老大  我们来救你了

1583
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,480
坚持住  我们来了
Hang on, we're coming for you!

1584
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,280
飞船侧翼有逃生舱
The arms of this knight ship detach!

1585
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,850
我们可以从主舰分离  那是单独的
We can break free! It's a separate ship!

1586
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:05,180
快
Hurry!

1587
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:06,550
驾驶座在哪  左边右边
Where's the cockpit? Right or left?

1588
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:08,120
-右边  -交给我了老大
- Right! - I'm on it, boss.

Hurry. We have no time.

1590

1591
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:14,460
来吧  这船我老早就想开一开了
Let's rock! I always wanted to fly one of these things.

1592
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,160
我准备好了  老大
I'm there, boss!

1593
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,560
大发明家耶格
Hey, Yeager technologies,

1594
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,430
要不你来发明出条冲出去的路吧
you gonna invent us a way out of this one?

1595
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,910
天哪
Oh, my God.

1596
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,110
我不走这个
I am not doing this.

1597
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:37,480
-我不走这个  -必须走
- I am not doing that. - Yes, we are.

1598
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:40,580
没事  能站稳  来吧
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on.

1599
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:43,350
不要
No way.

1600
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:44,210
宝贝  知道我为什么来吗
Sweetie, you know why I'm here?

1601
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:44,850
就是为了保护你
I'm here to protect you.

1602
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:46,490
我觉得特安全
You've done great at that.

1603
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:48,930
现在你要相信我  我们能下去  来吧
I want you to trust me right now. We're getting down. Let's go.

1604
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:54,220
别往下看  好吗
Don't look down, okay?

1605
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:57,100
朝前走  看  很简单的  别怕
Step. See, it's easy. Come on.

1606
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,900
小心  缆线从这里开始变稀了
Careful, these cables are starting to get thinner here!

1607
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,510
往前走  没错
Step. Step. There.

1608
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:06,140
我的天
Oh, my God!

1609
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:08,540
别往下看好吗  千万别看
See, don't look down! All right? Don't look down.

1610
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,350
我们马上就到那边的大楼了
We're gonna be at the building in no time!

1611
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,610
泰莎  你还好吗
You okay, Tess?

1612
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:14,650
一直朝前走
Keep stepping.

1613
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:17,490
天哪  天哪  爸爸
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dad! Oh!

1614
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:24,650
宝贝  别停下来  好吗
All right, sweetie. You need to keep moving here, okay?

1615
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:26,490
-来  -我不敢
- Come on! - I can't.

1616
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:28,960
我害怕
I'm freaking out.

1617
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,630
你必须朝前走
You need to move now!

1618
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:33,230
我不干了  我要回到船上去
I'm not moving! I'm going back to the ship!

1619
01:38:38,270 --> 01:38:39,470
你不能回去  亲爱的
You can't go back to the ship, honey!

1620
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,110
你看我能不能
Watch me!

1621
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:42,410
你还没满18岁
You are not 18 years old yet

1622
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:44,170
必须按我说的做  快和我们走
and you're gonna do what I say! Now let's go!

1623
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,260
我们得朝前走  别回去好吗
We need to go this way, okay. Not that way.

1624
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:55,960
罗密欧  管管她  快
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!

1625
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,190
听你爸的  勇敢点
Come on, for God's sake.

1626
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:58,290
别跟着掺和
Do not start with me.

1627
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,300
天哪  怎么了
Oh, my God, what is that?

1628
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:06,300
听我说  泰莎
All right, Tessa.

1629
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:08,440
别回头看
Don't look back.

1630
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,570
别这样说  这样我更想回头看了
Well, don't say that to me. Now I want to turn around.

1631
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,340
亲爱的  没什么
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1632
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:14,340
你这么说绝对是有什么
Well, that means it's totally major!

1633
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,650
我的枪可能要指向你那边
I have to point this gun in your direction.

1634
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,550
你以为是指着你  其实不是
It's gonna feel like it's in your direction, but I'm not.

1635
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:21,650
-动作快点  -你要害死我吗
- You better hurry. - Are you trying to kill me?

1636
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:23,480
我可是拼了老命才混上这条船的
I had to bust my ass to get up here on this spaceship!

1637
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,090
-开枪  -给我趴下
- Shoot it! - Get down now!

1638

1639
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,480
我来接你  泰莎
I'm coming for you! Tessa! Oh!

1640

抓紧
Hold on!

1642
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:27,680
大黄蜂  你最赞  你最赞
You're the best, bee! You are the best.

1643
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:30,150
没错  记住我是最棒的
You damn right! And don't ever forget it.

1644
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,450
看看  我们终于从船上出来了
You see that? Look at me! We're off the ship, right?

1645
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,160
大黄蜂  大黄蜂  自己人
Bumblebee! Bumblebee! Friendly!

1646

敌舰要追上来了  赶紧上来
Enemy ships are coming in hot. Get on! Get on!

1647
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,640
坐稳了  我可要开打了
Hold your knickers, I'm punching it!

1648
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,350
那来了三艘飞船
They got three ships on them!

1649
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:04,820
我来陪它们玩玩水
I'm giving it the juice!

1650
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,830
大黄蜂  干掉它们
Come on, bee, take them out!

1651
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,070
大黄蜂  干的漂亮
Good move, bee!

1652
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:19,830
混蛋  尝尝这个
This one's for you, a-holes!

1653
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:35,720
还有什么招快拿出来
If you're gonna do something, you better do it!

1654
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,150
来吧
Come on!

1655
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:42,320
我看不下去了  你来开  我来打
I'm sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot.

1656
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:46,090
要不让我来打
Hey, you better let me fire this big-ass gun

1657
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,940
我们好飞得快点
and make this ship go faster!

1658
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,330
听好了  教你们速成  这是追踪枪
Listen up! Crash course. Tracer guns.

1659
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,600
往前推是开火  往回扳是装弹
Punch forward to fire, slide back to reload.

1660
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,540
什么
What?

1661
01:41:56,540 --> 01:41:58,270
推端扳  重复  推端扳  重复
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1662
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,670
等等  你在说什么
Wait. What're you talking about?

1663
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,780
-我也没明白他的意思  -祝好运
- I don't know what he means. - Good luck.

1664
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,180
你要去哪
Where are you going?

1665
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:03,710
我去解恨
To lay some hate.

1666
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,190
-说一遍  -好
- Say it! - Okay.

1667
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:17,560
推  端  扳  重复
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1668
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,560
冲啊
Go!

1669
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:31,640
太爽了  打中了一架
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!

1670
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:34,740
这外星玩意真带劲
These alien guns kick ass!

1671
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,850
快点  要追上来了
Come on, he's on us!

1672
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,520
大黄蜂  甩掉它  低头
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!

1673
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,250
大黄蜂  开枪
Bee, fire the gun!

1674
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:59,330
不好
Uh-oh!

1675
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:16,950
太刺激了
That was insane!

1676
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:18,350
泰莎你还好吧
Tess, you okay?

1677
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,960
好吧  先生
Okay. Sir?

1678
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,600
你最好上了保险
You better have insurance!

1679
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:37,270
上保险
Insurance?

1680
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:39,970
这他妈可是宇宙飞船
It's a freaking spaceship.

1681
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,180
你给宇宙飞船上个保险试试
You go get insurance on a freaking spaceship.

1682
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:41,740
祝你好运  哥们儿
Good luck with that, buddy!

1683
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:45,610
这是你的车
Is this your car? Huh?

1684
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,650
宝贝  把我的外星枪拿来
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1685
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,210
给
Here you go.

1686
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:54,760
当心
Come here.

1687
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,290
-相信你老爸没错  -好的
- Trust your dad. - Okay.

1688
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:06,970
准备星际旅行
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1689
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:17,950
就快和母船分离了  马上就好
We're almost ready to separate. We're almost there.

1690
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:19,230
快  它要发动了
Hurry, he's launching!

1691
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:20,510
包在我身上  老大
All over it, chief.

1692
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,020
禁闭得跑很远才能发现我们跑掉了
Lockdown will be in deep space before he realizes I'm gone.

1693
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:24,520
我飞行技术很烂
I'm a sucky pilot,

1694
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,620
不过还是试试吧
but let's give it a whirl.

1695
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:26,620
好嘞
Hell, yeah!

1696
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:38,300
你们中情局真是低调
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1697
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:40,940
手法利落  一定不会有人注意到
What a deft hand. I'm sure nobody noticed all that.

1698
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:42,700
听着  过几分钟警察就要来了
Look. In a few minutes, there are gonna be feds

1699
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:44,270
而且得有好多  我不希望他们
all over this place, and I don't want them

1700
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:45,870
发现我们的宝贝
finding our holy grail.

1701
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,380
所以我们要把整个研发机构
So we're gonna take all our R&D,

1702
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,010
都转移到中国的工厂去  没错
we're moving it to our China facility. Yeah.

1703
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:51,750
我要你把种子带给我
I want you to bring me the seed,

1704
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,320
不过是带到中国再给我
but I want you to bring it to me there.

1705
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,580
乔舒亚先生  我觉得
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe

1706
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:59,650
你产品的测试结果好像不算理想
your product testing as perfected.

1707
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,580
到了中国我们有足够的时间改进
We have plenty of time for improvements in China.

1708
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,560
先生  惊破天他简直是
Sir, Galvatron. He was...

1709
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,430
惨败
A fiasco.

1710
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:10,770
是四不像  是耻辱
A farrago. An embarrassment.

1711
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:13,030
它还会说话  这又是怎么搞的
And he spoke. How did that happen?

1712
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,940
温布利  你知道瑕疵意味着什么吗  瑕疵
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley? A flaw?

1713
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:18,740
瑕疵等于彻底失败
A flaw is a total failure.

1714
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:20,940
我无法完全控制我的产品
I did not have control over my prototype,

1715
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,680
我想知道为什么
and I want to know why!

1716
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:44,030
我们把好消息告诉大黄蜂吧
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.

1717
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:45,730
我们弄到船了  可以离开了
We got a ship now. We're leaving.

1718
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:50,870
你们人类  我们为你们做了这么多
You humans. After all we have done.

1719
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:53,540
你们却自取灭亡
You don't know what you've wrought upon yourselves.

1720
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:54,880
什么  又怎么了
What? What is it now?

1721
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,380
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1722
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:57,810
我已经尽力了啊
I mean, I'm doing stuff out of my league here!

1723
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:01,450
你们没搞清楚到底是谁在操控谁
You don't see who's controlling who.

1724
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:04,050
和那个人造金刚交手时
Within that manmade prototype I fought,

1725
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:06,490
我感受到了威震天
I sensed the presence of Megatron.

1726
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,890
什么  引发芝加哥之战的那个霸天虎
What, the Decepticon that started the Chicago war?

1727
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:13,460
那你以为KSI
How do you think KSI

1728
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,900
是怎么造机器人的
built those bots in the first place, hmm?

1729
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,900
他们有很多
They had a whole mess of

1730
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:19,340
废掉的霸天虎脑袋  下载它们大脑的数据
dead decepticon heads and they were downloading their minds!

1731
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,540
我就负责尸检
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.

1732
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:25,370
没有工会  没有福利  什么都没有
No union, no benefits, no nothing.

1733
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,540
他们把我连到威震天上
They hooked me up to Megatron,

1734
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,410
可它的大脑根本没有死透
and that mind wasn't as dead as they thought.

1735
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:31,550
是它为他们提供了技术和数据
He fed them the science and specs!

1736
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:33,750
就为了让他们给它造一个新身体
All so they could build him a brand-new body.

1737
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:38,490
威震天则把他的意识复制进去
Then he infected it with his evil, nasty chromosomes.

1738
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,690
那些红眼珠子的东西
They had red, beady eyes.

1739
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:43,920
弄的我身上到处都是
They got all in my lovely locks.

1740
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:45,660
我现在还能闻到味道
Oh, I can smell it right now.

1741
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,600
那是不折不扣的量身定制
Total inside custom job!

1742
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,970
尽管KSI给它起了个
KSI might have named the body

1743
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:53,470
威风的名字惊破天
the snappy name of Galvatron,

1744
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:56,600
但那不过是威震天的转世
but that's just Megatron reincarnated!

1745
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,470
你明知道这些却没有提醒他们
You knew this and you didn't warn them?

1746
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:00,840
小姑娘  在死囚牢房时
Little girl, you can go to a pretty dark place

1747
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,710
会变得无比阴暗
when you on death row.

1748
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:05,780
他把KSI玩弄于股掌
He's been playing KSI all this time,

1749
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,620
就为了操控他们
all so that he could manipulate them

1750
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:08,750
让他们设法得到种子
into going after the seed.

1751
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,620
等等  种子
Wait. The seed?

1752
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:15,090
那些追杀我们的士兵
Those nasty soldiers that were chasing us.

1753
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,620
我看到他们登船  拿走了什么东西
I saw them board the ship, and they took something

1754
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:18,560
应该是种子
that they called the seed.

1755
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,860
听着  大约在六千万年前
Listen. Sixty million years ago,

1756
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:21,760
误差可能不小
give or take an eon...

1757
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,570
数千颗行星通过种子被赛博坦化
Thousands of planets were cyber-formed with seeds.

1758
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,530
它们会将你们的有机世界
They turned your organic life

1759
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:32,810
变成我们所需的基本金属元素
into our elemental metals.

1760
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:37,400
我们的祖先为了创造我们
Our creators destroyed your world

1761
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,850
毁灭了你们的世界
to make us.

1762
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:42,680
这也是惊破天要做的事
And that's what Galvatron wants to happen again.

1763
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:44,490
它想在最大的城市
He wants to detonate that seed

1764
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:47,120
引爆种子  消灭百万人类
in the biggest city and kill millions!

1765
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:50,790
它要以这种方式向世界宣告它的华丽回归
He's gonna show the world, "Baby, I'm back."

1766
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:54,930
爆炸波会把整个城市烧成个金属熔炉
The blast wave will incinerate that city into molten metal.

1767
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:58,130
它将拥有足够的资源组建一支庞大的军队
He'll have enough to build a massive army

1768
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:01,870
然后把你们人类消灭干净
and annihilate your species forever.

1769
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:03,470
你们这群愚蠢贪婪的混蛋
You dumb, greedy bastards

1770
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:05,110
完全是自掘坟墓
just brought extinction to yourself.

1771
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:06,080
反正也不关我的事  我总算是自由了
Not my problem though, I'm free at last.

1772
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,810
这对我来说可是好事  我要走了
Whole thing worked out good for me. I'm walking.

1773
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:11,880
我们得在惊破天之前找到种子
We got to get the seed before Galvatron does.

1774
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:16,590
中国  北京

1775
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:30,140
种子将是拯救公司的关键
The seed is going to be the salvation of our company.

1776
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:33,000
我们今晚就运送
We take delivery tonight.

1777
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,500
下个月  我们将在蒙古沙漠
And next month, we detonate safely

1778
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,600
安全引爆
in the Mongolian desert.

1779
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:39,170
我们制造的变形元素
And we'll create enough transformium

1780
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,570
够使用一百年
for a hundred years.

1781
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:47,780
老爸  我不想再逃亡和偷窃了
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing.

1782
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:49,720
有地方睡觉了
Well, a place to sleep.

1783
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,250
紧接着就又干一票闯空门
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1784
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:58,990
我在你这个年纪时
You know, when I was your age,

1785
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:02,130
喜欢来点放纵  喜欢香车美女
I liked to get a little wild. I liked cars, girls.

1786
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:09,100
然后就有了泰莎
But then there was Tessa.

1787
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:11,140
她出生后  我心里只剩下了
And when she was born, all I ever wanted out of life

1788
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:12,900
她的快乐  健康  安全
was for her to be happy and healthy and safe.

1789
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,710
我总以为有我保护她就够了
Somehow I thought I'd always be enough to protect her.

1790
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:20,010
但并非如此
But I won't be.

1791
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,150
从来不是如此
I'll never be.

1792
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,290
所以我希望有人能做到
So somebody better be.

1793
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:32,590
谢谢你和我们共度难关  小可爱
Thanks for being here today, lucky charms.

1794
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:38,880
我也谢谢你没趁机宰了我
Well, thanks for not shooting me when you had the chance.

1795
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:40,670
以后机会多着呢
Oh, I'll have more.

1796
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:43,760
可不是吗
Yeah, I can see that.

1797
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:47,720
我们刚刚拦截了一通密报
We've intercepted the encrypted communications.

1798
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:52,350
乔舒亚·乔伊斯正赶往他中国广州的工厂
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory in Guangzhou, China.

1799
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:54,560
听着  大老板
Hey, big shot.

1800
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,980
你的公司麻烦大了
Your company's in serious trouble.

1801
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,320
你最好确保你有个好律师
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1802
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:02,190
是吗  我看该找律师的是你
Really? Well, you better have a great one

1803
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,820
这城市将被夷为平地  而这都是因为你
'cause you're about to be responsible for the annihilation of a city.

1804
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:06,320
你现在给我听着
Now you listen to me.

1805
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,830
你的技术被黑  产品被感染
Your tech has been hacked. Your prototypes are infected.

1806
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:11,200
惊破天已经开始在找那枚种子了
And now galvatron is after that seed.

1807
01:50:11,450 --> 01:50:12,770
我知道你良心未泯
Look. I know you have a conscience

1808
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:14,460
因为你我一样  都是发明家
because you're an inventor, like me.

1809
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:17,540
千万不要让惊破天接近种子
Do not let Galvatron anywhere near that seed.

1810
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,250
惊破天受我控制  我制造了他
I control Galvatron. I created him.

1811
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:22,420
我想你心里其实很清楚
Deep down, I know you know.

1812
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:25,680
一直都是他在操纵你
Your prototype's been controlling you.

1813
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,680
坐这玩意儿绕地球半圈快吗
How fast can that thing get us halfway around the world?

1814
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:33,180
非常快
Very.

1815
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,890
这可是宇宙飞船
It's a spaceship.

1816
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:55,250
要想一起走  现在就得上路了
If we're traveling, now's the time.

1817
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:58,310
我只是想让生活恢复平静
All I want is to have our life back.

1818
01:50:58,350 --> 01:50:59,920
去还是留  取决于你自己
It's your call. Whatever you want.

1819
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:07,510
是靠自己更安全  还是和他们在一起呢
Are we safer on our own, or are we safer with them?

1820
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,020
她是个值得珍惜的宝贝
She's a keeper.

1821
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,690
大概是随了她妈妈吧
Must take after her mom.

1822
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,900
这次还真让你说对了
I can't argue with that, kid.

1823
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,600
走吧  我们去把种子夺回来
Move! We're retrieving the seed,

1824
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:31,740
但以后我们也不必再保护人类了
but then we're done defending the humans.

1825
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:32,830
什么  不必
What, done?

1826
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:34,120
什么意思  什么叫不必了
What do you mean, you're done?

1827
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:37,330
意思就是拜拜再见永别了
Means "Finished," "See ya," "Good-bye."

1828
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:53,640
劫走了飞船的一部分
Hijacked part of my ship?

1829
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,640
你们都是干什么吃的
How did you let this happen?

1830
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:59,190
给我关掉暗物质引擎  掉转航线
Shut down dark-matter drive, reverse course at light speed,

1831
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:00,730
火速返回地球
and get us back!

1832
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,440
擎天柱抢走了我的战利品展柜
Prime's taken my trophy case.

1833
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,650
我一定会让他死的很难看
And he will feel my wrath!

1834
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,830
KSI 中国区工厂

1835
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:15,410
欢迎来到中国
Welcome to China.

1836
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:17,200
隔离惊破天  告诉工程师
Put Galvatron in containment. Tell the techs

1837
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,660
不要启动它
do not activate him.

1838
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:19,830
好的  先生
Absolutely, sir.

1839
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:26,050
乔伊斯
Joyce.

1840
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:30,630
我都快等不及把这玩意儿给你了
I cannot tell you how enthused I am to deliver this.

1841
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,350
外星礼物清单上的第一名吧
Top of your alien wish list.

1842
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:37,480
它是你的了  或者说
It's yours. Or rather...

1843
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:38,930
是我们的了
ours.

1844
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:43,480
我想先看看我的预付款
I will need to see my advance.

1845
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:46,150
500万公司股份
Five million shares of the company.

1846
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:48,490
我们联手将结束人类战争
Together, we're gonna end human warfare.

1847
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:51,320
一支全自动化军队将代替人类出战
We're about to build a fully automated U.S. Army.

1848
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:54,660
想想我们能挽救多少美国人的生命
Just think of all the American lives we're gonna save.

1849
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:11,470
什么时候可以开始批量生产
So how soon until we can start continuous production?

1850
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:27,270
我看这件事不如缓缓吧
You know, why don't we take a beat on this for a minute?

1851
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:31,240
我刚发现了一些新数据  而且...
I have some new data that I discovered and...

1852
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:32,150
你不会是要反悔吧
You're not backing out on me here?

1853
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,820
不  怎么会  我只是...
No, I'm not backing out. I just...

1854
01:53:34,030 --> 01:53:34,990
我当然想要种子
I want the seed.

1855
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:36,330
没说我不想要它
I'm not saying I don't want the seed.

1856
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,990
我只是不知道是不是....
I'm just saying I don't know if I...

1857
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:40,500
是不是我现在就需要它
if I want the seed right now.

1858
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:44,250
你知道牺牲了多少精英拿到了它吗
Good men have died trying to get that thing for us.

1859
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,380
是为你
For you.

1860
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,630
我当然知道你做了些什么
I know what you did to get that thing.

1861
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:50,260
全是些见不得人的非法勾当
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1862
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:52,550
我可以分分钟让你下台  黑色行动先生
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black ops.

1863
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,840
最好不要威胁我
Don't you threaten me.

1864
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:56,300
年少时我就创立了这家公司
I started this company when I was a boy,

1865
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:59,060
梦想着让这个世界更和平美好
with a dream of making the world a better place.

1866
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:01,520
有意思  我的梦和你的一样
Funny. I had the same dream.

1867
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:05,690
可你却一路顺风顺水  几百万信手拈来
Somewhere along the way, you made billions of dollars.

1868
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:08,570
所以麻烦你告诉我我的梦还缺点什么
So why don't you tell me what's missing from my dream?

1869
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,690
我儿时的梦想怎么就
Why don't you tell me what's missing

1870
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:11,150
这么打水漂了
from my boyhood dream?

1871
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:15,450
我为国家效力了几十年
I have served my country for decades

1872
01:54:15,490 --> 01:54:17,280
才得到了空前的盛世
of unparalleled prosperity

1873
01:54:17,310 --> 01:54:19,990
你现在可是我手里的金钥匙
and you are my golden parachute.

1874
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:23,960
有什么好处的话  休想丢下我
So you are damn well jumping out of the plane with me!

1875
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:37,510
惊破天在此
I am Galvatron!

1876
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:43,980
出什么事儿了
What's going on?

1877
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:46,690
你那心爱的惊破天自己启动了
Your Galvatron has gone active.

1878
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:48,980
你到底对我隐瞒了什么
What haven't you been telling me?

1879
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:51,570
去找达西  叫一辆车在楼下候着
Find Darcy, and bring a car around downstairs.

1880
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:52,400
动静小点儿
Quietly.

1881
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,490
刚刚出了点小状况
We got a factory emergency.

1882
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,740
我得带你离开这里
I have to get you out of here.

1883
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:57,910
-什么情况  -带他们离开
- What the hell's going on? - Take them outside.

1884
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:00,160
我们可是说好了的  你得到你想要的了
We had a deal. You've got what you wanted.

1885
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,240
是"它"想要的
I got what "It" wanted.

1886
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:08,800
我的兄弟们  今天你们将恢复自由之身
My brothers, today I grant you your freedom.

1887
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,300
从现在起  你们得听从我的指挥
And from now on, you are commanded by me.

1888
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:15,220
起来吧
Rise up!

1889
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:20,600
给我把种子找回来
Go find my seed!

1890
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,200
再去最大的城市把种子引爆
Detonate the seed in the largest city.

1891
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,150
公主大人  我不想听你说什么
Listen, princess. I don't wanna hear,

1892
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,030
"我早说过"
"I told you so,"

1893
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,910
但这确实比我想象的要危险
but this is much more dangerous than I think.

1894
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:44,500
快上车
Get in.

1895
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:53,090
惊破天也黑了其他机器人
Galvatron's hacked into the others.

1896
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:54,670
-什么  -乔舒亚
- What? - Joshua.

1897
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,440
-你得管管这儿  -开车  开车
- You have to contain this! - Drive, drive!

1898
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:57,720
你个混...
Son of a...

1899
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,550
快点  跟上  跟上  动作麻利点
Come on. Let's move, let's move, let's move!

1900
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:20,780
我知道怎么在香港甩掉他们
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.

1901
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,950
那儿有防御工程  应该能上帮大忙
I know a military garrison there that will help us.

1902
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:26,750
威胁中情局的职业杀手
Threatening a professional CIA killer.

1903
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:29,620
好像不怎么光彩
Possibly not my finest hour.

1904
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:30,960
这句话要是能收回就好了
I'd like to have that one back.

1905
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:31,500
杀手
Killer?

1906
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:33,090
-我还以为你们是朋友  -不
- I thought they were your friends! - No,

1907
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:34,710
不是朋友  商业伙伴罢了
No. Not friends. Business.

1908
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,170
炸弹也是他们给的
They gave me this bomb.

1909
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,170
-炸弹  -天哪
- Bomb? - Oh!

1910
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:39,550
你是说袋子里有颗炸弹吗
Is that a bomb in the bag?

1911
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,260
没错  袋子里是有颗炸弹
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.

1912
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:42,760
我去
Shit.

1913
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:54,950
你之前说不必继续保护人类了
When you said you were done fighting for humans,

1914
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:56,360
你不是认真的  对吧
you didn't mean that, did you?

1915
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:00,570
我们到底还要牺牲多少
How many more of my kind must be sacrificed

1916
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:03,120
来弥补你们犯下的过错
to atone for your mistakes?

1917
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,490
你以为人类是完美的吗
Well, what do you think being human means?

1918
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:05,530
人类就是这样
That's what we do.

1919
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,540
人类会犯错误
We make mistakes.

1920
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:09,870
但有时候正是这些错误
And sometimes out of those mistakes

1921
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:11,580
带来了最棒的意外
come the most amazing things.

1922
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,050
当初把你修好  只是为了拿赏金
When I fixed you, it was for a reward.

1923
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:23,470
没别的  仅此而已  就是为了钱
That was it. That was why. For money.

1924
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:26,600
这是我犯下的错误
And it was me making a mistake.

1925
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:29,560
可若不是那一时贪念也就没有你了
Without it, you wouldn't be here.

1926
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:34,520
所以不管你对我们有多失望
So even if you got no faith in us,

1927
01:57:34,810 --> 01:57:36,360
也请你和我一样
I'm asking you to do what I do.

1928
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,150
试着从废墟里寻找珍宝
I'm asking you to look at all the junk and see the treasure.

1929
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:41,820
你需要保持信念  擎天柱
You gotta have faith, prime,

1930
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:44,200
相信我们拥有的可能性
in who we can be.

1931
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:53,460
香港

1932
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:57,170
钱就这么打水漂
I'm seriously pissed

1933
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:58,710
真是不爽到家了
we're not getting paid for this.

1934
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:01,970
至少可以享受掉除掉他的乐趣
Well, at least we get to kill him.

1935
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:05,140
有了卫星追踪  看他们能跑哪儿去
They're not getting away if I still got him on satellite.

1936
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:08,560
以为自己能逃出中情局的掌心  太有才
Some genius. Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

1937
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:11,560
-乔舒亚  -怎么了
- Joshua? - Yes?

1938
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,350
那炸弹的威力有多大
How lethal is that bomb?

1939
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:15,310
不清楚  我问问
Uh, I don't know. Let me check.

1940
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:23,360
太棒了  我爱死这个了
I love this! This is so good.

1941
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:24,200
稍等
Oh, hang on.

1942
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:28,080
老大在香港来信了
I'm getting a text from il duce in Hong Kong.

1943
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:31,750
"给我查出这颗种子的爆炸范围"
"Need to know the seed's estimated blast range."

1944
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:32,660
什么
Duh.

1945
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:42,970
我来引开他们
I'll do the diversion!

1946
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,590
把那玩意儿送到安全的地方去
Get that thing somewhere safe!

1947
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:52,680
老兄  杀手就快来了  快点行吗
Killers are coming! Guys, we gotta go!

1948
01:58:53,470 --> 01:58:54,390
伙计们  老兄...
Guys, guys...

1949
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,190
-给我闭嘴  -好吧好吧  对不起
- Shut up! Shut up! - All right! I'm sorry, All right!

1950
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:57,230
你们继续  你们继续
Go ahead, go ahead!

1951
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,400
-搞定了吗  -别别别  等一下
- Okay, good? - No, don't... don't go! Wait!

1952
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:04,360
好了  他卖了
Okay, he's in.

1953
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:06,530
好了吗  快走快走
Okay, okay, okay.

1954
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,820
你得给我加薪  我要加薪
I need a raise! I want a raise.

1955
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,420
行  行  行  你要什么都行
All right, yes! I'm sure whatever you want!

1956
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:15,330
快快快
Go, go, go!

1957
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,330
我去  不是吧
Oh, no!

1958
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:23,710
我们死定了  我们死定了
Death is on our tail! Death is on our tail!

1959
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:32,490
快闪开  你们这群人
Get out of the way, all of you!

1960
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:33,520
别挡路中间
Get out of the way!

1961
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:37,350
我可不想就这么挂了
I don't want to die like this.

1962
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:54,330
围住他们
Box them in.

1963
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:10,150
-别停  别停  快点  -来了
- Hurry, hurry! Come, come. - Okay, yes.

1964
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,970
你去哪儿我跟哪儿  你简直太棒了
I'll follow you anywhere. You're amazing!

1965
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,560
我得把你送到天台去
We're going to get you to the roof.

1966
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:14,810
行  行  没问题
Good, good, good.

1967
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:21,060
进去
Go!

1968
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:29,670
像蘑菇云一样
哈哈

1969
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:30,820
像蘑菇云一样哈哈
Like a tactical nuke.
像蘑菇云一样
哈哈

1970
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:31,030
像蘑菇云一样哈哈
Like a tactical nuke.

1971
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,030
"哈哈"  太搞笑
Lol. That's funny.

1972
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:36,700
我简直  这是真的假的啊
I can't... This is really happening.

1973
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,370
我一个身价百亿的大亨  竟然...
A man, me, who is worth over 20 billion dollars is now...

1974
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:44,750
竟然被中情局杀手追得满街跑  你信吗
being chased by CIA assassins. That's the truth.

1975
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:48,090
先不说手下的机器人全部造反
And in the middle of a robot uprising.

1976
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:54,100
我还带着一颗随时会爆炸的核弹
And I'm carrying what is, in essence, a tactical nuke.

1977
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,150
这还不算什么...
And the great thing is I...

1978
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,310
最棒的是我竟然
The great thing is that I'm...

1979
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,270
竟然感觉不到时差的存在
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.

1980
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,810
-闹够了没  -什么
- Just stop it! - What?

1981
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,900
你得抓紧时间躲到天台上去
You need to hide on the roof of this building.

1982
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:04,820
我叫直升机去救你
I'll get you a helicopter extraction.

1983
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:08,530
好吧
Okay.

1984
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:12,610
我挺喜欢她的
I like her.

1985
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:15,160
多迷人的姑娘
I find her very attractive.

1986
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,290
他一定在这儿附近
He's definitely around here.

1987
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:20,540
求你了  快动啊
Come on, come on.

1988
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:23,960
这儿有辆摩托
I got a bike!

1989
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,920
过去检查一下
Check in there!

1990
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:29,090
他们就是我说的中情局杀手
These are the CIA assassins I told you about.

1991
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,260
-呃  伙计们  -给我走
- Whoa! Guys. - Let's go.

1992
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,180
你们好啊
Hello.

1993
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:43,940
住手
Hey!

1994
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:45,270
好吧
Okay.

1995
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,240
-捡起来  -好吧  我这就去
- Pick it up. - All right. I'm gonna.

1996
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:08,550
老天
Wow.

1997
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:10,920
天哪  太谢谢你了
Wow. Wow, thank you.

1998
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:13,180
天哪  你又是怎么...
Wow! How did you...

1999
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:15,930
警校训练  去商学院之前参加的
Police training, prior to my MBA.

2000
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,470
我爱你
I love you.

2001
02:02:19,010 --> 02:02:20,140
快去天台
Get to the roof.

2002
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:21,030
好吧  这就去
All right, okay.

2003
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:19,120
种子就在这儿  给我找出来
Find my seed. It's here!

2004
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:21,280
那些机器人一直在追踪那枚种子
Those prototypes are after that bomb.

2005
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:31,210
不会吧
No!

2006
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:34,260
别  别  别走
No, no, no, no!

2007
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,690
上面是什么人
Who the hell's aboard that?

2008
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:40,610
这不可能
Impossible.

2009
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:52,890
弟兄们  是汽车人  击落它
Brothers, it's the autobots! Shoot them down!

2010
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:59,730
乔舒亚
Joshua!

2011
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:00,890
光头
Hey, baldy!

2012
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,730
是我
Hey, it's me! Hey!

2013
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:03,850
带上它  我们走
Bring it over now! Let's go.

2014
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:06,970
快  快跑
Hurry up, run!

2015
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:08,940
-快点  快  -我们走  离开这
- Hurry! Come on! - Let's go! Move it!

2016
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,900
快过来  给我
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now!

2017
02:04:12,010 --> 02:04:13,570
看来有敌人来了
Looks like we might have company.

2018
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,020
我们中弹了  中弹了
We're hit! We're hit!

2019
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:54,010
要是留他们活口  我们就死定了
They live, they talk, we're dead.

2020
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,880
格杀勿论
Kill them all.

2021
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:56,880
乐意效劳
Pleasure.

2022
02:04:59,590 --> 02:05:01,220
下面有十个
I count ten below!

2023
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:04,990
你不是说只有一个原型机被感染吗
I thought you said you had one prototype get infected.

2024
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:06,890
他又控制了其他五十个
Now he's got operational control of my other 50.

2025
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,900
我们走
Come on.

2026
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,830
爬上去  爬上去
Climb, climb!

2027
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,170
包围他们
Surround them.

2028
02:05:19,070 --> 02:05:20,840
虽然祸是我闯下的
I may have started the apocalypse,

2029
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:22,240
但你把家人都扯进来了
but you brought your family.

2030
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:24,280
家长做得太不称职
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.

2031
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,180
再乱说我就揍你一顿
Oh, I'm about one second away from knocking you out,

2032
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:27,280
带上炸弹  把你扔在这
taking the bomb, and just leaving you here.

2033
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,550
那算是帮我大忙了
Please, do me a favor.

2034
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:31,850
擎天柱  汽车人  还活着吗
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

2035
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:33,010
-去你的  混蛋  -快走
- Come on, bitch! - Come on!

2036
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,700
撤退  撤退
Evac! Evac!

2037
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:47,870
我们被夹击了
We're getting flanked!

2038
02:05:49,870 --> 02:05:51,000
下方还有
We got company below!

2039
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:57,680
我的大屁股被卡住了  大黄蜂  射击
My fat ass is stuck! Bee, take the shot!

2040
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,060
进电梯  进去
Into the elevator! Get in. Okay.

2041
02:06:10,060 --> 02:06:11,060
快点
Come on.

2042
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:15,600
下去  下去
Get down, get down!

2043
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:18,060
关门  关门
Close the door! Close the door!

2044
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:22,740
还不走  怎么不关门
Won't go! It's not closing!

2045
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,570
超重了
There's too much weight.

2046
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:26,010
-下去找大黄蜂  -爸爸  别走
- Get back down to Bumblebee! - Dad, no!

2047
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:28,870
冲我来
You want me!

2048
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:41,220
中央电梯
Center elevator.

2049
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:47,260
他会没事的
He's gonna be okay.

2050
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:03,380
外星炸弹来了  外星炸弹来了
Alien bomb! Alien bomb, coming through!

2051
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,350
快让开  让...  小朋友们好
Clear the way! Clear the... hi, kids.

2052
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:07,210
快让开  女士们
Coming through, ladies!

2053
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:09,320
借过  借过  女士们  借过
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies! Excuse me!

2054
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:11,150
天啊
Oh, my God!

2055
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:13,350
快他妈的闪开用中文怎么说
How do you say, "Get the fuck out of the way" in Chinese?

2056
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:59,770
这里可不低呢
That's a long way down.

2057
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:04,060
真的假的啊
You've got to be kidding me.

2058
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:07,010
不
No!

2059
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,550
拜托
Come on.

2060
02:08:33,470 --> 02:08:35,200
我会抓到你的
I'm coming for you!

2061
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:12,210
你当初真不该藏下那辆卡车
Never should have hidden that truck.

2062
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:14,070
你真不该伤害我家人
You should have never came after my family.

2063
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:16,340
算你不走运  我们都有家人
Tough luck, you're here. We all have family.

2064
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:18,950
没错  但我会活着见到她们的
Yeah, but I'm gonna live to see mine.

2065
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,510
我要抓的逃犯在哪
Where is my escaped bounty?

2066
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:47,110
汽车人在这
Autobots at this location.

2067
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:49,380
擎天柱在附近
Prime is close.

2068
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:52,950
尽管下手吧
Do whatever you have to do.

2069
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:55,850
正合我意
I intend to.

2070
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:00,790
-达西  -乔舒亚
- Darcy! - Joshua!

2071
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:01,520
那边过来三个
We got three more coming in from that way!

2072
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,990
大黄蜂  泰莎呢
Bee, where's Tessa?

2073
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,160
爸爸
Dad!

2074
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,930
我们是陷入了困境了  好吗
We got a real dilemma here. Okay?

2075
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:12,030
我创造的精密机器人
I created incredible robots.

2076
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:14,430
都是为了打败变形金刚而设计的
It's all designed to kick that fat Transformer's ass.

2077
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:16,970
所以我们真的必败无疑
So, really, this is a no-win situation.

2078
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:18,270
没什么好说的
It's over.

2079
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:20,040
这话好过分
That was mean.

2080
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:23,410
你不能接受残酷的事实  我也没办法
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't handle the cold-hearted truth!

2081
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:25,980
擎天柱  我可以怎么对待这些人类
Optimus, what are my orders with these humans?

2082
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:27,180
可以捏扁那个光头吗
Can I squish the bald guy?

2083
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:28,880
他们处境危险
They're in trouble.

2084
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:30,920
这又不关我们的事
Nah! This isn't our fight!

2085
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:33,590
给他们当炮灰  我受够了
I'm done being an underdog. Underdogs suck!

2086
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:35,350
他们就该自作自受
I say they get what they deserve.

2087
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,090
怎么办  擎天柱
What's the play, Prime?

2088
02:10:37,090 --> 02:10:39,560
该找点援军了
It's time for reinforcements.

2089
02:10:42,330 --> 02:10:45,230
听命于你的骑士吧
Recognize one of your knights.

2090
02:11:06,530 --> 02:11:09,000
传奇继续
The legend exists.

2091
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,600
快走
Come on.

2092
02:11:18,570 --> 02:11:20,270
快跟上 跟上 我们走
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!

2093
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:21,600
大黄蜂  快走
Bee, go!

2094
02:11:26,310 --> 02:11:28,210
快  离开这  离开这
Come on, we got to move! Let's go, move!

2095
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:34,910
泰莎呢  泰莎过来  快
Where's Tessa? Tessa, get over here! Come on.

2096
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,020
过来
Get over here!

2097
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:39,120
躲在我身后  我掩护你们
Stay behind me! I'm covering you!

2098
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:41,350
要是掩护没了  说明我死了
If I stop covering you, it means I'm dead.

2099
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,480
不过那不可能
But that ain't gonna happen.

2100
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:44,960
吃枪子吧
Take that!

2101
02:11:47,530 --> 02:11:49,630
我是个邪恶机器勇士
I'm a wicked warrior robot!

2102
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:52,000
该死
Goddamn!

2103
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,040
快  我们离开这
Come on! We gotta move now!

2104
02:11:54,570 --> 02:11:55,570
快跑  快跑
Go, go!

2105
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:03,980
敌人从那边过来了
We got hostiles coming down the street!

2106
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:06,980
快走
Go!

2107
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:13,650
大黄蜂  十二点方向  火力掩护
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

2108
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:19,590
我们被包围了
We're surrounded!

2109
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:20,590
快跑  快跑  快跑
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

2110
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:22,130
火箭
Rocket!

2111
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:24,200
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

2112
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,260
低下身
Get down!

2113
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:30,100
真是个绝佳的藏身之处
Oh, this is the perfect place to hide.

2114
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:31,570
大玻璃箱子
A big glass box!

2115
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:32,970
生怕别人找不到
Nobody will ever find us here!

2116
02:12:32,970 --> 02:12:33,970
真是...
That's...

2117
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:39,710
开玩笑呢吧
You've got to be kidding me.

2118
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:43,950
传奇勇士们  当初创造我们的力量
Legendary warriors, the powers that created us

2119
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:47,050
现在却要毁灭我们
now want us all extinguished.

2120
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:50,990
我们必须团结一致  否则只会沦为奴隶
We must join forces, or else forever be their slaves.

2121
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:55,960
今天不和我们并肩作战
So today you stand with us

2122
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:59,330
就得与我为敌
or you stand against me.

2123
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,310
让擎天柱自己搞定吧
We'll let Prime figure this one out.

2124
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:10,140
明智
Very wise.

2125
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:12,350
我才不愿意跟他们混在一起
There's no friggin' way I'm staying down here with them.

2126
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:13,450
休想  没门
No way. No way.

2127
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:22,660
只有团结一致  才能生存
Only together can we survive!

2128
02:13:24,330 --> 02:13:25,460
听从我的指挥
Let me lead you!

2129
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,240
不是吧
Oh, no.

2130
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:41,440
我还以为会变成大车呢
I was expecting a giant car.

2131
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:42,510
来吧
Come here!

2132
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:51,280
我们会带给你们自由
We're giving you freedom.

2133
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:10,140
捍卫我的家人
You defend my family,

2134
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:13,710
不然死路一条
or die.

2135
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:18,740
汽车人
Autobots,

2136
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:21,580
我们要证明自己
we're going to prove who we are

2137
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:23,180
活出我们的价值
and why we're here!

2138
02:14:24,620 --> 02:14:27,450
怎么就是心甘情愿为他卖命呢
Ugh, you just want to die for the guy.

2139
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:30,460
这是领导力  或者叫洗脑什么的
That's leadership. Or brainwashing, or something.

2140
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:33,790
不  这就是擎天柱的魅力
No. That's Optimus Prime.

2141
02:14:40,370 --> 02:14:42,670
汽车人  我们一起进攻
Autobots, we charge together!

2142
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:45,740
现在  进击
Now, roll out!

2143
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:51,440
我们被围攻了  四面受敌
We're getting boxed in! We're getting flanked everywhere!

2144
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:52,780
请求支援
Help me out here!

2145
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:53,780
不留活口
Kill anything that moves!

2146
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:56,750
快  凯德  开枪
Come on, Cade, shoot!

2147
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:00,420
来受死吧  混蛋
Come and get some, you little bitch!

2148
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:01,550
子弹来了
Incoming!

2149
02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:08,330
真不敢相信我把性命托付给你了
I can't believe I'm putting my life in your hands.

2150
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:11,770
别客气  枪给你  你来拿着
Here, be my guest. Take the gun. Come on, take it.

2151
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:12,360
不  我不想拿枪
No, I don't want the gun.

2152
02:15:12,530 --> 02:15:13,630
那就躲在下面  闭嘴
Then stay under there and shut up!

2153
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:14,300
没问题
All right.

2154
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:16,220
你用的好所以自己留着吧
You're good with the gun. So you keep it.

2155
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:21,840
弹药不足了
Running out of guns and ammo.

2156
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:33,150
来受死吧
Come and get some!

2157
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:35,550
你们死期已到
You're all gonna die!

2158
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:57,780
干得漂亮
Way to go, baby!

2159
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:00,350
好枪法  凯德
Good shooting, Cade!

2160
02:16:02,450 --> 02:16:05,450
我就像个胖胖的芭蕾舞娘
I'm like a fat ballerina

2161
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:07,790
但招招致命
who takes scalps and slits throats!

2162
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:16,600
来吃一口幸运饼干
Got your fortune cookie!

2163
02:16:18,630 --> 02:16:19,670
滚开  臭小子
Come here, you little punk.

2164
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:26,810
拉开安全栓  我要扛不住了
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here!

2165
02:16:26,810 --> 02:16:28,310
给你  给你
Here! Take it. Take it!

2166
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:30,340
帮个忙  帮个忙
Little help! Little help!

2167
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:31,810
触发了  触发了  快接着
It's live! It's live, it's live. Take it!

2168
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:32,850
给我做什么
What do you want me to do with it?

2169
02:16:32,850 --> 02:16:34,380
-扔过去  -给我  给我
- Just throw it! - Give, give, give!

2170
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:50,560
坏消息  凯德
Got some bad news, Cade.

2171
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:53,270
我没有弹药  也无路可走了
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas.

2172
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:04,510
再快些  冲
Faster! Go!

2173
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:13,420
我要杀了你
I'll kill you!

2174
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:44,450
冲啊
Charge!

2175
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:58,660
这不可能
No, impossible!

2176
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:00,570
他们把一切都搞砸了
They're ruining everything!

2177
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:02,670
吃我一拳
Take that!

2178
02:18:10,480 --> 02:18:11,480
滚开
Get off me.

2179
02:18:13,550 --> 02:18:15,350
-站起来  猎狗  -我不行了
- Get up, hound! - I can't go on.

2180
02:18:15,350 --> 02:18:16,750
你要继续奋战
But you gotta keep fighting!

2181
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:18,020
油箱空了  伙计
Tank's empty, bro.

2182
02:18:19,590 --> 02:18:20,820
敌人越来越多  如果你不继续奋战
There's more of 'em coming. If you don't get up

2183
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:22,380
我们必死无疑  上啊
and fight, we're going to die. Let's go!

2184
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:28,630
出击
Attack!

2185
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:34,400
擎天柱在此
Optimus is here!

2186
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:47,050
大黄蜂  跳上来
Bee, jump!

2187
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,600
最讨厌廉价山寨货了
I hate cheap knockoffs.

2188
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:12,930
干得漂亮
Awesome job!

2189
02:20:12,930 --> 02:20:15,100
-你  -你说谁
- You. - Who?

2190
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:16,570
-你  -上前来
- You. - Step forward.

2191
02:20:16,570 --> 02:20:18,170
等等  干什么
Wait. Why?

2192
02:20:18,170 --> 02:20:22,610
人类的灭顶之灾都是你的科技带来的
Your science will be responsible for humanity's extinction.

2193
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:24,810
好吧  我知道你对这个
All right. I know that you're sensitive

2194
02:20:24,810 --> 02:20:27,710
生物伦理困境很敏感
to this whole bioethical dilemma.

2195
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:29,080
也许他只是想听你承认
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is

2196
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:30,420
有些东西本不该被发明出来
that some things should never be invented.

2197
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:36,720
好吧
Okay.

2198
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,460
我们会带领你们出城
We'll lead you out of the city.

2199
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:40,590
把种子安全带到山头去
Get that seed safely to the hills.

2200
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:43,030
用这辆车
Use this car.

2201
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:44,030
他差点吃了我
He almost ate me!

2202
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:48,200
可以启动
All right, we're good!

2203
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,140
出发吧
All right, let's go!

2204
02:20:52,470 --> 02:20:53,550
让出驾驶座
Get out of that seat.

2205
02:20:55,070 --> 02:20:56,610
你女儿碰到我算你走运
And you're one lucky dad to have me.

2206
02:20:58,810 --> 02:21:00,930
小可爱  我同意  你来开  出发
Okay, lucky charms. You got that. You drive. Let's go.

2207
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:13,500
你干什么了
What did you do?

2208
02:21:13,730 --> 02:21:16,500
我不知道  但有麻烦了
I don't know. I don't know, but it's an issue.

2209
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:17,530
-你按了什么键吗  -它要爆炸了吗
- Did you press a button? - Is it gonna blow up?

2210
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:19,130
我不知道
I don't know.

2211
02:21:19,130 --> 02:21:20,930
这玩意儿响了  肯定是你按到什么了
This thing is beeping now, so you must have hit something.

2212
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:23,100
-它要爆炸了吗  - 我不知道
- Is it gonna blow up? - I don't know!

2213
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:24,770
一个炸弹在响  你不觉得不妙吗
A bomb starts beeping, that might signal a problem, you think?

2214
02:21:24,770 --> 02:21:27,970
我只是说它在很稳定地闪光
I'm just saying that it's a steady blinking light,

2215
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:29,380
也许是个计时器
which could be a timer of some kind.

2216
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:32,080
或者是定位信号
Unless it's signaling location.

2217
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:34,710
给谁的信号
To who?

2218
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,190
我们得向中央政府求助
We've got to call the central government for help!

2219
02:21:50,260 --> 02:21:52,160
擎天柱
Optimus prime.

2220
02:21:53,830 --> 02:21:56,030
回来吧
Come to me.

2221
02:23:14,780 --> 02:23:15,780
桥在那
There's the bridge.

2222
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:36,170
倒车  倒车
Back it up! Back it up!

2223
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:37,810
快快快  倒车  倒车
Go, go, go, go! Back up! Go back! Go back!

2224
02:23:38,770 --> 02:23:41,640
快  让开路  我看不到了
Move! Get out of the way. I can't see!

2225
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:43,280
-肖恩  开快点  -镇定
- Shane, drive faster! - Okay, just calm down.

2226
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:57,560
肖恩  小心
Shane, watch out!

2227
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,090
-去找掩护  -倒车  倒倒倒
- Get cover! - Back up! Back! Back up!

2228
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:09,100
汽车人  撤退
Autobots, fall back!

2229
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:15,910
-躲开  给我让路  -让路
- Come on, move! Out of my way! - Get out of the way!

2230
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:17,390
-小心  -撞吧  直接撞
- Look out! - Just hit them! Just hit them!

2231
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:38,860
那是个大磁铁
It's a big magnet!

2232
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:40,350
它会把金属吸上天  再丢下来
It's sucking up metal and dropping it!

2233
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:48,990
-开快点  -让开路
- Go faster! Go faster! - Get out of the way!

2234
02:24:49,140 --> 02:24:50,340
它过来了  过来了
It's coming! It's coming!

2235
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:52,110
它更近了
It's coming closer!

2236
02:24:52,110 --> 02:24:53,110
开快点  肖恩
Go faster, Shane!

2237
02:24:58,220 --> 02:24:59,690
-小心  -小心
- Watch out! - Look out!

2238
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:08,090
它向我们转回来了  向右打方向
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us! Hard right!

2239
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:09,100
向右打方向
Take a hard right!

2240
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,230
我的神啊
Oh, my God!

2241
02:25:28,410 --> 02:25:31,080
糟糕  是磁铁  下车
Oh, no. No, the magnet. Get out, get out!

2242
02:25:31,090 --> 02:25:32,250
快  快下车
Come on! Come here! Get out!

2243
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:37,020
不不不  我们升起来了  抓住炸弹
No, no, no! No, we're going up. Grab the bomb!

2244
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:38,720
帮我抓住炸弹
Help me grab the bomb!

2245
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:39,930
我解不开安全带了
I can't get the seat belt off!

2246
02:25:39,930 --> 02:25:41,390
拉我下来  抓住我
Pull me down! Catch me!

2247
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:43,060
我要升起来了  我要升起来了
I'm going up! I'm going up!

2248
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:44,760
抓住我  抓住我

解不开安全带
I can't get the belt off!

2252
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:53,410
我被卡住了  卡住了
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

2253
02:25:55,010 --> 02:25:56,410
抓紧炸弹  抓不住了
Hold the bomb! I can't hold on!

2254
02:25:56,410 --> 02:25:58,510
拉
Pull!

2255
02:25:58,510 --> 02:25:59,950
各位  我要被挤扁了
Guys, it's crushing me!

2256
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:12,920
车

2261
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,480
大黄蜂
Bumblebee!

2262
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:34,980

去个安全的地方
Go find someplace safe.

2265

我为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

2266
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,840
找掩护
Get cover!

2267
02:27:03,180 --> 02:27:04,180
凯德

把枪给我
Give me the gun.

2274
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:16,350
现在就剩你我了
It's you and me now!

2275
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:24,090
擎天柱现在是孤军奋战了
Look, Optimus is out there all alone.

2276
02:28:24,090 --> 02:28:25,520
什么  你帮不了他
What? You can't help him.

2277
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:26,990
我必须去  泰莎  他也为我们回来了

爸爸  别去  你会死掉的
Dad, no, you'll die!

2281
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:33,370

You gotta stay with Shane. You're gonna be okay.

2282

You're the best thing I ever made, Tess.

All right, we're gonna hold the line,

2295
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:47,370
那就截断这座桥
then block the bridge!

2296
02:30:16,370 --> 02:30:18,670
你看  做人就需要有耐心
You see, it takes patience to make a man.

2297
02:30:18,670 --> 02:30:20,640
耐心的守望  等待
The patience to watch and wait,

2298
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,210
静静地守护着我们
to protect all of us, quietly,

2299
02:30:22,210 --> 02:30:23,710
为了上帝为了祖国
for God and country,

2300
02:30:23,710 --> 02:30:24,950
哪怕无人认同也一样
without any recognition at all!

2301
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:32,050
凯德

外星人没有什么好坏之分  耶格
There are no good aliens! Or bad aliens, Yeager.

2303
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:38,360
只有敌我之分
It's just us and them.

2304
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:39,490
而你  选择了敌人那边
And you chose them.

2305

随时奉陪
Anytime.

2306
02:30:59,110 --> 02:31:02,180
你宁愿牺牲自己也要救一个人类
You saved the human instead of saving yourself?

2307
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:04,250
你简直是我们的耻辱
You bring shame upon us all.

2308
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:21,530
她从来就不听话  从来不听
She never listens. Never.

2309

2315
02:31:57,500 --> 02:31:58,740
而你们都得死

2316
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:09,750
开车开车

2320
02:32:47,390 --> 02:32:48,690
离开  你们快点离开这里
Get away, all of you!

2321
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:52,140
加油泰莎  加油泰莎  加油泰莎
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess.

2322
02:32:59,830 --> 02:33:00,830
开车
Drive!

2323
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:06,540
见到了我  你的末日就到了
You see my face, your life is done!

2324
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:07,580
快点快点快点
Come on, come on, come on!

2325
02:33:27,190 --> 02:33:29,230
至死不渝
Honor to the end.

2326
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:32,430
不后悔遇到我吧
You still happy we met?

2327
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:38,700
永远不会

快点

2329
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:51,480

Quickly! I'm setting off lockdown's grenade!

2330
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:52,480
抓紧了

2331
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:12,340
我们还会见面的  擎天柱
We shall meet again, Prime,

2332
02:34:12,340 --> 02:34:14,570
因为我回来了

2333
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:32,330
这次换我照顾你的感觉也不错
Kind of nice being your hero for a change.

2334

你一直都在照顾着我

2335
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:36,030
自始至终
All my life.

我们回去参加毕业舞会吧

2339

你没事了  孩子

2340
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,400
过来  你没事了  没事了
Come here, you're all right. You're all right.

2341
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:56,610
我们没有家了  爸爸
We don't have a home, dad.

2342
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:57,650
它被炸掉了
It blew up.

2343
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:04,360
我想这事我可以帮忙

2344

勇敢的战士们

2345
02:35:12,930 --> 02:35:14,630
你们自由了

随时愿意与你并肩作战  斯派克

2347
02:35:37,890 --> 02:35:39,320
你想我了吗
Did you miss me?

2348
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:41,060
没
No.

2349
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:46,700
这颗种子属于我们的创造者
This seed belongs to our creators,

2350
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,930
不管它们是谁
whoever they are.

2351
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:50,940
捉拿我的悬赏也还在
There remains a price on my head.

2352
02:35:52,100 --> 02:35:54,710
如果我留下你们都会有危险

2353
02:35:56,610 --> 02:35:59,440
我要把它藏起来  不让人发现
I shall take it where it can never be found.

2354
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:02,980
我们还会再见吗

2355
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:04,420
凯德·耶格

2356
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:06,120
我不知道

2357
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:09,550
但不论何时当你仰望星辰
But whenever you look to the stars,

2358
02:36:10,460 --> 02:36:12,460
请把其中一颗
think of one of them

2359
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:15,090
当作我的灵魂
as my soul.

2360
02:36:16,830 --> 02:36:19,460
守护这个家  汽车人
Defend this family, autobots,

2361
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
如同他们守护着你

2362
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:26,700
守护他们
Defend

2363
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:29,070
守护他们的未来
all they can be.

2364
02:36:36,780 --> 02:36:38,780
宇宙中有许多奥秘
There are mysteries to the universe

2365
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:42,390
本无答案
we were never meant to solve.

2366
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:45,860
但寻找本真和存在的意义
But who we are and why we are here

2367
02:36:47,130 --> 02:36:48,930
并不在其中
are not among them.

2368
02:36:49,630 --> 02:36:51,660
那些答案
Those answers

2369
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:53,660
从来都在我们的灵魂深处
we carry inside.

2370
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:57,740
这是我  擎天柱
I am Optimus Prime

2371
02:36:57,740 --> 02:37:01,010
对我的创造者说
and this message is to my creators:

2372
02:37:01,010 --> 02:37:03,610
别来找地球的麻烦
Leave planet earth alone.

2373
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:06,610
因为我
'Cause I'm coming

2374
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:07,850
会找你们的
for you.
