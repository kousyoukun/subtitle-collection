1
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:02,499
Red, I'm glad we got you outta there.

2
00:00:02,588 --> 00:00:05,754
With West Indian Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire...

3
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,047
...Boston's the best place for you.

4
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:11,469
Yeah. Well, we'll take it easy, huh, baby?

5
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:16,018
Shorty, I got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

6
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,723
- Sounds good. We'll lay low for a while.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:22,395
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll stake you, baby.

8
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:25,056
I got my band, I'm blowin' great sax.

9
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,394
Hell, Red, you ain't even heard us play yet!

10
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:29,527
Like every hustler, I was trapped.

11
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:33,944
Cats that hung together to find a little
security, find an answer, found nothing.

12
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,823
Cats that might have probed space,
or cured cancer...

13
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:39,784
I mean, West Indian Archie
might have been a mathematical genius.

14
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,496
We were all victims
of the American social order.

15
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:46,750
Until that time, there were three things
that I was always afraid of:

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,794
...ajob, a bust, andjail.

17
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:54,464
But I realised then that I wasn't afraid
of anything. I was an animal.

18
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:57,882
He don't look too good.

19
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:03,267
All right, we gonna rob this town blind.
Anybody want out, say so now.

20
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:07,770
Good. Good. OK, I set up a stake and
I got somebody to move the goods for us.

21
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,566
All we need now is a driver.
Any suggestions?

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,399
- How 'bout Rudy?
- Yeah, Rudy.

23
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,448
Who's Rudy?

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,039
I'm half-wop, I'm half-nigger,
I'm not afraid of nobody.

25
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:24,034
- That right? So what do you do?
- Name it, fella, I claim it.

26
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:26,797
Rudy does catering.
Rich joints on Beacon Hill.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,206
- Is that right?
- Tell him about Baldy.

28
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,051
- Baldy? (laughs)
- Yeah. Yeah.

29
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:36,430
Yeah, he's this old rich ofay motherfucker.
I give him a bath every Friday night.

30
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:40,352
Towel him off, talcum powder on him,
put him to bed.

31
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,022
- (laughter)
- Just like a baby. He gets his jollies off.

32
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,303
Yeah? And? So, what about him?

33
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:48,478
Guy's got jewellery,
he's got a coin collection, he's got china...

34
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,976
...he's got rugs...
- Ah. That might be all right.

35
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:54,986
Shit, I know this town, man.
I got my own fences!

36
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,071
(chuckles) Who is this guy? Huh?
Who put you in charge?

37
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:03,201
- You wanna be in charge, Rudy?
- I am in charge!

38
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,625
- You the head nigger in charge, huh?
- Yeah! I'm the head nigger in charge.

39
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,333
- Big-head nigger, that's what you are.
- (snorts)

40
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:13,748
I tell you what we do, Rudy.
Cos I'm a fair man.

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,639
And I like big-head niggers like you.

42
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:20,476
We'll flip for it.

43
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,053
We'll flip this.

44
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:26,560
(bullets clatter on table)

45
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:28,264
C'mon, Red...

46
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:31,232
She loves me.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,478
She loves me not.

48
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:36,154
She loves me.

49
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,823
She loves me not.

50
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,744
She loves me.

51
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:59,426
I'll flip first, Rudy.

52
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:04,809
- Red, cool it. Come on, baby.
- Head man in charge, right?

53
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:07,471
Put the gun down.

54
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,522
- (click)
- All right, we believe you.

55
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,731
We believe you.

56
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,816
Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For Chrissakes!

57
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:20,034
- It's your turn, Rudy.
- Quit fooling around. Come on, guys.

58
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,332
You don't wanna flip?
Let me show you how. I'll do it again.

59
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,290
- Christ, Red, don't!
- He doesn't know how. Gotta do it again.

60
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,587
- Red...
- Red, stop it!

61
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:37,711
Maybe you miss somethin'? You got
your eyes open? Look at me, Rudy.

62
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:40,970
- You don't have to do this, Red.
- Red!

63
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:45,599
- (click, Sophia gasps)
- (Shorty) That was really dumb.

64
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:50,057
- Your flip, baby. You wanna do it?
- That is so dumb, Red.

65
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,474
Nah, you don't, do you? I'll help you.

66
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:54,441
- Here.
- Red, don't!

67
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:59,145
Maybe we shoot
that little wop nose of yours off.

68
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:02,776
Or is that the nigger side?
Is that the wop side or the nigger side?

69
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,872
Is that wop or nigger?

70
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,499
- Ah, I guess that's the wop side.
- (Shorty) I'm not goin' to jail!

71
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:11,414
- How you doin', Rudy? One...
- Put the gun away! C'mon, this is enough.

72
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:14,338
- Two... Say goodbye, Rudy.
- (grunts)

73
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:17,716
- Huh?
- (choked sob)

74
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:22,013
(whispers) I think I heard Rudy say
something. What'd you say, Rudy?

75
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:24,635
Speak up. That way it's true.

76
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:29,979
- (click, woman yelps)
- Jesus Christ! When are you gonna stop?

77
00:04:30,814 --> 00:04:34,183
- I did two so I owe you two, right?
- (quietly) You got it.

78
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:37,063
- I got it? What'd you say?
- (very quietly) You got it.

79
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,197
(whispers) Rudy says I got it.

80
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,358
Rudy, don't you ever...

81
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:47,077
...try and cross someone
who ain't afraid to die. You hear me?

82
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:50,616
Now, all right.
Now this what we gonna do.

83
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,580
We gonna hit ol' Talcum Powder tonight.

84
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,162
My friend Rudy here's
gonna draw up the plans...

85
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:59,460
...everything that's in the house, right?

86
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:03,170
Peg, Sophia, you go out
and get those tools like I asked you.

87
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:06,181
We gonna hit tonight
on account of some of us...

88
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,592
...havin' high visibility during the daytime.
- (Sophia laughs)

89
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:14,060
It's OK with you, right, Rudy?

90
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,942
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

91
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,485
One big, happy family.

92
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,782
(whispers) I love you.

93
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,466
Psst! Red!

94
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:51,760
What happened to the bullet?
Did you palm that bullet?

95
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,396
What bullet?

96
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,722
The bullet!

97
00:05:56,608 --> 00:06:00,024
- (chuckles)
- You're crazy.

98
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,452
(whispers) Shorty!

99
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:25,386
- (clattering)
- Shh!

100
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,889
(whispers) Easy, Shorty. Easy.

101
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,812
- (thump)
- (whispers) Shorty!

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,499
- (rattling)
- Shh...

103
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,869
(snoring)

104
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:41,413
- My man, Red.
- Hm?

105
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,668
- My man.
- Huh.

106
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:47,511
Hey, when's Rudy due back?

107
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:51,714
* Louis Jordan:
Beans and Cornbread had a fight

108
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,098
Yeah, almost finished.

109
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:58,396
* Cornbread said "Now, that's all right
Meet me on the corner tomorrow night"

110
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,640
* I'll be ready...

111
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:04,066
Shit, them girls oughta be gettin' back
from casin' that rug joint.

112
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:06,441
They should be.

113
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,772
(laughs) Doin' a good job with you, man.

114
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:12,317
- Yeah. We killin' them, baby.
- We're killin' them.

115
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:16,528
- They don't know what's hittin' them.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

116
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,746
Lemme get...
Little work back in this kitchen.

117
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,835
- You gettin' the kitchen, huh?
- Yeah, that's where the naps are.

118
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,542
Yeah, well, if you can't take the heat,
get on out the kitchen.

119
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:27,419
- Let me get these naps.
- (grunts)

120
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,881
- All right, let's go to the sink.
- Good.

121
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,342
* That's what Beans told Cornbread

122
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:35,432
Come on, Shorty, man,
it's startin' to heat up a little bit.

123
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:36,976
- It's burnin'?
- Yeah. It's all right.

124
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,970
All right.

125
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,139
Put your head down.

126
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,390
- * Beans and Cornbread had a fight
- C'mon, man.

127
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,523
- * Beans grabbed Cornbread by the toe
- Huh?

128
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:47,769
* Beans said "Cornbread, let me go"

129
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:52,116
* Cornbread said "I'll lay you low
I'm gonna fight you, you so-and-so"

130
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,161
- * Meet me on the corner
- Shit is startin' to sting! Get out the way.

131
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,449
*... on the corner tomorrow night!
That's what Beans said to Cornbread!

132
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,992
- Burnin'?
- Hell, yeah, it's burnin'!

133
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:07,373
* I'm gonna beat the devil outta you!
Whoo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo!

134
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,672
Goddamn it!

135
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:11,506
(moans) Oh!

136
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,635
Oh! Ah! Ah!

137
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,181
Oh!

138
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:18,101
Hey, nigger!
Take your head outta the shit bowl!

139
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:19,216
That's it! Get up slowly!

140
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:22,807
Hey! Watch it! No funny business, now!

141
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:26,055
Red, the jig is up.

142
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,938
The average first offender
gets two years for burglary.

143
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,860
We were all first offenders,
so that's what Sophia and Peg drew.

144
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:34,985
Two years in the women's reformatory
at Framingham.

145
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,536
But our crime wasn't burglary.

146
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,369
It was sleeping with white girls.
They threw the book at us.

147
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:43,494
Burglary, count one: Eight to ten years.

148
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:46,124
Count two: Eight to ten years.

149
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:48,882
- Count three: Eight to ten years.
- (laughs)

150
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,255
- Count four: Eight to ten years.
- (chuckles)

151
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:53,633

159
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:18,612
- Fourteen counts of eight to ten years.
- All the sentences to run concurrently.

160
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:21,242
(chuckles) Shorty thought he had hit us
with over 100 years...

161
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,371
...until I explained
what "concurrently" meant.

162
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,413
It meant a minimum sentence
often years'hard labour...

163
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:29,125
...at the Charlestown State Prison.

164
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:33,131

169
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,810
One secure!

170

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,070
- Lock three!

176

178
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,541
Four secure!

179
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:15,503
- Crichlow!
- A599-1301!

180
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,219
- Close five!
- Comin' down!

181
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:20,802
- Look at Satan.
- I see him.

182
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:23,301
He 'bout to bust.

183
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:26,229
He not gonna bust.
He wouldn't give 'em the pleasure.

184
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:29,812
- (door slams)
- Little!

185
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:34,359
- State your number.
- Little!

186
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:36,982
- What?
- Give him a break, Barnes!

187
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:40,692
- He's a new fish.
- OK, I'll give him a break.

188
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,119
- Now state your number, Little.
- I forgot it.

189
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,116
- State it.
- I forgot it!

190
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,412
Can't you read it right there, boy?
There! Can't you read, boy?

191
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:51,667
Fuck you!

192
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:56,417
- I'll teach you a lesson, goddammit!
- How you gonna get away from this?

193
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,885
Move it up! Move it up!

194
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,805
I forgot it! I forgot it!

195
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,804
- I forgot it! (howls)
- Get him in here and shut it!

196
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,636
(whispers)
They ain't gonna break me down.

197
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:12,605
Well, that's just the kind of nigger I am.
They' ain't gonna break me down.

198
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:16,607
Now I'm situatin'...
I'm in this situation and I'm gettin' out.

199
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:19,403
(laughs) Anything come round,
well, I'm strong.

200
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:21,947
- I'm strong...
- Time's up, Little!

201
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,741
Now state your number!

202
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:27,738
(water drips)

203
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,873
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

204
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,292
(footsteps)

205
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:36,796
Water!

206
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,591
Water!

207
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,262
(clatter)

208
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:53,644
(footsteps, knock at door)

209
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,228
You want a smoke?

210
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:07,702
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son.

211
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,750
(laughs) A friend?

212
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,707
(voice cracks) Uh?

213
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:15,661
He's a friend, huh, Chappy? Well,
if he's such a friend, where is he, huh?

214
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:18,425
What he done for me?
A friend we have in Je...

215
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,756
Yeah, I tell you what you do, Chap.
You tell him to call me!

216
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:25,219
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is, huh?

217
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,514
Solitary Two, 2607!

218
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,973
(roars)
What he done for me, Chappy, huh?

219
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:33,810
Where is he every time I need him, huh?
You tell me that!

220
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,438
Where is this Jesus?
I'll tell you where he is!

221
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,812
He's out with the police, Chaplain!
Yeah, I'll straighten him out!

222
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:43,731
What has he done for me?
He ain't done nothin' for me!

223
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,657
Ain't done nothin' for me. (exhales)

224
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:51,744
(mutters) "What a friend we have
in Jesus(!)" Jesus can kiss my ass!

225
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:55,084
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass!
How 'bout that? Tell him that!

226
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,001
(hoarse sob)

227
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:08,473
(cries softly)

228
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:12,141
(sobs)

229
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,984
(growls)

230
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:24,980
(whimpers and growls)

231
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:31,953
(hoarse) Haah! Haaah! Aaah!

232
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,951
Aaaaah!

233
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:36,284
Aaaaaaah!

234
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:42,796
(howls)

235
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,807
Little!

236
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,802
Little!

237
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,934
State your number, Little!

238
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,478
C'mon, state it!

239
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,269
- (whispers) A22...
- What?

240
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,650
A228.

241
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,398
Come on! (grunts)

242
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,706
(door slams)

243
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,499
I know how you feel.
Like you wanna lay down and die.

244
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:29,260
I brought you something.

245
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:32,384
(hoarse) Yeah, well,
I don't need any more favours from you.

246
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:34,884
It's nutmeg. Put it in the water.

247
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,478
You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

248
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:41,270
It's not cocaine, but it'll help some.

249
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,369
Drink it slow. This stuff is strong.

250
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,119
(coughs)

251
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,126
(coughs) So what's your hype, huh?

252
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:03,125
I can show you how to get out of prison.
And it's no hype.

253
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:06,299
Yeah, well, talk, daddy-o. I'm listenin'.

254
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,552
- Hey, this ain't bad. You got some more?
- That's the last fix I'm givin' you.

255
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,092
- So what you give it to me for, then, huh?
- Because you needed it.

256
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:18,056
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

257
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:21,400
(snorts) Nigger, get on outta my face.

258
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:24,983
I think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

259
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,146
But why the hell don't you use it?

260
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,482
You can't bust out of here...

261
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,864
...like they do in the movies.

262
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:36,618
- Even if you get out, you're still in prison.
- Well, you ain't lyin' there.

263
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:40,621
You go bustin' your fist against
a stone wall, you're not usin' your brain!

264
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,917
That's what the white man
wants you to do!

265
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:46,671
Look at you!
Puttin' all that poison in your hair.

266
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,047
I think you've been in prison too long,
my man...

267
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,176
...because everybody
on the outside conks.

268
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:53,635
Why? Why does everybody
on the outside conk?

269
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:56,131
Cos they don't want a nappy head,
like...

270
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:59,144
Like what? Like me? Like a nigger?

271
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,061
Why don't you wanna look like
what you are?

272
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,985
What makes you ashamed
of bein' black?

273
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:10,447
Lemme tell you somethin',
I'm not ashamed of bein' anything.

274
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,608
You better get your hands off me.
I got to wash this out.

275
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,949
- Let it burn!
- Nigger, get your hands off of me!

276
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,993
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself!

277
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:25,003
Puttin' that poison in your hair,
in your body, tryin' to be white!

278
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:29,081
(laughs) I don't wanna hear all this shit.

279
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:31,382
I thought you was smart.

280
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,005
But you just another of those cats struttin'
down the avenue in your clown suit...

281
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,637
...with all that mess on you,
lookin' like a monkey!

282
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:41,806
The white man sees you and laughs,
because he knows you ain't white!

283
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:46,025
- Man, who are you?
- No. The question is, who are you?

284
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:50,608
Well, I'll tell you.
You are lost in the darkness.

285
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,738
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

286
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:58,746
- Who?
- Elijah Muhammad...

287
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,369
...can get you out of prison.

288
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,956
Out of the prison of your mind.

289
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,291
But maybe all you want is another fix.

290
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,097
(prisoners talk quietly)

291
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:26,519
And then you get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

292
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:30,060
- That's right.
- You stop thinking, acting for yourself.

293
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:34,199
You couldn't scrounge
three squares a day on the outside.

294
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:37,403
So you let them feed you.
Give you dominoes to play with.

295
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,285
- Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
- Let's go! Cut the sermon!

296
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:45,157
He blows his whistle, and you sit!
You stand, you grab, gobble...

297
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:47,161
File out! Sleep!

298
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:52,082
- Sing out your number, loud as you can!
- I told you to knock it off, Baines.

299
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:55,756
Now, are you gonna take yard?

300
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,596
I'm stayin'.

301
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:01,177
Uh, yeah, me, too.

302
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,321
What're you sniffin' around for?
I told you I gave you your last fix.

303
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,492
What's your angle, nigger? Hm?

304
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:27,077
Nigger? Who's wearing the conk(?)

305
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:31,498
You the only cat in this prison I done seen
that act the way you do.

306
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,840
You ain't even afraid of talking like that
in front of them guards or nothin'.

307
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:39,090
- What more can he do to me?
- Hm.

308
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,350
I mean, you don't cuss none.

309
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,841
You don't talk that
"Whatcha know, daddy" jive.

310
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:47,139
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

311
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:50,393
(chuckles)

312
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,149
Yeah.

313
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:56,107
Yeah, I know you got an angle,
some kinda way.

314
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,238
Don't con me.

315
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,783
Don't con me, and don't try.

316
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,788
Hey.

317
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:07,661
Just offerin' you a cigarette, my man.
Ain't no big deal.

318
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,630
I read, study.

319
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:19,051
The first thing a black man must have
is respect for himself.

320
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:24,298
Respect his body and his mind. Quit takin'
the white man's poisons into his body.

321
00:20:24,393 --> 00:20:26,765
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor.

322
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,309
His white woman. His pork.

323
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:31,267
Pork?

324
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,398
Hm.

325
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:37,479
Yeah, my mama used to say that,
"Don't eat no pork."

326
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:41,784
Well, your mama was right.
Cos that pig is a filthy beast.

327
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,654
Part rat, part cat. And the rest is dog.

328
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:50,706
All right, pull my coat on this now.
What happen if you give all that up?

329
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:54,495
I mean, the pork and... You get sick
and then you get a medical or somethin'?

330
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,626
Like when I was on the outside,
I ran this hustle.

331
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:01,758
- I tried to act like...
- I'm tellin' you God's words, not no hustle.

332
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,848
And I'm gonna tell you, God is black.

333
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:07,893
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

334
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:10,350
Everything the white man taught you,
you accepted.

335
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:13,356
He taught you you were a black heathen,
you believed him.

336
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:17,487
He taught you to worship a blond,
blue-eyed Jesus with white skin...

337
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:19,694
...and you believed him.

338
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:22,736
He taught you that black was a curse,
and you believe that.

339
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:25,448
- Did you look up "black" in a dictionary?
- For what?

340
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:27,993
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't part of some con?

341
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,706
What the hell for, man?

342
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:33,585
(sighs) Come with me.

343
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,040
"Black."

344
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:41,549
"Destitute of light. Devoid of colour."

345
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:46,134
"Enveloped in darkness;
hence, utterly dismal or gloomy;...

346
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,182
...as, the future looked black."

347
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,261
Pretty good with them words, ain't you?

348
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,809
"Soiled with dirt, foul."

349
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:55,147
"Sullen, hostile."

350
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:57,813
"Forbidding; as, a black day."

351
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:01,989
"Foully or outrageously wicked;...

352
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:03,698
...as, black cruelty."

353
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:07,367
"Indicating disgrace,
dishonour, or culpability."

354
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:09,530
And there's others.

355
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:12,079
Blackmail, blackball, blackguard.

356
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:15,702
- Hmm, well, that's somethin', all right.
- Let's look up "white".

357
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:21,214
Here.

358
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:23,508
Read.

359
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:29,760
"White: Of the colour of pure snow;...

360
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,595
...reflecting all the rays of the spectrum."

361
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:35,392
"The opposite of black."

362
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:42,355
Um..."Free from spot or blemish."

363
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:47,198
"Innocent. Pure."

364
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:50,952
Huh!

365
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,709
Isn't this somethin'? "Without evil intent."

366
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,164
"Harmless. Honest."

367
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:59,124
"Square-dealing and honourable."
Wait a minute. But this...

368
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:02,548
This was written by white folks,
though, right? This is a white folks' book.

369
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:05,386
- This sure ain't no black man's book.
- So what we readin' this one for?

370
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:08,258
Because the truth is lying there
if you read behind the words.

371
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:13,473
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

372
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:16,060
Yeah?

373
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:19,271
All right, but I mean,
there's a whole lotta words in here.

374
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,894
- I mean...
- Here. We'll start at the beginning.

375
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,906
We'll look 'em up, write 'em down
and find out what they mean.

376
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:30,119
Here. Page one. The first word: Aardvark.

377
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,289
"Aardvark: Earth pig."

378
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:38,416
"African ant-eating mammal."

379
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:41,495
"Abacus: A Chinese...

380
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:44,624
...calculating instrument."

381
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:51,429
"Abaddon:
The place of the lost in... Sh... eol...

382
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:52,975
...the bottomless pit."

383
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:57,936
If you take one step toward Allah,
He will take two steps toward you.

384
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:02,018
(footsteps, coughing)

385
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,197
- Lights out!
- (bell rings)

386
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:11,902
Why you readin' them books?
You gonna be here longer than me.

387
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,035
Lights out!

388
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,583
(prisoner) Might as well put the book
down, seein' the light's out.

389
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,912
He gonna go blind.

390
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:31,340
(shouting)

391
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,387
(shouting, applause)

392
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:41,559
- (team) Oh, yeah!
- C'mon, Pete!

393
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,483
(chuckles)
Boy'll wear out a baseball, won't he?

394
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:49,699
- Hey, Chuck! What's the score, my man?
- Ten to one! We're murderin' them!

395
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:51,194
Didn't you hear?

396
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,159
No, what happened?

397
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:54,739
The Brooklyn Dodgers
brought up Jackie Robinson.

398
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,823
We're poundin' the hell out of 'em,
celebratin'!

399
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:59,074
Yeah, that's all right!

400
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:02,504
Sure. White man throw us a bone...

401
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:06,454
...and we are supposed to forget

402
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:11,675
Yeah, but a nigger... a Negro playin' in
the big leagues, that's somethin', ain't it?

403
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:15,222
I told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

404
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:18,769
They let us sing and dance and smile.

405
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:21,897
And then they let
one so-called Negro into the majors.

406
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:24,687
That doesn't cancel out
the greatest crime in history.

407
00:25:24,777 --> 00:25:30,067
When that crafty blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains, 100 million of us...

408
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:33,028
...broke up our families, tortured us...

409
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:37,324
...cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history.

410
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,364
Let me tell you about black history.

411
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,702
We are the original man.

412
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:47,374
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled...

413
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:50,337
...and there wasn't a white face anywhere.

414
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,514
But they teach us that we lived in caves
and swung from trees.

415
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:56,135
That's a lie. Black men never did that.

416
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:58,680
We were a race of kings...

417
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:01,853
...when the white man crawled around
on all fours over the hills of Europe.

418
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:04,608
Do they know who they are?

419
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:08,811
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

420
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:09,853
Malcolm Little.

421
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:14,194
No. That's the name of the slave masters
who owned your family.

422
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,911
You don't even know who you are.
You're nothing. Less than nothing.

423
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:22,121
Who are you?

424
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:27,334
Look, I ain't... Shit.

425
00:26:30,843 --> 00:26:33,512
All right, I ain't Malcolm Little, I ain't Red...

426
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:36,217
...I damn sure ain't Satan.
- That's right. So who are you?

427
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:43,183
- I don't know.
- We are a nation.

428
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:45,607
The tribe of Shabazz...

429
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:49,522
...lost in this wilderness
called North America.

430
00:26:56,285 --> 00:26:58,324
Tribe of Shabazz.

431
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:01,081
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

432
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:03,834
...a black man named Elijah Muhammad.

433
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:07,500
He reveals to us
the true knowledge about ourselves.

434
00:27:07,588 --> 00:27:11,799
He teaches us that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

435
00:27:11,884 --> 00:27:14,007
...is righteousness.

436
00:27:14,094 --> 00:27:16,419
So if the nature of the black man
is righteousness, Malcolm...

437
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:19,431
Then the true nature of the white man
is wickedness.

438
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:21,343
I knew you'd get it.

439
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:25,053
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us that the white man is a devil.

440
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:27,685
Hm. I sure met some in my life.

441
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:33,692
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

442
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:38,321
He teaches us
that allwhite men are devils.

443
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:40,943
Look, have you ever known
a good white man?

444
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:43,529
I mean, think back in all your life.

445
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:46,079
Have you ever met one who wasn't evil?

446
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:58,008
(Baines) The body is a sacred temple.
It must be purified.

447
00:28:00,182 --> 00:28:03,136
I will not touch the white man's poison...

448
00:28:03,227 --> 00:28:05,932
...his drugs, his liquor...

449
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,393
...his swine, his... women.

450
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:16,190
A Muslim must be strikingly upright,
an outstanding example...

451
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:20,701
...so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

452
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:25,288
I will not commit adultery or fornication.

453
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:30,162
I will not lie, cheat or steal.

454
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,675
But the key to Islam is submission.

455
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,594
That is why, five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

456
00:28:42,683 --> 00:28:45,304
...to bend our knees in submission.

457
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:51,525
I can't do that, Brother Baines.

458
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:55,523
For lost-founds to bend their knees,
to admit their guilt...

459
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:58,442
...to implore Allah's forgiveness...

460
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,105
...is the hardest thing on earth.

461
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:09,126
The hardest, and the greatest.

462
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,710
I don't know what I would say to Allah.

463
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:20,218
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?

464
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:24,548
Yes, when I was, uh...

465
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:27,845
...when I was picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

466
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,976
Tell Allah that.

467
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:44,988
You can grovel and crawl for sin,
but not to save your soul?

468
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,202
Pick the lock, Malcolm. Pick it.

469
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:50,079
Brother, I want to.

470
00:29:53,295 --> 00:29:55,537
God knows, I want to.

471
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,014
I received a letter that day
from The Honourable Elijah Muhammad.

472
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:15,560
The dear Holy Apostle wrote to me,
a nobody, ajunkie, a pimp and a convict.

473
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:18,818
(Elijah Muhammad)
I have come to give you...

474
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:22,818
...something which can neverbe
taken away from you.

475
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:27,404
I bring to you a sense of your own worth.

476
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:31,625
The word of one human being.

477
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,199
The knowledge of self.

478
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:38,624
It was like a blinding light, and I became
aware that he was in the room with me.

479
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:41,214
He wore a dark suit, and on his face...

480
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:46,129
...I saw a wisdom andpain so old and deep
that I could scarcely look at him.

481
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:49,765
But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was right there with me.

482
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,100
I tell you...

483
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:56,855
...the most dangerous creation
in the world...

484
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,982
...in any society...

485
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:02,269
...is the man with nothing to lose.

486
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:07,526
You do not need ten such men
to change the world.

487
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:10,613
One will do.

488
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:14,369
The earth belongs to us.

489
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,286
The black man.

490
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:21,420
And whatever is around it,
or on it, or in it...

491
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,299
...belongs to us.

492
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:27,922
And then, as suddenly as he came,
he was gone.

493
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:31,638
And then I could do it.

494
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:39,647
We are taught that Paul, on the road
to Damascus, heard the voice of Christ.

495
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:42,696
He was so smitten by the truth
that he fell from his horse.

496
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:47,026
Now, I don't liken myself to Paul,
but I do understand.

497
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,365
- You see, it happened to me.
- Aameen.

498
00:31:53,123 --> 00:31:55,199
(Baines) Dear Brother Malcolm...

499
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:58,246
...I am back in the bosom of Islam.
Praise Allah.

500
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:01,338
We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.

501
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:05,172
My wife Lorraine and my son Sidney join
me in saying that when you come out...

502
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,965
...which will not be too long,
come straight to us.

503
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:10,094
Next!

504
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:17,679
What'll it be, Little?

505
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,021
Take it all off.

506
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:24,023
- Oh, gettin' rid of that conk, huh?
- Yes, sir.

507
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:28,449
You write thanking me.
(chuckles) Don't thank me.

508
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:31,370
Thank Allah. He did it all.

509
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:36,204
(Malcolm) Dear Brother Baines...

510
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,162
...please thank The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad for the money...

511
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:43,203
...and tell him I have not written him
because I have not yet proven myself.

512
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:46,169
- What is this?
- But I have shared his teachings...

513
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,833
...with some of my old running buddies
back in Harlem...

514
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:52,013
...and with my main man Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.

515
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,926
He's gone nuts.

516
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:58,514
"Dear brothers, I thank you
for your endeared time and concern."

517
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:03,349
"All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad."

518
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,571
"I wrote the Mayor, the Governor
and the President...

519
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,905
...but for some reason,
I haven't heard from them."

520
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:10,988
Hm.

521
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,828
(Malcolm) Please tell The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad...

522
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:17,827
...that I have dedicated my life to telling
the white devil the truth to his face.

523
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:20,834
I greet you with the ancient words
of peace: As salaam alaikum.

524
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:22,330
Wa-alaikum salaam.

525
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:25,754
Oh. PS: I've finally copied out
the entire dictionary.

526
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:30,427
I think the brother is coming along.

527
00:33:30,888 --> 00:33:31,967
(metal door slams)

528
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:35,259
"And the thief
cometh not but for to steal...

529
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:37,427
...and to kill...

530
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,928
...and to destroy."

531
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:44,102
"But I am come,
that they might have life...

532
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:49,018
...and that they might have it
more abundantly."

533
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:51,858
St John 10. Verse 10.

534
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,358
Are there any questions?

535
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,702
Hey, watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

536
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:05,915
I can see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

537
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:07,381
Satan has a question.

538
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:11,333
(laughs) Yes, sir, Chaplain Gill.
But since neither one of us are God...

539
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:14,382
...neither one of us is in any position
to say who's good and who's evil.

540
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:15,884
Just ask your question.

541
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:18,263
We were discussing the disciples.
What colour were they?

542
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:22,018
Well, I don't think...

543
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:24,229
...we know that for certain.

544
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:26,475
- But they were Hebrews.
- That's right.

545
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:28,775
As was Jesus. Jesus was also a Hebrew.

546
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:33,116
- Just ask your question.
- What colour were the original Hebrews?

547
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,783
I have told you
that we don't know that for certain.

548
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,082
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

549
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:44,583
Just, er, just a moment. Just a moment.

550
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:47,754
God is white. Isn't it obvious?

551
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,757
That is obvious,
but it's not obvious that God is white.

552
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,001
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

553
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:55,551
...that Jesus did not have
blond hair and blue eyes.

554
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,798
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us that the images of Jesus...

555
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:01,142
...that are on prison walls and churches
throughout the world...

556
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:04,644
...are not historically correct,
because history teaches us...

557
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:08,314
...that Jesus was born in a region
where the people had colour.

558
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:11,403
There is proof in the very Bible
that you ask us to read...

559
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,275
...in Revelations, first chapter,
verse 14 and 15...

560
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:18,234
...that Jesus had hair like wool
and feet the colour of brass.

561
00:35:18,328 --> 00:35:20,998
- Now, just... just what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

562
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:23,572
I'm proving to you that Jesus was not...

563
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,787
...and I might quote one of our Indian
brothers, he was not a paleface.

564
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,918
(prisoners whisper and chuckle)

565
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:30,500
- A-ha.
- Amen.

566
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,423
(Chaplain) Isn't that interesting?

567
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,084
(bell rings)

568
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:38,097
Brother Malcolm!

569
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,724
Brother Malcolm!

570
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:43,343
He's waiting for you.

571
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:29,646
My son.

572
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:34,816
You have been a thief...

573
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:39,282
...a drug dealer, and a... and a hustler...

574
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:43,662
...and the world is still full of temptation.

575
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,919
When God spoke to the devil
about how faithful Job was...

576
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:57,882
...the devil argued that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

577
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,259
...that kept him pure.

578
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:04,381
Fact about it, the devil said
"Remove that hedge...

579
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:07,217
...and he will curse his Maker."

580
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,687
Well, Malcolm...

581
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:14,361
...your hedge has been removed.

582
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:20,073
...and I believe...

583
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:24,700
...you will remain faithful.

584
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,453
Yes, sir.

585
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:34,081
Thank you, sister. Brother Sidney, now
how many of these should we turn out?

586
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:35,833
- 500.
- Make it 1,000.

587
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:36,920
Yes, sir.

588
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:39,500
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

589
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:41,634
- As salaam alaikum, brother.
- Wa-alaikum salaam.

590
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:45,720
Brother Earl is dedicated.
We need good men like him.

591
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:49,185
I'm a willing servant
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad.

592
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:51,643
OK, brothers, let's keep it busy.

593
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:54,649
Take a real good look at where you live!
Not just where you live...

594
00:37:54,735 --> 00:37:58,068
...but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives!

595
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:01,524
Cos I don't want you to think
you just a bad luck accident!

596
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:04,737
Then I want you go downtown,
over to Central Park West...

597
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:06,868
...and take a good look at how he lives!
(fades off)

598
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:10,574
Look at how you live and how he lives!

599
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:13,918
You've never seen
a Booker T Washington linguini store!

600
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:16,080
You never went to a Jewish community...

601
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:19,008
...and seen no Frederick Douglass
delicatessen!

602
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:22,343
Why is everybody making money but us?

603
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,181
(other speaker) Dick, Jane and Spot(!)

604
00:38:25,265 --> 00:38:28,560
The only thing that's black in the book
is the spot on the back of the dog's back!

605
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,929
It's time for us to use our dollars...

606
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,644
We can do what everyone else can do!

607
00:38:34,733 --> 00:38:38,897
If we become producers, and if we
become the masters of our own destiny...

608
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:42,154
...we can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else!

609
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,364
But where are our clothing stores?

610
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:48,366
We can get milk from cows like anyone
else! But where are our grocery stores?

611
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:52,535
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

612
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:55,461
The only thing they respect is our dollars!

613
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:58,381
The only thing they respect
is the wealth that we give them!

614
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,505
Where's that freedom
that you and I are supposed to have?

615
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:02,632
The Statue of Liberty's standin' like this...

616
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,171
...and for you and I, it might as well be
sayin' "Stop! Don't come no further!"

617
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:08,934
This is what it be sayin'!
"Don't come no further!"

618
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:10,013
That's right!

619
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:14,100
So what I want you to do, brothers and
sisters, is come on down to the temple.

620
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:17,476
Oh! I'm so surprised! I'm so surprised!

621
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:20,652
Y'all been in church two hours and
you're expectin' to see heaven out here...

622
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:23,229
...and there ain't no heaven!
You're still right here on earth!

623
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:26,324
Sister, why don't you come on down
to the temple at two o'clock?

624
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,449
Hear the truth! Hear the black man's truth!

625
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,499
No, you can't deny it! You've been on your
knees the last two hours, haven't you...

626
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:35,204
...beggin' some God
to help you in the hereafter.

627
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:38,793
But the hereafter's right now, brother!
The hereafter is here and now!

628
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:41,798
Let me... Let me talk to you for one
second, brother. Now, listen to me.

629
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:45,003
Now, I know you a smart man. I can tell.
You're a wise man. You look good.

630
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:48,760
Now, you're in here in this church
every day, prayin' to this God.

631
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:51,138
I'm tellin' you,
these so-called white Christians...

632
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:53,848
...they're hangin' our black Christians
from trees, brother!

633
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:57,638
The man hates you! He says he loves you,
but he doesn't do anything for you!

634
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:59,772
He tells you to foam at the mouth...

635
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,565
...to faint and sing and shout,
and hope for something in the hereafter.

636
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:05,324
We can have it right now, brother.
We can have it right now.

637
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,447
- Come on down. As salaam alaikum.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

638
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:09,776
Do you know what that means, brother?
"Peace be unto you."

639
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,037
My beautiful black sisters,
can I have a moment of your time?

640
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,994
Don't be ashamed when I call you black.

641
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:18,789
Cos you're beautiful. Black is beautiful.

642
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:22,746
You don't have to come here every day
beggin' these folks for a job!

643
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:25,878
Why, you can wash their clothes for 'em,
scrub their floors...

644
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,887
...rock their little brats to sleep
for the rest of your life!

645
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:31,131
You'll still end up poor
and without anything.

646
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:33,348
And yet you're here on the auction block!

647
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:36,685
They're examining you
like a chicken, or a horse, or a slave!

648
00:40:36,772 --> 00:40:41,897
You see this here? This is who you are.
Beautiful. Your beautiful black selves.

649
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:44,655
With pride, and dignity. In fact...

650
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:49,900
Uh... I'd also expect you
to work one Saturday every month...

651
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:52,152
...and occasionally into the evening.
I hope my...

652
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:00,290
You see, these are the questions!

653
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:03,582
The questions you and I have to ask.
How did we get this mind?

654
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:07,588
You're not an American. You're an African
who happens to be an American.

655
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:09,717
You have to understand the difference.

656
00:41:09,805 --> 00:41:13,340
We didn't come over on the Nina, the
Pinta and the... and the Whatchamacallit!

657
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:17,301
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock!
Plymouth Rock landed on us!

658
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,221
Landed right on top of us!

659
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:23,773
Shorty?

660
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:26,482
Is that you, brother?

661
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:31,608
Praise be to Allah. That's what I'm talking
about, the slave mentality, the slave mind.

662
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:34,027
This brother and I, we had the slave mind.

663
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:38,450
We used to rob together, sleep with white
women. We even went to prison together.

664
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,618
Now, don't be surprised
when I say we went to prison...

665
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:43,914
...cos some of y'all still in prison.
Prisons of your mind.

666
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:46,331
Stand up, brother. C'mon.

667
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:50,802
(chuckles) The brother's a little shy.
Come on, brother! Give me a hug.

668
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,174
Yeah!

669
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,558
That's all right, brother. That's all right.

670
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,683
He's still got his hair fried.
That's all right, though.

671
00:41:58,771 --> 00:42:01,475
- That's the slave mind.
- (laughter)

672
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,981
I gotta hand it to you, Red,
best preacher hype I ever did hear.

673
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:06,942
No hype, brother. It's the truth.

674
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:09,187
Why don't you come on back down
to the temple and hear some more?

675
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:12,531
- Man, I can't pay that shit no mind.
- Brother, you need to pay it all your mind.

676
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:15,868
- What mind you have left.
- Take it easy, greasy. This is me. Shorty!

677
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:19,113
Let's go around the corner. (sniffs)

678
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:23,119
No, sir. Not any more.
I've been clean for eight years, brother.

679
00:42:23,212 --> 00:42:24,955
- Eight years?
- Eight years.

680
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:27,086
You are somethin', homey.

681
00:42:27,174 --> 00:42:29,297
My trouble is I love pig's feet
and white women too much.

682
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:31,757
- (laughs)
- I damn sure can't be no Muslim!

683
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:35,173
That's cos you're lost, brother.
That's cos you're lost.

684
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:38,764
But we can find you.

685
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:46,442
- So what d'you hear about the old gang?
- Heard about Sammy?

686
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:51,071
Dead. Knocked overin a bed with a chick

687
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:54,319
Had 25 grand in his pocket also.

688
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,533
Guess it was his lucky number(!)

689
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,700
What about, uh...
What was that brother's name?

690
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:03,543
Cadillac? Gone, too?

691
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:08,040
Hooked on heroin. Been in and out
of Lexington five orsix times.

692
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:11,714
- Sophia?
- Still happily married to that rich ofay.

693
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:14,507
- She married him?
- She married him.

694
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:17,087
- Went for the money.
- The money.

695
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:19,720
Thank you, honey.

696
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,059
I haven't seen West Indian Archie.

697
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,182
Grapevine says he lives in the Bronx...

698
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:27,397
...if you want to call that livin '.

699
00:43:27,484 --> 00:43:31,612
- Shorty, it's been good seein'you.
- Same here, Red.

700
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:40,946
- You in?
- (slurs) Get the hell away from me.

701
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,079
Bitch!

702
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:48,118
- (knock at door)
- I'll pay you tomorrow!

703
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:03,803
How you doing, Archie?

704
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,638
My man Red.

705
00:44:08,817 --> 00:44:10,857
C'mere, man.

706
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,278
No, don't get up. It's all right.

707
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:23,244
(whispers) Yes.

708
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:26,956
Is...

709
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,210
...really you, Red?

710
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,213
Yes, it's me.

711
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:39,010
I came to, uh...

712
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:41,639
...just to thank you.

713
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:44,593
Thank you for saving my life.

714
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:48,138
When I think back to when
we were on the streets of Harlem...

715
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:52,479
...tryin' to gun each other down...
- I wasn't gonna shoot you, man.

716
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:55,739
It was...

717
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,155
...just my rep. Y'know?

718
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,158
All I had was my rep.

719
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,080
But now...

720
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:09,916
...you tell me this.

721
00:45:10,379 --> 00:45:13,131
You didn't really have that number?

722
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:17,250
I don't know, Archie, I...

723
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:20,594
I really don't even remember.
That's not even important.

724
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:23,635
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

725
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:26,805
Yeah. Y'know, I have some angles...

726
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:31,348
...ain't been figured yet.

727
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:34,563
(grunts)

728
00:45:35,154 --> 00:45:37,609
Archie, here. Hang on.

729
00:45:37,698 --> 00:45:39,940
- (grunts)
- It's all right.

730
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:48,788
Help me with my arm. (exhales heavily)

731
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:52,660
- All right.
- Have to exercise my arm.

732
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:54,836
Here?

733
00:45:56,091 --> 00:45:58,131
Yeah.

734
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,764
- That's better?
- Yeah. It feels good.

735
00:46:02,848 --> 00:46:04,675
Good.

736
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:08,932
- Yes, right here!
- Sweetness, I got somethin' for you, baby!

737
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:10,895
What happened to our women?

738
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:15,193
They could have been doctors,
or lawyers, or teachers, or mothers?

739
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:17,234
Who's going to raise our children?

740
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,732
What happened to ourmen?

741
00:46:18,822 --> 00:46:23,243
They could have been mathematicians,
electricians orphysicians.

742
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:25,485
What happened to 'em?
What's the little boy gonna do...

743
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:28,948
...when he's lookin' for his father
and his father's downtown injail?

744
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,746
What's the little girl gonna do
when she's lookin' for her mother...

745
00:46:31,835 --> 00:46:34,505
...and she's selling herself on the street?
- Laura! Laura, wait up for me!

746
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:38,455
No, I'm telling you that devil
has made dead souls out of you and I!

747
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,958
- You're dead! You're dead spirits!
- Take the money.

748
00:46:41,053 --> 00:46:42,221
Put your money away.

749
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:43,679
You're dead
to the knowledge of yourself!

750
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:45,803
You're dead
to the knowledge of your people...

751
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:47,931
...and you're dead
to the knowledge of your god!

752
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:53,225
My brothers and sisters, he should get
down on his knees, and beg ourmercy!

753
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:55,355
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

754
00:46:55,442 --> 00:46:59,310
...his kind has committed God's greatest
crime against your and my kind...

755
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:01,611
...every day of his life!
- (cheering)

756
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:05,447
He oughta get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime!

757
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:08,406
But does he do that? Does he do that? No!

758
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,281
No, he scorns you.
He splits your head with his night stick!

759
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:15,163
He busts you upside the head
with that billy club!

760
00:47:15,254 --> 00:47:16,997
And he calls you a nigger!

761
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:21,134
I'm tellin' you, he calls you a coon!
That's what he says to you! "Boy! Nigger!"

762
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:23,554
- 400 years is long enough.
- (approving shouts)

763
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:27,172
You've been sittin' down and layin' down
and bowin' down for 400 years.

764
00:47:27,266 --> 00:47:30,884
I think it's time to stand up.
I think it's time to stand up.

765
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:34,228
- We're with you, Brother Malcolm!
- All right! Bless you.

766
00:47:34,314 --> 00:47:36,770
- Bless you.
- We're together.

767
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,522
- Praise him! Praise him!
- Come on up.

768
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,695
- Glory, my Lord! Praise him! Praise him!
- Yeah!

769
00:47:44,783 --> 00:47:45,898
Praise him!

770
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:49,943
- Praise him!
- How you doin'?

771
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,324
Yeah. All right. Yes. Good to see you.

772
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:56,086
(excited chatter)

773
00:47:57,671 --> 00:47:59,711
Yes, sir. Next Wednesday, eight o'clock.

774
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:02,883
- I'll be there!
- I'll see you there.

775
00:48:02,968 --> 00:48:05,127
Brother Baines? Excuse me, sister.

776
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,174
You think we can, uh,
get a loudspeaker set up outside?

777
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:11,848
I'm sure we can.
Brother Malcolm, this is Sister Betty.

778
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:14,853
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

779
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:18,272
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

780
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:19,604
Good. Good.

781
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:23,193
- As salaam alaikum.
- Wa-alaikum salaam, sister.

782
00:48:24,198 --> 00:48:26,736
Brother Minister, your sister wonders...

783
00:48:26,825 --> 00:48:29,696
...if you know what
Sister Harriet Tubman did...

784
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:32,704
...between taking souls
to the Promised Land.

785
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,494
Uh, I don't know. What's that, sister?

786
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:38,625
She ate.

787
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,338
Excuse me.

788
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,764
She's interesting.

789
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:56,470
So, Brother Minister, I was hoping that
you would come and speak to my class.

790
00:48:56,563 --> 00:48:59,233
Yes. Yes, I'll speak to your class.

791
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:03,734
- But I'm a hard man on the women.
- Are you?

792
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:06,312
Yes, we have to be careful
when it comes to women.

793
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:11,911
Because too many of our women,
they have too much of the devil in 'em.

794
00:49:12,246 --> 00:49:15,330
Bleachin' and dyein' and...

795
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,538
...ironin' their hair.

796
00:49:19,378 --> 00:49:22,794
Runnin' around in the streets half-naked.

797
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:28,591
(snorts) Talkin' too much,
listenin' to the wrong men.

798
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:32,297
Makin' em deceitful,
untrustworthy, fresh...

799
00:49:32,391 --> 00:49:34,846
And you men are to blame, too.

800
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:38,564
We don't protect, we don't value,
we don't even support them.

801
00:49:38,564 --> 00:49:41,137
See, the building of a new nation...

802
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:44,518
...begins with the woman.

803
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:49,072
Because the mother
is the first teacher of the child.

804
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,368
The message she gives that child...

805
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:53,740
...the child gives to the world,
so we have to be very careful.

806
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:56,865
When it comes to... to choosing a mate...

807
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:01,416
...Samson,
the strongest man that ever lived...

808
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:04,919
...was destroyed by the woman
that slept in his arms.

809
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:07,498
Should I tell my sisters, then, that...

810
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:10,262
...we don't believe in marriage?

811
00:50:10,346 --> 00:50:13,097
No! (chuckles) We don't oppose marriage.

812
00:50:13,182 --> 00:50:17,096
Cos we're not Catholic priests.
We don't believe in celibacy, no.

813
00:50:17,186 --> 00:50:19,558
Mr Muhammad teaches us
that if a woman is, uh...

814
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:22,482
...the right height for a man,
the right complexion...

815
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:26,778
If she's half the man's age, plus seven...

816
00:50:28,322 --> 00:50:34,823
...and if she understands
that man's essential nature is strong...

817
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,533
...and she's willin' to support that...

818
00:50:37,623 --> 00:50:39,662
...and if she's, uh...

819
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,878
...if she can sew, and she can cook,
and, um, loves children...

820
00:50:43,962 --> 00:50:46,169
...and stays out of trouble...

821
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:49,460
I think you've made your points,
Brother Minister Malcolm.

822
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:52,755
- Good.
- You haven't any time for marriage.

823
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:54,222
- No.
- (both laugh)
