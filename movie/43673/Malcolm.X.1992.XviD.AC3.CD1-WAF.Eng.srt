1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,122
In the name of Allah, the merciful.

2
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:08,958
All praises due to Allah,
Lord of all worlds.

3
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,061
The one God to whom praise
is due forever.

4
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:14,030
The one who came to us in the person
of Fard Muhammad...

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,023
...and raised up the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad. Amen.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,272
How do you feel?

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,674
- Who do we want to hear?
- Malcolm X!

8
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:27,143
Are we gonna bring him on?

9
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:29,112
Yes, we gonna bring him on.

10
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,048
Let us hear from our minister,
Mr. Malcolm X!

11
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:36,041
Let us bring him on with
a round of applause.

12
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:45,962
I'm here to tell you that
I charge the white man.

13
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,966
I charge the white man with being
the greatest murderer on earth.

14
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,959
I charge the white man with being
the greatest kidnapper on earth.

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,974
There's no place in this world that
that man can go...

16
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,511
...and say he created peace
and harmony. Everywhere he's gone...

17
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,179
...he's created havoc.

18
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,382
Everywhere he's gone,
he's created destruction.

19
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:10,375
So I charge him with being
the greatest kidnapper on this earth!

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,190
I charge him with being the greatest
murderer on this earth!

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,183
I charge him with being the greatest
robber and enslaver on this earth!

22
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,530
I charge the white man...

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,523
...with being the greatest swine-eater
and drunkard on this earth!

24
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,537
He can't deny the charges.

25
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:31,530
You can't deny the charges!
We're the living proof of those charges!

26
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,811
You and I are the proof.

27
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:38,348
You're not an American.
You are the victim of America!

28
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,417
You didn't have a choice coming here.
He didn't say:

29
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:45,421
"Black man, black woman, come over
and help me build America."

30
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,024
He said, "Nigger, get in the boat.

31
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:52,017
I'm taking you over there to help me
build America."

32
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:55,431
Being born here
does not make you an American.

33
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:59,424
You and I are not American. You're one
of the 22 million black people...

34
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:05,097
...who are victims of America.
You and I, we've never seen democracy.

35
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,202
There's no democracy in the fields
of Georgia. No democracy down there.

36
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:15,641
We didn't see any democracy in Harlem,
Brooklyn, Detroit, Chicago.

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,813
Ain't no democracy there.
We've never seen democracy.

38
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:25,228
All we've seen is hypocrisy.

39
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,198
We don't see any American dream.

40
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:32,191
We've experienced only
the American nightmare.

41
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,165
See that spot?
Get it. The spot!

42
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:40,158
All right, that's it.

43
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,443
Hey, Cholly!

44
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:24,414
Where'd you get that number you hit on?
Was it your girl's address?

45
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:28,407
No, my grandma gave me that number
in my dreams. Straight!

46
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,486
3-8-4.

47
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,588
You said Sassy Frassy gave you...

48
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:33,923
That woman quit me.

49
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:37,916
After I hit the number, that woman
was no good to me at all.

50
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:42,654
She said I was cheap because
I wouldn't cop her a diamond ring.

51
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,858
And on top of that,
had the indignation...

52
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:51,007
...to call me, of all people,
Good-time Cholly...

53
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:54,377
...a cheap, black son of a bitch.

54
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,812
Where's homeboy?

55
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,680
Hey, Little.

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,673
Your man out here waiting on you.

57
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,887
There he is.

58
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,890
Fixing to get that first conk laid on?

59
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,026
Be hot like hell.

60
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,427
Don't be scared, son.

61
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:14,364
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

62
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,033
You in the hands of an expert.

63
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:21,026
My hair was just like yours.
Look what he did for me.

64
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,773
Heckle and Jeckle...

65
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,876
...don't scare the man no more than
he's scared already.

66
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,046
- Get his forehead and eyebrows.
- Who's doing this?

67
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,749
You all heard that!

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,742
Pull my coat if it stings. This shit
can burn a hole through cement.

69
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,421
Hold tight.

70
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,924
I thought you said
this would sting, Shorty.

71
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,359
This ain't nothing.

72
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,395
- Feel good, don't it?
- Real good?

73
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,929
Yeah, it's all right.

74
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,464
You'll feel better.

75
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,267
It is heating up a bit.

76
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,935
It's starting to heat up.

77
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,070
It's okay.

78
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,772
Feeling better, ain't it?

79
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,608
- Just hold on.
- I'm holding, but it's heating.

80
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,910
Gotta make it straight.

81
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,080
That's what he told me too.

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,084
I gotta get this out now.
It's starting...

83
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:12,077
- Hold on.
- I'm holding, I'm holding.

84
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,891
Give me a hand!

85
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,093
Help me out! Hold him!

86
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,995
We're going to the sink!

87
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,963
I got to get up! I got to get up!

88
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,698
- Cool it!
- Put water on it!

89
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:23,833
More water!

90
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,602
You're getting it in my eye!

91
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,572
- How's it feel?
- Like there's no skin on my head!

92
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,907
If you can talk, it's out.

93
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,609
- How does it look?
- Can't tell yet.

94
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,712
Is it straight?
I'm not doing it again.

95
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:40,705
Let me dry it.

96
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,743
I can tell it's laying down.

97
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:49,915
Don't take it off yet.

98
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,741
Looks white, don't it?

99
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,510
All right!

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,445
Well, all root!

101
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:13,438
All reet!

102
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,091
Hit the brim with the left.

103
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:53,990
When my mother was pregnant with me...

104
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,983
...a party of Klansmen surrounded
our house in Omaha, Nebraska.

105
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,387
They brandished guns and shouted
for my father to come out.

106
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,703
My pregnant mother went to the door...

107
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:11,140
...and said that my father was in
Milwaukee, preaching.

108
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,776
They said that good white Christians...

109
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,769
...would not stand for his
troublemaking and to get out of town.

110
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:39,991
They broke every window with
their rifles before riding away.

111
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:45,197
They rode off into the moonlight as
suddenly as they had come.

112
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:50,835
My father was not a frightened Negro,
as most were and many still are today.

113
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,983
He was 6 feet 4 and very strong.

114
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,052
He believed, as did Marcus Garvey...

115
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,721
...that freedom, independence
and self-respect...

116
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,623
...wouldn't be achieved
by Negroes in America.

117
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,616
- The object of building up for
themselves a great nation in Africa.

118
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,196
Therefore...

119
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:11,189
...black men should leave America and
return to their land of origin.

120
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:15,738
My father dedicated his life
to his beliefs...

121
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:18,708
...because four of his six brothers
died violently.

122
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,877
Three killed by white men,
and one lynched.

123
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:24,714
There were nine children in our family.

124
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:28,707
My mother was a proud woman, an
educated woman, a strong woman.

125
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:33,278
She was fair-skinned because her mother
was raped by a white man.

126
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,649
One reason she married my father was
because he was so black.

127
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:41,686
She hated her complexion and wanted
her children to have some color.

128
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,658
I think this had a profound effect on
me then and on most Negroes today.

129
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:51,896
Because so many of our sisters have been
raped or violated by the white man...

130
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:56,801
...black men can't wait to get their
hands on the white man's prize:

131
00:09:56,912 --> 00:10:00,905
A white woman.

132
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,943
Africa for the Africans!

133
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:08,591
Say "Roseland."

134
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:11,761
Showtime!

135
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:15,754
Showtime!

136
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,195
Hi, Shorty!

137
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,630
You're too big!

138
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,623
I'm gonna come get you.

139
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:59,130
Come on, Shorty,
I've gotta dance!

140
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,577
You in charge, boy!

141
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:17,615
You like what you see, baby?

142
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,395
Get back here!

143
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,830
Go ahead, boy!

144
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,732
Red, save me! Save me!

145
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:26,725
Gotcha!

146
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:38,970
Come on, Shorty. I wanna dance again!

147
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,440
Laura sure can go, can't she?

148
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,809
- I gotta go freshen up.
- All right.

149
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,945
- You come on back now.
- All right, Malcolm.

150
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,848
That chick is fine as May wine.

151
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:56,318
Except she lives up on a hill
and got a grandmother too.

152
00:13:56,318 --> 00:14:00,311
She a church girl.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

153
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,903
Wanna dance?

154
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,106
So what do they call you?

155
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:55,099
Red.

156
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,379
I'm Sophia.

157
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,614
How you doing?

158
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,250
Very well, thank you.

159
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,254
I have an idea, Red.

160
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:09,247
Why don't you take that
little girl home and come on back?

161
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:20,569
Just walk, baby, don't run.

162
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:24,562
It'll be here when you get back.

163
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:40,289
Well, I better not come in.

164
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,025
I'm not stupid.

165
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,193
It's late, baby.

166
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,363
I know where you're going.
I am not a total square.

167
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,033
- I know what's happening...
- I gotta go home. It's late.

168
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:55,026
I gotta get up early in the morning.
I gotta work tomorrow.

169
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,341
I'll call you tomorrow?

170
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,210
What for?

171
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,203
I'm not white and I don't put out,
so why would you want to call me?

172
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:14,045
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
I'll call you tomorrow.

173
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,368
Am I the first white woman
you've been with?

174
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,581
No, you ain't.

175
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:16,574
Shit, I done had plenty.

176
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,678
That isn't a whore?

177
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,606
Take your time.

178
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:41,599
Sophia's not going anywhere.

179
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,279
I told you to walk...

180
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,272
...don't run.

181
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:52,677
I don't like women that talk too much.

182
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:59,417
Who wants to talk?

183
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,013
You missed me.

184
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:22,006
Try this on for size.

185
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,754
- I ducked.
- You ducked?

186
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,323
You didn't! I got you
right between the toes!

187
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:32,027
I'm tired of playing the cops.
I wanna be Bogart.

188
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,097
Shorty, you're too small to be Bogart.

189
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:39,090
I'm not too short to be Cagney.

190
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:44,629
One more!

191
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:50,568
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

192
00:18:56,518 --> 00:19:00,511
You used to be a big shot.

193
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,360
There is just nothing I can do.

194
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,697
- What do you mean, took his own life?
- You heard the verdict.

195
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:12,690
Verdict? A man takes a hammer and
bashes in the back of his own head?

196
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:16,638
Then he lays on the tracks
and kills himself?

197
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,208
We only act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

198
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:23,201
Do you pay or don't you?

199
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,417
Read the policy, ma'am.

200
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,410
It clearly states...

201
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:43,354
Come here, Sophia.

202
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,142
You're the man.

203
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:58,135
Sit down.

204
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,485
What's your story?

205
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:07,478
You one of them white chicks
can't get enough colored studs?

206
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,459
Kiss my foot.

207
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,630
Go ahead, kiss it.

208
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:36,707
Now feed me.

209
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,839
That's your story, girl.

210
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,775
So when you gonna holler rape?

211
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,776
Me?

212
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,612
Yes, you.
You would, if the time came.

213
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,614
Sure you would.

214
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,883
Malcolm, let me feed you.

215
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:10,319
Come on.

216
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,312
While they're hot.

217
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:23,665
I wish your mother and father
could see you now.

218
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:25,901
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

219
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:29,894
I sure wish Laura could see us.

220
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,423
Please, Malcolm.

221
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,926
There's nobody around.

222
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:28,063
No, this ain't right.

223
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:30,632
- Why?
- Because you...

224
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:33,802
No, it's because of
the white girl, isn't it?

225
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:37,795
- It's not because of that.
- Folks say you run around with her.

226
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:42,500
Save it for Mr. Right. Your
grandmother's smarter than you think.

227
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:49,840
I'm sorry she raised me that way.

228
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,458
Is your mother alive?

229
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,894
Yes, she's alive.

230
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:02,030
When I was a kid, I was so poor
I thought "not for sale"...

231
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,900
...was a brand name.

232
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,001
I did knock.

233
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:08,703
Did you hear me say, "Come in"?

234
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:12,074
There's no point in fighting about it.
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:16,067
- May I sit down?
- You're nice enough to ask.

236
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,716
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

237
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:25,353
- Since your husband's death...
- Murder. Murder.

238
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:29,346
...there's a question as to whether you
can raise these children alone.

239
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,863
These are my children.

240
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,632
They're mine.

241
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,468
And they ain't no question.

242
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:43,461
Sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor
is the only kindness.

243
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:46,908
All your children are delinquent...

244
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:50,345
...and one at least,
Malcolm, is a thief.

245
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,079
Get out!

246
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:54,816
Your control over your
children is nonexistent.

247
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:58,809
Did you hear me?

248
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:00,555
You will regret this.

249
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:04,548
If you don't move through that door,
you'll be past regretting!

250
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:11,589
We were parceled out, all of us.

251
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:15,659
I truly believe that if ever
a state agency destroyed a family...

252
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,839
...it destroyed ours.

253
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,832
I was sent to a detention
home and lived at this woman's house.

254
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,713
Mrs. Swerlin.

255
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,150
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

256
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,019
We'll treat him like a brother.

257
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,756
I was special. The only
colored kid in the class.

258
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:38,727
I became sort of a mascot,
like a pink poodle.

259
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,564
I got called a nigger so much,
I didn't think it was wrong.

260
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,433
I thought it was my name.

261
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,770
They talked about me like I wasn't
there. Like a pedigreed dog...

262
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,939
...or a horse.

263
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,641
Like I was invisible.

264
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:56,578
The important thing
is to be realistic.

265
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,648
We all like you here, you know that.

266
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,449
But you're a nigger...

267
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:04,819
...and a lawyer is no realistic
goal for a nigger.

268
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:07,722
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

269
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:10,192
I gets the best grades in class.

270
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,895
I got voted class president.
I want to be a lawyer.

271
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:17,632
I want you to think about
something that you can be.

272
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:21,469
You're good with your hands,
making things.

273
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:24,739
People would give you work. I would.

274
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:27,209
Why not become a carpenter?

275
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:30,946
That's a good profession for a colored.

276
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,815
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

277
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:36,618
Jesus was a carpenter.

278
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,611
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

279
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,692
Remember what we said.

280
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:46,494
"Nothing succeeds like success."
Say it.

281
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:48,997
Nothing succeeds like success.

282
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:51,099
As long as you're realistic.

283
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:55,092
It's not the end of the world.

284
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:58,273
I said, "Don't...

285
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:01,243
...let them give that boy no pig."

286
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,245
It wasn't the end
of the world for me.

287
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:07,238
But it was the beginning of the end
for my mother.

288
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:14,845
A right cross to the jaw by Louis.

289
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:20,028
Louis takes Conn's head back
with a right uppercut.

290
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,863
Louis hits left and right.

291
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:25,667
And Conn is down
with a right cross to the jaw!

292
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,302
He's taking the count.

293
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:30,805
Four, five, six...

294
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,175
...seven. He's on his back.
Eight. Nine.

295
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:38,168
He's getting up!
The referee says it's all over!

296
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,319
What in hell is going on?

297
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,520
Nothing, Mr. Cooper.

298
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,322
The customer's are hungry.

299
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,057
Soup done finished, Mr. Cooper.

300
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:51,326
Right, Mr. Charlie.

301
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,561
The name is Mr. Cooper.

302
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:55,297
Don't you forget it.

303
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:59,290
Mr. Cooper.

304
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:03,004
What's the matter with you?
You want me to get fired!

305
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:04,572
I got a wife and six kids!

306
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,075
Mr. Cooper is good white folk!

307
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:11,068
You is a young fool!

308
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,046
There'll never be another one like that!

309
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:23,591
He's done it!

310
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:26,061
And by a knockout...

311
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,864
...and still the world's
heavyweight champion:

312
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:32,167
Joe Louis!

313
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,135
Ham and cheese!
Excuse me, sir.

314
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:37,105
Ham and cheese here! I got coffee.

315
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:40,041
- Lemon meringue pie.
- Hey, boy!

316
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,645
- Ham and cheese.
- Yes, sir. Best in the house.

317
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:46,614
- You're pleased with yourself.
- I aims to please, sir.

318
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:47,916
I'm pleased to aim.

319
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,909
- I like you, boy.
- Thank you.

320
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,589
Keep the change.

321
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,582
Right, sir!
Ham and cheese!

322
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:09,026
Harlem!

323
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,059
And here's Joe Lewis,
back in Harlem.

324
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,328
They're celebrating!
They're going crazy!

325
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:36,831
They're dancing! They're hanging
from street signs!

326
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,933
Everybody's out!

327
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:42,926
Everyone's having a great time!
Listen to them roar!

328
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:20,675
Joe's a credit to his race.
What a fine gentleman!

329
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,844
But he's also a fine American.

330
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,837
The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis!

331
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,118
Hey, sugar.

332
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:33,021
- Slow down. What's your hurry?
- No hurry.

333
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,790
Let me show you something new.

334
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,026
I got gold watches, diamond rings.

335
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,228
Any one of these. Whatever you need.

336
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:41,362
I don't need that.

337
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,732
You need something, baby.
Whatever you need!

338
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:48,725
A couple of these
make a player look good.

339
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,267
My man!

340
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:23,260
- The word is "excuse me," boy.
- "Excuse me" don't shine my shoes.

341
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:27,798
Then stay out of my way.

342
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:31,969
Old country nigger.

343
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:38,208
What you gonna do?

344
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:46,550
Go home to your mama?

345
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:57,995
Nigger, don't you ever in your life
say anything against my mother!

346
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:24,421
Give me a whiskey.

347
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,907
I ordered a single, Jack.

348
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:36,900
The double's on that gentleman, "Jack."

349
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:42,116
Who is that?

350
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,586
That's West Indian Archie.

351
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,488
What's his angle?

352
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:51,481
Some of this, some of that.

353
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:06,541
Nothing's gonna bite you.

354
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,943
You look like you're new in town.

355
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:12,213
From what I can see,
you're pretty handy with a bottle.

356
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,549
He had it coming.

357
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:18,542
Pull up a chair.

358
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,363
What do they call you?

359
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,331
Red.

360
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,933
And I ain't no punk.

361
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,002
You better not be.

362
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,904
Any cat toe you down here,
you stand up or make tracks.

363
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:38,272
Man live by his rep.

364
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:40,575
Better believe it.

365
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,310
So what do you do?

366
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,113
Working on the train.

367
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:46,347
Like that job?

368
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:50,218
- Keeps me out of the Army.
- They want you, nothing'll keep you out.

369
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,021
Not this boy.

370
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,590
So I hear tell
you're a good man to know.

371
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,959
- Where you hear that?
- Boston, where I'm from.

372
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,694
Kiss my neck.

373
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:01,496
I've never been in Beantown.

374
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:05,366
Like the man said, a man's rep travels.

375
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:09,003
How about that!

376
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:10,304
You bullshitting me?

377
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:13,508
My father told me
never bullshit a West Indian.

378
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:15,009
Your daddy's West Indian?

379
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,711
My mama.

380
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,946
She's from Grenada.

381
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:22,939
Grenada.

382
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:25,353
I like this guy.

383
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:28,122
I like your country.

384
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,524
Grenada.

385
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:32,460
Where'd you get them
goddamn vines you got on?

386
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,362
And them shoes?

387
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:35,363
Oh, my.

388
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,065
We can do something about that.

389
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:40,468
But he's putting a hurting
on my vision, man!

390
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,336
Relax.

391
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:43,538
How do I find you?

392
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,540
You can't.

393
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,175
I get ahold of you.

394
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,477
All right, I'll write it down.

395
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:51,512
Don't ever write anything down.

396
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,548
File it up here.

397
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,750
Like I do.

398
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,721
If the man don't have any paper,
he will never have any proof.

399
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,390
Dig?

400
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,383
Yeah, I dig. Right.

401
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,299
Look me in the face.

402
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,292
Did you just con me?

403
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,371
Yes, sir.

404
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:18,439
Why?

405
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,775
Because I want in.

406
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:23,678
It don't take a lot to know
you're already there.

407
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,580
At least he ain't lying.

408
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,248
I have a run to make.

409
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:31,241
Let me make that run
with you, Mr. Archie.

410
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:40,795
I like your heart.

411
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:43,464
I like your style.

412
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:45,666
You might just do, Mr. Red.

413
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,170
Unless you have to
get back to your train job.

414
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,439
I've told him what to do
with that train.

415
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:55,432
- When?
- Just now.

416
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,114
All right.

417
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,549
Come with me.

418
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:05,119
I'm taking you shopping.

419
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,488
Cadillac's the name.

420
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:10,258
Sammy, man.

421
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:14,251
- You ready?
- Good.

422
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:19,456
Button more buttons on the jacket.

423
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:27,842
You look good.

424
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:29,410
But you're missing something.

425
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,812
Frisk me.

426
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:34,805
Go ahead, frisk me.

427
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:45,448
Nothing, right?

428
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:50,464
I'm still carrying.

429
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:53,734
This was my first gun.

430
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,727
Now it's yours.

431
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:03,511
Thank you.

432
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,613
You wear it...

433
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:08,416
...wear it so.

434
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,652
Small of the back.

435
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:15,389
Now you're outfitted.

436
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:16,757
Ready for the streets?

437
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,893
I'm ready.

438
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,127
Let them come.

439
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:24,120
Let us now turn to
the Gospel According to St. John.

440
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,567
Chapter 3...

441
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,637
...verse 23.

442
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:30,671
323.

443
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:34,664
"And John also was baptizing
in Aenon near Salim...

444
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:41,104
...because there was much water.

445
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:45,319
And they came...

446
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:49,312
...and were baptized."

447
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:53,261
313.

448
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:54,629
255.

449
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,131
It got to be 251.

450
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,165
403.

451
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:00,268
I saw it in my dream.

452
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,803
555.

453
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,474
- What do you know?
- I feel straight.

454
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,875
Your lucky day.

455
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,745
Roll it for me.

456
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:13,514
I told you, no paper, no trouble.

457
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,950
I'm working on it.

458
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,619
I keep my numbers in my head.

459
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:22,612
I've never written a number down yet.
Remember that.

460
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:41,464
Your turn.

461
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:48,939
Easy.

462
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:52,920
Easy.

463
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,921
You there?

464
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,523
If I ain't, I'm next door.

465
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,516
Nothing in this world can give you
that real deep cool.

466
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:03,887
The girl.

467
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,372
About as mellow as I can be.

468
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,254
Cool enough to kill.

469
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:31,258
I realize that.

470
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:35,251
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- Stick them up.

471
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,935
Archie!

472
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:44,928
Baby?

473
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:51,868
Malcolm, you're so funny.

474
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,406
Give me some money, baby.

475
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:01,389
Come on, baby.

476
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:05,382
The bitch move too slow.

477
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:10,598
Sometimes this guy
has a big ugly mouth.

478
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,267
What time is it, baby?

479
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,469
8:21.

480
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:17,505
I like that. Combinate me.

481
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:19,407
821.

482
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:22,343
128.

483
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:24,011
218.

484
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:28,004
I'm taking the bet.

485
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:33,810
Time to reload.

486
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:22,536
I thought you said we was going
to the movies last night.

487
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:23,671
You said that.

488
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,806
I'm sorry. I say a lot of things.

489
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:26,874
I believed you.

490
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:30,867
Do your job now. Get me a pack
of Lucky Strikes and a cognac.

491
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:44,959
Daniel come in yet?

492
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,361
Ain't that him?

493
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,896
Gorgeous!

494
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,889
How you been today?
You been waiting long?

495
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:57,071
Let me look at you.

496
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:00,808
- I've been missing you today, Laura.
- How you doing, baby?

497
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:04,712
I'm all right. Copacetic. Great.
Did you work today?

498
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,515
No, baby, I didn't go to work.

499
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:10,885
- I need a five-spot.
- I gave you 10 this morning.

500
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,554
Give me the goddamn $5!

501
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,189
It ain't the money.
I wanna...

502
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:17,024
...make sure you're okay.

503
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,927
I gotta pay back this guy.

504
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,563
I'll be right back.

505
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,064
Like last time?

506
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,400
I swear, I'll be right back.

507
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,393
Laura, I love you.

508
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:40,514
You know that chick?

509
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:42,583
You a private detective now?

510
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,717
Just asking.

511
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:45,953
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

512
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:49,590
I ask you the questions.
You understand?

513
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,092
- She come in here a lot?
- Almost every night.

514
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,828
With him?

515
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:58,821
- She know he's high?
- Lf she got eyes, she do.

516
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,935
She ain't hooking?

517
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,437
Not yet, Red.

518
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:07,430
But the way things are,
he'll turn her out any day now.

519
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,113
You stuck on her?

520
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:17,106
That's your problem.
You need to mind your own business.

521
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,188
Don't do that!

522
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:25,181
I wanna talk to you, all right?
Have a seat.

523
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,669
- Don't pay him any mind, hear?
- All right.

524
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:39,662
- All right?
- I'm all right.

525
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:47,937
Buy yourself something nice.

526
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:01,851
Hey, baby.

527
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:08,291
Give me a light.

528
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,812
You look uptight.
What's the problem?

529
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:19,980
- No problem.
- Sure?

530
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,973
Everything's all right.
I'm not worrying about it.

531
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,921
I'm thinking about my money.

532
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,923
Six big ones you owe me, right?

533
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:30,958
What?

534
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:32,226
821.
It hit, didn't it?

535
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:34,261
You didn't have 821.

536
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:38,132
Were you high? I threw the slats
at you, told you to combinate me.

537
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,667
You never had it.

538
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,269
I tell you I did. Sophia was there.

539
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:44,071
You remember, don't you?

540
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:46,674
What would she say?

541
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:48,342
Don't do this.

542
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:49,843
All right?

543
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:53,080
All right.

544
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,082
All right, skip it.

545
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,351
But you're slipping, aren't you?

546
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:01,344
You done slipped.

547
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,683
Archie, wait.

548
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:18,305
Come on, Archie. Look...

549
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:21,375
Come on. You want a drink
or something? I'm buying.

550
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,245
I ain't drinking with you.

551
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:29,238
All right?

552
00:44:30,718 --> 00:44:33,320
Come, Sam.

553
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,313
I'll be right there, man.

554
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:44,131
Twenty-two years.

555
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:48,001
Twenty-two years, I never
knowed him to forget a number.

556
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,737
First time for everything.

557
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,772
What are you talking about?

558
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,765
The first thing he'll do is check
with the collector for an oversight.

559
00:44:56,643 --> 00:45:00,647
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

560
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:04,640
And, Red, if you're lying,
you're a dead man.

561
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:09,278
Dead, dead, dead.

562
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:14,717
You go and tell him that.

563
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,002
My man, Red.

564
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:24,371
Night to you.

565
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:28,364
I don't understand Archie.
You had the number.

566
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:05,401
Didn't I tell you never sit
with your back to no door?

567
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,353
You know what?

568
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,355
You're a damn liar.

569
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:19,348
And so is she.

570
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:22,129
So you figure to take me...

571
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:24,498
...you bastard?

572
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:26,066
I'm taking you.

573
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,502
- So it's you and me?
- That's right.

574
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:30,337
I'll give you the $600.

575
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:32,306
- I don't want it.
- I'm wearing.

576
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:36,299
There's three guns on you,
so you take your chances.

577
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:51,047
Let's walk.

578
00:46:56,163 --> 00:46:59,266
So this is how I'm going out?

579
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:02,936
- In a toe-down?
- Toe-down, yes.

580
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:06,929
- Let's go.
- We'll let Billie finish.

581
00:47:51,818 --> 00:47:53,287
Thank you.

582
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:57,280
Thank you very much. Thank you.

583
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,048
Wake up.

584
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:24,351
Wake up!

585
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:28,344
There's somebody out there.

586
00:48:29,122 --> 00:48:33,115
Wake the kids.

587
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:48,564
Follow me! Wait! Wait!

588
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:54,103
Go! Go!

589
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:58,274
Careful!

590
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:02,623
- Good thing we're all good Christians.
- It's time for you to leave this town.

591
00:49:02,623 --> 00:49:04,091
It's a free country.

592
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:07,661
We warned you about Garvey preaching!
Stirring up the good niggras!

593
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,029
I ain't a boy!

594
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,897
- I'm a man!
- You're a dead nigger.

595
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:13,667
And a real man don't hide
behind sheets!

596
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:17,660
You take these bullets for them sheets!

597
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,512
I know you're a better shot than that.

598
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:27,614
You should've killed them.

599
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:29,916
You should've shot them all dead.

600
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:32,419
I just wanted to scare them.

601
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:36,412
They won't be around here
bothering us no more.

602
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:39,359
They won't be here no time soon.

603
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,929
I'm a man!

604
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:46,922
That'll teach you.

605
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:52,472
Get a doctor!

606
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:56,209
He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a preacher.
