1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,921
In the name of Allah, the merciful.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,674
All praises due to Allah,
Lord of all worlds.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,843
The one God to whom praise
is due forever.

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,804
The one who came to us in the person
of Fard Muhammad...

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,765
and raised up the honorable
Elijah Muhammad. Amen.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,183
Amen.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,271
- How do you feel?
- Fine, sir!

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,606
- Who do we want to hear?
- Malcolm X!

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,066
Are we gonna bring him on?

10
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,902
Yes, we gonna bring him on.

11
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,822
Let us hear from our minister,
Mr. Malcolm X!

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,158
Let us bring him on with
a round of applause.

13
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,207
Brothers and sisters.

14
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,711
I'm here to tell you that
I charge the white man.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,631
I charge the white man with being
the greatest murderer on earth.

16
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:54,094
I charge the white man with being
the greatest kidnapper on earth.

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,556
There's no place in this world
that that man can go...

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,268
and say he created peace
and harmony. Everywhere he's gone...

19
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,936
he's created havoc.

20
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,148
Everywhere he's gone,
he's created destruction.

21
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,611
So I charge him with being
the greatest kidnapper on this earth!

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,947
I charge him with being the greatest
murderer on this earth!

23
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,452
I charge him with being the greatest
robber and enslaver on this earth!

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,454
I charge the white man...

25
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,290
with being the greatest swine-eater
on this earth!

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,000
The greatest drunkard on this earth!

27
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,461
He can't deny the charges.

28
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,048
You can't deny the charges!
We're the living proof of those charges!

29
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,009
You and I are the proof.

30
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,138
You're not an American.
You are the victim of America!

31
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,183
You didn't have a choice coming here.
He didn't say...

32
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,187
black man, black woman, come over
and help me build America.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,689
He said, nigger, get in the boat.

34
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,318
I'm taking you over there to help me
build America.

35
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,197
Being born here
does not make you an American.

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,158
I am not an American,
you are not American.

37
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,285
You're one
of the 22 million black people...

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,958
who are the victims of America.
You and I, we've never seen democracy.

39
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,879
There's no democracy in the fields
of Georgia. No democracy down there.

40
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,677
We didn't see any democracy in Harlem,
Brooklyn, Detroit, Chicago.

41
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,264
Ain't no democracy there.
We've never seen democracy.

42
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,767
All we've seen is hypocrisy.

43
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,479
We don't see any American dream.

44
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,275
We've experienced only
the American nightmare.

45
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,073
We want Malcolm X!
We want Malcolm X!

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,797
See that spot? Get it. The spot!

47
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,217
All right, that's it.

48
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,846
- Thanks.
- Come on.

49
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,342
Hey, Cholly!

50
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,304
Where'd you get that number you hit on?
Was it your girl's address?

51
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,684
No, my grandma gave me that number
in my dreams. Straight!

52
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,394
3-8-4.

53
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,521
You said Sassy Frassy gave you...

54
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,897
That woman quit me.

55
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,110
After I hit the number,
that woman was no good to me at all.

56
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,195
- What happened?
- She said I was cheap...

57
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,656
because I wouldn't cop her
a diamond ring.

58
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,077
And on top of that,
had the indignation...

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,247
to call me, of all people,
Good-time Cholly...

60
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,251
- A cheap, black son of a bitch.
- Sassy Frassy?

61
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,961
Where's homeboy?

62
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,629
- Hey, Little.
- Yeah?

63
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,048
Your man out here waiting on you.

64
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,886
- There he is.
- Hey.

65
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,723
Fixing to get that first conk laid on,
eh, homeboy?

66
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,017
Be hot like hell.

67
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,310
Don't be scared, son.

68
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,229
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

69
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,024
You in the hands of an expert.

70
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,528
My hair was just like yours.
Look what he did for me.

71
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,739
Heckle and Jeckle...

72
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,742
Don't scare the man no more than
he's scared already.

73
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,037
- Get his forehead and eyebrows.
- Who's doing this?

74
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
- You all heard that!
- You all heard that.

75
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,918
Pull my coat if it stings.
This shit can burn a hole through cement.

76
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,462
Hold tight.

77
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,089
I thought you said
this would sting, Shorty.

78
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:43,216
This ain't nothing.

79
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,260
- Feel good, don't it?
- Real good?

80
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,347
- Yeah, it's all right.
- You'll feel better in a minute.

81
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,724
It is heating up a bit.

82
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,061
- It's starting to heat up.
- It's all right.

83
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,729
Feeling better, ain't it?

84
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,523
- Just hold on.
- I'm holding, but it's heating.

85
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,692
- Gotta make it straight.
- All right.

86
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,611
That's what he told me too.

87
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,323
I gotta get this out now.
It's starting...

88
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,328
- Hold on.
- I'm holding, I'm holding.

89
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,705
- Hold on.
- I'm holding on, man!

90
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,249
Give me a hand!
Help me out! Hold him!

91
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,960
- Shorty!
- We're going to the sink!

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,962
I got to get up! I got to get up!

93
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,631
- Cool it!
- Put water on it!

94
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,799
More water!

95
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,051
You're getting it in my eye!

96
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,471
- How's it feel?
- Like there's no skin on my head!

97
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,889
If you can talk, it's out.

98
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,517
- How does it look?
- Can't tell yet.

99
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,395
It's straight, right?
I ain't doing this again.

100
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,188
Let me dry it.

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,068
I can tell it's laying down.

102
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,656
- Don't take it off yet.
- All right.

103
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,660
That's the thing to do.
Come on in here and get through.

104
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,080
A money-maker and a heart-breaker
every step of the way.

105
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,707
You gonna flip.
That's right, watch your lip.

106
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,674
Looks white, don't it?

107
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,883
All right!

108
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,344
Well, all root!

109
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,512
All reet!

110
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,812
Swing.

111
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,283
Hit the brim with the left.

112
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,997
Hey, girls.

113
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,002
Sweet thing.

114
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,221
When my mother was pregnant with me...

115
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:58,226
a party of Klansmen surrounded
our house in Omaha, Nebraska.

116
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,063
They brandished guns and shouted
for my father to come out.

117
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,733
We know you're in there, come out!

118
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,569
My pregnant mother went to the door...

119
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,939
and said that my father
was in Milwaukee, preaching.

120
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,156
He's in Milwaukee.

121
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,700
These hooded men said that
good white Christians...

122
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,496
would not stand for his troublemaking
and to get out of town.

123
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,127
It's all right.

124
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,433
They broke every window
with their rifle butts...

125
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,477
before riding off into the night.

126
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:46,107
They rode off into the moonlight on their
horses as suddenly as they had come.

127
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,446
My father was not a frightened Negro,
as most were and many still are today.

128
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,949
He was 6 feet 4, a very strong man.

129
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,951
He believed, as did Marcus Garvey...

130
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,453
that freedom, independence
and self-respect...

131
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,789
couldn't be achieved
by Negroes in America.

132
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,961
The object of building up for themselves
a great nation in Africa.

133
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,170
Therefore...

134
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,882
black men should leave America
and return to their land of origin.

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,801
To his original home, Africa.

136
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,637
My father dedicated
his life to his beliefs...

137
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,598
because four of his six brothers
died violently.

138
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,726
Three killed by white men,
and one lynched.

139
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,229
There were nine children in our family.

140
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,400
My mother was a proud woman,
an educated woman, a strong woman.

141
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,530
She was fair-skinned because her mother
was raped by a white man.

142
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,409
One reason she married my father
was because he was so black.

143
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,953
She hated her complexion,
the white blood in her body...

144
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,081
and she wanted her children
to have some color.

145
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,751
In fact, I think this had a profound effect
on me back then and on most Negroes today.

146
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,838
Because so many of our sisters...

147
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,716
have been raped
or violated by the white man...

148
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,845
black men can't wait to get their
hands on the white man's prize,

149
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,722
a white woman.

150
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,018
Africa for the Africans!

151
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,023
- Say Roseland.
- Roseland.

152
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,261
Showtime!

153
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,809
Hi, Shorty!

154
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,479
You're too big!

155
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,357
- I'm gonna come get you.
- Oh, no.

156
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,323
Come on, Shorty, I've gotta dance!

157
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:00,950
Yeah.

158
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,786
Hey!

159
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,794
You in charge, boy!

160
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,507
You like what you see, baby?

161
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,720
- No! Get back here!
- Go ahead, boy!

162
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,684
- Red, save me! Save me!
- Gotcha! Yeah.

163
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,029
Come on, Shorty.
I wanna dance again!

164
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,416
Shorty, Shorty! Shorty.

165
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,824
All right, Red. Shorty, Shorty!

166
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,247
Laura sure can go, can't she?

167
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,699
- I gotta go freshen up.
- All right.

168
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,868
- You come on back now.
- All right, Malcolm.

169
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,664
That chick is fine as May wine.

170
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,292
Except she lives up on a hill
and got a grandmother too.

171
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,837
She a church girl.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

172
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,610
Wanna dance?

173
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,947
Yeah.

174
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,096
So, what do they call you?

175
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,641
- Red.
- Red?

176
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,646
- I'm Sophia.
- How you doing, Sophia?

177
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,648
Very well, thank you.

178
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,026
I have an idea, Red.

179
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,948
Why don't you take that little girl
home and come on back?

180
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,130
Wha...?

181
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,917
Just walk, baby, don't run.

182
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,712
It'll be here when you get back.

183
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,229
Well, I better not come in.

184
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,941
- I'm not stupid.
- What?

185
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,192
It's late, baby.

186
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,362
I know where you're going.
I am not a total square.

187
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,907
- I know what's happening...
- I gotta go home. It's late.

188
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,953
I gotta get up early in the morning.
I gotta work tomorrow.

189
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,290
I'll call you tomorrow?

190
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,042
What for?

191
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,964
I'm not white and I don't put out,
so why would you want to call me?

192
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,887
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
I'll call you tomorrow.

193
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,027
Am I the first white woman
you've been with?

194
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,247
No, you ain't.

195
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,741
Shit, I done had plenty.

196
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,409
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

197
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,453
That isn't a whore?

198
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,597
Take your time.

199
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,309
Sophia's not going anywhere.

200
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,895
I told you to walk.

201
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,414
Don't run.

202
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,069
I don't like women that talk
too much, okay?

203
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:53,821
Okay.

204
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,158
Who wants to talk?

205
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,887
- Yeah, Red!
- Come on, you missed me.

206
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,430
Try this on for size.

207
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,770
- I ducked.
- You ducked?

208
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,231
You didn't! I got you
right between the toes!

209
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,901
I'm tired of playing the cops.
I wanna be Bogart.

210
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,987
Shorty, you're too small
to be Bogart.

211
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,864
I'm not too short to be Cagney.

212
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,616
- Boom.
- You...!

213
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,660
Boom.

214
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,370
One more! Boom!

215
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:44,381
Jesus.

216
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,294
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

217
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,136
You used to be a big shot.

218
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,268
There is just nothing I can do.

219
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,729
- What do you mean, took his own life?
- You heard the verdict.

220
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,734
Verdict? A man takes a hammer
and bashes in the back of his own head?

221
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,279
Then he lays on the tracks
and kills himself?

222
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,115
We merely act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

223
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,242
Do you pay or don't you?

224
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,748
Read the policy, ma'am.

225
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,085
It clearly states...

226
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,553
Come here, Sophia.

227
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,190
You're the man.

228
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,610
Sit down.

229
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,451
What's your story?

230
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:08,080
You one of them white chicks can't get
enough colored studs. Is that what you are?

231
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,300
Kiss my foot.

232
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,638
Go ahead, kiss it.

233
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,523
Now, feed me.

234
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah.

235
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,171
That's your story, girl.

236
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,800
- So when you gonna holler rape, sister?
- Me?

237
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,552
Yes, you.
You would, if the time came.

238
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,012
Sure you would.

239
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,556
Malcolm, let me feed you.

240
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
Come on.

241
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,186
While they're hot.

242
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,155
I wish your mother and father
could see you now.

243
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,908
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

244
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,202
I sure wish Laura could see us.

245
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,755
Please, Malcolm.

246
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,716
There's nobody around.

247
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,927
No, this ain't right.

248
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,598
- Why?
- Because you...

249
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,768
No, it's because of the white girl,
isn't it?

250
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,979
- It's not because of that.
- Folks say you run around with her.

251
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,439
It's not because of that.

252
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,443
Save it for Mr. Right.
Your grandmother's smarter than you think.

253
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,616
I'm sorry she raised me that way.

254
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,332
Is your mother alive?

255
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,583
Yes, she's alive.

256
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,088
When I was a kid, I was so poor
I thought "not for sale"...

257
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,465
was a brand name.

258
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,676
- I did knock.
- Did you hear me say, come in?

259
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,056
There's no point in fighting about it.
I'm sorry.

260
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,309
- May I sit down?
- You're nice enough to ask.

261
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,273
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

262
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,069
- Since your husband's death...
- Murder. Murder.

263
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,739
There's a question as to
whether or not you are capable...

264
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,000
of raising these children on your own.

265
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,327
These are my children.

266
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,705
They're mine.

267
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,375
And they ain't no question.

268
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:44,505
Sometimes I think, Mrs. Little,
candor is the only kindness.

269
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,882
All your children are delinquent.

270
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,095
- And one at least, Malcolm, is a thief.
- Get out of here!

271
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,807
Your control over your children
is therefore nonexistent.

272
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,475
Did you hear me?

273
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,479
You will regret this.

274
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,942
If you don't move out through that door,
you'll be past regretting!

275
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,198
We were parceled out, all of us.

276
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,744
I truly believe that if ever
a state agency destroyed a family...

277
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,455
it destroyed ours.

278
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,709
I was sent to a detention home
and lived at this woman's house.

279
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,169
I know you'll keep it clean.

280
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,670
Mrs. Swerlin.

281
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,007
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

282
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,092
We'll treat him like a brother.

283
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,343
Reading the news...

284
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,597
I was special.
The only colored kid in the class.

285
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,225
I became sort of a mascot,
like a pink poodle.

286
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,480
I got called a nigger so much,
I didn't think it was wrong.

287
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,607
I thought it was my name.

288
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:50,362
They talked about me like I wasn't there,
like I was a pedigreed dog or a horse...

289
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,406
like I was invisible.

290
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,494
The important thing is to be realistic.

291
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,205
We all like you here, you know that.

292
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,290
But you're a nigger...

293
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,793
and a lawyer is no realistic goal
for a nigger.

294
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,588
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

295
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,257
I gets the best grades in class.

296
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,886
I got voted class president.
I want to be a lawyer.

297
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,223
I want you to think about something
that you can be.

298
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,976
You're good with your hands,
making things.

299
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,730
People would give you work.
I would, myself.

300
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,274
Why don't you become a carpenter?

301
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,985
That's a good profession
for a colored.

302
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,821
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

303
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,741
Jesus was a carpenter.

304
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,954
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

305
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,415
Remember what we said.

306
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,418
Nothing succeeds like success.
Let me hear it.

307
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,004
Nothing succeeds like success.

308
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,131
Right. As long as you're realistic.

309
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,801
It's not the end of the world, Malcolm.

310
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,680
I said, don't...

311
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,933
let them give that boy no pig.

312
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,317
It wasn't the end of the world for me.

313
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,729
But it was the beginning of the end
for my mother.

314
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,187
A right cross to the jaw by Louis.

315
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,994
Louis takes Conn's head back
with a right uppercut.

316
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,829
Louis hits a left and a right.

317
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,541
And Conn is down
with a right cross to the jaw!

318
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,334
He's taking the count.

319
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,212
Four, five, six...

320
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,133
Seven.
He's on his back. Eight. Nine.

321
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,262
He's getting up!
No, the referee says it's all over!

322
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,348
- The referee says it's all over!
- Yeah!

323
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,394
- What in hell is going on?
- Nothing, Mr. Cooper.

324
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,023
- There's a lot of hungry customers.
- Soup done finished.

325
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,983
That's right, Mr. Charlie.

326
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,943
The name is Mr. Cooper.

327
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,820
Don't you forget it.

328
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,281
Mr. Cooper.

329
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,995
What's the matter with you?
You want me to get fired!

330
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,455
I got a wife and six kids!

331
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,041
Mr. Cooper is good white folk!

332
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,710
You is a young fool!

333
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,672
Jesus.

334
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,763
There'll never be another one
like that!

335
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,515
He's done it!

336
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,060
And by a knockout...

337
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,772
and still the world's
heavyweight champion.

338
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,191
- Joe Louis!
- Yeah!

339
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,151
Ham and cheese!
Excuse me, sir.

340
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,112
Ham and cheese here!
I got coffee.

341
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,948
- Lemon meringue pie.
- Hey, boy!

342
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,577
- Ham and cheese.
- Yes, sir. Best in the house.

343
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,538
- You're pleased with yourself.
- I aims to please, sir.

344
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,873
I'm pleased to aim.

345
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,625
- I like you, boy.
- Thank you.

346
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,049
- Keep the change.
- Right, sir! Ham and cheese!

347
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,058
Harlem!

348
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,666
And here's Joe Louis,
back in Harlem.

349
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,377
They're celebrating!
They're going crazy!

350
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,964
They're dancing and cheering!
They're hanging from street signs!

351
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,716
Everybody's out!

352
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,136
Everyone's having a great time!
Listen to them roar!

353
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,507
Joe's a credit to his race.
What a fine gentleman!

354
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
But he's also a fine American.

355
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,305
The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis!

356
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,867
Hey, sugar.

357
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,978
- Slow down, daddy. What's your hurry?
- No hurry.

358
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,786
Let me show you something
brand-new, baby.

359
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,581
No...

360
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,983
I got gold watches, diamond rings.

361
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,361
- Any one of these. Whatever you need.
- I don't need that.

362
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,656
You need something, baby.
Whatever you need!

363
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,700
A couple of these make
a player look good.

364
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,274
My man!

365
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,737
- The word is excuse me, boy.
- Excuse me don't shine my shoes.

366
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,573
Then you should have stayed out
of my way.

367
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,952
Old country nigger.

368
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:36,166
What you gonna do?

369
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,925
Go home to your mama?

370
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:58,856
Nigger, don't you ever, in your life,
say anything against my mother!

371
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,108
Get up.

372
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,879
Give me a whiskey.

373
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,806
I ordered a single, Jack.

374
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,559
The double's on that gentleman, Jack.

375
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,398
Who is that?

376
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,401
That's West Indian Archie.

377
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,486
What's his angle?

378
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,324
Some of this, some of that.

379
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,672
Come closer,
I'm not fixing to bite you.

380
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,842
You look like you're new in town.

381
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,179
From what I can see,
you're pretty handy with a bottle.

382
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,181
He had it coming.

383
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,058
Pull up a chair.

384
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,195
What do they call you?

385
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,696
Red.

386
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,782
And I ain't no punk.

387
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,367
You better not be.

388
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,828
Any cat toe you down here,
you stand up or make tracks.

389
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,331
- Man live by his rep.
- Better believe it.

390
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,920
- So, what do you do for yourself?
- Working on a train. Selling.

391
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,546
Like that job?

392
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:50,300
- Keeps me out of the Army.
- They want you, nothing will keep you out.

393
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,135
Not this boy.

394
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,639
So I hear tell
you're a good man to know.

395
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,225
- Where you hear that?
- Boston, where I'm from.

396
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,601
Kiss my neck.

397
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,520
I've never been in Beantown.

398
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,564
Like the man said,
a man's rep travels.

399
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,900
How about that.

400
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,278
You bullshitting me?

401
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,532
My father told me
never bullshit a West Indian.

402
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,326
- Your daddy's West Indian?
- My mama.

403
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,745
She's from Grenada.

404
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,030
Grenada.

405
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,062
I like this guy.
I like you, country.

406
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,589
Grenada.

407
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,342
Where'd you get them
goddamn vines you got on?

408
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,387
And them shoes? Oh, my.

409
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,055
We can do something about that.

410
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,517
But he's putting a hurting
on my vision, man. Damn.

411
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,852
Relax.

412
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,938
- So how can I get ahold of you?
- You can't.

413
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,107
I get ahold of you.

414
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,484
All right, I'll write it down.

415
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,528
Don't ever write anything down.

416
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,447
File it up here.

417
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,198
Like I do.

418
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,453
If the man don't have any paper,
he will never have any proof.

419
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,038
Dig?

420
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,473
Yeah.

421
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,167
Yeah, I dig. Right.

422
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,298
Look me in the face.

423
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,133
Did you, just now, con me?

424
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,137
Yes, sir.

425
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,182
- Why?
- Because I want in.

426
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,727
It don't take a lot to know
you're already there.

427
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,604
At least he ain't lying.

428
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,230
I have a run to make.

429
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Let me make that run with you,
Mr. Archie.

430
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,993
I like your heart.

431
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,746
I like your style.

432
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,707
You might just do, Mr. Red.

433
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,127
Unless, of course, you have to
get back to your train job.

434
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,463
I've told him what to do
with that train.

435
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,881
- When?
- Just now.

436
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,513
All right.

437
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,431
Come with me.

438
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,517
I'm taking you shopping.

439
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,937
Cadillac's the name.

440
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,356
Sammy, man.

441
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,192
- You ready?
- Good.

442
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,531
Button more buttons on the jacket.

443
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,574
- You look good.
- Yes, man.

444
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,417
But you're missing something.

445
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,919
- Frisk me.
- What?

446
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,046
Go ahead, frisk me.

447
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,848
Nothing, right?

448
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,272
I'm still carrying.

449
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,315
This was my first gun.

450
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,110
Now it's yours.

451
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,535
Thank you.

452
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,995
You wear it...

453
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,247
Wear it so.

454
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,167
Small of the back.

455
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,670
Now you're outfitted.

456
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,341
- You ready to tackle the streets?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

457
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,051
Let them come.

458
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:25,056
Let us now turn to the Gospel
according to St. John.

459
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,600
Chapter 3...

460
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,519
verse 23.

461
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,188
323.

462
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,775
And John also was baptizing
in Aenon near Salim...

463
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,488
because there was much water.

464
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,826
And they came...

465
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,704
and were baptized.

466
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,541
313.

467
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,419
255.

468
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,630
It got to be 251.

469
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,131
403.

470
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,217
I saw it in my dream.

471
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,844
555.

472
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,555
- What you know, daddy-o?
- I feel straight.

473
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:07,974
Your lucky day.

474
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,343
Roll it for me.

475
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,230
I told you, no paper, no trouble.

476
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,148
I'm working on it.

477
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,652
I keep all my numbers in my head.

478
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,739
I've never written a number down yet.
Remember that.

479
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,838
Your turn.

480
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:45,721
Easy.

481
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,480
- You there?
- If I ain't, I'm right next door.

482
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,651
Nothing in this world can give you
that real deep cool.

483
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,528
The girl.

484
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,630
About as mellow as I can be.

485
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,178
Cool enough to kill.

486
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,763
I realize that.

487
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,727
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- Stick them up.

488
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,523
Hey, Archie.

489
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,235
Baby...

490
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,118
Malcolm, you're so funny.

491
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,080
Give me some money, baby.

492
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,668
Okay.

493
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,296
Come on, baby.

494
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,340
The bitch move too slow.

495
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,597
Sometimes this guy
has a big ugly mouth.

496
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,265
What time is it, baby?

497
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:17,020
- 8:21.
- 8:21, I like that. Combinate me.

498
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,356
- 821.
- Careful, Red.

499
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,649
128.

500
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,069
218.

501
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,739
- I'm taking the bet.
- Yeah, bet.

502
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,785
Time to reload. Time to reload.

503
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:04,734
- Say, Red!
- Red, back again, huh?

504
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,585
I thought you said we was going
to the movies last night.

505
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,755
- You said that.
- I'm sorry. I say a lot of things.

506
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,133
- I believed you.
- Do your job, now.

507
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,677
Get me a pack of Lucky Strikes
and a cognac.

508
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,024
Daniel come in yet?

509
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,693
Ain't that him now?

510
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,528
Gorgeous!

511
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,157
How you been today?
You been waiting long?

512
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,036
Let me look at you.

513
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,832
- I've been missing you today, Laura.
- How you doing, baby?

514
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,377
I'm all right. Copacetic. Great.
Did you work today?

515
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,922
No. You know what time I wound up
last night. I didn't go to work.

516
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,633
- I need a five-spot.
- I gave you 10 this morning.

517
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,553
Laura, give me the goddamn $5!

518
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,056
It ain't the money.
I just wanna make sure you're okay, baby.

519
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,517
I gotta pay back this guy.

520
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,394
I'll be right back.

521
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,147
Like last time?

522
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,316
I swear, I'll be right back.

523
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,568
Laura, I love you.

524
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,578
You know that chick?

525
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,708
- What, you a private detective now?
- Just asking.

526
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,002
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

527
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,420
I ask you the questions.

528
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,689
You understand?

529
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,133
- She come in here a lot?
- Almost every night.

530
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,418
With him?

531
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,431
- She know he's strung out?
- If she got eyes, she do.

532
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,019
- She ain't hooking, is she?
- Not yet, Red.

533
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,689
But the way things are,
he'll turn her out any day now.

534
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,196
You stuck on her, huh?

535
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:18,493
See, that's your problem, girl. You need to
mind your own goddamn business, or I'm...

536
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,287
Don't do that!

537
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,290
- I wanna talk to you, all right? Have a seat.
- All right.

538
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,334
- All right?
- All right.

539
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,635
- Don't pay him any mind, hear?
- All right.

540
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,012
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

541
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,271
You buy yourself something nice.

542
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,284
Hey, baby.

543
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,999
Give me a light.

544
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,845
You look uptight.
What is the problem?

545
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,013
- No problem.
- Sure?

546
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,975
Everything's all right.
I'm not worrying about it.

547
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,643
All right.

548
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,479
I'm thinking about my money.

549
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,939
Six big ones you owe me, Archie.

550
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,317
- What?
- 821. It hit, didn't it?

551
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,068
You didn't have 821.

552
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,989
Were you high? I threw the slats at you,
told you to combinate me.

553
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:42,201
- I'm telling you, you never had it.
- I tell you I did. Sophia was there.

554
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,120
Archie, you remember, don't you?

555
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,007
Wait, what you expect her to say?

556
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,416
Don't do this.

557
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,667
All right?

558
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,377
All right.

559
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,048
All right, skip it.

560
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,924
But you're slipping, Archie?

561
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,677
You done slipped.

562
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,390
Archie, wait.

563
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,820
Come on, Archie. Look...

564
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,574
Come on. You want a drink
or something? I'm buying.

565
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,285
- I ain't drinking with you.
- Oh, Archie.

566
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,663
All right?

567
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,043
Come, Sam.

568
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,421
I'll be right there, man.

569
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,180
Twenty-two years.

570
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,017
Twenty-two years,
I never know him to forget a number.

571
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,686
First time for everything.

572
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,771
What are you talking about?

573
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:56,567
The first thing he'll do is check
with the collector for an oversight.

574
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,821
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

575
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,951
And, Red, if you're lying,
you're a dead man.

576
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,913
Dead, dead, dead.

577
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,375
You go and tell him that.

578
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,300
My man, Red.

579
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,302
Night to you.

580
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,974
I don't understand Archie.
You had the number.

581
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:34,188
Away from the city.

582
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,525
That hurts and mocks.

583
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,988
I'm standin' alone...

584
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,825
by the desolate docks.

585
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:50,663
In the still and the chill...

586
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,750
of the night.

587
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,837
I see the horizon.

588
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,507
The great unknown.

589
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,302
Didn't I tell you never sit
with your back to no door?

590
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,224
It's as heavy as stone.

591
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,517
You know what?

592
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,354
You're a damn liar.

593
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,939
And so is she.

594
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,195
So you figure to take me...

595
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,988
you bastard?

596
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,073
Well, I'm taking you.

597
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,618
- So it's you and me, huh?
- That's right.

598
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,411
I'll give you back the $600.

599
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,371
- I don't want it.
- I'm wearing.

600
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,708
There's three guns on you,
so you take your chances, my friend.

601
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,503
Will the one I love...

602
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,799
be coming back...

603
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,886
to me?

604
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,723
Let's walk.

605
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,853
I cover...

606
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,357
So this is how I'm going out,
huh, Archie?

607
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,068
- In a toe-down?
- Toe-down, yes.

608
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,656
- Let's go.
- Why don't we let Billie finish first.

609
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,617
- No.
- Red.

610
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,872
Must soon come back...

611
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,125
to me.

612
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,470
- Come here!
- Get him!

613
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,556
He's got a gun!

614
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,561
For the one I love...

615
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,272
must soon come back...

616
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,774
You better run!
You're going down!

617
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:47,113
...to me.

618
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,327
Thank you.

619
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,289
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

620
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,979
Wake up.

621
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,524
Wake up!

622
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,152
There's somebody out there.

623
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,823
Wake the kids.

624
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,461
Malcolm!

625
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,465
Follow me! Wait! Wait!

626
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,394
Go! Go!

627
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,556
Careful!

628
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,730
- Good thing we're all good Christians.
- It's time for you to leave this town.

629
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,065
It's a free country.

630
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,777
We warned you about Garvey preaching!
Stirring up the good niggras!

631
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,028
I ain't a boy!

632
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,863
- I'm a man!
- You're a dead nigger.

633
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,783
And a real man don't hide behind
no bed sheets!

634
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,494
You take these here bullets
for them sheets!

635
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,503
I know you're a better shot
than that.

636
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,380
You should've killed them.

637
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,759
- You should've shot all them crackers dead.
- I just wanted to scare them.

638
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,262
They won't be around here
bothering us no more.

639
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,016
They won't be here no time soon.

640
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,935
I'm a man!

641
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,231
That'll teach you, nigger.

642
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,571
Get a doctor!

643
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,819
He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a preacher.

644
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,452
I'm glad we got you out of there.

645
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,706
With Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire...

646
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,000
Boston's the best
goddamn place for you.

647
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,418
Yeah.

648
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,795
We'll take it easy, huh, baby?

649
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,674
I got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

650
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,677
Sounds good.
We'll lay low for a while.

651
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:18,264
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll stake you, baby.

652
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:23,227
I got my band. I'm blowing great sax.
Hell, Red, you ain't even heard us play yet!

653
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,479
Like every hustler, I was trapped.

654
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,815
Cats that hung together
to find security...

655
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,151
to find an answer, found nothing.

656
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,486
Cats that might've cured cancer.

657
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,573
West Indian Archie might've been
a mathematical genius.

658
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,784
We were all victims
of the American social order.

659
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,747
Until that time, there were three things
I was always afraid of.

660
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,875
A job, a bust and jail.

661
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:50,421
But I realized then that I wasn't afraid
of anything. I was an animal.

662
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,923
He don't look too good.

663
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,303
We're gonna rob this town blind.

664
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,221
Anybody want out, say so now.

665
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,101
Good. Okay, I set up a stake,
and I got somebody to move the goods.

666
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,520
We need a driver.
Any suggestions?

667
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,355
- How about Rudy?
- Yeah, Rudy.

668
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,316
Who's Rudy?

669
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,904
I'm half-wop, half-nigger.
I'm not afraid of nobody.

670
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,323
Yeah, right?

671
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,992
- So, what do you do?
- Name it, I claim it.

672
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,745
Rudy does catering.
Rich joints on Beacon Hill.

673
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,164
- All right.
- Tell him about Baldy.

674
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,433
- Baldy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

675
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,336
He's this old, rich ofay motherfucker.

676
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,588
I give him a bath every Friday night.

677
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,634
Towel him off,
talcum powder on him, put him to bed.

678
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,969
Just like a baby.
He gets his jollies off.

679
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,262
What about him?

680
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,433
Guy's got jewelry. He's got
a coin collection. He's got china.

681
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:46,894
- That might be all right.
- He's got rugs.

682
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,815
Shit, I know this town, man.
I got my own fences.

683
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,110
Who is this guy, huh?

684
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,278
Who put you in charge?

685
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,198
- You wanna be in charge?
- I am in charge.

686
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,576
- You head nigger in charge.
- I'm the head nigger in charge.

687
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,246
Big-head nigger, that's what you are.

688
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,207
I'll tell you what we'll do, Rudy.

689
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,209
Because I'm a fair man...

690
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,379
and I like big-head niggers like you.

691
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,548
We'll flip for it.

692
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,592
We'll flip this.

693
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,223
Red.

694
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,517
She loves me.

695
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,186
She loves me not.

696
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,730
She loves me.

697
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,234
She loves me not.

698
00:52:36,777 --> 00:52:38,696
She loves me.

699
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,379
I'll flip first.

700
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,591
Red, cool it. Come on.

701
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,593
Head man in charge, right?

702
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,761
Put the gun down.

703
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,472
All right, we believe you.

704
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,683
We believe you.

705
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,729
Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For chrissakes.

706
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,230
Your turn, Rudy.

707
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,774
Quit fooling around.
Come on, guys.

708
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,240
You don't wanna flip?

709
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,118
- Let me show you. I'll do it again.
- Don't!

710
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,245
Rudy doesn't know how.
I have to show him.

711
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,539
- Red.
- Did you miss something?

712
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,584
You got your eyes open?
Look at me, Rudy.

713
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,086
You don't have to do this, Red.

714
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,298
- Red...!
- That was really dumb.

715
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,805
Your flip, baby. You wanna do it?
No, you don't, do you?

716
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,307
I'll help you.

717
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,392
- Here.
- Red, don't.

718
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,064
Should we shoot that
wop nose of yours off?

719
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,776
Or is that the nigger side?
Is that the wop side or the nigger side?

720
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,404
Is that wop or nigger?
I guess that's the wop side.

721
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,989
I'm not going to jail.

722
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:07,201
Put the gun away, Red.
Come on, this is enough.

723
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,495
Say goodbye, Rudy.

724
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:17,211
I think I heard Rudy said something.
What did you say, Rudy?

725
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,464
- Speak up.
- Okay.

726
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,678
Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna stop?

727
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,681
I did two, so I owe you two, right?

728
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,140
You got it.

729
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,018
- I got it. What did you say?
- You got it.

730
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,853
Rudy says I got it.

731
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,190
Rudy, don't you ever...

732
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,694
try and cross someone
who ain't afraid to die, you hear me?

733
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,488
All right.

734
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,573
This is what we'll do.

735
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,201
We'll hit old Talcum Powder tonight.

736
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,454
My friend Rudy here
is gonna draw up the plans.

737
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,999
Everything that's in the house, right?

738
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,169
Peg, Sophia, you go out
and get those tools like I asked you.

739
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,297
We're gonna hit tonight
because some of us...

740
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,300
have high visibility
during the day.

741
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,346
It's okay with you, right, Rudy?

742
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,893
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

743
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,895
One big, happy family.

744
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,692
I love you.

745
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,084
Red.

746
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,593
What happened to the bullet?
Did you palm that bullet?

747
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,927
What bullet?

748
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,596
The bullet.

749
00:55:52,915 --> 00:55:54,558
You're crazy.

750
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,029
Shorty!

751
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,673
Easy, Shorty. Easy.

752
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,512
Shorty.

753
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,201
My man, Red.

754
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,954
My man!

755
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:42,666
When's Rudy due back?

756
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,210
Thirty minutes.

757
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,215
I'm almost finished.

758
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,683
Girls ought to be getting back
from casing that rug joint.

759
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,185
They should be.

760
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,363
We've done a good job.

761
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,611
We're killing them, ain't we?

762
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,321
- They don't know what's hitting them.
- Yeah...

763
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,699
- Let me work back in this kitchen.
- You getting the kitchen?

764
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,243
That's where the naps are,
in the kitchen.

765
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:22,247
If you can't take the heat,
get on out of the kitchen.

766
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,210
- All right, let's go to the sink.
- Sure.

767
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,215
Come on, it's starting to heat up.

768
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,425
- Burning?
- Yeah. It's all right.

769
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,720
Put your head down.

770
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,225
- Come on, man.
- I turned it.

771
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,568
It's started to sting.
Get out of the way!

772
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,618
- It's burning?
- Hell, yeah, it's burning!

773
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,957
Goddamn it!

774
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:14,007
Hey, nigger, take your head out
of the shit bowl!

775
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,676
That's it. Get up slowly.

776
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:19,304
Hey! Watch it!
No funny business now.

777
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,974
Red, the jig is up.

778
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,851
The average first offender
gets two years for burglary.

779
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,230
We were all first offenders.
That's what the girls drew.

780
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,899
Two years in the women's
reformatory.

781
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,484
Our crime wasn't burglary.

782
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:36,321
It was sleeping with white girls.
They threw the book at us.

783
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,533
Burglary, count one, 8 to 10 years.

784
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,994
Count two, 8 to 10 years.

785
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,705
Count three, 8 to 10 years.

786
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,207
Count four, 8 to 10 years.

787
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,543
Count five, 8 to 10 years.

788
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:54,506
Count six, 8 to 10 years.
Count seven, 8 to 10 years.

789
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,009
Count eight, 8 to 10 years.

790
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:01,680
Count nine, 8 to 10 years.
Count ten, 8 to 10 years.

791
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:06,435
Count 11, 8 to 10 years.
Count 12, 8 to 10 years.

792
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,105
Count 13, 8 to 10 years,
and count 14...

793
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,941
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.

794
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,568
Sentences to run concurrently.

795
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,696
Shorty thought he'd hit us
with over 100 years...

796
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,157
until I explained
what concurrently meant.

797
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,868
It meant a minimum of
10 years hard labor...

798
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,370
at the Charlestown State Prison.

799
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,789
The date was February 1946.

800
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,166
Fuck you.

801
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,299
Cellblock A, secure.

802
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,251
Close five!

803
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,754
Look at Satan.

804
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,089
I see him.

805
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:19,174
He about to bust?

806
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,886
He not gonna bust.
He wouldn't give them the pleasure.

807
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,888
Little!

808
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,394
- State your number.
- Little!

809
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,021
- What?
- Give him a break.

810
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:36,441
- He's a new fish.
- Okay, I'll give him a break.

811
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,528
Now state your number, Little.

812
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,280
- I forgot it.
- State it.

813
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,033
- I forgot it.
- You can read it right there, boy!

814
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,244
- Can't you read, boy?
- Fuck you!

815
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:49,413
I'll teach you a lesson!

816
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,834
I forgot it!

817
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,837
I forgot it!

818
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,249
I forgot it.

819
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,970
They ain't gonna break me down.

820
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:09,057
Yeah, that's the kind of nigger I am.
They ain't gonna break me down.

821
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,811
I'm in this situation,
and I'm getting out.

822
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,439
Anything go wrong, I'm strong.

823
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,442
Time's up, Little.

824
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,902
Now state your number.

825
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,408
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

826
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,583
Water!

827
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,185
You want a smoke?

828
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,862
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son?

829
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:06,290
A friend?

830
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,495
He's a friend, huh, chappy?
If he's such a friend, where is he?

831
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,913
What's he done for me?

832
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,456
A friend!

833
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,126
Tell you what you do,
you tell him to call me.

834
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,921
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is.

835
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,673
Solitary 2-2607.

836
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,009
What he done for me, chappy?

837
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,178
Where is he when I need him, huh?

838
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:32,224
You tell me that! Where is this Jesus?
I'll tell you where he is.

839
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,852
He's out with the police captain!
I'll straighten him out!

840
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,147
What's he done for me?
He ain't done nothing for me!

841
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,151
Done nothing for me.

842
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,531
What a friend we have in Jesus.
Jesus can kiss my ass!

843
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,326
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass.
How about that? Tell him that.

844
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,091
Little.

845
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,468
State your number, Little.

846
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,971
Come on, state it!

847
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,515
A-22...

848
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:56,725
What?

849
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,727
A-228...

850
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,146
Come on.

851
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,247
I know how you feel.

852
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,541
Like you want to lay down and die.

853
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,337
I brought you something.

854
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:28,381
Yeah, I don't need
no more favors from you.

855
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,301
It's nutmeg. Put it in the water.

856
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:34,220
You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

857
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,932
It's not cocaine,
but it'll help some.

858
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:46,524
Drink it slow.
The stuff is strong.

859
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,158
So, what's your hype?

860
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:59,162
I can show you how to get out
of prison. And it's no hype.

861
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,539
Talk, daddy-o. I'm listening.

862
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:06,670
- This ain't bad. You got some more?
- That's the last fix I'm giving you.

863
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,339
So why'd you give it to me?

864
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:13,718
Because you needed it.
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

865
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,389
Nigger, get on out of my face.

866
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,934
I think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

867
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,186
Why the hell don't you use it?

868
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:28,441
You can't bust out of here
like they do in the movies.

869
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,152
Even if you get out,
you're still in prison.

870
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,654
You ain't lying there.

871
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,825
You'll bang against a stone wall.
You're not using your brain!

872
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,952
That's what the white man wants.

873
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:42,539
Look at you, putting all
that poison in your hair.

874
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:47,168
I think you been in prison too long,
because everybody on the outside conks.

875
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,671
Why does everybody on the outside conk?

876
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,008
They don't want to walk around
with a nappy head, looking like...

877
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,300
Looking like me?

878
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,885
Like a nigger?

879
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,097
Why not look like what you are?

880
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,850
What makes you ashamed of being black?

881
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:05,520
Let me tell you something.
I'm not ashamed of being anything.

882
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:11,609
You better let go.
I gotta wash this out.

883
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,821
- Let it burn!
- Nigger, get your hands off of me!

884
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,949
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself.

885
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,036
Put all that poison in your hair,
in your body, trying to be white!

886
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:27,208
- I don't want to hear this shit.
- I thought you were smart.

887
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,836
But you just another cat
strutting down the avenue...

888
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,213
in your clown suit
with all that mess on you!

889
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,631
Looking like a monkey!

890
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:37,802
The white man sees you and laughs
because he knows you ain't white.

891
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,347
- Man, who are you?
- No, the question is, who are you?

892
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,017
I'll tell you.

893
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,020
You are lost in the darkness.

894
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,733
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

895
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,611
- Who?
- Elijah Muhammad...

896
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,363
can get you out of prison.

897
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,533
Out of the prison of your mind.

898
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:04,370
But maybe all you want is another fix.

899
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,514
You get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

900
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:25,558
You stop thinking and acting
for yourself.

901
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:30,188
If you had to scrounge 3 squares
a day outside, you'd cut your throats.

902
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,525
So you let them feed you,
give you dominoes to play with.

903
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:37,153
- Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
- Let's go. Cut the sermon.

904
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,199
He blows his whistle and you sit,
you stand, you grab, gobble...

905
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,408
file out...

906
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,788
- Sleep, and sing out your number.
- I told you to knock it off.

907
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,041
Now...

908
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,960
are you gonna take yard?

909
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,630
I'm staying.

910
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,215
Yeah, me too.

911
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,436
What are you sniffing around for?

912
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,314
I told you, I gave you your last fix.

913
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,004
What's your angle, nigger?

914
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,116
Nigger?
Who's wearing the conk?

915
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:27,412
You the only cat in this prison
I done seen act the way you do.

916
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,874
You ain't afraid of talking like that
in front of guards.

917
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,710
What's he gonna do to me
he hasn't done already?

918
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,883
I mean, you don't cuss none. You don't
talk that "what-ya-know-daddy" jive.

919
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:43,928
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

920
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,433
Yeah.

921
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,936
I know you gotta angle
some kind of way.

922
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,231
Don't con me.

923
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,610
Don't con me and don't try.

924
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,698
Hey, just offering you a cigarette,
my man. Ain't no big deal.

925
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,706
I read, study.

926
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,876
The first thing a black man
must have is self-respect.

927
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,295
Respect his body and his mind.

928
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,089
Quit taking the white man's poisons
into his body.

929
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:24,969
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor,
his white women, his pork.

930
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:26,846
Pork?

931
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,394
My mama used to say don't eat no pork.

932
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:38,024
Your mama was right.
That pig is a filthy beast.

933
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,653
Part rat, part cat and the rest is dog.

934
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,239
All right, pull my coat on this now.

935
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,658
What happen if you give all that up?

936
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,536
I mean, the pork. You get sick
and you get a medical or something?

937
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,249
Like when I was on the outside,
I ran this hustle. I tried...

938
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,794
I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

939
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,838
And I'm gonna tell you God is black.

940
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,925
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

941
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,344
Everything the white man taught you,
you accepted.

942
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,347
He taught you you were
a black heathen, and you believed him.

943
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,350
He taught you to worship a blond,
blue-eyed Jesus...

944
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,144
with white skin
and you believed him.

945
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:18,731
He taught you that black was a curse,
and you believed that.

946
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,484
- Ever look up the word black?
- For what?

947
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,028
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't a con?

948
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,738
What the hell for, man?

949
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:29,617
Come with me.

950
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,040
Destitute of light...

951
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,583
devoid of color.

952
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,585
Enveloped in darkness...

953
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,213
hence utterly dismal or gloomy...

954
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:46,259
- As the future looked black.
- Pretty good with them words, ain't you?

955
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,802
Soiled with dirt...

956
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,220
foul.

957
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,180
Sullen, hostile...

958
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,392
forbidding, as a black day.

959
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,979
Foully or outrageously wicked...

960
01:11:58,188 --> 01:11:59,731
as black cruelty.

961
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,693
Indicating disgrace,
dishonor or culpability.

962
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:08,114
And there's others.
Blackmail. Blackball. Blackguard.

963
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,741
That's something, all right.

964
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,743
Let's look up white.

965
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,247
Here.

966
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,958
Read.

967
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:22,795
White.

968
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,548
The color of pure snow.

969
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:29,761
Reflecting all the rays
of the spectrum.

970
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,429
The opposite of black.

971
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,103
Free from spot or blemish.

972
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,815
Innocent. Pure.

973
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,697
Ain't this something?
Without evil intent.

974
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,074
Harmless.

975
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:55,119
Honest, square-dealing and honorable.
Wait a minute.

976
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,581
This was written by white folks, right?
White folks' book?

977
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,417
- Sure ain't no black man's book.
- What we reading this for?

978
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,295
Because the truth is lying there,
if you read behind the words.

979
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:08,633
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

980
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,511
Yeah?

981
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:18,476
- I mean, there's a whole lot of words here.
- Here. Let's start at the beginning.

982
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:22,980
We'll look them up, write them down
and find out what they mean. Here.

983
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,275
Page one, first word,
aardvark.

984
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,322
Aardvark.

985
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,450
Earth pig.
African, ant-eating mammal.

986
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,327
Abacus.

987
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:40,164
Chinese calculating instrument.

988
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:43,751
Abaddon.

989
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:47,422
The place of the lost in Sheol.

990
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,006
The bottomless pit.

991
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,759
If you take one step toward Allah...

992
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,970
he'll take two steps toward you.

993
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,184
Lights out!

994
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,610
Lights out.

995
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,597
Come on, Pete!

996
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:41,517
Boy'll wear out a baseball.

997
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,437
- Chuck! What's the score, my man?
- 10 to 1.

998
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,399
- We're murdering them! Didn't you hear?
- No. What happened?

999
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:52,862
The Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson!
We're pounding them, celebrating!

1000
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,780
Yeah, that's all right.

1001
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:56,782
Sure.

1002
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,827
White man throw us a bone
and we're supposed to forget...

1003
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,954
400 years of oppression.

1004
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:04,207
Yeah, but a nigger...

1005
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,710
A Negro in the big leagues,
that's something.

1006
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:11,214
I told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

1007
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,425
They let us sing and dance
and smile...

1008
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,929
and then they let one
so-called Negro into the majors.

1009
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,723
That doesn't cancel out history's
greatest crime.

1010
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:24,018
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains...

1011
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,438
one hundred million of us,
broke up our families...

1012
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,065
tortured us...

1013
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:33,110
cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history.

1014
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,198
Let me tell you about black history.

1015
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:39,992
We are the original man.

1016
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,287
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled.

1017
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,290
And there wasn't
a white face anywhere.

1018
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:49,126
But they teach us
that we swung from trees.

1019
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,630
That's a lie.
Black men never did that.

1020
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:55,424
We were a race of kings
when the white man...

1021
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,718
crawled on all fours in Europe.

1022
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,971
Do they know who they are?

1023
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,809
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

1024
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:06,894
- Malcolm Little.
- No.

1025
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,314
That's the name of the slave masters
that owned your family.

1026
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,109
You don't even know who you are.

1027
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,945
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.

1028
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,655
Who are you?

1029
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,369
Look, I ain't shit, heh.

1030
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:30,501
All right, I ain't Malcolm Little,
or Red, or Satan.

1031
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,253
That's right. So who are you?

1032
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:39,218
- I don't know.
- We are a nation...

1033
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,512
the tribe of Shabazz...

1034
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:45,349
lost in this wilderness called
North America.

1035
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,358
Tribe of Shabazz.

1036
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,986
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

1037
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:59,447
a black man
named Elijah Muhammad.

1038
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:03,409
He reveals to us the true
knowledge about ourselves.

1039
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,705
He teaches that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

1040
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,540
is righteousness.

1041
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,376
If the black man's nature
is righteousness...

1042
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:15,338
Then the true nature of
the white man is wickedness.

1043
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,089
I knew you'd get it.

1044
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:21,218
The honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
that the white man is a devil.

1045
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,888
I sure met some in my life.

1046
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:25,723
No.

1047
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:30,102
Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

1048
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:33,939
He teaches us that
all white men are devils.

1049
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:38,736
Have you ever known a good white man?
Think back in all your life.

1050
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,239
Have you ever met one
who wasn't evil?

1051
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,041
The body is a sacred temple...

1052
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,502
it must be purified.

1053
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,923
I will not touch
the white man's poison.

1054
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,508
His drugs...

1055
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,426
his liquor...

1056
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,596
his swine...

1057
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:06,931
his women.

1058
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,434
A Muslim must be strikingly upright...

1059
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,436
an outstanding example...

1060
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:16,107
so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

1061
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:21,487
I will not commit adultery
or fornication.

1062
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,740
I will not lie...

1063
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,659
cheat or steal.

1064
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:30,454
But the key to Islam is submission.

1065
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:38,462
That is why five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

1066
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,173
to bend our knees in submission.

1067
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,138
I can't do that, Brother Baines.

1068
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,932
The lost, found,
must bend their knees...

1069
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,642
to admit their guilt.

1070
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:56,522
To implore Allah's forgiveness
is the hardest thing on earth.

1071
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,822
The hardest and the greatest.

1072
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,496
I don't know
what I would say to Allah.

1073
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,499
Have you ever bent your knees,
Malcolm?

1074
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:20,337
Yes, when I was...

1075
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,883
When I was picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

1076
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,135
Tell Allah that.

1077
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,025
You can grovel and crawl for sin
but not to save your soul?

1078
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,235
Pick the lock, Malcolm. Pick it.

1079
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,529
I want to.

1080
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,160
God knows I want to.

1081
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,883
I received a letter that day
from the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1082
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,385
The dear Holy Apostle wrote to me...

1083
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:11,388
a nobody, a junkie,
a pimp and a convict.

1084
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,558
I have come to give you...

1085
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:18,687
something which can
never be taken away from you.

1086
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:23,859
I bring to you
a sense of your own worth.

1087
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:27,446
The worth of one human being.

1088
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,157
The knowledge of self.

1089
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,847
It was like a blinding light.

1090
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,662
I became aware
that he was in the room with me.

1091
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:38,165
He wore a dark suit,
and on his face I saw a wisdom...

1092
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,044
and pain so old and deep
that I could scarcely look at him.

1093
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:45,798
But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was there with me.

1094
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,883
I tell you...

1095
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,596
the most dangerous creation
in the world...

1096
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,224
in any society...

1097
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,394
is the man with nothing to lose.

1098
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:03,566
You do not need 10 such men
to change the world.

1099
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,443
One will do.

1100
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,447
The earth belongs to us...

1101
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,074
the black man.

1102
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,785
And whatever is around it...

1103
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,955
or on it, or in it...

1104
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,291
belongs to us.

1105
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,626
And then as suddenly as he came...

1106
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:23,961
he was gone.

1107
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,673
And then I could do it.

1108
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,886
We're taught that Paul...

1109
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:35,472
on the road to Damascus,
heard the voice of Christ.

1110
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,684
He was so smitten by the truth
that he fell from his horse.

1111
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,061
Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...

1112
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,980
but I do understand.

1113
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,150
You see, it happened to me.

1114
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,443
Why me?

1115
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,908
I am back in the bosom of Islam,
praise Allah.

1116
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,453
We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.

1117
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:01,540
My wife and my son join me in saying
that when you come out...

1118
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,084
which won't be long,
come straight to us.

1119
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:05,669
Next.

1120
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,093
What'll it be, Little?

1121
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,180
Take it all off.

1122
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,849
- Getting rid of that conk, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1123
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,287
You write, thanking me.

1124
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:27,608
Don't thank me, thank Allah.
He did it all.

1125
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,946
Dear Brother Baines.

1126
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:35,866
Please thank the honorable
Elijah Muhammad for the money...

1127
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,369
and tell him I haven't written him...

1128
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,537
because I've not yet proven myself.

1129
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:44,959
But I have shared his teachings
with some old running buddies in Harlem...

1130
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:48,587
and with my main man, Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.

1131
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,047
He's gone nuts.

1132
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,715
Dear Brothers.

1133
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,635
I thank you for your time and concern.

1134
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:59,473
All praises due to Allah
for the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1135
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,518
I wrote the mayor, the governor
and the president...

1136
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:06,021
but for some reason,
I haven't heard from them.

1137
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,479
Please tell
the honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1138
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:13,737
that I have dedicated my life to telling
the white devil the truth to his face.

1139
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:18,033
I greet you with the ancient words
of peace, As-Salaam-Alaikum.

1140
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:21,870
P.S. I finally copied out
the entire dictionary.

1141
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:26,583
I think the brother is coming along.

1142
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,964
The thief cometh not but for to steal...

1143
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,926
and to kill, and to destroy.

1144
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,928
But I am come...

1145
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,222
that they might have life...

1146
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,476
and that they might have it
more abundantly.

1147
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,773
Saint John 10, verse 10.
Are there any questions?

1148
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,822
Watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

1149
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:01,994
I see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

1150
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,495
Satan has a question.

1151
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,207
Yes, sir. But since
neither of us are God...

1152
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,502
neither of us can say
who's good and who's evil.

1153
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:11,962
Just ask your question.

1154
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,799
We were discussing the Disciples.
What color were they?

1155
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,510
Well, I don't think...

1156
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,304
we know for certain.

1157
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:22,598
- But they were Hebrews?
- That's right.

1158
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,850
As was Jesus.
Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1159
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,603
Just ask your question.

1160
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:29,229
What color were the Hebrews?

1161
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,900
I have told you that
we don't know that for certain.

1162
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:37,196
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

1163
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,698
Just a moment. Just a moment.

1164
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,827
God is white. Isn't it obvious?

1165
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:46,872
That's obvious,
but it's not obvious that God is white.

1166
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,720
The honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1167
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:51,502
that Jesus didn't have
blond hair and blue eyes.

1168
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:54,254
The honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches that images of Jesus...

1169
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,257
in prisons and churches
throughout the world...

1170
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:59,176
are not historically correct.

1171
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,053
Because history teaches us...

1172
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,431
Jesus was born in a region where
the people had color.

1173
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,184
There's proof in the Bible
you ask us to read...

1174
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:10,229
in Revelations, first chapter,
verses 14 and 15...

1175
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,356
that Jesus had hair like wool...

1176
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,358
and feet the color of brass.

1177
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,152
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

1178
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:21,323
I'm proving to you that Jesus was not,
to quote an Indian brother...

1179
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:24,034
he was not a paleface.

1180
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:27,454
Amen.

1181
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,206
Isn't that interesting.

1182
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,044
Brother Malcolm.

1183
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:35,712
Brother Malcolm.

1184
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,216
He's waiting for you.

1185
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,762
My son...

1186
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,602
You have been a thief...

1187
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,147
a drug dealer and a hustler...

1188
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,610
and the world
is still full of temptation.

1189
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:48,952
When God spoke to the devil about
how faithful Job was...

1190
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,495
the devil argued...

1191
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,790
that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

1192
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,376
that kept him pure.

1193
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,462
In fact, the devil said...

1194
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:03,258
Remove that hedge
and he will curse his maker.

1195
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:06,136
Well, Malcolm...

1196
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:10,807
your hedge has been removed.

1197
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:16,980
And I believe...

1198
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:18,190
you...

1199
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:20,817
will remain faithful.

1200
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,819
Yes, sir.

1201
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:30,160
Thank you, sister.
How many of these should we make?

1202
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,412
- Five hundred.
- Make it 1000.

1203
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,916
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

1204
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,752
Yes, sir.

1205
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,713
Brother Earl's dedicated.
We need good men like him.

1206
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:45,217
I'm a willing servant for
the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1207
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,344
Go ahead, brothers. Keep it busy.

1208
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,639
Take a real good look
at not just where you live...

1209
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:54,142
but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives.

1210
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,646
I don't want you to think
you're some bad-luck accident.

1211
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:00,983
Then I want you to go downtown,
to Central Park West...

1212
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:05,320
- And take a good look at how he lives.
- Go in other communities.

1213
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,448
You've never seen a
Booker T. Washington linguine store...

1214
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,075
in an Italian community.

1215
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,369
You've never went
in a Jewish community...

1216
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,913
and seen no
Frederick Douglass delicatessen.

1217
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,667
Why's everybody in this community
making money but us?

1218
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:21,878
It's time for the black man
and the woman to stand up...

1219
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,089
and take control of our dollars.

1220
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:28,135
It's time for us to use our dollars
for our liberation.

1221
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:31,805
We can do what everyone else can do
if we become producers...

1222
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:34,975
and if we become
the masters of our own destiny.

1223
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:37,894
We can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else.

1224
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,022
But where are our clothing stores?

1225
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:44,526
We can get milk from cows,
but where are our grocery stores?

1226
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:48,572
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

1227
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:51,908
The only thing they respect
is our dollars!

1228
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,413
The so-called freedom
you and I should have.

1229
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,832
The Statue of Liberty standing like this.

1230
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,252
For us, it may as well say,
stop, don't come no further.

1231
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,505
This is what he be saying,
don't come no further.

1232
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:10,218
What I want you to do, brothers and sisters,
I want you to come down to the temple.

1233
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:12,095
Oh, I'm so surprised!

1234
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:15,015
I'm so surprised.
Y'all been in church two hours...

1235
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:19,311
and you're expecting to see heaven
out here, and you're still here on earth.

1236
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,105
Why don't you come on down
to the temple at 2:00?

1237
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,566
You'll hear truth,
the black man's truth.

1238
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:28,653
No, you can't deny it. You been
on your knees for the last two hours...

1239
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,114
begging some God to help you
in the hereafter.

1240
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:34,868
But the hereafter is right now.
The hereafter is here and now.

1241
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,787
Let me talk to you, brother.

1242
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:39,873
I know you're a smart man
and a wise man.

1243
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,124
You look good.

1244
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:44,669
Now, you're in church every day,
praying to this God.

1245
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,963
But these so-called white Christians...

1246
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,925
they're hanging our black Christians
from trees.

1247
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:53,387
This is the man that hates you.
He doesn't do anything for you.

1248
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:55,931
He tells you to foam at
the mouth and sing...

1249
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,976
and hope for something in the hereafter.
We can have it right now.

1250
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:02,437
- Come on down, 2:00.
- See you later.

1251
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:05,857
As-Salaam-Alaikum.
That means, peace be onto you.

1252
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,152
We have two children.
Carla, who's 2 1/2, and...

1253
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,072
Don't be ashamed when I call you black.
You are.

1254
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:15,283
You're black and you're beautiful.
Black is beautiful.

1255
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:18,829
You don't have to come here
begging these folks for a job.

1256
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:21,998
You can wash their clothes
and scrub floors for them.

1257
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:25,419
You can rock their little brats
to sleep the rest of your life.

1258
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:27,170
You'll still end up poor.

1259
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,382
Yet you're here on the auction block
being examined...

1260
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:32,759
like you're a horse or a slave.

1261
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:36,012
You see this here?
This is who you are. Beautiful.

1262
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,808
Your beautiful black selves,
with pride and dignity.

1263
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,726
In fact...

1264
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:45,439
I'd also expect you to work one
Saturday every month...

1265
01:30:45,648 --> 01:30:48,358
and occasionally in the evening...

1266
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:58,034
See, these are the questions
you and I have to ask.

1267
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,703
How did we get this mind?

1268
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:03,707
You're not an American, but an African
who happens to be in America.

1269
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,709
You have to understand the difference.

1270
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:09,421
We didn't come over on the Niña,
the Pinta and the whatchamacallit.

1271
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:13,425
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

1272
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:16,344
- Yes!
- Landed right on top of us.

1273
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:19,890
Shorty?

1274
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:22,559
Is that you, brother?

1275
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:26,730
Now, this is exactly what I'm talking
about, the slave mentality.

1276
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:30,066
The slave mind. This brother and I,
we had the slave mind.

1277
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:33,195
We used to rob together.
We used to sleep with white women.

1278
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,071
We even went to prison together.

1279
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:38,283
Don't be surprised.
Some of you are still in prison.

1280
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:39,910
Prisons of your mind.

1281
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:42,162
Stand up, brother. Come on.

1282
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,248
The brother's a little shy.

1283
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,584
Come on, brother. Give me a hug.

1284
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:52,506
That's all right, brother.
That's all right.

1285
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:54,633
Look, he's still got his hair fried.

1286
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,594
That's the slave mind.
That's the slave mind.

1287
01:31:57,803 --> 01:32:00,931
Red, that's the best preacher hype
I ever did hear.

1288
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,016
No hype, brother. It's the truth.

1289
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,268
Come back to the temple and hear more.

1290
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:07,270
I can't pay that shit no mind.

1291
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:09,856
You need to pay it all your mind.
What mind you have left.

1292
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:12,442
Take it easy. This is me. Shorty.

1293
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:14,361
Let's go around the corner...

1294
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:19,241
No, sir. Not anymore.
I've been clean for eight years.

1295
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,076
- Eight years?
- Eight years.

1296
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:25,288
My trouble is, I love pigs feet
and white women too much.

1297
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:27,791
So I damn sure can't be no Muslim.

1298
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,920
That's because you're lost, brother.
That's because you're lost.

1299
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:34,089
But we can find you.

1300
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:40,345
What do you hear about the old gang?

1301
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,430
You heard about Sammy?

1302
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:47,143
Dead. Knocked over in bed with
a chick 25 years younger than he was.

1303
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:50,438
Had 25 grand in his pocket also.

1304
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,649
Guess it was his lucky number.

1305
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,043
What about...?

1306
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:56,820
What was that brother's name?

1307
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,488
Cadillac?

1308
01:32:58,656 --> 01:32:59,739
Gone too?

1309
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:04,119
Hooked on heroin. Been in
and out of Lexington five or six times.

1310
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:07,747
- Sophia?
- Still happily married to that rich ofay.

1311
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:10,125
- She married him?
- She married him.

1312
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,043
Went for the money.

1313
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,838
- The money.
- Thank you, honey.

1314
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:18,174
I haven't seen West Indian Archie.

1315
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:21,261
Grapevine says he's living
somewhere in the Bronx.

1316
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:23,346
If you wanna call that living.

1317
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:27,142
- It's been good seeing you.
- Same here, Red.

1318
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:38,236
Get the hell away from me, bitch!

1319
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:44,242
I'll pay you tomorrow!

1320
01:33:58,758 --> 01:33:59,924
How you doing, Archie?

1321
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:02,260
My man, Red.

1322
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,431
Come here, man.

1323
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,021
No, don't get up. It's all right.

1324
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,113
Is...

1325
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,034
really you, Red?

1326
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:28,536
Yes, it's me.

1327
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,709
I came to...

1328
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:37,128
Just to thank you...

1329
01:34:38,964 --> 01:34:40,674
for saving my life.

1330
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:44,511
When I think back to when we were
on the streets of Harlem trying...

1331
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,179
to gun each other down...

1332
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,598
I wasn't going to shoot you, man.

1333
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,267
It was...

1334
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,395
just my rep.

1335
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:55,355
You know?

1336
01:34:56,774 --> 01:34:59,567
All I had was my rep.

1337
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,320
But now...

1338
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,990
you tell me this.

1339
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:09,661
You did really have that number?

1340
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,331
I don't know, Archie...

1341
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,709
I don't remember,
and it's not important.

1342
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:19,754
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

1343
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:23,675
You know, I have some angles...

1344
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:27,470
ain't been figured yet.

1345
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:36,563
It's all right.

1346
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,611
Help me with my arm.

1347
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:47,365
I need to exercise my arm.

1348
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:53,663
Yeah.

1349
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,166
That's better?

1350
01:35:56,375 --> 01:35:58,668
Yep. It feels good.

1351
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,920
Good.

1352
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,676
What happened to our women?

1353
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,345
Women who could've been doctors,
or lawyers...

1354
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:12,766
or teachers or mothers.
Who'll raise our children?

1355
01:36:12,975 --> 01:36:14,517
What happened to our men?

1356
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:18,938
Men who could've been mathematicians,
electricians, physicians.

1357
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,524
What's the little boy gonna do...

1358
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:24,778
when he's looking for his father,
and his father's downtown in jail?

1359
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:26,362
What'll the little girl do...

1360
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:29,532
when she's looking for her mother,
and she's out there selling herself?

1361
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,700
Laura. Wait for me.

1362
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:34,370
I'm telling you, that devil
has made dead souls out of you and I.

1363
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:35,663
You're dead.

1364
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:37,457
You're dead, spiritually.

1365
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:41,377
You're dead to the knowledge
of yourself and your people...

1366
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:43,630
and to the knowledge
of your God.

1367
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:47,217
Why, my brothers and sisters,
he should get down on his knees.

1368
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:49,052
He should beg our mercy.

1369
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,012
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

1370
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,848
his kind has committed
God's greatest crime...

1371
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,560
against your and my kind
every day of his life!

1372
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,481
He should get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime.

1373
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,732
But does he do that?

1374
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:06,069
Does he do that?
No. No, he scorns you.

1375
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:08,488
He splits your head with
his nightstick.

1376
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:11,282
He busts you in the head
with that billy club.

1377
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,159
And he calls you a nigger...

1378
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:17,247
Calls you a coon. That's what he
says to you. Boy! Nigger!

1379
01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:19,415
Four hundred years is long enough.

1380
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:23,086
You've sat down and laid down
and bowed down for 400 years.

1381
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:27,006
I think it's time to stand up.
I think it's time to stand up.

1382
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:29,050
- We're with you!
- All right.

1383
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,053
- Bless you. Bless you.
- I'm with you.

1384
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,975
Come on up.

1385
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:41,980
Glory! My Lord! Praise Him!
Praise Him! Praise Him!

1386
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,952
Yes, sir. Next Wednesday, 8:00.

1387
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:58,454
- I'll be there.
- I'll see you there.

1388
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,874
Brother Baines? Excuse me, sister.

1389
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:04,127
Do you think we can get
a loudspeaker set up outside?

1390
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:05,587
I'm sure we can.

1391
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:07,881
Brother Malcolm, this is Sister Betty.

1392
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:10,800
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

1393
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,137
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

1394
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:15,638
Good.

1395
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,600
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.
- Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

1396
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,811
Brother Minister...

1397
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:25,481
the sister wonders if you know
what Harriet Tubman did...

1398
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:28,651
between taking souls
to the Promised Land?

1399
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:31,112
No. What's that, sister?

1400
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,865
She ate.

1401
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:38,620
Excuse me.

1402
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:48,838
She's interesting.

1403
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:52,383
Minister, I was hoping
you'd come and speak to my class.

1404
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:53,593
Yes.

1405
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,553
Yes, I'll speak to your class.

1406
01:38:56,388 --> 01:38:59,182
- But I'm a hard man on the women.
- Are you?

1407
01:38:59,892 --> 01:39:02,435
We must be very careful
when it comes to women.

1408
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,979
Too many of our women...

1409
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:08,024
have too much of the devil in them.

1410
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:10,568
Bleaching and dyeing...

1411
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:14,405
and ironing their hair.

1412
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:19,452
Running around in the streets
half-naked.

1413
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:22,789
Talking too much.

1414
01:39:22,998 --> 01:39:24,624
Listening to the wrong men...

1415
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:28,378
making them deceitful,
untrustworthy, fresh.

1416
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:30,922
And you men are to blame too.

1417
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:35,009
We don't protect, we don't value,
we don't even support them.

1418
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:40,181
See, the building of a new nation
begins with the woman.

1419
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:42,433
Because the mother...

1420
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:45,269
is the first teacher of the child.

1421
01:39:45,437 --> 01:39:49,857
The message she gives that child, the child
gives to the world, so we have to be careful.

1422
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:53,403
When it comes to choosing a mate...

1423
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:58,324
Samson, the strongest man
that ever lived, was destroyed...

1424
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,035
by the woman that slept in his arms.

1425
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,705
Should I tell my sisters then...

1426
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:06,374
- That we don't believe in marriage?
- No.

1427
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:09,168
No, we don't oppose marriage.

1428
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,212
We're not Catholic priests.

1429
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,172
We don't believe in celibacy.

1430
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,633
Mr. Muhammad teaches
that if a woman...

1431
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:18,594
is the right height for a man,
right complexion...

1432
01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:20,096
If she's...

1433
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:23,099
half the man's age, plus seven.

1434
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:25,935
And if...

1435
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:30,773
she understands that man's
essential nature is strong...

1436
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:33,151
and she's willing to support that.

1437
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:35,236
And if she...

1438
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:38,156
can sew and cook and...

1439
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:39,991
loves children...

1440
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,243
and stays out of trouble...

1441
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:45,538
I think you've made your points,
Brother Minister.

1442
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:46,789
Good.

1443
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:50,004
- You haven't any time for marriage.
- No.

1444
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:54,714
So, what I'll do is
write the chapters down for you.

1445
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:55,923
All right.

1446
01:40:56,091 --> 01:40:59,385
As well as the New Testament
chapters in St. Matthew.

1447
01:40:59,678 --> 01:41:00,970
Brother Minister...

1448
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,973
I hope that doesn't mean
you won't come visit my class though.

1449
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:07,143
Oh, no. No, I'd love to come to your class.
I love to teach.

1450
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,980
I love sharing. This is the wonderful
thing about Mr. Muhammad.

1451
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:15,985
When he gives you this knowledge, you
can't help but to run out and share it...

1452
01:41:16,153 --> 01:41:18,488
Excuse me, Brother Minister...

1453
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:20,406
would it be okay if we...

1454
01:41:20,616 --> 01:41:22,492
just sat down for a moment?

1455
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:26,412
- It's a pretty big building and...
- Oh, yes.

1456
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,499
Sister, I'm sorry.
I've had you on your feet all day.

1457
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:31,000
Oh, no. No, no.

1458
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:32,335
My mistake.

1459
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,796
You've been on your feet for days.

1460
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:40,259
And you didn't even finish
your salad.

1461
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:44,180
So let's talk about you
for a change.

1462
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:46,057
How tall are you?

1463
01:41:47,643 --> 01:41:48,810
Why do you ask?

1464
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:50,386
Idle question.

1465
01:41:50,854 --> 01:41:55,191
Well, if it's just an idle question,
I hope you won't force me to answer.

1466
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:58,861
No, I won't force you.

1467
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:03,449
Well...

1468
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:07,537
Brother Baines says that
I'm tall enough for a tall man.

1469
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:10,282
He's briefed you also?

1470
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,376
How old are you, sister?

1471
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:17,463
You know, there are
a few things about women...

1472
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:19,674
that you don't understand.

1473
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:23,177
Some of us,
we're quite possessive, very vain...

1474
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,387
Are you?

1475
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,223
And persistent when
we've set our mind to something.

1476
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:30,226
What have you set your mind to?

1477
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:34,105
Being a good Muslim...

1478
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,691
a good nurse...

1479
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:40,027
and a good wife.

1480
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,238
Brother Malcolm?

1481
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:43,990
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

1482
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:46,826
Brother Johnson was attacked
by the police.

1483
01:42:48,745 --> 01:42:49,787
Excuse me.

1484
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:51,831
- A scuffle.
- He was just watching.

1485
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,334
- The cop said move on!
- He didn't move quick enough for him.

1486
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:57,753
Crack! He was bleeding
like a stuck hog.

1487
01:42:57,963 --> 01:43:00,131
So, what you gonna do?

1488
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,759
He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim!

1489
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:06,888
But you ain't gonna do nothing
but make a speech.

1490
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:10,600
Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothing...

1491
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:13,811
unless somebody bothers Muslims.

1492
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,375
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

1493
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:40,463
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the minister from Muslim Temple No. 7.

1494
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:42,340
Never heard of you.

1495
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,050
- Where is he?
- Not here.

1496
01:43:44,259 --> 01:43:46,469
Wait a second. What is your name?

1497
01:43:46,678 --> 01:43:48,971
Don't worry about what my name is.

1498
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:52,975
Two witnesses saw Johnson brought here
beat up, but not brought out.

1499
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:56,312
You didn't hear the sergeant?
Outside!

1500
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,023
I suggest you look outside
that window.

1501
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:14,455
- Jimmy, come here a second.
- Yes, we intend to see Brother Johnson.

1502
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,415
Who the hell are they?

1503
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:19,001
They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

1504
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,591
Eddie, let me take a look
at that blotter.

1505
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:37,603
Yeah. We got a Muslim.
Relief must've put it down.

1506
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:40,189
- Must have.
- But you can't see him.

1507
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,942
- Because you ain't his lawyer.
- No lawyer, no see.

1508
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:47,530
Until I'm satisfied that Brother Johnson
is receiving proper medical care...

1509
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:49,365
nobody will move.

1510
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:06,382
Get an ambulance. Now!

1511
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:27,153
Break it up. You got what you wanted.

1512
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:29,822
No, I'm not satisfied.

1513
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:32,700
To the hospital.

1514
01:46:05,817 --> 01:46:07,026
Suzie, come on.

1515
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:34,697
We want justice! We want justice!

1516
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:36,866
All right, that's enough.

1517
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:38,701
Move these people out of here.

1518
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:43,414
Fruit of Islam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws yet.

1519
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:46,333
- What about them?
- That's your headache, captain.

1520
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,752
But if Brother Johnson dies,
I pity you.

1521
01:47:50,088 --> 01:47:51,172
Doctor?

1522
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:53,841
He'll live.
He's getting the best care we have.

1523
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:55,176
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

1524
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:57,970
All right, okay.

1525
01:47:58,388 --> 01:48:00,055
Now, let's disperse this mob!

1526
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:04,393
We want justice! We want justice!

1527
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:55,736
That's too much power
for one man to have.

1528
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:59,073
Brother Minister,
I'm ready to take some heads.

1529
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:01,492
We gotta do something
to put fear in those devils.

1530
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:05,955
I'm ready to do something also.
The word out of Chicago was to be patient.

1531
01:49:06,164 --> 01:49:09,041
- I'm tired of being patient.
- Then you get on the phone...

1532
01:49:09,834 --> 01:49:12,586
You get on the phone, call Chicago
and let Mr. Muhammad know.

1533
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:31,814
Have a seat, son.

1534
01:49:35,485 --> 01:49:37,736
The only thing I like integrated...

1535
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:40,990
is my coffee.

1536
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:43,784
What can I do for you?

1537
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,747
Well, Mr. X...

1538
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,750
my name is Benjamin.

1539
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:54,336
I was out there tonight.

1540
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,255
Take it easy now.

1541
01:49:56,631 --> 01:49:59,091
And I saw what it is that you did.

1542
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:02,052
The way you talked
to them policeman and all.

1543
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:07,933
Well, Mr. X...

1544
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,396
I want to be a Muslim.

1545
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:15,524
I ain't never seen a nigger...
I mean...

1546
01:50:15,775 --> 01:50:17,109
colored person...

1547
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:20,112
Negro...

1548
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:23,407
talk to no police like that before.

1549
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:26,535
And you want to be a Muslim?
Join the Nation Of Islam?

1550
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:29,663
You know what that means?
To be a Muslim?

1551
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,875
Do you?

1552
01:50:36,078 --> 01:50:39,423
No, not exactly.
But I wanna be one...

1553
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:40,883
just like you.

1554
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:45,429
You shouldn't join any organization
unless you know exactly what it's about.

1555
01:50:51,728 --> 01:50:53,020
Thank you.

1556
01:50:54,689 --> 01:50:57,024
You shouldn't give up so easily either.

1557
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:02,321
We could use more young warriors
like yourself.

1558
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:04,990
Come on by the temple
next Wednesday 8:00.

1559
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:06,408
8:00 sharp.

1560
01:51:06,618 --> 01:51:08,452
Yes, sir. 8:00 sharp.

1561
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,955
Thank you, Mr. X. And I won't
make you out a liar either.

1562
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:14,375
No, I don't think you will.

1563
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:28,013
Tonight, I shall...

1564
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:32,476
introduce you
as my national minister.

1565
01:51:33,728 --> 01:51:36,188
It will be a difficult task.

1566
01:51:36,606 --> 01:51:38,190
Your assignment...

1567
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:41,694
is to build temples
all over this nation.

1568
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:44,905
More work than you've ever done.

1569
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:46,006
Yes, sir.

1570
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:48,409
You will be in the public eye.

1571
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:51,245
Beware of them cameras.

1572
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:54,957
Oh, them cameras...

1573
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,960
are bad as any narcotic.

1574
01:51:59,462 --> 01:52:00,796
Yeah.

1575
01:52:00,964 --> 01:52:03,590
White devil will be watching
your every step.

1576
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:06,677
And your own brothers will be...

1577
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:09,221
jealous...

1578
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:11,640
hostile.

1579
01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:13,851
Go slowly.

1580
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:15,310
Yes, sir.

1581
01:52:16,646 --> 01:52:18,063
Here's a glass.

1582
01:52:24,863 --> 01:52:26,822
It's dirty water.

1583
01:52:27,031 --> 01:52:28,157
Foul.

1584
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:32,369
If you offer this to the people...

1585
01:52:32,579 --> 01:52:34,413
they have no choice.

1586
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:36,331
They'll drink from it...

1587
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,168
if they're thirsty.

1588
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:41,628
But if you offer them...

1589
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,131
this glass...

1590
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:50,179
and let them make
their own decision...

1591
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:54,266
they will choose the pure vessel.

1592
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:57,728
Islam...

1593
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:00,439
is the only religion...

1594
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:04,735
that addresses
the needs and the problems...

1595
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:06,945
of the so-called Negro in America.

1596
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:09,198
- Especially in the slums...
- Right.

1597
01:53:09,365 --> 01:53:10,783
Ghettos.

1598
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:15,579
Islam is the only way out
for drugs and crime...

1599
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:17,998
unemployment, prostitution...

1600
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,833
alcohol...

1601
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:21,418
gambling...

1602
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:23,879
and adultery, fornication.

1603
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:27,508
This sweet gentle man...

1604
01:53:27,675 --> 01:53:30,886
at whose feet I kneeled
gave me the truth from his own mouth.

1605
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,596
Present them the pure vessel.

1606
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:36,892
I adored him in the sense
of the Latin root of the word adorare...

1607
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:39,144
which means to worship and to fear.

1608
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:41,522
He was the first man I ever feared.

1609
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:44,358
I don't mean fear
such as one has of a gun...

1610
01:53:44,567 --> 01:53:48,362
but the fear one has
of the power of the sun.

1611
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:51,907
I pledged myself to him,
even if it cost me my life.

1612
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:56,634
- Hello?
- Hello, Betty?

1613
01:53:56,746 --> 01:53:58,747
- Yes?
- Yeah, this is Malcolm.

1614
01:53:59,123 --> 01:54:01,792
- I know.
- Right, I'm here in Detroit.

1615
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:08,048
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

1616
01:54:08,424 --> 01:54:09,883
You heard what I said, right?

1617
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:12,469
- Did you hear my answer?
- Yes, I think so.

1618
01:54:12,679 --> 01:54:14,130
Brother Malcolm...

1619
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,432
- Are you eating?
- Yeah, I've been eating.

1620
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:18,976
Good.

1621
01:54:19,727 --> 01:54:21,103
I love you, Betty.

1622
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,691
I love you back.

1623
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:37,369
It's not gonna be easy.

1624
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:39,121
No choice.

1625
01:54:39,622 --> 01:54:41,206
I'll be away a lot.

1626
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:43,292
I know.

1627
01:54:46,129 --> 01:54:47,889
In fact, I'm leaving in the morning.

1628
01:54:48,047 --> 01:54:49,465
Oh, hush, now...

1629
01:54:50,633 --> 01:54:52,801
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia...

1630
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:57,222
Trenton, Newark,
up through number 7 up to Boston.

1631
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:58,724
Malcolm.

1632
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:06,690
You're with me...

1633
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:09,985
even when you're away.

1634
01:55:26,502 --> 01:55:28,837
I've never told you this...

1635
01:55:31,424 --> 01:55:34,259
but the very first time
I ever saw you...

1636
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:37,429
standing up on the podium...

1637
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:42,267
you were cleaning your glasses...

1638
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,689
and I felt so sorry for you.

1639
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,800
Sorry for me?

1640
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,401
Why?

1641
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:56,114
Because no one as young as you
should be so serious.

1642
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,119
But I don't think that anymore.

1643
01:56:01,746 --> 01:56:03,121
What do you think?

1644
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:09,044
I want to have a lot of babies with you.

1645
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:14,299
Dear heart.

1646
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:18,303
I love you.

1647
01:56:20,556 --> 01:56:23,433
We're waiting on you folks.
Trying to starve us?

1648
01:56:26,896 --> 01:56:29,022
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty...

1649
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:33,735
we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and fruitful marriage.

1650
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:39,074
Congratulations, Brother Minister.

1651
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:41,243
- Congratulations.
- Front page.

1652
01:56:41,411 --> 01:56:43,662
Check them out. Front page!

1653
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:49,835
I must emphasize at the out start...

1654
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:53,046
that the honorable Elijah Muhammad
is not a politician.

1655
01:56:53,673 --> 01:56:57,592
So I'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican nor as a Democrat.

1656
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:59,594
Tell it, brother!

1657
01:57:00,096 --> 01:57:03,932
- Not as a Mason nor as an Elk.
- Well, tell us what you're here for!

1658
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:06,810
Not as a Protestant nor a Catholic.

1659
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,730
Not as a Christian nor a Jew.

1660
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:12,274
Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist.

1661
01:57:12,442 --> 01:57:14,276
In fact, not even as an American.

1662
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:17,696
Because if I was an American...

1663
01:57:17,947 --> 01:57:20,782
the problem that confronts our people
today wouldn't even exist.

1664
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:24,786
So now we ain't Americans, huh?

1665
01:57:24,954 --> 01:57:28,415
So I have to stand here today
as what I was when I was born.

1666
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:29,916
A black man.

1667
01:57:34,881 --> 01:57:39,593
Before there was any such thing as a
Republican or a Democrat, we were black.

1668
01:57:39,802 --> 01:57:43,597
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

1669
01:57:43,806 --> 01:57:48,018
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

1670
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:52,606
In fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

1671
01:57:52,857 --> 01:57:56,359
And after America has long passed
from the scene...

1672
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:58,153
there will still be black people.

1673
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,741
I'm gonna tell you like it really is!

1674
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:08,288
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us.

1675
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:11,291
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man.

1676
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:12,793
This is what they do.

1677
01:58:13,002 --> 01:58:15,879
They send drugs in Harlem down here
to pacify us!

1678
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:18,799
They send alcohol down here
to pacify us!

1679
01:58:19,008 --> 01:58:21,968
They send prostitution down here
to pacify us!

1680
01:58:22,178 --> 01:58:25,555
You can't get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1681
01:58:25,723 --> 01:58:29,059
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1682
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:32,437
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1683
01:58:32,647 --> 01:58:35,482
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle...

1684
01:58:35,691 --> 01:58:38,235
that's a government seal
you're breaking.

1685
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:42,322
So I say, and I say it again,
you been had.

1686
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:44,032
You been took.

1687
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:45,867
You been hoodwinked.

1688
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:48,787
Bamboozled. Led astray.

1689
01:58:49,038 --> 01:58:51,540
Run amuck. This is what he does.

1690
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:54,501
You know, some people
call this hate-teaching.

1691
01:58:54,836 --> 01:58:56,795
- This isn't hate-teaching.
- That's right.

1692
01:58:57,004 --> 01:58:58,046
This is love-teaching.

1693
01:58:59,423 --> 01:59:01,758
I wouldn't tell you this
if I didn't love you.

1694
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:04,761
I wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if I didn't love you.

1695
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:07,848
Everything I teach you...

1696
01:59:08,057 --> 01:59:10,100
everything I have said to you...

1697
01:59:10,309 --> 01:59:13,311
has been taught to me
by this dear man.

1698
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,855
This divine man.

1699
01:59:16,649 --> 01:59:19,901
All praise is due to Allah
for the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1700
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:22,404
Attallah's fine.

1701
01:59:22,572 --> 01:59:25,157
And she misses you as much as I do.

1702
01:59:25,575 --> 01:59:29,786
But the news that you've dedicated
four new temples is almost as good...

1703
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:33,999
as having you with us. Oh, dear
heart, please take care of yourself.

1704
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:36,207
White people try to hide their guilt...

1705
01:59:36,335 --> 01:59:38,378
by accusing
the honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1706
01:59:38,588 --> 01:59:40,213
of being a black supremacist...

1707
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:43,216
simply because he's trying
to uplift the mentality...

1708
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:46,261
the social and economic condition
of his people.

1709
01:59:46,429 --> 01:59:50,557
And the Jews who have been guilty
of exploiting black people...

1710
01:59:50,766 --> 01:59:54,019
try to hide their guilt by accusing
the honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1711
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:56,313
of being anti-Semitic...

1712
01:59:56,522 --> 01:59:59,941
simply because he's trying
to teach you and I...

1713
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:02,110
He's trying to teach you and I...

1714
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:05,488
to be in charge of the businesses
in our own community.

1715
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:08,408
To own the businesses
in our own community.

1716
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:10,785
To have economic leadership
in our own community.

1717
02:00:10,953 --> 02:00:14,080
No! No, this isn't black supremacy.

1718
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:15,999
This is black intelligence.

1719
02:00:33,517 --> 02:00:35,810
The black people in this country...

1720
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:38,647
have been the victims of violence...

1721
02:00:39,148 --> 02:00:41,733
at the hands
of the American white man...

1722
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:45,070
for 400 years.

1723
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:49,908
Four hundred years.

1724
02:00:52,203 --> 02:00:55,330
We thought by following
those ignorant Negro preachers...

1725
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:57,999
that it was God-like
to turn the other cheek...

1726
02:00:58,167 --> 02:01:00,669
to the group that was brutalizing us.

1727
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:04,798
A hundred years ago,
they used to put on white sheets...

1728
02:01:05,007 --> 02:01:07,133
and sic bloodhounds on us.

1729
02:01:07,343 --> 02:01:09,719
Nowadays, they've traded in the sheets.

1730
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:11,680
Some have traded in the sheets.

1731
02:01:13,057 --> 02:01:15,058
They've traded in the sheets.

1732
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:16,643
Please, please.

1733
02:01:16,852 --> 02:01:20,188
They've traded in those white sheets
for police uniforms.

1734
02:01:20,523 --> 02:01:23,608
They traded in the bloodhounds
for police dogs.

1735
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,486
And just like Uncle Tom
back during slavery time...

1736
02:01:26,696 --> 02:01:31,199
We must remain true to nonviolence.
I'm asking everybody in the line.

1737
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:34,119
If you can't be nonviolent,
don't get in it.

1738
02:01:34,328 --> 02:01:37,330
To love our enemy and pray
for those who use us spitefully.

1739
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:41,710
You've got chicken-pecking Uncle Tom,
so-called Negro leaders today.

1740
02:01:41,877 --> 02:01:44,004
And it's another great day.

1741
02:01:44,213 --> 02:01:47,966
You've got these Uncle Tom
Negro leaders today...

1742
02:01:48,175 --> 02:01:50,760
that tell us we ought to pray
for our enemies.

1743
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:54,055
We ought to love our enemy
and integrate with the enemy...

1744
02:01:54,223 --> 02:01:57,851
who bombs us, who kills
and shoots us, who lynches us...

1745
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,937
who rapes our women
and children. No!

1746
02:02:01,397 --> 02:02:03,148
No!

1747
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:05,400
No! That's not intelligent.

1748
02:02:05,651 --> 02:02:07,444
That's not intelligent.

1749
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:10,363
The honorable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to teach you and I...

1750
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:13,908
that just as the white man
and any other man on this earth...

1751
02:02:14,076 --> 02:02:17,537
has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

1752
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:20,665
the natural right, and any other
rights you can think of...

1753
02:02:20,916 --> 02:02:22,625
to protect himself...

1754
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:26,421
just as this white man has
the right to defend himself...

1755
02:02:26,672 --> 02:02:29,424
we have the right
to defend ourselves too.

1756
02:02:29,967 --> 02:02:31,259
This is only natural.

1757
02:02:31,427 --> 02:02:34,346
This is what the honorable Elijah
Muhammad is trying to teach you and I.

1758
02:02:34,555 --> 02:02:36,556
He's not teaching us
to hate the white man.

1759
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:39,267
He's teaching us to love ourselves.

1760
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:44,439
Mr. X, before we begin
our discussion tonight...

1761
02:02:44,648 --> 02:02:47,984
The black muslims.
Hate Mongers...

1762
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:52,280
would you mind explaining for us
the meaning of your name...

1763
02:02:52,448 --> 02:02:54,616
which is the letter X?

1764
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:58,411
Yes, during slavery time,
the slave master...

1765
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:01,122
gave the Negro,
so-called Negro...

1766
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:04,501
named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

1767
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,337
The honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1768
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:11,257
that once we come into the knowledge
of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves...

1769
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:14,094
we replace our slave name
with an X...

1770
02:03:14,303 --> 02:03:17,180
X in mathematics representing
the unknown.

1771
02:03:17,473 --> 02:03:20,558
Since we've been disconnected,
or cut off from our own history...

1772
02:03:20,768 --> 02:03:23,728
our own past, our own culture,
our own land...

1773
02:03:23,938 --> 02:03:27,649
we use the X, the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

1774
02:03:27,858 --> 02:03:31,152
I see. Thank you. Dr. Payson?

1775
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,988
Mr. X is a...
He's a demagogue.

1776
02:03:34,198 --> 02:03:36,991
He has no place to go,
so he exaggerates.

1777
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:39,202
He's a disservice to every good...

1778
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:42,497
law-abiding, church-going
American Negro in the country.

1779
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:45,708
Mr. Malcolm X...

1780
02:03:46,544 --> 02:03:49,671
why do you teach black supremacy?

1781
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,840
Why...? Why do you teach hate?

1782
02:03:52,007 --> 02:03:54,509
Well, for the white man...

1783
02:03:54,677 --> 02:03:57,178
to ask the black man...

1784
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,097
why he hates him...

1785
02:03:59,348 --> 02:04:03,226
is like the wolf asking the sheep,
or the rapist asking the raped...

1786
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:04,477
Do you hate me?

1787
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:08,314
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

1788
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:10,483
This is a black man asking the question.

1789
02:04:10,693 --> 02:04:14,863
What would you call an educated Negro
with a B.A., an M.A., a B.S. or a Ph.D.?

1790
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:18,533
You call him a nigger.
That's what the white man calls him.

1791
02:04:18,701 --> 02:04:20,910
You have to understand this thinking.

1792
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,747
To understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

1793
02:04:24,957 --> 02:04:28,626
the house Negro and the field Negro.

1794
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:30,628
The house Negro lived in the house...

1795
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:34,507
next to his master, in the big house,
in the basement or the attic.

1796
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:37,469
He dressed good, he ate good,
what the master left him.

1797
02:04:37,678 --> 02:04:39,304
He loved his master.

1798
02:04:39,513 --> 02:04:42,724
He loved his master better
than the master loved himself.

1799
02:04:42,892 --> 02:04:47,228
If master said, we got a nice house,
you say, yeah, boss, we got a nice house.

1800
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,981
Master's house caught on fire,
the house Negro...

1801
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,691
would put the blaze out.

1802
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:55,445
If the master got sick, he'd say,
what's the matter, boss? We sick?

1803
02:04:55,613 --> 02:04:58,281
We sick!
This is the thinking of the house Negro.

1804
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:00,074
If another slave said to him...

1805
02:05:00,242 --> 02:05:03,286
Let's run away, let's separate
from this cruel master...

1806
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:06,414
He said, why? What's better
than what we got here?

1807
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:08,958
I'm not going anywhere.
This is the house Negro.

1808
02:05:09,126 --> 02:05:11,127
In those days,
we called them house niggers.

1809
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:15,381
That's what we call them today because
we still got a lot of house niggers.

1810
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,467
Dear Holy Apostle...

1811
02:05:19,303 --> 02:05:22,597
the ministers think Malcolm
is getting too much press.

1812
02:05:23,891 --> 02:05:26,518
They think he thinks
he is the Nation of Islam.

1813
02:05:28,395 --> 02:05:31,064
That he has aspirations
to lead the Nation.

1814
02:05:32,107 --> 02:05:35,026
It was you who made Malcolm
the man he is.

1815
02:05:35,236 --> 02:05:36,736
You lifted him out of darkness.

1816
02:05:36,904 --> 02:05:38,530
You...

1817
02:05:40,324 --> 02:05:42,951
You go and tell the brothers...

1818
02:05:43,702 --> 02:05:45,453
that what the Brother Minister...

1819
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:47,664
is doing, has done...

1820
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:52,377
has been of great benefit
to the Nation.

1821
02:05:52,586 --> 02:05:54,587
And you tell them that I say so.

1822
02:05:54,797 --> 02:05:57,423
The ministers think he is
of great benefit to himself.

1823
02:06:06,976 --> 02:06:08,059
One at a time.

1824
02:06:08,269 --> 02:06:10,144
Did you say white people are devils?

1825
02:06:10,312 --> 02:06:11,312
I said they're devils.

1826
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:13,314
Should all blacks be armed, sir?

1827
02:06:13,482 --> 02:06:15,858
Well, one of your most
famous men said...

1828
02:06:16,068 --> 02:06:19,612
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.
That's the way you think.

1829
02:06:19,822 --> 02:06:22,156
Do you think your cause
will be successful?

1830
02:06:22,324 --> 02:06:23,658
I sincerely hope so.

1831
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:26,160
- Do you advocate violence?
- No, sir.

1832
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:28,580
Has a white man helped your people?

1833
02:06:28,789 --> 02:06:31,332
Has there been a white man
that's helped my people?

1834
02:06:31,542 --> 02:06:33,751
- Correct.
- I don't understand the question.

1835
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:36,129
You preach anti-white,
anti-Christian science.

1836
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:38,214
You're saying you're anti-white?

1837
02:06:38,424 --> 02:06:41,384
- No, you're saying it.
- Are all white people devils?

1838
02:06:42,011 --> 02:06:45,179
We've gotta move out.
We've got a plane to catch.

1839
02:06:48,058 --> 02:06:50,435
Excuse me, Mr. X?

1840
02:06:51,103 --> 02:06:53,021
I've read some of your speeches...

1841
02:06:53,188 --> 02:06:56,941
and I honestly believe that a lot
of what you have to say is true.

1842
02:06:57,151 --> 02:07:00,194
I'm a good person in spite
of what my ancestors did.

1843
02:07:00,404 --> 02:07:02,488
I just wanted to ask you...

1844
02:07:02,698 --> 02:07:05,533
what can a white person like me,
who isn't prejudiced...

1845
02:07:05,743 --> 02:07:09,329
what can I do to help you
and further your cause?

1846
02:07:09,538 --> 02:07:10,622
Nothing.

1847
02:07:18,172 --> 02:07:20,548
My high school was a black ghetto...

1848
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:22,925
in Roxbury, right here in Boston.

1849
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:27,388
I got my college education on
the streets of Harlem in New York City.

1850
02:07:28,223 --> 02:07:32,727
I took my master's degree in prison,
over the course of 6 1/2 years.

1851
02:07:32,936 --> 02:07:34,187
In fact...

1852
02:07:34,396 --> 02:07:38,066
my old burglary hangout
was just outside this campus.

1853
02:07:38,817 --> 02:07:40,276
I lived like an animal.

1854
02:07:41,236 --> 02:07:42,612
I stole.

1855
02:07:42,946 --> 02:07:44,739
I used drugs.

1856
02:07:45,741 --> 02:07:48,785
I smoked reefers, cocaine.

1857
02:07:48,994 --> 02:07:52,789
I committed adultery. Had it not been
for the honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1858
02:07:53,582 --> 02:07:56,417
I'd have surely been in
an insane asylum or dead...

1859
02:07:56,585 --> 02:07:59,337
or possibly even a murderer
of one of you.

1860
02:07:59,546 --> 02:08:03,758
So, what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side...

1861
02:08:04,009 --> 02:08:07,679
so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

1862
02:08:07,888 --> 02:08:10,723
When the so-called Negro in America
gets on God's side...

1863
02:08:10,891 --> 02:08:13,532
and listens to the teachings
of the honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1864
02:08:13,727 --> 02:08:17,146
he'll want to get off of drugs
and get away from a life of crime.

1865
02:08:17,356 --> 02:08:20,024
He'll want to get away
from committing adultery.

1866
02:08:20,234 --> 02:08:23,111
Then he'd want to get off welfare.
He'd want a job...

1867
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:26,906
to take care of his family.
And his family would respect him.

1868
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:29,575
His son will say,
I'm proud that that's my father.

1869
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:32,495
His wife will say,
I'm proud that that's my husband.

1870
02:08:32,705 --> 02:08:37,333
Father only means that you're taking care
of your children. That's what it is.

1871
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:40,545
Father doesn't mean
that you're having some babies.

1872
02:08:40,754 --> 02:08:44,298
That doesn't make you a father.
Anybody can go out and get a woman.

1873
02:08:44,466 --> 02:08:47,468
But not anybody can take care
of that woman.

1874
02:08:47,636 --> 02:08:50,388
There's another word for it.
It's called responsibility.

1875
02:08:50,973 --> 02:08:55,435
If the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen...

1876
02:08:55,644 --> 02:08:57,645
we wouldn't have a racial problem.

1877
02:08:57,813 --> 02:09:00,974
If the Emancipation Proclamation was
authentic, we wouldn't have a race problem.

1878
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,693
If the 13th,
14th and 15th amendments...

1879
02:09:03,902 --> 02:09:06,654
were authentic,
we wouldn't have a race problem.

1880
02:09:06,864 --> 02:09:09,824
If the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic...

1881
02:09:10,033 --> 02:09:12,118
we wouldn't have a race problem.

1882
02:09:12,286 --> 02:09:15,288
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy.

1883
02:09:15,497 --> 02:09:18,207
These Negro leaders are telling
the white man...

1884
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:21,252
that everything's all right,
we got it under control.

1885
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:24,130
That everything the honorable
Elijah Muhammad teaches is wrong.

1886
02:09:24,339 --> 02:09:27,842
Mr. Muhammad said these things
were gonna come to pass...

1887
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,845
and now this things
are starting to come to pass.

1888
02:09:32,681 --> 02:09:35,391
Now these same Negro leaders...

1889
02:09:36,518 --> 02:09:41,189
are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion.

1890
02:09:43,066 --> 02:09:45,693
Yes, there's gonna be
a racial explosion.

1891
02:09:46,153 --> 02:09:49,864
And a racial explosion is
more dangerous than an atomic explosion.

1892
02:09:52,367 --> 02:09:56,496
There's going to be an explosion because
black people are dissatisfied...

1893
02:09:56,705 --> 02:10:00,875
not only with the white man,
but with these Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

1894
02:10:01,084 --> 02:10:04,629
that are trying to pose as spokesmen
for you and I.

1895
02:10:05,047 --> 02:10:06,255
Just like you have a...

1896
02:10:07,049 --> 02:10:08,800
Just like you have a powder keg.

1897
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:11,761
When you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks...

1898
02:10:11,929 --> 02:10:13,554
the thing's going to explode.

1899
02:10:13,722 --> 02:10:17,517
If the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house...

1900
02:10:17,726 --> 02:10:20,728
and if it explodes, then the house
is going to be destroyed.

1901
02:10:20,896 --> 02:10:23,731
I said the house is going
to be destroyed.

1902
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:26,526
The honorable Elijah Muhammad
is teaching you and I...

1903
02:10:26,735 --> 02:10:30,696
and trying to tell the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house.

1904
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:33,366
Let the black man separate
from his house.

1905
02:10:33,575 --> 02:10:35,576
Let the black man have his own house.

1906
02:10:35,744 --> 02:10:38,538
Let the black man have
his own land and property.

1907
02:10:41,416 --> 02:10:44,418
The honorable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to tell the white man...

1908
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:48,589
that this thing, this explosion,
is gonna bring down his house.

1909
02:10:48,757 --> 02:10:52,260
This is what he's telling him.
More importantly, he's telling him...

1910
02:10:52,427 --> 02:10:54,595
that if he doesn't do
something about it...

1911
02:10:54,763 --> 02:10:58,558
if he doesn't do something about it,
it's gonna explode any day now.

1912
02:10:58,725 --> 02:11:00,142
Yes it is.

1913
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:03,187
I'm just here to tell you,
and I'm gonna make it very short.

1914
02:11:03,730 --> 02:11:07,650
I'm here to tell you about the honorable
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

1915
02:11:07,985 --> 02:11:11,237
His greatest greatness is
that he has the only solution...

1916
02:11:11,446 --> 02:11:13,489
for peace in this country.

1917
02:11:13,949 --> 02:11:16,450
The honorable Elijah Muhammad's
solution...

1918
02:11:16,618 --> 02:11:18,786
is the only solution for you and I.

1919
02:11:18,954 --> 02:11:21,622
It's the only solution for the white man.

1920
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:25,293
Complete separation...

1921
02:11:25,627 --> 02:11:29,088
between the black race
and the white race.

1922
02:11:31,717 --> 02:11:33,593
It's the only solution.

1923
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:42,335
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

1924
02:11:42,477 --> 02:11:44,729
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

1925
02:12:20,557 --> 02:12:22,350
Brother Malcolm!

1926
02:12:23,185 --> 02:12:25,895
Yes, yes. Hold on, hold on.

1927
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:30,024
Yes, sir. It's all right.
My brother. How you doing?

1928
02:12:30,233 --> 02:12:32,318
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

1929
02:12:32,527 --> 02:12:34,320
Are you Elijah's pimp?

1930
02:12:34,529 --> 02:12:38,240
- He should be killed talking like that!
- Hold it. Hold on.

1931
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:40,034
What are you saying, brother?

1932
02:12:40,535 --> 02:12:42,161
His greatest greatness.

1933
02:12:42,371 --> 02:12:44,121
Just say what you're saying.

1934
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:47,625
If you don't know...

1935
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,418
I feel the sorriest for you.

1936
02:12:49,586 --> 02:12:51,587
Oh, come on, brother.

1937
02:12:52,756 --> 02:12:54,756
- Let me tell you something...
- No. Let me tell...

1938
02:13:03,642 --> 02:13:07,645
It's all right.

1939
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:11,565
He's just hungry for knowledge,
that's all.

1940
02:13:11,775 --> 02:13:14,000
Yeah, that brother's starving.

1941
02:13:14,277 --> 02:13:17,230
So am I. Come on,
let's get something to eat.

1942
02:13:18,657 --> 02:13:20,199
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

1943
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:22,910
- Okay, night-night, Daddy.
- Night-night.

1944
02:13:38,468 --> 02:13:39,677
Long night.

1945
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:45,141
Oh, yeah.

1946
02:13:46,893 --> 02:13:48,686
- What you looking at?
- You.

1947
02:13:48,895 --> 02:13:52,773
- Why you looking at me like that?
- Because you're in trouble.

1948
02:13:54,067 --> 02:13:57,319
- How do you know that?
- Oh, dear heart.

1949
02:13:57,946 --> 02:13:59,280
Because I know you.

1950
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:01,157
Well, if you know me...

1951
02:14:02,993 --> 02:14:06,787
you know that I don't like to bring
my troubles into my house.

1952
02:14:07,497 --> 02:14:08,998
You know that also.

1953
02:14:11,835 --> 02:14:14,170
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

1954
02:14:15,464 --> 02:14:17,548
But I'm not made of glass.

1955
02:14:17,758 --> 02:14:19,759
And I won't break.

1956
02:14:27,225 --> 02:14:29,477
Look, Betty, I just want peace.

1957
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:33,272
I want to sit here with you.
I want to...

1958
02:14:34,566 --> 02:14:37,651
be still. I want peace in my house.

1959
02:14:41,323 --> 02:14:44,033
- Have we ever had a fight?
- Never.

1960
02:14:44,242 --> 02:14:46,619
- Argument?
- Never had one, no.

1961
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:51,123
We're gonna have one...

1962
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:55,336
- Right now if you don't talk about it.
- Talk about what?

1963
02:14:55,504 --> 02:14:59,507
- The talk's everywhere.
- There's always gonna be talk.

1964
02:14:59,716 --> 02:15:03,052
Aren't they talking now about me trying
to take over the Nation?

1965
02:15:03,345 --> 02:15:06,388
Aren't they talking about
how we're getting rich...

1966
02:15:06,598 --> 02:15:08,432
off the Nation of Islam?

1967
02:15:08,642 --> 02:15:11,393
- We could talk about that too.
- Let's talk about it.

1968
02:15:11,812 --> 02:15:13,604
It's not just talk anymore.

1969
02:15:13,814 --> 02:15:17,108
Elijah Muhammad...

1970
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:20,194
67-year-old leader
of the Black Muslim movement...

1971
02:15:20,362 --> 02:15:24,698
today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries.

1972
02:15:24,908 --> 02:15:28,327
These are slanders. These are lies.
Don't you realize that?

1973
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:32,581
Don't you realize whose newspaper this is.
This is the devil's newspaper.

1974
02:15:32,916 --> 02:15:35,000
He's trying to divide us.

1975
02:15:35,502 --> 02:15:39,672
Don't you see that? Divide and conquer.
He's trying to bring down our leader.

1976
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:44,426
Both women...

1977
02:15:45,262 --> 02:15:48,889
in their 20s,
charge that they had intimacy...

1978
02:15:49,099 --> 02:15:51,976
Intimacies with Mr. Muhammad.

1979
02:16:00,235 --> 02:16:04,238
You think I'm not
aware of these accusations?

1980
02:16:04,447 --> 02:16:07,783
You think I'm not
aware of these vicious lies?

1981
02:16:09,911 --> 02:16:12,371
Brother Baines and I
discussed it today.

1982
02:16:12,539 --> 02:16:16,000
- Baines? Is he your friend?
- What's the matter with you?

1983
02:16:16,209 --> 02:16:18,669
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

1984
02:16:18,879 --> 02:16:22,423
Wake up! Are you so committed
that you've blinded yourself?

1985
02:16:22,632 --> 02:16:25,426
You're so dedicated,
you can't face the truth?

1986
02:16:25,635 --> 02:16:26,927
Baines?

1987
02:16:27,137 --> 02:16:30,598
He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

1988
02:16:30,807 --> 02:16:35,102
Ask him why your name hasn't appeared
in Muhammad Speaks in over a year.

1989
02:16:35,312 --> 02:16:38,731
- I'm not interested in publicity.
- You're in every other paper.

1990
02:16:38,899 --> 02:16:42,610
- Not one single sentence in your own.
- Our people know what I'm doing.

1991
02:16:42,777 --> 02:16:46,530
- But do you know what Baines is doing?
- What is this Baines? Baines!

1992
02:16:46,698 --> 02:16:49,825
You're so blind!
Everyone can see this but you!

1993
02:16:51,494 --> 02:16:54,955
Baines is the one who saved my life.

1994
02:16:55,123 --> 02:16:57,458
When I crawled in prison
like an animal...

1995
02:16:57,626 --> 02:17:00,294
he brought me to
the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1996
02:17:00,462 --> 02:17:03,088
And the honorable Elijah Muhammad
brought me back from the dead...

1997
02:17:03,298 --> 02:17:05,299
A long time ago! You've repaid them!

1998
02:17:05,508 --> 02:17:08,219
Don't you raise your voice
in my house!

1999
02:17:12,682 --> 02:17:14,183
Ask them.

2000
02:17:15,685 --> 02:17:18,479
Ask them why they have new cars,
houses and furniture.

2001
02:17:18,688 --> 02:17:21,482
Is that what this is about?
You want new furniture?

2002
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:23,776
- You want some cars?
- What do we have?

2003
02:17:23,985 --> 02:17:25,986
What do we have, Malcolm?

2004
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:28,322
Broken-down jalopy...

2005
02:17:29,407 --> 02:17:31,408
The clothes on our backs.

2006
02:17:31,576 --> 02:17:33,417
You want new clothes?
I'll get you new clothes.

2007
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:36,121
We don't even own our own home.

2008
02:17:36,331 --> 02:17:39,250
What about our children?
What about me?

2009
02:17:39,626 --> 02:17:41,627
You don't even own life insurance.

2010
02:17:41,836 --> 02:17:45,172
The Nation will provide for you
if anything happens to me...

2011
02:17:45,382 --> 02:17:46,423
Will they?

2012
02:17:47,550 --> 02:17:54,056
Are you sure?

2013
02:17:55,725 --> 02:17:57,393
Or are you blind?

2014
02:18:00,981 --> 02:18:02,314
All right.

2015
02:18:07,862 --> 02:18:09,738
I've got work to do, so...

2016
02:18:11,408 --> 02:18:13,409
There's always work to do.

2017
02:18:13,702 --> 02:18:15,494
- Help me.
- I'm trying to.

2018
02:18:15,704 --> 02:18:17,663
I'm raising our children
practically by myself.

2019
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:19,206
And what am I doing?

2020
02:18:19,416 --> 02:18:22,042
What do you want me to do?
Stay home?

2021
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:25,713
You don't know how often they ask,
where's Daddy? I want Daddy.

2022
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:28,549
You want me to make the beds
and go on the road?

2023
02:18:28,758 --> 02:18:30,509
- The people need me!
- We need you!

2024
02:18:30,719 --> 02:18:33,387
I need you too.
But what do you want me to do?

2025
02:18:33,596 --> 02:18:35,723
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

2026
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:40,894
You can face death 24 hours a day,
but the possibility of betrayal...

2027
02:18:41,146 --> 02:18:43,272
never enters your head.

2028
02:18:46,568 --> 02:18:48,444
Open your eyes.

2029
02:19:25,023 --> 02:19:27,941
- As-Salaam-Alaikum, minister.
- Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

2030
02:19:28,109 --> 02:19:30,110
Her name's Eva Marie.

2031
02:19:31,112 --> 02:19:32,696
And she's 2 years old.

2032
02:19:34,282 --> 02:19:37,034
Brother Minister,
I didn't do anything wrong.

2033
02:19:37,285 --> 02:19:40,371
I didn't do anything to be
put in isolation.

2034
02:19:41,539 --> 02:19:43,374
I believed in him.

2035
02:19:44,793 --> 02:19:48,212
I believed in
the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2036
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:51,465
Believe in Allah.

2037
02:19:56,054 --> 02:19:58,305
This is Saudi. She's 2.

2038
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,599
And you have Lisha. She's 3.

2039
02:20:00,809 --> 02:20:05,521
From their own mouths,
I heard who had fathered their children.

2040
02:20:06,064 --> 02:20:08,982
And from their own mouths I heard
that the honorable Elijah Muhammad...

2041
02:20:09,150 --> 02:20:11,944
- had told them I was his best.
- He often spoke of you.

2042
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:14,655
He loves you like you were his own son.

2043
02:20:14,906 --> 02:20:18,033
The greatest minister he had,
but that I would leave him...

2044
02:20:18,243 --> 02:20:21,495
turn against him,
and so I was dangerous.

2045
02:20:21,704 --> 02:20:24,373
The honorable Elijah Muhammad,
while praising me to my face...

2046
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:26,041
And he said that about me?

2047
02:20:26,209 --> 02:20:28,502
Was tearing me apart behind my back.

2048
02:20:28,753 --> 02:20:31,046
- You're sure about all this?
- Yes, I am.

2049
02:20:31,297 --> 02:20:34,007
All I want is support for
my three children...

2050
02:20:34,426 --> 02:20:37,511
that the honorable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them.

2051
02:20:37,846 --> 02:20:39,555
That's all I want.

2052
02:20:42,016 --> 02:20:44,059
Allah will provide...

2053
02:20:47,689 --> 02:20:48,730
for all of us.

2054
02:20:49,065 --> 02:20:54,111
What are you talking about, blackout?
Perhaps some brothers are a little jealous.

2055
02:20:54,279 --> 02:20:57,489
Maybe they think you've been
getting too much press.

2056
02:20:57,699 --> 02:20:59,324
It's nothing. Forget it.

2057
02:20:59,534 --> 02:21:02,077
Now, about our coming up
in the world a little.

2058
02:21:02,287 --> 02:21:05,289
The Nation's grown.
We've grown with it.

2059
02:21:06,249 --> 02:21:07,791
You know our people.

2060
02:21:09,294 --> 02:21:11,587
They want their leaders
to be prosperous.

2061
02:21:12,714 --> 02:21:14,506
One hand washes the other.

2062
02:21:15,091 --> 02:21:18,302
I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

2063
02:21:20,763 --> 02:21:22,848
Remember what you told me in prison?

2064
02:21:23,057 --> 02:21:26,894
I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

2065
02:21:28,813 --> 02:21:30,063
Brother Malcolm...

2066
02:21:33,067 --> 02:21:35,444
What do you want? A new car?

2067
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:37,488
A new house?

2068
02:21:39,032 --> 02:21:40,657
It's the money, isn't it?

2069
02:21:45,747 --> 02:21:49,625
But we tell the whole world that
we're moral leaders...

2070
02:21:49,959 --> 02:21:51,752
because we follow...

2071
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:55,005
the personal example of
the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2072
02:21:55,215 --> 02:21:57,341
Elijah Muhammad is a human being...

2073
02:21:58,259 --> 02:21:59,510
and so are you.

2074
02:22:00,428 --> 02:22:02,429
- Do you know your Bible?
- Do you?

2075
02:22:02,597 --> 02:22:04,515
David slept with Bathsheba...

2076
02:22:04,724 --> 02:22:07,100
but he's remembered
for slaying Goliath.

2077
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:12,773
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

2078
02:22:14,067 --> 02:22:18,737
Solomon had 700 wives, but he
was history's greatest, wisest king.

2079
02:22:18,947 --> 02:22:22,658
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

2080
02:22:22,867 --> 02:22:25,786
A great man's deeds
outweigh his personal weaknesses.

2081
02:22:25,995 --> 02:22:28,330
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

2082
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:31,083
- I'm not gonna allow...
- Be careful, Malcolm.

2083
02:22:33,044 --> 02:22:34,461
I warn you.

2084
02:22:35,463 --> 02:22:36,672
You be careful.

2085
02:23:06,035 --> 02:23:08,120
I'm not surprised.

2086
02:23:11,291 --> 02:23:16,169
You have a very good understanding
of prophecy, of spiritual matters.

2087
02:23:16,379 --> 02:23:18,463
I'm not surprised.

2088
02:23:19,048 --> 02:23:21,758
I have built this Nation...

2089
02:23:21,968 --> 02:23:25,262
under the divine guidance of Allah.

2090
02:23:26,055 --> 02:23:30,017
He has brought me back
from the dead to lead my people.

2091
02:23:30,184 --> 02:23:32,603
After me, there will be no more.

2092
02:23:32,812 --> 02:23:34,563
No more.

2093
02:23:38,568 --> 02:23:40,402
I must...

2094
02:23:42,405 --> 02:23:45,699
plant my seed in fertile soil.

2095
02:23:45,908 --> 02:23:47,367
It is only...

2096
02:23:48,036 --> 02:23:51,038
the fulfillment of prophecy.

2097
02:23:51,414 --> 02:23:55,250
My faith had been shattered
in a way I can never fully describe.

2098
02:23:55,501 --> 02:23:58,253
Every second of my 12 years
with Mr. Muhammad...

2099
02:23:58,463 --> 02:24:00,964
I'd been ready
to lay down my life for him.

2100
02:24:01,174 --> 02:24:04,801
The thing to me that is worse than
death itself is betrayal.

2101
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:08,889
I could conceive death,
but I couldn't conceive betrayal.

2102
02:24:09,098 --> 02:24:13,518
Not of the loyalty I gave to
the Nation of Islam and Mr. Muhammad.

2103
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:17,064
During the previous 12 years, if
Mr. Muhammad had committed any crime...

2104
02:24:17,273 --> 02:24:21,151
punishable by death,
I would have tried to prove I did it...

2105
02:24:21,361 --> 02:24:22,653
to save him.

2106
02:24:22,862 --> 02:24:26,239
I would have gladly gone
to the electric chair in his place.

2107
02:24:42,632 --> 02:24:44,466
What did he say?

2108
02:24:51,516 --> 02:24:54,810
- I'm so sorry.
- There's nothing to be sorry about.

2109
02:24:55,478 --> 02:24:58,146
I just got a lot of work to do,
that's all.

2110
02:25:02,276 --> 02:25:03,610
How can you work?

2111
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:06,071
Because we have to teach.

2112
02:25:06,572 --> 02:25:10,242
We gotta teach the people.
We gotta teach on Solomon, Moses...

2113
02:25:10,576 --> 02:25:13,495
David.
Solomon had 700 wives.

2114
02:25:13,705 --> 02:25:17,124
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his...

2115
02:25:18,501 --> 02:25:20,502
My father used to say that...

2116
02:25:21,254 --> 02:25:23,964
you can't make a rooster stop
crowing after sunrise.

2117
02:25:24,173 --> 02:25:25,841
Well, the sun is up.

2118
02:25:48,614 --> 02:25:53,577
So, what do I say about this
so-called national day of mourning?

2119
02:25:53,953 --> 02:25:57,456
I say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned...

2120
02:25:57,665 --> 02:25:59,583
by our beliefs and by his own.

2121
02:25:59,792 --> 02:26:02,586
The Koran teaches us that
those who work evil...

2122
02:26:03,045 --> 02:26:07,507
will be condemned, punished
or judged according to their works.

2123
02:26:07,717 --> 02:26:10,927
The Holy Bible teaches us
that you reap what you sow.

2124
02:26:11,137 --> 02:26:12,596
This is divine justice.

2125
02:26:12,805 --> 02:26:16,641
In the Americas' soil, the white man
has planted seeds of hatred...

2126
02:26:16,851 --> 02:26:18,727
the seeds of violence.

2127
02:26:18,936 --> 02:26:21,521
He's allowed those weeds
to grow up and choke...

2128
02:26:21,731 --> 02:26:25,317
the lives of millions of black men
and women for 400 years...

2129
02:26:25,526 --> 02:26:28,820
and the lives of Indians in these
Americas for 500 years.

2130
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:34,242
And now those same weeds have choked one
of his own gardeners, his chief gardener.

2131
02:26:34,452 --> 02:26:37,704
You ask me what I say.
I only say what the Bible says.

2132
02:26:37,955 --> 02:26:40,207
I say what the Koran says.

2133
02:26:40,958 --> 02:26:42,667
I say it's justice.

2134
02:26:47,548 --> 02:26:50,091
Don't you even feel a bit of remorse...

2135
02:26:50,259 --> 02:26:52,803
saddened by President Kennedy's
assassination?

2136
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:56,264
I don't think anyone would deny that
when you send chickens...

2137
02:26:56,474 --> 02:26:58,266
out from your barnyard...

2138
02:26:58,476 --> 02:27:02,020
those chickens will return to
your barnyard, not your neighbor's.

2139
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:05,565
It's an example of the devil's chickens
coming home to roost.

2140
02:27:05,733 --> 02:27:08,777
The violence that he's
perpetrated here and abroad...

2141
02:27:08,986 --> 02:27:12,906
be it four children in Birmingham,
or Medgar Evers, or in Africa...

2142
02:27:13,115 --> 02:27:15,617
this same violence has claimed
one of their own.

2143
02:27:15,827 --> 02:27:19,746
Being a farm boy, chickens coming home
to roost never made me sad.

2144
02:27:19,914 --> 02:27:21,540
In fact, it's only made me glad.

2145
02:27:31,217 --> 02:27:32,509
Did you...

2146
02:27:33,511 --> 02:27:36,012
read the paper today?

2147
02:27:38,766 --> 02:27:40,433
Yes, sir. I did.

2148
02:27:43,729 --> 02:27:48,650
That was a bad statement you made.

2149
02:27:50,778 --> 02:27:54,447
You knew from my instructions...

2150
02:27:54,699 --> 02:27:59,619
no minister was to make
any statements against this man.

2151
02:27:59,829 --> 02:28:02,372
The country loved this man.

2152
02:28:02,707 --> 02:28:04,541
You have made it...

2153
02:28:04,959 --> 02:28:06,126
hard...

2154
02:28:06,961 --> 02:28:08,628
for Muslims...

2155
02:28:09,005 --> 02:28:10,881
in general.

2156
02:28:13,426 --> 02:28:14,509
Yes, sir.

2157
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:19,514
We must disassociate ourselves...

2158
02:28:19,724 --> 02:28:22,017
from your terrible blunder.

2159
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:26,563
I must silence you.

2160
02:28:27,148 --> 02:28:29,065
For 90 days...

2161
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:36,323
you must not make any statements
to the press...

2162
02:28:37,074 --> 02:28:41,411
nor are you to speak at any temples.

2163
02:28:42,747 --> 02:28:43,914
Yes, sir.

2164
02:28:45,499 --> 02:28:48,418
Yes, sir. I submit 100 percent.

2165
02:29:46,894 --> 02:29:47,978
Leave us alone.

2166
02:29:49,063 --> 02:29:51,272
- Betty?
- Leave us alone. Stop calling here.

2167
02:29:51,482 --> 02:29:54,901
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

2168
02:29:55,236 --> 02:29:56,653
Stop it!

2169
02:29:58,322 --> 02:29:59,739
Hello.

2170
02:30:09,417 --> 02:30:10,750
It's all right.

2171
02:30:11,252 --> 02:30:12,919
They keep calling.

2172
02:30:14,088 --> 02:30:15,422
They keep calling.

2173
02:30:18,509 --> 02:30:19,801
Just...

2174
02:30:21,512 --> 02:30:23,596
take the babies
and put them to bed.

2175
02:30:24,265 --> 02:30:26,599
Come on, babies.
Let's go to bed now.

2176
02:30:27,101 --> 02:30:28,768
- Bedtime.
- Come on.

2177
02:30:29,437 --> 02:30:30,770
Let's go.

2178
02:30:32,106 --> 02:30:35,692
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, Daddy.

2179
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:38,236
- Good night, Sidney.
- Night-night.

2180
02:30:50,958 --> 02:30:53,626
Brother Minister,
I have to level with you.

2181
02:30:54,462 --> 02:30:56,463
They gave me a mission...

2182
02:30:56,881 --> 02:30:58,298
but I couldn't do it.

2183
02:30:59,341 --> 02:31:01,926
- I love you all.
- What kind of mission?

2184
02:31:04,722 --> 02:31:06,681
To wire your car...

2185
02:31:06,891 --> 02:31:09,225
so it would explode...

2186
02:31:09,643 --> 02:31:11,936
when you turned the ignition.

2187
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:17,233
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

2188
02:31:17,651 --> 02:31:20,528
They say that
you're the greatest hypocrite...

2189
02:31:20,738 --> 02:31:22,238
a Judas...

2190
02:31:22,656 --> 02:31:24,574
a Benedict Arnold.

2191
02:31:25,993 --> 02:31:29,579
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out...

2192
02:31:30,081 --> 02:31:33,333
and delivered
to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

2193
02:31:34,043 --> 02:31:35,794
And what do you say?

2194
02:31:36,003 --> 02:31:37,712
I'm with you, Brother Minister.

2195
02:31:37,922 --> 02:31:39,380
You'll be marked for death.

2196
02:31:40,007 --> 02:31:41,174
Yes, sir.

2197
02:31:42,259 --> 02:31:44,219
Let me die then.

2198
02:31:56,774 --> 02:31:58,983
I can't come between you
and your father.

2199
02:31:59,443 --> 02:32:01,694
- You're my father.
- Go on home.

2200
02:32:03,781 --> 02:32:05,949
Don't come back.
That's an order.

2201
02:32:13,541 --> 02:32:15,166
Yes, sir.

2202
02:32:27,638 --> 02:32:31,474
Because 1964 threatens to be an
explosive year on the racial front...

2203
02:32:31,684 --> 02:32:36,312
I have called this press conference
to clarify my position in that struggle.

2204
02:32:36,605 --> 02:32:40,567
Internal differences within the Nation
of Islam have forced me out of it.

2205
02:32:40,734 --> 02:32:44,779
In the past, I thought and spoke the words
of the honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2206
02:32:44,989 --> 02:32:46,906
Everything I said, I started with

2207
02:32:47,074 --> 02:32:50,410
the honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us thus-and-so.

2208
02:32:50,661 --> 02:32:52,287
That day is over.

2209
02:32:52,496 --> 02:32:56,207
From now on I speak my own words,
and I think my own thoughts.

2210
02:32:56,417 --> 02:32:59,127
Now that I have more
independence of action...

2211
02:32:59,336 --> 02:33:02,755
I'll use a more flexible approach
in working with others...

2212
02:33:02,923 --> 02:33:04,591
to solve this problem.

2213
02:33:04,758 --> 02:33:07,093
I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders.

2214
02:33:07,261 --> 02:33:10,763
I've forgotten every bad thing
other leaders said about me...

2215
02:33:10,931 --> 02:33:14,767
and I pray they'll forget the many
bad things I said about them.

2216
02:33:14,935 --> 02:33:19,022
We must work together to find a common
solution to a common problem.

2217
02:33:19,565 --> 02:33:22,442
I will organize and lead
a new mosque in New York City.

2218
02:33:22,651 --> 02:33:24,360
Muslim Mosque, Incorporated.

2219
02:33:24,778 --> 02:33:28,281
This gives us the religious base
and the spiritual force...

2220
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:31,117
necessary to rid our people
of the vices...

2221
02:33:31,368 --> 02:33:33,703
that destroy the moral fiber
of our community.

2222
02:33:33,913 --> 02:33:36,289
Our politics
will be Black Nationalism...

2223
02:33:36,457 --> 02:33:39,542
meaning, we want to control
our community's politics.

2224
02:33:39,752 --> 02:33:42,170
The Muslim Mosque, Inc.
will remain open...

2225
02:33:42,379 --> 02:33:45,632
for ideas and financial aid
from all quarters.

2226
02:33:46,217 --> 02:33:49,135
Whites can help us,
but they can't join us.

2227
02:33:49,386 --> 02:33:52,847
There can't be black-white unity
until there's first black unity.

2228
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:54,766
We can't unite with others...

2229
02:33:54,975 --> 02:33:57,852
until we've first learned
to unite amongst ourselves.

2230
02:33:58,062 --> 02:34:00,188
We can't be acceptable to others...

2231
02:34:00,397 --> 02:34:03,149
until we have first
proven acceptable to ourselves.

2232
02:34:03,317 --> 02:34:06,819
In my desire to fully understand
the religion of Islam...

2233
02:34:07,029 --> 02:34:11,157
as practiced by 750 million
Muslims around the world...

2234
02:34:11,325 --> 02:34:15,745
I intend to make a pilgrimage,
or holy journey, to Mecca.

2235
02:34:15,955 --> 02:34:18,706
This pilgrimage is
a religious requirement...

2236
02:34:18,916 --> 02:34:21,501
or duty,
of every Muslim that is able...

2237
02:34:21,669 --> 02:34:25,463
to make the pilgrimage
at least once in his lifetime.

2238
02:34:39,395 --> 02:34:41,020
I'm Egyptian. And you?

2239
02:34:41,313 --> 02:34:42,397
American.

2240
02:34:42,606 --> 02:34:43,690
What's your name?

2241
02:34:43,857 --> 02:34:46,192
- Malcolm.
- Malcolm.

2242
02:34:56,662 --> 02:34:58,955
Yes, I want to get...

2243
02:35:00,499 --> 02:35:02,625
- How much?
- Twenty Egyptian pounds.

2244
02:35:03,377 --> 02:35:04,627
For one?

2245
02:35:04,837 --> 02:35:07,213
- Special price for you.
- Special for me!

2246
02:35:07,381 --> 02:35:10,800
Okay, thank you.
Where can I get a better price?

2247
02:35:16,265 --> 02:35:18,182
- What's your name?
- Mohammed.

2248
02:35:18,392 --> 02:35:19,934
Mohammed, I'm Malcolm.

2249
02:35:21,061 --> 02:35:23,563
- Malcolm X. And you?
- Gamaal.

2250
02:35:23,814 --> 02:35:27,817
All right, Gamaal. I'm from Harlem.
From the United States.

2251
02:35:27,985 --> 02:35:29,027
Harem?

2252
02:35:29,194 --> 02:35:30,236
- Harlem.
- Hareem?

2253
02:35:30,404 --> 02:35:32,572
No, not Hareem. Harlem.

2254
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:34,615
Can you show me around?

2255
02:35:34,825 --> 02:35:36,617
- Hash?
- No. No hashish.

2256
02:35:39,330 --> 02:35:41,581
- You know, the pyramids.
- Yeah!

2257
02:35:41,749 --> 02:35:43,499
No, pyramids. Pyramids. Pyramids.

2258
02:35:48,213 --> 02:35:49,922
- Pyramids?
- Pyramids.

2259
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:52,383
- You're gonna take me?
- Yes. Yes.

2260
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:54,969
Sphinx. Sphinx.

2261
02:37:16,427 --> 02:37:18,177
My darling Betty.

2262
02:37:18,679 --> 02:37:22,682
Everywhere I go, I am welcomed
as a representative of our people.

2263
02:37:23,016 --> 02:37:26,185
Our struggle is known
and respected worldwide.

2264
02:37:26,687 --> 02:37:30,481
Coincidentally, two white men
follow me around wherever I go.

2265
02:37:30,858 --> 02:37:32,775
I wonder who they're working for?

2266
02:37:33,277 --> 02:37:35,736
If I was a betting man,
I'd say the CIA.

2267
02:37:35,946 --> 02:37:37,113
What's your guess?

2268
02:37:38,115 --> 02:37:40,158
Today I arrived in Arabia.

2269
02:37:40,784 --> 02:37:44,704
I have never witnessed
such sincere hospitality...

2270
02:37:44,872 --> 02:37:46,998
and true brotherhood...

2271
02:37:47,207 --> 02:37:48,833
as practiced here...

2272
02:37:49,042 --> 02:37:52,295
in the ancient home
of Abraham, Mohammed...

2273
02:37:52,838 --> 02:37:56,048
and the great prophets
of the scriptures.

2274
02:38:02,306 --> 02:38:04,891
Today, with thousands of others...

2275
02:38:05,058 --> 02:38:08,644
I proclaimed God's greatness
in the sacred city of Mecca.

2276
02:38:09,730 --> 02:38:13,149
In the ihram garb, I made
my seven circuits around the Kaaba.

2277
02:38:13,734 --> 02:38:16,068
I drank from the well of Zem Zem.

2278
02:38:16,487 --> 02:38:19,238
I prayed to Allah from Mount Arafat.

2279
02:38:19,573 --> 02:38:23,451
It was the only time in my life that
I stood before the creator of all...

2280
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:26,162
and felt like a complete human being.

2281
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:48,935
Now, you may be shocked
by these words...

2282
02:38:49,102 --> 02:38:52,980
but I've eaten from the same plate,
drunk from the same glass...

2283
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:57,193
and prayed to the same God
with Muslims whose eyes were blue...

2284
02:38:57,402 --> 02:39:01,656
whose hair was blond, and whose
skin was the whitest of white.

2285
02:39:01,865 --> 02:39:03,616
And we were all brothers...

2286
02:39:03,784 --> 02:39:04,825
truly.

2287
02:39:05,035 --> 02:39:09,622
People of all colors and races
believing in one God, in one humanity.

2288
02:39:24,304 --> 02:39:26,514
Each hour in this sacred land gives me...

2289
02:39:26,723 --> 02:39:30,309
greater spiritual insight into
what is happening in America.

2290
02:39:30,727 --> 02:39:35,022
The American Negro can never
be blamed for his racial animosities.

2291
02:39:35,232 --> 02:39:39,193
He's only reacting to 400 years of
oppression and discrimination.

2292
02:39:39,403 --> 02:39:42,863
But as racism leads America
up the suicidal path...

2293
02:39:43,073 --> 02:39:46,701
I believe the younger generation
will see the writing on the wall...

2294
02:39:46,910 --> 02:39:50,329
and many will want to turn to
the spiritual path of truth...

2295
02:39:50,497 --> 02:39:53,249
the only way left to ward off
the disaster...

2296
02:39:53,458 --> 02:39:55,418
that racism must surely lead to.

2297
02:39:56,336 --> 02:40:00,506
Once before, in prison,
the truth came and blinded me.

2298
02:40:01,592 --> 02:40:03,301
Well, it has happened again.

2299
02:40:04,344 --> 02:40:07,847
In the past, I've made sweeping
indictments of all white people.

2300
02:40:08,098 --> 02:40:10,725
And these generalizations
have caused injuries...

2301
02:40:10,934 --> 02:40:13,436
to some white folks
who didn't deserve them.

2302
02:40:14,521 --> 02:40:18,524
Because of the spiritual rebirth
which I was blessed to undergo...

2303
02:40:18,734 --> 02:40:20,901
as a result of my pilgrimage...

2304
02:40:21,111 --> 02:40:23,195
to the holy city of Mecca...

2305
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:28,743
I no longer subscribe
to sweeping indictments of one race.

2306
02:40:29,036 --> 02:40:30,453
I intend...

2307
02:40:31,371 --> 02:40:33,581
to be very careful not to...

2308
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:37,585
careful not to sentence anyone
who has not been proven guilty.

2309
02:40:38,211 --> 02:40:40,254
I am not a racist...

2310
02:40:40,464 --> 02:40:43,758
and I do not subscribe to any
of the tenets of racism.

2311
02:40:43,967 --> 02:40:45,885
In all honesty and sincerity...

2312
02:40:46,053 --> 02:40:50,181
it can be stated that I wish
nothing but freedom, justice...

2313
02:40:50,390 --> 02:40:52,058
and equality...

2314
02:40:52,684 --> 02:40:57,396
life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness for all people.

2315
02:40:57,814 --> 02:41:01,067
My first concern is with the group
to which I belong...

2316
02:41:01,234 --> 02:41:05,404
for we, more than others,
are deprived of our inalienable rights.

2317
02:41:05,572 --> 02:41:07,573
But the true practice of Islam...

2318
02:41:07,783 --> 02:41:09,784
can remove the cancer of racism...

2319
02:41:09,993 --> 02:41:13,621
from the hearts and the souls
of all Americans.

2320
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:16,123
If I can die having brought any light...

2321
02:41:16,333 --> 02:41:21,253
having exposed any truth that
will help destroy this disease...

2322
02:41:22,005 --> 02:41:25,925
then all the credit is due to Allah,
the Lord of all the worlds.

2323
02:41:26,426 --> 02:41:28,844
And only the mistakes have been mine.

2324
02:41:30,430 --> 02:41:32,765
Please give all my love to the children.

2325
02:41:33,266 --> 02:41:34,850
I love you dearly.

2326
02:41:35,769 --> 02:41:39,021
Sincerely,
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz...

2327
02:41:39,356 --> 02:41:41,023
Malcolm X.

2328
02:42:28,822 --> 02:42:29,905
Let's begin.

2329
02:42:30,115 --> 02:42:34,493
Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad
you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.

2330
02:42:34,661 --> 02:42:38,914
Yes, when I was in Mecca
making the pilgrimage...

2331
02:42:39,833 --> 02:42:44,044
the brotherhood that existed there
among all people, all races...

2332
02:42:44,254 --> 02:42:48,299
all levels of people who
had accepted the religion of Islam...

2333
02:42:49,259 --> 02:42:53,846
what it had done
for those people, despite...

2334
02:42:54,055 --> 02:42:56,015
their complexion differences...

2335
02:42:56,224 --> 02:42:59,477
Perhaps if people
here in America would try...

2336
02:42:59,686 --> 02:43:03,272
and practice and study the religion
of Islam, it might help...

2337
02:43:03,482 --> 02:43:07,318
to erase the plague of racism here.

2338
02:43:07,778 --> 02:43:11,030
I think Muslims over there
look at themselves as...

2339
02:43:11,198 --> 02:43:16,160
human beings, as part of
the same human family.

2340
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:19,038
Today my friends are black...

2341
02:43:19,331 --> 02:43:21,707
red, yellow, brown and white.

2342
02:43:21,917 --> 02:43:26,837
Are you prepared to ask the U.N.
to bring charges against the U.S...

2343
02:43:27,047 --> 02:43:28,672
for its treatment of Negroes?

2344
02:43:28,882 --> 02:43:30,841
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

2345
02:43:32,719 --> 02:43:35,221
The audience will have to be quiet.

2346
02:43:36,014 --> 02:43:37,723
Please, please.

2347
02:43:38,642 --> 02:43:41,310
Yes, as I stated earlier that...

2348
02:43:42,312 --> 02:43:45,397
those nations,
African, Latin, Asian nations...

2349
02:43:45,607 --> 02:43:48,609
are hypocritical
when they stand up in the U.N.

2350
02:43:48,819 --> 02:43:52,238
and denounce the racism practiced
in South Africa...

2351
02:43:52,405 --> 02:43:55,074
but say absolutely nothing about...

2352
02:43:55,325 --> 02:43:58,452
the practice of racism here
in American society.

2353
02:43:58,662 --> 02:44:01,330
Now, I wouldn't be a man
if I didn't do so.

2354
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:06,460
Will you work now with leaders
of other civil rights organizations?

2355
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:10,756
Yes, we're prepared to work with
any groups, leaders, organizations...

2356
02:44:10,924 --> 02:44:14,426
as long as they're
genuinely interested in results.

2357
02:44:14,594 --> 02:44:15,636
Positive results.

2358
02:44:15,846 --> 02:44:18,597
Does your new beard have any
religious significance?

2359
02:44:20,058 --> 02:44:21,934
No, not particularly, but...

2360
02:44:22,269 --> 02:44:25,771
I think that as black people
in America strive...

2361
02:44:25,981 --> 02:44:29,567
to throw off the shackles
of mental colonialism...

2362
02:44:29,776 --> 02:44:31,777
they'll also reflect their desire...

2363
02:44:31,987 --> 02:44:34,989
to throw off the shackles of
cultural colonialism.

2364
02:44:35,198 --> 02:44:38,993
I believe that a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

2365
02:44:39,202 --> 02:44:41,245
not necessarily a physical one...

2366
02:44:41,454 --> 02:44:45,040
but a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

2367
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:49,378
which means we reaffirm our bond
with our brothers over there...

2368
02:44:49,671 --> 02:44:53,841
would help to strengthen us here,
black people in America.

2369
02:44:54,050 --> 02:44:57,344
Not only spiritually,
but it would give us the incentive...

2370
02:44:57,554 --> 02:45:00,764
to solve some of our problems here,
at home.

2371
02:45:00,974 --> 02:45:03,559
One of your
more controversial remarks...

2372
02:45:03,768 --> 02:45:06,896
called for black people to get
rifles and form clubs.

2373
02:45:07,105 --> 02:45:08,814
Do you still favor that for self-defense?

2374
02:45:08,982 --> 02:45:10,983
I don't see why that's controversial.

2375
02:45:11,192 --> 02:45:14,111
If white people find themselves
the victims...

2376
02:45:14,321 --> 02:45:18,824
of the violence black people found
themselves victims of in America...

2377
02:45:19,034 --> 02:45:22,786
and if the government was unable
or unwilling to do anything...

2378
02:45:22,996 --> 02:45:26,123
it'd be intelligence on their part
to defend themselves.

2379
02:45:26,333 --> 02:45:27,833
What about the guns?

2380
02:45:29,711 --> 02:45:33,505
When you tell your people to stop
being violent against my people...

2381
02:45:33,715 --> 02:45:37,509
- I'll tell my people to put away their guns.
- So you're still an extremist.

2382
02:45:37,844 --> 02:45:39,762
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2383
02:45:43,725 --> 02:45:45,184
Damn.

2384
02:45:46,394 --> 02:45:47,436
Next question.

2385
02:46:07,791 --> 02:46:11,502
Malcolm, you one dead, red nigger.

2386
02:46:12,045 --> 02:46:16,006
Your days on this earth
are numbered, brother.

2387
02:46:28,395 --> 02:46:29,520
Come to bed.

2388
02:46:30,105 --> 02:46:31,897
Get some rest.

2389
02:46:37,404 --> 02:46:38,904
I'm sorry, Betty.

2390
02:46:40,448 --> 02:46:41,532
Sorry for what?

2391
02:46:41,741 --> 02:46:45,411
I haven't been the best husband
or the best father.

2392
02:46:45,578 --> 02:46:48,205
A family shouldn't be separated
like ours has been.

2393
02:46:48,415 --> 02:46:52,084
I promise I'll never make a long trip
without you and the children.

2394
02:46:55,755 --> 02:46:57,297
I miss you and the girls.

2395
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:05,431
We will be together,
I promise you that.

2396
02:47:06,766 --> 02:47:07,808
Dear heart...

2397
02:47:10,145 --> 02:47:11,645
I love you.

2398
02:47:16,359 --> 02:47:17,943
Thank you.

2399
02:47:25,452 --> 02:47:27,286
Now get some sleep.

2400
02:47:32,167 --> 02:47:35,461
We had the best organization
the black man has ever seen.

2401
02:47:36,838 --> 02:47:38,130
Niggers ruined it.

2402
02:48:05,408 --> 02:48:06,658
Betty.

2403
02:48:09,370 --> 02:48:10,662
Betty, wake up.

2404
02:48:14,834 --> 02:48:16,210
Come on! Let's get up!

2405
02:48:16,419 --> 02:48:18,796
Girls, come on! Come on!
Out! Out!

2406
02:48:19,172 --> 02:48:20,672
Outside! Out! Out! Out!

2407
02:48:22,842 --> 02:48:25,177
Go, go! Run, run!

2408
02:48:25,386 --> 02:48:27,638
Go across the street!

2409
02:48:27,847 --> 02:48:30,766
- Somebody call the fire department!
- Help! Help!

2410
02:48:32,143 --> 02:48:34,186
Call the fire department, please!

2411
02:48:34,354 --> 02:48:36,396
Somebody call the fire department!

2412
02:48:36,606 --> 02:48:37,856
I'm a man!

2413
02:48:38,066 --> 02:48:40,025
Evidently, the...

2414
02:48:40,735 --> 02:48:44,404
some type of Molotov bomb was thrown
against the back of the house.

2415
02:48:44,572 --> 02:48:48,075
One was thrown on the side
of the house, from what I can tell.

2416
02:48:51,037 --> 02:48:53,997
It bounced up against the window
and woke my daughter.

2417
02:48:54,207 --> 02:48:57,167
Had it gone inside,
my 2-year-old, my 4-year-old...

2418
02:48:57,377 --> 02:48:59,586
and my 6-year-old daughter
would have...

2419
02:48:59,754 --> 02:49:02,172
Had that happened,
I'd have taken my rifle...

2420
02:49:02,382 --> 02:49:04,007
and gone after anyone in sight.

2421
02:49:04,217 --> 02:49:07,010
Was this a warning
or an attempt on your life?

2422
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:09,596
What, does it look like
a warning to you?

2423
02:49:09,806 --> 02:49:11,557
This was a definite attempt...

2424
02:49:11,891 --> 02:49:15,519
by the Nation of Islam, upon
the strict orders of Mr. Elijah Muhammad.

2425
02:49:15,728 --> 02:49:18,814
- Muslim headquarters say...
- I don't care what they say.

2426
02:49:19,023 --> 02:49:20,399
I see what they're doing.

2427
02:49:20,567 --> 02:49:24,236
Minister Baines, can you tell us
who bombed the house?

2428
02:49:24,529 --> 02:49:28,407
We feel it's a publicity stunt
on the part of Malcolm X.

2429
02:49:28,616 --> 02:49:31,243
We hope it isn't a case of, well...

2430
02:49:31,411 --> 02:49:33,537
if he can't keep the house,
we won't get it either.

2431
02:49:33,746 --> 02:49:35,247
That's enough. Excuse me.

2432
02:49:39,460 --> 02:49:41,086
Malcolm!

2433
02:49:41,754 --> 02:49:43,088
I'm all right. I'm all right.

2434
02:49:43,256 --> 02:49:45,048
- Betty and the kids?
- They're fine.

2435
02:49:45,258 --> 02:49:47,426
Let's post some
men in front of the house.

2436
02:49:47,635 --> 02:49:50,554
- Did you see anybody?
- No, but I know who it is.

2437
02:49:50,763 --> 02:49:53,098
- You know I know who did it.
- Give us the command.

2438
02:49:53,308 --> 02:49:56,101
Don't worry about the command.
Two men on post, two in front!

2439
02:49:56,269 --> 02:49:58,510
We got an informant among us,
whether you like it or not.

2440
02:49:58,646 --> 02:50:01,773
Now, we gotta weed this so-called
brother out before things get too crazy.

2441
02:50:31,471 --> 02:50:32,596
Spark it.

2442
02:50:42,690 --> 02:50:44,691
As-Salaam-Alaikum, my brothers.

2443
02:50:46,653 --> 02:50:50,197
- Here's your key. Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

2444
02:50:53,993 --> 02:50:55,661
O.A.A.U.

2445
02:50:56,996 --> 02:50:59,081
Brother Earl, it's Malcolm.

2446
02:51:01,626 --> 02:51:04,336
- Earl.
- Malcolm. Where are you?

2447
02:51:04,504 --> 02:51:05,963
We've been calling
all over the city.

2448
02:51:06,214 --> 02:51:07,547
Hold on.

2449
02:51:16,099 --> 02:51:18,016
I'm downtown.

2450
02:51:18,351 --> 02:51:21,645
I'm in a hotel trying
to get some work done for tomorrow.

2451
02:51:21,854 --> 02:51:24,690
- Let me bring some brothers there.
- That's all right.

2452
02:51:24,983 --> 02:51:27,067
I wish you'd listen to us.

2453
02:51:27,277 --> 02:51:30,487
We must frisk people
at the Audubon Ballroom meeting.

2454
02:51:30,697 --> 02:51:33,198
No, no. I don't want...

2455
02:51:33,533 --> 02:51:35,534
I don't want anybody frisked.

2456
02:51:37,704 --> 02:51:39,705
We have to change our way
of thinking.

2457
02:51:39,914 --> 02:51:42,040
We have to make people
feel comfortable.

2458
02:51:42,250 --> 02:51:45,836
If I can't be safe around my own kind,
who can I be safe around?

2459
02:51:46,045 --> 02:51:47,879
I trust Allah will protect me.

2460
02:51:48,047 --> 02:51:52,301
Believing in Allah is one thing,
but I also believe in being armed.

2461
02:51:55,555 --> 02:51:59,224
We don't want black people
killing each other, all right?

2462
02:52:01,644 --> 02:52:02,686
All right?

2463
02:52:02,895 --> 02:52:04,604
We'll protect you, Malcolm.

2464
02:52:05,398 --> 02:52:06,606
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

2465
02:52:06,816 --> 02:52:10,402
No, peace be unto you, Earl.
Peace be unto you.

2466
02:52:47,148 --> 02:52:49,483
Good evening.
Do you have a Malcolm X registered?

2467
02:53:47,083 --> 02:53:50,502
Your red nigger is dead
and so are your bastard children!

2468
02:54:15,486 --> 02:54:17,362
- Hello.
- Wake up, brother.

2469
02:54:17,905 --> 02:54:19,781
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

2470
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:31,460
You hear me and hear me well.
You come anywhere near my family...

2471
02:54:31,627 --> 02:54:33,712
- and I will kill you.
- Betty?

2472
02:54:33,880 --> 02:54:35,046
Do you hear?

2501
02:54:35,214 --> 02:54:36,0SS14
Betty.

2473
02:54:36,382 --> 02:54:39,885
- Betty, it's me. It's Malcolm.
- Malcolm.

2474
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:46,349
They keep calling.

2475
02:54:46,559 --> 02:54:49,853
They keep threatening.
I go crazy every time a phone rings.

2476
02:54:50,062 --> 02:54:53,231
Just don't answer the phone.
Everything will be all right.

2477
02:54:53,441 --> 02:54:55,942
- When will it stop?
- Don't answer the phone.

2478
02:54:57,111 --> 02:55:01,531
- Are the brothers there on post?
- Yes, they're outside.

2479
02:55:01,741 --> 02:55:04,534
Let them answer the phone.
Don't touch the phone.

2480
02:55:04,744 --> 02:55:05,911
Beloved, where are you?

2481
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:07,829
I'm in a hotel.

2482
02:55:09,081 --> 02:55:10,081
In a hotel.

2483
02:55:10,458 --> 02:55:13,126
- The girls asleep?
- Yes.

2484
02:55:13,294 --> 02:55:16,421
I just put them down to bed.

2485
02:55:17,298 --> 02:55:19,466
Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?

2486
02:55:21,761 --> 02:55:23,428
No, I don't think so.

2487
02:55:24,430 --> 02:55:27,265
The girls and I want to see you.
We miss you.

2488
02:55:28,142 --> 02:55:30,143
Betty, it's too dangerous.

2489
02:55:30,937 --> 02:55:33,063
It's been dangerous.

2490
02:55:36,234 --> 02:55:39,277
Listen, I haven't told this to anybody...

2491
02:55:41,989 --> 02:55:43,782
but I've been thinking...

2492
02:55:43,991 --> 02:55:47,327
about what's been happening
to me lately, to us lately...

2493
02:55:48,162 --> 02:55:51,581
and I'm gonna stop saying
the Nation of Islam's behind this.

2494
02:55:51,791 --> 02:55:55,168
I know what they can and can't do.
I trained them.

2495
02:55:57,004 --> 02:56:00,131
Some of the things that have
been happening lately...

2496
02:56:02,176 --> 02:56:05,428
I'm gonna stop saying it's just
the Nation of Islam.

2497
02:56:05,638 --> 02:56:07,681
They're not working alone.

2498
02:56:08,307 --> 02:56:10,141
They're getting a lot of help.

2499
02:56:10,351 --> 02:56:12,143
Are you sure?

2500
02:56:13,020 --> 02:56:14,479
I miss you, Betty.

2501
02:56:18,109 --> 02:56:20,485
You're with us even when you're away.

2502
02:56:20,695 --> 02:56:24,030
Now, listen, you come on down
to the Audubon tomorrow.

2503
02:56:24,991 --> 02:56:28,785
We'll be all right. We're not gonna
let this get us down. We'll be fine.

2504
02:56:28,995 --> 02:56:31,121
You come on down. Bring the girls too.

2505
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:33,915
The girls and I miss you so much.

2506
02:56:34,083 --> 02:56:35,292
I'll see you tomorrow.

2507
02:56:35,501 --> 02:56:37,586
Compared to King, this guy's a monk.

2508
02:56:37,795 --> 02:56:40,839
- Good night. Sleep well. I love you.
- Good night.

2509
02:56:53,853 --> 02:56:56,521
Sweetheart, Attallah, sit back.

2510
02:56:56,731 --> 02:56:59,941
Sit up. Sit up straight.

2511
02:57:26,093 --> 02:57:27,886
Mama, I want the doll.

2512
02:58:01,587 --> 02:58:02,921
Go sit down.

2513
02:58:14,392 --> 02:58:15,433
Sister?

2514
02:58:19,146 --> 02:58:22,107
- What do you say to the nice man?
- Thank you.

2515
02:58:22,274 --> 02:58:24,442
You're very welcome,
my beautiful sister.

2516
02:58:25,569 --> 02:58:26,611
Bye-bye.

2517
02:58:43,003 --> 02:58:45,296
The minister hasn't arrived yet.

2518
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:48,133
Don't worry.
He'll be here like clockwork.

2519
02:59:21,250 --> 02:59:22,333
Son?

2520
02:59:22,543 --> 02:59:23,668
Son?

2521
02:59:24,837 --> 02:59:26,296
Are you all right?

2522
02:59:26,505 --> 02:59:27,547
Are you okay?

2523
02:59:30,301 --> 02:59:33,303
- Yeah.
- Good. I recognize you.

2524
02:59:33,512 --> 02:59:36,014
Don't you pay them folks
no never mind.

2525
02:59:36,223 --> 02:59:38,850
You just keep right on doing
what you doing.

2526
02:59:40,936 --> 02:59:42,103
Yes, ma'am.

2527
02:59:42,871 --> 02:59:45,023
- I'll pray for you, son.
- Well, thank you.

2528
02:59:45,399 --> 02:59:47,275
Jesus will protect you.

2529
03:00:01,707 --> 03:00:03,208
Is the charter ready?

2530
03:00:03,375 --> 03:00:05,502
- No, Brother Minister.
- No?

2531
03:00:07,087 --> 03:00:08,546
No? Why not?

2532
03:00:10,925 --> 03:00:12,842
You had enough time, didn't you?

2533
03:00:13,052 --> 03:00:15,345
I apologize.
We'll have it next week.

2534
03:00:15,554 --> 03:00:17,847
We don't have next week.
We need it today.

2535
03:00:18,057 --> 03:00:20,391
The people want to hear
the charter today.

2536
03:00:20,601 --> 03:00:22,268
Next week, Minister.

2537
03:00:28,734 --> 03:00:30,109
Is the reverend here?

2538
03:00:30,444 --> 03:00:33,738
The reverend called and said
he wouldn't be able to attend.

2539
03:00:35,241 --> 03:00:38,743
So now we don't have
an opening speaker or a charter...

2540
03:00:39,537 --> 03:00:42,372
Why didn't you say this last night
when I talked to you?

2541
03:00:42,581 --> 03:00:45,416
- I called Sister Betty...
- You didn't have to call her.

2542
03:00:45,626 --> 03:00:47,585
You should've told me.
Why tell her?

2543
03:00:47,795 --> 03:00:50,088
- I assumed that...
- Don't assume anything!

2544
03:01:00,599 --> 03:01:01,766
Go on down front.

2545
03:01:02,101 --> 03:01:04,644
- Sister, you go on with the brother.
- Yes, sir.

2546
03:01:19,410 --> 03:01:20,660
Malcolm...

2547
03:01:23,289 --> 03:01:24,497
What's wrong?

2548
03:01:29,003 --> 03:01:31,337
It's a time for martyrs now.

2549
03:01:35,050 --> 03:01:36,926
The way I feel...

2550
03:01:38,345 --> 03:01:40,430
I shouldn't go out there today.

2551
03:01:42,016 --> 03:01:44,517
Fine. Let's cancel it.

2552
03:01:47,521 --> 03:01:49,689
My wife out there? My children?

2553
03:01:50,107 --> 03:01:52,108
Down front, as always.

2554
03:01:55,112 --> 03:01:57,780
Go out to the pay phone outside.

2555
03:01:59,283 --> 03:02:03,578
Call up the reverend,
see if he can make it down here.

2556
03:02:03,787 --> 03:02:07,957
I gotta be on post, Malcolm.
I'm supposed to be out there guarding you.

2557
03:02:08,167 --> 03:02:13,087
- Besides, that's a duty for secretaries...
- Go out to the pay phone.

2558
03:02:13,631 --> 03:02:15,214
Call up the reverend.

2559
03:02:15,716 --> 03:02:17,550
See if he can make it down here.

2560
03:02:22,014 --> 03:02:23,222
Fine.

2561
03:03:12,189 --> 03:03:15,441
Please, let's settle down.
Let's get the program started.

2562
03:03:18,570 --> 03:03:19,862
Thank you.

2563
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:27,495
I apologize for raising
my voice earlier.

2564
03:03:27,705 --> 03:03:29,288
It was very disrespectful.

2565
03:03:29,540 --> 03:03:32,041
Brother Minister, I understand.

2566
03:03:41,051 --> 03:03:42,343
Why, styles are changing...

2567
03:03:42,511 --> 03:03:45,430
minds are changing,
why, everything is changing.

2568
03:03:46,098 --> 03:03:50,143
So you and I must consider that
we're living in very changing times.

2569
03:03:50,561 --> 03:03:54,022
And what might be true today
may not be true tomorrow.

2570
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:57,608
And without any further ado,
I present to you...

2571
03:03:58,068 --> 03:04:00,778
Brother Minister Malcolm.
And I pray...

2572
03:04:01,238 --> 03:04:04,949
that you and I will listen. Listen...

2573
03:04:05,576 --> 03:04:09,120
hear and understand. Thank you.

2574
03:04:16,128 --> 03:04:17,462
Daddy!

2575
03:04:31,810 --> 03:04:33,978
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2576
03:04:35,689 --> 03:04:36,814
Brother...

2577
03:04:36,982 --> 03:04:38,107
Please. Hold it.

2578
03:04:39,777 --> 03:04:41,819
Calm down. Please, brothers!

2579
03:04:41,987 --> 03:04:43,029
Brothers...

2580
03:04:43,489 --> 03:04:44,781
Malcolm!

2581
03:04:46,408 --> 03:04:47,658
Malcolm!

2582
03:05:20,526 --> 03:05:21,859
Malcolm!

2583
03:05:24,655 --> 03:05:26,739
Get an ambulance!

2584
03:05:26,949 --> 03:05:29,367
- Somebody get an ambulance!
- They killed him!

2585
03:05:31,161 --> 03:05:33,162
They killed him!

2586
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:45,133
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

2587
03:05:48,053 --> 03:05:49,595
Get him!

2588
03:05:51,014 --> 03:05:53,224
He killed Malcolm!

2589
03:06:03,902 --> 03:06:05,862
Back off, people!

2590
03:06:40,147 --> 03:06:42,773
We've got multiple shooting victims.

2591
03:06:52,159 --> 03:06:53,451
Get out of the way!

2592
03:06:58,707 --> 03:06:59,749
Move!

2593
03:07:08,091 --> 03:07:11,052
Stand back! Get out of the way!
Get back!

2594
03:07:12,930 --> 03:07:15,389
Give us a statement, sir! Please!

2595
03:07:15,599 --> 03:07:19,018
The person you know
as Malcolm X is no more.

2596
03:07:19,353 --> 03:07:21,354
The assassination...

2597
03:07:21,605 --> 03:07:25,191
of Malcolm X was
an unfortunate tragedy.

2598
03:07:25,609 --> 03:07:28,277
And it reveals that
there are still...

2599
03:07:28,612 --> 03:07:31,697
numerous people
in our nation who have...

2600
03:07:31,949 --> 03:07:36,619
degenerated to the point of
expressing dissent through murder...

2601
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:41,415
and we haven't learned to disagree
without being violently disagreeable.

2602
03:07:42,709 --> 03:07:43,793
Here...

2603
03:07:44,544 --> 03:07:47,213
at this final hour...

2604
03:07:47,798 --> 03:07:50,049
in this quiet place...

2605
03:07:50,759 --> 03:07:53,052
Harlem has come to bid farewell...

2606
03:07:53,262 --> 03:07:55,680
to one of its brightest hopes...

2607
03:07:56,682 --> 03:07:58,683
extinguished now...

2608
03:07:59,142 --> 03:08:01,811
and gone from us forever.

2609
03:08:02,688 --> 03:08:05,731
It is not in the memory
of man that this...

2610
03:08:05,941 --> 03:08:07,525
beleaguered, unfortunate...

2611
03:08:07,693 --> 03:08:09,860
but nonetheless proud community...

2612
03:08:10,237 --> 03:08:14,657
has found a braver,
more gallant young champion...

2613
03:08:14,908 --> 03:08:18,369
than this Afro-American
who lies before us...

2614
03:08:19,329 --> 03:08:21,330
unconquered still.

2615
03:08:23,208 --> 03:08:25,584
I say the word again as
he would want me to.

2616
03:08:25,794 --> 03:08:27,169
Afro-American.

2617
03:08:27,379 --> 03:08:30,715
Afro-American Malcolm.

2618
03:08:30,882 --> 03:08:33,634
Malcolm had stopped being Negro...

2619
03:08:33,844 --> 03:08:35,177
years ago.

2620
03:08:35,387 --> 03:08:40,349
It had become too small, too puny,
too weak a word for him.

2621
03:08:40,684 --> 03:08:42,893
Malcolm was bigger than that.

2622
03:08:43,186 --> 03:08:44,478
Malcolm had become...

2623
03:08:44,730 --> 03:08:46,939
an Afro-American.

2624
03:08:47,232 --> 03:08:49,442
And he wanted so desperately...

2625
03:08:49,985 --> 03:08:52,570
that we, that all his people...

2626
03:08:52,779 --> 03:08:55,906
would become Afro-Americans too.

2627
03:08:59,911 --> 03:09:03,372
There are those who
still consider it their duty...

2628
03:09:03,582 --> 03:09:07,251
as friends of the Negro people,
to tell us...

2629
03:09:07,794 --> 03:09:09,545
to revile him.

2630
03:09:09,755 --> 03:09:13,049
To flee, even from
the presence of his memory.

2631
03:09:13,258 --> 03:09:14,759
To save ourselves...

2632
03:09:14,968 --> 03:09:19,555
by writing him out of
the history of our turbulent times.

2633
03:09:19,931 --> 03:09:21,974
And we will smile.

2634
03:09:22,267 --> 03:09:24,602
They will say that
he is of hate, a fanatic...

2635
03:09:24,811 --> 03:09:27,813
a racist, who can only bring
evil to the cause...

2636
03:09:28,023 --> 03:09:29,440
for which you struggle.

2637
03:09:29,649 --> 03:09:32,610
And we will answer and
say unto them...

2638
03:09:32,819 --> 03:09:34,779
Did you ever talk...

2639
03:09:35,155 --> 03:09:36,822
to Brother Malcolm?

2640
03:09:37,449 --> 03:09:39,283
Did you ever touch him...

2641
03:09:39,493 --> 03:09:41,619
or have him smile at you?

2642
03:09:41,828 --> 03:09:44,246
Did you ever really listen to him?

2643
03:09:44,414 --> 03:09:46,290
You haven't done the right thing.

2644
03:09:46,458 --> 03:09:50,628
Was he ever associated
with violence or any public disturbance?

2645
03:09:50,837 --> 03:09:53,756
For if you did, you would know him.

2646
03:09:53,965 --> 03:09:55,466
And if you knew him...

2647
03:09:55,675 --> 03:09:59,428
you would know why
we must honor him.

2648
03:09:59,638 --> 03:10:03,974
Malcolm was our manhood.
Our living, black manhood.

2649
03:10:04,184 --> 03:10:06,268
This was his meaning
to his people.

2650
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:11,148
And in honoring him,
we honor the best in ourselves.

2651
03:10:12,484 --> 03:10:15,152
However much we may have
differed with him...

2652
03:10:15,362 --> 03:10:18,447
or with each other about him
and his value as a man...

2653
03:10:18,657 --> 03:10:20,783
let his going from us serve...

2654
03:10:20,992 --> 03:10:24,036
only to bring us together now...

2655
03:10:25,038 --> 03:10:27,706
consigning these mortal
remains to earth...

2656
03:10:28,208 --> 03:10:30,292
the common mother of all...

2657
03:10:30,502 --> 03:10:33,838
secure in the knowledge
that what we place in the ground...

2658
03:10:34,005 --> 03:10:35,339
is no more now a man...

2659
03:10:35,632 --> 03:10:37,174
but a seed...

2660
03:10:37,509 --> 03:10:40,469
which after the winter of
our discontent...

2661
03:10:40,679 --> 03:10:43,514
will come forth again to meet us.

2662
03:10:43,723 --> 03:10:45,975
And we shall know him then...

2663
03:10:46,184 --> 03:10:49,019
for what he was and is.

2664
03:10:49,229 --> 03:10:51,021
A prince.

2665
03:10:51,231 --> 03:10:54,859
Our own black shining prince...

2666
03:10:55,569 --> 03:10:58,737
who didn't hesitate to die...

2667
03:10:59,072 --> 03:11:00,406
because...

2668
03:11:01,074 --> 03:11:02,324
he loved us so.

2669
03:11:03,452 --> 03:11:08,038
And so today, May 19th,
we celebrate Malcolm X's birthday...

2670
03:11:08,248 --> 03:11:12,084
because he was a great,
great Afro-American.

2671
03:11:12,377 --> 03:11:15,045
Malcolm X is you, all of you.

2672
03:11:15,422 --> 03:11:17,506
And you are Malcolm X.

2673
03:11:18,049 --> 03:11:20,509
I'm Malcolm X!

2674
03:11:20,677 --> 03:11:22,636
- I'm Malcolm X!
- I'm Malcolm X!

2675
03:11:22,804 --> 03:11:25,055
- I'm Malcolm X!
- I am Malcolm X!

2676
03:11:25,223 --> 03:11:30,853
- I am Malcolm X!
- I am Malcolm X!

2677
03:11:31,021 --> 03:11:33,439
As Brother Malcolm said...

2678
03:11:36,276 --> 03:11:38,235
We declare...

2679
03:11:39,571 --> 03:11:41,238
our right...

2680
03:11:43,366 --> 03:11:45,075
on this earth...

2681
03:11:46,411 --> 03:11:48,037
to be a man...

2682
03:11:50,248 --> 03:11:52,416
to be a human being...

2683
03:11:54,711 --> 03:11:57,087
to be given the rights...

2684
03:11:57,881 --> 03:11:59,590
of a human being...

2685
03:12:01,426 --> 03:12:03,260
to be respected...

2686
03:12:04,429 --> 03:12:06,722
as a human being...

2687
03:12:07,599 --> 03:12:09,892
in this society...

2688
03:12:11,102 --> 03:12:12,937
on this earth...

2689
03:12:14,439 --> 03:12:16,273
in this day...

2690
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:19,527
which we intend to bring...

2691
03:12:19,736 --> 03:12:21,070
into existence...

2692
03:12:21,279 --> 03:12:24,114
by any means necessary!
