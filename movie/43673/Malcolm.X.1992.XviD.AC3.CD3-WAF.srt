1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:04,162
So what I'll do is put the chapters down,
I'll write them down for you.

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,363
All right.

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:09,035
As well as the New Testament chapters
of St Matthew.

4
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:10,581
- Brother Minister.
- Yes?

5
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:13,583
I hope that doesn't mean you won't
come and visit my class, though.

6
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,827
Oh, no! No. I'd love to come to your class.

7
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:18,293
- (chuckles)
- I love to teach. I love sharing.

8
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:20,588
You see, this is the wonderful thing
about Mr Muhammad.

9
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:23,297
When he gives you this knowledge, when
he shares this knowledge with you...

10
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:27,849
...you can't help but to run out and...
- Excuse me, um, Brother Minister...

11
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:31,763
...would it be OK
if we just sat down for a moment?

12
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:35,388
- It's a pretty big building, and, uh...
- Oh, yes.

13
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,688
- (chuckles)
- Yes, sister. I'm sorry.

14
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,527
- I've had you on your feet all day.
- Oh, no. No, no.

15
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:44,526
- My mistake.
- You've been on your feet for days.

16
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,741
And, uh...
you didn't even finish your salad.

17
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,874
- So, let's talk about you for a change.
- Mm.

18
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:58,123
- How tall are you?
- Why do you ask?

19
00:00:58,213 --> 00:00:59,956
- Idle question.
- Oh.

20
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:04,500
Well, if it's just an idle question,
I hope you won't force me to answer it.

21
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:07,756
(chuckles) No. I won't force you.

22
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:16,849
Well, Brother Baines says
that I'm tall enough for a tall man.

23
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:22,065
He's briefed you also, then?
(laughs) How old are you, sister?

24
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:25,198
You know, Brother Malcolm...

25
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:28,982
...there are a few things about women
that you don't understand.

26
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:33,076
- Some of us, we're possessive, very vain.
- Are you?

27
00:01:33,164 --> 00:01:36,616
And persistent,
when we've set our mind to something.

28
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,619
What have you set your mind to?

29
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:44,254
Being a good Muslim...

30
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,709
...a good nurse...

31
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,343
...and a good wife.

32
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:51,589
Brother Malcolm?

33
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,474
- Excuse me, Sister Betty.
- Certainly.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,133
Brother Malcolm, Brother Johnson
was attacked by the police.

35
00:01:58,356 --> 00:01:59,056
Excuse me, sister.

36
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,272
- There was a scuffle!
- The brother was just watchin'!

37
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,978
- The cop came along, he said "Move on!"
- Didn't move quick enough for the ofay!

38
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,278
Crack! He was bleedin' like a stuck hog!

39
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:09,441
So what you gonna do?

40
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:13,037
He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim.

41
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:16,621
But you ain't gonna do nothin'
but make a speech.

42
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,124
Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothin'.

43
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:22,619
Unless somebody bothers Muslims.

44
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:38,432
- Charlie, wait up.
- More troublemakers. Here they come.

45
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:42,973
(* radio plays Perry Como:
"Round And Round")

46
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:45,903
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

47
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:48,063
Who the hell are you?

48
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:49,983
I'm the minister
for Muslim Temple Number Seven.

49
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,317
- Never heard of you.
- Where is he?

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,779
- Nobody here by that name.
- Wait a second. What is your name, fella?

51
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,410
Don't worry about what my name is.

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,991
Two witnesses saw Brother Johnson
brought in here, beat up.

53
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:04,206
- Nobody saw him brought out.
- You didn't hear the sergeant?

54
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,298
- Outside.
- I suggest you look outside that window.

55
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:10,966
* Cos you've found
what you've been dreamin' of

56
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,548
* In the night, you see the oval moon

57
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:19,594
* Going round and round in tune

58
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:23,104
- Jimmy, c'mere a second.
- Yes, we intend to see Brother Johnson.

59
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,693
- Who the hell are they supposed to be?
- They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

60
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,279
Eddie, let me take a look at that blotter.

61
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,247
Uh...

62
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,963
Yeah. We got a Muslim.
Relief musta put it down.

63
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,756
- Must have.
- Yeah, but you can't see him.

64
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:52,258
- Because you ain't his lawyer.
- No lawyer, no see.

65
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:56,888
Well, until I am satisfied Brother Johnson
is receiving proper medical care...

66
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,051
...nobody will move.

67
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:05,846
* Then your love,
you'll hold herround, round, round

68
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,319
* In your heart's a song
with a brand-new...

69
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,780
Get an ambulance.

70
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:15,698
Now!

71
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,715
(siren wails)

72
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:36,629
All right, break it up!
You got what you wanted.

73
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,214
No. I'm not satisfied.

74
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,059
To the hospital.

75
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,888
(* military drumbeat)

76
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,146
(crowd murmurs)

77
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:13,504
- Walk on!
- (shouts and conversation)

78
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,338
Sidney, come on!

79
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,911
(crowd shouts)

80
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,321
Keep fightin', son!

81
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:24,036
- (siren wails)
- (shouting and chanting)

82
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:44,007
(crowd) We want justice!
We want justice! We want justice!

83
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,050
All right, that's enough.
I want these people moved outta here.

84
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:52,725
Fruit of Islam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws. Yet.

85
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,653
- What about them?
- That's your headache, Captain.

86
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:59,071
- But if Brother Johnson dies, I pity you.
- We want justice!

87
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,651
Doctor?

88
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,150
He'll live.
He's getting the best care we can give.

89
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:04,490
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Certainly.

90
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:07,070
- We want justice!
- All right. OK.

91
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:09,372
Now let's disperse this mob!

92
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:13,371
We want justice! We want justice!

93
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:16,874
We want justice! We want justice!

94
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:20,378
We want justice! We want justice!

95
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,095
We want justice! We want justice!

96
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:25,760
We want justice!

97
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,677
(scattered shouts)

98
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,928
That's too much power
for one man to have.

99
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:08,426
Brother Minister,
I'm ready to take some heads.

100
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:10,967
We gotta do somethin'
to put fear in those devils!

101
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,889
Look, I'm ready to do something also.

102
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:15,602
Chicago said to be patient,
that's what we're gonna do.

103
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,563
- I'm tired of being patient!
- Well, then you get on the phone...

104
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,645
(lowers voice) You get on the phone and
you call Chicago, let Mr Muhammad know.

105
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,327
(Elijah Muhammad) I am here
to bring a solution to the problems of...

106
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:33,865
...(chuckles) the so-called Negro
and his white slave master.

107
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,459
You are seeking something.

108
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:41,129
- Have a seat, son.
- You are seeking...

109
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:44,503
...an answer to your 400 years of slavery.

110
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,680
Y'know, the only thing I like integrated...

111
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,390
...is my coffee.

112
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:53,094
- (laughs)
- What can I do for you?

113
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,564
Well, Mr X, uh...

114
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:02,812
...my name is Benjamin.
And I was out there tonight.

115
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,565
Take it easy, now.

116
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,446
And... and I saw what it is that you did.

117
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:11,988
I mean, the way you talked
to them policemen and all.

118
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,999
Well, Mr X...

119
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,046
...I wanna be a Muslim.

120
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:26,427
I mean, I ain't never seen a nigger,
uh, I mean, coloured person...

121
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,346
...Negro...

122
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:32,722
...talk to no police like that before.

123
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:35,266
You want to be a Muslim,
join the Nation of Islam.

124
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:38,973
- Yes, sir.
- You know what it means to be a Muslim?

125
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:43,192
Do you?

126
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:48,742
Um... (clears throat) No, not exactly.
But I wanna be one.

127
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,451
I mean, just like you.

128
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,621
You should never join any organisation
unless you know exactly what it's about.

129
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,295
The Church has failed you!

130
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:02,664
Thank you, brother.

131
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,671
You shouldn't give up so easily, either.

132
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,673
We can use more young warriors
like yourself.

133
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:15,716
Come on by the temple,
next Wednesday, eight o'clock sharp.

134
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:17,769
Yes. Eight o'clock sharp.

135
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:21,272
Thank you, Mr X.
And I won't make you out a liar, neither.

136
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,735
No, I don't think you will.

137
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:28,696
All right!

138
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,487
(chuckles)

139
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,288
Tonight...

140
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:41,586
...I shall introduce you
as my National Minister.

141
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,544
It will be a difficult task.

142
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,049
Your assignment...

143
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:51,220
...is to build temples all over this nation.

144
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:54,177
More work
than you've ever done in your life.

145
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,011
- Yes, sir.
- (chuckles)

146
00:10:56,102 --> 00:11:00,645
You will be in the public eye.
Beware of them cameras.

147
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,522
Oh, those cameras are...

148
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,400
...bad as any narcotic.

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,869
White devil be watchin' your every step.

150
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:15,954
- Yes.
- And your own brothers will be...

151
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:19,121
...jealous...

152
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,248
...hostile.

153
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,127
Go slowly.

154
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,414
Yes, sir.

155
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,334
Here is a glass.

156
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:32,002
Mm-hm.

157
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:36,976
Dirty. The water? Foul.

158
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:43,398
If you offer this to the people,
they have no choice.

159
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:47,525
They'll drink from it, if they're thirsty.

160
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:51,528
- (chuckles)
- But if you offer them...

161
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,739
...this glass...

162
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,283
...and let them make their own decision...

163
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,370
...they will choose the pure vessel.

164
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:09,255
Islam is the only religion...

165
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:14,011
...that addresses the needs
and the problems...

166
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:16,137
...of the so-called Negro in America...

167
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:18,513
...especially in the slums...
- Right.

168
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,641
...ghettos.

169
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:24,940
Islam is the only way
out of drugs, and crime, and...

170
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,892
...unemployment, prostitution, alcohol...

171
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,737
...gambling and... adultery, fornication.

172
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:38,032
This sweet, gentle man
at whose feet I kneeled...

173
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,161
...gave me the truth from his own mouth.

174
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:41,707
Present them the pure vessel.

175
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:45,706
And I adored him in the sense of
the Latin root of the word "adorare"...

176
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,369
...which means to worship and to fear.

177
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:50,541
He was the first man I ever feared...

178
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,635
...and I don't mean fear
such as one has of a gun...

179
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,014
...but the fear one has of the...
of the power of the sun.

180
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:01,219
I pledged myself to him,
even ifit cost me my life.

181
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,102
(telephone rings)

182
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,097
Hello?

183
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,601
- Hello, Betty?
- Yes?

184
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:08,102
Yes, this is Malcolm.

185
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,071
- I know.
- Right. I'm here in Detroit.

186
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:17,323
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

187
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,202
You heard what I said, right?

188
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,778
- Did you hearmy answer?
- Yes, I think so.

189
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:22,904
Brother Malcolm?

190
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,288
- (laughs)
- Are you eating?

191
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:28,247
- Yeah, I've been eating. Mm-hm.
- (laughs) Good.

192
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,212
I love you, Betty.

193
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,965
I love you back.

194
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,551

195
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,175

* Ella Fitzgerald: "Azure"

197
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:48,183
- It's not gonna be easy.
- No choice.

198
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,184
I'll be away a lot.

199
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,401
I know.

200
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,033
- In fact, I'm leaving in the morning.
- Oh, hush now. Shh.

...on the way up to Boston...
- Malcolm.

204
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:11,252
Shh.

205
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:16,542
You're with me...

206
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:18,921
...even when you're away.

210
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:38,314
I've never told you this.

211
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:43,870
But the very first time I ever saw you...

212
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:47,114
...standing up on the podium...

213
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:52,171
...you were cleaning your glasses...

214
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,755
...and I felt so sorry for you.

215
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,717
- Sorry for me?
- Mm-hm.

216
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:00,836
Why?

217
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:05,343
Because no-one as young as you
should be so serious.

218
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:11,066
But I don't think that any more.

219
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,356
What do you think?

220
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:18,316
I want to have a lot of babies with you.

221
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,532
(softly) Dear heart.

222
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,578
- (knock at door)
- I love you.

223
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:32,704
We're waitin' on you folks.
You tryin' to starve us?

224
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:38,333
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty...

225
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:42,590
...we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and a fruitful marriage.

226
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,969
(laughter)

227
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:48,474
That's right!
Congratulations, Brother Minister!

228
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:50,887
- Congratulations!
- You made the front page!

229
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:53,057
Check it out! Front page!

230
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,771
(laughter and applause)

231
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:01,781
I must emphasise that The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.

232
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:05,781
So I'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican...

233
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:09,413
...nor as a Democrat.
- Tell us, brother!

234
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:13,283
- Not as a Mason, nor as an Elk.
- Tell us what you here for!

235
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:16,379
- Not as a Protestant, nor a Catholic.
- That's right!

236
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:19,252
- Not as a Christian, nor a Jew.
- C'mon, man! All right, now.

237
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:22,379
- Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist. In fact...
- Come on, brother! Come on!

238
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,961
...not even as an American.
- (approving shouts)

239
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:27,345
Because if I was an American...

240
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:29,972
...the problem that confronts
our people today wouldn't even exist!

241
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:33,098
- That's right!
- So now we ain't Americans, huh?

242
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,733
So I have to stand here today
as what I was when I was born.

243
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:42,067
- A black man.
- (shouting and applause)

244
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:47,369
Before there was any such thing
as a Republican or a Democrat...

245
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:48,865
...we were black.

246
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:52,870
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

247
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,502
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

248
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,883
In fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

249
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:07,384
And after America has long passed from
the scene, there will still be black people.

250
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:09,513
(cheering)

251
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,174
I'm gonna tell it like it really is!

252
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:17,558
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us!

253
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,568
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man!

254
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:24,949
This is what they do! They send drugs
into Harlem down here to pacify us!

255
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,868
They send alcohol down here to pacify us!

256
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:31,286
They send prostitution
down here to pacify us!

257
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:35,157
You can't even get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission!

258
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:38,537
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission!

259
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,750
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission!

260
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,759
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle...

261
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:47,514
...that's a government seal
you're breaking!

262
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:50,088
No, I say and I say it again...

263
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:53,054
...you've been had! You've been took!

264
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:56,893
- Right on, brother!
- You've been hoodwinked! Bamboozled!

265
00:17:56,982 --> 00:18:00,814
Led astray! Run amok!
This is what he does.

266
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:04,105
Y'know,
some people call this hate teaching.

267
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:06,071
But this isn't hate teaching.

268
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,530
- This is love teaching.
- (approving shouts)

269
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:11,453
- I wouldn't tell you this if I didn't love you.
- No, you wouldn't!

270
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,076
I wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if I didn't love you.

271
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,628
I want you to understand one thing,
everything that I teach you...

272
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,843
...everything that I've said to you...

273
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:24,427
...has been taught to me
by this dear man, this divine man.

274
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,096
Yes, sir!

275
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:29,520
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

276
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:32,810
- (Malcolm X) Oh, yes!
- (Betty) Attallah's fine...

277
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:35,191
...and misses you as much as I do.

278
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,066
But the news that you've
dedicated fournew temples...

279
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,280
...is almost as good as having you with us.

280
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:44,531
- (Malcolm X) And the white people...
- (Betty) Please take care of yourself.

281
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:48,205
...try to hide theirguilt by accusing
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad...

282
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,415
...of being a black supremacist...

283
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:53,041
...simply because he's trying
to uplift the mentality...

284
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,622
...the social and economic
condition of his people.

285
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:56,968
And the Jews...

286
00:18:56,968 --> 00:19:00,052
...who have been guilty of exploiting
black people for I don't know how long...

287
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,222
...try to hide theirguilt by accusing
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad...

288
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,977
...of being anti-Semitic...

289
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,559
...simply because he's trying
to teach you and I...

290
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,814
Simply because he's trying
to teach you and I to...

291
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,107
...to be in charge of the businesses
in our own community...

292
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:18,029
...to own the businesses
in our own community...

293
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:20,403
...to have economic leadership
in our own community!

294
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:24,109
- No! No, this isn't black supremacy!
- (screaming and shouting)

295
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:26,362
- This is black intelligence!
- That's right!

296
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,365
- That's right!
- (applause)

297
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:29,738
Come on!

298
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:34,542
I didn't do nothin'! I didn't do nothin'!

299
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,002
(applause, TV announcer)

300
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,009
* We are not afraid... *

301
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,136
The black people in this country...

302
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:46,216
Keep those people back!

303
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:51,350
...have been the victims of violence
at the hands of the American white man...

304
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:54,108
...for 400 years.

305
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,948
And we thought, by following
those ignorant Negro preachers...

306
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:10,410
...it was godlike to turn the other cheek
to the brute that was brutalising us!

307
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,086
A hundred years ago, they used to put on
white sheets and sic bloodhounds on us.

308
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:19,586
Well, nowadays
they've traded in the sheets...

309
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:21,300
Well, some of them have.

310
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:22,465
(applause)

311
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,842
- They've traded in the sheets...
- (applause swells)

312
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:29,225
Please... please. They've traded in
those white sheets for police uniforms.

313
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,224
They've traded in
the bloodhounds for police dogs.

314
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:36,101
Andjust like that old Uncle Tom
back during slavery time...

315
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:38,564
We must remain true to non-violence.

316
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,404
I'm asking everybody in the line...

317
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,731
...if you can't be non-violent, don't get in it.

318
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,991
...teaching us to love our enemy
and pray for those who use us spitefully...

319
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:51,289
...you got these chicken-peckin' Uncle Tom
so-called Negro leaders today...

320
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:53,662
But isn't it a great day?

321
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:57,583
You've got these
Uncle Tom Negro leaders today...

322
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:00,376
...that are telling us
we oughta pray for our enemy...

323
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,589
...we oughta love our enemy...

324
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:06,010
...we oughta integrate with an enemy
who bombs us, who kills and shoots us...

325
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:10,558
...who lynches us,
who rapes our women and children. No!

326
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,801
- That's right! C'mon!
- No!

327
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:17,059
No! That's not intelligent.
That's not intelligent!

328
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,067
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to teach you and I...

329
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,522
...that just as the white man, and any
other man, for that matter, on this earth...

330
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:26,900
...has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

331
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:30,278
...the natural right and any other kind
of high rights you can think of...

332
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,494
...to protect himself...

333
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,998
...just as this white man
has the right to defend himself...

334
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:39,544
...we have the right
to defend ourselves, too.

335
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,132
This is only natural.

336
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,002
This is what The Honourable Elijah
Muhammad is trying to teach you and I.

337
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:48,672
He's not teaching us to hate the white
man. He's teaching us to love ourselves.

338
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:53,889
Mr X, before we begin
our discussion tonight...

339
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:57,679
..."The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...

340
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:01,723
...would you mind explaining for us
the meaning of yourname...

341
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:04,489
...which is the letter... X?

342
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:06,730
Yes, uh, during slavery time...

343
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:10,442
...the slave master gave the Negro,
so-called Negro...

344
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:14,993
...uh, named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

345
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:17,122
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

346
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,875
...that once we come into the knowledge
of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves...

347
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,841
...we replace our slave name with an X...

348
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:27,008
...X in mathematics
representing the unknown.

349
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:29,134
Since we've been
disconnected or cut off...

350
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,266
...from our own history, our own past,
our own culture, our own land...

351
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,218
...we use the X, the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

352
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:40,647
I see. Thank you. Er, Dr Payson?

353
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:43,688
Mr X is a... He's a demagogue.

354
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:46,695
He has no place to go, so he exaggerates.

355
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,402
He's a disservice
to every good, law-abiding...

356
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,983
...churchgoing American Negro
in the country.

357
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:54,035
- (scattered applause)
- Mr Malcolm X...

358
00:22:56,207 --> 00:23:01,367
...why do you teach black supremacy?
Why... why do you teach hate?

359
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:06,380
Well, for the white man
to ask the black man...

360
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,627
...why he hates him...

361
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:11,347
...is like the wolf asking the sheep...

362
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:14,134
...or the rapist asking the raped:
"Do you hate me?"

363
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:17,890
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

364
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,018
This is a black man asking the question.

365
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:24,400
What would you call an educated Negro
with a BA, or an MA, or a BS or a PhD?

366
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:28,068
I'll tell you. You call him a nigger. That's
what the white man calls him, a nigger.

367
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,693
Now, you have to understand
this type of thinking...

368
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:34,947
...and to understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

369
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:38,157
...there were two types of slaves:
The house Negro and the field Negro.

370
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:41,369
The house Negro lived in the house,
next to his master...

371
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,165
...in the big house,
either in the basement or up in the attic.

372
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:47,172
He'd dress pretty good, he ate
pretty good, what the master left him.

373
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:48,836
He loved his master.

374
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:52,378
I'd say he loved his master
better than the master loved himself.

375
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,511
If the master said
"We got a nice house here"...

376
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,757
...he'd say
"Yeah, boss, we got a nice house here."

377
00:23:56,851 --> 00:24:01,347
Master's house is on fire, the house Negro
would be running to put the blaze out.

378
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:05,057
If the master got sick, he'd say
"What's the matter, boss? We sick?"

379
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,980
"We sick." You see,
this is the thinking of the house Negro.

380
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,156
Now, if another slave
came up to him and said...

381
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:13,026
..."Let's run away, let's separate,
let's get away from this cruel master,"...

382
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:15,952
...he said "Why?
What's better than what we got here?"

383
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,610
"Run away? I'm not going anywhere!"
This is the house Negro.

384
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,615
We called 'em the house nigger.

385
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,920
And that's what we call 'em today.
We still got a lot of house niggers.

386
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:26,997
Dear Holy Apostle...

387
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,302
...the ministers think
Malcolm is getting too much press.

388
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:36,057
They think he thinks
he is the Nation of Islam.

389
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,100
That he has aspirations to lead the Nation.

390
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,053
You made Malcolm the man he is.

391
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:46,271
You lifted him out of the darkness.

392
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,482
You...

393
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:56,197
You go and tell the brothers
that what the Brother Minister is doing...

394
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:57,537
...has done...

395
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,071
...has been of great benefit to the Nation.

396
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,125
And you tell them that I say so.

397
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,962
The ministers think
he is of great benefit to himself.

398
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:14,467
(shouting)

399
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,590
- Do you have any white friends?
- One question at a time.

400
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,098
- Did you say white people are devils, sir?
- Yes, I've said white people are devils.

401
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:25,100
- Should all blacks be armed, sir?
- Well, one of your most famous men said:

402
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:29,139
..."Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition." That's the way you think.

403
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:31,773
Malcolm, do you think your cause
will be successful?

404
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,238
I sincerely hope so.

405
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:35,992
- Do you advocate violence?
- No, sir.

406
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:38,115
Has there been a white man
who's helped your people in history?

407
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:41,120
Has there been a white man
that's helped my people in history?

408
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,827
- That's correct, sir.
- I don't understand the question.

409
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,708
You preach anti-white,
anti-Christian science.

410
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:49,577
- Are you saying you're anti-white?
- No, you're saying I'm anti-white.

411
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:50,917
Are all white people devils?

412
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,379
- Do you only educate young black men?
- Well, we gotta move out.

413
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:57,086
- We've got a plane to catch.
- (reporters shout)

414
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,006
Excuse me. Mr X? Um...

415
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,758
Hi, I... I've read some of your speeches...

416
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,102
...and I honestly believe
that a lot of what you have to say is true...

417
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,807
...and, and I'm a good person
in spite of what my ancestors did...

418
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,111
...and I just... I wanted to ask you...

419
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:15,278
...what can a white person like myself
who isn't prejudiced...

420
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:18,864
...what can I do to help you
and further your cause?

421
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,116
Nothing.

422
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:32,959
My high school was a black ghetto
in Roxbury, right here in Boston.

423
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,917
I got my college education on the streets
of Harlem, in New York City.

424
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,299
I took my Master's degree in prison,
over the course of six and a half years.

425
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,434
In fact, my old burglary hang-out
was just outside this campus.

426
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,764
I lived like an animal.

427
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,817
I stole. I used drugs.

428
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,740
I smoked reefers. Cocaine.

429
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,079
I committed adultery. Had it not been
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad...

430
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,914
...l'd have surely been
in an insane asylum, or dead.

431
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,042
Or possibly even
the murderer of one of you.

432
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:13,623
So what is Mr Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side...

433
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:17,214
...so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

434
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:20,421
When the Negro, the so-called Negro
in America gets on God's side...

435
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,218
...and listens to the teachings
of The Honourable Elijah Muhammad...

436
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:26,972
...he'll want to get off of drugs.
He'll want to get away from a life of crime.

437
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,552
He'll want to get away from
committing adultery and fornication.

438
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,731
Then he would want to get off the welfare.
He would want to get a job...

439
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,435
...earn a living and take care of
his family, and they would respect him.

440
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,198
His son will say
"I'm proud that that's my father."

441
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,236
His wife will say
"I'm proud that that's my husband."

442
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,909
"Father" only means
that you're taking care of your children.

443
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,111
That's what it is to be a father.

444
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:51,868
"Father" doesn't mean that you're having
some babies. Anybody can have a baby.

445
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:57,002
Anybody can go out and get a woman, but
not anybody can take care of that woman.

446
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:59,926
There's another word for it.
It's called responsibility.

447
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,966
If the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen...

448
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:07,180
...we wouldn't have a racial problem.

449
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,388
If the Emancipation Proclamation was
true, we wouldn't have a race problem.

450
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,857
If the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments
to the Constitution were authentic...

451
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,437
...we wouldn't have a race problem.

452
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,852
If the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic...

453
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:21,069
...we would not have a race problem!

454
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:24,909
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy!

455
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,699
These Negro leaders are running around
telling the white man...

456
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:30,873
...that everything is all right,
that we got everything under control...

457
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,580
...that everything The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad teaches is wrong.

458
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:36,754
But I'm telling you, Mr Muhammad said
these things were gonna come to pass...

459
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,413
...and now these things
are starting to come to pass.

460
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,213
(loud cheering)

461
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,924
Now, these same Negro leaders...

462
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:50,174
...who are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion...

463
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,805
(chuckles)
Yes, there's gonna be a racial explosion.

464
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,525
And a racial explosion is more dangerous
than an atomic explosion!

465
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,854
(shouting and applause)

466
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:06,195
There's going to be an explosion
because black people are dissatisfied.

467
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:08,693
They're dissatisfied
not only with the white man...

468
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,911
...but with these
Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

469
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:13,572
...that are trying to pose
as spokesmen for you and I!

470
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,791
(wild cheering)

471
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:18,334
Just like you have a powder keg...

472
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:21,423
...when you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks around it...

473
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,548
...the thing's going to explode.

474
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,087
And if the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house...

475
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:30,266
...and if it explodes,
then the house is going to be destroyed.

476
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,435
I said, the house is going to be destroyed!

477
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,274
So The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is teaching you and I...

478
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,223
...and trying to tell the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house!

479
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,893
Let the black man
separate from his house!

480
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,112
Let the black man have his own house!

481
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:48,070
Let the black man have his own land,
and his own property!

482
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,948
(wild cheering)

483
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,205
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to tell the white man...

484
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,040
...that this thing, this explosion,
is gonna bring down his house.

485
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,881
This is what he's trying to tell him,
and more importantly...

486
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,836
...he's trying to tell 'em
that if he doesn't do something about it...

487
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:05,966
- Uh-huh!
...if he doesn't do something about it...

488
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,797
...it's gonna explode any day now.

489
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,217
Oh, yes, it is.

490
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,177
I'm just here to tell you
and I'm gonna make it very short.

491
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,810
Preach, Brother! Preach on!

492
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm here to tell you about the Honourable
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

493
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:22,145
His greatest greatness is that he has
the only solution for peace in this country.

494
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:26,151
The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad's solution...

495
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,529
...is the only solution for you and I.

496
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,572
It's the only solution for the white man.

497
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,952
Complete separation...

498
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,582
...between the black race
and the white race.

499
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,792
(cheering)

500
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,122
It's the only solution!

501
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:47,045
(crowd chants) All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

502
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,343
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

503
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,922
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

504
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,258
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

505
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,925
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

506
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,014
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

507
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,764
All praise is due to Allah
for the Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

508
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:04,143
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

509
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,728
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

510
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,445
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

511
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,260
Brother Malcolm!

512
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,924
Yes. Yes. Hold on.

513
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,602
Yes, sir. It's all right.
My brother, how you doin'?

514
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,847
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, anything.

515
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,099
Are you Elijah's... pimp?

516
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,776
- (woman) He should be killed...
- Wait, hold it. Hold on. Hold on.

517
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,696
- What are you saying, brother?
- (whispers) "His greatest greatness."

518
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,406
Just say what you're saying.

519
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:58,910
If you don't know, man,
I feel the sorriest for you.

520
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,997
(chuckling) Oh, come on, brother. Wait.
Look, let me tell you something...

521
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,839
- No, let me tell you...
- Haul him out! Get him out of here!

522
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,046
Stop! You gotta get out!

523
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,340
Get out before it's too late!

524
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,001
- Don't, Malcolm! Get out!
- Disrespectin' the black man! Get him out!

525
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,264
- It's all right. It's all right!
- Get out, Malcolm!

526
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,473
- Sir?
- You all right, Brother Malcolm?

527
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,855
He's just hungry for knowledge, that's all.
Yeah, that brother's starving.

528
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,475
- Yes, sir.
- So am I. Let's get something to eat.

529
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,732
(chuckles)

530
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,113
- All right. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- OK. Night-night, Daddy.

531
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,322
Night-night.

532
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,877
(groans) Oh...

533
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,836
Long night. (sighs)

534
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,174
(chuckles) Oh, yeah.

535
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,220
What you lookin' at?

536
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,882
- You.
- Why are you lookin' at me like that?

537
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,353
Because you're in trouble.

538
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,597
How do you know that?

539
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,776
Oh, dear heart.

540
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,815
Because I know you.

541
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,436
Well, if you know me...

542
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,406
...you know that I don't like to bring
my troubles into my house.

543
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,245
Mm? Mm. You know that also.

544
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,825
- Yes, I do.
- OK.

545
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,833
But I'm not made of glass,
and I won't break.

546
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,433
Look, Betty, I just want peace.

547
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:44,931
I want to sit here with you,
I want to... be still.

548
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,980
I want peace in my house.

549
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,732
- Have we ever had a fight?
- Never.

550
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,322
- Argument?
- Never had one, no.

551
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,325
We're gonna have one...

552
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,786
...right now, if you don't talk about it.

553
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,914
- Talk about what, Betty?
- The talk's everywhere.

554
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,205
There's always talk
and there's always gonna be talk.

555
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:12,582
Aren't they talkin' now
about me trying to take over the Nation?

556
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:17,384
Aren't they talkin' about how we're...
gettin' rich off the Nation of Islam(?)

557
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,298
We can talk about that, too.

558
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,973
- Well, let's talk about it.
- It's not just talk any more.

559
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,847
"UPl: Elijah Muhammad...

560
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,024
...67-year-old leader
of the black Muslim movement...

561
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,273
...today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries...

562
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:39,321
- These are slanders, lies.
...he fathered their four children."

563
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,411
Don't you realise
this is the devil's newspaper?

564
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,869
He's trying to divide us.

565
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:50,118
Don't you see that? Divide and conquer.
He's trying to bring down our leader.

566
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,708
"Both women...

567
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,636
...in their twenties, charged that...

568
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,472
...they had intimacies with...
- Intimacies with Mr Muhammad.

569
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,646
You think I'm not aware
of these accusations, Betty?

570
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,989
Huh? You think I'm not aware
of these vicious lies?

571
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,867
Brother Baines and I
were talking about this very thing today.

572
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,574
Baines? Is he your friend?

573
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:28,198
- What's the matter with you.
- Nothing. What's the matter with you?

574
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,993
Wake up! Are you so committed
that you've blinded yourself?

575
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,172
You so dedicated you can't face the truth?

576
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,552
Baines? He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

577
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:44,797
Ask him why your name hasn't appeared
in Muhammad Speaks in over a year!

578
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,104
I am not interested in personal publicity.

579
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,232
- Not one single sentence in your own!
- Our people know what I'm doing.

580
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,724
But do you know what Baines is doing?

581
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,524
What is this "Baines, Baines, Baines"?

582
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,069
Everyone can see this but you! Oh...

583
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,492
Baines is the one who saved my life...

584
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,201
...when I was crawling around
like an animal.

585
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,160
He brought me
to The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

586
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,290
- Yes! A long time ago!
- And The Honourable Elijah Muhammad...

587
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,047
- A long time ago!
...brought me back from the dead!

588
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:20,007
- You've repaid them over and over!
- Don't you raise your voice in my house!

589
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:28,473
Ask them. Ask them why they have new
cars and houses full of furniture. Hm?

590
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,597
Is this what it's about, Betty? Do you want
some new furniture? Do you want cars?

591
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,817
What do we have?
What do we have, Malcolm?

592
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,523
Broken-down jalopy...

593
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,186
...the clothes on our backs. Hm?

594
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,825
- So I'll get you some new clothes.
- We don't even own our own home.

595
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,490
What about our children? What about me?
You don't even own life insurance.

596
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,912
Look, Betty, the Nation of Islam
will provide if anything happens to me.

597
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,044
Will they?

598
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,254
Are you sure?

599
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,132
Are you sure?

600
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,551
Are you sure?

601
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,638
Or are you blind?

602
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,803
All right.

603
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,936
(drawer slams shut)

604
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,018
Um...

605
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,029
...l've got work to do, so...

606
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,859
There's always work to do.

607
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,072
- Sweetheart, you got to help me.
- I'm trying.

608
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:29,027
I'm raisin' our children almost by myself.
You're runnin' all over the country...

609
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,447
Do you want me to stay home?

610
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,114
You don't know how many times
they ask me "Where's my daddy?"

611
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,290
Do you want me to cook the food?
Make the beds and do everything?

612
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,172
- These people need me.
- We need you. We need you!

613
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,297
Well, I need you, too!
But what do you want me to do?

614
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:46,085
- Tell me! What do you want me to do?
- Open your eyes.

615
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,051
You can face death 24 hours a day...

616
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:53,471
...but the possibility of betrayal
never enters your head.

617
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,688
Open your eyes.

618
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,474
- As salaam alaikum, Brother Minister.
- Wa-alaikum salaam, sister.

619
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,723
Her name's Eva Marie.

620
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,225
And she's two years old.

621
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,568
Brother Minister,
I didn't do anything wrong.

622
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,235
I didn't do anything to be put in isolation.

623
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,327
I believed in him.

624
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,789
I believed in The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad.

625
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,001
Believe in Allah.

626
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,379
(strains)

627
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:10,380
This is Saudi, she's two.
You have Lisha. She's three.

628
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,060
From their mouths, I heard their stories
of who had fathered their children...

629
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,729
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is the father of my children.

630
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:20,146
...and that The Honourable Elijah
Muhammad had told them I was his best...

631
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,313
He of ten spoke of you. He loves you,
like you were his own son.

632
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:28,615
...the greatest minister that he ever had,
but that someday I would leave him...

633
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,190
...and turn against him,
and so I was dangerous.

634
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,907
While praising me to my face...

635
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,036
And he said that about me?

636
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,246
...he was tearing me apart behind my back.

637
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,659
- You're absolutely sure about all this?
- Yes, I am, Brother Minister.

638
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,039
All I want is support
for my three children...

639
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:49,374
...that The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them. That's all I want.

640
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,969
Allah will provide.

641
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,137
For all of us.

642
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,473
What are you talkin' about, "blackout"?

643
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:04,068
Perhaps some of the brothers
are a little jealous.

644
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,896
Maybe they think you've been gettin'
too much press. It's nothing. Forget it.

645
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,944
Now, about our coming up
in the world a little.

646
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,822
The Nation's grown, we've grown with it.

647
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,030
You know our people.

648
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,875
They want their leaders to be prosperous.

649
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,037
One hand washes the other.

650
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:28,628
"I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

651
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,426
Remember, Brother Baines?
That's what you told me in prison.

652
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,463
"I'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

653
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,559
Brother Malcolm...

654
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,192
...what do you want? A new car?

655
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,816
A new house?

656
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,650
It's the money, isn't it?

657
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,951
How do we tell the whole world
that we're moral leaders...

658
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:04,575
...because we follow the personal example
of The Honourable Elijah Muhammad?

659
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,041
Elijah Muhammad is a human being.
And so are you.

660
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,968
- Do you know your Bible?
- Do you know yours?

661
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:17,510
David slept with Bathsheba,
but he is remembered for slaying Goliath.

662
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:23,309
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

663
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:28,309
Solomon had 700 wives, but he was
the greatest, wisest king in history.

664
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:32,234
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

665
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,359
The deeds of a great man
far outweigh his weaknesses.

666
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,859
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

667
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,868
- Baines, I'm not gonna lie...
- Be careful, Malcolm.

668
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,077
I warn you.

669
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,208
You be careful.

670
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,395
(door opens)

671
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,273
(door closes)

672
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,816
I'm not surprised.

673
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,658
You have a very good understanding
of prophecy, of spiritual matters.

674
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,993
I'm not surprised.

675
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,084
I have built this Nation...

676
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,709
...under the divine guidance of Allah.

677
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,633
He has brought me back from the dead
to lead my people.

678
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,049
After me, there will be no more.

679
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,266
No more.

680
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,474
(clock ticks)

681
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,349
I must...

682
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:55,111
...plant my seed in fertile soil.

683
00:42:55,323 --> 00:43:00,483
It is only the fulfilment of prophecy.

684
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,955
My faith had been shattered
in a way I can never fully describe.

685
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,746
Every second of my 12 years
with Mr Muhammad...

686
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,409
...I had been ready
to lay down my life for him.

687
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,454
The thing to me
that is worse than death itself is betrayal.

688
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,630
You see, I could conceive death,
but I couldn 't conceive betrayal.

689
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:23,182
Not of the loyalty which I had given
to the Nation oflslam and Mr Muhammad.

690
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,846
During the previous 12 years, had he
committed a crime punishable by death...

691
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:32,150
...I would have said and tried to prove
that I did it, to save him...

692
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:35,686
...and gladly gone to the electric chair
in Mr Muhammad's place.

693
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,738
* Ray Charles: Up in the mornin '

694
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,865
(footsteps)

695
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,409
* Out on the job

696
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:51,497
- * (gospel choir) Oh...
- * I work like the devil for my pay...

697
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,044
What did he say?

698
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:59,968
* I know that the lucky old sun...

699
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,803
- I'm so sorry.
- No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

700
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,687
I just got a lot of work to do, that's all.

701
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,902
- How can you work?
- Well, because we have to teach.

702
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:20,696
We got to teach the people, we got to
teach on Solomon and Moses, David...

703
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,990
Solomon had 700 wives.

704
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,576
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his...

705
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,578
(chuckles)
My father used to say that, uh...

706
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,752
...you can't make a rooster stop crowing
once the sun has come up.

707
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,293
Well, the sun is up.

708
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,298
* I know that lucky old sun

709
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,012
* Has nothin' to do

710
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,558
* But roll around heaven all day

711
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,858
- * Oh...
- * Dear Lord... *

712
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,780
So what do I say
about this national day of mourning...

713
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,237
...so-called national day of mourning?

714
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,614
I say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned...

715
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,945
...not only by our beliefs, but by his own.

716
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:12,000
The holy Koran teaches us
that those who work evil...

717
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:16,996
...will be condemned, or punished,
or judged, according to their works.

718
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:22,084
The holy Bible teaches us that you reap
what you sow. This is divine justice.

719
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:26,092
In the soil of the Americas, the white man
has planted the seeds of hatred.

720
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,174
He's planted the seeds of violence.

721
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,474
He's allowed those weeds to grow up...

722
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,179
...and choke the lives out of millions
of black men and women for 400 years.

723
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:38,852
In fact, the lives of Indians
in these Americas for the last 500 years.

724
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,569
And now those same weeds...

725
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,691
...have choked one of his own gardeners,
in fact, his chief gardener...

726
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,152
...and you ask me what I say.
I only say what the Bible says.

727
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,949
I say what the Koran says.

728
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,698
I say it's justice.

729
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,831
- (cheering and applause)
- As salaam alaikum.

730
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,793
(crowd shouts)

731
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,880
Minister X, don't you even feel
a little bit of remorse...

732
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,587
...saddened by
President Kennedy's assassination?

733
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,761
Sir, I don't think
anybody here would deny...

734
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,886
...that when you send your chickens out
in the morning from your barnyard...

735
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:11,473
...the chickens will return that evening
to your barnyard, not your neighbour's.

736
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:15,143
This is a prime example of the devil's
chickens coming back home to roost.

737
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,150
That the chickens that he's sent out...

738
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,226
...the violence he's perpetrated
here and abroad...

739
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,694
...be it four children in Birmingham...

740
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,818
...or Medgar Evers,
or Lumumba overin Africa.

741
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,231
I think this same violence
has come back to claim one of their own.

742
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,867
Now, being an old farm boy myself...

743
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,193
...chickens coming home to roost
nevermade me sad.

744
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,905
- In fact, it's only made me glad.
- (reporters shout)

745
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,953
(coughs)

746
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,128
(sniffs and gasps)

747
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,754
Did you...

748
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,131
...read the paper today?

749
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,387
Yes, sir, I did.

750
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,768
That...

751
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,808
...was a bad statement you made.

752
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,025
You knew from my instructions...

753
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:09,238
...no Minister was to make
any statements against this man.

754
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,865
The country loved this man.

755
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,446
You have made it...

756
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,411
...hard for Muslims...

757
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,335
...(coughs) in general.

758
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,414
(coughs)

759
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,546
Yes, sir.

760
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:30,886
We must dissociate ourselves
from your terrible blunder.

761
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,010
I must silence you.

762
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,929
For 90 days...

763
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:45,728
...you must not make
any statements to the press...

764
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:50,943
...nor are you to speak at any temples.

765
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,242
Yes, sir.

766
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,868
Yes, sir. I submit 100 per cent.

767
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,045
(phlegmy cough)

768
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:12,133
(coughs painfully)

769
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,396
(coughing continues)

770
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,942
(laboured coughing)

771
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,282
(telephone rings)

772
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,874
(child babbles happily)

773
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,384
You leave us alone.

774
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,850
- Betty?
- Leave us alone. Stop calling here.

775
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,853
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

776
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,184
Stop it! Stop...

777
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,985
Hello?

778
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:22,746
- (whispers) It's all right. It's OK.
- They keep calling.

779
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,166
- They keep calling...
- Shhhh.

780
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,759
(whispers) Shh. Now, just, uh...

781
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:33,678
We'll take the babies, put them into bed.

782
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:35,886
C'mon, babies, let's go to bed now.

783
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,891
- C'mon. Come on.
- Bedtime.

784
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,016
Let's go.

785
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,804
- Good night, Mommy, good night, Daddy.
- There you go. Night-night.

786
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,022
- Good night, Sidney.
- Night-night!

787
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,276
- Come on.
- Good night.

788
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:03,540
Brother Minister, I have to level with you.

789
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,750
They gave me a mission.
But I couldn't do it.

790
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:11,375
- I love y'all.
- What kind of mission?

791
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,343
To wire your car...

792
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,475
...so it would explode
when you turned the ignition.

793
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:27,191
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr Muhammad.

794
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:31,687
The ministers say that you are
the greatest hypocrite, a... a Judas.

795
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,318
A Benedict Arnold.

796
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:39,235
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out...

797
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,787
...and delivered
to Mr Muhammad's doorstep.

798
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:47,159
- And what do you say?
- I'm with you, Brother Minister.

799
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:51,086
- You'll be marked for death.
- Yes, sir.

800
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,716
Let me die, then.

801
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,849
(sighs)

802
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:08,436
Brother, I can't come between you
and your father.

803
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,849
- You're my father.
- Brother, go on home.

804
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,239
Don't come back. That's an order.

805
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,162
Yes, sir.
