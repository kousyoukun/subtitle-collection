01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:11,214
I told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

1098
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,425
They let us sing and dance
and smile...

1099
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,929
...and then they let one
so-called Negro into the majors.

1100
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,723
That doesn't cancel out history's
greatest crime.

1101
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:24,018
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains...

1102
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,438
...one hundred million of us,
broke up our families...

1103
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,065
...tortured us...

1104
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:33,110
...cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history.

1105
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,198
Let me tell you about black history.

1106
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:39,992
We are the original man.

1107
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,287
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled.

1108
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,290
And there wasn't
a white face anywhere.

1109
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:49,126
But they teach us
that we swung from trees.

1110
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,630
That's a lie.
Black men never did that.

1111
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:55,424
We were a race of kings
when the white man...

1112
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,718
...crawled on all fours in Europe.

1113
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,971
Do they know who they are?

1114
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,809
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

1115
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:06,894
-Malcolm Little.
-No.

1116
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,314
That's the name of the slave masters
that owned your family.

1117
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,109
You don't even know who you are.

1118
01:16:13,318 --> 01:16:15,945
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.

1119
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,655
Who are you?

1120
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,369
Look, I ain't-- Shit, heh.

1121
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:30,501
All right, I ain't Malcolm Little,
or Red, or Satan.

1122
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,253
That's right. So who are you?

1123
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:39,218
-I don't know.
BAINES: We are a nation...

1124
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,512
...the tribe of Shabazz...

1125
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:45,349
...lost in this wilderness called
North America.

1126
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,358
Tribe of Shabazz.

1127
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,986
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

1128
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:59,447
...a black man
named Elijah Muhammad.

1129
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:03,409
He reveals to us the true
knowledge about ourselves.

1130
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:07,705
He teaches that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

1131
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:09,540
...is righteousness.

1132
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,376
If the black man's nature
is righteousness....

1133
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:15,338
Then the true nature of
the white man is wickedness.

1134
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,089
I knew you'd get it.

1135
01:17:17,382 --> 01:17:21,218
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
that the white man is a devil.

1136
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,888
I sure met some in my life.

1137
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:25,723
No.

1138
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:30,102
Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

1139
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:33,939
He teaches us that
all white men are devils.

1140
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:38,736
Have you ever known a good white man?
Think back in all your life.

1141
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,239
Have you ever met one
who wasn't evil?

1142
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,041
BAINES:
The body is a sacred temple...

1143
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,502
...it must be purified.

1144
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,923
I will not touch
the white man's poison:

1145
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,508
His drugs...

1146
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,426
...his liquor...

1147
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,596
...his swine...

1148
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:06,931
...his women.

1149
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,434
A Muslim must be strikingly upright...

1150
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,436
...an outstanding example...

1151
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:16,107
...so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

1152
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:21,487
I will not commit adultery or fornication.

1153
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,740
I will not lie...

1154
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,659
...cheat or steal.

1155
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:30,454
But the key to Islam is submission.

1156
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:38,462
That is why five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

1157
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,173
...to bend our knees in submission.

1158
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,138
I can't do that, Brother Baines.

1159
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,932
The lost, found,
must bend their knees...

1160
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,642
...to admit their guilt.

1161
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:56,522
To implore Allah's forgiveness
is the hardest thing on earth.

1162
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,822
The hardest and the greatest.

1163
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,496
I don't know
what I would say to Allah.

1164
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:15,499
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?

1165
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:20,337
Yes, when I was, uh...

1166
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,883
When I was picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

1167
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,135
Tell Allah that.

1168
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,025
You can grovel and crawl for sin
but not to save your soul?

1169
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,235
Pick the lock, Malcolm. Pick it.

1170
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,529
I want to.

1171
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,160
God knows I want to.

1172
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,883
MALCOLM: I received a letter that day
from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1173
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,385
The dear Holy Apostle wrote to me...

1174
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:11,388
...a nobody, a junkie,
a pimp and a convict.

1175
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,558
MUHAMMAD:
I have come to give you...

1176
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:18,687
...something which can
never be taken away from you.

1177
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:23,859
I bring to you
a sense of your own worth...

1178
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:27,446
...the worth of one human being.

1179
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,157
The knowledge of self.

1180
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,826
MALCOLM:
It was like a blinding light.

1181
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,662
I became aware
that he was in the room with me.

1182
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:38,165
He wore a dark suit,
and on his face I saw a wisdom...

1183
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,044
...and pain so old and deep
that I could scarcely look at him.

1184
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:45,798
But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was there with me.

1185
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,883
I tell you...

1186
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,596
...the most dangerous creation
in the world...

1187
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,224
...in any society...

1188
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,394
...is the man with nothing to lose.

1189
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:03,566
You do not need 1 0 such men
to change the world.

1190
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,443
One will do.

1191
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,447
The earth belongs to us...

1192
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,074
...the black man.

1193
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,785
And whatever is around it...

1194
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,955
...or on it, or in it...

1195
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,291
...belongs to us.

1196
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,626
MALCOLM:
And then as suddenly as he came...

1197
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:23,961
...he was gone.

1198
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,673
And then I could do it.

1199
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,886
We're taught that Paul...

1200
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:35,472
...on the road to Damascus,
heard the voice of Christ.

1201
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,684
He was so smitten by the truth
that he fell from his horse.

1202
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,061
Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...

1203
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,980
...but I do understand.

1204
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,150
You see, it happened to me.

1205
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,443
Why me?

1206
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,908
BAINES: Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back
in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.

1207
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,453
We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.

1208
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:01,540
My wife and my son join me in saying
that when you come out...

1209
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,084
...which won't be long,
come straight to us.

1210
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:05,669
GUARD:
Next.

1211
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,093
What'll it be, Little?

1212
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,180
Take it all off.

1213
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,849
-Getting rid of that conk, huh?
-Yes, sir.

1214
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,187
BAINES:
You write, thanking me. Ha-ha-ha.

1215
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:27,608
Don't thank me, thank Allah.
He did it all.

1216
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,946
MALCOLM:
Dear Brother Baines:

1217
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:35,866
Please thank the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad for the money...

1218
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,369
...and tell him I haven't written him...

1219
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:40,537
...because I've not yet proven myself.

1220
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:44,959
But I have shared his teachings
with some old running buddies in Harlem...

1221
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:48,587
...and with my main man, Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.

1222
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,047
He's gone nuts.

1223
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,715
"Dear Brothers:

1224
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,635
I thank you for your time and concern.

1225
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:59,473
All praises due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1226
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,518
I wrote the mayor, the governor
and the president...

1227
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:06,021
...but for some reason,
I haven't heard from them."

1228
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,231
Hmm.

1229
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,441
MALCOLM: Please tell
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1230
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:13,737
...that I have dedicated my life to telling
the white devil the truth to his face.

1231
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:18,033
I greet you with the ancient words
of peace, "As-Salaam-Alaikum. "

1232
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:21,870
P.S. I finally copied out
the entire dictionary.

1233
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:26,583
I think the brother is coming along.

1234
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,964
"The thief cometh not but for to steal...

1235
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,926
...and to kill, and to destroy.

1236
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:37,928
But I am come...

1237
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,222
...that they might have life...

1238
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,476
...and that they might have it
more abundantly."

1239
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,773
Saint John 10, verse 10.
Are there any questions?

1240
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,822
Watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

1241
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:01,994
I see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

1242
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,495
"Satan" has a question.

1243
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:04,705
[LAUGHS]

1244
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,207
Yes, sir. But since neither of us are God...

1245
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,502
...neither of us can say
who's good and who's evil.

1246
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:11,962
Just ask your question.

1247
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,799
We were discussing the Disciples.
What color were they?

1248
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,510
Well, I don't think...

1249
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,304
...we know for certain.

1250
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:22,598
-But they were Hebrews?
-That's right.

1251
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,850
As was Jesus.
Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1252
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,603
Just ask your question.

1253

What color were the Hebrews?

01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,900
I have told you that
we don't know that for certain.

1255
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:37,196
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

blond hair and blue eyes.

...in prisons and churches

1263

...are not historically correct.

1264

Because history teaches us...

1265
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,431
...Jesus was born in a region where
the people had color.

When God spoke to the devil about

...that tell us we ought to pray
for our enemies.

1865
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:54,055

and shoots us, who lynches us...

That's not intelligent.

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to teach you and I...

1872
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:13,908
...that just as the white man
and any other man on this earth...

1873
02:02:14,076 --> 02:02:17,537
...has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

1874
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:20,665
...the natural right, and any other
rights you can think of...

...to protect himself...

...just as this white man has
the right to defend himself...

1877
02:02:26,672 --> 02:02:29,424
...we have the right
to defend ourselves too.

1878
02:02:29,967 --> 02:02:31,259
This is only natural.

1879
02:02:31,427 --> 02:02:34,346
This is what the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad is trying to teach you and I.

1880
02:02:34,555 --> 02:02:36,556
He's not teaching us
to hate the white man.

1881
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:39,267
He's teaching us to love ourselves.

HOST: Mr. X, uh, before we begin
our discussion tonight...

1883
02:02:44,648 --> 02:02:47,984
..."The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...

1884
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:52,280
...would you mind explaining for us
the meaning of your name...

1885
02:02:52,448 --> 02:02:54,616
...which is the letter "X"?

1886
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:58,411
Yes, uh, during slavery time,
the slave master...

1887
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:01,122
...gave the Negro-- So-called Negro--

1888
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:04,501
Named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

1889

The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1890
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:11,257
...that once we come into the knowledge
of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves...

1891
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:14,094
...we replace our slave name
with an "X"...

1892
02:03:14,303 --> 02:03:17,180
..."X" in mathematics representing
the unknown.

1893
02:03:17,473 --> 02:03:20,558

or cut off from our own history...

He's a demagogue.

...why do you teach black supremacy?

1904

Why--? Why do you teach hate?

1905

Well, for the white man...

1906
02:03:54,677 --> 02:03:57,178
...to ask the black man...

1907
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,097
...why he hates him...

1908
02:03:59,348 --> 02:04:03,226
...is like the wolf asking the sheep,
or the rapist asking the raped...

1909

..."Do you hate me?"

1910
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:08,314
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

1911
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:10,483
PAYSON:
This is a black man asking the question.

1912
02:04:10,693 --> 02:04:14,863
What would you call an educated Negro
with a B.A., an M.A., a B.S. or a Ph.D.?

1913
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:18,533
You call him a nigger.
That's what the white man calls him.

1914
02:04:18,701 --> 02:04:20,910
You have to understand this thinking.

1915
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,747
To understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

1916
02:04:24,957 --> 02:04:28,626
...there were two types of slaves:
the house Negro and the field Negro.

1917
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:30,628
The house Negro lived in the house...

1918
02:04:30,838 --> 02:04:34,507
...next to his master, in the big house,
in the basement or the attic.

1919
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:37,469
He dressed good, he ate good,
what the master left him.

1920
02:04:37,678 --> 02:04:39,304
He loved his master.

1921
02:04:39,513 --> 02:04:42,724
He loved his master better
than the master loved himself.

1922
02:04:42,892 --> 02:04:47,228
If master said, "We got a nice house,"
you say, "Yeah, boss, we got a nice house."

1923
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:49,981
Master's house caught on fire,
the house Negro...

1924
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,691
...would put the blaze out.

1925
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:55,445
If the master got sick, he'd say,
"What's the matter, boss? We sick?"

1926
02:04:55,613 --> 02:04:58,281
"We sick"!
This is the thinking of the house Negro.

1927
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:00,074
If another slave said to him:

1928
02:05:00,242 --> 02:05:03,286
"Let's run away, let's separate
from this cruel master"...

1929
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:06,414
...he said, "Why? What's better
than what we got here?

1930
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:08,958
I'm not going anywhere."
This is the house Negro.

1931
02:05:09,126 --> 02:05:11,127
In those days,
we called them house niggers.

1932
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:15,381
That's what we call them today
because we still got a lot of house niggers.

BAINES:
Dear Holy Apostle...

...the ministers think Malcolm
is getting too much press.

1935
02:05:23,891 --> 02:05:26,518
They think he thinks
he is the Nation of Islam.

1936
02:05:28,395 --> 02:05:31,064
That he has aspirations
to lead the Nation.

the man he is.

He's trying to get us on God's side...

Then he'd want to get off welfare.
He'd want a job...

1992

...to take care of his family.
And his family would respect him.

1993

His son will say,
"I'm proud that that's my father."

His wife will say,
"I'm proud that that's my husband."

1995
02:08:32,705 --> 02:08:37,333
"Father" only means that you're taking care
of your children. That's what it is.

1996
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:40,545
"Father" doesn't mean
that you're having some babies.

1997
02:08:40,754 --> 02:08:44,298
That doesn't make you a father.
Anybody can go out and get a woman.

But not anybody can take care

But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy.

-I love you all.
-What kind of mission?

2333
02:31:04,722 --> 02:31:06,681
To wire your car...

2334

...when you turned the ignition.

2336
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:17,233
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

2337

They say that
you're the greatest hypocrite...

...and delivered
to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

2342

Yes, sir.

explosive year on the racial front...

2353
02:32:31,684 --> 02:32:36,312
... I have called this press conference
to clarify my position in that struggle.

2354
02:32:36,605 --> 02:32:40,567
Internal differences within the Nation
of Islam have forced me out of it.

2355
02:32:40,734 --> 02:32:44,779
In the past, I thought and spoke the words
of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2356
02:32:44,989 --> 02:32:46,906
Everything I said, I started with:

2357
02:32:47,074 --> 02:32:50,410
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us" thus-and-so.

That day is over.

2359
02:32:52,496 --> 02:32:56,207
From now on I speak my own words,
and I think my own thoughts.

2360
02:32:56,417 --> 02:32:59,127
Now that I have more,
uh, independence of action...

2361
02:32:59,336 --> 02:33:02,755
...I'll use a more flexible approach
in working with others...

bad things I said about them.

solution to a common problem.

of our community.
