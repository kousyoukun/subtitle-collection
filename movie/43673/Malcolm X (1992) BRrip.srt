1
00:00:01,248 --> 00:00:03,045
In the name of Allah, the merciful.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,810
All praises due to Allah,
Lord of all worlds.

3
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:07,986
The one God to whom praise
is due forever.

4
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:10,952
The one who came to us in the person
of Fard Muhammad...

5
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:14,684
...and raised up the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad. Amen.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,091
How do you feel?

7
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:21,730
-Who do we want to hear?
-Malcolm X!

8
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:24,028
Are we gonna bring him on?

9
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,034
Yes, we gonna bring him on.

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,969
Let us hear from our minister,
Mr. Malcolm X!

11
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:32,406
Let us bring him on with
a round of applause.

12
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:42,852
I'm here to tell you that
I charge the white man.

13
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:46,787
I charge the white man with being
the greatest murderer on earth.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,224
I charge the white man with being
the greatest kidnapper on earth.

15
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:54,729
There's no place in this world that
that man can go...

16
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,401
...and say he created peace
and harmony. Everywhere he's gone...

17
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:00,069
...he's created havoc.

18
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:03,299
Everywhere he's gone,
he's created destruction.

19
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:07,741
So I charge him with being
the greatest kidnapper on this earth!

20
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,075
I charge him with being the greatest
murderer on this earth!

21
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:15,584
I charge him with being the greatest
robber and enslaver on this earth!

22
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:17,517
I charge the white man...

23
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:22,161
...with being the greatest swine-eater
and drunkard on this earth!

24
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,522
He can't deny the charges.

25
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:28,827
You can't deny the charges!
We're the living proof of those charges!

26
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:31,127
You and I are the proof.

27
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:35,269
You're not an American.
You are the victim ofAmerica!

28
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:38,341
You didn't have a choice coming here.
He didn't say:

29
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:42,343
"Black man, black woman, come over
and help me build America. "

30
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,846
He said, "Nigger, get in the boat.

31
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,451
I'm taking you over there to help me
build America. "

32
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,353
Being born here
does not make you an American.

33
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:57,427
You and I are not American. You're one
of the 22 million black people...

34
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:03,100
...who are victims ofAmerica.
You and I, we've never seen democracy.

35
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,034
There's no democracy in the fields
of Georgia. No democracy down there.

36
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:13,812
We didn't see any democracy in Harlem,
Brooklyn, Detroit, Chicago.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,345
Ain't no democracy there.
We've never seen democracy.

38
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:20,877
All we've seen is hypocrisy.

39
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,550
We don't see any American dream.

40
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:28,385
We've experienced only
the American nightmare.

41
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,891
See that spot?
Get it. The spot!

42
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,284
All right, that's it.

43
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,395
Hey, Cholly!

44
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:21,370
Where'd you get that number you hit on?
Was it your girl's address?

45
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:25,738
No, my grandma gave me that number
in my dreams. Straight!

46
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:27,480
3-8-4.

47
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,580
You said Sassy Frassy gave you--

48
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:30,977
That woman quit me.

49
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:35,177
After l hit the number, that woman
was no good to me at all.

50
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:39,723
She said l was cheap because
l wouldn't cop her a diamond ring.

51
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:44,153
And on top of that,
had the indignation...

52
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:47,333
...to call me, of all people,
Good-time Cholly...

53
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,360
...a cheap, black son of a bitch.

54
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:52,436
Where's homeboy?

55
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,529
Hey, Little.

56
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,138
Your man out here waiting on you.

57
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,370
There he is.

58
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,810
Fixing to get that first conk laid on?

59
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,085
Be hot like hell.

60
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,379
Don't be scared, son.

61
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:11,284
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

62
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:14,085
You in the hands of an expert.

63
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:18,162
My hair was just like yours.
Look what he did for me.

64
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:20,796
Heckle and Jeckle...

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,798
...don't scare the man no more than
he's scared already.

66
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:27,106
-Get his forehead and eyebrows.
-Who's doing this?

67
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,604
You all heard that!

68
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:33,969
Pull my coat if it stings. This shit
can burn a hole through cement.

69
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,169
Hold tight.

70
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,244
l thought you said
this would sting, Shorty.

71
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,277
This ain't nothing.

72
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,317
-Feel good, don't it?
-Real good?

73
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,989
Yeah, it's all right.

74
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,418
You'll feel better.

75
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,786
lt is heating up a bit.

76
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:49,986
lt's starting to heat up.

77
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,128
lt's okay.

78
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,798
Feeling better, ain't it?

79
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,593
-Just hold on.
-l'm holding, but it's heating.

80
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,770
Gotta make it straight.

81
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,196
That's what he told me too.

82
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,934
l gotta get this out now.
lt's starting--

83
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:08,404
-Hold on.
-l'm holding, l'm holding.

84
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:11,915
Give me a hand!

85
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,380
Help me out! Hold him!

86
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,049
We're going to the sink!

87
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,019
l got to get up! l got to get up!

88
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:19,691
-Cool it!
-Put water on it!

89
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:20,860
More water!

90
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,119
You're getting it in my eye!

91
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:26,526
-How's it feel?
-Like there's no skin on my head!

92
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,961
lf you can talk, it's out.

93
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,601
-How does it look?
-Can't tell yet.

94
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:33,465
ls it straight?
l'm not doing it again.

95
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,738
Let me dry it.

96
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:40,138
l can tell it's laying down.

97
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:45,140
Don't take it off yet.

98
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,731
Looks white, don't it?

99
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:03,994
All right!

100
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:06,400
Well, all root!

101
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:07,630
All reet!

102
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,350
Hit the brim with the left.

103
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,280
When my mother was pregnant with me...

104
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:55,313
...a party of Klansmen surrounded
our house in Omaha, Nebraska.

105
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:59,218
They brandished guns and shouted
for my father to come out.

106
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,692
My pregnant mother went to the door...

107
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:07,889
...and said that my father was in
Milwaukee, preaching.

108
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,767
They said that good white Christians...

109
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,599
...would not stand for his
troublemaking and to get out of town.

110
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:36,627
They broke every window with
their rifles before riding away.

111
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:42,525
They rode off into the moonlight as
suddenly as they had come.

112
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:48,497
My father was not a frightened Negro,
as most were and many still are today.

113
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,006
He was 6 feet 4 and very strong.

114
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,075
He believed, as did Marcus Garvey...

115
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,679
...that freedom, independence
and self-respect...

116
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,577
...wouldn't be achieved
by Negroes in America.

117
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:02,721
--the object of building up for
themselves a great nation in Africa.

118
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,246
Therefore...

119
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:08,120
...black men should leave America and
return to their land of origin.

120
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,691
My father dedicated his life
to his beliefs...

121
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,663
...because four of his six brothers
died violently.

122
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:18,803
Three killed by white men,
and one lynched.

123
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,302
There were nine children in our family.

124
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:25,469
My mother was a proud woman, an
educated woman, a strong woman.

125
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,606
She was fair-skinned because her mother
was raped by a white man.

126
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:34,480
One reason she married my father was
because he was so black.

127
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:39,120
She hated her complexion and wanted
her children to have some color.

128
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:44,490
I think this had a profound effect on
me then and on most Negroes today.

129
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:49,795
Because so many of our sisters have been
raped or violated by the white man...

130
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:53,904
...black men can't wait to get their
hands on the white man's prize:

131
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,768
A white woman.

132
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,771
Africa for the Africans!

133
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,005
Say "Roseland."

134
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,414
Showtime!

135
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,185
Showtime!

136
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:41,880
Hi, Shorty!

137
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,548
You're too big!

138
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,054
l'm gonna come get you.

139
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:55,391
Come on, Shorty,
l've gotta dance!

140
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,872
You in charge, boy!

141
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,581
You like what you see, baby?

142
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:16,485
Get back here!

143
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:17,781
Go ahead, boy!

144
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,685
Red, save me! Save me!

145
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:20,722
Gotcha!

146
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,106
Come on, Shorty. l wanna dance again!

147
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:41,525
Laura sure can go, can't she?

148
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,759
-l gotta go freshen up.
-All right.

149
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:46,301
-You come on back now.
-All right, Malcolm.

150
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:49,734
That chick is fine as May wine.

151
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,376
Except she lives up on a hill
and got a grandmother too.

152
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,742
She a church girl.
l don't know what l'm gonna do.

153
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,662
Wanna dance?

154
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,164
So what do they call you?

155
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,289
Red.

156
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,004
l'm Sophia.

157
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,698
How you doing?

158
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:57,739
Very well, thank you.

159
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,104
l have an idea, Red.

160
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:06,008
Why don't you take that
little girl home and come on back?

161
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:15,986
Just walk, baby, don't run.

162
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,797
lt'll be here when you get back.

163
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:37,315
Well, l better not come in.

164
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,108
l'm not stupid.

165
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,175
lt's late, baby.

166
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,413
l know where you're going.
l am not a total square.

167
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:47,990
-l know what's happening--
-l gotta go home. lt's late.

168
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:52,028
l gotta get up early in the morning.
l gotta work tomorrow.

169
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,367
l'll call you tomorrow?

170
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,127
What for?

171
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:03,034
l'm not white and l don't put out,
so why would you want to call me?

172
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,976
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.
l'll call you tomorrow.

173
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:06,093
Am l the first white woman
you've been with?

174
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,538
No, you ain't.

175
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,036
Shit, l done had plenty.

176
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:15,537
That isn't a whore?

177
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:34,656
Take your time.

178
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:38,394
Sophia's not going anywhere.

179
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:40,971
l told you to walk...

180
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:42,906
...don't run.

181
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,139
l don't like women that talk too much.

182
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:54,209
Who wants to talk?

183
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,967
You missed me.

184
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,108
Try this on for size.

185
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:22,840
-l ducked.
-You ducked?

186
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,312
You didn't! l got you
right between the toes!

187
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:28,975
l'm tired of playing the cops.
l wanna be Bogart.

188
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:32,055
Shorty, you're too small to be Bogart.

189
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:33,918
l'm not too short to be Cagney.

190
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:39,363
One more!

191
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:47,363
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

192
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,213
You used to be a big shot.

193
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,346
There is just nothing l can do.

194
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:05,785
-What do you mean, took his own life?
-You heard the verdict.

195
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:10,792
Verdict? A man takes a hammer and
bashes in the back of his own head?

196
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:13,362
Then he lays on the tracks
and kills himself?

197
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,197
We only act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

198
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,302
Do you pay or don't you?

199
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:24,808
Read the policy, ma'am.

200
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,169
lt clearly states....

201
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,612
Come here, Sophia.

202
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,258
You're the man.

203
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:52,702
Sit down.

204
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,504
What's your story?

205
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:03,944
You one of them white chicks
can't get enough colored studs?

206
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:16,354
lKiss my foot.

207
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:20,728
Go ahead, kiss it.

208
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:31,602
Now feed me.

209
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,262
That's your story, girl.

210
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,658
So when you gonna holler rape?

211
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:57,865
Me?

212
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,630
Yes, you.
You would, if the time came.

213
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,101
Sure you would.

214
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:04,638
Malcolm, let me feed you.

215
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:06,667
Come on.

216
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:09,242
While they're hot.

217
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:20,217
l wish your mother and father
could see you now.

218
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,985
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

219
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:25,254
l sure wish Laura could see us.

220
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:17,811
Please, Malcolm.

221
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,778
There's nobody around.

222
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:23,984
No, this ain't right.

223
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,654
-Why?
-Because you--

224
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,852
No, it's because of
the white girl, isn't it?

225
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:35,523
-lt's not because of that.
-Folks say you run around with her.

226
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:39,534
Save it for Mr. Right. Your
grandmother's smarter than you think.

227
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,666
l'm sorry she raised me that way.

228
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,417
ls your mother alive?

229
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:54,641
Yes, she's alive.

230
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:59,157
When l was a kid, l was so poor
l thought "not for sale" ...

231
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:01,519
...was a brand name.

232
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,092
l did knock.

233
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:04,762
Did you hear me say, "Come in"?

234
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,127
There's no point in fighting about it.
l'm sorry.

235
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:12,370
-May l sit down?
-You're nice enough to ask.

236
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,332
lt's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

237
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:22,141
-Since your husband's death...
-Murder. Murder.

238
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:26,951
...there's a question as to whether you
can raise these children alone.

239
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:30,412
These are my children.

240
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:33,785
They're mine.

241
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,452
And they ain't no question.

242
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:41,599
Sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor
is the only kindness.

243
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,965
All your children are delinquent...

244
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,297
...and one at least,
Malcolm, is a thief.

245
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:48,165
Get out!

246
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:51,865
Your control over your
children is nonexistent.

247
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:53,544
Did you hear me?

248
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:57,543
You will regret this.

249
00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:02,015
lf you don't move through that door,
you'll be past regretting!

250
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,248
We were parceled out, all of us.

251
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:12,830
I truly believe that if ever
a state agency destroyed a family...

252
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,530
...it destroyed ours.

253
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,037
I was sent to a detention
home and lived at this woman's house.

254
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:21,738
Mrs. Swerlin.

255
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,068
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

256
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:27,172
We'll treat him like a brother.

257
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,680
I was special. The only
colored kid in the class.

258
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:35,283
I became sort of a mascot,
like a pink poodle.

259
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:39,549
I got called a nigger so much,
I didn't think it was wrong.

260
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:41,692
I thought it was my name.

261
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:45,791
They talked about me like I wasn't
there. Like a pedigreed dog...

262
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:47,431
...or a horse.

263
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,462
Like I was invisible.

264
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:53,565
The important thing
is to be realistic.

265
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,263
We all like you here, you know that.

266
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,365
But you're a nigger...

267
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,875
...and a lawyer is no realistic
goal for a nigger.

268
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,674
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

269
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,316
l gets the best grades in class.

270
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,955
l got voted class president.
l want to be a lawyer.

271
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:14,284
l want you to think about
something that you can be.

272
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:18,057
You're good with your hands,
making things.

273
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,621
People would give you work. l would.

274
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,798
Why not become a carpenter?

275
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:27,061
That's a good profession for a colored.

276
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:29,901
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

277
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:32,805
Jesus was a carpenter.

278
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:37,043
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

279
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,475
Remember what we said.

280
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,479
"Nothing succeeds like success."
Say it.

281
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:46,088
Nothing succeeds like success.

282
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,191
As long as you're realistic.

283
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,122
lt's not the end of the world.

284
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,756
l said, "Don't...

285
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
...let them give that boy no pig."

286
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,367
It wasn't the end
of the world for me.

287
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,904
But it was the beginning of the end
for my mother.

288
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,514
A right cross to thejaw by Louis.

289
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:17,084
Louis takes Conn's head back
with a right uppercut.

290
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,916
Louis hits left and right.

291
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:22,616
And Conn is down
with a right cross to thejaw!

292
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,419
He's taking the count.

293
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:27,291
Four, five, six...

294
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:31,196
...seven. He's on his back.
Eight. Nine.

295
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,338
He's getting up!
The referee says it's all over!

296
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:41,276
What in hell is going on?

297
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:42,476
Nothing, Mr. Cooper.

298
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,148
The customer's are hungry.

299
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,116
Soup done finished, Mr. Cooper.

300
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:48,047
Right, Mr. Charlie.

301
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:50,018
The name is Mr. Cooper.

302
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:51,881
Don't you forget it.

303
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,353
Mr. Cooper.

304
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:00,063
What's the matter with you?
You want me to get fired!

305
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:01,527
l got a wife and six kids!

306
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,133
Mr. Cooper is good white folk!

307
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,770
You is a young fool!

308
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:18,009
There'll never be another one like that!

309
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:20,577
He's done it!

310
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:23,117
And by a knockout...

311
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:26,848
...and still the world's
heavyweight champion:

312
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,253
Joe Louis!

313
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,224
Ham and cheese!
Excuse me, sir.

314
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:34,193
Ham and cheese here! l got coffee.

315
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,027
-Lemon meringue pie.
-Hey, boy!

316
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:40,635
-Ham and cheese.
-Yes, sir. Best in the house.

317
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,603
-You're pleased with yourself.
-l aims to please, sir.

318
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:44,934
l'm pleased to aim.

319
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:46,701
-l like you, boy.
-Thank you.

320
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,579
lKeep the change.

321
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,115
Right, sir!
Ham and cheese!

322
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:03,124
Harlem!

323
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,747
And here's Joe Lewis,
back in Harlem.

324
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,447
They're celebrating!
They're going crazy!

325
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:33,852
They're dancing! They're hanging
from street signs!

326
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:35,788
Everybody's out!

327
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:39,187
Everyone's having a great time!
Listen to them roar!

328
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,600
Joe's a credit to his race.
What a fine gentleman!

329
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,837
But he's also a fine American.

330
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,371
The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis!

331
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,104
Hey, sugar.

332
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:30,041
-Slow down. What's your hurry?
-No hurry.

333
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:31,840
Let me show you something new.

334
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,043
l got gold watches, diamond rings.

335
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,187
Any one of these. Whatever you need.

336
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:38,454
l don't need that.

337
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:41,717
You need something, baby.
Whatever you need!

338
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:43,757
A couple of these
make a player look good.

339
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:16,357
My man!

340
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:20,793
-The word is "excuse me," boy.
-"Excuse me" don't shine my shoes.

341
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,694
Then stay out of my way.

342
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,034
Old country nigger.

343
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,239
What you gonna do?

344
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,044
Go home to your mama?

345
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:55,928
Nigger, don't you ever in your life
say anything against my mother!

346
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:18,950
Give me a whiskey.

347
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,894
l ordered a single, Jack.

348
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,626
The double's on that gentleman, "Jack."

349
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:38,468
Who is that?

350
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:41,470
That's West lndian Archie.

351
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,574
What's his angle?

352
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:47,410
Some of this, some of that.

353
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:02,127
Nothing's gonna bite you.

354
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,927
You look like you're new in town.

355
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:09,265
From what l can see,
you're pretty handy with a bottle.

356
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:10,304
He had it coming.

357
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,138
Pull up a chair.

358
00:32:23,822 --> 00:32:25,289
What do they call you?

359
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:26,783
Red.

360
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:28,853
And l ain't no punk.

361
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,458
You better not be.

362
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:33,892
Any cat toe you down here,
you stand up or make tracks.

363
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:35,258
Man live by his rep.

364
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,397
Better believe it.

365
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,392
So what do you do?

366
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:40,593
Working on the train.

367
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,170
Like that job?

368
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:47,270
-lKeeps me out of the Army.
-They want you, nothing'll keep you out.

369
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,309
Not this boy.

370
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,716
So l hear tell
you're a good man to know.

371
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,942
-Where you hear that?
-Boston, where l'm from.

372
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:56,677
lKiss my neck.

373
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,579
l've never been in Beantown.

374
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,623
Like the man said, a man's rep travels.

375
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,991
How about that!

376
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:07,357
You bullshitting me?

377
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:10,591
My father told me
never bullshit a West lndian.

378
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,030
Your daddy's West lndian?

379
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:13,397
My mama.

380
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:15,835
She's from Grenada.

381
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,402
Grenada.

382
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,210
l like this guy.

383
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,547
l like your country.

384
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,647
Grenada.

385
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:29,411
Where'd you get them
goddamn vines you got on?

386
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:31,312
And them shoes?

387
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:32,453
Oh, my.

388
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,090
We can do something about that.

389
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,557
But he's putting a hurting
on my vision, man!

390
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:38,922
Relax.

391
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:40,621
How do l find you?

392
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:42,026
You can't.

393
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,199
l get ahold of you.

394
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,563
All right, l'll write it down.

395
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,602
Don't ever write anything down.

396
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,535
File it up here.

397
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,274
Like l do.

398
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:56,512
lf the man don't have any paper,
he will never have any proof.

399
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,106
Dig?

400
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:02,245
Yeah, l dig. Right.

401
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:08,351
Look me in the face.

402
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,221
Did you just con me?

403
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,223
Yes, sir.

404
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:15,530
Why?

405
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:17,257
Because l want in.

406
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,798
lt don't take a lot to know
you're already there.

407
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:22,666
At least he ain't lying.

408
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,307
l have a run to make.

409
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,841
Let me make that run
with you, Mr. Archie.

410
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:37,043
l like your heart.

411
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,817
l like your style.

412
00:34:40,758 --> 00:34:42,783
You might just do, Mr. Red.

413
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:46,191
Unless you have to
get back to your train job.

414
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,524
l've told him what to do
with that train.

415
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:49,961
-When?
-Just now.

416
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:56,601
All right.

417
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:58,502
Come with me.

418
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,606
l'm taking you shopping.

419
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:04,008
Cadillac's the name.

420
00:35:04,782 --> 00:35:06,443
Sammy, man.

421
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,316
-You ready?
-Good.

422
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,624
Button more buttons on the jacket.

423
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,927
You look good.

424
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:26,465
But you're missing something.

425
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:27,501
Frisk me.

426
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:30,106
Go ahead, frisk me.

427
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,910
Nothing, right?

428
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,352
l'm still carrying.

429
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,386
This was my first gun.

430
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,188
Now it's yours.

431
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:00,601
Thank you.

432
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:02,067
You wear it...

433
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,340
...wear it so.

434
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:07,235
Small of the back.

435
00:36:08,946 --> 00:36:10,743
Now you're outfitted.

436
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,878
Ready for the streets?

437
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:15,416
l'm ready.

438
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,118
Let them come.

439
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:22,122
Let us now turn to
the Gospel According to St. John.

440
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,655
Chapter 3...

441
00:36:23,861 --> 00:36:26,421
...verse 23.

442
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:27,761
323.

443
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:32,868
"And John also was baptizing
in Aenon near Salim...

444
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:37,604
...because there was much water.

445
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:41,910
And they came...

446
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:44,777
...and were baptized."

447
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:48,609
31 3.

448
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:51,455
255.

449
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:53,686
lt got to be 25 1 .

450
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:55,155
403.

451
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,293
l saw it in my dream.

452
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:59,929
555.

453
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,622
-What do you know?
-l feel straight.

454
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:05,032
Your lucky day.

455
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,601
Roll it for me.

456
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:10,302
l told you, no paper, no trouble.

457
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,242
l'm working on it.

458
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:15,711
l keep my numbers in my head.

459
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:19,815
l've never written a number down yet.
Remember that.

460
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:35,926
Your turn.

461
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:43,364
Easy.

462
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,239
Easy.

463
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,078
You there?

464
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:52,544
lf l ain't, l'm next door.

465
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:56,720
Nothing in this world can give you
that real deep cool.

466
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,620
The girl.

467
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:17,699
About as mellow as l can be.

468
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,239
Cool enough to kill.

469
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:25,847
l realize that.

470
00:38:28,452 --> 00:38:30,784
-Easy, easy, easy, easy.
-Stick them up.

471
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,592
Archie!

472
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,285
Baby?

473
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,194
Malcolm, you're so funny.

474
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,164
Give me some money, baby.

475
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,376
Come on, baby.

476
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,413
The bitch move too slow.

477
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:07,653
Sometimes this guy
has a big ugly mouth.

478
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,326
What time is it, baby?

479
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,452

21 8.

484
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:22,464
l'm taking the bet.

485
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:28,874
Time to reload.

486
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:19,554
l thought you said we was going
to the movies last night.

487
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:20,662
You said that.

488
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:22,866
l'm sorry. l say a lot of things.

489
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,998
l believed you.

490
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,762
Do your job now. Get me a pack
of Lucky Strikes and a cognac.

491
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:42,078
Daniel come in yet?

492
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,776
Ain't that him?

493
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:45,544
Gorgeous!

494
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:49,215
How you been today?
You been waiting long?

495
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,725
Let me look at you.

496
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:57,890
-l've been missing you today, Laura.
-How you doing, baby?

497
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:01,765
l'm all right. Copacetic. Great.
Did you work today?

498
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:04,533
No, baby, l didn't go to work.

499
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:07,711
-l need a five-spot.
-l gave you 1 0 this morning.

500
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,613
Give me the goddamn $5!

501
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:12,339
lt ain't the money.
l wanna...

502
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,142
...make sure you're okay.

503
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:16,582
l gotta pay back this guy.

504
00:41:17,254 --> 00:41:18,448
l'll be right back.

505
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,223
Like last time?

506
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:23,393
l swear, l'll be right back.

507
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,653
Laura, l love you.

508
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:35,662
You know that chick?

509
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:39,607
You a private detective now?

510
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,777
Just asking.

511
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:43,071
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

512
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,942
l ask you the questions.
You understand?

513
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,217
-She come in here a lot?
-Almost every night.

514
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,444
With him?

515
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,591
-She know he's high?
-lf she got eyes, she do.

516
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:57,885
She ain't hooking?

517
00:41:58,262 --> 00:42:00,093
Not yet, Red.

518
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:03,759
But the way things are,
he'll turn her out any day now.

519
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:10,273
You stuck on her?

520
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:14,137
That's your problem.
You need to mind your own business.

521
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:18,339
Don't do that!

522
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:21,347
l wanna talk to you, all right?
Have a seat.

523
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,724
-Don't pay him any mind, hear?
-All right.

524
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,557
-All right?
-l'm all right.

525
00:42:41,238 --> 00:42:43,331
Buy yourself something nice.

526
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:56,346
Hey, baby.

527
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,092
Give me a light.

528
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:15,901
You look uptight.
What's the problem?

529
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:17,096
-No problem.
-Sure?

530
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:20,277
Everything's all right.
l'm not worrying about it.

531
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,711
l'm thinking about my money.

532
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:27,013
Six big ones you owe me, right?

533
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:28,048
What?

534
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:29,378
821 .
lt hit, didn't it?

535
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:31,145
You didn't have 821 .

536
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:35,058
Were you high? l threw the slats
at you, told you to combinate me.

537
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:36,721
You never had it.

538
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:39,259
l tell you l did. Sophia was there.

539
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,188
You remember, don't you?

540
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:42,387
What would she say?

541
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:45,493
Don't do this.

542
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:46,727
All right?

543
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:48,469
All right.

544
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:52,136
All right, skip it.

545
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:54,001
But you're slipping, aren't you?

546
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,736
You done slipped.

547
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,475
Archie, wait.

548
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,890
Come on, Archie. Look....

549
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:18,567
Come on. You want a drink
or something? l'm buying.

550
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:20,031
l ain't drinking with you.

551
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:23,732
All right?

552
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:29,105
Come, Sam.

553
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:32,512
l'll be right there, man.

554
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:41,250
Twenty-two years.

555
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:45,087
Twenty-two years, l never
knowed him to forget a number.

556
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:46,763
First time for everything.

557
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,829
What are you talking about?

558
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:53,629
The first thing he'll do is check
with the collector for an oversight.

559
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:56,897
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

560
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:02,005
And, Red, if you're lying,
you're a dead man.

561
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:05,979
Dead, dead, dead.

562
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,442
You go and tell him that.

563
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,389
My man, Red.

564
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:20,388
Night to you.

565
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:25,065
l don't understand Archie.
You had the number.

566
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:01,363
Didn't l tell you never sit
with your back to no door?

567
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:08,604
You know what?

568
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,443
You're a damn liar.

569
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:14,013
And so is she.

570
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:19,248
So you figure to take me...

571
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:21,048
...you bastard?

572
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,154
l'm taking you.

573
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,692
-So it's you and me?
-That's right.

574
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:27,488
l'll give you the $600.

575
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:29,427
-l don't want it.
-l'm wearing.

576
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:32,761
There's three guns on you,
so you take your chances.

577
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:45,610
Let's walk.

578
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,822
So this is how l'm going out?

579
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:59,153
-ln a toe-down?
-Toe-down, yes.

580
00:47:00,197 --> 00:47:03,166
-Let's go.
-We'll let Billie finish.

581
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,411
Thank you.

582
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:53,378
Thank you very much. Thank you.

583
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:17,063
Wake up.

584
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:19,605
Wake up!

585
00:48:21,678 --> 00:48:23,236
There's somebody out there.

586
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,907
Wake the kids.

587
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:44,525
Follow me! Wait! Wait!

588
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:48,234
Go! Go!

589
00:48:51,608 --> 00:48:52,597
Careful!

590
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:59,807
-Good thing we're all good Christians.
-lt's time for you to leave this town.

591
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,143
lt's a free country.

592
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:04,843
We warned you about Garvey preaching!
Stirring up the good niggras!

593
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:06,079
l ain't a boy!

594
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,917
-l'm a man!
-You're a dead nigger.

595
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,855
And a real man don't hide
behind sheets!

596
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:13,552
You take these bullets for them sheets!

597
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:22,571
l know you're a better shot than that.

598
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:24,465
You should've killed them.

599
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:26,943
You should've shot them all dead.

600
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:28,839
l just wanted to scare them.

601
00:49:29,746 --> 00:49:32,340
They won't be around here
bothering us no more.

602
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:36,079
They won't be here no time soon.

603
00:49:36,687 --> 00:49:38,018
l'm a man!

604
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,351
That'll teach you.

605
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,629
Get a doctor!

606
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,301
He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a preacher.

607
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:55,529
l'm glad we got you out of there.

608
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:58,772
With Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire...

609
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:01,672
...Boston's the best
goddamn place for you.

610
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:04,876
We'll take it easy, huh, baby?

611
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:08,743
l got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

612
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:11,749
Sounds good. We'll lay low for a while.

613
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:15,316
Don't you worry about a thing.
l'll stake you.

614
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:18,083
l got my band. l'm blowing great sax.

615
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:20,290
You ain't even heard us play!

616
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:22,556
Like every hustler, I was trapped.

617
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,893
Cats that hung together
to find security...

618
00:50:25,102 --> 00:50:27,229
...to find an answer, found nothing.

619
00:50:27,437 --> 00:50:29,564
Cats that might've cured cancer....

620
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,640
West Indian Archie might've been
a mathematical genius.

621
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:35,835
We were all victims
of the American social order.

622
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:39,808
Until that time, there were
three things I was always afraid of:

623
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:42,952
a job, a bust andjail.

624
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:47,487
But I realized then that I wasn't
afraid of anything. I was an animal.

625
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:49,986
He don't look too good.

626
00:50:52,362 --> 00:50:54,353
We're gonna rob this town blind.

627
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,294
Anybody want out, say so now.

628
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:01,169
l set up a stake, and l got
somebody to move the goods.

629
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:03,601
We need a driver. Any suggestions?

630
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,434
How about Rudy?

631
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,403
Who's Rudy?

632
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:12,644
l'm half-wop, half-nigger.
l'm not afraid of nobody.

633
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:15,449
What do you do?

634
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,051
Name it, l claim it.

635
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:19,814
Rudy does catering. Rich joints.

636
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:20,853
All right.

637
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:22,218
Tell him about Baldy.

638
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:27,423
He's this old, rich ofay motherfucker.

639
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:29,656
l give him a bath every Friday night.

640
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:33,700
Towel him off,
talcum powder on him, put him to bed.

641
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,038
Just like a baby.
He gets his jollies off.

642
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:37,331
What about him?

643
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:41,500
Guy's got jewelry. He's got
a coin collection. He's got china.

644
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:43,976
-He's got rugs.
-That might be all right.

645
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,878
Shit, l know this town.
l got my own fences.

646
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:50,253
Who is this guy?

647
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:53,352
Who put you in charge?

648
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,217
You wanna be in charge?

649
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:56,255
l am in charge.

650
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,657
-You head nigger in charge.
-l'm the head nigger in charge.

651
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:01,160
Big-head nigger.

652
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:04,359
l'll tell you what.

653
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:07,294
Because l'm a fair man...

654
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,466
...and l like
big-head niggers like you.

655
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:12,639
We'll flip for it.

656
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:15,066
We'll flip this.

657
00:52:22,085 --> 00:52:23,575
She loves me.

658
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:26,251
She loves me not.

659
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,819
She loves me.

660
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:32,325
She loves me not.

661
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:35,754
She loves me.

662
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:52,439
l'll flip first.

663
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:55,680
Red, cool it. Come on.

664
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:57,683
Head man in charge, right?

665
00:52:58,255 --> 00:52:59,847
Put the gun down.

666
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:02,557
We believe you.

667
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:04,760
We believe you.

668
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:08,795
Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For chrissakes!

669
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,296
Your turn, Rudy.

670
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,866
Quit fooling around. Come on, guys.

671
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:20,306
You don't wanna flip?

672
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:23,175
-Let me show you how.
-Red, don't!

673
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,314
He doesn't know how.
l have to show him.

674
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:27,607
Did you miss something?

675
00:53:27,818 --> 00:53:30,651
You got your eyes open?
Look at me.

676
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,146
You don't have to do this, Red.

677
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:36,387
That was really dumb.

678
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,864
Your flip. You wanna do it?
No, you don't, do you?

679
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:45,398
l'll help you.

680
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:47,465
-Here.
-Red, don't.

681
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:52,138
Should we shoot that
wop nose of yours off?

682
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:55,834
Or is that the nigger side?
ls that the wop side or the nigger side?

683
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:59,476
ls that wop or nigger?
l guess that's the wop side.

684
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:01,047
l'm not going to jail.

685
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:04,277
Put the gun away.
Come on, this is enough.

686
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:06,581
Say goodbye, Rudy.

687
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:12,020
Rudy said something.

688
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:13,594
What'd you say?

689
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:16,521
Speak up.

690
00:54:19,402 --> 00:54:22,769
Jesus Christ!
When are you gonna stop?

691
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,740
l did two, so l owe you two.

692
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:27,203
You got it.

693
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:30,072
-l got it. What did you say?
-You got it.

694
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,941
Rudy says l got it.

695
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:35,248
Rudy, don't you ever...

696
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:38,785
...try and cross someone who
ain't afraid to die, you hear me?

697
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:41,554
All right.

698
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:43,654
This is what we'll do.

699
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,260
We'll hit old Talcum Powder tonight.

700
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:49,523
My friend Rudy's gonna
draw up the plans.

701
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,063
Everything that's in the house, right?

702
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:56,239
Peg, Sophia, you get those tools
like l asked you.

703
00:54:56,439 --> 00:55:00,739
We're gonna hit tonight because some of
us have high visibility during the day.

704
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:06,415
lt's okay with you, right?

705
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:11,950
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

706
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:13,986
One big happy family.

707
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:18,756
l love you.

708
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:44,649
What happened to the bullet?
Did you palm that bullet?

709
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,015
What bullet?

710
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:47,686
The bullet.

711
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:51,624
You're crazy.

712
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:04,062
Shorty!

713
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,759
Easy, Shorty, easy.

714
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:33,256
My man, Red.

715
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:36,029
My man!

716
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,735
When's Rudy due back?

717
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,294
Thirty minutes.

718
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:47,307
l'm almost finished.

719
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,744
Girls ought to be getting back
from casing that rug joint.

720
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:58,249
They should be.

721
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:01,820
We've done a good job.

722
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:03,652
We're killing them, ain't we?

723
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:09,391
They don't know what's hitting them.

724
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,762
-Let me work back in this kitchen.
-You getting the kitchen?

725
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:15,335
Putting naps on in the kitchen.

726
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:19,338
lf you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

727
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:22,274
All right, let's go to the sink.

728
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,281
Come on, it's starting to heat up.

729
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,510
-lt's burning?
-lt's all right.

730
00:58:32,188 --> 00:58:33,780
Put your head down.

731
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,283
-Come on, man.
-l turned it.

732
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:48,633
lt's started to sting.
Get out of the way!

733
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:54,874
lt's burning?

734
00:58:55,078 --> 00:58:56,705
Hell, yeah, it's burning!

735
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:02,007
Goddamn it!

736
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:11,088
Nigger, take your head
out of the shit bowl!

737
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:12,989
That's it. Get up slowly.

738
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:16,364
Watch it! No funny business now.

739
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:19,034
Red, the jig is up.

740
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:21,931
The average first offender
gets two years for burglary.

741
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:25,307
We were all first offenders.
That's what the girls drew.

742
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,976
Two years in the women's reformatory.

743
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:29,543
Our crime wasn't burglary.

744
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:33,373
It was sleeping with white girls.
They threw the book at us.

745
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:36,609
Burglary, count one, 8 to 1 0 years.

746
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,084
Count two, 8 to 1 0 years.

747
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:41,780
Count three, 8 to 1 0 years.

748
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:44,289
Count four, 8 to 1 0 years.

749
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:46,621
Count five, 8 to 1 0 years.

750
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:51,597
Count six, 8 to 1 0 years.
Count seven, 8 to 1 0 years.

751
00:59:51,868 --> 00:59:54,063
Count eight, 8 to 1 0 years.

752
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:58,730
Count nine, 8 to 1 0 years.
Count ten, 8 to 1 0 years.

753
00:59:58,942 --> 01:00:03,504
Count eleven, 8 to 1 0 years.
Count twelve, 8 to 1 0 years.

754
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:07,180
Count thirteen, 8 to 1 0 years,
and count fourteen--

755
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:10,011
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.

756
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,245
Sentences to run concurrently.

757
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:17,225
Shorty thought he'd given us 100 years,
until I explained "concurrently. "

758
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:19,918
It meant a minimum of
10 years hard labor...

759
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,462
...at the Charlestown State Prison.

760
01:00:22,665 --> 01:00:24,860
The date was February 1946.

761
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:26,330
Fuck you.

762
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:34,372
Cellblock A, secure.

763
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:12,810
Look at him.

764
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:14,176
l see him.

765
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,247
He about to bust?

766
01:01:16,452 --> 01:01:19,944
He not gonna bust.
He wouldn't give them the pleasure.

767
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:21,954
Little!

768
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:26,091
Your number.

769
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:27,426
Little!

770
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:28,790
What?

771
01:01:28,998 --> 01:01:30,056
Give him a break.

772
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,469
-He's a new fish.
-l'll give him a break.

773
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,567
Now state your number, Little.

774
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:37,999
l forgot it.

775
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:39,335
State it.

776
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:40,201
l forgot it.

777
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,071
You can read it!

778
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:44,075
-Can't you read, boy?
-Fuck you!

779
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:46,541
l'll teach you a lesson.

780
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:50,880
l forgot it!

781
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:52,412
l forgot it!

782
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:53,883
l forgot it!

783
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:02,258
They ain't gonna break me down.

784
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:09,830
l'm in this situation,
and l'm getting out.

785
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:12,474
Anything go wrong, l'm strong.

786
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:15,467
Time's up, Little.

787
01:02:16,212 --> 01:02:17,941
Now state your number.

788
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:23,445
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

789
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:28,848
Water!

790
01:02:30,526 --> 01:02:31,618
Water!

791
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:50,210
You want a smoke?

792
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,619
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son?

793
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:03,052
A friend?

794
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:08,527
He's a friend?
lf he's such a friend, where is he?

795
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:09,959
What's he done for me?

796
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,497
A friend!

797
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:15,166
Tell you what you do,
you tell him to call me.

798
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,897
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is.

799
01:03:18,107 --> 01:03:20,701
Solitary 2-2607.

800
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,037
What he done for me, chappy?

801
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:25,214
Where is he when l need him?

802
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:29,249
You tell me that! Where is this Jesus?
l'll tell you where.

803
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:32,886
He's out with the police captain!
l'll straighten him out!

804
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:36,183
What's he done for me?
He ain't done nothing for me!

805
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:44,560
"What a friend we have in Jesus."
Jesus can kiss my ass!

806
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:48,362
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass.
How about that? Tell him that.

807
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:43,182
Little!

808
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:47,489
State your number.

809
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:49,988
Come on, state it!

810
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,558
A-22....

811
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:53,736
What?

812
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:55,767
A-228....

813
01:04:57,106 --> 01:04:58,164
Come on.

814
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:16,281
l know how you feel.

815
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:18,588
Like you want to lay down and die.

816
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,388
l brought you something.

817
01:05:23,065 --> 01:05:25,431
l don't need no more favors from you.

818
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:26,659
lt's nutmeg.

819
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:31,272
Put it in the water. You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

820
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,965
lt's not cocaine,
but it'll help some.

821
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,546
Drink it slow.
The stuff is strong.

822
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,192
So what's your hype?

823
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:56,194
l can show you how to get out
of prison. And it's no hype.

824
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:58,560
Talk, daddy-o. l'm listening.

825
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:03,700
-This ain't bad. You got some more?
-That's the last fix l'm giving you.

826
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,367
So why'd you give it to me?

827
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:10,740
Because you needed it.
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

828
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:14,413
Nigger, get on out of my face.

829
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:17,983
l think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

830
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:20,212
Why the hell don't you use it?

831
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:25,493
You can't bust out of here
like they do in the movies.

832
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:28,194
Even if you get out,
you're still in prison.

833
01:06:28,397 --> 01:06:29,694
You ain't lying.

834
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:33,858
You'll bang against a stone wall.
You're not using your brain!

835
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,004
That's what the white man wants.

836
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,572
Look at you, putting all
that poison in your hair.

837
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:44,212
l think you been in prison too long.
Everybody on the outside conks.

838
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:46,711
Why does everybody on the outside conk?

839
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:50,044
They don't want to walk around
with a nappy head, looking like--

840
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:51,345
Looking like me?

841
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:52,918
Like a nigger?

842
01:06:54,423 --> 01:06:56,152
Why not look like what you are?

843
01:06:56,359 --> 01:06:58,884
What makes you ashamed of being black?

844
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:02,553
Let me tell you something.
l'm not ashamed of being anything.

845
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:08,663
You better let go.
l gotta wash this out.

846
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:11,863
-Let it burn!
-Nigger, get your hands off of me!

847
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:15,000
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself.

848
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:19,045
Put all that poison in your hair,
in your body, trying to be white!

849
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:24,248
-l don't want to hear this.
-l thought you were smart.

850
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:26,853
But you just another cat
strutting down the avenue...

851
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:29,251
...in your clown suit
with all that mess on you!

852
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:30,685
Looking like a monkey!

853
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:34,852
The white man sees you and laughs
because he knows you ain't white.

854
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:35,928
Who are you?

855
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:38,396
The question is, who are you?

856
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:41,064
l'll tell you.

857
01:07:41,837 --> 01:07:44,067
You are lost in the darkness.

858
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:48,770
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

859
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:49,740
Who?

860
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:51,641
Elijah Muhammad...

861
01:07:51,914 --> 01:07:54,405
...can get you out of prison.

862
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:57,582
Out of the prison of your mind.

863
01:07:58,421 --> 01:08:01,413
But maybe all you want is another fix.

864
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:19,567
--you get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

865
01:08:19,775 --> 01:08:22,608
You stop thinking and acting
for yourself.

866
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:26,907
lf you had to scrounge 3 squares a day,
you'd cut your throats.

867
01:08:27,249 --> 01:08:30,548
So you let them feed you,
give you dominoes to play with.

868
01:08:30,753 --> 01:08:34,189
-Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
-Let's go. Cut the sermon.

869
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:38,224
He blows his whistle and you sit,
you stand, you grab, gobble...

870
01:08:38,427 --> 01:08:39,451
...file out...

871
01:08:39,662 --> 01:08:41,789
...sleep, and sing out your number.

872
01:08:41,998 --> 01:08:43,829
l told you to knock it off.

873
01:08:46,102 --> 01:08:47,069
Now...

874
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:48,998
...are you gonna take yard?

875
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:52,504
l'm staying.

876
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:54,274
Me too.

877
01:09:05,454 --> 01:09:07,479
What are you sniffing around for?

878
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:10,352
l told you, l gave you your last fix.

879
01:09:14,163 --> 01:09:15,858
What's your angle, nigger?

880
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:20,161
"Nigger"?
Who's wearing the conk?

881
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,998
You the only cat in this prison
l done seen act like you do.

882
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:27,899
You ain't even afraid of the guards.

883
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:30,738
What's he gonna do to me
he hasn't done already?

884
01:09:32,648 --> 01:09:36,914
l mean, you don't cuss none. You don't
talk that "What-ya-know-daddy" jive.

885
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,987
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

886
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:48,990
l know you got a angle
some kind of way.

887
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:51,329
Don't con me.

888
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:55,667
Don't con me and don't try.

889
01:09:57,339 --> 01:10:00,740
Hey, just offering you a cigarette,
my man. Ain't no big deal.

890
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,741
l read, study.

891
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,919
The first thing a black man
must have is self-respect.

892
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:14,316
Respect his body and his mind.

893
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:17,117
Quit taking the white man's
poisons into his body.

894
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:22,023
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor,
his white women, his pork.

895
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:23,854
Pork?

896
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,434
My mama used to say don't eat no pork.

897
01:10:30,639 --> 01:10:35,076
Your mama was right.
A pig is a filthy beast.

898
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:38,713
Part rat, part cat
and the rest is dog.

899
01:10:38,914 --> 01:10:41,280
All right, pull my coat on this now.

900
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:43,679
What happen if you give all that up?

901
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:47,589
l mean, the pork. You get sick
and you get a medical or something?

902
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:51,282
Like when l was on the outside,
l ran this hustle. l tried--

903
01:10:51,494 --> 01:10:54,827
l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.

904
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:56,725
And l'm gonna tell you...

905
01:10:56,932 --> 01:10:57,899
...God is black.

906
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,967
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

907
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:05,129
You accepted everything the white man
taught. He said you were a heathen...

908
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:09,402
...and you believed him.
He said Jesus was blond and blue-eyed...

909
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:10,579
...with white skin...

910
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,179
...and you believed him.

911
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:15,783
He said that black was a curse
and you believed that.

912
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:18,510
-Ever look up the word "black"?
-For what?

913
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:21,053
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't a con?

914
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:22,781
What the hell for, man?

915
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:26,657
Come with me.

916
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:33,060
"Black: Destitute of light...

917
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:34,634
...devoid of color.

918
01:11:35,104 --> 01:11:36,628
Enveloped in darkness...

919
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:39,205
...hence utterly dismal or gloomy...

920
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:41,267
...as, 'The future looked black.' "

921
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,307
Pretty good with them words.

922
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:44,839
"Soiled with dirt...

923
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:46,270
...foul.

924
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:47,210
Sullen...

925
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:48,212
...hostile...

926
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:51,443
...forbidding, as, 'a black day.'

927
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:55,019
Foully or outrageously wicked...

928
01:11:55,224 --> 01:11:56,782
...as, 'black cruelty.'

929
01:11:56,992 --> 01:12:00,723
lndicating disgrace,
dishonor or culpability."

930
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,163
And there's others.
"Blackmail. Blackball. Blackguard."

931
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:06,800
That's something, all right.

932
01:12:07,236 --> 01:12:08,794
Let's look up "white."

933
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,299
Here.

934
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:15,475
Read.

935
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:19,346
"White:

936
01:12:20,516 --> 01:12:22,575
The color of pure snow.

937
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:26,819
Reflecting all the rays
of the spectrum.

938
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:28,482
The opposite of black.

939
01:12:33,762 --> 01:12:36,162
Free from spot or blemish.

940
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:39,861
lnnocent. Pure."

941
01:12:44,173 --> 01:12:46,733
Ain't this something?
"Without evil intent.

942
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:48,102
Harmless.

943
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:50,306
Honest, square-dealing...

944
01:12:50,512 --> 01:12:52,173
...and honorable."
Wait a minute.

945
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:55,612
This was written by white folks, though.

946
01:12:55,851 --> 01:12:58,445
-Sure ain't no black man's book.
-So why read it?

947
01:12:58,654 --> 01:13:01,350
So you can read the truth
behind the words.

948
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:05,687
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

949
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:12,362
There's a whole lot of words in here.

950
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:15,529
Here. Let's start at the beginning.

951
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:20,030
We'll look them up, write them down
and find out what they mean.

952
01:13:20,309 --> 01:13:23,301
Page one. The first word: "Aardvark."

953
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,375
"Aardvark.

954
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:31,485
Earth pig.
African, ant-eating mammal.

955
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:33,353
Abacus:

956
01:13:33,555 --> 01:13:37,218
Chinese calculating instrument.

957
01:13:39,662 --> 01:13:40,788
Abaddon:

958
01:13:40,996 --> 01:13:44,454
The place of the lost in Sheol.

959
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,066
The bottomless pit."

960
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:48,793
lf you take one step toward Allah...

961
01:13:49,004 --> 01:13:50,995
...he'll take two steps toward you.

962
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:57,744
Lights out!

963
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:38,549
Boy'll wear out a baseball.

964
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:41,480
-What's the score, my man?
-1 0 to 1 .

965
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,284
We're murdering them!
Didn't you hear?

966
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:45,458
No. What happened?

967
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:49,893
The Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson!
We're pouding them, celebrating!

968
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,828
That's all right.

969
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:53,332
Sure.

970
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:57,197
White man throw us a bone
and we're supposed to forget...

971
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:58,998
...400 years of oppression.

972
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:01,232
Yeah, but a nigger--

973
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,745
A Negro in the big leagues,
that's something.

974
01:15:04,913 --> 01:15:08,246
l told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

975
01:15:08,584 --> 01:15:11,485
They let us sing and dance
and smile...

976
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:14,946
...and then they let one
so-called Negro into the majors.

977
01:15:15,157 --> 01:15:17,751
That doesn't cancel out history's
greatest crime.

978
01:15:18,027 --> 01:15:21,053
When that grafted, blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains...

979
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:24,494
...one hundred million of us,
broke up our families...

980
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,099
...tortured us...

981
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:30,135
...cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history....

982
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:34,239
Let me tell you about black history.

983
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:37,037
We are the original man.

984
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:40,306
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled.

985
01:15:40,516 --> 01:15:43,314
And there wasn't
a white face anywhere.

986
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:46,144
But they teach us
that we swung from trees.

987
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:49,688
That's a lie.
Black men never did that.

988
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:52,452
We were a race of kings
when the white man...

989
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:54,754
...crawled on all fours in Europe.

990
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:57,022
Do they know who they are?

991
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:01,832
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

992
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:02,935
Malcolm Little.

993
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:07,337
That's the name of the slave masters
that owned your family.

994
01:16:08,143 --> 01:16:10,134
You don't even know who you are.

995
01:16:10,345 --> 01:16:12,973
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.

996
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:14,672
Who are you?

997
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,415
Look, l ain't--
Shit!

998
01:16:24,593 --> 01:16:27,562
All right, l ain't Malcolm Little.
Or Red. Or Satan.

999
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:29,287
That's right.
So who are you?

1000
01:16:33,936 --> 01:16:36,268
-l don't know.
-We are a nation...

1001
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:38,538
...of the tribe of Shabazz...

1002
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:42,403
...lost in this wilderness called
North America.

1003
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:51,382
Tribe of Shabazz.

1004
01:16:51,587 --> 01:16:54,021
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger...

1005
01:16:54,223 --> 01:16:56,487
...a black man
named Elijah Muhammad.

1006
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,451
He reveals to us the true
knowledge about ourselves.

1007
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:04,722
He teaches that the true nature
of the original man, the black man...

1008
01:17:04,967 --> 01:17:06,559
...is righteousness.

1009
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:09,435
lf the black man's nature
is righteousness....

1010
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:12,368
Then the true nature of
the white man is wickedness.

1011
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:14,132
l knew you'd get it.

1012
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:18,243
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches
that the white man is a devil.

1013
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,915
l sure met some in my life.

1014
01:17:22,918 --> 01:17:27,150
Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

1015
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:30,990
He teaches us that
all white men are devils.

1016
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:35,757
Have you ever known a good white man?
Think back in all your life.

1017
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:39,260
Have you ever met one
who wasn't evil?

1018
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,071
The body is a sacred temple...

1019
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:51,542
...it must be purified.

1020
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:55,948
l will not touch
the white man's poison:

1021
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:57,550
His drugs...

1022
01:17:57,986 --> 01:17:59,453
...his liquor...

1023
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:02,650
...his swine...

1024
01:18:02,858 --> 01:18:03,950
...his women.

1025
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:07,455
A Muslim must be strikingly upright...

1026
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:09,493
...an outstanding example...

1027
01:18:09,698 --> 01:18:13,156
...so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

1028
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:18,535
l will not commit
adultery or fornication.

1029
01:18:20,142 --> 01:18:21,769
l will not lie...

1030
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:23,706
...cheat or steal.

1031
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:27,481
But the key to lslam is submission.

1032
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:35,512
That is why five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray...

1033
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:38,215
...to bend our knees in submission.

1034
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,162
l can't do that, Brother Baines.

1035
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,961
The lost, found,
must bend their knees...

1036
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:48,659
...to admit their guilt.

1037
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:53,569
To implore Allah's forgiveness
is the hardest thing on earth.

1038
01:18:59,514 --> 01:19:01,846
The hardest and the greatest.

1039
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:09,521
l don't know
what l would say to Allah.

1040
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:12,526
Have you ever bent your knees?

1041
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:17,355
Yes, when l was...

1042
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:20,924
...picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

1043
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,398
Tell Allah that.

1044
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:38,042
You can grovel and crawl for sin
but not to save your soul?

1045
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,278
Pick the lock.
Pick it.

1046
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:42,550
l want to.

1047
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:48,195
God knows l want to.

1048
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:02,940
I received a letter that day
from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1049
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:05,406
The dear Holy Apostle
wrote to me...

1050
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,447
...a nobody, a junkie, a pimp
and a convict.

1051
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,619
I have come to give you...

1052
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:15,717
...something which can
never be taken away from you.

1053
01:20:15,957 --> 01:20:20,894
I bring to you
a sense of your own worth...

1054
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:24,494
...the worth of one human being.

1055
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,191
The knowledge of self.

1056
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:31,702
It was like a blinding light. I was
aware that he was in the room with me.

1057
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,209
He wore a dark suit,
and on his face I saw a wisdom...

1058
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:39,073
...and pain so old and deep
that I could scarcely look at him.

1059
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:42,846
But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was there with me.

1060
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,916
I tell you...

1061
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:49,654
...the most dangerous creation
in the world...

1062
01:20:49,991 --> 01:20:52,255
...in any society...

1063
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:55,422
...is the man with nothing to lose.

1064
01:20:55,664 --> 01:21:00,601
You do not need 10 such men
to change the world.

1065
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:03,494
One will do.

1066
01:21:04,606 --> 01:21:07,507
The earth belongs to us...

1067
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:09,108
...the black man.

1068
01:21:09,444 --> 01:21:11,810
And whatever is around it...

1069
01:21:12,013 --> 01:21:15,005
...or on it, or in it...

1070
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:17,308
...belongs to us.

1071
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:19,680
And then as suddenly as he came...

1072
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:21,014
...he was gone.

1073
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:24,716
And then I could do it.

1074
01:21:27,629 --> 01:21:28,926
We're taught that Paul...

1075
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:32,498
...on the road to Damascus,
heard the voice of Christ.

1076
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:35,737
He was so smitten by the truth
that he fell from his horse.

1077
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:38,098
Now, I don't liken myself to Paul...

1078
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:40,034
...but I do understand.

1079
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:43,168
You see, it happened to me.

1080
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:44,470
Why me?

1081
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:50,945
Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back
in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.

1082
01:21:51,219 --> 01:21:54,484
We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.

1083
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:58,591
My wife and my sonjoin me in saying
that when you come out...

1084
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:01,126
...which won't be long,
come straight to us.

1085
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:02,296
Next.

1086
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,127
What'll it be?

1087
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:13,206
Take it all off.

1088
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:15,899
-Getting rid of that conk, huh?
-Yes, sir.

1089
01:22:17,412 --> 01:22:19,471
You write, thanking me.

1090
01:22:20,415 --> 01:22:24,647
Don't thank me, thank Allah.
He did it all.

1091
01:22:27,355 --> 01:22:28,982
Dear Brother Baines:

1092
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:32,318
Please thank Elijah Muhammad
for the money...

1093
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:35,393
...and tell him
I haven't written him...

1094
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:37,565
...because I've
not yet proven myself.

1095
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:41,998
But I have shared his teachings
with old running buddies in Harlem...

1096
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:45,640
...and with my main man, Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.

1097
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,103
He's gone nuts.

1098
01:22:47,309 --> 01:22:48,742
"Dear Brothers:

1099
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,671
l thank you for
your time and concern.

1100
01:22:52,581 --> 01:22:56,517
All praises due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1101
01:22:56,852 --> 01:22:59,548
l wrote the mayor, the governor
and the President...

1102
01:22:59,754 --> 01:23:03,053
...but for some reason
l haven't heard from them."

1103
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:05,953
Please tell Elijah...

1104
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:10,791
...I have dedicated my life to telling
the white devil the truth to his face.

1105
01:23:10,999 --> 01:23:15,060
I greet you with the ancient words
ofpeace, "As-Salaam-Alaikum. "

1106
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:18,901
P.S. I finally copied out the
entire dictionary.

1107
01:23:20,509 --> 01:23:23,740
l think the brother is coming along.

1108
01:23:25,313 --> 01:23:29,010
"The thief cometh not
but for to steal...

1109
01:23:29,284 --> 01:23:32,947
...and to kill, and to destroy.

1110
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:34,949
But l am come...

1111
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:37,253
...that they might have life...

1112
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:41,518
...and that they might have it
more abundantly."

1113
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:46,831
Saint John 1 0, verse 1 0.
Are there any questions?

1114
01:23:51,172 --> 01:23:53,868
Watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

1115
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:59,042
l see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

1116
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:00,544
"Satan" has a question.

1117
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:04,241
Yes, sir. But since
neither of us are God...

1118
01:24:04,452 --> 01:24:07,546
...neither of us can say
who's good and who's evil.

1119
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:08,984
Just ask your question.

1120
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:12,853
We were discussing the Disciples.
What color were they?

1121
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:15,552
Well, l don't think...

1122
01:24:16,031 --> 01:24:17,362
...we know for certain.

1123
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:19,625
-But they were Hebrews?
-That's right.

1124
01:24:19,834 --> 01:24:21,893
As was Jesus.
Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1125
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:24,637
Just ask your question.

1126
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:26,272
What color were the Hebrews?

1127
01:24:26,474 --> 01:24:29,932
l have told you that
we don't know that for certain.

1128
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:34,241
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

1129
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:36,747
Just a moment. Just a moment.

1130
01:24:37,919 --> 01:24:40,888
God is white.
lsn't it obvious?

1131
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:43,922
That's obvious, but it's
not obvious that God is white.

1132
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,717
Elijah Muhammad teaches us...

1133
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:48,521
...that Jesus didn't have
blond hair and blue eyes.

1134
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,290
Elijah Muhammad teaches that
images of Jesus...

1135
01:24:51,499 --> 01:24:54,297
...in prisons and churches
throughout the world...

1136
01:24:54,502 --> 01:24:56,197
...are not historically correct.

1137
01:24:56,404 --> 01:24:58,099
Because history teaches us...

1138
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:01,469
...Jesus was born in a region where
the people had color.

1139
01:25:01,676 --> 01:25:04,201
There's proof in the Bible
you ask us to read...

1140
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:07,279
...in Revelations, chapter 1 ,
verses 1 4 and 1 5...

1141
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:09,382
...that Jesus had hair like wool...

1142
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:11,381
...and feet the color of brass.

1143
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:14,180
-What're you saying?
-l'm not saying anything.

1144
01:25:14,389 --> 01:25:18,348
l'm proving to you that Jesus was not,
to quote an lndian brother...

1145
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,051
...he was not a paleface.

1146
01:25:23,098 --> 01:25:23,723
Amen.

1147
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:26,261
lsn't that interesting!

1148
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:31,069
Brother Malcolm.

1149
01:25:31,406 --> 01:25:32,737
Brother Malcolm.

1150
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:36,234
He's waiting for you.

1151
01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:22,785
My son....

1152
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,620
You have been a thief...

1153
01:26:29,364 --> 01:26:32,197
...a drug dealer and a hustler...

1154
01:26:33,635 --> 01:26:36,627
...and the world
is still full of temptation.

1155
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:46,008
When God spoke to the devil about
how faithful Job was...

1156
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:47,544
...the devil argued...

1157
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:50,843
...that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

1158
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:53,418
...that kept him pure.

1159
01:26:54,022 --> 01:26:55,512
ln fact, the devil said:

1160
01:26:55,724 --> 01:27:00,286
"Remove that hedge
and he will curse his Maker."

1161
01:27:01,896 --> 01:27:03,158
Well, Malcolm...

1162
01:27:04,899 --> 01:27:07,834
...your hedge has been removed.

1163
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:12,829
And l believe...

1164
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:15,233
...you...

1165
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:17,872
...will remain faithful.

1166
01:27:18,546 --> 01:27:19,843
Yes, sir.

1167
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:25,377
Thank you, sister.

1168
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:27,214
How many of these should we make?

1169
01:27:27,422 --> 01:27:29,049
-Five hundred.
-Make it 1 000.

1170
01:27:29,624 --> 01:27:33,458
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

1171
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:38,763
Brother Earl's dedicated.
We need good men like him.

1172
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:42,263
l'm a willing servant for
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1173
01:27:42,537 --> 01:27:44,368
Go ahead, brothers.
lKeep it busy.

1174
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:47,669
Take a real good look
at not just where you live...

1175
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:51,175
...but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives.

1176
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:54,678
l don't want you to think
you're some bad-luck accident.

1177
01:27:54,883 --> 01:27:57,909
Then l want you to go downtown,
to Central Park West....

1178
01:28:01,055 --> 01:28:02,352
Go in other communities....

1179
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:05,492
You've never seen
a Booker T. Washington store...

1180
01:28:05,693 --> 01:28:07,126
...in an ltalian community.

1181
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:10,422
You've never seen no
Frederick Douglass delicatessen...

1182
01:28:10,632 --> 01:28:11,963
...in the Jewish community.

1183
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:15,694
Why's everybody in this community
making money but us?

1184
01:28:15,904 --> 01:28:18,896
lt's time for black men and women
to stand up...

1185
01:28:19,107 --> 01:28:21,132
...and take control of our dollars.

1186
01:28:21,342 --> 01:28:25,176
lt's time for us to use our dollars
for our liberation.

1187
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,838
We can do what everyone else can
if we become producers...

1188
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:32,019
...and if we become
the masters of our own destiny.

1189
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,950
We can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else.

1190
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:37,056
But where are our clothing stores?

1191
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:41,558
We can get milk from cows,
but where are our grocery stores?

1192
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:45,631
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

1193
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:48,928
The only thing they respect
is our dollars!

1194
01:28:51,139 --> 01:28:53,471
--the so-called freedom
we should have.

1195
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,869
The Statue of Liberty
stands like this.

1196
01:28:56,077 --> 01:28:59,240
For us, it may as well say,
"Stop, don't come no further."

1197
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:02,612
"Don't come no further."

1198
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:04,944
Brothers and sisters,
l want you to....

1199
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:07,246
l want you to come down
to the temple.

1200
01:29:07,455 --> 01:29:09,116
Oh, l'm so surprised!

1201
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:12,418
l'm so surprised.
You all been in church two hours...

1202
01:29:12,627 --> 01:29:16,358
...expecting to see heaven,
but you're still here on earth.

1203
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:19,158
Why don't you come on down
to the temple at 2:00?

1204
01:29:19,367 --> 01:29:21,597
You'll hear truth,
the black man's truth.

1205
01:29:21,803 --> 01:29:25,705
No, you can't deny it.
You been on your knees for hours...

1206
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:28,171
...begging some God to help you
in the hereafter.

1207
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:31,903
But the hereafter is right now.
The hereafter is here and now.

1208
01:29:32,113 --> 01:29:33,842
Let me talk to you, brother.

1209
01:29:34,048 --> 01:29:36,915
l know you're a smart man
and a wise man.

1210
01:29:37,118 --> 01:29:38,050
You look good.

1211
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:41,711
Now, you're in church every day,
praying to this God.

1212
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:44,015
But these so-called white Christians...

1213
01:29:44,225 --> 01:29:46,625
...hang our black Christians
from trees.

1214
01:29:46,961 --> 01:29:50,419
This man hates you.
He doesn't do anything for you.

1215
01:29:50,632 --> 01:29:52,964
He tells you to foam at
the mouth and sing...

1216
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:55,567
...and hope for something
in the hereafter.

1217
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:57,032
We can have it now.

1218
01:29:57,238 --> 01:29:59,468
-Come on down, 2:00.
-See you later.

1219
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:02,905
As-Salaam-Alaikum
That means, "Peace be unto you."

1220
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:06,171
We have two children.
Carla, who's two, and....

1221
01:30:06,381 --> 01:30:09,111
Don't be ashamed when l call
you black. You are.

1222
01:30:09,317 --> 01:30:12,309
You're black and you're beautiful.
Black is beautiful.

1223
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,887
You don't have to come here
begging these folks for a job.

1224
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:19,059
You can wash their clothes
and scrub floors for them.

1225
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:22,457
You can rock their little
brats to sleep your whole life.

1226
01:30:22,664 --> 01:30:24,222
You'll still end up poor.

1227
01:30:24,432 --> 01:30:27,424
Yet you're here on the auction block
being examined...

1228
01:30:27,635 --> 01:30:29,796
...like you're a horse or a slave.

1229
01:30:30,004 --> 01:30:33,030
You see this here?
This is who you are. Beautiful.

1230
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:36,836
Your beautiful black selves,
with pride and dignity.

1231
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:42,473
l'd also expect you to work one
Saturday every month...

1232
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:45,414
...and occasionally in the evening--

1233
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:55,061
See, these are the questions
you and l have to ask:

1234
01:30:55,263 --> 01:30:56,730
"How did we get this mind?"

1235
01:30:56,931 --> 01:31:00,765
You're not an American, but an African
who happens to be in America.

1236
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:02,764
You must understand the difference.

1237
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:06,463
We didn't come over on the Nina,
the Pinta and the whatchamacallit.

1238
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:10,474
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

1239
01:31:10,845 --> 01:31:13,370
Landed right on top of us.

1240
01:31:15,984 --> 01:31:16,951
Shorty?

1241
01:31:18,052 --> 01:31:19,610
ls that you, brother?

1242
01:31:19,821 --> 01:31:23,757
Now, this is exactly what l'm talking
about, the slave mentality...

1243
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:25,016
...the slave mind.

1244
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:27,126
This brother and l had
the slave mind.

1245
01:31:27,328 --> 01:31:30,229
We used to rob together.
We slept with white women.

1246
01:31:30,431 --> 01:31:32,092
We even went to prison together.

1247
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,326
Don't be surprised.
Some of you are still in prison...

1248
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:36,935
...prisons of your mind.

1249
01:31:37,138 --> 01:31:38,833
Stand up, brother.
Come on.

1250
01:31:40,408 --> 01:31:42,273
The brother's a little shy.

1251
01:31:42,477 --> 01:31:44,638
Come on, brother.
Give me a hug.

1252
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:48,239
That's all right, brother.

1253
01:31:49,717 --> 01:31:51,685
Look, he's still got his hair fried.

1254
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:54,650
That's the slave mind.

1255
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:57,984
Red, that's the best preacher hype
l ever did hear.

1256
01:31:58,192 --> 01:32:00,057
No hype, brother.
lt's the truth.

1257
01:32:00,261 --> 01:32:02,320
Come back to the temple
and hear more.

1258
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,293
l can't pay that shit no mind.

1259
01:32:04,499 --> 01:32:06,899
You need to pay it all your mind.
What's left.

1260
01:32:07,101 --> 01:32:09,501
Take it easy.
This is me. Shorty.

1261
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:11,399
Let's go around the corner....

1262
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:16,273
No, sir. Not anymore.
l've been clean for eight years.

1263
01:32:16,477 --> 01:32:18,104
-Eight years?
-Eight years.

1264
01:32:18,312 --> 01:32:22,339
My trouble is, l love pigs feet
and white women too much.

1265
01:32:22,617 --> 01:32:24,847
So l damn sure can't be no Muslim.

1266
01:32:25,053 --> 01:32:28,955
That's because you're lost, brother.
That's because you're lost.

1267
01:32:29,457 --> 01:32:31,118
But we can find you.

1268
01:32:35,396 --> 01:32:37,387
What do you hear about
the old gang?

1269
01:32:37,965 --> 01:32:39,455
You heard about Sammy?

1270
01:32:39,767 --> 01:32:44,204
Dead. Knocked over in bed with
a chick 25 years younger than he was.

1271
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:49,342
Had 25 grand in his pocket, also.
Guess it was his lucky number.

1272
01:32:49,877 --> 01:32:52,471
What about....

1273
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:53,874
What was his name?

1274
01:32:54,082 --> 01:32:55,515
Cadillac?

1275
01:32:55,716 --> 01:32:56,774
Gone too?

1276
01:32:56,984 --> 01:33:01,148
Hooked on heroin. Been in and out
of Lexington five or six times.

1277
01:33:01,355 --> 01:33:02,185
Sophia?

1278
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:04,790
Still happily married
to that rich ofay.

1279
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:07,153
-She married him?
-She married him.

1280
01:33:07,595 --> 01:33:09,085
Went for the money.

1281
01:33:09,397 --> 01:33:11,865
-The money.
-Thank you, honey.

1282
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:15,231
l haven't seen
West lndian Archie.

1283
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:18,303
Grapevine says
he's living in the Bronx.

1284
01:33:18,506 --> 01:33:20,406
If you wanna call that living.

1285
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:22,371
It's been good seeing you.

1286
01:33:22,577 --> 01:33:24,169
Same here, Red.

1287
01:33:30,585 --> 01:33:35,284
Get the hell away from me, bitch!

1288
01:33:38,826 --> 01:33:41,294
l'll pay you tomorrow!

1289
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:56,970
How you doing, Archie?

1290
01:33:57,478 --> 01:33:59,309
My man, Red.

1291
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:03,473
Come here, man.

1292
01:34:07,822 --> 01:34:10,052
No, don't get up.
lt's all right.

1293
01:34:17,832 --> 01:34:19,163
ls...

1294
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:23,066
...really you, Red?

1295
01:34:24,172 --> 01:34:25,571
Yes, it's me.

1296
01:34:30,011 --> 01:34:31,740
l came to...

1297
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,172
...just to thank you...

1298
01:34:36,017 --> 01:34:37,712
...for saving my life.

1299
01:34:37,919 --> 01:34:41,480
When l think back to when
we were in Harlem trying to...

1300
01:34:41,822 --> 01:34:43,221
...gun each other down--

1301
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:45,654
l wasn't going to shoot you, man.

1302
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:48,250
lt was...

1303
01:34:48,896 --> 01:34:50,420
...just my rep.

1304
01:34:51,365 --> 01:34:52,354
You know?

1305
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:56,599
All l had was my rep.

1306
01:34:58,272 --> 01:34:59,364
But now...

1307
01:35:01,742 --> 01:35:03,039
...you tell me this.

1308
01:35:03,544 --> 01:35:06,707
You did really have that number?

1309
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,380
l don't know, Archie....

1310
01:35:10,718 --> 01:35:12,743
l don't remember,
and it's not important.

1311
01:35:12,954 --> 01:35:16,788
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

1312
01:35:18,226 --> 01:35:20,717
You know, l have some angles...

1313
01:35:22,697 --> 01:35:24,494
...ain't been figured yet.

1314
01:35:32,473 --> 01:35:33,599
lt's all right.

1315
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:40,638
Help me with my arm.

1316
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:44,414
l need to exercise my arm.

1317
01:35:51,926 --> 01:35:53,223
That's better?

1318
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:55,725
Yep.
lt feels good.

1319
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:57,989
Good.

1320
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:06,406
What happened to our women?
They could've been doctors, lawyers...

1321
01:36:06,607 --> 01:36:09,804
...or teachers or mothers.
Who'll raise our children?

1322
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:11,569
What happened to our men?

1323
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:15,977
Men who could've been mathematicians,
electricians, physicians.

1324
01:36:16,183 --> 01:36:18,549
What's the little boy gonna do...

1325
01:36:18,753 --> 01:36:21,813
...when he's looking for his father
who's in jail?

1326
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:23,418
What'll the girl do...

1327
01:36:23,624 --> 01:36:27,458
...when she's looking for her mother
who's out selling herself?

1328
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:32,497
I'm telling you, that devil has made
dead souls out of you and I.

1329
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,492
You're dead, spiritually.

1330
01:36:34,702 --> 01:36:38,433
You're dead to the knowledge
of yourself and your people...

1331
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,937
...and to the knowledge
of your God.

1332
01:36:41,142 --> 01:36:44,270
Why, he should get down on his knees.

1333
01:36:44,478 --> 01:36:45,604
He should beg our mercy.

1334
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,038
Oh, my brothers and sisters...

1335
01:36:48,249 --> 01:36:50,877
...his kind has committed
God's greatest crime...

1336
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:54,612
...against your and my kind
every day of his life!

1337
01:36:54,822 --> 01:36:58,519
He should get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime.

1338
01:36:58,726 --> 01:36:59,784
But does he do that?

1339
01:36:59,994 --> 01:37:03,122
Does he do that?
No, no, he scorns you.

1340
01:37:03,331 --> 01:37:05,526
He splits your head with
his nightstick.

1341
01:37:05,733 --> 01:37:08,327
He busts you in the head
with his billy club.

1342
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,197
And he calls you a nigger...

1343
01:37:10,404 --> 01:37:14,272
...a coon. That's what he says to you.
"Boy!" "Nigger!"

1344
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:16,466
Four hundred years is long enough.

1345
01:37:16,677 --> 01:37:20,135
You've sat down and laid down
and bowed down for 400 years.

1346
01:37:20,348 --> 01:37:24,045
l think it's time to stand up.
l think it's time to stand up.

1347
01:37:24,251 --> 01:37:26,082
-We're with you!
-All right.

1348
01:37:26,287 --> 01:37:27,219
Bless you.

1349
01:37:34,228 --> 01:37:36,924
Glory! My Lord!
Praise Him!

1350
01:37:51,145 --> 01:37:53,010
Yes, sir.
Next Wednesday, 8:00.

1351
01:37:53,214 --> 01:37:54,613
l'll see you there.

1352
01:37:55,883 --> 01:37:57,908
Brother Baines?
Excuse me, sister.

1353
01:37:58,119 --> 01:38:01,179
Do you think we can get
a loudspeaker set up outside?

1354
01:38:01,389 --> 01:38:02,617
l'm sure we can.

1355
01:38:02,823 --> 01:38:04,916
Brother Malcolm,
this is Sister Betty.

1356
01:38:05,126 --> 01:38:07,856
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

1357
01:38:08,062 --> 01:38:11,190
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

1358
01:38:11,465 --> 01:38:12,659
Good.

1359
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:15,631
-As-Salaam-Alaikum.
-Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

1360
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:18,861
Brother Minister...

1361
01:38:19,073 --> 01:38:22,509
...the sister wonders if you know
what Harriet Tubman did...

1362
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:25,702
...between taking souls to the
Promised Land?

1363
01:38:25,913 --> 01:38:28,143
No. What's that, sister?

1364
01:38:29,483 --> 01:38:30,916
She ate.

1365
01:38:34,321 --> 01:38:35,652
Excuse me.

1366
01:38:44,765 --> 01:38:45,891
She's interesting.

1367
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,467
Minister, l was hoping
you'd come and speak to my class.

1368
01:38:50,738 --> 01:38:52,603
Yes, l'll speak to your class.

1369
01:38:53,441 --> 01:38:56,205
-But l'm a hard man on the women.
-Are you?

1370
01:38:56,944 --> 01:38:59,469
We must be very careful
when it comes to women.

1371
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:02,012
Too many of our women...

1372
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:05,074
...have too much
of the devil in them.

1373
01:39:05,486 --> 01:39:07,613
Bleaching and dyeing...

1374
01:39:09,156 --> 01:39:11,454
...and ironing their hair.

1375
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:16,487
Running around
in the streets half-naked.

1376
01:39:18,566 --> 01:39:19,828
Talking too much.

1377
01:39:20,034 --> 01:39:21,661
Listening to the wrong men...

1378
01:39:21,869 --> 01:39:25,430
...making them
deceitful, untrustworthy, fresh.

1379
01:39:25,639 --> 01:39:27,971
And you men are to blame too.

1380
01:39:28,175 --> 01:39:32,043
We don't protect, we don't value,
we don't even support them.

1381
01:39:32,613 --> 01:39:34,308
See, the building of
a new nation...

1382
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:37,213
...begins with the woman.

1383
01:39:37,718 --> 01:39:39,481
Because the mother...

1384
01:39:39,887 --> 01:39:42,321
...is the first teacher of the child.

1385
01:39:42,556 --> 01:39:46,253
The message she gives that child,
the child gives to the world.

1386
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:50,462
When it comes to choosing a mate...

1387
01:39:50,998 --> 01:39:55,367
...Samson, the strongest man
that ever lived, was destroyed...

1388
01:39:55,569 --> 01:39:58,060
...by the woman
that slept in his arms.

1389
01:39:58,272 --> 01:40:00,740
Should l tell my sisters, then...

1390
01:40:01,008 --> 01:40:03,408
...that we don't believe in marriage?

1391
01:40:03,611 --> 01:40:06,205
No, we don't oppose marriage.

1392
01:40:06,413 --> 01:40:08,244
We're not Catholic priests.

1393
01:40:08,449 --> 01:40:10,212
We don't believe in celibacy.

1394
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:12,681
Mr. Muhammad teaches
that if a woman...

1395
01:40:12,887 --> 01:40:15,617
...is the right height
and complexion for a man--

1396
01:40:15,823 --> 01:40:17,154
lf she's...

1397
01:40:17,391 --> 01:40:19,120
...half the man's age, plus seven.

1398
01:40:21,536 --> 01:40:23,060
And if...

1399
01:40:23,271 --> 01:40:27,901
...she understands that man's
essential nature is strong...

1400
01:40:28,242 --> 01:40:30,267
...and she's
willing to support that.

1401
01:40:30,812 --> 01:40:32,336
And if she...

1402
01:40:32,847 --> 01:40:35,281
...can sew and cook and...

1403
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:37,112
...loves children...

1404
01:40:37,318 --> 01:40:39,377
...and stays out of trouble....

1405
01:40:39,587 --> 01:40:42,647
l think you've made your points,
Brother Minister.

1406
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:43,824
Good.

1407
01:40:44,025 --> 01:40:46,493
You haven't any time for marriage.

1408
01:40:48,296 --> 01:40:51,754
So what l'll do is
write the chapters down for you...

1409
01:40:52,133 --> 01:40:52,997
All right.

1410
01:40:53,201 --> 01:40:56,500
...as well as the New Testament
chapters in St. Matthew.

1411
01:40:56,804 --> 01:40:58,101
Brother Minister....

1412
01:40:58,306 --> 01:41:01,070
l hope you'll still
come visit my class, though.

1413
01:41:01,275 --> 01:41:04,267
No, l'd love to come to your class.
l love to teach.

1414
01:41:04,612 --> 01:41:08,104
l love sharing. This is the wonderful
thing about Mr. Muhammad:

1415
01:41:08,316 --> 01:41:12,650
When he gives you this knowledge,
you can't help but share it--

1416
01:41:12,854 --> 01:41:15,618
Excuse me, Brother Minister...

1417
01:41:15,823 --> 01:41:17,518
...would it be okay if we...

1418
01:41:17,725 --> 01:41:19,590
...just sat down for a moment?

1419
01:41:19,794 --> 01:41:22,285
lt's a big building and....

1420
01:41:24,165 --> 01:41:27,430
Sister, l'm sorry.
l've had you on your feet all day.

1421
01:41:28,302 --> 01:41:29,462
My mistake.

1422
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:31,900
You've been on your feet for days.

1423
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:36,376
And you didn't even finish your salad.

1424
01:41:38,913 --> 01:41:41,313
So let's talk about you
for a change.

1425
01:41:41,849 --> 01:41:43,180
How tall are you?

1426
01:41:44,752 --> 01:41:45,912
Why do you ask?

1427
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,348
ldle question.

1428
01:41:47,922 --> 01:41:52,325
Well, if it's just an idle question,
l hope l'm not forced to answer.

1429
01:41:53,327 --> 01:41:55,989
No, l won't force you.

1430
01:42:01,035 --> 01:42:04,630
Brother Baines says that
l'm tall enough for a tall man.

1431
01:42:04,839 --> 01:42:06,670
He's briefed you also?

1432
01:42:08,943 --> 01:42:10,501
How old are you, sister?

1433
01:42:11,312 --> 01:42:14,577
You know, there are
a few things about women...

1434
01:42:14,782 --> 01:42:16,773
...that you don't understand.

1435
01:42:16,984 --> 01:42:20,283
Some of us, we're
quite possessive, very vain...

1436
01:42:21,022 --> 01:42:24,355
...and persistent when
we've set our mind to something.

1437
01:42:24,892 --> 01:42:27,360
What have you set your mind to?

1438
01:42:29,497 --> 01:42:31,226
Being a good Muslim...

1439
01:42:32,066 --> 01:42:33,795
...a good nurse...

1440
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:37,128
...and a good wife.

1441
01:42:38,072 --> 01:42:39,369
Brother Malcolm?

1442
01:42:39,574 --> 01:42:41,098
-Excuse me.
-Certainly.

1443
01:42:41,309 --> 01:42:43,937
Brother Johnson was attacked
by the police.

1444
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:46,844
Excuse me.

1445
01:42:47,048 --> 01:42:48,948
-A scuffle!
-He was just watching.

1446
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:52,449
-The cop said, "Move on!"
-He didn't move quick enough for him.

1447
01:42:52,653 --> 01:42:54,883
Crack! He was bleeding
like a stuck hog.

1448
01:42:55,089 --> 01:42:57,250
So what you gonna do?

1449
01:42:57,959 --> 01:43:00,860
He'll rap a little.
He's a Muslim!

1450
01:43:01,062 --> 01:43:03,997
But you ain't gonna do nothing
but make a speech.

1451
01:43:04,465 --> 01:43:07,730
Muslims talk a good game,
but they never do nothing...

1452
01:43:08,202 --> 01:43:10,932
...unless somebody bothers Muslims.

1453
01:43:31,726 --> 01:43:33,489
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

1454
01:43:33,694 --> 01:43:35,491
Who the hell are you?

1455
01:43:35,696 --> 01:43:37,596
The minister
of Muslim Temple No. 7.

1456
01:43:37,798 --> 01:43:39,459
Never heard of you.

1457
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:41,167
-Where is he?
-Not here.

1458
01:43:41,369 --> 01:43:43,599
Wait a second.
What is your name?

1459
01:43:43,804 --> 01:43:46,102
Don't worry about what my name is.

1460
01:43:46,307 --> 01:43:50,073
Two witnesses saw Johnson brought here
beat up, but not brought out.

1461
01:43:50,278 --> 01:43:53,406
You didn't hear the sergeant?
Outside!

1462
01:43:53,614 --> 01:43:56,139
l suggest you look outside
that window.

1463
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:08,951
Jimmy, come here a second.

1464
01:44:09,163 --> 01:44:11,563
We intend to see Brother Johnson.

1465
01:44:12,366 --> 01:44:13,526
Who the hell are they?

1466
01:44:13,734 --> 01:44:16,100
They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

1467
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:22,334
Eddie, let me take a look
at that blotter.

1468
01:44:32,353 --> 01:44:34,719
We got a Muslim.
Relief must've put it down.

1469
01:44:34,922 --> 01:44:36,913
-Must have.
-But you can't see him.

1470
01:44:37,124 --> 01:44:40,059
-Because you ain't his lawyer.
-No lawyer, no see.

1471
01:44:40,261 --> 01:44:44,630
Until l'm satisfied that Johnson
is receiving proper medical care...

1472
01:44:44,832 --> 01:44:46,493
...nobody will move.

1473
01:45:01,549 --> 01:45:03,517
Get an ambulance. Now!

1474
01:45:22,169 --> 01:45:24,262
Break it up. You got what you wanted.

1475
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:26,940
No, l'm not satisfied.

1476
01:45:27,975 --> 01:45:28,873
To the hospital.

1477
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:31,792
We want justice!
We want justice!

1478
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,967
All right, that's enough.

1479
01:47:34,168 --> 01:47:35,829
Move these people out of here.

1480
01:47:36,036 --> 01:47:40,530
Fruit of lslam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws...yet.

1481
01:47:40,741 --> 01:47:41,639
What about them?

1482
01:47:41,842 --> 01:47:43,434
That's your headache.

1483
01:47:43,644 --> 01:47:45,874
But if Brother Johnson dies,
l pity you.

1484
01:47:47,314 --> 01:47:48,281
Doctor?

1485
01:47:48,482 --> 01:47:50,950
He'll live. He's getting
the best care we have.

1486
01:47:51,152 --> 01:47:52,278
-Thank you.
-Certainly.

1487
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,081
All right, okay.

1488
01:47:55,489 --> 01:47:57,150
Now, let's disperse this mob!

1489
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:52,911
That's too much power
for one man to have.

1490
01:48:53,113 --> 01:48:56,173
Brother Minister, l'm ready
to take some heads.

1491
01:48:56,383 --> 01:48:58,613
We gotta do something
to put fear in those devils.

1492
01:48:58,819 --> 01:49:03,085
l'm ready to do something also. The
word out of Chicago was to be patient.

1493
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:06,157
-l'm tired of being patient.
-Then you get on the phone--

1494
01:49:06,961 --> 01:49:10,226
You get on the phone, call Chicago
and let Mr. Muhammad know.

1495
01:49:27,481 --> 01:49:28,948
Have a seat, son.

1496
01:49:32,586 --> 01:49:34,850
The only thing l like integrated...

1497
01:49:36,357 --> 01:49:37,187
...is my coffee.

1498
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,884
What can l do for you?

1499
01:49:44,231 --> 01:49:45,858
Well, Mr. X...

1500
01:49:47,234 --> 01:49:48,861
...my name is Benjamin.

1501
01:49:49,436 --> 01:49:51,427
l was out there tonight.

1502
01:49:51,939 --> 01:49:53,372
Take it easy now.

1503
01:49:53,741 --> 01:49:56,209
And l saw what it is that you did.

1504
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:59,174
The way you talked
to them policeman and all.

1505
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:05,040
Well, Mr. X...

1506
01:50:07,655 --> 01:50:09,520
...l want to be a Muslim.

1507
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:12,620
l ain't never seen a nigger--
l mean...

1508
01:50:12,893 --> 01:50:14,224
...colored person--

1509
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:17,222
Negro...

1510
01:50:18,232 --> 01:50:20,530
...talk to no police like that before.

1511
01:50:20,734 --> 01:50:23,669
And you want to be Muslim?
Join the Nation Of lslam?

1512
01:50:23,871 --> 01:50:26,772
You know what that means?
To be a Muslim?

1513
01:50:28,876 --> 01:50:30,002
Do you?

1514
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:36,549
No, not exactly.
But l wanna be one.

1515
01:50:36,917 --> 01:50:37,975
Just like you.

1516
01:50:38,185 --> 01:50:42,144
You shouldn't join any organization
unless you know what it's about.

1517
01:50:48,829 --> 01:50:50,126
Thank you.

1518
01:50:51,799 --> 01:50:54,131
You shouldn't give up
so easily either.

1519
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:59,435
We could use more young warriors
like yourself.

1520
01:50:59,673 --> 01:51:02,107
Come on by the temple
next Wednesday, 8:00.

1521
01:51:02,343 --> 01:51:03,537
8:00 sharp.

1522
01:51:03,744 --> 01:51:05,575
Yes, sir. 8:00 sharp.

1523
01:51:05,779 --> 01:51:09,078
Thank you, Mr. X. And l won't
make you out a liar either.

1524
01:51:09,283 --> 01:51:10,511
l don't think you will.

1525
01:51:23,697 --> 01:51:25,130
Tonight, l shall...

1526
01:51:25,632 --> 01:51:29,591
...introduce you
as my national minister.

1527
01:51:30,838 --> 01:51:33,306
lt will be a difficult task.

1528
01:51:33,707 --> 01:51:35,299
Your assignment...

1529
01:51:36,143 --> 01:51:38,805
...is to build temples
all over this nation.

1530
01:51:39,913 --> 01:51:42,006
More work than you've ever done.

1531
01:51:42,216 --> 01:51:43,274
Yes, sir.

1532
01:51:43,484 --> 01:51:45,509
You will be in the public eye.

1533
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:48,347
Beware of them cameras.

1534
01:51:50,724 --> 01:51:52,055
Them cameras are...

1535
01:51:52,826 --> 01:51:55,056
...bad as any narcotic.

1536
01:51:57,998 --> 01:52:00,694
White devil will be watching
your every step.

1537
01:52:01,335 --> 01:52:03,803
And your own brothers will be...

1538
01:52:04,905 --> 01:52:06,338
...jealous...

1539
01:52:07,007 --> 01:52:08,736
...hostile.

1540
01:52:09,676 --> 01:52:10,973
Go slowly.

1541
01:52:11,278 --> 01:52:12,404
Yes, sir.

1542
01:52:13,747 --> 01:52:15,180
Here's a glass.

1543
01:52:21,989 --> 01:52:23,957
lt's dirty water.

1544
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:25,250
Foul.

1545
01:52:27,061 --> 01:52:29,495
lf you offer this to the people...

1546
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,527
...they have no choice.

1547
01:52:31,965 --> 01:52:33,432
They'll drink from it...

1548
01:52:34,401 --> 01:52:35,959
...if they're thirsty.

1549
01:52:36,904 --> 01:52:38,735
But if you offer them...

1550
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:41,235
...this glass...

1551
01:52:44,044 --> 01:52:47,275
...and let them make
their own decision...

1552
01:52:48,115 --> 01:52:51,380
...they will choose the pure vessel.

1553
01:52:53,387 --> 01:52:54,854
lslam is...

1554
01:52:55,289 --> 01:52:57,553
...the only religion...

1555
01:52:58,725 --> 01:53:01,853
...that addresses
the needs and the problems...

1556
01:53:02,062 --> 01:53:06,294
...of the so-called Negro in America.
Especially in the slums...

1557
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,899
...in the ghettos.

1558
01:53:08,602 --> 01:53:12,698
lslam is the only way out
for drugs and crime...

1559
01:53:12,906 --> 01:53:15,101
...and unemployment, prostitution...

1560
01:53:15,309 --> 01:53:16,936
...alcohol...

1561
01:53:17,144 --> 01:53:18,543
...gambling...

1562
01:53:18,745 --> 01:53:21,009
...and adultery, fornication.

1563
01:53:22,316 --> 01:53:23,408
This sweet...

1564
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:27,984
...gentle man, at whose feet I kneeled,
gave me the truth from his own mouth.

1565
01:53:28,255 --> 01:53:29,449
Present the pure vessel.

1566
01:53:29,656 --> 01:53:33,990
I adored him in the sense of
the Latin root of the word adorare...

1567
01:53:34,194 --> 01:53:36,253
...which means to worship and to fear.

1568
01:53:36,797 --> 01:53:38,628
He was the first man I ever feared.

1569
01:53:38,832 --> 01:53:41,460
I don't mean fear
such as one has of a gun...

1570
01:53:41,668 --> 01:53:45,468
...but the fear one has
of the power of the sun.

1571
01:53:45,772 --> 01:53:49,071
I pledged myself to him,
even if it cost me my life.

1572
01:53:52,546 --> 01:53:54,309
-Hello?
-Hello, Betty?

1573
01:53:54,615 --> 01:53:55,843
Yeah, this is Malcolm.

1574
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,912
-l know.
-Right, I'm here in Detroit.

1575
01:54:03,023 --> 01:54:05,150
-Will you marry me?
-Yes.

1576
01:54:05,559 --> 01:54:06,992
You heard what I said, right?

1577
01:54:07,194 --> 01:54:09,594
-Did you hear my answer?
-Yes, l think so.

1578
01:54:12,132 --> 01:54:14,794
-Are you eating?
-l've been eating.

1579
01:54:15,035 --> 01:54:16,093
Good.

1580
01:54:16,837 --> 01:54:18,202
I love you, Betty.

1581
01:54:20,807 --> 01:54:22,798
I love you back.

1582
01:54:33,086 --> 01:54:34,485
lt's not gonna be easy.

1583
01:54:34,688 --> 01:54:36,212
No choice.

1584
01:54:36,723 --> 01:54:38,315
l'll be away a lot.

1585
01:54:39,159 --> 01:54:40,421
l know.

1586
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:45,198
ln fact, l'm leaving in the morning.

1587
01:54:45,399 --> 01:54:46,889
Hush, now.

1588
01:54:47,734 --> 01:54:49,895
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia...

1589
01:54:51,572 --> 01:54:55,338
...Trenton, Newark, up through number 7
all the way up to Boston.

1590
01:55:02,115 --> 01:55:03,810
You're with me...

1591
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:07,086
...even when you're away.

1592
01:55:23,604 --> 01:55:25,936
l've never told you this...

1593
01:55:28,542 --> 01:55:31,375
...but the very first time
l ever saw you...

1594
01:55:32,446 --> 01:55:34,539
...standing up on the podium...

1595
01:55:37,150 --> 01:55:39,380
...you were cleaning your glasses...

1596
01:55:42,055 --> 01:55:44,785
...and l felt so sorry for you.

1597
01:55:45,726 --> 01:55:47,057
Sorry for me?

1598
01:55:47,527 --> 01:55:48,391
Why?

1599
01:55:48,595 --> 01:55:53,225
Because no one as young as you
should be so serious.

1600
01:55:56,203 --> 01:55:58,228
But l don't think that anymore.

1601
01:55:58,872 --> 01:56:00,237
What do you think?

1602
01:56:03,243 --> 01:56:06,144
l want to have
a lot of babies with you.

1603
01:56:09,916 --> 01:56:11,406
Dear heart.

1604
01:56:13,987 --> 01:56:15,420
l love you.

1605
01:56:17,658 --> 01:56:20,559
We're waiting on you folks.
Trying to starve us?

1606
01:56:23,997 --> 01:56:26,124
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty...

1607
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:30,861
...we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and fruitful marriage.

1608
01:56:33,874 --> 01:56:36,206
Congratulations, Brother Minister.

1609
01:56:38,512 --> 01:56:40,776
Check them out. Front page!

1610
01:56:45,285 --> 01:56:50,154
l must emphasize at the start that
Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.

1611
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:55,626
So l'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican nor as a Democrat.

1612
01:56:57,197 --> 01:56:59,859
Not as a Mason nor as an Elk.

1613
01:57:01,201 --> 01:57:03,931
Not as a Protestant nor a Catholic.

1614
01:57:04,137 --> 01:57:06,833
Not as a Christian nor a Jew.

1615
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,372
Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist.

1616
01:57:09,576 --> 01:57:11,976
ln fact, not even as an American.

1617
01:57:12,713 --> 01:57:14,806
Because if l was an American...

1618
01:57:15,048 --> 01:57:18,677
...the problem that confronts our people
today wouldn't even exist.

1619
01:57:22,089 --> 01:57:25,525
So l have to stand here today
as what l was when l was born...

1620
01:57:25,826 --> 01:57:27,384
...a black man.

1621
01:57:31,998 --> 01:57:36,697
Before there was any such thing as a
Republican or a Democrat, we were black.

1622
01:57:36,903 --> 01:57:40,703
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

1623
01:57:40,907 --> 01:57:45,139
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

1624
01:57:45,345 --> 01:57:49,714
ln fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

1625
01:57:49,983 --> 01:57:53,475
And after America has long passed
from the scene...

1626
01:57:53,687 --> 01:57:56,155
...there will still be black people.

1627
01:57:57,190 --> 01:57:59,852
l'm gonna tell you like it really is!

1628
01:58:00,594 --> 01:58:05,395
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us.

1629
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,397
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man.

1630
01:58:08,602 --> 01:58:09,899
This is what they do.

1631
01:58:10,103 --> 01:58:13,004
They send drugs in Harlem down here
to pacify us!

1632
01:58:13,206 --> 01:58:15,902
They send alcohol down here
to pacify us!

1633
01:58:16,109 --> 01:58:19,078
They send prostitution down here
to pacify us!

1634
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:22,680
You can't get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1635
01:58:22,883 --> 01:58:26,182
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1636
01:58:26,386 --> 01:58:29,549
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission.

1637
01:58:29,756 --> 01:58:32,589
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle...

1638
01:58:32,793 --> 01:58:35,353
...that's a government seal
you're breaking.

1639
01:58:35,562 --> 01:58:39,430
l say, and l say it again,
you been had.

1640
01:58:39,633 --> 01:58:41,157
You been took.

1641
01:58:41,368 --> 01:58:42,960
You been hoodwinked.

1642
01:58:43,303 --> 01:58:45,897
Bamboozled. Led astray.

1643
01:58:46,139 --> 01:58:48,630
Run amuck. This is what he does.

1644
01:58:48,909 --> 01:58:51,605
You know, some people
call this hate-teaching.

1645
01:58:51,945 --> 01:58:53,913
This isn't hate-teaching.

1646
01:58:54,114 --> 01:58:55,741
This is love-teaching.

1647
01:58:56,349 --> 01:58:58,874
l wouldn't tell you this
if l didn't love you.

1648
01:58:59,085 --> 01:59:01,883
l wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if l didn't love you.

1649
01:59:02,088 --> 01:59:04,955
l want you to understand one thing:
Everything l teach you...

1650
01:59:05,158 --> 01:59:07,217
...everything l have said to you...

1651
01:59:07,427 --> 01:59:10,419
...has been taught to me
by this dear man.

1652
01:59:10,664 --> 01:59:11,926
This divine man.

1653
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,992
All praise is due to Allah
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1654
01:59:17,671 --> 01:59:19,502
Attallah's fine.

1655
01:59:19,706 --> 01:59:22,266
And she misses you as much as I do.

1656
01:59:22,676 --> 01:59:26,908
But the news that you've dedicated
four new temples is almost as good...

1657
01:59:27,113 --> 01:59:30,480
...as having you with us.
Oh, dear heart.

1658
01:59:30,684 --> 01:59:35,485
--white supremacy, try to hide their
guilt by accusing Elijah Muhammad...

1659
01:59:35,689 --> 01:59:37,316
...of being a black supremacist...

1660
01:59:37,524 --> 01:59:40,322
...simply because he's trying
to uplift the mentality...

1661
01:59:40,527 --> 01:59:43,360
...the social and economic condition
of his people.

1662
01:59:43,563 --> 01:59:47,659
And the Jews who have been guilty
of exploiting black people...

1663
01:59:47,868 --> 01:59:51,133
...try to hide their guilt
by accusing Elijah Muhammad...

1664
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:53,430
...of being anti-Semitic...

1665
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:57,041
...simply because he's trying
to teach you and l--

1666
01:59:57,244 --> 01:59:59,235
He's trying to teach you and I...

1667
01:59:59,446 --> 02:00:02,609
...to be in charge of the businesses
in our own community.

1668
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:05,512
To own the businesses
in our own community.

1669
02:00:05,719 --> 02:00:08,381
To have economic leadership
in our own community.

1670
02:00:09,289 --> 02:00:11,189
No, this isn't black supremacy...

1671
02:00:11,391 --> 02:00:13,757
...this is black intelligence.

1672
02:00:30,644 --> 02:00:32,942
The black people in this country...

1673
02:00:33,346 --> 02:00:35,746
...have been the victims
of violence...

1674
02:00:36,249 --> 02:00:38,843
...at the hands
of the American right wing...

1675
02:00:39,052 --> 02:00:42,180
...for 400 years.

1676
02:00:42,589 --> 02:00:44,682
Four hundred years.

1677
02:00:45,258 --> 02:00:47,021
Four hundred years.

1678
02:00:49,329 --> 02:00:52,423
We thought by following
those ignorant Negro preachers...

1679
02:00:52,632 --> 02:00:55,100
...that it was God-like
to turn the other cheek...

1680
02:00:55,302 --> 02:00:57,793
...to the group
that was brutalizing us.

1681
02:00:58,204 --> 02:01:01,901
A hundred years ago,
they used to put on white sheets...

1682
02:01:02,108 --> 02:01:04,235
...and sic bloodhounds on us.

1683
02:01:04,444 --> 02:01:06,844
Nowadays, they've traded in
the sheets--

1684
02:01:07,047 --> 02:01:08,776
Some have traded in the sheets--

1685
02:01:10,116 --> 02:01:12,175
They've traded in the sheets--

1686
02:01:12,385 --> 02:01:13,750
Please, please.

1687
02:01:13,954 --> 02:01:17,287
They've traded in those white sheets
for police uniforms.

1688
02:01:17,624 --> 02:01:20,718
They traded in the bloodhounds
for police dogs.

1689
02:01:20,927 --> 02:01:23,589
Andjust like Uncle Tom
back during slavery time....

1690
02:01:23,797 --> 02:01:28,291
We must remain true to nonviolence.
I'm asking everybody in the line.

1691
02:01:28,635 --> 02:01:31,229
If you can't be nonviolent,
don't get in it.

1692
02:01:31,438 --> 02:01:34,430
--to love our enemy and pray
for those who use us spitefully.

1693
02:01:34,641 --> 02:01:38,805
You've got chicken-pecking Uncle Tom,
so-called Negro leaders today.

1694
02:01:39,012 --> 02:01:41,105
And it's another great day.

1695
02:01:41,314 --> 02:01:45,080
You've got these Uncle Tom
Negro leaders today...

1696
02:01:45,285 --> 02:01:47,879
...that tell us we ought to pray
for our enemies.

1697
02:01:48,088 --> 02:01:51,148
We ought to love our enemy
and integrate with the enemy...

1698
02:01:51,358 --> 02:01:54,953
...who bombs us, who kills
and shoots us, who lynches us...

1699
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:58,062
...who rapes our women
and children. No!

1700
02:02:00,433 --> 02:02:02,492
No! That's not intelligent.

1701
02:02:02,769 --> 02:02:04,566
That's not intelligent.

1702
02:02:04,771 --> 02:02:07,467
Elijah Muhammad is trying
to teach you and l...

1703
02:02:07,674 --> 02:02:11,007
...that just as the white man
and any other man on this earth...

1704
02:02:11,211 --> 02:02:14,647
...has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right...

1705
02:02:14,848 --> 02:02:17,783
...the natural right, and any other
rights you can think of...

1706
02:02:18,018 --> 02:02:19,747
...to protect himself...

1707
02:02:19,953 --> 02:02:23,514
...just as this white man has
the right to defend himself...

1708
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:26,520
...we have the right
to defend ourselves too.

1709
02:02:27,093 --> 02:02:31,462
This is only natural. This is what
Elijah Muhammad is trying to teach.

1710
02:02:31,665 --> 02:02:33,656
He's not teaching us
to hate the white man.

1711
02:02:33,867 --> 02:02:36,358
He's teaching us to love ourselves.

1712
02:02:37,537 --> 02:02:41,564
Mr. X, before we begin
our discussion tonight...

1713
02:02:41,775 --> 02:02:45,108
... "The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"...

1714
02:02:45,812 --> 02:02:49,373
...would you mind explaining for us
the meaning of your name...

1715
02:02:49,582 --> 02:02:52,016
...which is the letter "X"?

1716
02:02:52,652 --> 02:02:55,519
During slavery time,
the slave master...

1717
02:02:55,722 --> 02:02:58,247
...gave the Negro--
the so-called Negro...

1718
02:02:58,458 --> 02:03:01,621
...named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

1719
02:03:02,729 --> 02:03:04,458
Elijah Muhammad teaches us...

1720
02:03:04,664 --> 02:03:08,361
...that once we come into the knowledge
of lslam, the knowledge of ourselves...

1721
02:03:08,568 --> 02:03:11,196
...we replace our slave name
with an "X" ...

1722
02:03:11,404 --> 02:03:14,305
..."X" in mathematics representing
the unknown.

1723
02:03:14,574 --> 02:03:17,668
Since we've been disconnected,
or cut off from our own history...

1724
02:03:17,877 --> 02:03:20,846
...our own past, our own culture,
our own land...

1725
02:03:21,047 --> 02:03:24,778
...we use the "X," the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

1726
02:03:24,984 --> 02:03:28,249
l see. Thank you. Dr. Payson?

1727
02:03:28,455 --> 02:03:31,117
Mr. X is a....
He's a demagogue.

1728
02:03:31,324 --> 02:03:34,088
He has no place to go,
so he exaggerates.

1729
02:03:34,327 --> 02:03:35,555
He's a disservice to...

1730
02:03:35,762 --> 02:03:39,596
...every good, law-abiding, church-going
American Negro in the country.

1731
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:46,798
Why do you teach black supremacy?

1732
02:03:47,006 --> 02:03:48,940
Why do you teach hate?

1733
02:03:49,142 --> 02:03:51,610
Well, for the white man...

1734
02:03:51,811 --> 02:03:54,279
...to ask the black man...

1735
02:03:54,781 --> 02:03:56,214
...why he hates him...

1736
02:03:56,449 --> 02:04:00,351
...is like the wolf asking the sheep,
or the rapist asking the raped...

1737
02:04:00,553 --> 02:04:01,577
..."Do you hate me?"

1738
02:04:01,788 --> 02:04:05,417
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

1739
02:04:05,625 --> 02:04:07,593
This is a black man
asking the question.

1740
02:04:07,794 --> 02:04:11,958
What would you call an educated Negro
with a B.A., an M.A., a B.S. or a Ph.D.?

1741
02:04:12,165 --> 02:04:15,623
You call him a nigger.
That's what the white man calls him.

1742
02:04:15,835 --> 02:04:18,030
You have to understand this thinking.

1743
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:21,867
To understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically...

1744
02:04:22,075 --> 02:04:25,738
...there were two types of slaves:
The house Negro and the field Negro.

1745
02:04:25,945 --> 02:04:27,742
The house Negro lived in the house...

1746
02:04:27,947 --> 02:04:31,610
...next to his master. ln the big house,
in the basement or the attic.

1747
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:34,581
He dressed good, he ate good,
what the master left him.

1748
02:04:34,788 --> 02:04:36,415
He loved his master.

1749
02:04:36,623 --> 02:04:39,820
He loved his master better
than the master loved himself.

1750
02:04:40,026 --> 02:04:44,326
lf master said, "We got a nice house,"
you say, "Yeah, we got a nice house."

1751
02:04:44,697 --> 02:04:47,063
Master's house caught on fire,
the house Negro...

1752
02:04:47,534 --> 02:04:48,796
...would put the blaze out.

1753
02:04:49,002 --> 02:04:52,335
lf the master got sick, he'd say,
"What's the matter? We sick?"

1754
02:04:52,739 --> 02:04:55,401
"We sick" ! This is the thinking
of the house Negro.

1755
02:04:55,608 --> 02:04:57,337
lf another slave said...

1756
02:04:57,544 --> 02:05:00,411
..."Let's run away, let's separate
from this cruel master" ...

1757
02:05:00,613 --> 02:05:03,548
...he said, "Why? What's better
than what we got here?

1758
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:06,184
l'm not going anywhere."
This is the house Negro.

1759
02:05:06,386 --> 02:05:08,217
ln those days, we called them
house niggers.

1760
02:05:08,421 --> 02:05:12,482
That's what we call them today because
we still got a lot of house niggers.

1761
02:05:13,426 --> 02:05:14,586
Dear Holy Apostle...

1762
02:05:16,429 --> 02:05:19,694
...the ministers think Malcolm is
getting too much press.

1763
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,628
They think he thinks he is
the Nation of lslam.

1764
02:05:25,505 --> 02:05:28,167
That he has aspirations
to lead the Nation.

1765
02:05:29,242 --> 02:05:32,143
lt was you who made Malcolm
the man he is.

1766
02:05:32,345 --> 02:05:33,835
You lifted him out of darkness.

1767
02:05:37,450 --> 02:05:40,078
You go and tell the brothers...

1768
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:42,549
...that what the Brother Minister...

1769
02:05:42,922 --> 02:05:44,787
...is doing, has done...

1770
02:05:45,091 --> 02:05:49,494
...has been of great benefit
to the Nation.

1771
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:51,687
And you tell them that l say so.

1772
02:05:51,898 --> 02:05:54,526
The ministers think he is
of great benefit to himself.

1773
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:05,174
One at a time.

1774
02:06:05,378 --> 02:06:08,438
-Did you say white people are devils?
-I said they're devils.

1775
02:06:08,648 --> 02:06:10,411
Should all black men be armed?

1776
02:06:10,617 --> 02:06:12,983
Well, one of your most
famous men said:

1777
02:06:13,186 --> 02:06:16,713
"Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition." That's the way you think.

1778
02:06:16,923 --> 02:06:19,255
Do you think your cause
will be successful?

1779
02:06:19,459 --> 02:06:20,790
I sincerely hope so.

1780
02:06:20,994 --> 02:06:23,292
-Do you advocate violence?
-No, sir.

1781
02:06:23,496 --> 02:06:25,691
Has a white man helped your people?

1782
02:06:25,899 --> 02:06:28,459
Has there been a white man
that's helped my people?

1783
02:06:28,668 --> 02:06:30,863
-Correct.
-I don't understand the question.

1784
02:06:31,070 --> 02:06:33,231
You preach anti-white,
anti-Christian science.

1785
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:35,339
You're saying you're anti-white?

1786
02:06:35,541 --> 02:06:38,510
-No, you're saying it.
-Are all white people devils?

1787
02:06:39,145 --> 02:06:42,603
We've gotta move out.
We've got a plane to catch.

1788
02:06:45,184 --> 02:06:47,516
Excuse me, Mr. X?

1789
02:06:48,221 --> 02:06:50,121
l've read some of your speeches...

1790
02:06:50,323 --> 02:06:54,054
...and l honestly believe that a lot
of what you have to say is true.

1791
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:57,320
l'm a good person in spite
of what my ancestors did.

1792
02:06:57,530 --> 02:06:59,589
l just wanted to ask you...

1793
02:06:59,799 --> 02:07:02,666
...what can a white person
like me, who isn't prejudiced...

1794
02:07:02,869 --> 02:07:06,430
...what can l do to help you
and further your cause?

1795
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:07,731
Nothing.

1796
02:07:15,281 --> 02:07:17,681
My high school was a black ghetto...

1797
02:07:17,884 --> 02:07:20,045
...in Roxbury, right here in Boston.

1798
02:07:20,887 --> 02:07:24,482
I got my college education on
the streets of Harlem in New York City.

1799
02:07:25,325 --> 02:07:27,850
l took my master's degree in prison...

1800
02:07:28,294 --> 02:07:29,852
...over six and a half years.

1801
02:07:30,063 --> 02:07:31,291
ln fact...

1802
02:07:31,497 --> 02:07:35,160
...my old burglary hangout
was just outside this campus.

1803
02:07:35,935 --> 02:07:37,402
l lived like an animal.

1804
02:07:38,338 --> 02:07:39,737
l stole.

1805
02:07:40,073 --> 02:07:41,870
l used drugs.

1806
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:45,901
l smoked reefers, cocaine.

1807
02:07:46,112 --> 02:07:49,912
l committed adultery. Had it not been
for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad...

1808
02:07:50,683 --> 02:07:53,516
...l'd have surely been in
an insane asylum or dead...

1809
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:56,450
...or possibly even a murderer
of one of you.

1810
02:07:56,656 --> 02:08:00,888
So what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side...

1811
02:08:01,127 --> 02:08:04,790
...so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

1812
02:08:04,998 --> 02:08:07,831
When the so-called Negro in America
gets on God's side...

1813
02:08:08,034 --> 02:08:10,628
...and listens to the teachings
of Elijah Muhammad...

1814
02:08:10,837 --> 02:08:14,273
...he'll want to get off of drugs
and get away from a life of crime.

1815
02:08:14,474 --> 02:08:17,136
He'll want to get away
from committing adultery.

1816
02:08:17,343 --> 02:08:20,244
Then he'd want to get off welfare.
He'd want a job...

1817
02:08:20,446 --> 02:08:24,007
...to take care of his family.
And his family would respect him.

1818
02:08:24,217 --> 02:08:26,685
His son will say,
"l'm proud that that's my father."

1819
02:08:26,886 --> 02:08:29,616
His wife will say,
"l'm proud that that's my husband."

1820
02:08:29,822 --> 02:08:34,452
"Father" only means that you take care
of your children. That's what it is.

1821
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:37,652
"Father" doesn't mean
that you're having some babies.

1822
02:08:37,864 --> 02:08:39,422
That doesn't make you a father.

1823
02:08:39,632 --> 02:08:41,395
Anybody can go out and get a woman.

1824
02:08:41,601 --> 02:08:44,570
But not anybody can take care
of that woman.

1825
02:08:44,771 --> 02:08:47,501
There's another word for it.
lt's called responsibility.

1826
02:08:48,074 --> 02:08:52,534
lf the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen...

1827
02:08:52,745 --> 02:08:54,713
...we wouldn't have a racial problem.

1828
02:08:54,914 --> 02:08:57,974
lf the Emancipation Proclamation
was authentic...

1829
02:08:58,518 --> 02:09:00,816
...if the 1 3th, 1 4th and 1 5th
amendments...

1830
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:03,750
...were authentic,
we wouldn't have a race problem.

1831
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:06,959
lf the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic...

1832
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:08,650
...we wouldn't have a race problem.

1833
02:09:09,395 --> 02:09:12,387
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy.

1834
02:09:12,598 --> 02:09:15,328
These Negro leaders are telling
the white man...

1835
02:09:15,535 --> 02:09:18,368
...that everything's all right,
we got it under control.

1836
02:09:18,571 --> 02:09:21,233
That everything Elijah Muhammad
teaches is wrong.

1837
02:09:21,441 --> 02:09:24,933
Mr. Muhammad said these things
were gonna come to pass...

1838
02:09:25,144 --> 02:09:27,009
...and now they're coming to pass.

1839
02:09:29,816 --> 02:09:32,512
Now these same Negro leaders...

1840
02:09:33,653 --> 02:09:38,283
...are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion.

1841
02:09:40,193 --> 02:09:42,787
Yes, there's gonna be
a racial explosion.

1842
02:09:43,262 --> 02:09:47,790
And a racial explosion is
more dangerous than an atomic explosion.

1843
02:09:49,469 --> 02:09:53,599
There's going to be an explosion because
black people are dissatisfied...

1844
02:09:53,806 --> 02:09:58,004
...not only with the white man, but with
these Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

1845
02:09:58,211 --> 02:10:00,076
...that try to pose
as spokesmen...

1846
02:10:00,279 --> 02:10:01,746
...for you and l.

1847
02:10:02,181 --> 02:10:03,375
Just like you have a--

1848
02:10:04,183 --> 02:10:05,912
Just like you have a powder keg.

1849
02:10:06,252 --> 02:10:08,812
When you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks...

1850
02:10:09,021 --> 02:10:10,648
...the thing's going to explode.

1851
02:10:10,857 --> 02:10:14,623
lf the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house...

1852
02:10:14,827 --> 02:10:17,819
...and if it explodes, then the house
is going to be destroyed.

1853
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:20,863
l said the house is going
to be destroyed.

1854
02:10:21,067 --> 02:10:23,627
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
teaching you and l...

1855
02:10:23,836 --> 02:10:27,795
...and trying to tell the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house.

1856
02:10:28,141 --> 02:10:30,473
Let the black man separate
from his house.

1857
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:32,678
Let the black man have his own house.

1858
02:10:32,879 --> 02:10:35,643
Let the black man have
his own land and property.

1859
02:10:38,551 --> 02:10:41,543
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is
trying to tell the white man...

1860
02:10:41,754 --> 02:10:45,690
...that this thing, this explosion, is
gonna bring down his house.

1861
02:10:45,892 --> 02:10:49,350
This is what he's telling him.
More importantly, he's telling him...

1862
02:10:49,562 --> 02:10:51,553
...that if he doesn't do
something about it...

1863
02:10:51,764 --> 02:10:56,701
...if he doesn't do something about it,
it's gonna explode any day now.

1864
02:10:57,036 --> 02:11:00,301
l'm just here to tell you,
and l'm gonna make it very short.

1865
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:04,776
l'm here to tell you about
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

1866
02:11:05,111 --> 02:11:08,342
His greatest greatness is
that he has the only solution...

1867
02:11:08,548 --> 02:11:10,607
...for peace in this country.

1868
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:13,541
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad's
solution...

1869
02:11:13,753 --> 02:11:15,880
...is the only solution for you and l.

1870
02:11:16,088 --> 02:11:18,716
lt's the only solution
for the white man.

1871
02:11:19,959 --> 02:11:22,393
Complete separation...

1872
02:11:22,728 --> 02:11:26,220
...between the black race
and the white race.

1873
02:11:28,834 --> 02:11:30,699
lt's the only solution.

1874
02:11:37,076 --> 02:11:39,306
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

1875
02:11:39,512 --> 02:11:41,844
All praise due to Allah
for Elijah Muhammad!

1876
02:12:17,683 --> 02:12:19,446
Brother Malcolm!

1877
02:12:20,286 --> 02:12:23,016
Yes, yes. Hold on, hold on.

1878
02:12:23,856 --> 02:12:27,155
Yes, sir. lt's all right.
My brother. How you doing?

1879
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:29,419
-Can l ask you something?
-Anything.

1880
02:12:29,629 --> 02:12:31,426
Are you Elijah's pimp?

1881
02:12:31,631 --> 02:12:34,293
He should be killed
for talking like that!

1882
02:12:35,534 --> 02:12:37,126
What are you saying, brother?

1883
02:12:37,637 --> 02:12:39,264
"His greatest greatness."

1884
02:12:39,472 --> 02:12:41,235
Just say what you're saying.

1885
02:12:43,042 --> 02:12:44,737
lf you don't know...

1886
02:12:45,077 --> 02:12:46,476
...l feel the sorriest for you.

1887
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:48,704
Oh, come on, brother.

1888
02:12:49,882 --> 02:12:51,645
Let me tell you something.

1889
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:02,057
lt's all right.

1890
02:13:06,165 --> 02:13:08,690
He's just hungry for knowledge,
that's all.

1891
02:13:08,901 --> 02:13:11,062
Yeah, that brother's starving.

1892
02:13:11,404 --> 02:13:14,066
So am l. Come on,
let's get something to eat.

1893
02:13:15,675 --> 02:13:17,302
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

1894
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:20,035
-Okay, night-night, Daddy.
-Night-night.

1895
02:13:35,594 --> 02:13:36,788
Long night.

1896
02:13:44,003 --> 02:13:45,800
-What you looking at?
-You.

1897
02:13:46,005 --> 02:13:47,472
Why you looking like that?

1898
02:13:47,673 --> 02:13:48,935
You're in trouble.

1899
02:13:51,177 --> 02:13:52,166
How do you know?

1900
02:13:52,378 --> 02:13:54,437
Oh, dear heart.

1901
02:13:55,081 --> 02:13:56,378
Because l know you.

1902
02:13:56,582 --> 02:13:58,277
Well, if you know me...

1903
02:14:00,119 --> 02:14:02,986
...you know l don't like to bring
my troubles home.

1904
02:14:04,623 --> 02:14:06,113
You know that also.

1905
02:14:08,961 --> 02:14:10,121
Yes, l do.

1906
02:14:12,598 --> 02:14:14,657
But l'm not made of glass.

1907
02:14:14,867 --> 02:14:16,858
And l won't break.

1908
02:14:24,343 --> 02:14:26,573
Look, Betty, l just want peace.

1909
02:14:28,114 --> 02:14:30,378
l want to sit here with you.
l want to...

1910
02:14:31,684 --> 02:14:34,744
...be still. l want peace in my house.

1911
02:14:38,424 --> 02:14:41,154
-Have we ever had a fight?
-Never.

1912
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:43,726
-Argument?
-Never had one, no.

1913
02:14:46,565 --> 02:14:48,226
We're gonna have one...

1914
02:14:49,535 --> 02:14:52,231
-...if you don't talk about it.
-Talk about what?

1915
02:14:52,438 --> 02:14:56,636
-The talk's everywhere.
-There's always gonna be talk.

1916
02:14:56,842 --> 02:15:00,175
Aren't they talking now about me trying
to take over the Nation?

1917
02:15:00,446 --> 02:15:03,506
Aren't they talking about
how we're getting rich...

1918
02:15:03,716 --> 02:15:05,547
...off the Nation of lslam?

1919
02:15:05,751 --> 02:15:08,515
-We could talk about that too.
-Let's talk about it.

1920
02:15:08,921 --> 02:15:10,718
lt's not just talk anymore.

1921
02:15:10,923 --> 02:15:14,324
"UPl: Elijah Muhammad, 67...

1922
02:15:14,527 --> 02:15:17,291
...leader of
the Black Muslim movement...

1923
02:15:17,496 --> 02:15:21,830
...today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries."

1924
02:15:22,034 --> 02:15:25,435
These are slanders. These are lies.
Don't you know that?

1925
02:15:25,638 --> 02:15:29,699
Don't you realize this is
the devil's newspaper?

1926
02:15:30,042 --> 02:15:32,101
He's trying to divide us.

1927
02:15:32,611 --> 02:15:36,775
Divide and conquer. He's trying
to bring down our leader.

1928
02:15:40,219 --> 02:15:41,550
"Both women...

1929
02:15:42,388 --> 02:15:46,017
...in their 20s, charge that
they had intimacy--"

1930
02:15:46,225 --> 02:15:49,092
"lntimacies with Mr. Muhammad--"

1931
02:15:57,369 --> 02:16:01,362
You think l'm not
aware of these accusations?

1932
02:16:01,574 --> 02:16:04,907
You think l'm not
aware of these vicious lies?

1933
02:16:07,012 --> 02:16:10,243
-Brother Baines and l discussed it today.
-Baines?

1934
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:12,044
ls he your friend?

1935
02:16:12,284 --> 02:16:13,114
What's wrong?

1936
02:16:13,319 --> 02:16:15,787
Nothing.
What's the matter with you?

1937
02:16:15,988 --> 02:16:19,549
Wake up! Are you so committed that
you've blinded yourself?

1938
02:16:19,758 --> 02:16:22,556
You're so dedicated,
you can't face the truth?

1939
02:16:22,761 --> 02:16:24,023
Baines?

1940
02:16:24,263 --> 02:16:27,699
He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

1941
02:16:27,933 --> 02:16:32,233
Ask him why your name hasn't
appeared in it for over a year.

1942
02:16:32,438 --> 02:16:36,067
-l'm not interested in publicity.
-You're in every other paper.

1943
02:16:36,275 --> 02:16:39,506
Our people know what l'm doing.

1944
02:16:39,712 --> 02:16:42,738
-But do you know what Baines is doing?
-Baines! Baines!

1945
02:16:42,948 --> 02:16:46,941
You're so blind!
Everyone can see but you!

1946
02:16:48,621 --> 02:16:52,057
Baines is the one who saved my life.

1947
02:16:52,258 --> 02:16:54,556
When l crawled in prison
like an animal...

1948
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:57,388
...he brought me to
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1949
02:16:57,596 --> 02:17:00,190
And Mr. Muhammad brought me
back from the dead--

1950
02:17:00,399 --> 02:17:02,424
A long time ago!
You've repaid them!

1951
02:17:02,635 --> 02:17:05,331
Don't you raise your voice
in my house!

1952
02:17:09,808 --> 02:17:11,298
Ask them.

1953
02:17:12,811 --> 02:17:15,609
Ask them why they have new cars,
houses and furniture.

1954
02:17:15,814 --> 02:17:18,374
ls that what this is about?
You want furniture?

1955
02:17:18,584 --> 02:17:20,882
-You want cars?
-What do we have?

1956
02:17:21,086 --> 02:17:23,077
What do we have, Malcolm?

1957
02:17:23,422 --> 02:17:25,413
Broken-down jalopy....

1958
02:17:26,525 --> 02:17:28,459
The clothes on our backs.

1959
02:17:28,794 --> 02:17:30,523
So l'll get you new clothes....

1960
02:17:30,729 --> 02:17:33,220
We don't even own our own home.

1961
02:17:33,432 --> 02:17:36,367
What about our children?
What about me?

1962
02:17:36,735 --> 02:17:38,726
We don't even own life insurance.

1963
02:17:38,938 --> 02:17:42,305
The Nation will support all of you
if anything happens to me--

1964
02:17:42,508 --> 02:17:43,497
Will they?

1965
02:17:44,677 --> 02:17:45,939
Are you sure?

1966
02:17:47,513 --> 02:17:48,844
Are you sure?

1967
02:17:49,848 --> 02:17:51,179
Are you sure?

1968
02:17:52,851 --> 02:17:54,512
Or are you blind?

1969
02:17:58,023 --> 02:17:59,012
All right.

1970
02:18:04,964 --> 02:18:06,864
l've got work to do, so....

1971
02:18:08,534 --> 02:18:10,525
There's always work to do.

1972
02:18:10,803 --> 02:18:12,600
-Help me.
-l'm trying to.

1973
02:18:12,805 --> 02:18:16,332
l'm raising the children
practically by myself.

1974
02:18:16,542 --> 02:18:19,170
What do you want me to do?
Stay home?

1975
02:18:19,378 --> 02:18:22,814
You don't know how often they ask,
"Where's Daddy?"

1976
02:18:23,015 --> 02:18:25,677
You want me to make the beds
and go on the road?

1977
02:18:25,884 --> 02:18:27,613
-The people need me!
-We need you!

1978
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:30,516
l need you too.
But what do you want me to do?

1979
02:18:30,723 --> 02:18:32,816
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

1980
02:18:33,692 --> 02:18:38,026
You can face death 24 hours a day,
but the possibility of betrayal...

1981
02:18:38,263 --> 02:18:40,390
...never enters your head.

1982
02:18:43,669 --> 02:18:45,569
Open your eyes.

1983
02:19:22,141 --> 02:19:25,042
-As-Salaam-Alaikum, minister
-Alaikum-Salaam, sister.

1984
02:19:25,244 --> 02:19:27,212
Her name's Eva Marie.

1985
02:19:28,213 --> 02:19:29,805
And she's 2 years old.

1986
02:19:31,383 --> 02:19:34,147
Brother Minister,
l didn't do anything wrong.

1987
02:19:34,386 --> 02:19:37,480
l didn't do anything to be
put in isolation.

1988
02:19:38,657 --> 02:19:40,488
l believed in him.

1989
02:19:41,894 --> 02:19:45,330
l believed in
the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1990
02:19:46,999 --> 02:19:48,557
Believe in Allah.

1991
02:19:53,172 --> 02:19:55,402
This is Saudi.
She's 2.

1992
02:19:55,741 --> 02:19:57,709
And you have Lisha.
She's 3.

1993
02:19:57,910 --> 02:20:02,643
From their own mouths I heard
who had fathered their children.

1994
02:20:03,182 --> 02:20:06,083
And from their own mouths
I heard that Mr. Muhammad...

1995
02:20:06,285 --> 02:20:08,412
...had told them I was the best.

1996
02:20:09,188 --> 02:20:11,748
He often spoke of you.
He loves you like a son.

1997
02:20:12,024 --> 02:20:15,152
The greatest minister he had,
but that I would leave him...

1998
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:18,625
...turn against him.
And so I was dangerous.

1999
02:20:18,831 --> 02:20:22,597
Mr. Muhammad, while praising me
to my face...

2000
02:20:23,335 --> 02:20:25,599
...was tearing me apart
behind by back.

2001
02:20:25,871 --> 02:20:28,169
-You're sure about all this?
-Yes, l am.

2002
02:20:28,407 --> 02:20:31,103
All l want is support for
my three children...

2003
02:20:31,543 --> 02:20:34,603
...that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them.

2004
02:20:34,947 --> 02:20:36,676
That's all l want.

2005
02:20:39,151 --> 02:20:41,176
Allah will provide...

2006
02:20:44,857 --> 02:20:45,881
...for all of us.

2007
02:20:46,125 --> 02:20:48,059
What do you mean, blackout?

2008
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:50,626
Perhaps some brothers are
a little jealous.

2009
02:20:51,396 --> 02:20:54,593
Maybe they think you've been
getting too much press.

2010
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:56,427
lt's nothing. Forget it.

2011
02:20:56,635 --> 02:20:59,195
Now about our coming
up in the world a little.

2012
02:20:59,404 --> 02:21:02,396
The Nation's grown.
We've grown with it.

2013
02:21:03,375 --> 02:21:04,899
You know our people.

2014
02:21:06,411 --> 02:21:08,709
They want their leaders
to be prosperous.

2015
02:21:09,815 --> 02:21:11,612
One hand washes the other.

2016
02:21:12,217 --> 02:21:15,414
"l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

2017
02:21:17,890 --> 02:21:19,949
Remember what you told me in prison?

2018
02:21:20,159 --> 02:21:23,993
"l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle."

2019
02:21:25,931 --> 02:21:27,159
Brother Malcolm...

2020
02:21:30,202 --> 02:21:32,568
...what do you want?
A new car?

2021
02:21:33,172 --> 02:21:34,605
A new house?

2022
02:21:36,141 --> 02:21:37,768
lt's the money, isn't it?

2023
02:21:42,848 --> 02:21:46,750
But we tell the whole world that
we're moral leaders...

2024
02:21:47,085 --> 02:21:48,848
...because we follow...

2025
02:21:49,521 --> 02:21:52,115
...the personal example of
Mr. Muhammad.

2026
02:21:52,324 --> 02:21:54,451
Elijah Muhammad is a human being...

2027
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:56,622
...and so are you.

2028
02:21:57,563 --> 02:21:59,326
-Do you know your Bible?
-Do you?

2029
02:21:59,698 --> 02:22:01,632
David slept with Bathsheba...

2030
02:22:01,834 --> 02:22:04,200
...but he's remembered for
slaying Goliath.

2031
02:22:05,871 --> 02:22:09,864
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

2032
02:22:11,176 --> 02:22:15,840
Solomon had 700 wives, but he
was history's greatest, wisest king.

2033
02:22:16,048 --> 02:22:19,779
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

2034
02:22:19,985 --> 02:22:22,920
A great man's deeds
outweigh his personal weaknesses.

2035
02:22:23,121 --> 02:22:25,453
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

2036
02:22:25,657 --> 02:22:28,182
-l'm not gonna allow--
-Be careful, Malcolm.

2037
02:22:30,162 --> 02:22:31,561
l warn you.

2038
02:22:32,564 --> 02:22:33,792
You be careful.

2039
02:23:03,161 --> 02:23:05,220
l'm not surprised.

2040
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:13,303
You have a very good understanding of
prophecy, of spiritual matters.

2041
02:23:13,505 --> 02:23:15,564
l'm not surprised.

2042
02:23:16,174 --> 02:23:18,870
l have built this Nation...

2043
02:23:19,077 --> 02:23:22,376
...under the divine guidance of Allah.

2044
02:23:23,181 --> 02:23:27,117
He has brought me back
from the dead to lead my people.

2045
02:23:27,319 --> 02:23:29,719
After me,
there will be no more.

2046
02:23:29,922 --> 02:23:31,685
No more.

2047
02:23:35,694 --> 02:23:37,525
l must...

2048
02:23:39,531 --> 02:23:42,796
...plant my seed in fertile soil.

2049
02:23:43,035 --> 02:23:44,468
lt is only...

2050
02:23:45,137 --> 02:23:48,129
...the fulfillment of prophecy.

2051
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:52,374
My faith had been shattered
in a way I can never fully describe.

2052
02:23:52,611 --> 02:23:55,375
Every second of my 12 years
with Mr. Muhammad...

2053
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:58,071
...I'd been ready to die for him.

2054
02:23:58,283 --> 02:24:01,912
The thing to me that is worse than
death itself is betrayal.

2055
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:06,022
I could conceive death,
but I couldn't conceive betrayal.

2056
02:24:06,224 --> 02:24:10,627
Not of the loyalty I gave to
the Nation of Islam and Mr. Muhammad.

2057
02:24:10,896 --> 02:24:14,195
During that time, if Mr. Muhammad
had committed any crime...

2058
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:18,267
...punishable by death, I would
have tried to prove I did it...

2059
02:24:18,470 --> 02:24:19,767
...to save him.

2060
02:24:19,972 --> 02:24:23,373
I would have gladly gone
to the electric chair in his place.

2061
02:24:39,758 --> 02:24:41,316
What did he say?

2062
02:24:48,633 --> 02:24:51,932
-l'm so sorry.
-There's nothing to be sorry about.

2063
02:24:52,604 --> 02:24:55,266
l just got a lot of work to do,
that's all.

2064
02:24:59,378 --> 02:25:00,743
How can you work?

2065
02:25:00,946 --> 02:25:03,176
Because we have to teach.

2066
02:25:03,682 --> 02:25:07,345
We gotta teach the people.
We gotta teach on Solomon, Moses...

2067
02:25:07,686 --> 02:25:10,621
...David.
Solomon had 700 wives.

2068
02:25:10,822 --> 02:25:14,223
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his....

2069
02:25:15,594 --> 02:25:17,619
My father used to say that...

2070
02:25:18,363 --> 02:25:21,093
...you can't make a rooster stop
crowing after sunrise.

2071
02:25:21,299 --> 02:25:22,960
Well, the sun is up.

2072
02:25:45,957 --> 02:25:50,690
So what do l say about this
so-called national day of mourning?

2073
02:25:51,063 --> 02:25:54,555
l say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned...

2074
02:25:54,766 --> 02:25:56,700
...by our beliefs and by his own.

2075
02:25:56,902 --> 02:25:59,700
The lKoran teaches us that
those who work evil...

2076
02:26:00,172 --> 02:26:04,632
...will be condemned, punished
or judged according to their works.

2077
02:26:04,843 --> 02:26:08,040
The Holy Bible teaches us that
you reap what you sow.

2078
02:26:08,246 --> 02:26:09,713
This is divinejustice.

2079
02:26:09,915 --> 02:26:13,749
ln the Americas' soil, the white man
has planted seeds of hatred...

2080
02:26:13,952 --> 02:26:15,852
...the seeds of violence.

2081
02:26:16,054 --> 02:26:18,648
He's allowed those weeds to choke...

2082
02:26:18,857 --> 02:26:22,418
...the lives of millions of black men
and women for 400 years...

2083
02:26:22,627 --> 02:26:25,926
...and the lives of lndians in these
Americas for 500 years.

2084
02:26:26,131 --> 02:26:28,224
And now those same weeds...

2085
02:26:28,433 --> 02:26:31,368
...have choked his own chief gardener.

2086
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:34,801
You ask me what l say.
l only say what the Bible says.

2087
02:26:35,073 --> 02:26:37,337
l say what the lKoran says.

2088
02:26:38,076 --> 02:26:39,771
l say it's justice.

2089
02:26:44,616 --> 02:26:49,553
Don't you even feel a bit remorseful
or saddened by lKennedy's assassination?

2090
02:26:50,088 --> 02:26:53,387
l don't think anyone would deny that
when you send chickens...

2091
02:26:53,592 --> 02:26:55,389
...out from the barnyard...

2092
02:26:55,594 --> 02:26:59,121
...those chickens will return to
your barnyard, not your neighbor's.

2093
02:26:59,331 --> 02:27:02,664
lt's an example of the devil's
chickens coming home to roost.

2094
02:27:02,868 --> 02:27:05,894
The violence that he's
perpetrated here and abroad...

2095
02:27:06,104 --> 02:27:10,040
...four children in Birmingham,
or Medgar Evers, or in Africa...

2096
02:27:10,242 --> 02:27:12,733
...this same violence has claimed
one of their own.

2097
02:27:12,944 --> 02:27:16,846
Being a farm boy, chickens coming home
to roost never made me sad.

2098
02:27:17,048 --> 02:27:19,073
ln fact, it's only made me glad.

2099
02:27:28,326 --> 02:27:29,623
Did you...

2100
02:27:30,629 --> 02:27:33,120
...read the paper today?

2101
02:27:35,901 --> 02:27:37,562
Yes, sir. l did.

2102
02:27:40,839 --> 02:27:45,776
That was a bad statement you made.

2103
02:27:47,913 --> 02:27:51,542
You knew from my instructions...

2104
02:27:51,816 --> 02:27:56,753
...no minister was to make
any statements against this man.

2105
02:27:56,955 --> 02:27:59,480
The country loved this man.

2106
02:27:59,824 --> 02:28:01,655
You have made it...

2107
02:28:02,093 --> 02:28:03,253
...hard...

2108
02:28:04,095 --> 02:28:05,756
...for Muslims...

2109
02:28:06,131 --> 02:28:07,996
...in general.

2110
02:28:10,535 --> 02:28:11,627
Yes, sir.

2111
02:28:11,836 --> 02:28:16,637
We must disassociate ourselves...

2112
02:28:16,841 --> 02:28:19,139
...from your terrible blunder.

2113
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:23,671
l must silence you.

2114
02:28:24,282 --> 02:28:26,182
For 90 days...

2115
02:28:29,354 --> 02:28:33,450
...you must not make any statements
to the press...

2116
02:28:34,192 --> 02:28:38,526
...nor are you to speak
at any temples.

2117
02:28:39,864 --> 02:28:41,024
Yes, sir.

2118
02:28:42,634 --> 02:28:45,535
Yes, sir.
l submit 1 00 percent.

2119
02:29:43,995 --> 02:29:45,087
Leave us alone.

2120
02:29:46,164 --> 02:29:48,394
Leave us alone.
Stop calling here.

2121
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:52,036
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

2122
02:29:52,337 --> 02:29:53,770
Stop it!

2123
02:30:06,551 --> 02:30:07,882
lt's all right.

2124
02:30:08,386 --> 02:30:10,047
They keep calling!

2125
02:30:11,222 --> 02:30:13,053
They keep calling!

2126
02:30:15,627 --> 02:30:16,924
Just...

2127
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:20,689
...take the babies and put them to bed.

2128
02:30:21,399 --> 02:30:23,731
Come on, babies.
Let's go to bed now.

2129
02:30:24,235 --> 02:30:25,896
-Bedtime.
-Come on.

2130
02:30:26,471 --> 02:30:27,460
Let's go.

2131
02:30:29,207 --> 02:30:32,802
-Good night, Mommy.
-Good night, Daddy.

2132
02:30:48,059 --> 02:30:50,755
Brother Minister,
l have to level with you.

2133
02:30:51,596 --> 02:30:53,587
They gave me a mission...

2134
02:30:53,998 --> 02:30:55,397
...but l couldn't do it.

2135
02:30:56,468 --> 02:30:59,028
-l love you all.
-What kind of mission?

2136
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:03,808
To wire your car...

2137
02:31:04,008 --> 02:31:06,340
...so it would explode...

2138
02:31:06,778 --> 02:31:09,042
...when you turned the ignition.

2139
02:31:10,348 --> 02:31:14,341
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

2140
02:31:14,786 --> 02:31:17,653
They say that
you're the greatest hypocrite...

2141
02:31:17,856 --> 02:31:19,346
...a Judas...

2142
02:31:19,758 --> 02:31:21,692
...a Benedict Arnold.

2143
02:31:23,094 --> 02:31:26,689
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out...

2144
02:31:27,198 --> 02:31:30,429
...and delivered
to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

2145
02:31:31,169 --> 02:31:32,898
And what do you say?

2146
02:31:33,104 --> 02:31:34,833
l'm with you, Brother Minister.

2147
02:31:35,039 --> 02:31:36,506
You'll be marked for death.

2148
02:31:37,142 --> 02:31:38,302
Yes, sir.

2149
02:31:39,377 --> 02:31:40,401
Let me die then.

2150
02:31:53,892 --> 02:31:56,087
l can't come between you
and your father.

2151
02:31:56,561 --> 02:31:58,825
-You're my father.
-Go on home.

2152
02:32:00,899 --> 02:32:03,060
Don't come back.
That's an order.

2153
02:32:10,675 --> 02:32:12,267
Yes, sir.

2154
02:32:24,656 --> 02:32:28,592
Because 1 964 threatens to be an
explosive year on the racial front...

2155
02:32:28,793 --> 02:32:33,423
...l have called this press conference
to clarify my position.

2156
02:32:33,731 --> 02:32:37,667
lnternal differences have forced me
out of the Nation of lslam.

2157
02:32:37,869 --> 02:32:41,896
ln the past, l thought and spoke
the words of Elijah Muhammad.

2158
02:32:42,106 --> 02:32:44,006
Everything l said,
l started with:

2159
02:32:44,209 --> 02:32:47,508
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us" thus-and-so.

2160
02:32:47,779 --> 02:32:49,406
That day is over.

2161
02:32:49,614 --> 02:32:53,311
From now on l speak my own words,
and l think my own thoughts.

2162
02:32:53,518 --> 02:32:56,248
Now that I have
more independence of action...

2163
02:32:56,454 --> 02:32:59,855
...I'll use a more flexible approach
in working with others...

2164
02:33:00,058 --> 02:33:01,685
...to solve this problem.

2165
02:33:01,893 --> 02:33:04,191
l'm not out to fight
other Negro leaders.

2166
02:33:04,395 --> 02:33:07,853
l"ve forgotten every bad thing
other leaders said about me...

2167
02:33:08,066 --> 02:33:11,866
...and l pray they'll forget the many
bad things l said about them.

2168
02:33:12,070 --> 02:33:16,131
We must work together to find a common
solution to a common problem.

2169
02:33:16,674 --> 02:33:19,575
I will organize
and lead a new mosque in New York:

2170
02:33:19,777 --> 02:33:21,472
Muslim Mosque, Incorporated.

2171
02:33:21,913 --> 02:33:25,405
This gives us the religious base
and the spiritual force...

2172
02:33:25,617 --> 02:33:28,245
...necessary to rid our people
of the vices...

2173
02:33:28,486 --> 02:33:30,818
...that destroy
our community's moral fiber.

2174
02:33:31,022 --> 02:33:33,388
Our politics
will be Black Nationalism...

2175
02:33:33,591 --> 02:33:36,651
...meaning, we want to control
our community's politics.

2176
02:33:36,861 --> 02:33:39,295
The Muslim Mosque, lnc.
will remain open...

2177
02:33:39,497 --> 02:33:42,762
...for ideas and financial aid
from all quarters.

2178
02:33:43,334 --> 02:33:46,269
Whites can help us,
but they can't join us.

2179
02:33:46,504 --> 02:33:49,962
There can't be black-white unity
until there's first black unity.

2180
02:33:50,241 --> 02:33:51,868
We can't unite with others...

2181
02:33:52,076 --> 02:33:54,977
...until we've first learned
to unite amongst ourselves.

2182
02:33:55,179 --> 02:33:57,306
We can't be acceptable to others...

2183
02:33:57,515 --> 02:34:00,245
...until we have first
proven acceptable to ourselves.

2184
02:34:00,451 --> 02:34:03,943
In my desire to fully understand
the religion of Islam...

2185
02:34:04,155 --> 02:34:08,251
...as practiced by 750 million
Muslims around the world...

2186
02:34:08,459 --> 02:34:12,862
...I intend to make a pilgrimage,
or holyjourney, to Mecca.

2187
02:34:13,064 --> 02:34:15,828
This pilgrimage is
a religious requirement...

2188
02:34:16,034 --> 02:34:18,594
...or duty,
of every Muslim that is able...

2189
02:34:18,803 --> 02:34:22,569
...to make the pilgrimage
at least once in his lifetime.

2190
02:34:36,521 --> 02:34:38,113
l'm Egyptian. And you?

2191
02:34:38,423 --> 02:34:39,515
American.

2192
02:34:39,724 --> 02:34:40,782
What's your name?

2193
02:34:40,992 --> 02:34:43,290
Malcolm.

2194
02:34:57,609 --> 02:34:59,736
-How much?
-Twenty Egyptian pounds.

2195
02:35:00,511 --> 02:35:01,739
For one?

2196
02:35:01,946 --> 02:35:04,312
-Special price for you.
-Special for me!

2197
02:35:04,515 --> 02:35:07,916
Okay, thank you.
Where can l get a better price?

2198
02:35:13,391 --> 02:35:15,291
-What's your name?
-Mohammed.

2199
02:35:15,493 --> 02:35:17,051
Mohammed, l'm Malcolm.

2200
02:35:18,196 --> 02:35:20,687
-Malcolm X. And you?
-Gamaal.

2201
02:35:20,932 --> 02:35:24,891
All right, Gamaal. l'm from Harlem.
From the United States.

2202
02:35:26,704 --> 02:35:29,673
-Hareem?
-No, not Hareem. Harlem.

2203
02:35:29,874 --> 02:35:31,739
Can you show me around?

2204
02:35:31,943 --> 02:35:34,434
-Hash?
-No. No hashish.

2205
02:35:36,447 --> 02:35:37,971
You know, the pyramids.

2206
02:35:38,883 --> 02:35:41,374
No, pyramids, pyramids, pyramids.

2207
02:35:47,191 --> 02:35:48,556
You're gonna take me?

2208
02:35:49,894 --> 02:35:52,089
Sphinx! Sphinx!

2209
02:37:13,544 --> 02:37:15,273
My darling Betty:

2210
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:19,773
Everywhere I go, I am welcomed
as a representative of our people.

2211
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:23,314
Our struggle is known
and respected worldwide.

2212
02:37:23,821 --> 02:37:27,587
Coincidentally, two white men
follow me around wherever I go.

2213
02:37:27,959 --> 02:37:29,893
I wonder who they're working for?

2214
02:37:30,394 --> 02:37:32,862
If I was a betting man,
I'd say the CIA.

2215
02:37:33,064 --> 02:37:34,224
What's your guess?

2216
02:37:35,233 --> 02:37:37,258
Today I arrived in Arabia.

2217
02:37:37,902 --> 02:37:41,804
I have never witnessed
such sincere hospitality...

2218
02:37:42,006 --> 02:37:44,099
...and true brotherhood...

2219
02:37:44,308 --> 02:37:45,935
...as practiced here...

2220
02:37:46,144 --> 02:37:49,409
...in the ancient
home ofAbraham, Mohammed...

2221
02:37:49,947 --> 02:37:53,144
...and the great prophets
of the Scriptures. "

2222
02:37:59,423 --> 02:38:01,983
Today, with thousands of others...

2223
02:38:02,193 --> 02:38:05,754
...I proclaimed God's greatness
in the sacred city of Mecca.

2224
02:38:06,831 --> 02:38:10,267
In the ihram garb, I made
my seven circuits around the Kaaba.

2225
02:38:10,868 --> 02:38:13,166
I drank from the well of Zem Zem.

2226
02:38:13,604 --> 02:38:16,368
I prayed to Allah from Mount Arafat.

2227
02:38:16,674 --> 02:38:20,576
It was the only time in my life that
I stood before the Creator...

2228
02:38:20,778 --> 02:38:23,269
...and felt
like a complete human being.

2229
02:38:43,467 --> 02:38:46,027
Now, you may be shocked
by these words...

2230
02:38:46,237 --> 02:38:50,105
...but I've eaten from the same plate,
drunk from the same glass...

2231
02:38:50,308 --> 02:38:54,301
...and prayed to the same God
with Muslims whose eyes were blue...

2232
02:38:54,512 --> 02:38:58,778
...whose hair was blond, and whose
skin was the whitest of white.

2233
02:38:58,983 --> 02:39:00,712
And we were all brothers...

2234
02:39:00,918 --> 02:39:01,942
...truly.

2235
02:39:02,153 --> 02:39:07,090
People of all colors and races
believing in one God, in one humanity.

2236
02:39:21,405 --> 02:39:23,635
Each hour in this sacred land
gives me...

2237
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:27,436
...greater spiritual insight into
what is happening in America.

2238
02:39:27,845 --> 02:39:32,145
The American Negro can never
be blamed for his racial animosities.

2239
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:36,309
He's only reacting to 400 years of
oppression and discrimination.

2240
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:39,978
But as racism leads America
up the suicidal path...

2241
02:39:40,191 --> 02:39:43,820
...I believe the younger generation
will see the writing on the wall...

2242
02:39:44,028 --> 02:39:47,429
...and many will want to turn to
the spiritual path of truth...

2243
02:39:47,632 --> 02:39:50,362
...the only way left to ward off
the disaster...

2244
02:39:50,568 --> 02:39:52,536
...that racism must surely lead to.

2245
02:39:53,471 --> 02:39:57,601
Once before, in prison,
the truth came and blinded me.

2246
02:39:58,709 --> 02:40:00,404
Well, it has happened again.

2247
02:40:01,445 --> 02:40:04,972
In the past, I've made sweeping
indictments of all white people.

2248
02:40:05,216 --> 02:40:07,844
And these generalizations
have caused injuries...

2249
02:40:08,052 --> 02:40:10,543
...to some whites
who didn't deserve them.

2250
02:40:11,656 --> 02:40:15,649
"Because of the spiritual rebirth
which l was blessed to undergo...

2251
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:18,021
...as a result of my pilgrimage...

2252
02:40:18,229 --> 02:40:20,322
...to the holy city of Mecca...

2253
02:40:22,099 --> 02:40:25,865
...l no longer subscribe
to sweeping indictments of one race.

2254
02:40:26,137 --> 02:40:27,570
I intend...

2255
02:40:28,506 --> 02:40:30,701
...to be very careful not to....

2256
02:40:30,908 --> 02:40:34,708
--careful not to sentence anyone
who has not been proven guilty.

2257
02:40:35,346 --> 02:40:37,371
I am not a racist...

2258
02:40:37,581 --> 02:40:40,880
...and I do not subscribe to any
of the tenets of racism.

2259
02:40:41,085 --> 02:40:42,985
In all honesty and sincerity...

2260
02:40:43,187 --> 02:40:47,283
...it can be stated that I wish
nothing but freedom, justice...

2261
02:40:47,491 --> 02:40:49,152
...and equality...

2262
02:40:49,794 --> 02:40:54,527
...life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness for all people.

2263
02:40:54,932 --> 02:40:58,163
My first concern is with the group
to which I belong...

2264
02:40:58,369 --> 02:41:02,499
...for we, more than others, are
deprived of our inalienable rights.

2265
02:41:02,707 --> 02:41:04,698
But the true practice of Islam...

2266
02:41:04,909 --> 02:41:06,900
...can remove the cancer of racism...

2267
02:41:07,111 --> 02:41:10,740
...from the hearts and the souls
of all Americans.

2268
02:41:10,948 --> 02:41:13,246
If I can die
having brought any light...

2269
02:41:13,451 --> 02:41:18,388
...having exposed any truth that
will help destroy this disease...

2270
02:41:19,123 --> 02:41:23,059
...then all the credit is due to Allah,
the Lord of all the worlds.

2271
02:41:23,527 --> 02:41:25,961
And only the mistakes have been mine.

2272
02:41:27,565 --> 02:41:29,897
Please give all my love
to the children.

2273
02:41:30,401 --> 02:41:31,959
I love you dearly.

2274
02:41:32,903 --> 02:41:36,134
Sincerely,
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz...

2275
02:41:36,474 --> 02:41:38,135
...Malcolm X.

2276
02:42:25,890 --> 02:42:27,016
Let's begin.

2277
02:42:27,224 --> 02:42:31,593
You said on your trip you sensed
a feeling of great brotherhood.

2278
02:42:31,796 --> 02:42:36,028
Yes, when I was in Mecca
making the pilgrimage...

2279
02:42:36,934 --> 02:42:41,166
...the brotherhood that existed there
among all people, all races...

2280
02:42:41,372 --> 02:42:45,399
...all levels ofpeople who
had accepted the religion of Islam...

2281
02:42:46,377 --> 02:42:50,973
...what it had done
for those people, despite...

2282
02:42:51,182 --> 02:42:53,150
...their complexion differences....

2283
02:42:53,350 --> 02:42:56,581
Perhaps ifpeople
here in America would try...

2284
02:42:56,787 --> 02:43:00,382
...and practice and study the religion
of lslam, it might help...

2285
02:43:00,591 --> 02:43:04,425
...to erase the plague of racism here.

2286
02:43:04,895 --> 02:43:08,126
l think Muslims over there
look at themselves as...

2287
02:43:08,332 --> 02:43:13,269
...human beings, as part of
the same human family.

2288
02:43:13,737 --> 02:43:16,137
Today my friends are black...

2289
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:18,840
...red, yellow, brown and white.

2290
02:43:19,043 --> 02:43:23,946
Are you prepared to ask the UN
to bring charges against the U.S...

2291
02:43:24,148 --> 02:43:25,775
...for its treatment of Negroes?

2292
02:43:25,983 --> 02:43:27,883
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

2293
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:32,311
The audience will have to be quiet.

2294
02:43:33,124 --> 02:43:34,819
Please, please.

2295
02:43:35,759 --> 02:43:38,421
Yes, as I stated earlier...

2296
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:42,524
...those nations,
African, Latin, Asian nations...

2297
02:43:42,733 --> 02:43:45,725
...are hypocritical
when they stand up in the UN...

2298
02:43:45,936 --> 02:43:49,337
...and denounce the racism practiced
in South Africa, but...

2299
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:52,168
...say absolutely nothing about...

2300
02:43:52,443 --> 02:43:55,571
...the practice of racism here
in American society.

2301
02:43:55,779 --> 02:43:58,441
Now, l wouldn't be a man
if l didn't do so.

2302
02:43:58,649 --> 02:44:03,586
Will you work now with leaders
of other civil rights organizations?

2303
02:44:03,787 --> 02:44:07,848
Yes, we're prepared to work with
any groups, leaders, organizations...

2304
02:44:08,058 --> 02:44:11,619
...as long as they're
genuinely interested in results.

2305
02:44:11,829 --> 02:44:12,761
Positive results.

2306
02:44:12,963 --> 02:44:15,693
Does your new beard have any
religious significance?

2307
02:44:16,967 --> 02:44:19,060
No, not particularly, but...

2308
02:44:19,403 --> 02:44:22,895
...l think that as black people
in America strive...

2309
02:44:23,107 --> 02:44:26,668
...to throw off the shackles
of mental colonialism...

2310
02:44:26,877 --> 02:44:28,902
...they'll also reflect
their desire...

2311
02:44:29,113 --> 02:44:32,105
...to throw off the shackles of
cultural colonialism.

2312
02:44:32,316 --> 02:44:36,116
l believe that a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

2313
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:38,345
...not necessarily a physical one...

2314
02:44:38,556 --> 02:44:42,151
...but a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa...

2315
02:44:42,359 --> 02:44:46,489
...which means we reaffirm our bond
with our brothers over there...

2316
02:44:46,797 --> 02:44:50,961
...would help to strengthen
black people in America.

2317
02:44:51,168 --> 02:44:54,467
Not only spiritually,
but it would give us the incentive...

2318
02:44:54,672 --> 02:44:57,869
...to solve some of our problems
here at home.

2319
02:44:58,075 --> 02:45:00,669
One of your
more controversial remarks...

2320
02:45:00,878 --> 02:45:04,006
...called for black people to get
rifles and form clubs.

2321
02:45:04,215 --> 02:45:05,910
Do you still favor that idea?

2322
02:45:06,083 --> 02:45:08,108
Why is that controversial?

2323
02:45:08,319 --> 02:45:11,220
lf white people find themselves
the victims of...

2324
02:45:11,422 --> 02:45:15,950
...the violence black people found
themselves victims of in America...

2325
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:19,891
...and if the government was unable
or unwilling to do anything...

2326
02:45:20,097 --> 02:45:23,225
...it'd be intelligence on their part
to defend themselves.

2327
02:45:23,434 --> 02:45:24,958
What about the guns?

2328
02:45:26,837 --> 02:45:30,637
When you tell your people to stop
being violent against my people...

2329
02:45:30,841 --> 02:45:32,900
...l'll tell them
to put away their guns.

2330
02:45:33,110 --> 02:45:34,634
So you're still an extremist.

2331
02:45:34,945 --> 02:45:36,810
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2332
02:45:43,821 --> 02:45:44,651
Next question.

2333
02:46:04,908 --> 02:46:08,605
Malcolm, you one dead, red nigger.

2334
02:46:09,179 --> 02:46:13,115
Your days on this earth are
numbered, brother.

2335
02:46:25,496 --> 02:46:26,622
Come to bed.

2336
02:46:27,231 --> 02:46:28,994
Get some rest.

2337
02:46:34,505 --> 02:46:35,995
l'm sorry, Betty.

2338
02:46:37,574 --> 02:46:38,632
Sorry for what?

2339
02:46:38,842 --> 02:46:42,505
l haven't been the best husband
or the best father.

2340
02:46:42,713 --> 02:46:45,307
A family shouldn't be separated
like ours has been.

2341
02:46:45,516 --> 02:46:49,179
l promise l'll never make a long trip
without you and the children.

2342
02:46:52,856 --> 02:46:54,414
l miss you and the girls.

2343
02:47:00,531 --> 02:47:02,522
We will be together,
l promise you that.

2344
02:47:03,867 --> 02:47:04,925
Dear heart....

2345
02:47:07,271 --> 02:47:08,761
l love you.

2346
02:47:13,477 --> 02:47:15,069
Thank you.

2347
02:47:22,586 --> 02:47:24,383
Now get some sleep.

2348
02:47:29,293 --> 02:47:32,558
We had the best organization
the black man has ever seen.

2349
02:47:33,964 --> 02:47:35,261
Niggers ruined it.

2350
02:48:06,497 --> 02:48:07,794
Wake up!

2351
02:48:11,935 --> 02:48:13,334
Come on! Let's get up!

2352
02:48:13,537 --> 02:48:15,903
Girls, come on! Come on!
Out! Out!

2353
02:48:16,273 --> 02:48:17,763
Outside! Out!

2354
02:48:19,910 --> 02:48:22,310
Go, go! Run, run!

2355
02:48:22,513 --> 02:48:24,743
Go across the street!

2356
02:48:24,948 --> 02:48:27,883
-Somebody call the fire department!
-Help! Help!

2357
02:48:29,253 --> 02:48:31,278
Call the fire department, please!

2358
02:48:31,488 --> 02:48:33,513
Somebody call the fire department!

2359
02:48:33,724 --> 02:48:34,986
l'm a man!

2360
02:48:35,192 --> 02:48:36,420
Evidently...

2361
02:48:37,861 --> 02:48:41,763
...some type of bomb was thrown against
the back of the house.

2362
02:48:41,965 --> 02:48:44,991
One was thrown on the side
of the house, from what l see.

2363
02:48:48,138 --> 02:48:51,107
lt bounced up against the window
and woke my daughter.

2364
02:48:51,308 --> 02:48:54,277
Had it gone inside,
my 2-year-old, my 4-year-old...

2365
02:48:54,478 --> 02:48:56,207
...and my 6-year-old daughter....

2366
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:59,280
Had that happened,
l'd have taken my rifle...

2367
02:48:59,483 --> 02:49:01,110
...and gone after anyone in sight.

2368
02:49:01,318 --> 02:49:04,116
Was this a warning
or an attempt on your life?

2369
02:49:04,321 --> 02:49:06,721
What, does it look like
a warning to you?

2370
02:49:06,924 --> 02:49:08,653
This was a definite attempt...

2371
02:49:08,992 --> 02:49:12,621
...by the Nation of lslam, upon
the strict orders of Elijah Muhammad.

2372
02:49:12,830 --> 02:49:15,924
-Muslim headquarters say--
-l don't care what they say.

2373
02:49:16,133 --> 02:49:17,498
l see what they're doing.

2374
02:49:17,701 --> 02:49:21,364
Minister Baines, can you tell us
who bombed the house?

2375
02:49:21,638 --> 02:49:25,506
We feel it's a publicity stunt
on the part of Malcolm X.

2376
02:49:25,742 --> 02:49:27,334
We hope it's not so that...

2377
02:49:27,544 --> 02:49:30,638
...if he can't keep the house,
we won't get it either.

2378
02:49:30,848 --> 02:49:32,338
That's enough. Excuse me.

2379
02:49:38,922 --> 02:49:40,150
l'm all right. l'm all right.

2380
02:49:40,357 --> 02:49:42,154
-Betty and the kids?
-They're fine.

2381
02:49:42,359 --> 02:49:44,554
Let's post some
men in front of the house.

2382
02:49:44,761 --> 02:49:47,662
-Did you see anybody?
-No, but l know who it is.

2383
02:49:47,865 --> 02:49:50,231
-You know l know who did it.
-Give us the command.

2384
02:49:50,434 --> 02:49:54,200
Don't worry about the command.
Two men on post, two in front!

2385
02:50:28,605 --> 02:50:29,697
Spark it.

2386
02:50:39,816 --> 02:50:41,807
As-Salaam-Alaikum, my brothers.

2387
02:50:44,588 --> 02:50:47,318
-Here's your key. Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

2388
02:50:51,094 --> 02:50:52,755
O.A.A.U.

2389
02:50:54,131 --> 02:50:56,190
Brother Earl, it's Malcolm.

2390
02:50:59,503 --> 02:51:03,064
Where are you? We've been calling
all over the city.

2391
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:04,671
Hold the phone.

2392
02:51:13,216 --> 02:51:15,116
I'm downtown.

2393
02:51:15,452 --> 02:51:18,751
I'm in a hotel trying
to get some work done for tomorrow.

2394
02:51:18,956 --> 02:51:21,789
-Let me bring some brothers there.
-That's all right.

2395
02:51:22,092 --> 02:51:24,185
I wish you'd listen to us.

2396
02:51:24,394 --> 02:51:27,591
We must frisk people
at the Audubon Ballroom meeting.

2397
02:51:27,798 --> 02:51:30,323
No, no! l don't want....

2398
02:51:30,634 --> 02:51:32,625
l don't want anybody frisked.

2399
02:51:34,805 --> 02:51:36,830
We have to change our way of thinking.

2400
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:39,167
We have to make people
feel comfortable.

2401
02:51:39,376 --> 02:51:42,937
If I can't be safe around my own kind,
who can I be safe around?

2402
02:51:43,146 --> 02:51:44,977
I trust Allah will protect me.

2403
02:51:45,182 --> 02:51:49,414
Believing in Allah is one thing,
but l also believe in being armed.

2404
02:51:52,656 --> 02:51:56,319
We don't want black people
killing each other, all right?

2405
02:51:58,762 --> 02:51:59,786
All right?

2406
02:51:59,997 --> 02:52:01,726
We'll protect you, Malcolm.

2407
02:52:02,499 --> 02:52:03,727
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

2408
02:52:03,934 --> 02:52:06,562
No, peace be unto you, Earl.

2409
02:52:44,274 --> 02:52:46,606
Do you have a Malcolm X registered?

2410
02:53:44,201 --> 02:53:47,637
Your red nigger is dead
and so are your bastard children!

2411
02:54:12,929 --> 02:54:14,453
Wake up, brother.

2412
02:54:15,031 --> 02:54:16,896
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

2413
02:54:25,142 --> 02:54:28,634
You hear me and hear me well.
You come anywhere near my family...

2414
02:54:28,879 --> 02:54:30,813
-...and l will kill you.
-Betty?

2415
02:54:31,014 --> 02:54:32,311
Do you hear?

2416
02:54:33,483 --> 02:54:35,007
Betty, it's me, Malcolm.

2417
02:54:41,758 --> 02:54:43,453
They keep calling.

2418
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:46,959
They keep threatening. l go crazy
every time a phone rings.

2419
02:54:47,164 --> 02:54:50,361
Just don't answer the phone.
Everything'll be all right.

2420
02:54:50,567 --> 02:54:53,058
-When will it stop?
-Don't answer the phone.

2421
02:54:54,237 --> 02:54:56,330
Are the brothers there on post?

2422
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:58,637
They're outside.

2423
02:54:58,842 --> 02:55:01,640
Let them answer the phone.
Don't touch the phone.

2424
02:55:01,845 --> 02:55:03,039
Beloved, where are you?

2425
02:55:03,246 --> 02:55:04,941
l'm in a hotel.

2426
02:55:06,349 --> 02:55:07,179
ln a hotel.

2427
02:55:07,584 --> 02:55:09,017
The girls asleep?

2428
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:13,514
l just put them down to bed.

2429
02:55:14,424 --> 02:55:16,585
Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?

2430
02:55:18,895 --> 02:55:20,522
No, l don't think so.

2431
02:55:21,531 --> 02:55:24,364
The girls and I want to see you.
We miss you.

2432
02:55:25,268 --> 02:55:27,259
Betty, it's too dangerous.

2433
02:55:28,038 --> 02:55:30,165
It's been dangerous.

2434
02:55:33,343 --> 02:55:36,403
Listen, l haven't told
this to anybody...

2435
02:55:39,115 --> 02:55:40,912
...but l've been thinking...

2436
02:55:41,117 --> 02:55:44,450
...about what's been happening to me
lately, to us lately...

2437
02:55:45,288 --> 02:55:48,689
...and l'm gonna stop saying
The Nation of lslam's behind this.

2438
02:55:48,892 --> 02:55:52,293
l know what they can and can't do.
l trained them.

2439
02:55:54,130 --> 02:55:57,224
Some of the things that have
been happening lately....

2440
02:55:59,302 --> 02:56:02,533
l'm gonna stop staying it's just
The Nation of lslam.

2441
02:56:02,739 --> 02:56:04,798
They're not working alone.

2442
02:56:05,408 --> 02:56:07,273
They're getting a lot of help.

2443
02:56:07,477 --> 02:56:09,240
Are you sure?

2444
02:56:10,146 --> 02:56:11,579
I miss you, Betty.

2445
02:56:15,218 --> 02:56:17,618
You're with us
even when you're away.

2446
02:56:17,821 --> 02:56:21,154
Now listen, you come on down to
the Audubon tomorrow.

2447
02:56:22,259 --> 02:56:25,888
We'll be all right.
We're not gonna let this get us down.

2448
02:56:26,096 --> 02:56:28,223
You come on down.
Bring the girls too.

2449
02:56:28,431 --> 02:56:30,922
The girls and I miss you so much.

2450
02:56:31,268 --> 02:56:32,394
I'll see you tomorrow.

2451
02:56:32,602 --> 02:56:34,695
Compared to lKing, this guy's a monk.

2452
02:56:34,905 --> 02:56:36,930
Good night.
Sleep well. I love you.

2453
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:37,970
Good night.

2454
02:56:50,987 --> 02:56:53,649
Sweetheart, Attallah, sit back.

2455
02:56:53,857 --> 02:56:57,054
Sit up.
Sit up straight.

2456
02:57:22,385 --> 02:57:24,979
Mama, l want the doll!

2457
02:58:11,534 --> 02:58:12,501
Sister?

2458
02:58:16,272 --> 02:58:19,207
-What do you say to the nice man?
-Thank you.

2459
02:58:19,409 --> 02:58:21,536
You're very welcome,
my beautiful sister.

2460
02:58:22,679 --> 02:58:23,737
Bye-bye.

2461
02:58:40,130 --> 02:58:42,428
The minister hasn't arrived yet.

2462
02:58:42,732 --> 02:58:45,257
Don't worry.
He'll be here like clockwork.

2463
02:59:18,368 --> 02:59:19,460
Son?

2464
02:59:19,669 --> 02:59:20,761
Son?

2465
02:59:21,938 --> 02:59:23,405
Are you all right?

2466
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:24,664
Are you okay?

2467
02:59:28,044 --> 02:59:30,410
Good.
l recognize you.

2468
02:59:30,613 --> 02:59:33,138
Don't you pay them folks
no never mind.

2469
02:59:33,349 --> 02:59:35,977
You just keep right on doing
what you doing.

2470
02:59:38,054 --> 02:59:39,180
Yes, ma'am.

2471
02:59:39,856 --> 02:59:42,120
-l'll pray for you, son.
-Well, thank you.

2472
02:59:42,525 --> 02:59:44,390
Jesus will protect you.

2473
02:59:58,842 --> 03:00:00,605
ls the charter ready?

2474
03:00:00,810 --> 03:00:02,607
No, Brother Minister.

2475
03:00:04,214 --> 03:00:05,647
No? Why not?

2476
03:00:08,051 --> 03:00:09,951
You had enough time, didn't you?

2477
03:00:10,153 --> 03:00:12,451
l apologize.
We'll have it next week.

2478
03:00:12,655 --> 03:00:14,953
We don't have next week.
We need it today.

2479
03:00:15,158 --> 03:00:17,524
The people want to hear
the charter today.

2480
03:00:17,727 --> 03:00:19,388
Next week, Minister.

2481
03:00:25,869 --> 03:00:27,234
ls the reverend here?

2482
03:00:27,570 --> 03:00:30,869
The reverend called and said
he wouldn't be able to attend.

2483
03:00:32,342 --> 03:00:35,834
So now we don't have
an opening speaker or a charter....

2484
03:00:36,646 --> 03:00:39,479
Why didn't you say this last night
when l talked to you?

2485
03:00:39,682 --> 03:00:42,549
-l called Sister Betty.
-You didn't have to call her!

2486
03:00:42,752 --> 03:00:44,720
You should've told me!
Why tell her?

2487
03:00:44,921 --> 03:00:47,185
-l assumed that--
-Don't assume anything!

2488
03:00:57,734 --> 03:00:58,894
Go on down front.

2489
03:00:59,202 --> 03:01:01,762
-Sister, you go on with the brother.
-Yes, sir.

2490
03:01:20,423 --> 03:01:21,617
What's wrong?

2491
03:01:26,129 --> 03:01:28,461
lt's a time for martyrs now.

2492
03:01:32,168 --> 03:01:34,033
The way l feel...

2493
03:01:35,471 --> 03:01:37,530
...l shouldn't go out there today.

2494
03:01:39,142 --> 03:01:41,633
Fine. Let's cancel it.

2495
03:01:44,647 --> 03:01:46,808
My wife out there?
My children?

2496
03:01:47,217 --> 03:01:49,208
Down front, as always.

2497
03:01:52,222 --> 03:01:54,884
Go out to the pay phone outside.

2498
03:01:56,392 --> 03:02:00,692
Call up the reverend,
see if he can make it down here.

2499
03:02:00,897 --> 03:02:02,694
l gotta be on post.

2500
03:02:02,899 --> 03:02:05,060
l'm supposed to be
guarding you.

2501
03:02:05,268 --> 03:02:10,205
-Besides, that's a duty for secretaries--
-Go out to the pay phone.

2502
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:12,332
Call up the reverend.

2503
03:02:12,842 --> 03:02:14,673
See if he can make it down here.

2504
03:02:19,148 --> 03:02:20,342
Fine.

2505
03:03:15,705 --> 03:03:16,967
Thank you.

2506
03:03:21,778 --> 03:03:24,611
l apologize for
raising my voice earlier.

2507
03:03:24,814 --> 03:03:26,406
lt was very disrespectful.

2508
03:03:26,649 --> 03:03:29,140
Brother Minister, l understand.

2509
03:03:38,094 --> 03:03:39,391
Why styles are changing...

2510
03:03:39,729 --> 03:03:42,527
...minds are changing,
why everything is changing.

2511
03:03:43,199 --> 03:03:47,260
So you and l must consider that
we're living in very changing times.

2512
03:03:47,670 --> 03:03:51,128
And what might be true today
may not be true tomorrow.

2513
03:03:52,041 --> 03:03:54,703
And without any further ado,
l present to you...

2514
03:03:55,178 --> 03:03:57,874
...Brother Minister Malcolm.
And l pray...

2515
03:03:58,348 --> 03:04:02,045
...that you and l will listen.
Listen...

2516
03:04:02,685 --> 03:04:05,176
...hear and understand.

2517
03:04:05,388 --> 03:04:06,218
Thank you.

2518
03:04:13,229 --> 03:04:14,594
Daddy!

2519
03:04:28,878 --> 03:04:31,039
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2520
03:04:32,815 --> 03:04:33,907
Brother....

2521
03:04:34,117 --> 03:04:35,209
Please. Hold it.

2522
03:04:36,886 --> 03:04:38,877
Calm down.
Please, brothers!

2523
03:04:39,088 --> 03:04:40,020
Brothers....

2524
03:05:21,764 --> 03:05:23,857
Get an ambulance!

2525
03:05:24,066 --> 03:05:25,090
Get an ambulance!

2526
03:05:25,368 --> 03:05:26,494
They killed him!

2527
03:05:28,271 --> 03:05:30,262
They killed him!

2528
03:06:49,285 --> 03:06:50,718
Get out of the way!

2529
03:06:55,992 --> 03:06:56,822
Move!

2530
03:07:05,201 --> 03:07:06,566
Stand back!

2531
03:07:07,103 --> 03:07:08,092
Get back!

2532
03:07:10,039 --> 03:07:12,507
Give us a statement, sir!
Please!

2533
03:07:12,708 --> 03:07:16,144
The person you know
as Malcolm X is no more.

2534
03:07:16,479 --> 03:07:18,470
The assassination...

2535
03:07:18,714 --> 03:07:22,309
...of Malcolm X
was an unfortunate tragedy.

2536
03:07:22,718 --> 03:07:25,380
And it reveals
that there are still...

2537
03:07:25,721 --> 03:07:28,815
...numerous people
in our nation who have...

2538
03:07:29,058 --> 03:07:33,722
...degenerated to the point of
expressing dissent through murder...

2539
03:07:33,996 --> 03:07:36,294
...and we haven't learned
to disagree...

2540
03:07:36,499 --> 03:07:38,558
...without being
violently disagreeable.

2541
03:07:39,835 --> 03:07:40,893
Here...

2542
03:07:41,671 --> 03:07:44,333
...at this final hour...

2543
03:07:44,907 --> 03:07:47,171
...in this quiet place...

2544
03:07:47,877 --> 03:07:50,175
...Harlem has come to bid farewell...

2545
03:07:50,379 --> 03:07:52,779
...to one of its brightest hopes...

2546
03:07:53,816 --> 03:07:55,784
...extinguished now...

2547
03:07:56,252 --> 03:07:58,914
...and gone from us forever.

2548
03:07:59,822 --> 03:08:02,848
It is not in the memory
of man that this...

2549
03:08:03,059 --> 03:08:04,617
...beleaguered, unfortunate...

2550
03:08:04,827 --> 03:08:06,954
...but nonetheless proud community...

2551
03:08:07,363 --> 03:08:11,766
...has found a braver,
more gallant young champion...

2552
03:08:12,034 --> 03:08:15,492
...than this Afro-American
who lies before us...

2553
03:08:16,439 --> 03:08:18,430
...unconquered still.

2554
03:08:20,343 --> 03:08:22,709
I say the word again as
he would want me to:

2555
03:08:22,912 --> 03:08:24,277
Afro-American.

2556
03:08:24,513 --> 03:08:27,812
Afro-American Malcolm.

2557
03:08:28,017 --> 03:08:30,747
Malcolm had stopped being "Negro"...

2558
03:08:30,953 --> 03:08:32,284
...years ago.

2559
03:08:32,521 --> 03:08:37,458
It had become too small, too puny,
too weak a word for him.

2560
03:08:37,793 --> 03:08:39,988
Malcolm was bigger than that.

2561
03:08:40,296 --> 03:08:41,593
Malcolm had become...

2562
03:08:41,831 --> 03:08:44,061
...an Afro-American.

2563
03:08:44,333 --> 03:08:46,563
And he wanted so desperately...

2564
03:08:47,103 --> 03:08:49,697
...that we,
that all his people...

2565
03:08:49,905 --> 03:08:52,999
...would become Afro-Americans too.

2566
03:08:57,013 --> 03:09:00,471
There are those who
still consider it their duty...

2567
03:09:00,683 --> 03:09:04,380
...as friends of the Negro people,
to tell us...

2568
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:06,649
...to revile him.

2569
03:09:06,856 --> 03:09:10,155
To flee, even from
the presence of his memory.

2570
03:09:10,359 --> 03:09:11,883
To save ourselves...

2571
03:09:12,094 --> 03:09:16,656
...by writing him out of
the history of our turbulent times.

2572
03:09:17,033 --> 03:09:19,092
And we will smile.

2573
03:09:19,402 --> 03:09:21,734
They will say that
he is of hate, a fanatic...

2574
03:09:21,937 --> 03:09:24,929
...a racist, who can only bring
evil to the cause...

2575
03:09:25,141 --> 03:09:26,574
...for which you struggle.

2576
03:09:26,776 --> 03:09:29,745
And we will answer and
say unto them:

2577
03:09:29,945 --> 03:09:31,913
"Did you ever talk...

2578
03:09:32,281 --> 03:09:33,942
...to Brother Malcolm?

2579
03:09:34,583 --> 03:09:36,414
Did you ever touch him...

2580
03:09:36,619 --> 03:09:38,746
...or have him smile at you?

2581
03:09:38,954 --> 03:09:41,286
Did you ever really listen to him?"

2582
03:09:43,526 --> 03:09:47,758
"Was he ever associated with violence
or any public disturbance?

2583
03:09:47,963 --> 03:09:50,864
For if you did, you would know him.

2584
03:09:51,067 --> 03:09:52,557
And if you knew him...

2585
03:09:52,802 --> 03:09:56,533
...you would know why
we must honor him. "

2586
03:09:56,739 --> 03:10:01,073
Malcolm was our manhood.
Our living, black manhood.

2587
03:10:01,310 --> 03:10:03,369
This was his meaning
to his people.

2588
03:10:03,646 --> 03:10:08,242
And in honoring him, we honor
the best in ourselves.

2589
03:10:09,618 --> 03:10:12,280
However much we may have
differed with him...

2590
03:10:12,488 --> 03:10:15,548
...or with each other about him
and his value as a man...

2591
03:10:15,758 --> 03:10:17,885
...let his going from us serve...

2592
03:10:18,094 --> 03:10:21,154
...only to bring us together now...

2593
03:10:22,164 --> 03:10:24,826
...consigning these mortal
remains to earth...

2594
03:10:25,334 --> 03:10:27,393
...the common mother of all...

2595
03:10:27,603 --> 03:10:30,936
...secure in the knowledge
that what we place in the ground...

2596
03:10:31,140 --> 03:10:32,471
...is no more now a man...

2597
03:10:32,742 --> 03:10:34,266
...but a seed...

2598
03:10:34,610 --> 03:10:37,579
...which after the winter of
our discontent...

2599
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:40,647
...will come forth again
to meet us.

2600
03:10:40,850 --> 03:10:43,080
And we shall know him then...

2601
03:10:43,285 --> 03:10:46,152
...for what he was and is:

2602
03:10:46,355 --> 03:10:48,152
A prince.

2603
03:10:48,357 --> 03:10:51,952
Our own black shining prince...

2604
03:10:52,695 --> 03:10:55,858
...who didn't hesitate to die...

2605
03:10:56,198 --> 03:10:57,529
...because...

2606
03:10:58,200 --> 03:10:59,827
...he loved us so.

2607
03:11:00,569 --> 03:11:01,763
And so today...

2608
03:11:01,971 --> 03:11:05,134
...May 1 9, we celebrate
Malcolm X's birthday...

2609
03:11:05,374 --> 03:11:09,208
...because he was
a great, great Afro-American.

2610
03:11:09,478 --> 03:11:12,140
Malcolm X is you, all of you.

2611
03:11:12,548 --> 03:11:14,607
And you are Malcolm X.

2612
03:11:15,151 --> 03:11:16,175
l'm Malcolm X!

2613
03:11:16,385 --> 03:11:17,443
l'm Malcolm X!

2614
03:11:17,720 --> 03:11:18,618
l'm Malcolm X!

2615
03:11:28,063 --> 03:11:30,554
As Brother Malcolm said:

2616
03:11:33,402 --> 03:11:35,336
"We declare...

2617
03:11:36,672 --> 03:11:38,333
...our right...

2618
03:11:40,476 --> 03:11:42,171
...on this earth...

2619
03:11:43,546 --> 03:11:45,138
...to be a man...

2620
03:11:47,383 --> 03:11:49,544
...to be a human being...

2621
03:11:51,821 --> 03:11:54,221
...to be given the rights...

2622
03:11:54,990 --> 03:11:56,719
...of a human being...

2623
03:11:58,561 --> 03:12:00,392
...to be respected...

2624
03:12:01,564 --> 03:12:03,828
...as a human being...

2625
03:12:04,733 --> 03:12:06,997
...in this society...

2626
03:12:08,237 --> 03:12:10,068
...on this earth...

2627
03:12:11,574 --> 03:12:13,405
...in this day...

2628
03:12:14,009 --> 03:12:16,637
...which we intend to bring...

2629
03:12:16,846 --> 03:12:18,177
...into existence--"

2630
03:12:18,380 --> 03:12:21,213
--by any means necessary!
