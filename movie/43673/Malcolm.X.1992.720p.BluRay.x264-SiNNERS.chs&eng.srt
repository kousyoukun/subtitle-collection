120
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,900

It's all right.

125
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,430
在他们离开之前
They broke every window with their rifle butts

126
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,470
他们用枪打烂所有窗门

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,100
就如他们来的时候 突然向着月光离去
They rode off into the moonlight on their horses as suddenly as they had come.

他相信在美国的黑种人
He believed, as did Marcus Garvey

131
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,450
就像马库斯・加维一样
that freedom, independence and self- respect

132
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,780
不会得到自由 独立和自尊

在非洲建立一个伟大的国家

135
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,880
黑种人该返回他们本来的地方
black men should leave America and return to their land of origin.

136
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,800
他们的家园 非洲
To his original home, Africa.

137
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,630
我爸致力于他的信仰
My father dedicated his life to his beliefs

138
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,590
因他曾目睹他六个兄弟中的四个被杀
because four of his six brothers died violently.

139
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,720
三个被白种人所杀 一个被判私刑
Three killed by white men, and one lynched.

140
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,220
家中一共九个孩子
There were nine children in our family.

141
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,400
我妈是个有教养 骄傲且坚强的女人
My mother was a proud woman, an educated woman, a strong woman.

142
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,530
她的白色皮肤是因为她妈妈被白种人强奸
She was fair- skinned because her mother was raped by a white man.

143
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,400
她嫁给我爸的一个 原因就是我爸皮肤很黑
One reason she married my father was because he was so black.

144
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,950
她讨厌自己身世和体内白种人的血
She hated her complexion, the white blood in her body

145
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
希望孩子是有色人种
and she wanted her children to have some color.

146
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,750
这对我和其他的黑种人影响很大
In fact, I think this had a profound effect on me back then and on most Negroes today.

147
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,830
因为很多黑种人姐妹
Because so many of our sisters

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,710
被白种人强奸
have been raped or violated by the white man

149
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,840
黑种人很渴望拥有白种人的宝贝
black men can't wait to get their hands on the white man's prize

150
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,720
一个白种女人
A white woman.

151
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,010
非洲给回非洲人!
Africa for the Africans!

152
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,020
- 说"露丝兰" - 露丝兰
- Say "Roseland" - Roseland.

153
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,230
表演时间
Showtime!

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800

You're too big!

156
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,350
- 我过来捉你 - 不好

157
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,320

You in charge, boy!

159
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,500
喜欢你所见吗?
You like what you see, baby?

160
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,720
- 不 回来! - 继续!
- No! Get back here! - Go ahead, boy!

161
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,680
- 瑞德 救我! 救我! - 抓到你了!
- Red, save me! Save me! - Gotcha!

162
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,020
咦 矮子 我想再跳一次
Come on, Shorty. I wanna dance again!

163
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,410
矮子 矮子 矮子.
Shorty, Shorty! Shorty.

164
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,820
棒极了 瑞德 矮子 矮子!

165
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,440
- 劳拉可继续跳 是吗?
Laura sure can go, can't she?

166
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,690
- 我要去洗手间 - 好的
- I gotta go freshen up. - All right.

167
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,860
- 快些回来 - 好的 马尔克姆
- You come on back now. - All right, Malcolm.

168
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,660
那女孩子如我的酒一样好
That chick is fine as May wine.

169
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,290
除了她住在山上 还有一个祖母
Except she lives up on a hill and got a grandmother too.

170
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,830
她是个教堂女 我不知该怎么办
She's a church girl. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

171
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,610
想跳舞吗?
Wanna dance?

172
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,090
他们叫你什么名字
So, what do they call you?

173
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,640
- 瑞德 - 瑞德?

174
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,640

很好 谢谢
Very well, thank you.

176
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,020
我有个提议 瑞德
I have an idea, Red.

177
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,940
为何不带那女孩子回家再回来?
Why don't you take that little girl home and come on back?

178
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,330
- 啥? - 嘿
- Wha? - Heh.

179
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,910
只是散步 别跑
Just walk, baby, don't run.

180
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,710
你回来时还没完
It'll be here when you get back.

181
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,220
那 我不进去了
Well, I better not come in.

182
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,940
- 我不是傻的 - 什么?
- I'm not stupid. - What?

183
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,190
很晚了 宝贝
It's late, baby.

184
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,360
我知道你要去哪里 我不是傻子
I know where you're going. I am not a total square.

185
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,900
- 我知道要发生什么 - 我要回家 很晚了
- I know what's happening - I gotta go home. It's late.

186
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,950
明天一早我还要上班
I gotta get up early in the morning. I gotta work tomorrow.

187
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,290
我明天打电话给你?
I'll call you tomorrow?

188
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,040
为什么?
What for?

189
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,960
我不是白种人 打电话给我干什么
I'm not white and I don't put out, so why would you want to call me?

190
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,880
晚安 约翰逊太太 明天给电话你
Good night, Mrs. Johnson. I'll call you tomorrow.

191
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,020
我是你第一个白种女人吗
Am I the first white woman you've been with?

192
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,440
不 你不是
No, you ain't. Heh.

193
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,740
我试过很多次了
Shit, I done had plenty.

194
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,400
是吗? - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

195
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,450
是不是妓女?
That isn't a whore?

196
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,590
慢慢来
Take your time.

197
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,300
索菲亚不会去哪里的
Sophia's not going anywhere.

198
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,890
记着是散步
I told you to walk

199
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,810
别跑
don't run.

200
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,060
我不喜欢话多的女人
I don't like women that talk too much. Okay?

201
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,820
好
Heh. Okay.

202
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,150
是谁想说话?
Who wants to talk?

203
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,870
在每一天的结束
"At the end of each day"

204
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,370
在一个神圣的梦想里
"In a dream that's divine"

205
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,500
我的祈祷
"My prayer"

206
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,170
是一个蓝色的狂喜
"Is a rapture in blue"

207
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,880
- 耶 瑞德 - 继续 你没打中我!
- Yeah, Red! - Come on, you missed me.

208
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,430
额 试试这个
Eh, try this on for size.

209
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,770
- 我中枪了 - 你中枪了 ?
- I ducked. - You ducked?

210
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,230
你没有 我差点才射中
You didn't! I got you right between the toes!

211
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,900
我玩厌了警察 我想做保加特
I'm tired of playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart.

212
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,980
矮子 你太矮了 做不了保加特
Shorty, you're too small to be Bogart.

213
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,860
我做卡格尼就不矮了
I'm not too short to be Cagney.

214
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,370
再来一次
One more! Boom!

215
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,080
我的天
Jesus.

216
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,290
你这肮脏的 堕落的 烂醉的警察!
You dirty, rotten, stinking copper!

217
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,130
你一向是个大人物
You used to be a big shot.

218
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,260
我也无能为力
There is just nothing I can do.

219
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,720
- 什么意思 终身监禁? - 你听到判决的
- What do you mean, took his own life? - You heard the verdict.

220
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,730
判决? 有人会打断自己的背部?
Verdict? A man takes a hammer and bashes in the back of his own head?

221
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,270
然后卧在路轨被车碾过吗?
Then he lays on the tracks and kills himself?

222
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,110
判决不是我们能控制的
We merely act on the verdicts, we don't make them.

223
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,240
你明白吗?
Do you pay or don't you?

224
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,740
请看这里 夫人
Read the policy, ma'am.

225
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,080
清楚写明

226
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,550
过来这里 索菲亚
Come here, Sophia.

227
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,190
你是主人
You're the man.

228
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,610
坐下
Sit down.

229
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,450
你怎么了?
What's your story?

230
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,080
嫌自己太白不够黑 这是你想要的吗?
You one of them white chicks can't get enough colored studs. Is that what you are?

231
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,300
吻我的脚
Kiss my foot.

232
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,630
吻吧
Go ahead, kiss it.

233
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,520
喂我
Now, feed me.

234
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,170
我知道你想这样
That's your story, girl.

235
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,800
- 你何时想被人强奸了? - 哈? 我?
- So when you gonna holler rape, sister? - Ha, me?

236
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,550
是 是的 你会 若时机到
Yes, you. You would, if the time came.

237
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,010
你当然会
Sure you would.

238
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,550
马尔克姆 让我喂你
Malcolm, let me feed you.

239
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
来
Come on.

240
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,180
趁热吃
While they're hot.

241
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,150
真希望你父母看到你这个样子
I wish your mother and father could see you now.

242
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,900
还有你要嫁的那个白种人
And that ofay you're gonna marry.

243
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,200
真希望劳拉能见到我们这样
I sure wish Laura could see us.

244
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,750
别 马尔克姆
Please, Malcolm.

245
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,710
这里没有其他人
There's nobody around.

246
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,920
这样是不对的
No, this ain't right.

247
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,590
- 为什么 - 因为你
- Why? - Because you

248
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,760
不是 是因为那个白种女人?
No, it's because of the white girl, isn't it?

249
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,970
- 不是 - 人们说你和她一起
- It's not because of that. - Folks say you run around with her.

250
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,430
不是
It's not because of that.

251
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,440
只是不可以乱来 你祖母比你想像中醒目得多
Save it for Mr. Right. Your grandmother's smarter than you think.

252
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,610
对不起她养大我成这样
I'm sorry she raised me that way.

253
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,330
你妈还在吗?
Is your mother alive?

254
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,580
她还活着
Yes, she's alive.

255
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,080
我小孩时很穷 以为"不出售"
When I was a kid, I was so poor I thought "not for sale"

256
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,460
是个品牌的名称
was a brand name.

257
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,670
- 我有敲门 - 你听见我说"进来"了吗?
- I did knock. - Did you hear me say, "Come in"?

258
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,050
没必要吵架 对不起
There's no point in fighting about it. I'm sorry.

259
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,300
- 我可坐下吗? - 你问得这样有礼
- May I sit down? - You're nice enough to ask.

260
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,270
仍是同一个问题 里特太太
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little.

261
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,060
- 自从你丈夫死了 - 是被杀 被杀
- Since your husband's death. - Murder. Murder.

262
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,730
这里有些关于你小孩的问题
there's a question as to whether or not you are capable

263
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,110
你可否独力养活这些孩子
of raising these children on your own.

264
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
这些是我的孩子
These are my children.

265
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,700
他们是我的孩子
They're mine.

266
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,370
根本没有问题
And they ain't no question.

267
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,500
有时公正是唯一的仁慈
Sometimes I think, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.

268
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,880
你所有孩子都未成年
All your children are delinquent

269
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,090
- 至少有一个 马尔克姆 还是个小偷 - 滚
- and one at least, Malcolm, is a thief. - Get out of here!

270
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,800
你对孩子不存在有管教
Your control over your children is therefore nonexistent.

271
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,470
听到我讲吗?
Did you hear me?

272
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,470
你会后悔的
You will regret this.

273
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,940
若你再不走 你才会后悔
If you don't move out through that door, you'll be past regretting!

274
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,190
我们全部会被带走
We were parceled out, all of us.

275
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,740
我相信 若政府破坏人们的家庭
I truly believe that if ever a state agency destroyed a family

276
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,450
便是破坏了我们的家庭
it destroyed ours.

277
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,700
我被送去一人家 住在这个女人家
I was sent to a detention home and lived at this woman's house.

278
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,160
我知道你会保持干净的
I know you'll keep it clean.

279
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,670
史威连太太的家
Mrs. Swerlin.

280
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
这是新来的马尔克姆
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.

281
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,090
大家要待他如兄弟
We'll treat him like a brother.

282
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,590
我是班中唯一的有色人种
I was special. The only colored kid in the class.

283
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,220
成了大家的笑柄
I became sort of a mascot, like a pink poodle.

284
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,480
人们叫我做黑鬼 我觉得没什么的
I got called a nigger so much, I didn't think it was wrong.

285
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,600
还以为是我的名字
I thought it was my name.

286
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,360
他们当我不存在那样谈论我 把我看作牛马
They talked about me like I wasn't there, like I was a pedigreed dog or a horse

287
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,400
好像我不存在
like I was invisible.

288
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,490
最重要的是要认清现实
The important thing is to be realistic.

289
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,200
我们喜欢你在这里
We all like you here, you know that.

290
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,290
但你是黑种人
But you're a nigger

291
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,790
做律师是黑种人现实不了的志愿
and a lawyer is no realistic goal for a nigger.

292
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,580
为什么 奥斯特洛夫斯基先生?
But why, Mr. Ostrowski?

293
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,250
我的成绩是班中最好的
I gets the best grades in class.

294
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,880
被选为班主席 我想做律师
I got voted class president. I want to be a lawyer.

295
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,220
我想你考虑其他选择
I want you to think about something that you can be.

296
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,970
你的手工艺很好
You're good with your hands, making things.

297
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,730
人们会给你工作
People would give you work. I would, myself.

298
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,270
为何不做个木匠?
Why don't you become a carpenter?

299
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,980
是很适合有色人种专业
That's a good profession for a colored.

300
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,820
你爸是木匠吗?
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

301
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,740
耶稣是木匠
Jesus was a carpenter.

302
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,950
人们喜欢你是人材 你做得很不错
People like you as a person. You're doing real well.

303
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,410
记着我们的说话
Remember what we said

304
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,410
"一事成功 万事顺利" 讲给我听
"Nothing succeeds like success." Let me hear it.

305
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,000
一事成功 万事顺利
Nothing succeeds like success.

306
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,130
对 只要你面对现实
Right. As long as you're realistic.

307
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,800
这不是世界末日 马尔克姆
It's not the end of the world, Malcolm.

308
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,680
我说 不好
I said, "Don't

309
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,930
别拿猪给那孩子
let them give that boy no pig."

310
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,310
对于我来说不是世界末日
It wasn't the end of the world for me.

311
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,720
但对于我妈来说末日刚开始
But it was the beginning of the end for my mother.

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,340
这些衣服哪里弄来的?
Where'd you get them goddamn vines you got on?

405
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,380
还有鞋? 噢 天哪
And them shoes? Oh, my.

406
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,050
我们可以做点事
We can do something about that.

407
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,510
但是他帮我弄的难看极了
But he's putting a hurting on my vision, man. Damn.

408
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,850
别紧张
Relax.

409
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,930
- 怎么找到你? - 你不能
- So how can I get ahold of you? - You can't.

410
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,100
我找你
I get ahold of you.

411
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,480
好了 我写下来
All right, I'll write it down.

412
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,520
永远别写下什么
Don't ever write anything down.

413
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,440
记在这里
File it up here.

414
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,190
像我一样
Like I do.

415
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,450
没有白纸黑字便没有证据
If the man don't have any paper, he will never have any proof.

416
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,030
明白吗?
Dig?

417
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,160
我明白 对
Yeah, I dig. Right.

418
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,290
看着我的脸
Look me in the face.

419
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,130
你刚才骗我?
Did you, just now, con me?

420
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,130
是
Yes, sir.

421
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,180
- 为什么 - 因为我想加入
- Why? - Because I want in.

422
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,720
要知道你在这里不太难
It don't take a lot to know you're already there.

423
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,600
至少他够坦白
At least he ain't lying.

424
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,230
我要点火
I have a run to make.

425
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,440
我帮你 阿奇先生
- Let me make that run with you, Mr. Archie.

426

我喜欢你的心灵

427
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,740
喜欢你的作风
I like your style.

00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,700
你可加入了 瑞德先生
You might just do, Mr. Red.

429
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,120
除非你仍要回火车那工作
Unless, of course, you have to get back to your train job.

430
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,460
我己经对火车上的人说了
I've told him what to do with that train.

431
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,880
- 何时 - 就刚刚
- When? - Just now.

432
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,510
好吧
All right.

433
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,430
跟我来
Come with me.

434
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,510
我带你买东西
I'm taking you shopping.

435
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,930
我叫凯迪拉克
Cadillac's the name.

436
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,350
萨米
Sammy, man.

437
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,190
- 准备好没? - 好了

438
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,530
扣好扣子
Button more buttons on the jacket.

439
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,870
- 你看上去很有型 - 谢谢
- You look good. - Yes, man.

440
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,410
但好像少了什么
But you're missing something.

441
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,910
- 搜我身 - 什么?
- Frisk me. - What?

442
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,040
来啊 搜我身
Go ahead, frisk me.

443
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,840
没什么 是吗
Nothing, right?

444
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,270
我仍带枪
I'm still carrying.

445
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,310
这是我第一枝枪
This was my first gun.

446
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,110
现在是你的了
Now it's yours.

447
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,530
多谢
Thank you.

00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,990
这样佩戴
You wear it

449
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,240
这样 对
wear it so.

450
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,160
后面不显眼
Small of the back.

451
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,670
现在你高人一等了
Now you're outfitted.

452
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,340
- 准备好面对街上的挑战吗? - 我准备好了
- You ready to tackle the streets? - Yeah, I'm ready.

453

Let them come.

454
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,050
翻开《约翰的福音》
Let us now turn to the Gospel According to St. John.

455
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,600

"And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim

459
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,480
因为那里有很多圣水
because there was much water.

460
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,820
很多人前来这里
And they came

461
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,700
接受洗礼
and were baptized."

313
313.

463
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,410
255
255.

464
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,630
应该是251
It got to be 251.

465
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,130
403
403.

466
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,210
我发梦见过
I saw it in my dream.

467
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,840
555
555.

468
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,550
- 觉得怎样 - 很好
- What you know, daddy- o? - I feel straight.

469
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,970
你今天真走运
Your lucky day.

470
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
让我继续好运吧
Roll it for me.

471
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,230
告诉过你不要写
I told you, no paper, no trouble.

472
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,140
我正努力尝试
I'm working on it.

473
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,650
我把所有号码记在脑里
I keep all my numbers in my head.

474
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,730
我从未试要写下来 记着
I've never written a number down yet. Remember that.

475
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,830
到你了
Your turn.

476
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,970
慢慢来
Easy.

477
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,480
- 你没事吧? - 有事的话早就死了
- You there? - If I ain't, I'm right next door.

478
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,650
世上没有其他事能令你这样畅快
Nothing in this world can give you that real deep cool.

479
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,520
那个女孩
The girl.

480
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,630
兴奋无比
About as mellow as I can be.

她手脚太慢了
The bitch move too slow.

491
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,590
有时他的嘴又大又丑

492

今天你等了很久? 等了很久了吗?

513
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,050
不是钱的问题 我想确信你是否没事
It ain't the money. I just wanna make sure you're okay, baby.

- What, you a private detective now? - Just asking.

521
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,000
别问我那些该死的问题
Don't ask me no goddamn questions.

522
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,420
只有我能问你
I ask you the questions.

523
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
明白吗
You understand?

- She come in here a lot? - Almost every night.

525

和他?
With him?

00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,430
- 她知道他有毒瘾吗? - 若她长了眼睛便会看到
- She know he's strung out? - If she got eyes, she do.

527
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,010

- She ain't hooking, is she? - Not yet, Red.

528
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,680
但他很快会令她是
But the way things are, he'll turn her out any day now.

529
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,190
你仍挂念她?
You stuck on her, huh?

530
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,490
这正是你的问题 别多管闲事
See, that's your problem, girl. You need to mind your own goddamn business, or I'm

531
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,280
别这样做!
Don't do that!

537
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,280

Give me a light.

539
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,840
你很紧张 有何不妥?

540
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,010
- 没有 - 真的?

541
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,970
一切都很好 我没担心
Everything's all right. I'm not worrying about it.

542
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,640

00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,970
我在想我的钱
I'm thinking about my money. Heh.

544

你欠我六百块 阿奇

你没买821
You didn't have 821.

547
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,980
你忘了 我告诉过你的
Were you high? I threw the slats at you, told you to combinate me.

548
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,200
- 我告诉你 你永远都得不到 - 索菲亚也在场
- I'm telling you, you never had it. - I tell you I did. Sophia was there.

549
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,120
阿奇 你记得的 不是吗?
Archie, you remember, don't you?

550
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,240
等下 你期望她说什么
Wait, what you expect her to say?

551
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,410
别这样
Don't do this.

552
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,660
好吗?
All right?

553

好吧 算了吧
All right, skip it.

555
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,920
你赖帐是不是? 阿奇
But you're slipping, Archie?

556
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,670
你赖帐

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,820
嘿 阿奇 听着

559
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,570
嘿 喝什么? 我请客

00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,280
- 我不会和你一起喝酒的 - 拜托 阿奇
- I ain't drinking with you. - Oh, Archie.

561
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,660
好吗?
All right?

562
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,040
塞姆 走吧
Come, Sam.

563
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,420
我会在那边的
I'll be right there, man.

564
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,180
二十二年
Twenty- two years.

565
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,010
二十二年 我知道他从没忘记过一个号码
Twenty- two years, I never knowed him to forget a number.

566
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,680
每件事总有第一次
First time for everything.

567
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,770
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

568
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,560
他首次要检讨自己看错了人
The first thing he'll do is check with the collector for an oversight.

569
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,820
他的声誉会受影响 你也是
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

570
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,950
瑞德 若你说谎 你便死定了
And, Red, if you're lying, you're a dead man.

571
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,910
死 死 死
Dead, dead, dead.

572
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,370
你去告诉他吧
You go and tell him that.

573
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,300
嘿 瑞德
My man, Red.

574
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,300
晚安
Night to you.

575
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,970
我不明白阿奇 你有那个号码
I don't understand Archie. You had the number.

576
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,180
城市的道路
"Away from the city"

577
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,520
带着伤害和嘲笑
"That hurts and mocks"

578
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,980
我独自站着
"I'm standin' alone"

579
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,820
经过荒凉的码头
"By the desolate docks"

580
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,660
"但寒意未尽
In the still and the chill"

581
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,750
在这个夜晚
"Of the night"

582
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,830
我看到地平线
"I see the horizon"

583
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,500
伟大的未解之谜
"The great unknown"

584
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,300
我没叫过你别背着空位坐吧?
Didn't I tell you never sit with your back to no door?

585
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,220
这沉重如石
"It's as heavy as stone"

586
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,510
知道嘛?
You know what?

587
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,350
你是个大话精
You're a damn liar.

588
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,930
她也是
And so is she.

589
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,190
你想搞定我
So you figure to take me

590
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,980

- 就你和我? - 对
- So it's you and me, huh? - That's right.

593
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,410
我会还那六百块给你
I'll give you back the $600.

594
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,370
- 我不要 - 你知道我有枪
- I don't want it. - I'm wearing.

595
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,700
现在有三把枪指着你 试试吧
There's three guns on you, so you take your chances, my friend.

596
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,500
我的爱人
"Will the one I love"

597
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,790

我们出去走走
Let's walk.

600
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,850
我掩盖
"I cover"

601
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,350
我就是这样收场的? 阿奇
So this is how I'm going out, huh, Archie?

602
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,060

像其他骗子一样 我被困了
Like every hustler, I was trapped.

650
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,810
爵士乐们聚集一起想

找答案 但没有发现

I'm in this situation, and I'm getting out.

818
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,430
事情变得糟糕 我要坚强
Anything go wrong, I'm strong.

819
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,440

你知道耶稣和你是 朋友 吗
You know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?

825
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,990
朋友?
Heh. A friend? Huh?

826
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,490
若他是个朋友 他在哪里?
He's a friend, huh, chappy? If he's such a friend, where is he? Huh?

827
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,910
他为我做什么了?
What's he done for me?

828
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,450
朋友
A friend! Ha.

01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:18,120
告诉你做什么 叫他来找我

我需要他的时候 他在哪里

告诉我 耶稣在哪里? 我告诉你

835
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:35,850
他和警长外出游玩了
He's out with the police captain! I'll straighten him out!

836
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,140
他为我做了什么? 他没为我做过什么

什么也没做过
Done nothing for me.

838
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,530
这是什么样的朋友 叫他来添我屁股
"What a friend we have in Jesus." Jesus can kiss my ass!

839
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,320
告诉他来添我的屁股 怎么样?
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass. How about that? Tell him that.

840

01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:58,720
A228
A- 228.

846
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,140
继续
Come on.

847
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,240
我知道你的感受
I know how you feel.

848
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:21,540
你想就此死了
Like you want to lay down and die.

849
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,330
我带了点东西给你
I brought you something.

850
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,380
我不需要你的帮忙
Yeah, I don't need no more favors from you.

851
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:31,300
是核仁 放入水里喝
It's nutmeg. Put it in the water.

852
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,220
你要喝点东西来补充你的体力
You need something to get the monkey off your back.

853
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,930
不是可卡因 但有帮助的
It's not cocaine, but it'll help some.

854
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,520
慢慢喝 很强力的
Drink it slow. The stuff is strong.

855
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,150
你有什么招数?
So, what's your hype?

856
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:59,160
我可以教你怎样离开监狱 不是招数
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.

857
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,530
说来听听
Talk, daddy- o. I'm listening.

858
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:06,670
- 不错 还有吗? - 那是最后的了
- This ain't bad. You got some more? - That's the last fix I'm giving you.

859
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,330
为什么给我喝
So why'd you give it to me?

860
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:13,710
因为你需要 不喝的话你不会听我说
Because you needed it. Because you couldn't hear me without it.

861
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,380
黑鬼 快滚
Nigger, get on out of my face.

862
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,930
你比其他犯人更聪明
I think you got more sense than any cat in this prison.

863
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,180
为何不好好利用?
Why the hell don't you use it?

864
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,440
你逃不出去 不像电影那样
You can't bust out of here like they do in the movies.

865
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,150
即使你出去了 还要坐牢
Even if you get out, you're still in prison.

866
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,650
你没忽悠我吧
You ain't lying there.

867
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,820
你还会碰壁 你不用脑筋
You'll bang against a stone wall. You're not using your brain!

868
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,950
这正是白种人所希望的
That's what the white man wants.

869
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,530
看看你 涂毒药在头发上
Look at you, putting all that poison in your hair.

870
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:47,160
我想你坐牢太久了 外面人人都是这样
I think you been in prison too long, because everybody on the outside conks.

871
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,670
他们为什么要这样?
Why does everybody on the outside conk?

872
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,000
人们不希望样子像
They don't want to walk around with a nappy head, looking like

873
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,300
像我?
Looking like me?

874
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,880
像个黑鬼?
Like a nigger?

875
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,090
为什么不用本来的面目
Why not look like what you are?

876
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,850
做黑种人有什么惭愧?
What makes you ashamed of being black?

877
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:05,520
让我告诉你 我没有惭愧什么
Let me tell you something. I'm not ashamed of being anything.

878
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,600
放开你的手 我要洗头
You better let go. I gotta wash this out.

879
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:14,820
- 让它烧着了 - 放手!
- Let it burn! - Nigger, get your hands off of me!

880
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,940
- 快点 灼伤你自己
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself.

881
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,030
去涂毒药在头上吧 去扮白种人吧!
Put all that poison in your hair, in your body, trying to be white!

882
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:27,200
- 我不想听你讲废话 - 我还以为你很聪明
- I don't want to hear this shit. - I thought you were smart.

883
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,830
可是你只是像猴子一样
But you just another cat strutting down the avenue

884
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,210
流浪接头的小混混
in your clown suit with all that mess on you!

885
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,630
简直就是猴子!
Looking like a monkey!

886
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,800
白种人耻笑你 因为知道你不是白种人
The white man sees you and laughs because he knows you ain't white.

887
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:41,340
- 你是谁? - 问题是 你是谁?
- Man, who are you? - No, the question is, who are you?

888
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,010
我告诉你
I'll tell you.

889
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,020
你在黑暗中迷失了
You are lost in the darkness.

890
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,730
但穆罕默德能使你重见光明
But Elijah Muhammad has come to bring you into the light.

891
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,610
- 谁? - 穆罕默德
- Who? - Elijah Muhammad

892
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,360
他能救你出监狱
can get you out of prison.

893
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,530
走出你心里的监狱
Out of the prison of your mind.

894
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,370
但可能你只想再扮白种人
But maybe all you want is another fix.

895
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,510
你习惯了这种生活 便意志消沉
You get used to this life, and it puts you to sleep.

896
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,550
你不再思考自己的行为
You stop thinking and acting for yourself.

897
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:30,180
在外乞讨 遍体鳞伤
If you had to scrounge 3 squares a day outside, you'd cut your throats.

898
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,520
所以你让他们喂你 给你玩纸牌
So you let them feed you, give you dominoes to play with.

899
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:37,150
- 让你射波子和打棒球 - 走吧 别讲道了
- Let you shoot marbles, play baseball. - Let's go. Cut the sermon.

900
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,190
他吹哨子你便坐 站 吃
He blows his whistle and you sit, you stand, you grab, gobble

901
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,400
狼吞虎咽
file out

902
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:46,780
- 睡觉和读出编号 - 我叫你住口
- sleep, and sing out your number. - I told you to knock it off.

903
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,040
现在
Now

904
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,960
去操场吗
are you gonna take yard?

905
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,630
我留在这里
I'm staying.

906
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,210
我也是
Uh, yeah, me too.

907
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,430
你在这里干什么?
What are you sniffing around for?

908
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,310
我说了 那杯是最后的了
I told you, I gave you your last fix.

909
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,400
你有什么本领 黑鬼?
What's your angle, nigger? Hmm?

910
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:23,110
黑鬼? 谁在装扮
"Nigger"? Who's wearing the conk?

911
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,410
你是这里唯一特别的人
You the only cat in this prison I done seen act the way you do.

912
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,870
你在守卫面前不会怕
You ain't afraid of talking like that in front of guards.

913
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,710
他会对我怎样?
What's he gonna do to me he hasn't done already?

914
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:39,880
我是说你不粗言秽语 你不会说你知道什么
I mean, you don't cuss none. You don't talk that "What- ya- know- daddy" jive.

915
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:43,920
人们讲粗口 因为他不知道怎样说话
A man curses because he doesn't have the words to say what's on his mind.

916
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,930
我知道你的确有些本领
I know you gotta angle some kind of way.

917
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,230
别骗我
Don't con me.

918
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,610
甚至别想骗我
Don't con me and don't try.

919
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:03,690
嘿 只是说你抽支烟 没什么的
Hey, just offering you a cigarette, my man. Ain't no big deal.

920
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,700
我读书 学习
I read, study.

921
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,870
黑种人先要尊重自己
The first thing a black man must have is self- respect.

922
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,290
尊重他们身体 思想
Respect his body and his mind.

923
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,080
不涂白种人的毒药在身上
Quit taking the white man's poisons into his body.

924
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:24,960
他们的烟 毒品 酒 女人 猪肉
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white women, his pork.

925
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,840
猪肉?
Pork?

926
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,390
我妈常说别吃猪肉
My mama used to say don't eat no pork.

927
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,020
你妈说得对 猪是污秽的怪兽
Your mama was right. That pig is a filthy beast.

928
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:41,650
是鼠 猫和狗的混合体
Part rat, part cat and the rest is dog.

929
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:44,230
再讲多点来听听
All right, pull my coat on this, now.

930
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,650
若不做这些又会怎样?
What happen if you give all that up?

931
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,530
我是说 若病了就去看医生
I mean, the pork. You get sick and you get a medical or something?

932
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,240
我在外面时招摇撞骗 我试过了
Like when I was on the outside, I ran this hustle. I tried

933
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,790
我告诉你神的说话 别骗人
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle.

934
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,830
我告诉你 神是黑种人
And I'm gonna tell you God is black.

935
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,920
神是黑种人? 大家都知神是白种人
God is black? Everybody knows God is white.

936
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:06,340
白种人教你的 你全部接受
Everything the white man taught you, you accepted.

937
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:09,340
教你你是黑种异族 你也相信
He taught you you were a black heathen, and you believed him.

938
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:12,350
教你信金发蓝眼
He taught you to worship a blond, blue- eyed Jesus

939
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:15,140
白皮肤的耶稣 你还是相信
with white skin and you believed him.

940
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,730
说黑色不好你又信
He taught you that black was a curse, and you believed that.

941
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,480
- 有查过"黑"这个字吗? - 是怎样解吗
- Ever look up the word "black"? - For what?

942
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,020
有读过关于 不骗人的东西吗?
Did you ever study anything that wasn't a con?

943
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:25,730
读用来干什么
What the hell for, man?

944
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:29,610
跟我来
Come with me.

945
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,040
黑 没有光
Black: Destitute of light

946
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,580
没有色彩
devoid of color.

947
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,580
处于阴暗里
Enveloped in darkness

948
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:42,210
变得暗淡
hence utterly dismal or gloomy

949

959
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,740
让我们再看看"白"
Let's look up "white."

This was written by white folks, right? White folks' book?

972
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:01,410

- Sure ain't no black man's book. - What we reading this for?

973
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,290
字里行间才是真相
Because the truth is lying there, if you read behind the words.

布鲁克林队有杰基・罗宾森!

996
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,780
是 好的

白种人向我们掷骨头
White man throw us a bone and we're supposed to forget

999
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,950
我们便要忘记四百年的压迫
400 years of oppression.

1000
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,200
是 但黑鬼

1002
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,210
叫过你看字里行间的真相
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth.

1003
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,420
他们让我们唱歌跳舞和欢笑
They let us sing and dance and smile

1004
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,920
允许黑种人打球
and then they let one so- called Negro into the majors.

1005
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,720
但也洗不去历史上最大的罪
That doesn't cancel out history's greatest crime.

1006
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:24,010
蓝眼睛的魔鬼 用锁炼锁着我们
When that grafted, blue- eyed devil locked us in chains

1007
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,430
我们一百万的同胞 无家可归

1008
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,060
被人折磨

1009
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:33,110
孤立我们的语言 宗教和历史
cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.

1010
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:37,190
我讲黑种人历史给你们听
Let me tell you about black history.

1011
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,990
我们才是世上原本的人
We are the original man.

1012
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,280
世上最先有的是黑种人 他们统治世界
The first men on earth were black. They ruled.

1013
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,290
根本没有白种人
And there wasn't a white face anywhere.

1014
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:49,120
他们说我们住在山洞 攀树
But they teach us that we swung from trees.

1015
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:52,630
那是谎话 我们从未住在山洞
That's a lie. Black men never did that.

1016
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,420
我们是国皇的血统
We were a race of kings when the white man

1017
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,710
当欧洲四方八面的白种人
crawled on all fours in Europe.

1018
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,970
他们知道自己是谁吗
Do they know who they are?

1019
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,800
知道自己从哪里来? 你叫什么吗?
Do you know where you came from? What's your name?

1020
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:06,890
- 马尔克姆 里特 - 不是
- Malcolm Little. - No.

1021
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,310
那是主人呼喝奴隶的名字
That's the name of the slave masters that owned your family.

1022
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,100
你根本不知自己是谁
You don't even know who you are.

1023
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,940
你什么都不是
You're nothing. Less than nothing.

1024
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,650
你是谁?
Who are you?

1025
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,360
我不是废人
Look, I ain't Shit, heh.

1026
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,840
好吧 我不是马尔克姆 里特
All right, I ain't Malcolm Little,

1027
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,500
更不是撒旦
or Red, or Satan.

1028
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:32,250
对 那你是谁?
That's right. So who are you?

1029
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,210
- 我不知道 - 我们是个国家
- I don't know. - We are a nation

1030
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,510
沙巴兹族
the tribe of Shabazz

1031
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,340
在北美洲迷失了
lost in this wilderness called North America.

1032
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,350
沙巴兹族
Tribe of Shabazz.

1033
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,980
真主派了使者来
The merciful Allah has sent us a messenger

1034
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,440
一个叫穆罕默德的黑种人
a black man named Elijah Muhammad.

1035
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,400
他教导我们认识自己
He reveals to us the true knowledge about ourselves.

1036
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,700
黑种人的本性是
He teaches that the true nature of the original man, the black man

1037
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,540
正义的
is righteousness.

1038
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,370
如果是的话
If the black man's nature is righteousness.

1039
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:15,330
那白种人的本性是奸狡的
Then the true nature of the white man is wickedness.

1040
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,080
我知道你明白
I knew you'd get it.

1041
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:21,210
穆罕默德教我们 白种人是魔鬼
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that the white man is a devil.

1042
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,880
我是遇过一些
I sure met some in my life.

1043
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,720
不
No.

1044
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:30,100
穆罕默德没说白种人是魔鬼
Elijah Muhammad does not say that some white men are devils.

1045
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,930
他说所有白种人都是魔鬼
He teaches us that all white men are devils.

1046
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,730
你有遇过好的白种人吗? 回想一下
Have you ever known a good white man? Think back in all your life.

1047
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:42,230
遇过一个不是魔鬼的白种人吗?
Have you ever met one who wasn't evil?

1048
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,040
身体是神圣的教堂
The body is a sacred temple

1049
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,500
一定要得到净化
it must be purified.

1050
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,920
我不会碰白种人的毒药
I will not touch the white man's poison:

1051
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,500
他的毒品
His drugs

1052
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,420
酒
his liquor

1053
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,590
猪
his swine

1054
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,930
和女人
his women.

1055
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,430
伊斯兰教徒要挺起胸膛
A Muslim must be strikingly upright

1056
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,430
一个好榜样
an outstanding example

1057
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,100
在黑暗的人 才能看到力量的光忙
so that those in the darkness can see the power of the light.

1058
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:21,480
我不会通奸
I will not commit adultery or fornication.

1059
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:24,740
不会说谎
I will not lie

1060
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,650
骗人或偷东西
cheat or steal.

1061
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:30,450
但关键是要服从
But the key to Islam is submission.

1062
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,460
所以一日祷告五次 然后到麦加朝圣
That is why five times daily, we turn to Mecca to pray

1063
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,170
跪下来服从
to bend our knees in submission.

1064
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,130
我做不到 贝恩斯
I can't do that, Brother Baines.

1065
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,930
他们必须跪下来
The lost, found, must bend their knees

1066
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,640
承认自己的过失
to admit their guilt.

1067
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:56,520
求真主的宽恕 是世上最困难的事
To implore Allah's forgiveness is the hardest thing on earth.

1068
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,820
最难但也是最伟大的
The hardest and the greatest.

1069
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,490
我不知道该对真主说什么
I don't know what I would say to Allah.

1070
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,490
你有曾跪下过吗
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?

1071
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,330
有 当我
Yes, when I was, uh

1072
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,880
在打劫撬锁时
When I was picking a lock to rob someone's house.

1073
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,130
告诉真主
Tell Allah that.

1074
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:41,020
你可求免罪 但不是救赎灵魂
You can grovel and crawl for sin but not to save your soul?

1075
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:43,230
来吧 马尔克姆
Pick the lock, Malcolm. Pick it.

1076
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,520
我想
I want to.

1077
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,160
神知道我想的
God knows I want to.

1078
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,880
那天我收到穆罕默德的来信
I received a letter that day from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1079
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:08,380
一封传教士写给我的
The dear Holy Apostle wrote to me

1080
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,380
酒鬼 妓女 罪犯的信
a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict.

1081
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:14,550
我给你
I have come to give you

1082
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,680
永远拥有的东西
something which can never be taken away from you.

1083
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:23,850
带给你自我的价值
I bring to you a sense of your own worth

1084
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,440
一个人的自我价值
the worth of one human being.

1085
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,150
自我的认识
The knowledge of self.

1086
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,820
就像恍然大悟
It was like a blinding light.

1087
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:34,660
我知道他在监房和我一起
I became aware that he was in the room with me.

1088
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,160
他穿着深色西装 面上有智慧和痛苦
He wore a dark suit, and on his face I saw a wisdom

1089
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:42,040
我差点看认不出他
and pain so old and deep that I could scarcely look at him.

1090
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,790
我知道不是在做梦 他和我一起
But I knew I wasn't dreaming. He was there with me.

1091
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,880
我告诉你
I tell you

1092
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,590
世上最危险的是
the most dangerous creation in the world

1093
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,220
在某个社会上
in any society

1094
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,390
一个人没东西可以失去
is the man with nothing to lose.

1095
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:03,560
要改变世界不需十个人
You do not need 10 such men to change the world.

1096
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,440
一个便够
One will do.

1097
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:10,440
地球是属于我们
The earth belongs to us

1098
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,070
黑种人
the black man.

1099
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,780
不论地球有什么
And whatever is around it

1100
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,950
外面还是里面
or on it, or in it

1101
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,290
都是属于我们的
belongs to us.

1102
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,620
他突然走了
And then as suddenly as he came

1103
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:23,960
像突然来一样
he was gone.

1104
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,670
我便做到了
And then I could do it.

1105
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,880
保罗去大马土革的途中
We're taught that Paul

1106
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:35,470
听到基督的声音
on the road to Damascus, heard the voice of Christ.

1107
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,680
他被真相吓得坠马了
He was so smitten by the truth that he fell from his horse.

1108
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:41,060
我不像保罗一样
Now, I don't liken myself to Paul

1109
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:42,980
但我真的明白
but I do understand.

1110
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,150
就是这样发生在我身上
You see, it happened to me.

1111
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,440
为什么是我?
Why me?

1112
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,090
亲爱的马尔克姆兄弟
Dear Brother Malcolm:

1113
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,900
我回到伊斯兰教的怀抱 赞美真主
I am back in the bosom of Islam, praise Allah.

1114
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:57,450
我们不大富有 只拥有你
We don't have much, but what we have is yours.

1115
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:01,540
我太太和儿子
My wife and my son join me in saying that when you come out

1116
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,080
都赞成你出来时 到我们的家来
which won't be long, come straight to us.

1117
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:05,660
下一个!
Next.

1118
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:13,090
想怎样剪 小子?
What'll it be, Little?

1119
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,180
剃光
Take it all off.

1120
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:18,840
- 剃光? - 是的
- Getting rid of that conk, huh? - Yes, sir.

1121
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:23,180
你写信感谢我
You write, thanking me.

1122
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:27,600
别感谢我 感谢真主 全是他功劳
Don't thank me, thank Allah. He did it all.

1123
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,940
亲爱的贝恩斯
Dear Brother Baines:

1124
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:35,860
请多谢穆罕默德那些钱
Please thank the Honorable Elijah Muhammad for the money

1125
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:38,360
告诉他我写信给他
and tell him I haven't written him

1126
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:40,530
因为我还没自我证实
because I've not yet proven myself.

1127
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:44,950
但我和哈莱姆的老友分享他教导
But I have shared his teachings with some old running buddies in Harlem

1128
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,580
还有被调北上的矮子
and with my main man, Shorty, who was transferred upstate.

1129
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:50,040
他疯了
He's gone nuts.

1130
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,710
亲爱的兄弟
Dear Brothers

1131
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,630
多谢你的时间和关心
I thank you for your time and concern.

1132
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:59,470
赞美真主 全靠穆罕默德
All praises due to Allah for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1133
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,510
我写信给市长 总督和总统
I wrote the mayor, the governor and the president

1134
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,020
但因某些原因 他们没回信
but for some reason, I haven't heard from them.

1135
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,440
告诉穆罕默德
Please tell the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

1136
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,730
我己献出一生 告诉白种人真相
that I have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face.

1137
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:18,030
给你我平淡的祝福 祝你平安
I greet you with the ancient words of peace, "As- Salaam- Alaikum."

1138
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:21,870
另外 我终于抄了整本字典
P.S. I finally copied out the entire dictionary.

1139
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:26,580
那位兄弟日渐进步
I think the brother is coming along.

1140
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,960
贼来了 不是来偷东西
The thief cometh not but for to steal

1141
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,920
来杀人和破坏的
and to kill, and to destroy.

1142
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:37,920
我来
But I am come

1143
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,220
因他们会有生命
that they might have life

1144
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:44,470
变得更有生命
and that they might have it more abundantly."

1145
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:49,770
《约翰福音》第十首特篇 有何问题?
Saint John 10, verse 10. Are there any questions?

1146
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,820
小心 那人对宗教很认真
Watch it, baby. This cat is heavy on religion.

1147
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,990
我看得出来这是正邪的斗争
I see this has become a struggle between good and evil.

1148
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,490
撒旦有问题要问
"Satan" has a question.

1149
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,200
我们不是神
Yes, sir. But since neither of us are God

1150
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,500
不可以说 什么是邪 什么是正
neither of us can say who's good and who's evil.

1151
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:11,960
快问吧
Just ask your question.

1152
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,790
我们在讨论门徒 门徒是什么人种?
We were discussing the Disciples. What color were they?

1153
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,510
噢 我想
Well, I don't think

1154
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,300
我们不可以确定
we know for certain.

1155
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,590
- 但他们是希伯来人 - 对
- But they were Hebrews? - That's right.

1156
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,850
耶稣也是希伯来人
As was Jesus. Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1157
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,600
有问题便问吧
Just ask your question.

1158
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,220
希伯来人本来是什么人种
What color were the Hebrews?

1159
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:32,900
我说过我们不能确定
I have told you that we don't know that for certain.

1160
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:37,190
那么你便不可深信耶稣是白种人
Then you can't believe for certain that Jesus was white.

1161
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,690
等等 等等
Just a moment. Just a moment.

1162
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,820
神是白种人 这不是很明显吗?
God is white. Isn't it obvious?

1163
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:46,870
但不可证明耶稣是白种人
That's obvious, but it's not obvious that God is white.

1164
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,700
穆罕默德告诉我们
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us

1165
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:51,500
耶稣不是金发蓝眼
that Jesus didn't have blond hair and blue eyes.

1166
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:54,250
他告诉导我们
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches that images of Jesus

1167
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:57,250
耶稣肖像的样子
in prisons and churches throughout the world

1168
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,170
并不与历史相符
are not historically correct.

1169
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,050
因为历史告诉我们
Because history teaches us

1170
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,430
他生于有色人种的地方
Jesus was born in a region where the people had color.

1171
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,180
你叫我们读圣经的启示录
There's proof in the Bible you ask us to read

1172
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:10,220
第十四 十五章清楚写明
in Revelations, first chapter, verses 14 and 15

1173
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,350
耶稣有狼的头发
that Jesus had hair like wool

1174
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,350
和厚皮的脚
and feet the color of brass.

1175
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,150
- 这些都是你说的? - 不是我说的
- What are you saying? - I'm not saying anything.

1176
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,320
只是想证明给你看 引我一位印度兄弟为例
I'm proving to you that Jesus was not, to quote an lndian brother

1177
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,030
他不是白色脸的
he was not a paleface.

1178
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,450
阿门
Amen.

1179
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,200
很有趣吗?
Isn't that interesting.

1180
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,040
马尔克姆
Brother Malcolm.

1181
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:35,710
马尔克姆
Brother Malcolm.

1182
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,210
他在等你
He's waiting for you.

1183
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,760
我的儿子
My son.

1184
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:31,600
你曾经是小偷
You have been a thief

1185
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:35,140
毒贩和骗子
a drug dealer and a hustler

1186
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,610
世上仍充满引诱
and the world is still full of temptation.

1187
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:48,950
当神对魔鬼说忠心
When God spoke to the devil about how faithful Job was

1188
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,490
魔鬼说那只是
the devil argued

1189
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,790
一道保护他
that it was only God's protective hedge around him

1190
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,370
令他纯洁的墙
that kept him pure.

1191
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,460
实际上 魔鬼说
In fact, the devil said:

1192
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:03,250
拆掉那束缚 他便会咀咒他的主
"Remove that hedge and he will curse his Maker."

1193
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,130
马尔克姆
Well, Malcolm

1194
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,800
你的束缚己拆卸了
your hedge has been removed.

1195
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,980
我相信
And I believe

1196
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:18,190
你
you

1197
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:20,810
会忠心的
will remain faithful.

1198
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,810
是
Yes, sir.

1199
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,160
谢谢 一共要多少?
Thank you, sister. How many of these should we make?

1200
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:32,410
- 五百 - 增至一千
- Five hundred. - Make it 1000.

1201
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,910
这是厄尔 刚接受了真主
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl. He just accepted the teachings.

1202
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,750
是
Yes, sir.

1203
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,710
他很给力 我们需要这样的人
Brother Earl's dedicated. We need good men like him.

1204
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,210
我愿为穆罕默德服务
I'm a willing servant for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

1205
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,340
继续努力
Go ahead, brothers. Keep it busy.

1206
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,630
看看你所住的地方
Take a real good look at not just where you live

1207
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,140
看你所有朋友所住的地方
but take a good look at where everybody you know lives.

1208
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:57,640
我不希望你觉得不好运
I don't want you to think you're some bad- luck accident.

1209
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:00,980
要你去中央公园
Then I want you to go downtown, to Central Park West

1210
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:05,320
- 看看他住的地方 - 去另一些社区
- and take a good look at how he lives. - Go in other communities.

1211
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,440
你从未看过华盛顿商店
You've never seen a Booker T. Washington linguine store

1212
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,070
在意大利的某个地方
in an Italian community.

1213
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,360
你未去过犹太人社区
You've never went in a Jewish community

1214
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:14,910
看过那些熟食店
and seen no Frederick Douglass delicatessen.

1215
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,660
为什么他们能赚钱 我们却不能?
Why's everybody in this community making money but us?

1216
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,870
现在是黑种人站起来
It's time for the black man and the woman to stand up

1217
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,080
控制自己的生命的时候了
and take control of our dollars.

1218
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:28,130
该是我们解放的时候了
It's time for us to use our dollars for our liberation.

1219
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:31,800
别人可做的我们也能做到
We can do what everyone else can do if we become producers

1220
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:34,970
要是我们成为控制命运的主人
and if we become the masters of our own destiny.

1221
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,890
我们也能拥有羊毛
We can have wool from sheep just like anyone else.

1222
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,020
但我们的时装在哪里?
But where are our clothing stores?

1223
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:44,520
我们有牛奶 但我们的店呢
We can get milk from cows, but where are our grocery stores?

1224
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:48,570
我们要控制我们的钱和命运
We need to control our dollars! We need to control our destiny!

1225
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,900
我们唯一被尊重的是钱
The only thing they respect is our dollars!

1226
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,410
我们给他的财富
The so- called freedom you and I should have.

1227
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,830
自由神像这样树立着
The Statue of Liberty standing like this.

1228
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,250
为我为你 还说 别走开
For us, it may as well say, "Stop, don't come no further."

1229
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:05,500
别走开
This is what he be saying, "Don't come no further."

1230
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:10,210
兄弟姐妹 我想你们来教堂宇
What I want you to do, brothers and sisters, I want you to come down to the temple.

1231
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,090
我真想不到!
Oh, I'm so surprised!

1232
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,010
我真想不到! 你在教堂待了两小时
I'm so surprised. Y'all been in church two hours

1233
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:19,310
希望见到天堂 但你仍然在这
and you're expecting to see heaven out here, and you're still here on earth.

1234
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,100
为什么你不在两点的时候来殿里呢?
Why don't you come on down to the temple at 2:00?

1235
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,560
你要听事实 黑种人的事实
You'll hear truth, the black man's truth.

1236
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:28,650
不 你不能拒绝 你跪了两小时求神帮你
No, you can't deny it. You been on your knees for the last two hours

1237
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,110
从此以后你就祈祷神帮你了
begging some God to help you in the hereafter.

1238
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,860
现在是时候了
But the hereafter is right now. The hereafter is here and now.

1239
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:36,780
我们谈一谈 兄弟
Let me talk to you, brother.

1240
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:39,870
我知道你是聪明人
I know you're a smart man and a wise man.

1241
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,120
你气色很好
You look good.

1242
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:44,660
你每天来这教堂祈祷
Now, you're in church every day, praying to this God.

1243
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,960
那些白种人基督徒
But these so- called white Christians

1244
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:49,920
把黑种人基督徒吊在树上
they're hanging our black Christians from trees.

1245
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:53,380
这个人恨你 但不会对你怎么样
This is the man that hates you. He doesn't do anything for you.

1246
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,930
他叫你张嘴唱歌
He tells you to foam at the mouth and sing

1247
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,970
他叫你一切靠祈祷 便得到一切
and hope for something in the hereafter. We can have it right now.

1248
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:02,430
- 两点钟来 - 回头见
- Come on down, 2:00. - See you later.

1249
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,850
是祝你平安的意思
As- Salaam- Alaikum. That means, "Peace be unto you."

1250
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:09,150
我们有两个孩子 小卡拉 两岁半
We have two children. Carla, who's 2 1/2, and.

1251
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,070
当我说你是黑人时 不需惭愧
Don't be ashamed when I call you black. You are.

1252
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:15,280
你是黑种人 你漂亮 黑种人就是漂亮
You're black and you're beautiful. Black is beautiful.

1253
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:18,820
你不需求别人给你工作
You don't have to come here begging these folks for a job.

1254
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:21,990
你可洗衣服 抹地
You can wash their clothes and scrub floors for them.

1255
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:25,410
一辈子哄婴儿睡觉
You can rock their little brats to sleep the rest of your life.

1256
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,170
你还一无所有
You'll still end up poor.

1257
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,380
你身处这广场
Yet you're here on the auction block being examined

1258
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:32,750
像猪马 或奴隶般被检验
like you're a horse or a slave.

1259
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,010
这才是你 漂亮的黑种人
You see this here? This is who you are. Beautiful.

1260
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,800
漂亮的黑种人奴隶 有自尊
Your beautiful black selves, with pride and dignity.

1261
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,720
事实上
In fact.

1262
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:45,430
我也希望你
I'd also expect you to work one Saturday every month

1263
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,350
每月有一个周六上班
and occasionally in the evening

1264
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:58,030
这是你和我要问的问题
See, these are the questions you and I have to ask:

1265
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,700
我们怎会这样
"How did we get this mind?"

1266
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:03,700
你不是美国人 而是巧合在美国出现的非洲人
You're not an American, but an African who happens to be in America.

1267
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,700
大家要明白这里的区别
You have to understand the difference.

1268
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:09,420
我们没有坐什么船来
We didn't come over on the navire, the Pinta and the whatchamacallit.

1269
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:13,420
我们不是登陆在普利茅斯
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock. Plymouth Rock landed on us.

1270
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:16,340
- 是的 - 普利茅斯登陆在我们身上
- Yes! - Landed right on top of us.

1271
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:19,890
矮子?
Shorty?

1272
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:22,550
是你吗?
Is that you, brother?

1273
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,730
这就是我谈论的 赞美真主
Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about, the slave mentality

1274
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:30,060
奴隶的想法 兄弟们和我都有这种想法
the slave mind. This brother and I, we had the slave mind.

1275
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:33,190
我们一起打劫 玩白种女人
We used to rob together. We used to sleep with white women.

1276
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,070
我们甚至一起坐牢
We even went to prison together.

1277
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:38,280
别大惊小怪 你也身处监狱
Don't be surprised. Some of you are still in prison

1278
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:39,910
思想里的监狱
prisons of your mind.

1279
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:42,160
站起来
Stand up, brother. Come on.

1280
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,240
他怕羞
The brother's a little shy.

1281
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,580
来吧 兄弟 给我个拥抱
Come on, brother. Give me a hug.

1282
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,500
好吧 好吧
That's all right, brother. That's all right.

1283
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:54,630
他仍然要电头发
Look, he's still got his hair fried.

1284
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,590
这正是奴隶的思想
That's the slave mind. That's the slave mind.

1285
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,930
这宣传真好 我从未听过这么好的
Red, that's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.

1286
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,010
不是宣传 是真相
No hype, brother. It's the truth.

1287
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,260
回教堂去再听一些
Come back to the temple and hear more.

1288
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:07,270
我不可以只记挂那些
I can't pay that shit no mind.

1289
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,850
你有什么记挂
You need to pay it all your mind. What mind you have left.

1290
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,440
放松 是我 矮子呀
Take it easy. This is me. Shorty.

1291
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,360
去那边转角
Let's go around the corner.

1292
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:19,240
我不再这样了 已经八年了
No, sir. Not anymore. I've been clean for eight years.

1293
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,070
- 八年? - 八年
- Eight years? - Eight years.

1294
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:25,280
问题是 我太爱猪脚和白种女人了
My trouble is, I love pigs feet and white women too much.

1295
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,790
我肯定不能成为伊斯兰教教徒
So I damn sure can't be no Muslim.

1296
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,920
只是因为你迷失了方向
That's because you're lost, brother. That's because you're lost.

1297
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,080
但我们可以为你找到
But we can find you.

1298
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:40,340
其他人怎么样了?
What do you hear about the old gang?

1299
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,430
有萨米的消息吗?
You heard about Sammy?

1300
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:47,140
死了 和一个比他年轻二十五岁的女人做爱时死了
Dead. Knocked over in bed with a chick 25 years younger than he was.

1301
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:50,430
袋里剩二万五千美元
Had 25 grand in his pocket, also.

1302
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:52,640
大概是他的幸运数字吧
Guess it was his lucky number.

1303
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,440
那么 那个
What about, uh?

1304
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,820
叫什么名?
What was that brother's name?

1305
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,480
凯迪拉克?
Cadillac?

1306
01:32:58,650 --> 01:32:59,730
也死了吗?
Gone too?

1307
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:04,110
染上海洛英 进过戒毒所五六次
Hooked on heroin. Been in and out of Lexington five or six times.

1308
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,740
- 索菲亚呢? - 嫁了给那个有钱的白种人
- Sophia? - Still happily married to that rich ofay.

1309
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,120
- 她嫁给了他? - 是的
- She married him? - She married him.

1310
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,040
为了钱
Went for the money.

1311
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:14,830
- 为了钱 - 谢谢 亲爱的
- The money. - Thank you, honey.

1312
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,170
最近没有见到阿奇
I haven't seen West lndian Archie.

1313
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:21,260
有消息说 他住在白朗斯附近
Grapevine says he's living somewhere in the Bronx.

1314
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:23,340
如果你想打电话给他的话
If you wanna call that living.

1315
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:27,140
- 见到你真好 - 我也是 瑞德
- It's been good seeing you. - Same here, Red.

1316
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,230
滚开 婊子!
Get the hell away from me, bitch!

1317
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,240
明天付钱给你
I'll pay you tomorrow!

1318
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,920
你好吗? 阿奇
How you doing, Archie?

1319
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,260
兄弟
My man, Red.

1320
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,430
过来
Come here, man.

1321
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,020
不 别起来 没事
No, don't get up. It's all right.

1322
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,110
真的
Is

1323
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,030
是你吗?
really you, Red?

1324
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:28,530
是 是我
Yes, it's me.

1325
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,700
我是来
I came to, uh.

1326
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,120
感谢你的
Just to thank you

1327
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,670
感谢你救我一命
for saving my life.

1328
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,510
当我回想起在哈林
When I think back to when we were on the streets of Harlem trying

1329
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:46,170
互相残杀
to gun each other down

1330
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,590
我不是想杀你
I wasn't going to shoot you, man.

1331
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:51,260
只是
It was

1332
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,390
我的手下想
just my rep.

1333
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,350
你知道吗?
You know?

1334
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,560
我只有我的手下
All I had was my rep.

1335
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:02,320
但现在
But now

1336
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:05,990
你告诉我这个
you tell me this.

1337
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:09,660
你当年真的有写下那号码
You did really have that number?

1338
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:13,330
我不知道 阿奇.
I don't know, Archie.

1339
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,700
根本不记得 这并不重要
I don't remember, and it's not important.

1340
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:19,750
重要的是 你能振作起来
The important thing now is to get you back on your feet.

1341
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:23,670
我有些潜力
You know, I have some angles

1342
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:27,470
但还未被发掘
ain't been figured yet.

1343
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,560
没事
It's all right.

1344
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,610
扶着我的手臂
Help me with my arm.

1345
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:47,360
我的手臂需要运动
I need to exercise my arm.

1346
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,160
好了些吗?
That's better?

1347
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:58,660
好了点
Yep. It feels good.

1348
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:00,920
好
Good.

1349
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,670
我们的女人怎么了?
What happened to our women?

1350
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,340
她们本可以成为医生 律师
Women who could've been doctors, or lawyers

1351
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:12,760
成为老师 母亲 谁来抚养孩子?
or teachers or mothers. Who'll raise our children?

1352
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,510
男人怎么了?
What happened to our men?

1353
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,930
本来是数学家 电机工程师 物理学家
Men who could've been mathematicians, electricians, uh, physicians.

1354
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,520
那小男孩该怎么办
What's the little boy gonna do

1355
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,770
当他找他坐牢的爸爸的时候?
when he's looking for his father, and his father's downtown in jail?

1356
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:26,360
小女孩在找妈妈
What'll the little girl do

1357
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:29,530
妈妈却在街上出卖自己的肉体

认为自己死了
You're dead, spiritually.

1362
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:41,370
人们认为你死了
You're dead to the knowledge of yourself and your people

1363
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,630
神也认为你死了

1364
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:47,210
各位兄弟姐妹 他应该跪下

1369
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:01,480
他该跪下来承认他的过失
He should get on his knees and say he's committed a crime.

1370
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:02,730
但他有没有那样做?
But does he do that?

1371
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:06,060
有没有? 没有 他蔑视你

贝恩斯 对不起

- But I'm a hard man on the women. - Are you?

1404

我们面对女人得很小心
We must be very careful when it comes to women.

1405
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,970
很多女人

听了坏人的话
Listening to the wrong men

1412
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:28,370
令她们变得虚伪 不可信

1413
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:30,920
男人也该谴责
And you men are to blame too.

1414
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:35,000
我们不保护 评价或支持他们
We don't protect, we don't, uh, value, we don't even support them.

1415
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:40,180
国家的建设 是由女人开始
See, the building of a new nation begins with the woman.

1416
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,430
因为妈妈

The message she gives that child, the child gives to the world,

1419
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,850
所以我们要很小心
so we have to be careful.

1420
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:53,400
至于选择配偶

1422
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:01,030
被他的女人所害
by the woman that slept in his arms.

1423
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,700
我该告诉她们

我们不相信独身生活
We don't believe in celibacy.

1428
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,630
伊斯兰教 教会我们

1429
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,590
若一个女人 适合一个男人

1432
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:25,930

她明白男人的本性是坚强的
she understands that man's essential nature is strong

并且支持他
and she's willing to support that.

1435
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:35,230
若她
And if she, uh

1439
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:45,530
我明白你所讲的了

I love sharing. This is the wonderful thing about Mr. Muhammad:

1449
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:15,980
当他和别人分享时 你会情不自禁的
When he gives you this knowledge, you can't help but to run out and share it

1450
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:18,480
对不起
Excuse me, um, Brother Minister

- 这里地方很大 - 是的
- It's a pretty big building and, uh, ha. - Oh, yes.

1454
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:29,490
对不起 要你整天站着
Sister, I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet all day.

1455
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:31,000
不是
Oh, no. No, no.

1456
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:32,330

你己站了很多天了

谈谈你的事吧

你有多高?
How tall are you?

1461
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,810
问这个干什么?
Why do you ask?

1462
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,680
随便问问
Idle question.

1463
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:55,190
只是随便问问的话 那么希望你不要追问
Well, if it's just an idle question, I hope you won't force me to answer.

1464
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:58,860
我不会逼你
No, I won't force you.

1465
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:03,440

Well.

01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:07,530
贝恩斯说 我能配一个长得高的男人
Brother Baines says that I'm tall enough for a tall man.

1467
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:11,080
他曾那样说?
He's briefed you also?

1468
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:13,370
你多少岁?

女人有些事
You know, there are a few things about women

1470
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:19,670
你不会明白
that you don't understand.

1471
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:23,170
有些女人 占有欲很强
Some of us, we're quite possessive, very vain

1472
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:24,380
你呢?
Are you?

1473
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,220
决定了就一意孤行
and persistent when we've set our mind to something.

1474
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,220
你决定了做什么?
What have you set your mind to?

1475
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:34,100

01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:42,230
马尔克姆兄弟?
Brother Malcolm?

1479
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,990
- 对不起 - 没关系

1480
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:46,820
约翰逊兄弟被警察打了

1481
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:49,780
失陪了
Excuse me.

1482
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:51,830
- 混战 - 他只是看
- A scuffle. - He was just watching.

1483
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,330
- 警察说 走 - 他走得不够快
- The cop said, "Move on!" - He didn't move quick enough for him.

1484
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,750
他不断流血
Crack! He was bleeding like a stuck hog.

1485
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,130
你会怎样做?
So, what you gonna do?

1486
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,750
他是伊斯兰教徒
He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim!

1487
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,880
但你只懂演讲
But you ain't gonna do nothing but make a speech.

1488
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:10,600
伊斯兰教徒只懂空谈 没有实际行动
Muslims talk a good game, but they never do nothing

1489
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,810
到教徒出了事才会做些事
unless somebody bothers Muslims.

有两人见到约翰逊进了来 没出过去
Two witnesses saw Johnson brought here beat up, but not brought out.

1497
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:56,310

1503
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:37,600

1504
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:40,180
- 必须的 - 但你不能见他
- Must have. - But you can't see him.

1505
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:42,940
- 因为你不是他的律师 - 不是律师就不能见
- Because you ain't his lawyer. - No lawyer, no see.

1506
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:47,530
约翰逊要接受治疗
Until I'm satisfied that Brother Johnson is receiving proper medical care

1507
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:49,360

把人群驱散开来
Move these people out of here.

Fruit of Islam are disciplined men. They haven't broken any laws yet.

若约翰逊死了 便太可悲了
But if Brother Johnson dies, I pity you.

1519
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,170
医生?
Doctor?

1525
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:55,730
一个人有这能耐足够了
That's too much power for one man to have.

1526
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:59,070
牧师 我己准备好了
Brother Minister, I'm ready to take some heads.

1527

我们要那些魔鬼感到害怕

1528
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:05,950
我也准备好了 芝加哥那边说要忍耐
I'm ready to do something also. The word out of Chicago was to be patient.

1529
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:09,040
- 我厌倦忍耐了 - 那么你去打电话
- I'm tired of being patient. - Then you get on the phone

1530
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:12,580

他们的摄影机

很肮脏
It's dirty water.

1580

不纯洁的水
Foul.

1581
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:32,360
如果你给人们这杯水
If you offer this to the people

1582
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:34,410
他们没得选择

他们会喝的
They'll drink from it

1584

这个杯子

1587
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:50,170
让他们自己作决定
and let them make their own decision

1588
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:54,260
那他们会选择纯洁的 干净的水喝

1589
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:57,720
伊斯兰教是

及犹太人区
ghettos.

1595
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:15,570
伊斯兰教是唯一远离毒品 罪恶
Islam is the only way out for drugs and crime

1596
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:17,990

1600
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:27,500
我所跪的这位绅士
This sweet gentle man

1601
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:30,880
从他的口中给我真理
at whose feet I kneeled gave me the truth from his own mouth.

1602
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:32,590
给他们这杯纯洁的水
Present them the pure vessel.

1603
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:36,890
我喜爱他 拉丁文意思
I adored him in the sense of the Latin root of the word adorare

1604
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:39,140
是敬畏
which means to worship and to fear.

1605
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,520
他是我第一个敬畏的人
He was the first man I ever feared.

1606
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:44,350
不像枪那么可怕
I don't mean fear such as one has of a gun

1607
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,360
但害怕拥有能力的人
but the fear one has of the power of the sun.

1608

我愿意这样做 即使要付出生命

今天我们面对的难题便不会出现

就像把神的面孔改变成
that it was God- like to turn the other cheek

1724
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,660
妖兽来残害我们

02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,980
"黑种人伊斯兰教徒 煽动仇恨者"
"The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers"

1759
02:02:48,690 --> 02:02:52,280
你可以为我们解释你名字的意义
would you mind explaining for us the meaning of your name

1760
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:54,610
你有马尔克姆之称?
which is the letter "X"?

1761
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:58,410
是 在奴隶时代
Yes, uh, during slavery time, the slave master

1762
02:02:58,620 --> 02:03:01,120
奴隶主称黑种人为黑奴
gave the Negro So- called Negro

1763
02:03:01,330 --> 02:03:04,500
沿于自己的名称
Named the so- called Negro after themselves.

1764
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:07,330
敬爱的穆罕默德教导我们
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us

1765
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:11,250
当我们接受了伊斯兰教的知识后 对自我有认识
that once we come into the knowledge of Islam, the knowledge of ourselves

1766
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:14,090
我们要以埃克斯代替奴隶姓名
we replace our slave name with an "X"

1767
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:17,180
在数学上埃克斯代表未知数
"X" in mathematics representing the unknown.

1768
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:20,550
因为我们在历史 文化和土地上
Since we've been disconnected, or cut off from our own history

1769
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:23,720
被孤立了出来
our own past, our own culture, our own land

1770
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:27,640
我们用埃克斯等于未知数 直到我们可以返回我们的国家
we use the "X," the unknown, until we get back to our country.

1771
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:31,150
原来如此 谢谢 佩森医生
I see. Thank you. Uh, Dr. Payson?

1772
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,980
埃克斯先生是个煽动者
Mr. X is a. He's a demagogue.

1773
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:36,990
他没地方可去 所以他要夸大
He has no place to go, so he exaggerates.

1774
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:39,200
这国家中的每个守法的
He's a disservice to every good

1775
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:42,490
去教堂的 好的黑种人的危险
law- abiding, church- going American Negro in the country.

1776
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:45,700
马尔克姆・埃克斯先生
Mr. Malcolm X

1777
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:49,670
你为何教黑种人
why do you teach black supremacy?

1778
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,840
为什么 为什么你要教导憎恨
Why? Why do you teach hate?

1779
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,500
因为白种人
Well, for the white man

1780
02:03:54,670 --> 02:03:57,170
要问黑种人
to ask the black man

1781
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,090
为何他憎恨他
why he hates him

1782
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:03,220
那就像狼问羊 强奸犯问被奸的人
is like the wolf asking the sheep, or the rapist asking the raped

1783
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:04,470
"你憎恨我吗"
"Do you hate me?"

1784
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:08,310
白种人没有道德地指责黑种人什么什么
The white man is in no moral position to accuse the black man of anything.

1785
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,480
这是黑种人所问的
This is a black man asking the question.

1786
02:04:10,690 --> 02:04:14,860
你怎样叫一个受了教育 得了学士或博士学位的黑种人
What would you call an educated Negro with a B.A., an M.A., a B.S. or a Ph.D.?

1787
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:18,530
他叫他黑鬼 那就是白种人所做的
You call him a nigger. That's what the white man calls him.

1788
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:20,910
你要明白这种想法
You have to understand this thinking.

1789
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:24,740
明白这种人 一定要以历史方式去明白
To understand this type of man, you must understand that historically

1790
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:28,620
有两类奴隶 家仆黑奴及田里的黑奴
there were two types of slaves: the house Negro and the field Negro.

1791
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:30,620
在地下室或
The house Negro lived in the house

1792
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:34,500
阁楼可以找到
next to his master, in the big house, in the basement or the attic.

1793
02:04:34,710 --> 02:04:37,460
他穿好的 吃好的
He dressed good, he ate good, what the master left him.

1794
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:39,300
他爱他的主人
He loved his master.

1795
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:42,720
他爱主人的程度甚至比主人自己还更爱
He loved his master better than the master loved himself.

1796
02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:44,650
若主人说我们有间好房子
If master said, "We got a nice house,"

1797
02:04:44,650 --> 02:04:47,220
他会说是的 我们有间好房子
you say, "Yeah, boss, we got a nice house."

1798
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,980
主人的屋失火了
Master's house caught on fire, the house Negro

1799
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,690
家仆黑奴会去救火
would put the blaze out.

1800
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:55,440
如果主人病了 他会说 什么事 我们病了吗?
If the master got sick, he'd say, "What's the matter, boss? We sick?"

1801
02:04:55,610 --> 02:04:58,280
这是家仆黑奴的想法
"We sick"! This is the thinking of the house Negro.

1802
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:00,070
如果有另一个奴隶向他说
If another slave said to him:

1803
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:03,280
我们走吧 我们逃脱这残酷的主人吧
"Let's run away, let's separate from this cruel master"

1804
02:05:03,490 --> 02:05:06,410
他会说为什么 我们在这里是最好的
he said, "Why? What's better than what we got here?

1805
02:05:06,620 --> 02:05:08,950
我那里都不去 这是家仆黑奴
I'm not going anywhere." This is the house Negro.

1806
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,120
在那时 我们叫他做家仆黑奴
In those days, we called them house niggers.

1807
02:05:11,290 --> 02:05:15,380
以往叫他做黑鬼 因为我们这里仍有很多家仆黑奴
That's what we call them today because we still got a lot of house niggers.

1808
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,460
亲爱的传教士
Dear Holy Apostle

1809
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:22,590
牧师认为马尔克姆说得太多了
the ministers think Malcolm is getting too much press.

1810
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:26,510
他们认为他是伊斯兰国的
They think he thinks he is the Nation of Islam.

1811
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:31,060
他渴望领导国家
That he has aspirations to lead the Nation.

1812
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:35,020
你一手制造出马尔克姆的
It was you who made Malcolm the man he is.

1813
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:36,730
你把他高举进黑暗中
You lifted him out of darkness.

1814
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:38,530
你
You.

1815
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:42,950
你去告诉兄弟们
You go and tell the brothers

1816
02:05:43,700 --> 02:05:45,450
牧师所做的
that what the Brother Minister

1817
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:47,660
己经做的
is doing, has done

1818
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:52,370
己经对国家作出伟大的贡献
has been of great benefit to the Nation.

1819
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:54,580
你告诉他们 那是我说的
And you tell them that I say so.

1820
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:57,420
牧师认为他只是为自己
The ministers think he is of great benefit to himself.

1821
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:08,050
逐个逐个问
One at a time.

1822
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:10,140
你是否说白种人是恶魔?
Did you say white people are devils?

1823
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:11,310
对 我说白种人是恶魔的
I said they're devils.

1824
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,310
所有黑种人该武装吗?
Should all blacks be armed, sir?

1825
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,850
你们一位有名的人说过
Well, one of your most famous men said:

1826
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:19,610
向主祈祷 便逃过大难 如果那是你的想法
"Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition." That's the way you think.

1827
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:22,150
你认为你会成功吗
Do you think your cause will be successful?

1828
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:23,650
我希望是
I sincerely hope so.

1829
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:26,160
- 你拥护暴力吗? - 不
- Do you advocate violence? - No, sir.

1830
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:28,580
在历史上有白种人帮过你们吗
Has a white man helped your people?

1831
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:31,330
有白种人帮过黑种人吗?
Has there been a white man that's helped my people?

1832
02:06:31,540 --> 02:06:33,750
- 有 - 我不明白这问题
- Correct. - I don't understand the question.

1833
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:36,120
你提倡反对白种人 反对基督科学
You preach anti- white, anti- Christian science.

1834
02:06:36,330 --> 02:06:38,210
你说你反对白种人?
You're saying you're anti- white?

1835
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:41,380
- 不是 是你说的 - 所有白种人也是邪恶的吗?
- No, you're saying it. - Are all white people devils?

1836
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:45,170
我们要走了 赶着上机
We've gotta move out. We've got a plane to catch.

1837
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:50,930
埃克斯先生请留步
Excuse me, Mr. X? Um.

1838
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:53,020
我己读过你的一些言论
I've read some of your speeches

1839
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:56,940
我很相信你所说的是事实
and I honestly believe that a lot of what you have to say is true.

1840
02:06:57,150 --> 02:07:00,190
无论我祖先做了什么 我就是个好人
I'm a good person in spite of what my ancestors did.

1841
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,480
我想问你
I just wanted to ask you

1842
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:05,530
像我这样没有偏见的白种人
what can a white person like me, who isn't prejudiced

1843
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:09,320
怎么样可以帮你们?
what can I do to help you and further your cause?

1844
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:10,620
没有方法
Nothing.

1845
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:20,540
我的高中是黑种人居住区
My high school was a black ghetto

1846
02:07:20,750 --> 02:07:22,920
在波士顿的罗斯拔尼
in Roxbury, right here in Boston.

1847
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,380
我在纽约市的哈林读完大学
I got my college education on the streets of Harlem in New York City.

1848
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:32,720
我在狱中取得硕士学位 花了我六年半时间
I took my master's degree in prison, over the course of 6 1/2 years.

1849
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:34,180
事实上
In fact

1850
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:38,060
我以前的偷窃记录就在这校园的外面
my old burglary hangout was just outside this campus.

1851
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:40,270
我像动物般的生活
I lived like an animal.

1852
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:42,610
我偷东西
I stole.

1853
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:44,730
吸毒
I used drugs.

1854
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:48,780
我吸食麻药香烟 可卡因
I smoked reefers, cocaine.

1855
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:52,780
我犯上通奸 若不是有尊贵的穆罕默德
I committed adultery. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

1856
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:56,410
那我肯定进了疯人院或死了
I'd have surely been in an insane asylum or dead

1857
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,330
或可能杀了你们其中一个
or possibly even a murderer of one of you.

1858
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:03,750
穆罕默德先生做了什么? 他带我们进入了神的国度
So, what is Mr. Muhammad trying to do? He's trying to get us on God's side

1859
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,670
神才可帮助我们战斗
so that God will be on our side and help us fight our battles.

1860
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:10,720
当那所谓黑种人进入了神的国度
When the so- called Negro in America gets on God's side

1861
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:13,510
听从神圣穆罕默德的教导
and listens to the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

1862
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:17,140
他想脱离毒品 远离罪恶
he'll want to get off of drugs and get away from a life of crime.

1863
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:20,020
他想远离通奸
He'll want to get away from committing adultery.

1864
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:23,110
他想要幸福 赚钱过生活
Then he'd want to get off welfare. He'd want a job

1865
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:26,900
照顾他的家庭 然后他的家人会尊敬他
to take care of his family. And his family would respect him.

1866
02:08:27,110 --> 02:08:29,570
他儿子会说 我为父亲而自豪
His son will say, "I'm proud that that's my father."

1867
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:32,490
他妻子会说 我为丈夫而自豪
His wife will say, "I'm proud that that's my husband."

1868
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:37,330
父亲 只代表着照顾你的孩子
"Father" only means that you're taking care of your children. That's what it is.

1869
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:40,540
父亲 不代表你有孩子
"Father" doesn't mean that you're having some babies.

1870
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:44,290
那不会令你成为父亲 任何人也可出去找女人
That doesn't make you a father. Anybody can go out and get a woman.

1871
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:47,460
但不是人人可照顾那女人
But not anybody can take care of that woman.

1872
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:50,380
用另一个词语来说是"责任"
There's another word for it. It's called "responsibility."

1873
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:55,430
如果在美国的黑种人是真正的美国公民
If the so- called Negro in America was truly an American citizen

1874
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:57,640
我们便没有种族问题
we wouldn't have a racial problem.

1875
02:08:57,810 --> 02:09:00,890
如果解放的宣告是真实的
If the Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, we wouldn't have a race problem.

1876
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,690
如果宪法的修改是真实的
If the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments

1877
02:09:03,900 --> 02:09:06,650
我们便不会有种族问题
were authentic, we wouldn't have a race problem.

1878
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:09,820
如果最高法院废除了种族歧视
If the Supreme Court desegregation decision were authentic

1879
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:12,110
我们便不会有种族问题
we wouldn't have a race problem.

1880
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:15,280
我们看这所有全是伪善的
But you have to see that all of this is hypocrisy.

1881
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:18,200
这些黑人领袖正告诉白种人没事了
These Negro leaders are telling the white man

1882
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:21,250
我们己控制了一切
that everything's all right, we got it under control.

1883
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:24,130
穆罕默德所教的一切是错的
That everything the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches is wrong.

1884
02:09:24,330 --> 02:09:27,840
穆罕默德先生说这些会过去的
Mr. Muhammad said these things were gonna come to pass

1885

1886
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:35,390
现在同一群黑人领袖
Now these same Negro leaders

1887

1889
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:49,860
这比原子弹爆发更危险
And a racial explosion is more dangerous than an atomic explosion.

1890
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:56,490
会有爆发 因为黑种人不满足
There's going to be an explosion because black people are dissatisfied

1891
02:09:56,700 --> 02:09:58,460
他们不只是不满意白种人
not only with the white man,

1892
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:00,870
也不满意黑人领袖汤姆叔叔
but with these Uncle Tom Negro leaders

1893
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:04,620
那些领袖假扮代我们说话

火药库

If the thing that's going to explode is sitting inside the house

1899
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:20,720
如果那爆炸了 房子便被毁去
and if it explodes, then the house is going to be destroyed.

1900
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:23,730

让黑种人拥有自己的屋

1905
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:38,530
让黑种人拥有自己的土地和物业

Wake up! Are you so committed that you've blinded yourself?

1983

你献身得使你不能面对事实吗
You're so dedicated, you can't face the truth?

1984
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:26,920

贝恩斯在做什么
What is this Baines? Baines!

1991
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:49,820
你盲目了 除了你所有人都明白
You're so blind! Everyone can see this but you!

别向我大叫!

那么我们的孩子呢? 我呢?

我们甚至没有自己的人寿保险

2009
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:45,170
伊斯兰国家会提供给你的 如果我发生了什么事
The Nation will provide for you if anything happens to me

2010

你肯定吗
Are you sure?

2012
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,390
还是你己盲目了吗
Or are you blind?

2013
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:02,310
好吧
All right.

睁开你的眼睛

2025
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:40,890
你可终日面对死亡 但从没有人想过
You can face death 24 hours a day, but the possibility of betrayal

2026
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:43,270
别人会背叛你

2038
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:05,520
从他们口中 我听到谁冒充他们孩子的父亲
From their own mouths, I heard who had fathered their children.

2039
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:08,980
从他们口中听到尊贵的穆罕默德
And from their own mouths I heard that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad

2040
02:20:09,150 --> 02:20:11,940
- 己告诉了他们我是最好的 - 他经常提到你
- had told them I was his best. - He often spoke of you.

2041
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,650
他爱你正如你是他的儿子一般
He loves you like you were his own son.

2042
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:18,030
他是最伟大的牧师 但终有一天我会离开他
The greatest minister he had, but that I would leave him

2043
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:21,490
反对他 所以我很危险
turn against him. And so I was dangerous.

2044
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:24,370
尊贵的穆罕默德当着面赞颂我时
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, while praising me to my face

2045
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:26,040
和他说的 关于我的
And he said that about me?

2046
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:28,500
其实在背后撕开心
was tearing me apart behind my back.

2047
02:20:28,750 --> 02:20:31,040
- 你对此肯定吗? - 肯定
- You're sure about all this? - Yes, I am.

2048

我只想养大我的三个孩子
All I want is support for my three children

2049
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:37,510
尊贵的穆罕默德会供给他们的食物
that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad provide for them.

2050
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,550
那就是我所想要的
That's all I want.

2051
02:20:42,010 --> 02:20:44,050
真主会提供

2052
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:48,730
给我们全部
for all of us.

2053
02:20:49,060 --> 02:20:54,110
你在说什么 引退? 或许一些兄弟会嫉妒
What are you talking about, blackout? Perhaps some brothers are a little jealous.

2054
02:20:54,270 --> 02:20:57,480
或许他们认为你己有太多言论

你认识我们的人

他们想令他们的领袖有光明前路

2060
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:14,500
一只手清洗另一只手
One hand washes the other.

2061
02:21:15,090 --> 02:21:18,300
我告诉你神的话 不是招数
"I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle."

2062
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:22,840
记得你在狱中说的吗
Remember what you told me in prison?

2063

一间新房?
A new house?

2067
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:40,650
钱 是不是?
It's the money, isn't it?

2068
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:49,620
我告诉整个世界我们是道德领袖
But we tell the whole world that we're moral leaders

2069
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:51,750
因为我们跟从
because we follow

2070
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:55,000
穆罕默德的典范
the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2071
02:21:55,210 --> 02:21:57,340
穆罕默德是一个人

2072
02:21:58,250 --> 02:21:59,510
你也是

2073
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:02,420
- 你认识圣经吗 - 你呢

2074
02:22:02,590 --> 02:22:04,510
大卫和巴沙白上床
David slept with Bathsheba

2075
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:07,100
但他记得杀死巨人

贝恩斯兄弟曾是个骗子
Brother Baines is a two- bit hustler,

2079
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:22,650
但一只手可用来清洁另一只手
but one hand washes the other.

2080
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:25,780
伟大的人的行为可盖过他的弱点

2081
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:28,330
现在谁要核仁 兄弟?

2082
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:31,080
- 贝恩斯 我不会 - 小心 马尔克姆
- I'm not gonna allow - Be careful, Malcolm.

2083

2087
02:23:16,370 --> 02:23:18,460
我不惊讶
I'm not surprised.

2088
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,750
我们在真主保佑下
I have built this Nation

2089
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:25,260
建立了这国家
under the divine guidance of Allah.

2090
02:23:26,050 --> 02:23:30,010
他把我从死亡中带回来 带领我的子民

把我的种子 种在肥沃的泥土中
plant my seed in fertile soil.

2095
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:47,360
那是
It is only

2096
02:23:48,030 --> 02:23:51,030
先知的要求
the fulfillment of prophecy.

2097
02:23:51,410 --> 02:23:55,250
我的信念以一种 我不能形容的方式粉碎了
My faith had been shattered in a way I can never fully describe.

2098
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:58,250
我十二年来和穆罕默德先生一起

2099
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:00,960
我己准备为他献出生命
I'd been ready to lay down my life for him.

2100
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:04,800
对我来说反叛比死亡更糟糕
The thing to me that is worse than death itself is betrayal.

2101
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:08,880
我能接受死亡 但不能接受反叛
I could conceive death, but I couldn't conceive betrayal.

2102
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:13,510
不是因为我曾献出忠心
Not of the loyalty I gave to the Nation of Islam and Mr. Muhammad.

2103
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:17,060
过去的十二年里 如果穆罕默德先生犯了任何死罪
During the previous 12 years, if Mr. Muhammad had committed any crime

2104
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:21,150
我会证明及承认那是我做的
punishable by death, I would have tried to prove I did it

2105
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,650
来救他
to save him.

2106
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:26,230
我乐意替穆罕默德坐电椅受死
I would have gladly gone to the electric chair in his place.

2107
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:31,070
早晨起来
"Up in the mornin'"

2108
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:35,240
出去工作
"Out on the job"

2109
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:40,210
我的工作像魔鬼
"I work like the devil"

2110
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:42,460
为了薪水
"For my pay"

2111
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:44,460
他说了什么?
What did he say?

2112
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:50,510
我知道 幸运的旧太阳
"I know that lucky old sun"

2113
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:54,810
- 对不起 - 不需要道歉
- I'm so sorry. - There's nothing to be sorry about.

2114
02:24:55,470 --> 02:24:58,140
只是我有很多工作要做
I just got a lot of work to do, that's all.

2115
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:03,610
你怎么还能工作?
How can you work?

2116
02:25:03,820 --> 02:25:06,070
因为我们要教导
Because we have to teach.

2117
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:10,240
我们要教导人 教授所罗门 摩西斯
We gotta teach the people. We gotta teach on Solomon, Moses

2118
02:25:10,570 --> 02:25:13,490
大卫 所罗门有七百个妻子
David. Solomon had 700 wives.

2119
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:17,120
一个男人的好行为 会盖过他的任何行为
A man's good deeds, they far outweigh any of his.

2120
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:20,500
我父亲以前说过

2121
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:23,960
日出后你不能阻止鸡叫

2122
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:25,840
太阳升起来了
Well, the sun is up.

2123
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:31,130
我知道 幸运的旧太阳
"I know that lucky old sun"

2124
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:35,970
他无所事事
"Has nothin' to do"

2125
02:25:38,850 --> 02:25:39,980
只是绕圈子
"But roll around"

2126
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:43,730
天堂不休息
"Heaven all day"

2127
02:25:48,610 --> 02:25:53,570
我在这国家哀悼日说了什么
So, what do I say about this so- called national day of mourning?

2128
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:57,450
我说是白种人的暴力行为
I say the white man's acts of violence should be condemned

2129
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:59,580
该被他自己及其信念所咒骂
by our beliefs and by his own.

2130
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:02,580
可兰经教导我们做坏事的人
The Koran teaches us that those who work evil

2131
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:07,500
会根据他们的坏事而受到责骂和惩罚
will be condemned, punished or judged according to their works.

2132
02:26:07,710 --> 02:26:10,920
圣经说种瓜得瓜 种豆得豆
The Holy Bible teaches us that you reap what you sow.

2133
02:26:11,130 --> 02:26:12,590
这是神的裁决
This is divine justice.

2134
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:16,640
在美国的泥土中 白种人种下了仇恨的种子
In the Americas' soil, the white man has planted seeds of hatred

2135
02:26:16,850 --> 02:26:18,720
种下了暴力的种子
the seeds of violence.

2136
02:26:18,930 --> 02:26:21,520
他准许那些种子的生长
He's allowed those weeds to grow up and choke

2137
02:26:21,730 --> 02:26:25,310
过去四百年将黑种人扼毙了
the lives of millions of black men and women for 400 years

2138
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:28,820
印度人过去五百年的生活
and the lives of Indians in these Americas for 500 years.

2139
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:34,240
现在同样的种子令花农窒息 他是主要的花农
And now those same weeds have choked one of his own gardeners, his chief gardener.

2140
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:37,700
你问我说的话 我所说的是圣经所说的
You ask me what I say. I only say what the Bible says.

2141
02:26:37,950 --> 02:26:40,200

我说那是正义
I say it's justice.

2143
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:50,090
你不觉得懊悔吗?
Don't you even feel a bit of remorse

2144
02:26:50,250 --> 02:26:52,800
肯尼迪总统被行刺后
saddened by President Kennedy's assassination?

2145
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:56,260
我不认为有人会否认
I don't think anyone would deny that when you send chickens

2146
02:26:56,470 --> 02:26:58,260
当你在早上放出你的小鸡
out from your barnyard

2147
02:26:58,470 --> 02:27:02,020
它们便会在晚上回到你身边 而不会去到的邻居那边
those chickens will return to your barnyard, not your neighbor's.

2148
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:05,560
我认为这是魔鬼的 小鸡总会回到枝头的家中
It's an example of the devil's chickens coming home to roost.

2149
02:27:05,730 --> 02:27:08,770
他派出去的小鸡在 这里及外地所犯的暴力
The violence that he's perpetrated here and abroad

2150
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:12,900
便是在伯明罕的四个孩子
be it four children in Birmingham, or Medgar Evers, or in Africa

2151
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:15,610
同样的暴力己招致应得的报应
this same violence has claimed one of their own.

2152
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:19,740
作为一个年老的农人 小鸡的回巢不会令我感忧愁
Being a farm boy, chickens coming home to roost never made me sad.

2153
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:21,540
那只会令我高兴
In fact, it's only made me glad.

2154
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:32,500
你
Did you

2155
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:36,010
有看今天的报纸吗
read the paper today?

2156
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,430
有
Yes, sir. I did.

2157
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:48,650
那就是你做的陈述
That was a bad statement you made.

2158
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:54,440
你知道我的指示
You knew from my instructions

2159
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:59,610
没有一个牧师可以反抗这人
no minister was to make any statements against this man.

2160
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:02,370
国家爱这个人
The country loved this man.

2161
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:04,540
你已经
You have made it

2162
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:06,120
令
hard

2163
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,620
伊斯兰教徒很难受
for Muslims

2164
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,880
总括来说
in general.

2165
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,500
是的
Yes, sir.

2166
02:28:14,710 --> 02:28:19,510
我们不可惹上
We must disassociate ourselves

2167
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:22,010
对头人
from your terrible blunder.

2168
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:26,560
我要静化你
I must silence you.

2169
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:29,060
九十天
For 90 days

2170
02:28:30,310 --> 02:28:36,320
你肯定不可以向外发表言论
you must not make any statements to the press

2171
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:41,410
或在任何教堂中作演说
nor are you to speak at any temples.

2172
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:43,910
知道
Yes, sir.

2173
02:28:45,490 --> 02:28:48,410
我百份百服从
Yes, sir. I submit 100 percent.

2174
02:29:46,890 --> 02:29:47,970
让我们静静
Leave us alone.

2175
02:29:49,060 --> 02:29:51,270
- 贝蒂? - 让我们静静 别再打电话来
- Betty? - Leave us alone. Stop calling here.

2176
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:54,900
谁主使你来? 我们在这里有孩子
Who's putting you up to this? We have children here!

2177
02:29:55,230 --> 02:29:56,650
停止!
Stop it!

2178
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:10,750
没事了
It's all right.

2179
02:30:11,250 --> 02:30:12,910
他们不断打来
They keep calling.

2180
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:15,920
他们总是打
They keep calling.

2181
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:19,800
叫
Just

2182
02:30:21,510 --> 02:30:23,590
他们睡吧
take the babies and put them to bed.

2183
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:26,590
来 我们现在上床了
Come on, babies. Let's go to bed now.

2184
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:28,760
- 睡觉时间了 - 来吧

2185
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:30,770
来吧

2186
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:35,690

- 晚安 西德尼 - 晚安
- Good night, Sidney. - Night- night.

2188
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:53,620
牧师兄弟 我要坦白对你说
Brother Minister, I have to level with you.

2189
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:56,460
他们给了我任务
They gave me a mission

2190
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,290
但我做不到
but I couldn't do it.

2191
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:01,920
- 我爱你 - 什么任务
- I love you all. - What kind of mission?

2192
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,680
弄你的车
To wire your car

2193
02:31:06,890 --> 02:31:09,220
使你开车时
so it would explode

2194
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:11,930
便爆炸
when you turned the ignition.

2195
02:31:13,230 --> 02:31:17,230
牧师说你在散布穆罕默德的假消息
The ministers say you're spreading untruths about Mr. Muhammad.

2196
02:31:17,650 --> 02:31:20,520
他们说你是最大的骗子
They say that you're the greatest hypocrite

2197
02:31:20,730 --> 02:31:22,230
犹大
a Judas

2198
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:24,570
一个大骗子
a Benedict Arnold.

2199
02:31:25,990 --> 02:31:29,570
牧师说你的舌头该被割下来
The ministers say that your tongue should be cut out

2200
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:33,330
送到穆罕默德先生门前
and delivered to Mr. Muhammad's doorstep.

2201
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,790
你认为呢?
And what do you say?

2202
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,710
我支持你 牧师兄弟
I'm with you, Brother Minister.

2203
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:39,380
你会没命的 是的
You'll be marked for death.

2204
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,170
是的
Yes, sir.

2205
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:44,210
就让我死吧
Let me die then.

2206
02:31:56,770 --> 02:31:58,980
我不能介于你和你父亲之间
I can't come between you and your father.

2207
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:01,690
- 你是我父亲 - 回家
- You're my father. - Go on home.

2208
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:05,940
不要回来 这是命令
Don't come back. That's an order.

2209
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:15,160
是的
Yes, sir.

2210
02:32:27,630 --> 02:32:31,470
因为一九六四年被 预定为种族问题的爆发年
Because 1964 threatens to be an explosive year on the racial front

2211
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:36,310
我召开这记者会来澄清我立场
I have called this press conference to clarify my position in that struggle.

2212
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:40,560
伊斯兰国家的内乱迫了我出来
Internal differences within the Nation of Islam have forced me out of it.

2213
02:32:40,730 --> 02:32:44,770
在过去 我提倡穆罕默德的言论
In the past, I thought and spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

2214
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:46,900
我说了所有一切
Everything I said, I started with:

2215
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:50,410
由穆罕默德教导我们开始
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us" thus- and- so.

2216
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:52,280
那些日子己结束了
That day is over.

2217
02:32:52,490 --> 02:32:56,200
从现在起 我为自己说话 以自己的想法去思考
From now on I speak my own words, and I think my own thoughts.

2218
02:32:56,410 --> 02:32:59,120
现在我可以更自主和自由
Now that I have more, uh, independence of action

2219
02:32:59,330 --> 02:33:02,750
我会用更好的方法 和其他人
I'll use a more flexible approach in working with others

2220
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:04,590
合力解决这问题
to solve this problem.

2221
02:33:04,750 --> 02:33:07,090
我不和其他黑人领袖争吵
I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders.

2222
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:10,760
我忘了其他黑人领袖说过有关我的坏话
I've forgotten every bad thing other leaders said about me

2223
02:33:10,930 --> 02:33:14,760
我祈求他们也要忘记我所说有关他的坏话
and I pray they'll forget the many bad things I said about them.

2224
02:33:14,930 --> 02:33:19,020
我们一定要一同工作来找出问题的答案
We must work together to find a common solution to a common problem.

2225
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:22,440
我会在纽约组织新的伊斯兰教教堂
I will organize and lead a new mosque in New York City:

2226
02:33:22,650 --> 02:33:24,360
叫伊斯兰教徒的教堂
Muslim Mosque, Incorporated.

2227
02:33:24,770 --> 02:33:28,280
这会给我们宗教基础 及所需的精神力量
This gives us the religious base and the spiritual, uh, force

2228
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:31,110
来使我们的人脱离那些
necessary to rid our people of the vices

2229
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:33,700
毁坏我们社会道德的邪恶
that destroy the moral fiber of our community.

2230
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:36,280
我们的政治哲学会是黑种人国教
Our politics will be Black Nationalism

2231
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:39,540
意思是我们要控制社会的政治
meaning, we want to control our community's politics.

2232
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:42,170
伊斯兰教徒的教堂
The Muslim Mosque, Inc. Will remain open

2233
02:33:42,370 --> 02:33:45,630
会接受各区的意见和经济支助
for ideas and financial aid from all quarters.

2234
02:33:46,210 --> 02:33:49,130
白种人可帮助我们 但不能加入
Whites can help us, but they can't join us.

2235
02:33:49,380 --> 02:33:52,840
没有黑白联盟 直到有首个黑人联盟出现
There can't be black- white unity until there's first black unity.

2236
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:54,760
我们不能联合其他人
We can't unite with others

2237
02:33:54,970 --> 02:33:57,850
直到我们团结自己
until we've first learned to unite amongst ourselves.

2238
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:00,180
要让人们接受我们
We can't be acceptable to others

2239
02:34:00,390 --> 02:34:03,140
先要接受自己
until we have first proven acceptable to ourselves.

2240
02:34:03,310 --> 02:34:06,810
要完全明白伊斯兰教
In my desire to fully understand the religion of Islam

2241
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:11,150
像其他七亿五千万的伊斯兰教徒
as practiced by 750 million Muslims around the world

2242
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:15,740
我要朝圣 或神圣旅程 去麦加朝圣
I intend to make a pilgrimage, or holy, uh, journey, to Mecca.

2243
02:34:15,950 --> 02:34:18,700
这是每个伊斯兰教徒的责任
This pilgrimage is a religious requirement

2244
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:21,500
使得他们在一生中

最少朝圣一次

02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:52,290
在亚伯拉罕的古代家中
in the ancient home of Abraham, Mohammed

2281
02:37:52,830 --> 02:37:56,040
穆罕默德及圣经的伟大先知
and the great prophets of the Scriptures."

2282
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:04,890
今天在无数人面前
Today, with thousands of others

2283
02:38:05,050 --> 02:38:08,640
我在麦加宣告神的伟大
I proclaimed God's greatness in the sacred city of Mecca.

2284
02:38:09,730 --> 02:38:13,140
穿着朝圣服 我在卡巴附近绕七个圈
In the ihram garb, I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba.

2285
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:16,060
我喝沙井的水
I drank from the well of Zem Zem.

2286
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:19,230
我在亚法山上向真主祈祷
I prayed to Allah from Mount Arafat.

2287
02:38:19,570 --> 02:38:23,450
那是我生命中唯一一次 站在全能的创造者前
It was the only time in my life that I stood before the creator of all

2288
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:26,160
感到像个完全的人
and felt like a complete human being.

2289
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:48,930
你可能被这些言词吓到
Now, you may be shocked by these words

2290
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:52,980
但我吃同一碟食物 喝同一杯水
but I've eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass

2291
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:57,190
向同一个神祈祷 和那些蓝眼睛金发
and prayed to the same God with Muslims whose eyes were blue

2292
02:38:57,400 --> 02:39:01,650
白皮肤的伊斯兰教徒一起
whose hair was blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white.

2293
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:03,610
我们全是兄弟
And we were all brothers

2294
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:04,820
真的
truly.

2295
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:09,620
不同肤色及种族的人 全相信同一个神和人道
People of all colors and races believing in one God, in one humanity.

2296
02:39:24,300 --> 02:39:26,510
在这圣地的每一刻
Each hour in this sacred land gives me

2297
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:30,300
使我对美国有更深的见解
greater spiritual insight into what is happening in America.

2298
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:35,020
不能怪美国的黑种人
The American Negro can never be blamed for his racial animosities.

2299
02:39:35,230 --> 02:39:39,190
他只是对四百年的压迫反抗
He's only reacting to 400 years of oppression and discrimination.

2300
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:42,860
但因为种族主义会 引领美国步上自杀的道路
But as racism leads America up the suicidal path

2301
02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:46,700
我相信年轻一代 会看到墙上 人手所写的
I believe the younger generation will see the writing on the wall

2302
02:39:46,910 --> 02:39:50,320
会转回真理之道上
and many will want to turn to the spiritual path of truth

2303
02:39:50,490 --> 02:39:53,240
是唯一消除
the only way left to ward off the disaster

2304
02:39:53,450 --> 02:39:55,410
种族主义的方法
that racism must surely lead to.

2305
02:39:56,330 --> 02:40:00,500
之前在狱中 真理己进入了我心中
Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me.

2306
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:03,300
那再次发生了
Well, it has happened again.

2307
02:40:04,340 --> 02:40:07,840
过去 一竹竿打一船白种人
In the past, I've made sweeping indictments of all white people.

2308
02:40:08,090 --> 02:40:10,720
这样令一些无辜的
And these generalizations have caused injuries

2309
02:40:10,930 --> 02:40:13,430
白种人受伤
to some white folks who didn't deserve them.

2310
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:18,520
由于我朝圣后
"Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo

2311
02:40:18,730 --> 02:40:20,900
神圣的麦加城
as a result of my pilgrimage

2312
02:40:21,110 --> 02:40:23,190
得到新生
to the holy city of Mecca

2313
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:28,740
我不再一竹竿打一船人
I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race.

2314
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:30,450
我要小心
I intend

2315
02:40:31,370 --> 02:40:33,580
不指责
to be very careful not to.

2316
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:37,580
那些没有罪的人
careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty.

2317
02:40:38,210 --> 02:40:40,250
我不是个种族主义者
I am not a racist

2318
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:43,750
我不受种族主义的教条限制
and I do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism.

2319
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:45,880
诚实和真切地
In all honesty and sincerity

2320
02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:50,180
我只希望得到自由
it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice

2321
02:40:50,390 --> 02:40:52,050
公正及平等
and equality

2322
02:40:52,680 --> 02:40:57,390
生命 自由和人人快乐
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people.

2323
02:40:57,810 --> 02:41:01,060
我首要关注的是所属的团体
My first concern is with the group to which I belong

2324
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:05,400
我们比其他人失去更多权力
for we, more than others, are deprived of our inalienable rights.

2325
02:41:05,570 --> 02:41:07,570
但我相信伊斯兰真正的实行
But the true practice of Islam

2326
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:09,780
可从全美国人的灵魂及心中
can remove the cancer of racism

2327
02:41:09,990 --> 02:41:13,620
消灭种族主义这毒瘤
from the hearts and the souls of all Americans.

2328
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:16,120
若我的死可带来任何光明
If I can die having brought any light

2329
02:41:16,330 --> 02:41:21,250
能使有意义的真理 再度出现有助于毁这病的话
having exposed any truth that will help destroy this disease

2330
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,920
全靠有真主整个世界的主
then all the credit is due to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.

2331
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:28,840
那便是我唯一的错
And only the mistakes have been mine.

2332
02:41:30,430 --> 02:41:32,760
请把我所有的爱带给孩子
Please give all my love to the children.

2333
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:34,850
我真切的爱你
I love you dearly.

2334
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:39,020
真诚地
Sincerely, El- Hajj Malik El- Shabazz

2335
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:41,020
马尔克姆
Malcolm X.

2336
02:42:28,820 --> 02:42:29,900
我们开始吧
Let's begin.

2337
02:42:30,110 --> 02:42:34,490
你说你感到兄弟亲切关系
Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.

2338
02:42:34,660 --> 02:42:38,910
是 当我朝圣往麦加时
Uh, yes, when I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage

2339
02:42:39,830 --> 02:42:44,040
兄弟关存在于所有人 所有种族
the brotherhood that existed there among all people, all races

2340
02:42:44,250 --> 02:42:48,290
接受伊斯兰教的所有阶层的人
all levels of people who had accepted the religion of Islam

2341
02:42:49,250 --> 02:42:53,840
就算有着复杂的不同
what it had done for those people, despite

2342
02:42:54,050 --> 02:42:56,010
伊斯兰教也可有功效
their complexion differences.

2343
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:59,470
或许如果美国人可尝试
Perhaps if people here in America would try

2344
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:03,270
实行及学习伊斯兰教
and practice and study the religion of Islam, it might help

2345
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:07,310
可能有助消除种族主义的病毒
to erase the plague of racism here.

2346
02:43:07,770 --> 02:43:11,030
我认为伊斯兰教徒视自己为人类
I think Muslims over there look at themselves as

2347
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:16,160
是同一个人类家族中的一部份
human beings, as part of the same human family.

2348
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:19,030
今天我的朋友是黑的
Today my friends are black

2349
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:21,700
红的 黄的 啡的 白的
red, yellow, brown and white.

2350
02:43:21,910 --> 02:43:26,830
你会去联合国要求控告美国
Are you prepared to ask the UN to bring charges against the U.S

2351
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:28,670
因为美国黑种人的政策吗
for its treatment of Negroes?

2352
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:30,840
是的 会的
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

2353
02:43:32,710 --> 02:43:35,220
请大家安静一点
The audience will have to be quiet.

2354
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:37,720
请 请
Please, please.

2355
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:41,310
正如我之前所说
Yes, as I stated earlier that, um

2356
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:45,390
非洲 拉可和亚洲国家
those nations, African, Latin, Asian nations

2357
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:48,600
是伪善的当他们站在联合国面前
are hypocritical when they stand up in the UN

2358
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:52,230
他们指责南非的种族主义
and denounce the racism practiced in South Africa

2359
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:55,070
但同一时间却又不指责
but say absolutely nothing about

2360
02:43:55,320 --> 02:43:58,450
在美国社会中所实行的种族主义
the practice of racism here in American society.

2361
02:43:58,660 --> 02:44:01,330
如果我不这样做我便不是男人
Now, I wouldn't be a man if I didn't do so.

2362
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:06,460
你想和其他人权组织领袖工作?
Will you work now with leaders of other civil rights organizations?

2363
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:10,750
我己准备与任何团体 领袖合作
Yes, we're prepared to work with any groups, leaders, organizations

2364
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:14,420
只要他们有诚意
as long as they're genuinely interested in, uh, results.

2365
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:15,630
肯定有
Positive results.

2366
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:18,590
你的新胡子有宗教意思吗?
Does your new beard have any religious significance?

2367
02:44:20,050 --> 02:44:21,930
没有
Uh, no, not particularly, but

2368
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:25,770
但我认为黑种人挣扎
I think that, uh, as black people in America strive

2369
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:29,560
要抛开精神上殖民地主义的束缚
to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism

2370
02:44:29,770 --> 02:44:31,770
胡子反映出他们想抛开
they'll also reflect their desire

2371
02:44:31,980 --> 02:44:34,980
文化上殖民主义束缚的希望
to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism.

2372
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:38,990
我相信精神及文化的回流非洲
I believe that a mental and cultural migration back to Africa

2373
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:41,240
不需要身体上的回流
not necessarily a physical one

2374
02:44:41,450 --> 02:44:45,040
但精神及文化的回流
but a mental and cultural migration back to Africa

2375
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:49,370
那代表我们再次肯定 我们在那里的联系
which means we reaffirm our bond with our brothers over there

2376
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:53,840
会鼓励身处美国的我们
would help to strengthen, uh, us here, black people in America.

2377
02:44:54,050 --> 02:44:57,340
不只是精神上 也给我们动力
Not only spiritually, but it would give us the incentive

2378
02:44:57,550 --> 02:45:00,760
解决这里的问题
to solve some of our problems here, at, uh, at home.

2379
02:45:00,970 --> 02:45:03,550
你其中一个受争论的举动
One of your more controversial remarks

2380
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:06,890
是要求黑种人买枪 组织枪会
called for black people to get rifles and form clubs.

2381
02:45:07,100 --> 02:45:08,810
你仍支持那种自卫方法?
Do you still favor that for self- defense?

2382
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:10,980
我不明为何那值得争论
I don't see why that's controversial.

2383
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:14,110
如果白种人发觉他们自己
If white people find themselves the victims

2384
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:18,820
是暴力的受害者 而黑种人 也是同类暴力的受害者
of the violence black people found themselves victims of in America

2385
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:22,780
而政府又无能为力或坐视不理
and if the government was unable or unwilling to do anything

2386
02:45:22,990 --> 02:45:26,120
自卫是聪明的做法
it'd be intelligence on their part to defend themselves.

2387
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:27,830
枪呢?
What about the guns?

2388
02:45:29,710 --> 02:45:33,500
你叫白种人别再迫害黑种人
When you tell your people to stop being violent against my people

2389
02:45:33,710 --> 02:45:37,500
- 我会提倡放开枪械 - 你仍那么极端
- I'll tell my people to put away their guns. - So you're still an extremist.

2390
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:39,760
把你的手放出我的袋!
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2391
02:45:46,390 --> 02:45:47,430
下一个问题
Next question.

2392
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:11,500
马尔克姆 你这死黑鬼
Malcolm, you one dead, red nigger.

2393
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:16,000
你死期快到了
Your days on this earth are numbered, brother.

2394
02:46:28,390 --> 02:46:29,520
上床
Come to bed.

2395
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:31,890
休息一下
Get some rest.

2396
02:46:37,400 --> 02:46:38,900
对不起 贝蒂
I'm sorry, Betty.

2397
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:41,530
为了什么?
Sorry for what?

2398
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:45,410
我知道我不是最好的丈夫 也不是最好的父亲
I haven't been the best husband or the best father.

2399
02:46:45,570 --> 02:46:48,200
家庭是不该被分开的
A family shouldn't be separated like ours has been.

2400
02:46:48,410 --> 02:46:52,080
我答应你不会离开你或孩子远行
I promise I'll never make a long trip without you and the children.

2401
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:57,290
我怀念你和女孩子
I miss you and the girls.

2402
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:05,430
我答应你 我们会在一起
We will be together, I promise you that.

2403
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:07,800
亲爱的
Dear heart.

2404
02:47:10,140 --> 02:47:11,640
我爱你
I love you.

2405
02:47:16,350 --> 02:47:17,940
谢谢
Thank you.

2406
02:47:25,450 --> 02:47:27,280
睡觉吧
Now get some sleep.

2407
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:35,460
我们是黑种人组织中最好的
We had the best organization the black man has ever seen.

2408
02:47:36,830 --> 02:47:38,130
黑种人毁了它
Niggers ruined it.

2409
02:48:05,400 --> 02:48:06,650
醒醒!
Betty.

2410
02:48:09,370 --> 02:48:10,660
贝蒂
Betty, wake up.

2411
02:48:14,830 --> 02:48:16,210
贝蒂 快起来
Come on! Let's get up!

2412

快叫消防员
Somebody call the fire department!

2419
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:37,850

证据显示
Evidently, the, um

02:48:40,730 --> 02:48:44,400
一种炸弹被抛进屋子背后
some type of Molotov bomb was thrown against the back of the house.

2422
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:48,070
其中一个被抛在屋边旁
One was thrown on the side of the house, from what I can tell.

It bounced up against the window and woke my daughter.

2424
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:57,160

Had it gone inside, my 2- year- old, my 4- year- old

2425
02:48:57,370 --> 02:48:59,580
及六岁大的女儿会

若再发生 我会持枪

追着眼前的任何一个人

2428
02:49:04,210 --> 02:49:07,010
这是你生命中的一个警告吗
Was this a warning or an attempt on your life?

2429
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:09,590
那看来像是什么像个警告吗
What, does it look like a warning to you?

2430
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:11,550
伊斯兰教国家绝不会容许
This was a definite attempt

2431
02:49:11,890 --> 02:49:15,510
这样违反穆的教导
by the Nation of Islam, upon the strict orders of Mr. Elijah Muhammad.

2432
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:18,810
- 伊斯兰教总部会怎样说 - 无论他们说什么都不要紧
- Muslim headquarters say - I don't care what they say.

2433
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:20,390
我明白他们在做什么
I see what they're doing.

贝恩斯牧师 谁炸了那屋子
Minister Baines, can you tell us who bombed the house?

2435
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:28,400
大家都很关注马尔克姆
We feel it's a publicity stunt on the part of Malcolm X.

2436

我们不希望

02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:53,090
- 你知道我知道是谁做的 - 给我们那命令
- You know I know who did it. - Give us the command.

2445
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:56,100
别担心 己有两个在灯柱守 两个在屋旁
Don't worry about the command. Two men on post, two in front!

2446
02:49:56,260 --> 02:49:58,470
我从内部得到消息 不管你喜欢还是不喜欢听
We got an informant among us, whether you like it or not.

2447
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:01,770
我们必须在事情变糟糕前消除所谓的兄弟
Now, we gotta weed this so- called brother out before things get too crazy.

2448

我希望你听到
I wish you'd listen to us.

我不想搜任何人身
I don't want anybody frisked.

2463

我们要改变一下我们的想法

我们要令人们感到舒适

2465
02:51:42,250 --> 02:51:45,830
如果在我的地方也不安全 我在哪里可以安全
If I can't be safe around my own kind, who can I be safe around?

2466
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:47,870
我相信真主会保护我
I trust Allah will protect me.

2467
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:52,300
相信真主是一件事 但我也相信武装
Believing in Allah is one thing, but I also believe in being armed.

2468
02:51:55,550 --> 02:51:59,220

We don't want black people killing each other, all right?

02:59:24,830 --> 02:59:26,290
你没事吗
Are you all right?

2545
02:59:26,500 --> 02:59:27,540
你没事吗
Are you okay?

2546
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:33,300
- 没有事 - 我认得你
- Yeah. - Good. I recognize you.

2547
02:59:33,510 --> 02:59:36,010
别理那些人
Don't you pay them folks no never mind.

2548
02:59:36,220 --> 02:59:38,850
你只是做你所做的事
You just keep right on doing what you doing.

2549
02:59:40,930 --> 02:59:42,100
是 太太
Yes, ma'am.

2550
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:45,020
- 我会为你祈祷 儿子 - 谢谢
- I'll pray for you, son. - Well, thank you.

2551
02:59:45,390 --> 02:59:47,270
主会保护你
Jesus will protect you.

2552
03:00:01,700 --> 03:00:03,200
约章准备好了吗
Is the charter ready?

2553
03:00:03,370 --> 03:00:05,500
- 没有 - 牧师兄弟
- no, Brother Minister. - No?

2554
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:08,540
没有 为什么?
No? Why not?

2555
03:00:10,920 --> 03:00:12,840
你有足够时间 不是吗
You had enough time, didn't you?

2556
03:00:13,050 --> 03:00:15,340
我道歉 我们会在下星期有
I apologize. We'll have it next week.

2557
03:00:15,550 --> 03:00:17,840
不是下星期要 是今天要
We don't have next week. We need it today.

2558
03:00:18,050 --> 03:00:20,390
他们等着今天听
The people want to hear the charter today.

2559
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:22,260
下星期 牧师
Next week, Minister.

2560
03:00:28,730 --> 03:00:30,100
神父到了吗
Is the reverend here?

2561
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:33,730
神父说他不能来
The reverend called and said he wouldn't be able to attend.

2562
03:00:35,240 --> 03:00:38,740
所以我们没有开场讲者 没有约章
So now we don't have an opening speaker or a charter.

2563
03:00:39,530 --> 03:00:42,370
我的意思是 为何昨晚不告诉我
Why didn't you say this last night when I talked to you?

2564
03:00:42,580 --> 03:00:45,410
- 我找过贝蒂姐妹 - 你不必叫她
- I called Sister Betty - You didn't have to call her.

2565
03:00:45,620 --> 03:00:47,580
你该告诉我 找她干什么
You should've told me. Why tell her?

2566
03:00:47,790 --> 03:00:50,080
- 我以为 - 别以为
- I assumed that - Don't assume anything!

2567
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:01,760
下去
Go on down front.

2568
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:04,640
- 姐妹 你也是 - 是
- Sister, you go on with the brother. - Yes, sir.

2569
03:01:19,410 --> 03:01:20,660
马尔克姆
Malcolm.

2570
03:01:23,280 --> 03:01:24,490
有什么不妥
What's wrong?

2571
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,330
现在是时间做瑞德士了
It's a time for martyrs now.

2572
03:01:35,050 --> 03:01:36,920
我感到
The way I feel

2573
03:01:38,340 --> 03:01:40,430
不该今天出去那里
I shouldn't go out there today.

2574
03:01:42,010 --> 03:01:44,510
好 我们取消它
Fine. Let's cancel it.

2575
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:49,680
我妻子和我的孩子在外面吗?
My wife out there? My children?

2576
03:01:50,100 --> 03:01:52,100
正如往常般下去
Down front, as always.

2577
03:01:55,110 --> 03:01:57,780
你出去外面的电话亭
Go out to the pay phone outside.

2578
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:03,570
找神父看他可否去那里
Call up the reverend, see if he can make it down here.

2579
03:02:03,780 --> 03:02:07,950
我要去看守 我该在那里保护你
I gotta be on post, Malcolm. I'm supposed to be out there guarding you.

2580
03:02:08,160 --> 03:02:13,080
- 况且 那是秘书的工作 - 去打电话
- Besides, that's a duty for secretaries - Go out to the pay phone.

2581
03:02:13,630 --> 03:02:15,210
给神父问
Call up the reverend.

2582
03:02:15,710 --> 03:02:17,550
他可否下去
See if he can make it down here.

2583
03:02:22,010 --> 03:02:23,220
好
Fine.

2584
03:03:12,180 --> 03:03:15,440
请大家做好 节目开始
Please, let's settle down. Let's get the program started.

2585
03:03:18,570 --> 03:03:19,860
谢谢
Thank you.

2586
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:27,490
我为刚才的事道歉
I apologize for raising my voice earlier.

2587
03:03:27,700 --> 03:03:29,280
十分不敬
It was very disrespectful.

2588
03:03:29,540 --> 03:03:32,040
牧师兄弟 我明白的
Brother Minister, I understand.

2589
03:03:41,050 --> 03:03:42,340
生活方式在变
Why, styles are changing

2590
03:03:42,510 --> 03:03:45,430
思想在变 所以一切都在变
minds are changing, why, everything is changing.

2591
03:03:46,090 --> 03:03:50,140
你和我要留意我们转变得很快的生活
So you and I must consider that we're living in very changing times.

2592
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:54,020
今天真的事 明天或许便不是真的了
And what might be true today may not be true tomorrow.

2593
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:57,600
没有进一步的烦扰 不用多作介绍
And without any further ado, I present to you

2594
03:03:58,060 --> 03:04:00,770
马尔克姆牧师兄弟 我会祈祷
Brother Minister Malcolm. And I pray

2595
03:04:01,230 --> 03:04:04,940
你和我会留心听
that you and I will listen. Listen

2596
03:04:05,570 --> 03:04:09,120
留心听便会明白 谢谢
hear and understand. Thank you.

2597
03:04:16,120 --> 03:04:17,460
爸爸!
Daddy!

2598
03:04:31,810 --> 03:04:33,970
放开你的手!
Get your hand out of my pocket!

2599
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:36,810
兄弟
Brother.

2600
03:04:36,980 --> 03:04:38,100
兄弟 请等等
Please. Hold it.

2601
03:04:39,770 --> 03:04:41,810
冷静下来 天!
Calm down. Please, brothers!

2602
03:04:43,480 --> 03:04:44,780
天啊 马尔克姆!
Malcolm!

2603
03:04:46,400 --> 03:04:47,650
马尔克姆!
Malcolm!

2604
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:21,850
马尔克姆!
Malcolm!

2605
03:05:24,650 --> 03:05:26,730
叫救护车!
Get an ambulance!

2606
03:05:26,940 --> 03:05:29,360
- 叫救护车! - 是他们杀死他!
- Somebody get an ambulance! - They killed him!

2607
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:33,160
是他们杀死他!
They killed him!

2608
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:45,130
我要杀了你! 我要杀了你!
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

2609
03:05:48,050 --> 03:05:49,590
抓住他
Get him!

2610
03:05:51,010 --> 03:05:53,220
他杀了他!
He killed Malcolm!

2611
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:05,860
退开!
Back off, people!

2612
03:06:40,140 --> 03:06:42,770
我们这里有人身中多抢
We've got multiple shooting victims.

2613
03:06:52,150 --> 03:06:53,450
别挡着路
Get out of the way!

2614
03:06:58,700 --> 03:06:59,740
走开
Move!

2615
03:07:08,090 --> 03:07:11,050
退后 离开这里 走开
Stand back! Get out of the way! Get back!

2616
03:07:12,930 --> 03:07:15,380
请给我一个陈词!
Give us a statement, sir! Please!

2617
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:19,010
你所认识的马尔克姆埃克斯不在了
The person you know as Malcolm X is no more.

2618
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:21,350
马尔克姆埃克斯被杀
The assassination

2619
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:25,190
是件不幸的悲剧
of Malcolm X was an unfortunate tragedy.

2620
03:07:25,600 --> 03:07:28,270
那反映我们的国家中
And it reveals that there are still

2621
03:07:28,610 --> 03:07:31,690
仍有很多人
uh, numerous people in our nation who have

2622
03:07:31,940 --> 03:07:36,610
以为可通过谋杀来表达不满
degenerated to the point of expressing dissent through murder

2623
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:41,410
我们没有学到 怎样和平表达不满
and we haven't learned to disagree without being violently disagreeable.

2624
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:43,790
在这里
Here

2625
03:07:44,540 --> 03:07:47,210
在这最后的时刻
at this final hour

2626
03:07:47,790 --> 03:07:50,040
在这清静的地方
in this quiet place

2627
03:07:50,750 --> 03:07:53,050
哈林要告别
Harlem has come to bid farewell

2628
03:07:53,260 --> 03:07:55,680
最光亮的希望
to one of its brightest hopes

2629
03:07:56,680 --> 03:07:58,680
现在光辉地
extinguished now

2630
03:07:59,140 --> 03:08:01,810
永远离开我们
and gone from us forever.

2631
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:05,730
在我们记忆深处
It is not in the memory of man that this

2632
03:08:05,940 --> 03:08:07,520
再没有其他人
beleaguered, unfortunate

2633
03:08:07,690 --> 03:08:09,860
比这位勇敢的青年人
but nonetheless proud community

2634
03:08:10,230 --> 03:08:14,650
更勇敢更冒险了
has found a braver, more gallant young champion

2635
03:08:14,900 --> 03:08:18,360
一个仍未被征服的
than this Afro- American who lies before us

2636
03:08:19,320 --> 03:08:21,330
非洲美国人
unconquered still.

2637
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:25,580
我再说一次因为他想我
I say the word again as he would want me to:

2638
03:08:25,790 --> 03:08:27,160
非洲美国人
Afro- American.

2639
03:08:27,370 --> 03:08:30,710
非洲美国人马尔克姆
Afro- American Malcolm.

2640
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:33,630
马尔克姆一早己不是黑奴
Malcolm had stopped being "Negro"

2641
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:35,170
早已不是了
years ago.

2642
03:08:35,380 --> 03:08:40,340
那实在太弱少了 对他来说太弱了
It had become too small, too puny, too weak a word for him.

2643
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:42,890
马尔克姆比那更大
Malcolm was bigger than that.

2644
03:08:43,180 --> 03:08:44,470
马尔克姆己变成
Malcolm had become

2645
03:08:44,730 --> 03:08:46,930
非洲美国人了
an Afro- American.

2646
03:08:47,230 --> 03:08:49,440
他绝望地想要使
And he wanted so desperately

2647
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:52,570
我们所有人
that we, that all his people

2648
03:08:52,770 --> 03:08:55,900
也成为非洲美国人
would become Afro- Americans too.

2649
03:08:59,910 --> 03:09:03,370
仍有人认为要
There are those who still consider it their duty

2650
03:09:03,580 --> 03:09:07,250
作为黑种人朋友一样
as friends of the Negro people, to tell us

2651
03:09:07,790 --> 03:09:09,540
告诉我们来咒骂他
to revile him.

2652
03:09:09,750 --> 03:09:13,040
令他们不存在我们的记忆里
To flee, even from the presence of his memory.

2653
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:14,750
藉着把他们
To save ourselves

2654
03:09:14,960 --> 03:09:19,550
摒弃于历史外救自己
by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times.

2655
03:09:19,930 --> 03:09:21,970
我们会微笑
And we will smile.

2656
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:24,600
他们会说他是憎恨的狂热者
They will say that he is of hate, a fanatic

2657
03:09:24,810 --> 03:09:27,810
一个只为你们的争斗
a racist, who can only bring evil to the cause

2658
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:29,440
带来邪恶的种族主义者
for which you struggle.

2659
03:09:29,640 --> 03:09:32,610
我们会向他们说
And we will answer and say unto them:

2660
03:09:32,810 --> 03:09:34,770
你和马尔克姆兄弟
"Did you ever talk

2661
03:09:35,150 --> 03:09:36,820
谈论过吗
to Brother Malcolm?

2662
03:09:37,440 --> 03:09:39,280
有接触过他
Did you ever touch him

2663
03:09:39,490 --> 03:09:41,610
或他有向你微笑吗
or have him smile at you?

2664
03:09:41,820 --> 03:09:44,240
你真的听过他的话吗
Did you ever really listen to him?"

2665
03:09:44,410 --> 03:09:46,290
你有做过正确的事情吗?
You haven't done the right thing.

2666
03:09:46,450 --> 03:09:50,620
他真的就是暴力或公众扰乱吗
"Was he ever associated with violence or any public disturbance?

2667
03:09:50,830 --> 03:09:53,750
如果你有 你便认识他
For if you did, you would know him.

2668
03:09:53,960 --> 03:09:55,460
如果你认识他
And if you knew him

2669
03:09:55,670 --> 03:09:59,420
你便知道我们为何要敬重他
you would know why we must honor him."

2670
03:09:59,630 --> 03:10:03,970
马尔克姆是我们黑种人生活的典范
Malcolm was our manhood. Our living, black manhood.

2671
03:10:04,180 --> 03:10:06,260
这是他对他人民的意思
This was his meaning to his people.

2672
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:11,140
在敬重他时 我们敬重 我们当中最好的人
And in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.

2673
03:10:12,480 --> 03:10:15,150
无论我们和他怎样不同
However much we may have differed with him

2674
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:18,440
或不同于他的价值观
or with each other about him and his value as a man

2675
03:10:18,650 --> 03:10:20,780
他离开我们
let his going from us serve

2676
03:10:20,990 --> 03:10:24,030
只会令我们现在更团结
only to bring us together now

2677
03:10:25,030 --> 03:10:27,700
把这些道德留在地上
consigning these mortal remains to earth

2678
03:10:28,200 --> 03:10:30,290
万物之母
the common mother of all

2679
03:10:30,500 --> 03:10:33,830
知道我们埋葬的
secure in the knowledge that what we place in the ground

2680
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:35,330
不只是一个人
is no more now a man

2681
03:10:35,630 --> 03:10:37,170
而且是一棵种子
but a seed

2682
03:10:37,500 --> 03:10:40,460
在我们不满的冬天过后

2689

And so today, May 19th, we celebrate Malcolm X's birthday

2692
03:11:08,240 --> 03:11:12,080
因为他是个伟大的非洲美国人

2693
03:11:12,370 --> 03:11:15,040

2702
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:33,430
因为马尔克姆兄弟说过
As Brother Malcolm said:

2703
03:11:36,270 --> 03:11:38,230

不择手段
