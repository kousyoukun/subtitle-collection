..and toId them my father
was in MiIwaukee, preaching.

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,875
Now, these hooded KIansmen
said the good white Christians...

149
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,077
..wouId not stand forhis troubIemaking,
and to get out of town.

150
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,355
- C'mon!
- Bring him out!

151
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,270
- (screaming)
- Come on!

152
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,796
- lt's all right!
- (children shriek)

153
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,838
- You and your family, Earl!
- We got no place for y'all here!

154
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,195
(shouting and screaming)

155
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,271
Mommy!

156
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,674
They broke every window
before riding offinto the night.

157
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,439
They rode offinto the moonIight
as suddenIy as they had come.

158
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,716
You see, my father
was not a frightened Negro,...

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,836
..as most were then,
and as many stiII are today.

160
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,357
He was six feet four, a very strong man,
and beIieved, as did Marcus Garvey,...

161
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,829
..that freedom, independence
and seIf-respect...

162
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,990
..couId neverbe achieved
by the Negro in America.

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,279
..on the object of building up
for themselves a great nation in Africa.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,316
Therefore,
bIack men shouId Ieave America...

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,356
..and return to the Iand oftheir origins.

166
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,635
..to his original home, Africa!

167
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,676
My father dedicated his Iife to his beIiefs...

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,991
..because he had seen
four ofhis six brothers die vioIentIy.

169
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,840
Three kiIIed by white men,
and one Iynched.

170
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,876
There were nine chiIdren
in our famiIy.

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,397
My mother was a proud woman,
an educated woman, and a strong woman.

172
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,429
She was very fair-skinned because
hermother was raped by a white man.

173
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,308
One ofthe reasons she married my father
was because he was so bIack.

174
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,598
She hated the white bIood in herbody
and wanted her chiIdren to have coIour.

175
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,434
In fact, I think this had
a profound effect on me back then,...

176
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
..and on most Negroes today.

177
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,911
So many ofoursisters have been raped
or vioIated by the white man,...

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,073
..that the bIack men can't wait to get
theirhands on the white man's prize:

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,593
..the white woman.

180
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,716

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,317
- Oh! Aaaagh!
- Boom!

304
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,879
- You dirty, stinkin'...
- One more! One more! Boom!

305
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,077
- Aw, Jesus!
- (laughs and groans)

306
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,912
- (gunshot)
- Filthy, rotten, stinkin' copper! Aah...

307
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,911
He used to be a big shot.

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,231
(screams)

309
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,750
There is just nothing l can do.

310
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,071
- What do you mean, took his own life?
- l'm sorry, ma'am. You heard the verdict.

311
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,029
Verdict? A man takes a hammer
and bashes in the back of his own head,...

312
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,315
..then he lays down on the tracks
and kills himself(?)

313
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,039
We merely act on the verdicts,
we don't make them.

314
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,076
Well, do you pay or don't you?

315
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,310
Read the policy, ma'am.

316
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,469
lt clearly states...

317
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,596
C'mere, Sophia.

318
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,434

323
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,598

324
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,512

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,475

* Can't we saiI away
On the IittIe dreams

331
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,913
* And settIe high on the crest ofa thriII?

332
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,716
Yeah.

333
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,354
(snorts) That's your story, girl.
So, when you gonna holler rape, sister?

334
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,555
Me?

335
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,269
Yes, you. You would if the time came.
Sure you would.

336
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,030
Malcolm, let me feed you.

337
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,556
C'mon.

338
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,876
While they're hot.

339
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,989
l sure wish your mother and father
could see you now.

340
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,150
And that ofay you gonna marry.

341
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,992
l sure wish Laura could see us.

342
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,478
* Let's buiId a stairway to the stars... *

343
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,590
Please, Malcolm.

344
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,155
There's nobody around.

345
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,510
Nah, this ain't right.

346
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,670
- Why?
- Because you...

347
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,239
No, it's...

348
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,788
- lt's because of the white girl, isn't it?
- No, it's not because of that.

349
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,235
- Folks say you two are running around.
- lt's not because of that.

350
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,600
Save it, all right, Laura?
Save it for Mr Right,...

351
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,559
..because your grandmother's
smarter than you think.

352
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,959
l'm sorry she raised me that way.

353
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,315
ls your mother alive?

354
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,469
Yeah, she's alive.

355
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,073
When l was a kid, l was so poor l used
to think ''Not For Sale'' was a brand name.

356
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,152
- l did knock.
- Did you hear me say come in?

357
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,358
There's no point in fighting about it.
l'm sorry.

358
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,477
- May l sit down?
- As you nice enough to ask(!)

359
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,188
lt's the same questions, Mrs Little.

360
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,271
Since the death of your husband,...

361
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,998
- Murder. Murder.
- There is serious question...

362
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,437
..as to whether or not you are capable
of raising these children on your own.

363
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,635
Oh, well...

364
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
These are my children.

365
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,436
They're mine.

366
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,556
And there ain't no question.

367
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,997
Sometimes, l think, Mrs Little,
candour is the only kindness.

368
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,755
All of your children are delinquent,...

369
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,957
..and one, at least - Malcolm - is a thief.

370
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,678
Get outta here!

371
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,354
Your control over your children
is therefore nonexistent...

372
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,953
Did you hear me?

373
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,796
You will regret this.

374
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,237
lf you don't move out through that door,
you're gonna be past regretting!

375
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,479
We were parceIIed out, aII ofus.

376
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,073
I beIieve that ifever a state agency
destroyed a famiIy, it destroyed ours.

377
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,470
I was sent to a detention home,
and Iived at this woman's house.

378
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,312
This is your room, Malcolm,
l know you'll keep it clean.

379
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,992
Mrs SwerIin.

380
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,195
Boys, this is Malcolm, our new guest.
We'll treat him like a brother.

381
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,239
I was speciaI.
The onIy coIoured kid in the cIass.

382
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,997
I became sort ofa mascot, Iike a...
Iike a pink poodIe.

383
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,435
In fact, I got caIIed a niggerso much,...

384
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,318
..I didn 't think there was anything wrong
with it. I thought it was my name.

385
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,799
(Mrs SwerIin) He's a fine athIete...

386
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,950
They taIked about me Iike I wasn't there,...

387
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,110
..Iike I was a pedigree dog or a horse.

388
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,589
- ..president ofhis cIass.
- Like I was invisibIe.

389
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,231
Now, the important thing is to be realistic.

390
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,109
We all like you here. You know that.

391
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,470
But you're a nigger, and a lawyer
is no realistic goal for a nigger.

392
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,275
But why, Mr Ostrowski?

393
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,920
l gets the best grades in class.

394
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,196
l got voted class president.
l wanna be a lawyer.

395
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,670
No. l want you to think about
something that you can be.

396
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,151
You're good with your hands.
Making things.

397
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,470
People would give you work. l would.

398
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,234
Why don't you become a carpenter?

399
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,198
That's a good profession for a coloured.

400
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,115
Wasn't your pa a carpenter?

401
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,156
Jesus was a carpenter.

402
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,039
People like you as a person.
You're doing real well.

403
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,397
Remember what we said? ''Nothing
succeeds like success.'' Let me hear it.

404
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,918
- Nothing succeeds like success.
- Right. As long as you're realistic.

405
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,752
lt's not the end of the world, Malcolm.

406
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,390
l said ''Don't...

407
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,309
..let 'em give that boy no pig.''

408
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,791
It wasn't the end forme, but it was
the beginning ofthe end formy mother.

409
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,878
(train whistle)

410
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,838
- (radio) A right cross to thejaw by Louis!
- (all cheer)

411
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,592
Conn is covering up now!

412
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,148
Louis takes Conn's head back
with a right uppercut!

413
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,676
He's reeIing around the ring!
Louis hits a Ieft and a right to thejaw!

414
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,795
And Conn is down,...

415
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,310

420
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,349
- No, the referee says it's aII over!
- (all cheer)

421
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,396
- The referee says it's aII over!
- l knew he was gonna get it!

422
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,950
- What in hell is going on?
- Uh, nothing, Mr Cooper.

423
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,553
We got a lot of hungry customers!

424
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,676
- Uh, yes, sir!
- Soup done finished, Mr Cooper!

425
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,196
- That's right, Mr Charlie!
- The name is Mr Cooper.

426
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,316
And don't you forget it! Mr Cooper.

427
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,835
Boy, what in the hell is the matter
with you? You want me to get fired?

428
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,799
- l got a wife and six kids!
- Mr Cooper is good white folk, boy!

429
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,189
You is a young fool!

430
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,476

433

They're ceIebrating! They're going crazy!

452

You didn't have eight, two, one!

Were you high, old man? l threw the slats

The first thing he's gonna do is

694
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,477
His rep is on the line. So is yours.

And Red, if you're lyin',
you're a dead man.

shot all them crackers dead.

760
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,669
l just wanted to scare 'em. They won't be
around here botherin' us no more.

761
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,679
They won't be here no time soon.

762
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,079
l'm a man!

763
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,832
(rumbling)

764
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,273
That'll teach you, nigger!

765
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,430
(cries out)

766
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,192
- (shrieks) Oh, God!
- Get a doctor!

767
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,078
He doesn't need a doctor,
he needs a preacher.

768
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,875
Red, l'm glad we got you outta there.

769
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,997
With West lndian Archie on your ass,
your name on the wire,...

770
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,196
..Boston's the best place for you.

771
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,477
Yeah. Well, we'll take it easy, huh, baby?

772
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,840
Shorty, l got a place fixed up for us
on Harvard Square. How's that sound?

773
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,434
- Sounds good. We'll lay low for a while.
- Yeah.

774
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,956
Don't you worry about a thing.
l'll stake you, baby.

775
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,508
l got my band, l'm blowin' great sax.

776
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,750
Hell, Red, you ain't even heard us play yet!

777
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,796
Like every hustIer, I was trapped.

778
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,032
Cats that hung together to find a IittIe
security, find an answer, found nothing.

779
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,793
Cats that might have probed space,
or cured cancer...

780
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,633
I mean, West Indian Archie
might have been a mathematicaI genius.

781
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,234
We were aII victims
ofthe American sociaI order.

782
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,313
UntiI that time, there were three things
that I was aIways afraid of:

783
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,233
..ajob, a bust, andjaiI.

784
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,711
But I reaIised then that I wasn't afraid
ofanything. I was an animaI.

785
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,989
He don't look too good.

786
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,154
All right, we gonna rob this town blind.
Anybody want out, say so now.

787
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,472
Good. Good. OK, l set up a stake and
l got somebody to move the goods for us.

788
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,154
All we need now is a driver.
Any suggestions?

789
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,912
- How 'bout Rudy?
- Yeah, Rudy.

790
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,877
Who's Rudy?

791
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,280
l'm half-wop, l'm half-nigger,
l'm not afraid of nobody.

792
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:13,070
- That right? So what do you do?
- Name it, fella, l claim it.

793
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,720
Rudy does catering.
Rich joints on Beacon Hill.

794
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,030
- ls that right?
- Tell him about Baldy.

795
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,759
- Baldy? (laughs)
- Yeah. Yeah.

796
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,958
Yeah, he's this old rich ofay motherfucker.
l give him a bath every Friday night.

797
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,720
Towel him off, talcum powder on him,

798
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,280
- (laughter)

799
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,509
Yeah? And? So, what about him?

800
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,513
Guy's got jewellery,
he's got a coin collection, he's got china,...

801
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,909
- ..he's got rugs...
- Ah. That might be all right.

802
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,754
Shit, l know this town, man.
l got my own fences!

803
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,631
(chuckles) Who is this guy? Huh?
Who put you in charge?

804
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,633
- You wanna be in charge, Rudy?
- l am in charge!

805
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,917
- You the head nigger in charge, huh?
- Yeah! l'm the head nigger in charge.

806

Cos l'm a fair man.

808

And l like big-head niggers like you.

809
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,200
We'll flip for it.

810
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,713
We'll flip this.

811
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,035
(bullets clatter on table)

812
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,669
C'mon, Red...

813
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,516
She loves me.

814
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,670
She loves me not.

815
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,236
She loves me.

816
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,755
She loves me not.

817
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,556

Red, stop clowning around, all right?
For Chrissakes!

824
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,319
- lt's your turn, Rudy.
- Quit fooling around. Come on, guys.

825
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,236
You don't wanna flip?
Let me show you how. l'll do it again.

826
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,073
- Christ, Red, don't!

827
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,276
- Red...
- Red, stop it!

828
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,272
Maybe you miss somethin'? You got
your eyes open? Look at me, Rudy.

829
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,397
- You don't have to do this, Red.

Nah, you don't, do you? l'll help you.

- Here.
- Red, don't!

834
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,828
Maybe we shoot

835

Or is that the nigger side?

00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,233
Hey! Watch it! No funny business, now!

908
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,348
Red, the jig is up.

909
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,113
The average first offender
gets two years forburgIary.

910
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,915
We were aII first offenders,
so that's what Sophia and Peg drew.

911
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,912
Two years in the women's reformatory
at Framingham.

912
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,399
But our crime wasn't burgIary.

913
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,075
It was sIeeping with white girIs.
They threw the book at us.

914
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,072
Burglary, count one: eight to ten years.

915
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,595

920
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,916
Count eight: eight to ten years.

00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,195

Count thirteen: eight to ten years,
and count fourteen...

926
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,752
- Fourteen counts ofeight to ten years.
- All the sentences to run concurrently.

927
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,274
(chuckIes) Shorty thought he had hit us
with over 100 years,...

928
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,316
..untiI I expIained
what ''concurrentIy'' meant.

929
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,233
It meant a minimum sentence
often years'hard Iabour...

930
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,834
..at the CharIestown State Prison.

931
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,676

954
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,470

955
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,716
- Now state your number, Little.

957
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,792
Can't you read it right there, boy?
There! Can't you read, boy?

958
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,995

963
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,269
(whispers)
They ain't gonna break me down.

964
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,076
Well, that's just the kind of nigger l am.
They' ain't gonna break me down.

965
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,914
Now l'm situatin'...

(water drips)

970
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,636
Suit yourself. Ten more days.

971
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,956
(footsteps)

972
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,276
Water!

975
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,434
(footsteps, knock at door)

976
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,830
You want a smoke?

977
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,916
You know what a friend
you have in Jesus, son.

978
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,880
(laughs) A friend?

979
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,757
(voice cracks) Uh?

980
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,549
He's a friend, huh, Chappy? Well,
if he's such a friend, where is he, huh?

981
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,200
What he done for me?
A friend we have in Je...

982
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,353
Yeah, l tell you what you do, Chap.
You tell him to call me!

983
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,715
Call me and tell me
what kind of friend he is, huh?

984
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,916
Solitary Two, 2607!

985
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,275
(roars)
What he done for me, Chappy, huh?

986
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,955
Where is he every time l need him, huh?
You tell me that!

987
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,475
Where is this Jesus?
l'll tell you where he is!

988
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,711
He's out with the police, Chaplain!
Yeah, l'll straighten him out!

989
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,469
What has he done for me?
He ain't done nothin' for me!

990
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,234
Ain't done nothin' for me. (exhales)

991
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,154
(mutters) ''What a friend we have
in Jesus(!)'' Jesus can kiss my ass!

992
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,357
Tell Jesus to kiss my ass!
How 'bout that? Tell him that!

993
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,155
(hoarse sob)

994
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,198
(cries softly)

995
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,716
(sobs)

996
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,196
(growls)

997
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,029
(whimpers and growls)

998
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,716
(hoarse) Haah! Haaah! Aaah!

999
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,632
Aaaaah!

1000
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,870
Aaaaaaah!

1001
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:59,115
(howls)

1002
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,798
Little!

1003
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,711
Little!

1004
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,756
State your number, Little!

1005
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,196
C'mon, state it!

1006
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,872

1007
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,156
A228.

1008
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,750
Come on! (grunts)

1009
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,636
(door slams)

1010
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,069
l know how you feel.
Like you wanna lay down and die.

1011
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,676
l brought you something.

1012
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,672
(hoarse) Yeah, well,
l don't need any more favours from you.

1013
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,069
lt's nutmeg. Put it in the water.

1014
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,516
You need something
to get the monkey off your back.

1015
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,194
lt's not cocaine, but it'll help some.

1016
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,920
Drink it slow. This stuff is strong.

1017
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,476
(coughs)

1018
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,318
(coughs) So what's your hype, huh?

1019
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,154
l can show you how to get out of prison.
And it's no hype.

1020
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,198
Yeah, well, talk, daddy-o. l'm listenin'.

1021
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,235
- Hey, this ain't bad. You got some more?
- That's the last fix l'm givin' you.

1022
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,630
- So what you give it to me for, then, huh?
- Because you needed it.

1023
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,473
Because you couldn't hear me without it.

1024
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,680
(snorts) Nigger, get on outta my face.

1025
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,116
l think you got more sense
than any cat in this prison.

1026
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,191
But why the hell don't you use it?

1027
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,390
You can't bust out of here,...

1028
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,675
..like they do in the movies.

1029
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,275
- Even if you get out, you're still in prison.
- Well, you ain't lyin' there.

1030
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,114
You go bustin' your fist against
a stone wall, you're not usin' your brain!

1031
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,316
That's what the white man
wants you to do!

1032
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,916
Look at you!
Puttin' all that poison in your hair.

1033
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,195
l think you've been in prison too long,
my man,...

1034
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,236
..because everybody
on the outside conks.

1035
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,595
Why? Why does everybody
on the outside conk?

1036
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,989
Cos they don't want a nappy head,
like...

1037
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,878
Like what? Like me? Like a nigger?

1038
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,635
Why don't you wanna look like
what you are?

1039
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,439
What makes you ashamed
of bein' black?

1040
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,718
Lemme tell you somethin',
l'm not ashamed of bein' anything.

1041
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,668
You better get your hands off me.
l got to wash this out.

1042
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,872
- Let it burn!
- Nigger, get your hands off of me!

1043
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,791
Go on. Burn yourself. Pain yourself!

1044
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,678
Puttin' that poison in your hair,
in your body, tryin' to be white!

1045
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,589
(laughs) l don't wanna hear all this shit.

1046
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,796
l thought you was smart.

1047
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,270
But you just another of those cats struttin'
down the avenue in your clown suit...

1048
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,794
...with all that mess on you,
lookin' like a monkey!

1049
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,793
The white man sees you and laughs,
because he knows you ain't white!

1050
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,839
- Man, who are you?
- No. The question is, who are you?

1051
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,234
Well, l'll tell you.
You are lost in the darkness.

1052
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,154
But Elijah Muhammad has come
to bring you into the light.

1053
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,039
- Who?
- Elijah Muhammad...

1054
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,554
..can get you out of prison.

1055
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,994
Out of the prison of your mind.

1056
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,193
But maybe all you want is another fix.

1057
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,638
(prisoners talk quietly)

1058
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,674
And then you get used to this life,
and it puts you to sleep.

1059
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,070
- That's right.
- You stop thinking, acting for yourself.

1060
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,040
You couldn't scrounge
three squares a day on the outside.

1061
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,112
So you let them feed you.
Give you dominoes to play with.

1062
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,835
- Let you shoot marbles, play baseball.
- Let's go! Cut the sermon!

1063
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,549
He blows his whistle, and you sit!
You stand, you grab, gobble...

1064
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,471
File out! Sleep!

1065
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,190
- Sing out your number, loud as you can!
- l told you to knock it off, Baines.

1066
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,714
Now, are you gonna take yard?

1067
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,396
l'm stayin'.

1068
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,913
Uh, yeah, me, too.

1069
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:22,395
What're you sniffin' around for?
l told you l gave you your last fix.

1070
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,314
What's your angle, nigger? Hm?

1071
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,752
Nigger? Who's wearing the conk(?)

1072
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,992
You the only cat in this prison l done seen
that act the way you do.

1073
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,197
You ain't even afraid of talking like that
in front of them guards or nothin'.

1074
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,273
- What more can he do to me?
- Hm.

1075
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,440
l mean, you don't cuss none.

1076
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,829
You don't talk that
''Whatcha know, daddy'' jive.

1077
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,992
A man curses because he doesn't have
the words to say what's on his mind.

1078
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,113
(chuckles)

1079
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,756
Yeah.

1080
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,593
Yeah, l know you got an angle,
some kinda way.

1081
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,636
Don't con me.

1082
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,995
Don't con me, and don't try.

1083
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,918
Hey.

1084
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,673
Just offerin' you a cigarette, my man.
Ain't no big deal.

1085
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,316
l read, study.

1086
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,597
The first thing a black man must have
is respect for himself.

1087
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,629
Respect his body and his mind. Quit takin'
the white man's poisons into his body.

1088
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,995
His cigarettes, his dope, his liquor.

1089
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,435
His white woman. His pork.

1090
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,313
Pork?

1091
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,356
Hm.

1092
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,270
Yeah, my mama used to say that,
''Don't eat no pork.''

1093
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,399
Well, your mama was right.
Cos that pig is a filthy beast.

1094
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,110
Part rat, part cat. And the rest is dog.

1095
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,955
All right, pull my coat on this now.
What happen if you give all that up?

1096
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,589
l mean, the pork and... You get sick
and then you get a medical or somethin'?

1097
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,592
Like when l was on the outside,
l ran this hustle.

1098
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,555
- l tried to act like...
- l'm tellin' you God's words, not no hustle.

1099
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,518
And l'm gonna tell you, God is black.

1100
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,438
God is black?
Everybody knows God is white.

1101
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,795
Everything the white man taught you,
you accepted.

1102
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,678
He taught you you were a black heathen,
you believed him.

1103
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,639
He taught you to worship a blond,
blue-eyed Jesus with white skin,...

1104
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,756
..and you believed him.

1105
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,673
He taught you that black was a curse,
and you believe that.

1106
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,274
- Did you look up ''black'' in a dictionary?
- For what?

1107
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,715
Did you ever study anything
that wasn't part of some con?

1108
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,358
What the hell for, man?

1109
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,078
(sighs) Come with me.

1110
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,351
''Black.''

1111
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,716
''Destitute of light. Devoid of colour.''

1112
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,113
''Enveloped in darkness;
hence, utterly dismal or gloomy;...

1113
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,077
..as, the future looked bIack.''

1114
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,071
Pretty good with them words, ain't you?

1115
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,515
''Soiled with dirt, foul.''

1116
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,757
''Sullen, hostile.''

1117
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,314
''Forbidding; as, a black day.''

1118
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,319
''Foully or outrageously wicked;...

1119
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,958
..as, black cruelty.''

1120
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,476
''lndicating disgrace,
dishonour, or culpability.''

1121
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,551
And there's others.

1122
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,995
Blackmail, blackball, blackguard.

1123
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,470
- Hmm, well, that's somethin', all right.
- Let's look up ''white''.

1124
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,756
Here.

1125
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,956
Read.

1126
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,952
''White: of the colour of pure snow;...

1127
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,630
..reflecting all the rays of the spectrum.''

1128
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,353
''The opposite of bIack.''

1129
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,031
Um... ''Free from spot or blemish.''

1130
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,676
''lnnocent. Pure.''

1131
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,276
Huh!

1132
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,920
lsn't this somethin'? ''Without evil intent.''

1133
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,275
''Harmless. Honest.''

1134
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,113
''Square-dealing and honourable.''
Wait a minute. But this...

1135
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,397
This was written by white folks,
though, right? This is a white folks' book.

1136
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,119
- This sure ain't no black man's book.
- So what we readin' this one for?

1137
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,873
Because the truth is lying there
if you read behind the words.

1138
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:08,875
You got to take everything the white man
says and use it against him.

1139
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,356
Yeah?

1140
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,435
All right, but l mean,
there's a whole lotta words in here.

1141
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,910
- l mean...
- Here. We'll start at the beginning.

1142
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,798
We'll look 'em up, write 'em down
and find out what they mean.

1143
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,839
Here. Page one. The first word: aardvark.

1144
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,756
''Aardvark: earth pig.''

1145
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,796
''African ant-eating mammal.''

1146
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,749
''Abacus: a Chinese...

1147
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,750
..calculating instrument.''

1148
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,276
''Abaddon:
the place of the lost in... Sh...eol,...

1149
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,759
..the bottomless pit.''

1150
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,516
lf you take one step toward Allah,
He will take two steps toward you.

1151
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,431
(footsteps, coughing)

1152
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,439
- Lights out!
- (bell rings)

1153
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,910
Why you readin' them books?
You gonna be here longer than me.

1154
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,956
Lights out!

1155
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,277
(prisoner) Might as well put the book
down, seein' the light's out.

1156
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,510
He gonna go blind.

1157
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,552
(shouting)

1158
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,474
(shouting, applause)

1159
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,353
- (team) Oh, yeah!
- C'mon, Pete!

1160
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,116
(chuckles)
Boy'll wear out a baseball, won't he?

1161
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,159
- Hey, Chuck! What's the score, my man?
- Ten to one! We're murderin' them!

1162
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,593
Didn't you hear?

1163
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,477
No, what happened?

1164
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,993
The Brooklyn Dodgers
brought up Jackie Robinson.

1165
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,991
We're poundin' the hell out of 'em,
celebratin'!

1166
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,150
Yeah, that's all right!

1167
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,440
Sure. White man throw us a bone,...

1168
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,228
..and we are supposed to forget

1169
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:02,235
Yeah, but a nigger... a Negro playin' in
the big leagues, that's somethin', ain't it?

1170
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,637
l told you to go behind the words
and dig out the truth.

1171
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,038
They let us sing and dance and smile.

1172
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,038
And then they let
one so-called Negro into the majors.

1173
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,714
That doesn't cancel out
the greatest crime in history.

1174
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,874
When that crafty blue-eyed devil
locked us in chains, 1 00 million of us,...

1175
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,713
..broke up our families, tortured us,...

1176
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,833
..cut us off from our language,
our religion, our history.

1177
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,708
Let me tell you about black history.

1178
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,950
We are the original man.

1179
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,472
The first men on earth were black.
They ruled,...

1180
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,313
..and there wasn't a white face anywhere.

1181
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,360
But they teach us that we lived in caves
and swung from trees.

1182
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,874
That's a lie. Black men never did that.

1183
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,315
We were a race of kings...

1184
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,358
..when the white man crawled around
on all fours over the hills of Europe.

1185
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,000
Do they know who they are?

1186
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,031
Do you know where you came from?
What's your name?

1187
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,030
Malcolm Little.

1188
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,193
No. That's the name of the slave masters
who owned your family.

1189
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,676
You don't even know who you are.
You're nothing. Less than nothing.

1190
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,796
Who are you?

1191
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,795
Look, l ain't... Shit.

1192
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,720
All right, l ain't Malcolm Little, l ain't Red...

1193
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,314
- ..l damn sure ain't Satan.
- That's right. So who are you?

1194
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,995
- l don't know.
- We are a nation.

1195
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,320
The tribe of Shabazz,...

1196
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,074
..lost in this wilderness
called North America.

1197
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,516
Tribe of Shabazz.

1198
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,160
The merciful Allah
has sent us a messenger,...

1199
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,800
..a black man named Elijah Muhammad.

1200
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,316
He reveals to us
the true knowledge about ourselves.

1201
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,439
He teaches us that the true nature
of the original man, the black man,...

1202
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,556
..is righteousness.

1203
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,870
So if the nature of the black man
is righteousness, Malcolm...

1204
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,758
Then the true nature of the white man
is wickedness.

1205
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,592
l knew you'd get it.

1206
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,150
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us that the white man is a devil.

1207
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,674
Hm. l sure met some in my life.

1208
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,435
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say
that some white men are devils.

1209
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,874
He teaches us
that aIIwhite men are devils.

1210
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,389
Look, have you ever known
a good white man?

1211
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,869
l mean, think back in all your life.

1212
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,315
Have you ever met one who wasn't evil?

1213
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,755
(Baines) The body is a sacred tempIe.
It must be purified.

1214
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,673
l will not touch the white man's poison,...

1215
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,354
..his drugs, his liquor,...

1216
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,633
..his swine, his... women.

1217
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,192
A Muslim must be strikingly upright,
an outstanding example,...

1218
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,519
..so that those in the darkness
can see the power of the light.

1219
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,918
l will not commit adultery or fornication.

1220
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:12,592
l will not lie, cheat or steal.

1221
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,920
But the key to lslam is submission.

1222
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,515
That is why, five times daily,
we turn to Mecca to pray,...

1223
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,114
..to bend our knees in submission.

1224
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,080
l can't do that, Brother Baines.

1225
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,914
For lost-founds to bend their knees,
to admit their guilt,...

1226
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,714
..to implore Allah's forgiveness,...

1227
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,268
..is the hardest thing on earth.

1228
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,960
The hardest, and the greatest.

1229
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,233
l don't know what l would say to Allah.

1230
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,598
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?

1231
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,750
Yes, when l was, uh,...

1232
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,912
..when l was picking a lock
to rob someone's house.

1233
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,956
Tell Allah that.

1234
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,353
You can grovel and crawl for sin,
but not to save your soul?

1235
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,476
Pick the lock, Malcolm. Pick it.

1236
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,236
Brother, l want to.

1237
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,470
God knows, l want to.

1238
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,354
I received a Ietter that day
from The HonourabIe EIijah Muhammad.

1239
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:53,673
The dearHoIy ApostIe wrote to me,
a nobody, ajunkie, a pimp and a convict.

1240
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,797
(EIijah Muhammad)
I have come to give you...

1241
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,634
..something which can neverbe
taken away from you.

1242
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,032
I bring to you a sense ofyour own worth.

1243
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,080
The word of one human being.

1244
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,548
The knowledge of self.

1245
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,792
It was Iike a bIinding Iight, and I became
aware that he was in the room with me.

1246
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,276
He wore a dark suit, and on his face...

1247
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:22,990
..I saw a wisdom andpain so oId and deep
that I couId scarceIy Iook at him.

1248
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,477
But I knew I wasn't dreaming.
He was right there with me.

1249
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,716
l tell you,...

1250
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,276
..the most dangerous creation
in the world,...

1251
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,316
..in any society,...

1252
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,469
..is the man with nothing to lose.

1253
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,510
You do not need ten such men
to change the world.

1254
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,471
One will do.

1255
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,073
The earth belongs to us.

1256
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,912
The black man.

1257
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,835
And whatever is around it,
or on it, or in it...

1258
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,596
..belongs to us.

1259
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,071
And then, as suddenIy as he came,
he was gone.

1260
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,635
And then I couId do it.

1261
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:14,316
We are taught that PauI, on the road
to Damascus, heard the voice ofChrist.

1262
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,240
He was so smitten by the truth
that he feII from his horse.

1263
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,392
Now, I don't Iiken myseIfto PauI,
but I do understand.

1264
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,554
- You see, it happened to me.
- Aameen.

1265
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,231
(Baines) DearBrotherMaIcoIm,...

1266
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,153
..I am back in the bosom ofIsIam.
Praise AIIah.

1267
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,118
We don't have much,
but what we have is yours.

1268
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,795
My wife Lorraine and my son Sidneyjoin
me in saying that when you come out,...

1269
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,474
..which wiII not be too Iong,
come straight to us.

1270
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,516
Next!

1271
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,790
What'll it be, Little?

1272
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,036
Take it all off.

1273
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,874
- Oh, gettin' rid of that conk, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,119
You write thanking me.
(chuckIes) Don't thank me.

1275
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,920
Thank AIIah. He did it aII.

1276
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,556
(MaIcoIm) DearBrotherBaines,...

1277
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,393
..pIease thank The HonourabIe
EIijah Muhammad for the money,...

1278
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,268
..and teII him I have not written him
because I have notyetproven myseIf.

1279
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,113
- What is this?
- But I have shared his teachings...

1280
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,668
..with some ofmy oId running buddies
back in HarIem...

1281
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,718
..and with my main man Shorty,
who was transferred upstate.

1282
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,552
He's gone nuts.

1283
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,952
''Dear brothers, l thank you
for your endeared time and concern.''

1284
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,589
''All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad.''

1285
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,679
''l wrote the Mayor, the Governor
and the President,...

1286
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,877
..but for some reason,
l haven't heard from them.''

1287
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,915
Hm.

1288
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,639
(MaIcoIm) PIease teII The HonourabIe
EIijah Muhammad...

1289
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,474
..that I have dedicated my Iife to teIIing
the white deviI the truth to his face.

1290
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,358
I greetyou with the ancient words
ofpeace: As saIaam aIaikum.

1291
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,793
Wa-alaikum salaam.

1292
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,077
Oh. PS: I've finaIIy copied out
the entire dictionary.

1293
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,558
l think the brother is coming along.

1294
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,035
(metal door slams)

1295
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,192
''And the thief
cometh not but for to steal,...

1296
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,271
..and to kill...

1297
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,670
..and to destroy.''

1298
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,673
''But l am come,
that they might have life,...

1299
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,388
..and that they might have it
more abundantly.''

1300
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,111
St John 1 0. Verse 1 0.

1301
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,509
Are there any questions?

1302
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,593
Hey, watch it, baby.
This cat is heavy on religion.

1303
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,593
l can see this has become a struggle
between good and evil.

1304
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,999
Satan has a question.

1305
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,789
(laughs) Yes, sir, Chaplain Gill.
But since neither one of us are God,...

1306
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,713
..neither one of us is in any position
to say who's good and who's evil.

1307
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,153
Just ask your question.

1308
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,435
We were discussing the disciples.
What colour were they?

1309
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,036
Well, l don't think...

1310
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,156
..we know that for certain.

1311
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,310
- But they were Hebrews.
- That's right.

1312
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,516
As was Jesus. Jesus was also a Hebrew.

1313
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,679
- Just ask your question.
- What colour were the original Hebrews?

1314
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,196
l have told you
that we don't know that for certain.

1315
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,319
Then you can't believe for certain
that Jesus was white.

1316
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,677
Just, er, just a moment. Just a moment.

1317
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,718
God is white. lsn't it obvious?

1318
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,598
That is obvious,
but it's not obvious that God is white.

1319
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,750
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1320
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,195
..that Jesus did not have
blond hair and blue eyes.

1321
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,350
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us that the images of Jesus...

1322
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,557
...that are on prison walls and churches
throughout the world...

1323
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,916
..are not historically correct,
because history teaches us...

1324
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,436
..that Jesus was born in a region
where the people had colour.

1325
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,398
There is proof in the very Bible
that you ask us to read,...

1326
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,153
..in Revelations, first chapter,
verse 14 and 1 5,...

1327
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,949
..that Jesus had hair like wool
and feet the colour of brass.

1328
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,600
- Now, just... just what are you saying?
- l'm not saying anything.

1329
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,069
l'm proving to you that Jesus was not,...

1330
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:52,152
..and l might quote one of our lndian
brothers, he was not a paleface.

1331
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,196
(prisoners whisper and chuckle)

1332
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,713
- A-ha.
- Amen.

1333
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,516
(Chaplain) lsn't that interesting?

1334
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,068
(bell rings)

1335
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,999
Brother Malcolm!

1336
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,559
Brother Malcolm!

1337
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,030
He's waiting for you.

1338
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,436
My son.

1339
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,395
You have been a thief,...

1340
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,678
..a drug dealer, and a... and a hustler,...

1341
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,878
..and the world is still full of temptation.

1342
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,756
When God spoke to the devil
about how faithful Job was,...

1343
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,516
..the devil argued that it was only
God's protective hedge around him...

1344
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,795
..that kept him pure.

1345
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,749
Fact about it, the devil said
''Remove that hedge,...

1346
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,468
..and he will curse his Maker.''

1347
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,796
Well, Malcolm,...

1348
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,320
..your hedge has been removed.

1349
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,798
..and l believe...

1350
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:45,235
..you will remain faithful.

1351
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,876
Yes, sir.

1352
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,232
Thank you, sister. Brother Sidney, now
how many of these should we turn out?

1353
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,912
- 500.
- Make it 1 ,000.

1354
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,955
Yes, sir.

1355
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,429
Brother Malcolm, this is Brother Earl.
He just accepted the teachings.

1356
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,476
- As salaam alaikum, brother.
- Wa-alaikum salaam.

1357
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,394
Brother Earl is dedicated.
We need good men like him.

1358
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,717
l'm a willing servant
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad.

1359
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,075
OK, brothers, let's keep it busy.

1360
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,958
Take a real good look at where you live!
Not just where you live,...

1361
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,237
..but take a good look
at where everybody you know lives!

1362
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,551
Cos l don't want you to think
you just a bad luck accident!

1363
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,632
Then l want you go downtown,
over to Central Park West,...

1364
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,676
..and take a good look at how he lives!
(fades off)

1365
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,230
Look at how you live and how he lives!

1366
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,437
You've never seen
a Booker T Washington linguini store!

1367
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,511
You never went to a Jewish community...

1368
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,319
..and seen no Frederick Douglass
delicatessen!

1369
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,517
Why is everybody making money but us?

1370
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,239
(other speaker) Dick, Jane and Spot(!)

1371
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,480
The only thing that's black in the book
is the spot on the back of the dog's back!

1372
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,711
lt's time for us to use our dollars...

1373
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,314
We can do what everyone else can do!

1374
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,393
lf we become producers, and if we
become the masters of our own destiny,...

1375
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,517
..we can have wool from sheep
just like anyone else!

1376
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,636
But where are our clothing stores?

1377
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,474
We can get milk from cows like anyone
else! But where are our grocery stores?

1378
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,473
We need to control our dollars!
We need to control our destiny!

1379
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:12,279
The only thing they respect is our dollars!

1380
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,079
The only thing they respect
is the wealth that we give them!

1381
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,116
Where's that freedom
that you and l are supposed to have?

1382
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,156
The Statue of Liberty's standin' like this,...

1383
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,550
..and for you and l, it might as well be
sayin' ''Stop! Don't come no further!''

1384
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:25,200
This is what it be sayin'!
''Don't come no further!''

1385
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,235
That's right!

1386
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,154
So what l want you to do, brothers and
sisters, is come on down to the temple.

1387
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,392
Oh! l'm so surprised! l'm so surprised!

1388
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,438
Y'all been in church two hours and
you're expectin' to see heaven out here,...

1389
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,909
..and there ain't no heaven!
You're still right here on earth!

1390
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,878
Sister, why don't you come on down
to the temple at two o'clock?

1391
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,916
Hear the truth! Hear the black man's truth!

1392
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,800
No, you can't deny it! You've been on your
knees the last two hours, haven't you,...

1393
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,394
..beggin' some God
to help you in the hereafter.

1394
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,836
But the hereafter's right now, brother!
The hereafter is here and now!

1395
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,718
Let me... Let me talk to you for one
second, brother. Now, listen to me.

1396
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,792
Now, l know you a smart man. l can tell.
You're a wise man. You look good.

1397
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,395
Now, you're in here in this church
every day, prayin' to this God.

1398
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,675
l'm tellin' you,
these so-called white Christians,...

1399
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,274
..they're hangin' our black Christians
from trees, brother!

1400
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,909
The man hates you! He says he loves you,
but he doesn't do anything for you!

1401
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,956
He tells you to foam at the mouth,...

1402
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,634
..to faint and sing and shout,
and hope for something in the hereafter.

1403
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,280
We can have it right now, brother.
We can have it right now.

1404
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,316
- Come on down. As salaam alaikum.
- Yeah. l'll see you later.

1405
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,550
Do you know what that means, brother?
''Peace be unto you.''

1406
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,677
My beautiful black sisters,
can l have a moment of your time?

1407
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,513
Don't be ashamed when l call you black.

1408
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,194
Cos you're beautiful. Black is beautiful.

1409
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:35,989
You don't have to come here every day
beggin' these folks for a job!

1410
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,992
Why, you can wash their clothes for 'em,
scrub their floors,...

1411
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,878
..rock their little brats to sleep
for the rest of your life!

1412
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,030
You'll still end up poor
and without anything.

1413
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,156
And yet you're here on the auction block!

1414
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,357
They're examining you
like a chicken, or a horse, or a slave!

1415
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,355
You see this here? This is who you are.
Beautiful. Your beautiful black selves.

1416
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,000
With pride, and dignity. ln fact...

1417
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:02,030
Uh... l'd also expect you
to work one Saturday every month,...

1418
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,190
..and occasionally into the evening.
l hope my...

1419
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,995
You see, these are the questions!

1420
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,152
The questions you and l have to ask.
How did we get this mind?

1421
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:18,994
You're not an American. You're an African
who happens to be an American.

1422
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,036
You have to understand the difference.

1423
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,510
We didn't come over on the Nina, the
Pinta and the... and the Whatchamacallit!

1424
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,309
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock!
Plymouth Rock landed on us!

1425
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,109
Landed right on top of us!

1426
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,516
Shorty?

1427
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,114
ls that you, brother?

1428
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:42,030
Praise be to Allah. That's what l'm talking
about, the slave mentality, the slave mind.

1429
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,350
This brother and l, we had the slave mind.

1430
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:48,592
We used to rob together, sleep with white
women. We even went to prison together.

1431
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,671
Now, don't be surprised
when l say we went to prison,...

1432
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,832
..cos some of y'all still in prison.
Prisons of your mind.

1433
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,150
Stand up, brother. C'mon.

1434
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,438
(chuckles) The brother's a little shy.
Come on, brother! Give me a hug.

1435
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,713
Yeah!

1436
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,958
That's all right, brother. That's all right.

1437
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,996
He's still got his hair fried.
That's all right, though.

1438
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,674
- That's the slave mind.
- (laughter)

1439
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,036
l gotta hand it to you, Red,
best preacher hype l ever did hear.

1440
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,917
No hype, brother. lt's the truth.

1441
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,070
Why don't you come on back down
to the temple and hear some more?

1442
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,277
- Man, l can't pay that shit no mind.
- Brother, you need to pay it aII your mind.

1443
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,477
- What mind you have left.
- Take it easy, greasy. This is me. Shorty!

1444
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,589
Let's go around the corner. (sniffs)

1445
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,431
No, sir. Not any more.
l've been clean for eight years, brother.

1446
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,192
- Eight years?
- Eight years.

1447
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,236
You are somethin', homey.

1448
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,356
My trouble is l love pig's feet
and white women too much.

1449
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,715
- (laughs)
- l damn sure can't be no Muslim!

1450
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,991
That's cos you're lost, brother.
That's cos you're lost.

1451
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,435
But we can find you.

1452
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,799
- So what d'you hear about the old gang?
- Heard about Sammy?

1453
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:58,238
Dead. Knocked overin a bed with a chick

1454
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,353
Had 25 grand in his pocket aIso.

1455
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,476
Guess it was his lucky number(!)

1456
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,473
What about, uh...
What was that brother's name?

1457
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:10,199
CadiIIac? Gone, too?

1458
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,512
Hooked on heroin. Been in and out
ofLexington five orsix times.

1459
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,036
- Sophia?
- Still happily married to that rich ofay.

1460
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,714
- She married him?
- She married him.

1461
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,189
- Went for the money.
- The money.

1462
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,714
Thank you, honey.

1463
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,957
l haven't seen West lndian Archie.

1464
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,952
Grapevine says he Iives in the Bronx,...

1465
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,076
..ifyou want to caII that Iivin '.

1466
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:37,119
- Shorty, it's been good seein'you.
- Same here, Red.

1467
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,070
- You in?
- (slurs) Get the hell away from me.

1468
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,116
Bitch!

1469
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,949
- (knock at door)
- l'll pay you tomorrow!

1470
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,991
How you doing, Archie?

1471
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,710
My man Red.

1472
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,756
C'mere, man.

1473
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,914
No, don't get up. lt's all right.

1474
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,636
(whispers) Yes.

1475
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,196
ls...

1476
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,316
..really you, Red?

1477
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,196
Yes, it's me.

1478
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,756
l came to, uh,...

1479
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,277
..just to thank you.

1480
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,110
Thank you for saving my life.

1481
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,510
When l think back to when
we were on the streets of Harlem,...

1482
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:54,673
- ..tryin' to gun each other down...
- l wasn't gonna shoot you, man.

1483
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,800
lt was...

1484
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,076
..just my rep. Y'know?

1485
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,915
All l had was my rep.

1486
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,676
But now,...

1487
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,396
..you tell me this.

1488
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,479
You didn't really have that number?

1489
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,430
l don't know, Archie, l...

1490
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,637
l really don't even remember.
That's not even important.

1491
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,553
The important thing now
is to get you back on your feet.

1492
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,593
Yeah. Y'know, l have some angles...

1493
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,950
..ain't been figured yet.

1494
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,034
(grunts)

1495
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,955
Archie, here. Hang on.

1496
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,190
- (grunts)
- lt's all right.

1497
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,676
Help me with my arm. (exhales heavily)

1498
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,389
- All right.
- Have to exercise my arm.

1499
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,476
Here?

1500
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,636
Yeah.

1501
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:02,079
- That's better?
- Yeah. lt feels good.

1502
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,912
Good.

1503
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,995
- Yes, right here!
- Sweetness, l got somethin' for you, baby!

1504
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,877
What happened to our women?

1505
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,999
They couId have been doctors,
orIawyers, or teachers, ormothers?

1506
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,957
Who's going to raise our chiIdren?

1507
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,393
What happened to ourmen?

1508
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,720
They couId have been mathematicians,
eIectricians orphysicians.

1509
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,870
What happened to 'em?
What's the IittIe boy gonna do,...

1510
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,191
..when he's Iookin' forhis father
and his father's downtown injaiI?

1511
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,874
What's the IittIe girI gonna do
when she's Iookin' forhermother...

1512
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,520

- Laura! Laura, wait up for me!

1513
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,309
No, I'm teIIing you that deviI
has made dead souIs out ofyou and I!

1514
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,709
- You're dead! You're dead spirits!
- Take the money.

1515
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,920
Put your money away.

1516
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,319
You're dead
to the knowIedge ofyourseIf!

1517
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,356
You're dead

1518
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,396
..andyou're dead

1519
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,474
My brothers and sisters, he shouId get
down on his knees, and beg ourmercy!

1520
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,516
Oh, my brothers and sisters,...

1521
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,309
..his kind has committed God's greatest
crime against your and my kind,...

1522
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,516
- ..every day of his life!
- (cheering)

1523
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,195
He oughta get on his knees
and say he's committed a crime!

1524
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,033
But does he do that? Does he do that? No!

1525
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,749
No, he scorns you.
He splits your head with his night stick!

1526
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,513
He busts you upside the head
with that billy club!

1527
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,272
And he calls you a nigger!

1528
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:17,239
l'm tellin' you, he calls you a coon!
That's what he says to you! ''Boy! Nigger!''

1529
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,560
- 400 years is long enough.
- (approving shouts)

1530
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:23,030
You've been sittin' down and layin' down
and bowin' down for 400 years.

1531
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:26,590
l think it's time to stand up.
l think it's time to stand up.

1532
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,797
- We're with you, Brother Malcolm!
- All right! Bless you.

1533
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:32,235
- Bless you.
- We're together.

1534
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,833
- Praise him! Praise him!
- Come on up.

1535
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,835
- Glory, my Lord! Praise him! Praise him!
- Yeah!

1536
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,989
Praise him!

1537
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,868
- Praise him!
- How you doin'?

1538
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,111
Yeah. All right. Yes. Good to see you.

1539
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,760
(excited chatter)

1540
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,236
Yes, sir. Next Wednesday, eight o'clock.

1541
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,278
- l'll be there!
- l'll see you there.

1542
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,430
Brother Baines? Excuse me, sister.

1543
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,353
You think we can, uh,
get a loudspeaker set up outside?

1544
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,876
l'm sure we can.
Brother Malcolm, this is Sister Betty.

1545
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,758
She lectures our Muslim women
on hygiene and diet.

1546
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:12,037
She stresses care for the body
and regular eating habits.

1547
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,314
Good. Good.

1548
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,756
- As salaam alaikum.
- Wa-alaikum salaam, sister.

1549
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,154
Brother Minister, your sister wonders...

1550
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,993
..if you know what
Sister Harriet Tubman did...

1551
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,878
..between taking souls
to the Promised Land.

1552
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,554
Uh, l don't know. What's that, sister?

1553
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,556
She ate.

1554
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,076
Excuse me.

1555
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,116
She's interesting.

1556
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:48,670
So, Brother Minister, l was hoping that
you would come and speak to my class.

1557
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,320
Yes. Yes, l'll speak to your class.

1558
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,637
- But l'm a hard man on the women.
- Are you?

1559
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,109
Yes, we have to be careful
when it comes to women.

1560
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:03,479
Because too many of our women,
they have too much of the devil in 'em.

1561
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,758
Bleachin' and dyein' and...

1562
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,835
..ironin' their hair.

1563
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,916
Runnin' around in the streets half-naked.

1564
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:19,476
(snorts) Talkin' too much,
listenin' to the wrong men.

1565
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,030
Makin' em deceitful,
untrustworthy, fresh...

1566
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,475
And you men are to blame, too.

1567
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,040
We don't protect, we don't value,
we don't even support them.

1568
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,508
See, the building of a new nation...

1569
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,750
..begins with the woman.

1570
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:39,118
Because the mother
is the first teacher of the child.

1571
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,320
The message she gives that child,...

1572
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,595
..the child gives to the world,
so we have to be very careful.

1573
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,592
When it comes to... to choosing a mate,...

1574
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,956
..Samson,
the strongest man that ever lived,...

1575
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,316
..was destroyed by the woman
that slept in his arms.

1576
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,789
Should l tell my sisters, then, that...

1577
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,440
..we don't believe in marriage?

1578
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,159
No! (chuckles) We don't oppose marriage.

1579
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:05,994
Cos we're not Catholic priests.
We don't believe in celibacy, no.

1580
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,355
Mr Muhammad teaches us
that if a woman is, uh,...

1581
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,159
..the right height for a man,
the right complexion...

1582
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:15,279
lf she's half the man's age, plus seven,....

1583
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:22,995
..and if she understands
that man's essential nature is strong,...

1584
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,594
..and she's willin' to support that,...

1585
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,636
..and if she's, uh,...

1586
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:31,679
..if she can sew, and she can cook,
and, um, loves children,...

1587
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,876
..and stays out of trouble...

1588
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,032
l think you've made your points,
Brother Minister Malcolm.

1589
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,192
- Good.
- You haven't any time for marriage.

1590
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,599
- No.
- (both laugh)

1591
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:45,958
So what l'll do is put the chapters down,
l'll write them down for you.

1592
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:46,995
All right.

1593
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:50,516
As well as the New Testament chapters
of St Matthew.

1594
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,999
- Brother Minister.
- Yes?

1595
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,878
l hope that doesn't mean you won't
come and visit my class, though.

1596
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,030
Oh, no! No. l'd love to come to your class.

1597
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,395
- (chuckles)
- l love to teach. l love sharing.

1598
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,596
You see, this is the wonderful thing
about Mr Muhammad.

1599
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,194
When he gives you this knowledge, when
he shares this knowledge with you,...

1600
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:08,560
- ..you can't help but to run out and...
- Excuse me, um, Brother Minister,...

1601
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,314
..would it be OK
if we just sat down for a moment?

1602
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,790
- lt's a pretty big building, and, uh...
- Oh, yes.

1603
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,996
- (chuckles)
- Yes, sister. l'm sorry.

1604
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,719
- l've had you on your feet all day.
- Oh, no. No, no.

1605
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,554
- My mistake.
- You've been on your feet for days.

1606
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:28,596
And, uh,...
you didn't even finish your salad.

1607
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,519
- So, let's talk about you for a change.
- Mm.

1608
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,594
- How tall are you?
- Why do you ask?

1609
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,352
- ldle question.
- Oh.

1610
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,710
Well, if it's just an idle question,
l hope you won't force me to answer it.

1611
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,832
(chuckles) No. l won't force you.

1612
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:55,553
Well, Brother Baines says
that l'm tall enough for a tall man.

1613
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,555
He's briefed you also, then?
(laughs) How old are you, sister?

1614
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,560
You know, Brother Malcolm,...

1615
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:07,189
..there are a few things about women
that you don't understand.

1616
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,115
- Some of us, we're possessive, very vain.
- Are you?

1617
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:14,510
And persistent,
when we've set our mind to something.

1618
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,431
What have you set your mind to?

1619
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,835
Being a good Muslim,...

1620
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,190
..a good nurse,...

1621
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,716
..and a good wife.

1622
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,870
Brother Malcolm?

1623
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,678
- Excuse me, Sister Betty.
- Certainly.

1624
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:33,228
Brother Malcolm, Brother Johnson
was attacked by the police.

1625
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,031
Excuse me, sister.

1626
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,156
- There was a scuffle!
- The brother was just watchin'!

1627
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,710
- The cop came along, he said ''Move on!''
- Didn't move quick enough for the ofay!

1628
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,916
Crack! He was bleedin' like a stuck hog!

1629
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,991
So what you gonna do?

1630
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,439
He'll rap a little. He's a MusIim.

1631
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,877
But you ain't gonna do nothin'
but make a speech.

1632
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,236
Muslims taIk a good game,
but they never do nothin'.

1633
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,629
Unless somebody bothers Muslims.

1634
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,794
- Charlie, wait up.
- More troublemakers. Here they come.

1635
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:18,149
(* radio pIays Perry Como:
''RoundAnd Round'')

1636
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,959
We demand to see Brother Johnson.

1637
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,031
Who the hell are you?

1638
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,872
l'm the minister
for Muslim Temple Number Seven.

1639
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,110
- Never heard of you.
- Where is he?

1640
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,431
- Nobody here by that name.
- Wait a second. What is your name, fella?

1641
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,954
Don't worry about what my name is.

1642
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,429
Two witnesses saw Brother Johnson
brought in here, beat up.

1643
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,512
- Nobody saw him brought out.
- You didn't hear the sergeant?

1644
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,478
- Outside.
- l suggest you look outside that window.

01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,390
* In the night, you see the ovaI moon

1647
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:53,270
* Going round and round in tune

1648
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:56,636
- Jimmy, c'mere a second.
- Yes, we intend to see Brother Johnson.

1649
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,037
- Who the hell are they supposed to be?
- They're brothers of Brother Johnson.

1650
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,313
Eddie, let me take a look at that blotter.

1651
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,036
Uh...

1652
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,518
Yeah. We got a Muslim.
Relief musta put it down.

1653
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,238
- Must have.
- Yeah, but you can't see him.

1654
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,596
- Because you ain't his lawyer.
- No lawyer, no see.

1655
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:29,037
Well, until l am satisfied Brother Johnson
is receiving proper medical care,...

1656
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,111
..nobody will move.

1657
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,628
* Then yourIove,
you'II hoId herround, round, round

1658
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,958
* In yourheart's a song
with a brand-new...

1659
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,196
Get an ambulance.

1660
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,076
Now!

1661
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,478
(siren wails)

1662
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,150
All right, break it up!
You got what you wanted.

1663
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,629
No. l'm not satisfied.

1664
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,398
To the hospital.

1665
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:13,152
(* miIitary drumbeat)

1666
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:19,154
(crowd murmurs)

1667
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,514
- Walk on!
- (shouts and conversation)

1668
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,232
Sidney, come on!

1669
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,758
(crowd shouts)

1670
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,636
Keep fightin', son!

1671
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:50,157
- (siren wails)
- (shouting and chanting)

1672
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:09,310
(crowd) We want justice!
We want justice! We want justice!

1673
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,188
All right, that's enough.
l want these people moved outta here.

1674
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:17,671
Fruit of lslam are disciplined men.
They haven't broken any laws. Yet.

1675
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,479
- What about them?
- That's your headache, Captain.

1676
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,757
- But if Brother Johnson dies, l pity you.
- We want justice!

1677
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,273
Doctor?

1678
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,669
He'll live.
He's getting the best care we can give.

1679
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,954
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Certainly.

1680
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,429
- We want justice!
- All right. OK.

1681
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,636
Now let's disperse this mob!

1682
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,472
We want justice! We want justice!

1683
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:40,831
We want justice! We want justice!

1684
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:44,192
We want justice! We want justice!

1685
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,756
We want justice! We want justice!

1686
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,353
We want justice!

1687
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,192
(scattered shouts)

1688
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:26,917
That's too much power
for one man to have.

1689
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,272
Brother Minister,
l'm ready to take some heads.

1690
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,709
We gotta do somethin'
to put fear in those devils!

1691
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,552
Look, l'm ready to do something also.

1692
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:37,154
Chicago said to be patient,
that's what we're gonna do.

1693
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,993
- l'm tired of being patient!
- Well, then you get on the phone...

1694
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,949
(lowers voice) You get on the phone and
you call Chicago, let Mr Muhammad know.

1695
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:48,398
(EIijah Muhammad) I am here
to bring a soIution to the probIems of...

1696
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:54,669
..(chuckIes) the so-caIIed Negro
and his white sIave master.

1697
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,074
You are seeking something.

1698
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,635
- Have a seat, son.
- You are seeking...

1699
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:04,871
..an answer to your400 years ofsIavery.

1700
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,918
Y'know, the only thing l like integrated...

1701
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,558
..is my coffee.

1702
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,110
- (laughs)
- What can l do for you?

1703
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,356
Well, Mr X, uh...

1704
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,430
..my name is Benjamin.
And l was out there tonight.

1705
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,070
Take it easy, now.

1706
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,833
And... and l saw what it is that you did.

1707
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,230
l mean, the way you talked
to them policemen and all.

1708
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,995
Well, Mr X,...

1709
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,876
..l wanna be a Muslim.

1710
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,078
l mean, l ain't never seen a nigger,
uh, l mean, coloured person...

1711
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,836
..Negro...

1712
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,115
..talk to no police like that before.

1713
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,555
You want to be a Muslim,
join the Nation of lslam.

1714
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:57,110
- Yes, sir.
- You know what it means to be a Muslim?

1715
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:01,156
Do you?

1716
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:06,479
Um... (clears throat) No, not exactly.
But l wanna be one.

1717
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,118
l mean, just like you.

1718
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,158
You should never join any organisation
unless you know exactly what it's about.

1719
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,599
The Church has faiIedyou!

1720
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,830
Thank you, brother.

1721
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,673
You shouldn't give up so easily, either.

1722
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,470
We can use more young warriors
like yourself.

1723
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:32,348
Come on by the temple,
next Wednesday, eight o'clock sharp.

1724
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,317
Yes. Eight o'clock sharp.

1725
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,676
Thank you, Mr X.
And l won't make you out a liar, neither.

1726
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,079
No, l don't think you will.

1727
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,796
All right!

1728
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:48,432
(chuckles)

1729
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,118
Tonight,...

1730
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:57,158
..l shall introduce you
as my National Minister.

1731
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,954
lt will be a difficult task.

1732
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,356
Your assignment...

1733
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:06,398
..is to build temples all over this nation.

1734
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,233
More work
than you've ever done in your life.

1735
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:10,992
- Yes, sir.
- (chuckles)

1736
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:15,437
You will be in the public eye.
Beware of them cameras.

1737
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,155
Oh, those cameras are...

1738
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,915
..bad as any narcotic.

1739
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,160
White devil be watchin' your every step.

1740
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,118
- Yes.
- And your own brothers will be...

1741
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,156
..jealous,...

1742
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,196
..hostile.

1743
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,998
Go slowly.

1744
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,191
Yes, sir.

1745
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,032
Here is a glass.

1746
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,509
Mm-hm.

1747
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:50,279
Dirty. The water? Foul.

1748
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,438
lf you offer this to the people,
they have no choice.

1749
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:00,396
They'll drink from it, if they're thirsty.

1750
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,235
- (chuckles)
- But if you offer them...

1751
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,356
..this glass,...

1752
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:11,673
..and let them make their own decision,...

1753
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:15,592
..they will choose the pure vessel.

1754
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:21,236
lslam is the only religion...

1755
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:25,797
..that addresses the needs
and the problems...

1756
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,836
..of the so-called Negro in America,...

1757
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,115
- ..especially in the slums,...
- Right.

1758
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,156
..ghettos.

1759
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:36,279
lslam is the only way
out of drugs, and crime, and...

1760
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:40,069
..unemployment, prostitution, alcohol,...

1761
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,756
..gambling and... adultery, fornication.

1762
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:48,835
This sweet, gentIe man
at whose feet I kneeIed,...

1763
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,876
..gave me the truth from his own mouth.

1764
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,359
Present them the pure vessel.

1765
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:56,194
And I adored him in the sense of
the Latin root ofthe word ''adorare'',...

1766
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,748
..which means to worship and to fear.

1767
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,831
He was the first man I ever feared,...

1768
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:03,798
..and I don't mean fear
such as one has ofa gun,...

1769
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,998
..but the fear one has ofthe...
ofthe power ofthe sun.

1770
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,072
I pIedged myseIfto him,
even ifit cost me my Iife.

01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,190
l've never told you this.

1801
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,518
But the very first time l ever saw you,...

1802
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,629
..standing up on the podium,...

1803
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:57,479
..you were cleaning your glasses,...

1804
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,875
..and l felt so sorry for you.

1805
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,716
- Sorry for me?
- Mm-hm.

1806
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,789
Why?

1807
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:10,112
Because no-one as young as you
should be so serious.

1808
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,600
But l don't think that any more.

1809
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:17,796
What do you think?

1810
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:22,553
l want to have a Iot of babies with you.

1811
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,515
(softly) Dear heart.

1812
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:31,436
- (knock at door)
- l love you.

1813
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,352
We're waitin' on you folks.
You tryin' to starve us?

1814
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,750
Brother Malcolm, Sister Betty,...

1815
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:45,833
..we pray that Allah blesses you
with a happy and a fruitful marriage.

1816
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,115
(laughter)

1817
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,476
That's right!
Congratulations, Brother Minister!

1818
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:53,790
- Congratulations!
- You made the front page!

1819
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,871
Check it out! Front page!

1820
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:58,474
(laughter and applause)

1821
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:04,238
l must emphasise that The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad is not a politician.

1822
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:08,074
So l'm not here this afternoon
as a Republican,...

1823
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,557
- ..nor as a Democrat.
- Tell us, brother!

1824
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:15,269
- Not as a Mason, nor as an Elk.
- Tell us what you here for!

1825
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,238
- Not as a Protestant, nor a Catholic.
- That's right!

1826
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,993
- Not as a Christian, nor a Jew.
- C'mon, man! All right, now.

1827
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:23,992
- Not as a Baptist nor a Methodist. ln fact...
- Come on, brother! Come on!

1828
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,469
- ..not even as an American.
- (approving shouts)

1829
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,755
Because if l was an American,...

1830
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,274
..the problem that confronts
our people today wouldn't even exist!

1831
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,272
- That's right!
- So now we ain't Americans, huh?

1832
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:38,717
So l have to stand here today
as what l was when l was born.

1833
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:42,874
- A black man.
- (shouting and applause)

1834
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,959
Before there was any such thing
as a Republican or a Democrat,...

1835
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:49,393
..we were black.

1836
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:53,234
Before there was any such thing
as a Mason or an Elk, we were black.

1837
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:57,677
Before there was any such thing as a Jew
or a Christian, we were black people.

1838
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,878
ln fact, before there was any such place
as America, we were black.

1839
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:07,154
And after America has long passed from
the scene, there will still be black people.

1840
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,196
(cheering)

1841
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,748
l'm gonna tell it like it really is!

1842
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:16,911
Every election year, these politicians
are sent up here to pacify us!

1843
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,798
They're sent here and set up here
by the white man!

1844
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:23,999
This is what they do! They send drugs
into Harlem down here to pacify us!

1845
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,799
They send alcohol down here to pacify us!

1846
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,077
They send prostitution
down here to pacify us!

1847
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:33,789
You can't even get drugs in Harlem
without the white man's permission!

1848
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,031
You can't get prostitution in Harlem
without the white man's permission!

1849
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:40,112
You can't get gambling in Harlem
without the white man's permission!

1850
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,998
Every time you break the seal
on that liquor bottle,...

1851
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,640
..that's a government seal
you're breaking!

1852
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:48,109
No, l say and l say it again,...

1853
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,953
..you've been had! You've been took!

1854
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:54,635
- Right on, brother!
- You've been hoodwinked! Bamboozled!

1855
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:58,395
Led astray! Run amok!
This is what he does.

1856
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:01,552
Y'know,
some people call this hate teaching.

1857
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,437
But this isn't hate teaching.

1858
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,795
- This is love teaching.
- (approving shouts)

1859
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,599
- l wouldn't tell you this if l didn't love you.
- No, you wouldn't!

1860
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:11,114
l wouldn't stick my neck out for you
if l didn't love you.

1861
01:54:11,314 --> 01:54:14,306
l want you to understand one thing,
everything that l teach you,...

1862
01:54:14,394 --> 01:54:16,430
..everything that l've said to you,...

1863
01:54:16,514 --> 01:54:20,826
..has been taught to me
by this dear man, this divine man.

1864
01:54:20,914 --> 01:54:22,427
Yes, sir!

1865
01:54:22,514 --> 01:54:25,711
All praise is due to Allah
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

1866
01:54:25,794 --> 01:54:28,866
- (Malcolm X) Oh, yes!
- (Betty) AttaIIah's fine,...

1867
01:54:28,954 --> 01:54:31,149
..and misses you as much as I do.

1868
01:54:31,234 --> 01:54:33,907
But the news thatyou've
dedicated fournew tempIes...

1869
01:54:33,994 --> 01:54:36,030
..is aImost as good as having you with us.

1870
01:54:36,114 --> 01:54:40,107
- (MaIcoIm X) And the white peopIe...
- (Betty) PIease take care ofyourseIf.

1871
01:54:40,194 --> 01:54:43,630
..try to hide theirguiIt by accusing
The HonourabIe EIijah Muhammad...

1872
01:54:43,714 --> 01:54:45,750
..ofbeing a bIack supremacist,...

1873
01:54:45,834 --> 01:54:48,268
..simpIy because he's trying
to upIift the mentaIity,...

1874
01:54:48,354 --> 01:54:50,743
..the sociaI and economic
condition ofhis peopIe.

1875
01:54:50,834 --> 01:54:52,034
And the Jews,...

1876
01:54:52,034 --> 01:54:54,992
..who have been guiIty ofexpIoiting
bIack peopIe forI don't know how Iong,...

1877
01:54:55,074 --> 01:54:58,032
..try to hide theirguiIt by accusing
The HonourabIe EIijah Muhammad...

1878
01:54:58,114 --> 01:55:00,674
..ofbeing anti-Semitic,...

1879
01:55:00,754 --> 01:55:04,110
..simply because he's trying
to teach you and l...

1880
01:55:04,194 --> 01:55:07,231
SimpIy because he's trying
to teach you and I to...

1881
01:55:07,314 --> 01:55:09,430
..to be in charge ofthe businesses
in our own community,...

1882
01:55:09,514 --> 01:55:12,233
..to own the businesses
in our own community,...

1883
01:55:12,314 --> 01:55:14,509
..to have economic Ieadership
in our own community!

1884
01:55:14,594 --> 01:55:18,064
- No! No, this isn't bIack supremacy!
- (screaming and shouting)

1885
01:55:18,154 --> 01:55:20,224
- This is bIack inteIIigence!
- That's right!

1886
01:55:20,314 --> 01:55:22,145
- That's right!
- (appIause)

1887
01:55:22,234 --> 01:55:23,462
Come on!

1888
01:55:25,714 --> 01:55:28,069
l didn't do nothin'! l didn't do nothin'!

1889
01:55:28,154 --> 01:55:30,429
(appIause, TV announcer)

1890
01:55:33,194 --> 01:55:35,230
* We are not afraid... *

1891
01:55:35,314 --> 01:55:37,270
The bIack peopIe in this country...

1892
01:55:37,354 --> 01:55:39,265
Keep those peopIe back!

1893
01:55:39,354 --> 01:55:44,189
..have been the victims ofvioIence
at the hands ofthe American white man...

1894
01:55:44,274 --> 01:55:46,834
..for400 years.

1895
01:55:52,714 --> 01:55:57,230
And we thought, by foIIowing
those ignorant Negro preachers,...

1896
01:55:57,314 --> 01:56:02,468
..it was godIike to turn the other cheek
to the brute that was brutaIising us!

1897
01:56:02,554 --> 01:56:07,912
A hundred years ago, they used to put on
white sheets and sic bloodhounds on us.

1898
01:56:08,754 --> 01:56:11,268
Well, nowadays
they've traded in the sheets...

1899
01:56:11,354 --> 01:56:12,912
Well, some of them have.

1900
01:56:12,994 --> 01:56:14,029
(appIause)

1901
01:56:14,114 --> 01:56:16,309
- They've traded in the sheets...
- (appIause sweIIs)

1902
01:56:16,394 --> 01:56:20,512
PIease... pIease. They've traded in
those white sheets forpoIice uniforms.

1903
01:56:20,594 --> 01:56:24,348
They've traded in
the bIoodhounds forpoIice dogs.

1904
01:56:24,434 --> 01:56:27,107
Andjust Iike that oId UncIe Tom
back during sIavery time,...

1905
01:56:27,194 --> 01:56:29,469
We must remain true to non-vioIence.

1906
01:56:29,554 --> 01:56:32,193
I'm asking everybody in the Iine,...

1907
01:56:32,274 --> 01:56:34,424
..ifyou can't be non-vioIent, don't get in it.

1908
01:56:34,514 --> 01:56:37,551
..teaching us to love our enemy
and pray for those who use us spitefully,...

1909
01:56:37,634 --> 01:56:41,673
..you got these chicken-peckin' Uncle Tom
so-called Negro leaders today...

1910
01:56:41,754 --> 01:56:43,949
But isn't it a great day?

1911
01:56:44,034 --> 01:56:47,709
You've got these
UncIe Tom Negro Ieaders today,...

1912
01:56:47,794 --> 01:56:50,388
..that are teIIing us
we oughta pray for our enemy,...

1913
01:56:50,474 --> 01:56:52,510
..we oughta Iove our enemy,...

1914
01:56:52,594 --> 01:56:55,791
..we oughta integrate with an enemy
who bombs us, who kiIIs and shoots us,...

1915
01:56:55,874 --> 01:57:00,152
..who Iynches us,
who rapes our women and chiIdren. No!

1916
01:57:00,234 --> 01:57:02,304
- That's right! C'mon!
- No!

1917
01:57:02,474 --> 01:57:06,387
No! That's not inteIIigent.
That's not inteIIigent!

1918
01:57:06,474 --> 01:57:09,272
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to teach you and l...

1919
01:57:09,354 --> 01:57:12,585
..that just as the white man, and any
other man, for that matter, on this earth,...

1920
01:57:12,674 --> 01:57:15,825
..has the God-given right,
the human right, the civil right,...

1921
01:57:15,914 --> 01:57:19,065
...the natural right and any other kind
of high rights you can think of...

1922
01:57:19,154 --> 01:57:21,190
..to protect himself,...

1923
01:57:21,274 --> 01:57:24,550
..just as this white man
has the right to defend himself,...

1924
01:57:24,834 --> 01:57:27,951
..we have the right
to defend ourselves, too.

1925
01:57:28,034 --> 01:57:29,474
This is only natural.

1926
01:57:29,474 --> 01:57:32,227
This is what The Honourable Elijah
Muhammad is trying to teach you and l.

1927
01:57:32,314 --> 01:57:36,705
He's not teaching us to hate the white
man. He's teaching us to love ourselves.

1928
01:57:38,034 --> 01:57:41,709
MrX, before we begin
our discussion tonight,...

1929
01:57:41,794 --> 01:57:45,343
..''The BIack MusIims: Hate Mongers'',...

1930
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:49,222
..wouIdyou mind expIaining for us
the meaning ofyourname,...

1931
01:57:49,314 --> 01:57:51,874
..which is the Ietter... X?

1932
01:57:51,954 --> 01:57:54,024
Yes, uh, during slavery time,...

1933
01:57:54,114 --> 01:57:57,584
..the slave master gave the Negro,
so-called Negro,...

1934
01:57:58,114 --> 01:58:01,948
..uh, named the so-called Negro
after themselves.

1935
01:58:02,034 --> 01:58:03,990
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
teaches us...

1936
01:58:04,074 --> 01:58:07,589
..that once we come into the knowledge
of lslam, the knowledge of ourselves,...

1937
01:58:07,674 --> 01:58:10,434
..we replace our slave name with an X,...

1938
01:58:10,434 --> 01:58:13,471
..X in mathematics
representing the unknown.

1939
01:58:13,554 --> 01:58:15,510
Since we've been
disconnected or cut off...

1940
01:58:15,594 --> 01:58:19,473
..from our own history, our own past,
our own culture, our own land,...

1941
01:58:19,554 --> 01:58:23,263
..we use the X, the unknown,
until we get back to our country.

1942
01:58:23,354 --> 01:58:26,551
l see. Thank you. Er, Dr Payson?

1943
01:58:26,874 --> 01:58:29,468
Mr X is a... He's a demagogue.

1944
01:58:29,554 --> 01:58:32,352
He has no place to go, so he exaggerates.

1945
01:58:32,434 --> 01:58:34,948
He's a disservice
to every good, law-abiding,...

1946
01:58:35,034 --> 01:58:37,423
..churchgoing American Negro
in the country.

1947
01:58:37,514 --> 01:58:39,391
- (scattered applause)
- Mr Malcolm X,...

1948
01:58:41,474 --> 01:58:46,423
..why do you teach black supremacy?
Why... why do you teach hate?

1949
01:58:46,634 --> 01:58:51,230
Well, for the white man
to ask the black man...

1950
01:58:51,394 --> 01:58:53,385
..why he hates him,..

1951
01:58:53,634 --> 01:58:55,994
..is like the wolf asking the sheep,...

1952
01:58:55,994 --> 01:58:58,667
..or the rapist asking the raped:
''Do you hate me?''

1953
01:58:58,754 --> 01:59:02,269
The white man is in no moral position
to accuse the black man of anything.

1954
01:59:02,354 --> 01:59:04,310
This is a bIack man asking the question.

1955
01:59:04,394 --> 01:59:08,512
What wouIdyou caII an educated Negro
with a BA, or an MA, or a BS or a PhD?

1956
01:59:08,594 --> 01:59:12,030
l'll tell you. You call him a nigger. That's
what the white man calls him, a nigger.

1957
01:59:12,114 --> 01:59:14,548
Now, you have to understand
this type of thinking,...

1958
01:59:14,634 --> 01:59:18,627
..and to understand this type of man,
you must understand that historically,...

1959
01:59:18,714 --> 01:59:21,706
..there were two types of slaves:
the house Negro and the field Negro.

1960
01:59:21,794 --> 01:59:24,786
The house Negro lived in the house,
next to his master,...

1961
01:59:24,874 --> 01:59:27,468
..in the big house,
either in the basement or up in the attic.

1962
01:59:27,554 --> 01:59:30,352
He'd dress pretty good, he ate
pretty good, what the master left him.

1963
01:59:30,434 --> 01:59:31,947
He Ioved his master.

1964
01:59:32,034 --> 01:59:35,344
l'd say he loved his master
better than the master loved himself.

1965
01:59:35,434 --> 01:59:37,390
lf the master said
''We got a nice house here'',...

1966
01:59:37,474 --> 01:59:39,544
..he'd say
''Yeah, boss, we got a nice house here.''

1967
01:59:39,634 --> 01:59:43,946
Master's house is on fire, the house Negro
would be running to put the blaze out.

1968
01:59:44,034 --> 01:59:47,504
lf the master got sick, he'd say
''What's the matter, boss? We sick?''

1969
01:59:47,634 --> 01:59:50,307
''We sick.'' You see,
this is the thinking of the house Negro.

1970
01:59:50,394 --> 01:59:52,394
Now, if another slave
came up to him and said...

1971
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:55,147
..''Let's run away, let's separate,
let's get away from this cruel master,''....

1972
01:59:55,234 --> 01:59:57,953
..he said ''Why?
What's better than what we got here?''

1973
01:59:58,034 --> 02:00:00,502
''Run away? l'm not going anywhere!''
This is the house Negro.

1974
02:00:00,594 --> 02:00:02,425
We called 'em the house nigger.

1975
02:00:02,514 --> 02:00:06,553
And that's what we caII 'em today.
We stiII got a Iot ofhouse niggers.

1976
02:00:06,634 --> 02:00:08,545
Dear Holy Apostle,...

1977
02:00:10,394 --> 02:00:14,592
..the ministers think
Malcolm is getting too much press.

1978
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:17,234
They think he thinks
he is the Nation of lslam.

1979
02:00:19,034 --> 02:00:22,071
That he has aspirations to lead the Nation.

1980
02:00:22,594 --> 02:00:24,903
You made Malcolm the man he is.

1981
02:00:24,994 --> 02:00:27,030
You lifted him out of the darkness.

1982
02:00:27,114 --> 02:00:29,150
You...

1983
02:00:30,474 --> 02:00:36,549
You go and tell the brothers
that what the Brother Minister is doing,...

1984
02:00:36,634 --> 02:00:37,834
..has done,...

1985
02:00:37,834 --> 02:00:41,224
..has been of great benefit to the Nation.

1986
02:00:41,514 --> 02:00:44,153
And you tell them that I say so.

1987
02:00:44,234 --> 02:00:46,873
The ministers think
he is of great benefit to himself.

1988
02:00:50,954 --> 02:00:54,071
(shouting)

1989
02:00:54,154 --> 02:00:57,066
- Do you have any white friends?
- One question at a time.

1990
02:00:57,154 --> 02:01:00,430
- Did you say white people are devils, sir?
- Yes, l've said white people are devils.

1991
02:01:00,514 --> 02:01:04,268
- Should all blacks be armed, sir?
- Well, one of your most famous men said:

1992
02:01:04,354 --> 02:01:08,142
..''Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition.'' That's the way you think.

1993
02:01:08,234 --> 02:01:10,668
Malcolm, do you think your cause
will be successful?

1994
02:01:10,754 --> 02:01:12,073
l sincerely hope so.

1995
02:01:12,154 --> 02:01:14,714
- Do you advocate violence?
- No, sir.

1996
02:01:14,794 --> 02:01:16,750
Has there been a white man
who's helped your people in history?

1997
02:01:16,834 --> 02:01:19,632
Has there been a white man
that's helped my people in history?

1998
02:01:19,714 --> 02:01:22,228
- That's correct, sir.
- l don't understand the question.

1999
02:01:22,314 --> 02:01:24,032
You preach anti-white,
anti-Christian science.

2000
02:01:24,114 --> 02:01:27,743
- Are you saying you're anti-white?
- No, you're saying l'm anti-white.

2001
02:01:27,834 --> 02:01:29,028
Are all white people devils?

2002
02:01:29,114 --> 02:01:31,389
- Do you only educate young black men?
- Well, we gotta move out.

2003
02:01:31,474 --> 02:01:34,944
- We've got a plane to catch.
- (reporters shout)

2004
02:01:35,754 --> 02:01:37,745
Excuse me. Mr X? Um...

2005
02:01:38,314 --> 02:01:40,384
Hi, l... l've read some of your speeches,...

2006
02:01:40,474 --> 02:01:43,591
..and l honestly believe
that a lot of what you have to say is true,...

2007
02:01:43,674 --> 02:01:47,144
..and, and l'm a good person
in spite of what my ancestors did,...

2008
02:01:47,234 --> 02:01:49,354
..and l just... l wanted to ask you,...

2009
02:01:49,354 --> 02:01:52,391
..what can a white person like myself
who isn't prejudiced,...

2010
02:01:52,474 --> 02:01:55,830
..what can l do to help you
and further your cause?

2011
02:01:56,034 --> 02:01:57,990
Nothing.

2012
02:02:04,274 --> 02:02:09,348
My high schooI was a bIack ghetto
in Roxbury, right here in Boston.

2013
02:02:09,674 --> 02:02:13,144
I got my coIIege education on the streets
ofHarIem, in New York City.

2014
02:02:13,914 --> 02:02:18,305
l took my Master's degree in prison,
over the course of six and a half years.

2015
02:02:18,554 --> 02:02:23,230
ln fact, my old burglary hang-out
was just outside this campus.

2016
02:02:24,194 --> 02:02:26,424
l lived like an animal.

2017
02:02:26,554 --> 02:02:29,352
l stole. l used drugs.

2018
02:02:30,754 --> 02:02:33,114
l smoked reefers. Cocaine.

2019
02:02:33,114 --> 02:02:38,234
l committed adultery. Had it not been
for The Honourable Elijah Muhammad,...

2020
02:02:38,314 --> 02:02:40,953
..l'd have surely been
in an insane asylum, or dead.

2021
02:02:41,314 --> 02:02:43,953
Or possibly even
the murderer of one of you.

2022
02:02:44,034 --> 02:02:48,346
So what is Mr Muhammad trying to do?
He's trying to get us on God's side,...

2023
02:02:48,434 --> 02:02:51,790
..so that God will be on our side
and help us fight our battles.

2024
02:02:51,874 --> 02:02:54,866
When the Negro, the so-called Negro
in America gets on God's side,...

2025
02:02:54,954 --> 02:02:57,548
..and listens to the teachings
of The Honourable Elijah Muhammad,...

2026
02:02:57,634 --> 02:03:01,149
..he'll want to get off of drugs.
He'll want to get away from a life of crime.

2027
02:03:01,234 --> 02:03:03,623
He'll want to get away from
committing adultery and fornication.

2028
02:03:03,714 --> 02:03:06,672
Then he would want to get off the welfare.
He would want to get a job,...

2029
02:03:06,754 --> 02:03:10,224
..earn a living and take care of
his family, and they would respect him.

2030
02:03:10,314 --> 02:03:12,874
His son will say
''l'm proud that that's my father.''

2031
02:03:12,954 --> 02:03:15,787
His wife will say
''l'm proud that that's my husband.''

2032
02:03:15,874 --> 02:03:19,310
''Father'' only means
that you're taking care of your children.

2033
02:03:19,394 --> 02:03:20,463
That's what it is to be a father.

2034
02:03:20,554 --> 02:03:25,025
''Father'' doesn't mean that you're having
some babies. Anybody can have a baby.

2035
02:03:25,114 --> 02:03:29,949
Anybody can go out and get a woman, but
not anybody can take care of that woman.

2036
02:03:30,034 --> 02:03:32,753
There's another word for it.
lt's called responsibility.

2037
02:03:33,274 --> 02:03:37,586
lf the so-called Negro in America
was truly an American citizen,...

2038
02:03:37,674 --> 02:03:39,710
..we wouldn't have a racial problem.

2039
02:03:39,794 --> 02:03:42,786
lf the Emancipation Proclamation was
true, we wouldn't have a race problem.

2040
02:03:42,874 --> 02:03:47,072
lf the 1 3th, 14th and 1 5th Amendments
to the Constitution were authentic,...

2041
02:03:47,154 --> 02:03:48,587
..we wouldn't have a race problem.

2042
02:03:48,674 --> 02:03:50,904
lf the Supreme Court desegregation
decision were authentic,...

2043
02:03:50,994 --> 02:03:53,030
..we would not have a race problem!

2044
02:03:53,754 --> 02:03:56,712
But you have to see
that all of this is hypocrisy!

2045
02:03:56,794 --> 02:03:59,388
These Negro leaders are running around
telling the white man...

2046
02:03:59,474 --> 02:04:02,432
..that everything is all right,
that we got everything under control,...

2047
02:04:02,514 --> 02:04:05,028
..that everything The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad teaches is wrong.

2048
02:04:05,114 --> 02:04:08,072
But l'm telling you, Mr Muhammad said
these things were gonna come to pass,...

2049
02:04:08,154 --> 02:04:10,622
..and now these things
are starting to come to pass.

2050
02:04:10,714 --> 02:04:13,308
(loud cheering)

2051
02:04:13,394 --> 02:04:15,908
Now, these same Negro leaders,...

2052
02:04:15,994 --> 02:04:20,943
..who are running around talking about
there's about to be a racial explosion...

2053
02:04:21,994 --> 02:04:25,384
(chuckles)
Yes, there's gonna be a racial explosion.

2054
02:04:25,474 --> 02:04:29,911
And a racial explosion is more dangerous
than an atomic explosion!

2055
02:04:29,994 --> 02:04:32,144
(shouting and applause)

2056
02:04:32,234 --> 02:04:36,307
There's going to be an explosion
because black people are dissatisfied.

2057
02:04:36,394 --> 02:04:38,703
They're dissatisfied
not only with the white man,...

2058
02:04:38,794 --> 02:04:40,830
..but with these
Uncle Tom Negro leaders...

2059
02:04:40,914 --> 02:04:43,382
..that are trying to pose
as spokesmen for you and l!

2060
02:04:43,474 --> 02:04:45,510
(wild cheering)

2061
02:04:45,594 --> 02:04:47,949
Just like you have a powder keg,...

2062
02:04:48,034 --> 02:04:50,912
..when you have a powder keg
and there's too many sparks around it,...

2063
02:04:50,994 --> 02:04:52,950
..the thing's going to explode.

2064
02:04:53,034 --> 02:04:56,344
And if the thing that's going to explode
is sitting inside the house,...

2065
02:04:56,434 --> 02:04:59,392
..and if it explodes,
then the house is going to be destroyed.

2066
02:04:59,474 --> 02:05:02,432
l said, the house is going to be destroyed!

2067
02:05:02,514 --> 02:05:05,154
So The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is teaching you and l,...

2068
02:05:05,154 --> 02:05:08,942
..and trying to teII the white man
to get this powder keg out of his house!

2069
02:05:09,034 --> 02:05:11,502
Let the black man
separate from his house!

2070
02:05:11,594 --> 02:05:13,630
Let the black man have his own house!

2071
02:05:13,714 --> 02:05:16,467
Let the black man have his own land,
and his own property!

2072
02:05:16,554 --> 02:05:19,227
(wild cheering)

2073
02:05:19,314 --> 02:05:22,351
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is trying to tell the white man...

2074
02:05:22,434 --> 02:05:26,029
..that this thing, this explosion,
is gonna bring down his house.

2075
02:05:26,114 --> 02:05:28,753
This is what he's trying to tell him,
and more importantly,...

2076
02:05:28,834 --> 02:05:31,587
..he's trying to tell 'em
that if he doesn't do something about it,...

2077
02:05:31,674 --> 02:05:33,630
- Uh-huh!
- ..if he doesn't do something about it...

2078
02:05:33,714 --> 02:05:35,386
..it's gonna explode any day now.

2079
02:05:35,474 --> 02:05:36,748
Oh, yes, it is.

2080
02:05:36,834 --> 02:05:39,587
l'm just here to tell you
and l'm gonna make it very short.

2081
02:05:39,674 --> 02:05:41,153
Preach, Brother! Preach on!

2082
02:05:41,234 --> 02:05:44,749
l'm here to tell you about the Honourable
Elijah Muhammad's greatest greatness.

2083
02:05:44,834 --> 02:05:49,146
His greatest greatness is that he has
the only solution for peace in this country.

2084
02:05:49,234 --> 02:05:52,988

lt's the only solution for the white man.

2087
02:05:59,074 --> 02:06:01,429
Complete separation...

2088
02:06:01,634 --> 02:06:04,910
..between the black race
and the white race.

2089

(cheering)

2090

2101
02:06:54,354 --> 02:06:56,390
Brother Malcolm!

2102
02:06:56,874 --> 02:06:58,944
Yes. Yes. Hold on.

2103
02:07:00,314 --> 02:07:03,431
Yes, sir. lt's all right.
My brother, how you doin'?

2104
02:07:03,514 --> 02:07:05,584
- Can l ask you something?
- Yes, anything.

2105
02:07:05,674 --> 02:07:07,744
Are you Elijah's... pimp?

2106
02:07:07,834 --> 02:07:11,270
- (woman) He should be kiIIed...
- Wait, hold it. Hold on. Hold on.

2107
02:07:11,354 --> 02:07:15,029
- What are you saying, brother?
- (whispers) ''His greatest greatness.''

2108
02:07:15,114 --> 02:07:17,628
Just say what you're saying.

2109
02:07:18,114 --> 02:07:21,948
lf you don't know, man,
l feel the sorriest for you.

2110
02:07:22,034 --> 02:07:25,868
(chuckling) Oh, come on, brother. Wait.
Look, let me tell you something...

2111
02:07:25,954 --> 02:07:28,593
- No, let me tell you...
- Haul him out! Get him out of here!

2112
02:07:28,674 --> 02:07:30,710
Stop! You gotta get out!

2113
02:07:30,794 --> 02:07:32,910
Get out before it's too late!

2114
02:07:32,994 --> 02:07:35,462
- Don't, Malcolm! Get out!
- Disrespectin' the black man! Get him out!

2115
02:07:35,554 --> 02:07:38,591
- lt's all right. lt's all right!
- Get out, Malcolm!

2116
02:07:38,674 --> 02:07:40,710
- Sir?
- You all right, Brother Malcolm?

2117
02:07:40,794 --> 02:07:44,912
He's just hungry for knowledge, that's all.
Yeah, that brother's starving.

2118
02:07:44,994 --> 02:07:48,384
- Yes, sir.
- So am l. Let's get something to eat.

2119
02:07:48,474 --> 02:07:49,589
(chuckles)

2120
02:07:50,034 --> 02:07:52,832
- All right. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- OK. Night-night, Daddy.

2121
02:07:52,914 --> 02:07:54,950
Night-night.

2122
02:08:05,994 --> 02:08:07,950
(groans) Oh...

2123
02:08:08,354 --> 02:08:10,788
Long night. (sighs)

2124
02:08:12,434 --> 02:08:14,948
(chuckles) Oh, yeah.

2125
02:08:15,914 --> 02:08:17,870
What you lookin' at?

2126
02:08:18,114 --> 02:08:20,423
- You.
- Why are you lookin' at me like that?

2127
02:08:20,514 --> 02:08:21,833
Because you're in trouble.

2128
02:08:22,794 --> 02:08:24,944
How do you know that?

2129
02:08:25,034 --> 02:08:27,034
Oh, dear heart.

2130
02:08:27,034 --> 02:08:28,990
Because l know you.

2131
02:08:29,194 --> 02:08:31,503
Well, if you know me,...

2132
02:08:32,274 --> 02:08:35,311
..you know that l don't like to bring
my troubles into my house.

2133
02:08:35,394 --> 02:08:38,033
Mm? Mm. You know that also.

2134
02:08:41,034 --> 02:08:44,344
- Yes, l do.
- OK.

2135
02:08:44,434 --> 02:08:48,188
But l'm not made of glass,
and l won't break.

2136
02:08:55,794 --> 02:08:58,354
Look, Betty, l just want peace.

2137
02:08:59,314 --> 02:09:03,626
l want to sit here with you,
l want to... be still.

2138
02:09:03,714 --> 02:09:05,591
l want peace in my house.

2139
02:09:09,314 --> 02:09:12,067
- Have we ever had a fight?
- Never.

2140
02:09:12,154 --> 02:09:15,510
- Argument?
- Never had one, no.

2141
02:09:16,994 --> 02:09:19,349
We're gonna have one,...

2142
02:09:19,434 --> 02:09:21,709
..right now, if you don't talk about it.

2143
02:09:21,794 --> 02:09:23,750
- Talk about what, Betty?
- The talk's everywhere.

2144
02:09:23,834 --> 02:09:26,906
There's always talk
and there's always gonna be talk.

2145
02:09:26,994 --> 02:09:30,145
Aren't they talkin' now
about me trying to take over the Nation?

2146
02:09:30,234 --> 02:09:34,750
Aren't they talkin' about how we're...
gettin' rich off the Nation of lslam(?)

2147
02:09:34,834 --> 02:09:36,586
We can talk about that, too.

2148
02:09:36,674 --> 02:09:40,110
- Well, let's talk about it.
- lt's not just talk any more.

2149
02:09:40,674 --> 02:09:43,825
''UPl: Elijah Muhammad,...

2150
02:09:43,914 --> 02:09:46,872
..67-year-old leader
of the black Muslim movement,...

2151
02:09:46,954 --> 02:09:50,947
..today faced paternity suits
from two former secretaries,...

2152
02:09:51,034 --> 02:09:55,789
- These are slanders, lies.
- ..he fathered their four children.''

2153
02:09:55,874 --> 02:09:58,752
Don't you realise
this is the devil's newspaper?

2154
02:09:58,834 --> 02:10:01,109
He's trying to divide us.

2155
02:10:01,194 --> 02:10:06,143
Don't you see that? Divide and conquer.
He's trying to bring down our leader.

2156
02:10:08,554 --> 02:10:10,545
''Both women,...

2157
02:10:10,634 --> 02:10:13,353
..in their twenties, charged that...

2158
02:10:13,434 --> 02:10:16,073
- ..they had intimacies with...
- lntimacies with Mr Muhammad.

2159
02:10:24,954 --> 02:10:28,708
You think l'm not aware
of these accusations, Betty?

2160
02:10:28,914 --> 02:10:32,873
Huh? You think l'm not aware
of these vicious lies?

2161
02:10:33,714 --> 02:10:36,592
Brother Baines and l
were talking about this very thing today.

2162
02:10:36,674 --> 02:10:39,188
Baines? ls he your friend?

2163
02:10:39,274 --> 02:10:42,664
- What's the matter with you.
- Nothing. What's the matter with you?

2164
02:10:42,754 --> 02:10:46,303
Wake up! Are you so committed
that you've blinded yourself?

2165
02:10:46,394 --> 02:10:49,352
You so dedicated you can't face the truth?

2166
02:10:49,434 --> 02:10:53,552
Baines? He's the editor of the newspaper
that you established.

2167
02:10:53,634 --> 02:10:58,583
Ask him why your name hasn't appeared
in Muhammad Speaks in over a year!

2168
02:10:58,674 --> 02:11:01,754
l am not interested in personal publicity.

2169
02:11:01,754 --> 02:11:05,713
- Not one single sentence in your own!
- Our people know what l'm doing.

2170
02:11:05,794 --> 02:11:08,103
But do you know what Baines is doing?

2171
02:11:08,194 --> 02:11:10,788
What is this ''Baines, Baines, Baines''?

2172
02:11:10,874 --> 02:11:13,229
Everyone can see this but you! Oh...

2173
02:11:14,274 --> 02:11:17,471
Baines is the one who saved my life...

2174
02:11:17,714 --> 02:11:20,069
..when l was crawling around
like an animal.

2175
02:11:20,154 --> 02:11:22,907
He brought me
to The Honourable Elijah Muhammad!

2176
02:11:22,994 --> 02:11:24,950
- Yes! A long time ago!
- And The Honourable Elijah Muhammad...

2177
02:11:25,034 --> 02:11:27,594
- A long time ago!
- ..brought me back from the dead!

2178
02:11:27,674 --> 02:11:32,350
- You've repaid them over and over!
- Don't you raise your voice in my house!

2179
02:11:34,554 --> 02:11:40,470
Ask them. Ask them why they have new
cars and houses full of furniture. Hm?

2180
02:11:40,554 --> 02:11:43,466
ls this what it's about, Betty? Do you want
some new furniture? Do you want cars?

2181
02:11:43,554 --> 02:11:47,513
What do we have?
What do we have, Malcolm?

2182
02:11:47,594 --> 02:11:50,108
Broken-down jalopy,...

2183
02:11:50,194 --> 02:11:52,662
..the clothes on our backs. Hm?

2184
02:11:52,754 --> 02:11:57,111
- So l'll get you some new clothes.
- We don't even own our own home.

2185
02:11:57,194 --> 02:12:01,585
What about our children? What about me?
You don't even own life insurance.

2186
02:12:01,674 --> 02:12:05,826
Look, Betty, the Nation of lslam
will provide if anything happens to me.

2187
02:12:05,914 --> 02:12:07,870
Will they?

2188
02:12:07,954 --> 02:12:09,990
Are you sure?

2189
02:12:10,714 --> 02:12:12,750
Are you sure?

2190
02:12:12,954 --> 02:12:15,070
Are you sure?

2191
02:12:15,914 --> 02:12:18,030
Or are you blind?

2192
02:12:20,834 --> 02:12:22,984
All right.

2193
02:12:23,074 --> 02:12:25,030
(drawer slams shut)

2194
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:27,026
Um,...

2195
02:12:27,354 --> 02:12:29,914
..l've got work to do, so...

2196
02:12:30,114 --> 02:12:32,628
There's always work to do.

2197
02:12:32,714 --> 02:12:34,750
- Sweetheart, you got to help me.
- l'm trying.

2198
02:12:34,834 --> 02:12:38,543
l'm raisin' our children almost by myself.
You're runnin' all over the country...

2199
02:12:38,634 --> 02:12:40,864
Do you want me to stay home?

2200
02:12:40,954 --> 02:12:43,422
You don't know how many times
they ask me ''Where's my daddy?''

2201
02:12:43,514 --> 02:12:47,427
Do you want me to cook the food?
Make the beds and do everything?

2202
02:12:47,514 --> 02:12:49,232
- These people need me.
- We need you. We need you!

2203
02:12:49,314 --> 02:12:51,270
Well, l need you, too!
But what do you want me to do?

2204
02:12:51,354 --> 02:12:54,903
- Tell me! What do you want me to do?
- Open your eyes.

2205
02:12:54,994 --> 02:12:57,747
You can face death 24 hours a day,...

2206
02:12:57,834 --> 02:13:01,986
..but the possibility of betrayal
never enters your head.

2207
02:13:04,634 --> 02:13:06,989
Open your eyes.

2208
02:13:41,434 --> 02:13:44,187
- As salaam alaikum, Brother Minister.
- Wa-alaikum salaam, sister.

2209
02:13:44,274 --> 02:13:46,344
Her name's Eva Marie.

2210
02:13:46,434 --> 02:13:48,743
And she's two years old.

2211
02:13:49,154 --> 02:13:52,908
Brother Minister,
l didn't do anything wrong.

2212
02:13:53,274 --> 02:13:56,425
l didn't do anything to be put in isolation.

2213
02:13:57,354 --> 02:13:59,390
l believed in him.

2214
02:14:00,314 --> 02:14:03,670
l believed in The Honourable
Elijah Muhammad.

2215
02:14:04,794 --> 02:14:06,750
Believe in Allah.

2216
02:14:08,034 --> 02:14:09,990
(strains)

2217
02:14:11,354 --> 02:14:15,745
This is Saudi, she's two.
You have Lisha. She's three.

2218
02:14:15,834 --> 02:14:19,274
From theirmouths, I heard theirstories
ofwho had fathered their chiIdren,....

2219
02:14:19,274 --> 02:14:21,834
The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
is the father of my children.

2220
02:14:21,914 --> 02:14:25,111
..and that The HonourabIe EIijah
Muhammad had toId them I was his best,..

2221
02:14:25,194 --> 02:14:29,107
He often spoke of you. He loves you,
like you were his own son.

2222
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:33,233
..the greatest minister that he everhad,
but that someday I wouId Ieave him,...

2223
02:14:33,314 --> 02:14:35,703
..and turn against him,
and so I was dangerous.

2224
02:14:35,794 --> 02:14:38,308
WhiIe praising me to my face,...

2225
02:14:38,394 --> 02:14:40,350
And he said that about me?

2226
02:14:40,434 --> 02:14:42,470
..he was tearing me apart behind my back.

2227
02:14:42,554 --> 02:14:44,784
- You're absolutely sure about all this?
- Yes, l am, Brother Minister.

2228
02:14:44,874 --> 02:14:48,025
All l want is support
for my three children,...

2229
02:14:48,114 --> 02:14:53,142
..that The Honourable Elijah Muhammad
provide for them. That's all l want.

2230
02:14:55,274 --> 02:14:57,549
Allah will provide.

2231
02:14:59,794 --> 02:15:01,546
For all of us.

2232
02:15:02,034 --> 02:15:03,786
What are you talkin' about, ''blackout''?

2233
02:15:03,874 --> 02:15:07,234
Perhaps some of the brothers
are a little jealous.

2234
02:15:07,234 --> 02:15:11,864
Maybe they think you've been gettin'
too much press. lt's nothing. Forget it.

2235
02:15:11,954 --> 02:15:14,787
Now, about our coming up
in the world a little.

2236
02:15:14,874 --> 02:15:17,547
The Nation's grown, we've grown with it.

2237
02:15:18,474 --> 02:15:20,624
You know our people.

2238
02:15:21,354 --> 02:15:24,312
They want their leaders to be prosperous.

2239
02:15:24,394 --> 02:15:26,385
One hand washes the other.

2240
02:15:27,034 --> 02:15:30,788
''l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustle.''

2241
02:15:32,314 --> 02:15:34,430
Remember, Brother Baines?
That's what you told me in prison.

2242
02:15:34,514 --> 02:15:38,302
''l'm telling you God's words,
not no hustIe.''

2243
02:15:40,274 --> 02:15:42,230
Brother Malcolm,...

2244
02:15:43,154 --> 02:15:45,714
..what do you want? A new car?

2245
02:15:47,154 --> 02:15:49,190
A new house?

2246
02:15:49,834 --> 02:15:50,949
lt's the money, isn't it?

2247
02:15:56,354 --> 02:15:59,869
How do we tell the whole world
that we're moral leaders,...

2248
02:16:00,394 --> 02:16:05,263
..because we follow the personal example
of The Honourable Elijah Muhammad?

2249
02:16:05,394 --> 02:16:09,546
Elijah Muhammad is a human being.
And so are you.

2250
02:16:09,634 --> 02:16:12,353
- Do you know your Bible?
- Do you know yours?

2251
02:16:12,514 --> 02:16:17,668
David slept with Bathsheba,
but he is remembered for slaying Goliath.

2252
02:16:18,474 --> 02:16:23,229
Noah was accused of drunkenness,
but God gave him the ark.

2253
02:16:23,314 --> 02:16:28,024
Solomon had 700 wives, but he was
the greatest, wisest king in history.

2254
02:16:28,114 --> 02:16:31,789
Brother Baines is a two-bit hustler,
but one hand washes the other.

2255
02:16:31,874 --> 02:16:34,786
The deeds of a great man
far outweigh his weaknesses.

2256
02:16:34,874 --> 02:16:37,183
Who needs the nutmeg now, brother?

2257
02:16:37,274 --> 02:16:41,028
- Baines, l'm not gonna lie...
- Be careful, Malcolm.

2258
02:16:41,634 --> 02:16:43,147
l warn you.

2259
02:16:43,234 --> 02:16:45,190
You be careful.

2260
02:17:02,594 --> 02:17:04,550
(door opens)

2261
02:17:06,314 --> 02:17:08,270
(door closes)

2262
02:17:13,354 --> 02:17:15,504
l'm not surprised.

2263
02:17:18,394 --> 02:17:23,024
You have a very good understanding
of prophecy, of spiritual matters.

2264
02:17:23,114 --> 02:17:25,264
l'm not surprised.

2265
02:17:25,794 --> 02:17:28,228
l have built this Nation,...

2266
02:17:28,474 --> 02:17:31,705
..under the divine guidance of Allah.

2267
02:17:32,514 --> 02:17:36,427
He has brought me back from the dead
to lead my people.

2268
02:17:36,514 --> 02:17:38,744
After me, there will be no more.

2269
02:17:38,834 --> 02:17:40,870
No more.

2270
02:17:41,114 --> 02:17:43,947
(clock ticks)

2271
02:17:44,554 --> 02:17:46,704
l must...

2272
02:17:48,154 --> 02:17:51,271
..plant my seed in fertile soil.

2273
02:17:51,474 --> 02:17:56,423
lt is only the fulfilment of prophecy.

2274
02:17:56,514 --> 02:18:00,712
My faith had been shattered
in a way I can never fuIIy describe.

2275
02:18:00,794 --> 02:18:03,388
Every second ofmy 12 years
with MrMuhammad,...

2276
02:18:03,474 --> 02:18:05,942
..I had been ready
to Iay down my Iife forhim.

2277
02:18:06,034 --> 02:18:09,822
The thing to me
that is worse than death itseIfis betrayaI.

2278
02:18:09,914 --> 02:18:13,827
You see, I couId conceive death,
but I couIdn 't conceive betrayaI.

2279
02:18:13,914 --> 02:18:18,192
Not ofthe IoyaIty which I had given
to the Nation ofIsIam and MrMuhammad.

2280
02:18:18,274 --> 02:18:22,665
During the previous 12 years, had he
committed a crime punishabIe by death,...

2281
02:18:22,754 --> 02:18:26,793
..I wouId have said and tried to prove
that I did it, to save him,...

2282
02:18:26,874 --> 02:18:30,184
..and gIadIy gone to the eIectric chair
in MrMuhammad's pIace.

2283
02:18:32,114 --> 02:18:34,070
* Ray CharIes: Up in the mornin '

2284
02:18:34,154 --> 02:18:36,110
(footsteps)

2285
02:18:36,594 --> 02:18:38,550
* Out on thejob

2286
02:18:40,034 --> 02:18:45,347
- * (gospeI choir) Oh...
- * I work Iike the deviI formy pay...

2287
02:18:45,834 --> 02:18:47,790
What did he say?

2288
02:18:47,874 --> 02:18:53,471
* I know that the Iucky oId sun...

2289
02:18:54,354 --> 02:18:58,108
- l'm so sorry.
- No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

2290
02:18:58,314 --> 02:19:00,874
l just got a lot of work to do, that's all.

2291
02:19:04,794 --> 02:19:08,753
- How can you work?
- Well, because we have to teach.

2292
02:19:08,834 --> 02:19:13,350
We got to teach the people, we got to
teach on Solomon and Moses, David...

2293
02:19:13,434 --> 02:19:15,550
Solomon had 700 wives.

2294
02:19:15,634 --> 02:19:18,990
A man's good deeds,
they far outweigh any of his...

2295
02:19:19,074 --> 02:19:22,828
(chuckles)
My father used to say that, uh,...

2296
02:19:22,914 --> 02:19:25,872
..you can't make a rooster stop crowing
once the sun has come up.

2297
02:19:25,954 --> 02:19:28,309
Well, the sun is up.

2298
02:19:28,714 --> 02:19:32,150
* I know that Iucky oId sun

2299
02:19:34,714 --> 02:19:36,670
* Has nothin' to do

2300
02:19:41,234 --> 02:19:43,907
* But roII around heaven aII day

2301
02:19:46,874 --> 02:19:48,990
- * Oh...
- * DearLord... *

2302
02:19:49,074 --> 02:19:51,793
So what do I say
about this nationaI day ofmourning,...

2303
02:19:51,874 --> 02:19:54,149
..so-called national day of mourning?

2304
02:19:54,234 --> 02:19:56,429
l say the white man's acts of violence
should be condemned,...

2305
02:19:56,514 --> 02:19:58,664
..not only by our beliefs, but by his own.

2306
02:19:59,834 --> 02:20:02,553
The holy Koran teaches us
that those who work evil...

2307
02:20:02,634 --> 02:20:07,344
..will be condemned, or punished,
or judged, according to their works.

2308
02:20:07,434 --> 02:20:12,224
The hoIy BibIe teaches us thatyou reap
whatyou sow. This is divinejustice.

2309
02:20:12,314 --> 02:20:16,068
ln the soil of the Americas, the white man
has planted the seeds of hatred.

2310
02:20:16,154 --> 02:20:18,065
He's planted the seeds of violence.

2311
02:20:18,154 --> 02:20:20,270
He's allowed those weeds to grow up...

2312
02:20:20,354 --> 02:20:23,824
..and choke the lives out of millions
of black men and women for 400 years.

2313
02:20:23,914 --> 02:20:28,305
ln fact, the lives of lndians
in these Americas for the last 500 years.

2314
02:20:28,394 --> 02:20:29,952
And now those same weeds...

2315
02:20:30,034 --> 02:20:32,946
..have choked one of his own gardeners,
in fact, his chief gardener,...

2316
02:20:33,034 --> 02:20:36,265
..and you ask me what l say.
l only say what the Bible says.

2317
02:20:36,354 --> 02:20:38,948
l say what the Koran says.

2318
02:20:39,434 --> 02:20:41,584
l say it's justice.

2319
02:20:41,674 --> 02:20:43,630
- (cheering and applause)
- As salaam alaikum.

2320
02:20:43,714 --> 02:20:45,511
(crowd shouts)

2321
02:20:45,594 --> 02:20:48,472
Minister X, don't you even feel
a little bit of remorse,...

2322
02:20:48,554 --> 02:20:51,068
..saddened by
President Kennedy's assassination?

2323
02:20:51,154 --> 02:20:54,112
Sir, l don't think
anybody here would deny...

2324
02:20:54,194 --> 02:20:56,150
..that when you send your chickens out
in the morning from your barnyard,...

2325
02:20:56,234 --> 02:20:59,590
..the chickens will return that evening
to your barnyard, not your neighbour's.

2326
02:20:59,674 --> 02:21:03,110
This is a prime example of the devil's
chickens coming back home to roost.

2327
02:21:03,194 --> 02:21:05,034
That the chickens that he's sent out,...

2328
02:21:05,034 --> 02:21:07,025
..the violence he's perpetrated
here and abroad,...

2329
02:21:07,114 --> 02:21:08,433
..be it four children in Birmingham,...

2330
02:21:08,514 --> 02:21:10,470
..orMedgarEvers,
orLumumba overin Africa.

2331
02:21:10,554 --> 02:21:12,784
I think this same vioIence
has come back to cIaim one oftheir own.

2332
02:21:12,874 --> 02:21:14,353
Now, being an oId farm boy myseIf,...

2333
02:21:14,434 --> 02:21:16,584
..chickens coming home to roost
nevermade me sad.

2334
02:21:16,674 --> 02:21:20,144
- ln fact, it's only made me glad.
- (reporters shout)

2335
02:21:20,234 --> 02:21:23,067
(coughs)

2336
02:21:23,154 --> 02:21:26,112
(sniffs and gasps)

2337
02:21:27,634 --> 02:21:29,590
Did you...

2338
02:21:29,674 --> 02:21:31,869
..read the paper today?

2339
02:21:34,874 --> 02:21:36,910
Yes, sir, l did.

2340
02:21:39,554 --> 02:21:41,112
That...

2341
02:21:41,194 --> 02:21:44,027
..was a bad statement you made.

2342
02:21:46,474 --> 02:21:49,989
You knew from my instructions,...

2343
02:21:50,074 --> 02:21:54,989
..no Minister was to make
any statements against this man.

2344
02:21:55,074 --> 02:21:57,508
The country loved this man.

2345
02:21:57,914 --> 02:21:59,984
You have made it...

2346
02:22:00,074 --> 02:22:02,827
..hard for Muslims...

2347
02:22:03,754 --> 02:22:05,631
..(coughs) in general.

2348
02:22:05,714 --> 02:22:07,625
(coughs)

2349
02:22:07,714 --> 02:22:09,670
Yes, sir.

2350
02:22:09,754 --> 02:22:15,750
We must dissociate ourselves
from your terrible blunder.

2351
02:22:18,514 --> 02:22:20,664
l must silence you.

2352
02:22:21,314 --> 02:22:23,464
For 90 days,...

2353
02:22:24,114 --> 02:22:29,984
..you must not make
any statements to the press,...

2354
02:22:30,754 --> 02:22:34,986
..nor are you to speak at any temples.

2355
02:22:36,194 --> 02:22:38,150
Yes, sir.

2356
02:22:38,794 --> 02:22:41,627
Yes, sir. l submit 1 00 per cent.

2357
02:22:48,634 --> 02:22:51,387
(phlegmy cough)

2358
02:22:51,474 --> 02:22:55,308
(coughs painfully)

2359
02:23:03,114 --> 02:23:05,150
(coughing continues)

2360
02:23:09,834 --> 02:23:14,305
(laboured coughing)

2361
02:23:19,354 --> 02:23:21,345
(telephone rings)

2362
02:23:21,434 --> 02:23:24,790
(child babbles happily)

2363
02:23:36,714 --> 02:23:38,705
You leave us alone.

2364
02:23:39,674 --> 02:23:42,029
- Betty?
- Leave us alone. Stop calling here.

2365
02:23:42,114 --> 02:23:45,868
Who's putting you up to this?
We have children here!

2366
02:23:45,954 --> 02:23:48,104
Stop it! Stop...

2367
02:23:48,834 --> 02:23:50,790
Hello?

2368
02:23:59,274 --> 02:24:03,028
- (whispers) lt's all right. lt's OK.
- They keep calling.

2369
02:24:03,794 --> 02:24:06,308
- They keep calling...
- Shhhh.

2370
02:24:07,194 --> 02:24:09,754
(whispers) Shh. Now, just, uh,...

2371
02:24:10,874 --> 02:24:13,513
We'll take the babies, put them into bed.

2372
02:24:13,594 --> 02:24:15,630
C'mon, babies, let's go to bed now.

2373
02:24:15,714 --> 02:24:18,512
- C'mon. Come on.
- Bedtime.

2374
02:24:18,594 --> 02:24:20,550
Let's go.

2375
02:24:20,634 --> 02:24:24,183
- Good night, Mommy, good night, Daddy.
- There you go. Night-night.

2376
02:24:24,274 --> 02:24:26,310
- Good night, Sidney.
- Night-night!

2377
02:24:26,394 --> 02:24:29,431
- Come on.
- Good night.

2378
02:24:39,194 --> 02:24:42,152
Brother Minister, l have to level with you.

2379
02:24:42,594 --> 02:24:46,189
They gave me a mission.
But l couldn't do it.

2380
02:24:46,594 --> 02:24:49,666
- l love y'all.
- What kind of mission?

2381
02:24:52,394 --> 02:24:54,430
To wire your car...

2382
02:24:54,514 --> 02:24:58,393
..so it would explode
when you turned the ignition.

2383
02:24:59,714 --> 02:25:04,834
The ministers say you're spreading
untruths about Mr Muhammad.

2384
02:25:04,914 --> 02:25:09,146
The ministers say that you are
the greatest hypocrite, a... a Judas.

2385
02:25:09,474 --> 02:25:11,669
A Benedict Arnold.

2386
02:25:11,754 --> 02:25:16,384
The ministers say that
your tongue should be cut out,...

2387
02:25:16,754 --> 02:25:19,791
..and delivered
to Mr Muhammad's doorstep.

2388
02:25:20,514 --> 02:25:23,984
- And what do you say?
- l'm with you, Brother Minister.

2389
02:25:24,314 --> 02:25:27,750
- You'll be marked for death.
- Yes, sir.

2390
02:25:27,834 --> 02:25:29,313
Let me die, then.

2391
02:25:37,874 --> 02:25:39,990
(sighs)

2392
02:25:40,714 --> 02:25:44,389
Brother, l can't come between you
and your father.

2393
02:25:44,834 --> 02:25:48,622
- You're my father.
- Brother, go on home.

2394
02:25:49,154 --> 02:25:51,873
Don't come back. That's an order.

2395
02:25:58,394 --> 02:26:00,430
Yes, sir.

2396
02:26:11,874 --> 02:26:15,549
Because 1964 threatens to be
an expIosive year on the raciaI front,...

2397
02:26:15,634 --> 02:26:18,068
..l have called this press conference
this morning...

2398
02:26:18,154 --> 02:26:20,543
..in order to clarify my position
in that struggle.

2399
02:26:20,634 --> 02:26:23,910
lnternal differences within the Nation
of lslam have forced me out of it.

2400
02:26:23,994 --> 02:26:25,950
ln the past, l thought the thoughts...

2401
02:26:26,034 --> 02:26:28,468
..and l spoke the words
of The Honourable Elijah Muhammad.

2402
02:26:28,554 --> 02:26:30,146
lf you recall, everything l said,...

2403
02:26:30,234 --> 02:26:33,988
..l started off with ''The Honourable Elijah
Muhammad teaches us thus, and so.''

2404
02:26:34,074 --> 02:26:39,307
That's over. From now on, l speak my
own words and think my own thoughts.

2405
02:26:39,394 --> 02:26:41,862
Now that I have more, uh,
independence ofaction,...

2406
02:26:41,954 --> 02:26:45,424
..I intend to use a more fIexibIe approach
toward working with others...

2407
02:26:45,514 --> 02:26:47,311
..to get a soIution to this probIem.

2408
02:26:47,394 --> 02:26:48,986
l'm not out to fight other Negro leaders.

2409
02:26:49,074 --> 02:26:53,033
l have now forgotten every bad thing
that other leaders have said about me,...

2410
02:26:53,114 --> 02:26:57,232
..and l pray that they also forget the many
bad things that l have said about them.

2411
02:26:57,314 --> 02:27:01,512
We must work together. We must find
a common solution to a common problem.

2412
02:27:01,594 --> 02:27:04,233
l'm going to organise and lead
a new mosque in New York City,...

2413
02:27:04,314 --> 02:27:06,669
..known as Muslim Mosque lncorporated.

2414
02:27:06,754 --> 02:27:08,754
This gives us the religious base...

2415
02:27:08,754 --> 02:27:12,588
..and the spiritual, uh, force necessary
to rid our people of the vices...

2416
02:27:12,674 --> 02:27:15,234
...that destroy the moral fibre
of our community.

2417
02:27:15,314 --> 02:27:17,669
Our political philosophy
will be black nationalism,...

2418
02:27:17,754 --> 02:27:20,826
..which means we want to control
the politics of our community.

2419
02:27:20,914 --> 02:27:24,668
The Muslim Mosque lncorporated
will remain wide open for ideas...

2420
02:27:24,754 --> 02:27:27,143
..and financial aid from all quarters.

2421
02:27:27,234 --> 02:27:30,192
Whites can help us, but they can't join us.

2422
02:27:30,274 --> 02:27:33,869
There can be no black-white unity
until there is first some black unity.

2423
02:27:33,954 --> 02:27:35,994
We cannot think of uniting with others,...

2424
02:27:35,994 --> 02:27:38,428
..until we have first learned
to unite amongst ourselves.

2425
02:27:38,514 --> 02:27:40,744
We cannot think of being
acceptable to others...

2426
02:27:40,834 --> 02:27:43,473
..until we have first proven
acceptable to ourselves.

2427
02:27:43,554 --> 02:27:47,229
In my desire to fuIIy understand
the reIigion ofIsIam,...

2428
02:27:47,314 --> 02:27:51,068
...as practised by 750 miIIion MusIims
around the worId,...

2429
02:27:51,394 --> 02:27:55,785
..I intend to make a piIgrimage,
orhoIy, uh,journey to Mecca.

2430
02:27:55,874 --> 02:28:00,743
This piIgrimage is a reIigious requirement
or duty ofevery MusIim that is abIe,...

2431
02:28:00,834 --> 02:28:04,986
..uh, to make the piIgrimage
at Ieast once in his Iifetime.

2432
02:28:16,354 --> 02:28:18,310
(men shout)

2433
02:28:18,394 --> 02:28:20,589
- l'm Egyptian. What are you?
- American.

2434
02:28:20,674 --> 02:28:23,313
- American. What's your name?
- Malcolm. Malcolm.

2435
02:28:23,394 --> 02:28:25,350
Malcolm!

2436

(all shout in Arabic)

2437
02:28:34,794 --> 02:28:36,944
Yes, l want to get...

2438
02:28:37,034 --> 02:28:38,308
How much...?

2439
02:28:38,394 --> 02:28:40,510
- How much?
- 20 Egyptian pound.

2440
02:28:40,594 --> 02:28:42,471
- For one?
- Yes.

2441
02:28:42,554 --> 02:28:44,909
- Special price for you.
- Special price for me(!)

2442
02:28:44,994 --> 02:28:48,543
OK, thank you.
Where can l get a better price?

2443
02:28:48,634 --> 02:28:52,593
(shouting in Arabic)

2444
02:28:52,674 --> 02:28:55,472
- What's your name?
- Ah. Muhammad.

2445
02:28:55,554 --> 02:28:57,670
- Muhammad. l'm Malcolm.
- Malcolm? You Malcolm?

2446
02:28:57,754 --> 02:29:00,063
- Malcolm X. You?
- Gamaal.

2447
02:29:00,154 --> 02:29:04,625
Gamaal. All right, Gamaal. l'm from
uh, Harlem, from the United States.

2448
02:29:04,714 --> 02:29:06,352
- Harem?
- Harlem.

2449
02:29:06,434 --> 02:29:09,232
- Hareem?
- No, not ''hareem''. Har-lem.

2450
02:29:09,314 --> 02:29:12,033
- Can you take me to show me around...
- Hashish, hashish?

2451
02:29:12,114 --> 02:29:15,265
- Not hashish. Uh...
- Hashish?

2452
02:29:15,354 --> 02:29:18,664
- Uh, the Pyramids?
- Yeah! * Pyramid!*

2453
02:29:18,754 --> 02:29:21,314
- No. Pyramid. Pyramid.
- (both) * Pyramid, pyramid, pirimidimid!*

2454
02:29:21,394 --> 02:29:23,624
- No, no, no.
- One pyramid, ezay ya welad?

2455
02:29:23,714 --> 02:29:25,432
- Pyramids?
- Pyramids!

2456
02:29:25,514 --> 02:29:26,708
- Pyramids!
- You gonna take me?

2457
02:29:26,794 --> 02:29:28,193
Yes! Yes!

- Yes!

2459
02:29:30,514 --> 02:29:33,745
- Sphinx! Yeah. Right.

2476
02:30:48,834 --> 02:30:50,790
My darIing Betty,...

2477
02:30:50,874 --> 02:30:54,833
..everywhere I go, I am weIcomed
as a representative ofourpeopIe.

2478
02:30:54,914 --> 02:30:57,269
OurstruggIe is known
and respected worIdwide.

2479
02:30:57,354 --> 02:31:01,905
CoincidentaIIy, there are two white men
who foIIow me around whereverI go.

2480
02:31:02,394 --> 02:31:06,353
I wonder who they're working for.
IfI was a betting man, I'd say the CIA.

2481
02:31:06,434 --> 02:31:08,664
What's yourguess?

2482
02:31:09,234 --> 02:31:11,589
Today I arrived in Arabia.

2483
02:31:12,354 --> 02:31:15,949
''l have never witnessed
such sincere hospitality...

2484
02:31:16,034 --> 02:31:18,184
..and true brotherhood...

2485
02:31:18,274 --> 02:31:19,946
(Betty) ..as practised here,...

2486
02:31:20,034 --> 02:31:23,231
..in the ancient home ofAbraham,
Muhammad,...

2487
02:31:23,314 --> 02:31:26,670
..and the greatprophets
ofthe Scriptures.''

2488
02:31:32,754 --> 02:31:35,427
''Today, with thousands ofothers,...

2489
02:31:35,514 --> 02:31:39,792
(MaIcoIm) I procIaimed God's greatness
in the sacred city ofMecca.

2490
02:31:39,874 --> 02:31:43,230
Wearing the ihram garb, I made
my seven circuits around the Kaaba.

2491
02:31:43,314 --> 02:31:45,305
I drank from the weII ofZem Zem.

2492
02:31:45,394 --> 02:31:48,306
I prayed to AIIah from MountArafat.

2493
02:31:48,394 --> 02:31:53,866
It was the onIy time in my Iife
that I stood before the Creator ofAII...

2494
02:31:53,954 --> 02:31:56,468
..and feIt Iike a compIete human being.

2495
02:31:59,114 --> 02:32:02,470
As salaam alaikum,
wa rahmat llah wa barakatoh.

2496
02:32:03,074 --> 02:32:05,542
As salaam alaikum, wa rahmat llah.

2497
02:32:05,634 --> 02:32:12,472
(pilgrims) Salaam alaikum, wa rahmat llah.

2498
02:32:12,554 --> 02:32:16,672
Now, you may be shocked
by these words,...

2499
02:32:16,754 --> 02:32:21,464
..but I have eaten from the same pIate,
drunk from the same gIass,...

2500
02:32:21,554 --> 02:32:25,467
..andprayed to the same God with
feIIow MusIims whose eyes were bIue,...

2501
02:32:25,554 --> 02:32:27,749
..whose hair was bIond...

2502
02:32:27,834 --> 02:32:29,790
..and whose skin was the whitest ofwhite.

2503
02:32:29,874 --> 02:32:33,074
And we were aII brothers, truIy,...

2504
02:32:33,074 --> 02:32:36,623
..peopIe ofaII coIours and races
beIieving in one God, in one humanity.

2505
02:32:36,714 --> 02:32:38,591
- Wa elnamata!
- Wa elnamata!

2506
02:32:38,674 --> 02:32:40,790
- Laka wal mulk!
- Laka wal mulk!

2507
02:32:40,874 --> 02:32:44,344
- La sharik leka!
- La sharik leka!

- Lebeyk llah uma lebeyk!

2509
02:32:51,034 --> 02:32:53,707
Each hourhere in this sacred Iand...

2510
02:32:53,794 --> 02:32:57,230
..enabIes me to have a greaterspirituaI
insight into what is happening in America.

2511
02:32:57,314 --> 02:33:01,785
The American Negro can neverbe bIamed
forhis raciaI animosities,...

2512
02:33:01,874 --> 02:33:05,549
..he is onIy reacting to 400 years
ofoppression and discrimination.

2513
02:33:06,074 --> 02:33:09,510
But as racism Ieads America
up the suicidaIpath,...

2514
02:33:09,594 --> 02:33:13,269
..I do beIieve that the youngergeneration
wiII see the handwriting on the waII,...

2515
02:33:13,354 --> 02:33:16,551
..and many ofthem wiII want to turn
to the spirituaIpath ofthe truth,...

2516
02:33:16,634 --> 02:33:18,864
..the onIy way Ieft in this worId...

2517
02:33:18,954 --> 02:33:21,787
..to ward offthe disaster
that racism must sureIy Iead to.

2518
02:33:22,154 --> 02:33:26,193
Once before in prison,
the truth came and bIinded me.

2519
02:33:26,274 --> 02:33:28,868
WeII, it has happened again.

2520
02:33:29,074 --> 02:33:33,431
In the past, I have made
sweeping indictments ofaII white peopIe.

2521
02:33:33,514 --> 02:33:38,952
These generaIisations caused injuries to
some white foIks who did not deserve it.

2522
02:33:39,034 --> 02:33:43,505
''Because of the spiritual rebirth
which l was blessed to undergo...

2523
02:33:43,594 --> 02:33:47,951
..as a result of my pilgrimage
to the Holy City of Mecca,...

2524
02:33:49,794 --> 02:33:53,309
..l no longer subscribe
to sweeping indictments of one race.

2525
02:33:53,394 --> 02:33:56,864
I intend to be very carefuI...

2526
02:33:56,954 --> 02:33:58,626
..not to sentence anyone...

2527
02:33:58,714 --> 02:34:01,751
(MaIcoIm)
..who has not been proven guiIty.

2528
02:34:01,834 --> 02:34:04,223
I am not a racist,...

2529
02:34:04,314 --> 02:34:07,192
..and I do not subscribe
to any ofthe tenets ofracism.

2530
02:34:07,274 --> 02:34:11,586
In aII honesty and sincerity,
it can be stated that I wish...

2531
02:34:11,674 --> 02:34:15,144
..nothing but freedom,
justice and equaIity,...

2532
02:34:15,394 --> 02:34:20,422
..Iife, Iiberty and the pursuit ofhappiness
for aIIpeopIe.

2533
02:34:21,194 --> 02:34:24,391
Now, my first concern, ofcourse,
is with the group to which I beIong,...

2534
02:34:24,554 --> 02:34:28,547
..for we, more than any others,
are deprived ofourinaIienabIe rights.

2535
02:34:28,634 --> 02:34:32,832
But I beIieve the true practice ofIsIam
can remove the cancer ofracism...

2536
02:34:32,914 --> 02:34:36,463
..from the hearts and the souIs
ofaIIAmericans.

2537
02:34:36,554 --> 02:34:39,068
And ifI can die having brought any Iight,...

2538
02:34:39,154 --> 02:34:44,023
..having exposed any meaningfuI truth
that wiII heIp destroy this disease,...

2539
02:34:44,354 --> 02:34:48,506
..then aII the credit is due to AIIah,
the Lord ofaII the WorIds.

2540
02:34:48,594 --> 02:34:51,472
And onIy the mistakes have been mine.

2541
02:34:52,394 --> 02:34:55,113
PIease give aII my Iove to the chiIdren.

2542
02:34:55,194 --> 02:34:57,469
I Iove you dearIy.

2543
02:34:57,554 --> 02:35:00,626

2554
02:35:48,434 --> 02:35:49,423
Let's begin.

2555
02:35:49,714 --> 02:35:53,992
MaIcoIm, you said on your trip abroadyou
sensed a feeIing ofgreat brotherhood.

2556
02:35:54,074 --> 02:35:58,033
Uh, yes. When l was in Mecca,
making the pilgrimage,...

2557
02:35:58,954 --> 02:36:01,594
..the brotherhood that existed there...

2558
02:36:01,594 --> 02:36:04,267
..among aIIpeopIe, aII races,
aII IeveIs ofpeopIe...

2559
02:36:04,354 --> 02:36:06,470
..who had accepted
the reIigion ofIsIam,...

2560
02:36:08,034 --> 02:36:12,425
..what it had done, IsIam,
for those peopIe, despite their, uh,...

2561
02:36:12,514 --> 02:36:14,470
..compIexion differences,...

2562
02:36:14,554 --> 02:36:17,785
..perhaps ifpeopIe
here in America wouId try and...

2563
02:36:17,874 --> 02:36:20,183
..practise and study the religion of lslam,...

2564
02:36:20,274 --> 02:36:24,904
..it might help to erase
the plague of racism here.

2565
02:36:25,714 --> 02:36:30,265
l think Muslims over there
look at themselves as human beings,...

2566
02:36:30,354 --> 02:36:32,788
..as part of the same human family.

2567
02:36:32,874 --> 02:36:36,344
Today, my friends are black,...

2568
02:36:36,874 --> 02:36:39,388
..red, yellow, brown and white.

2569
02:36:39,474 --> 02:36:41,908
Malcolm, are you prepared to ask
the United Nations,...

2570
02:36:41,994 --> 02:36:45,782
to bring charges against the United States
for its treatment of the American Negro?

2571
02:36:45,874 --> 02:36:47,830
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
- (applause)

2572
02:36:49,674 --> 02:36:52,347
The audience will have to be quiet.

2573
02:36:52,834 --> 02:36:54,984
PIease. PIease.

2574
02:36:55,394 --> 02:36:57,988
Yes, as I stated earIier, that, um...

2575
02:36:58,834 --> 02:37:01,951
..those nations, African nations,
Latin nations, Asian nations,...

2576
02:37:02,034 --> 02:37:04,946
..are... are very hypocriticaI
when they stand up in the UN...

2577
02:37:05,034 --> 02:37:08,390
..and denounce the racism practised
in South Africa, and at the same time,...

2578
02:37:08,474 --> 02:37:13,946
..say absolutely nothing about
the practice of racism in America.

2579
02:37:14,034 --> 02:37:16,343
Now, l wouldn't be a man if l didn't do so.

2580
02:37:16,434 --> 02:37:18,584
- l would not be a man.
- Are you prepared now...

2581
02:37:18,674 --> 02:37:22,269
..to work with some of the leaders
of other civil rights organisations?

2582
02:37:22,354 --> 02:37:26,142
Yes, we're prepared to work with
any groups, leaders, organisations,...

2583
02:37:26,234 --> 02:37:30,910
..as long as they're genuinely interested
in, uh, results. Positive results.

2584
02:37:30,994 --> 02:37:33,667
Does your new beard
have any religious significance?

2585
02:37:33,754 --> 02:37:36,905
- (laughter)
- Uh, no. Not particularly.

2586
02:37:36,994 --> 02:37:40,031
But I think that, uh,
as bIack peopIe in America...

2587
02:37:40,114 --> 02:37:44,232
..strive to throw offthe shackIes
of... ofmentaI coIoniaIism,...

2588
02:37:44,314 --> 02:37:46,350
..they wiII aIso refIect their desire...

2589
02:37:46,434 --> 02:37:49,471
..to throw offthe shackIes
of, uh, cuIturaI coIoniaIism.

2590
02:37:49,554 --> 02:37:52,626
l believe that a mental and cultural
migration back to Africa,...

2591
02:37:52,714 --> 02:37:54,784
..not necessarily a physical migration,...

2592
02:37:54,874 --> 02:37:59,072
..not at this point, but a mental
and cultural migration back to Africa...

2593
02:37:59,154 --> 02:38:03,386
..which only means that we reaffirm
our bond with our brothers over there,...

2594
02:38:03,474 --> 02:38:07,467
..would help to strengthen us here
in America, black people in America,...

2595
02:38:07,554 --> 02:38:11,593
..not only spiritually,
but as well as giving us the incentive...

2596
02:38:11,674 --> 02:38:14,108
..to solve some of our problems
here at, uh, at home.

2597
02:38:14,194 --> 02:38:16,230
One of your more controversial remarks

2598
02:38:16,314 --> 02:38:19,829
was a call for black people
to get rifles and form rifle clubs.

2599
02:38:19,914 --> 02:38:21,825
Do you still favour that for self-defence?

2600
02:38:21,914 --> 02:38:24,269
Well, l don't see why that's controversial.

2601
02:38:24,354 --> 02:38:29,269
l think that if white people find themselves
the victims of the same kind of violence...

2602
02:38:29,354 --> 02:38:31,993
..that black people found themselves
victims of here in America,...

2603
02:38:32,074 --> 02:38:35,384
..and if the government was unable
or unwilling to do anything about it,...

2604
02:38:35,474 --> 02:38:38,466
..l think that it would be intelligence
on their part to defend themselves.

2605
02:38:38,554 --> 02:38:41,751
- What about the guns, Malcolm?
- (flashbulb pops)

2606
02:38:41,834 --> 02:38:45,588
When you tell your people
to stop being violent against my people,...

2607
02:38:45,674 --> 02:38:47,744
..l'll tell my people to put away their guns.

2608
02:38:47,834 --> 02:38:50,746
- So then you are still an extremist...
- Get your hand outta my pocket!

2609
02:38:57,034 --> 02:38:58,911
Next question.

2610
02:39:01,874 --> 02:39:04,342
(telephone rings)

2611
02:39:06,474 --> 02:39:07,793
(telephone rings)

2612
02:39:18,114 --> 02:39:20,787
MaIcoIm, you one dead red nigger.

2613
02:39:20,874 --> 02:39:25,231
Your days on this earth
are numbered,... brother.

2614
02:39:37,274 --> 02:39:39,230
Come to bed.

2615
02:39:39,994 --> 02:39:42,224
Get some rest.

2616
02:39:45,514 --> 02:39:47,470
- Mm...
- l'm sorry, Betty.

2617
02:39:48,994 --> 02:39:50,950
Sorry for what?

2618
02:39:51,034 --> 02:39:53,912
- Well, l haven't been the best husband...
- Shh.

2619
02:39:53,994 --> 02:39:57,191
Or the best father. A family shouldn't be
separated like ours has been.

2620
02:39:57,274 --> 02:40:02,826
And l promise you l'll never make another
long trip without you and the children.

2621
02:40:04,394 --> 02:40:06,954
l miss you and the girls.

2622
02:40:10,914 --> 02:40:13,667
We'll all be together, l promise you that.

2623
02:40:14,034 --> 02:40:15,990
Dear heart.

2624
02:40:18,394 --> 02:40:20,544
l love you.

2625
02:40:23,154 --> 02:40:25,110
Thank you.

2626
02:40:26,714 --> 02:40:28,670
(Betty chuckles)

2627
02:40:32,914 --> 02:40:35,223
Get some sleep.

2628
02:40:39,314 --> 02:40:42,465
We had the best organisation
a black man will ever see.

2629
02:40:43,114 --> 02:40:45,070
Niggers ruined it.

2630
02:40:56,954 --> 02:40:59,104
(baby coos)

2631
02:41:06,794 --> 02:41:08,750
(barrel clicks)

2632
02:41:11,314 --> 02:41:13,908
- (whispers) Betty.
- Mm?

2633
02:41:13,994 --> 02:41:16,269
Betty. Wake up.

2634
02:41:20,274 --> 02:41:23,152
- My babies!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Girls, come on!

2635
02:41:23,234 --> 02:41:25,828
- Out, out, out! Outside! Out, out, out! Go!
- (children shriek)

2636
02:41:25,914 --> 02:41:27,711
Out!

2637
02:41:27,794 --> 02:41:30,183
Go! Go! Run! Run, run, run, run!

2638
02:41:30,274 --> 02:41:32,230
Come on! Run!

2639
02:41:32,594 --> 02:41:35,825
- Somebody call the fire department!
- (shrieks) Help! Help!

2640
02:41:35,914 --> 02:41:36,869
Come on!

2641
02:41:36,954 --> 02:41:40,947
Call the fire department, please!
Somebody call the fire department!

2642
02:41:41,034 --> 02:41:42,353
l'm a man!

2643
02:41:42,434 --> 02:41:44,743
Evidently, the, uh,...

2644
02:41:44,834 --> 02:41:47,587
..some type of bomb,
Molotov cocktail bomb...

2645
02:41:47,674 --> 02:41:50,029
..was thrown against
the back of the house.

2646
02:41:50,114 --> 02:41:54,266
One was thrown on the side
of the house, from what l could tell.

2647
02:41:55,154 --> 02:41:57,873
lt bounced up against the window.
That's what woke my daughter up.

2648
02:41:57,954 --> 02:41:59,554
Had it gone in,...

2649
02:41:59,554 --> 02:42:02,990
..my two-year-old, my four-year-old and
my six-year-old daughter would've been...

2650
02:42:03,074 --> 02:42:05,030
l'm just telling you, had that happened,...

2651
02:42:05,114 --> 02:42:07,423
..l'd've taken my rifle,
l'd've gone after anyone in sight.

2652
02:42:07,514 --> 02:42:10,312
Do you think this was a warning,
or an attempt on your life?

2653
02:42:10,394 --> 02:42:12,783
What does it look like?
Does it look like a warning to you?

2654
02:42:12,874 --> 02:42:16,230
This is a definite attempt
by the Nation of lslam...

2655
02:42:16,314 --> 02:42:18,669
..upon the strict orders
of Mr Elijah Muhammad.

2656
02:42:18,754 --> 02:42:20,710
D'you know what they're saying
at the Muslim headquarters?

2657
02:42:20,794 --> 02:42:23,149
lt doesn't matter to me.
l can tell what they're doing.

2658
02:42:23,234 --> 02:42:27,113
Minister Baines, can you please tell us,
who bombed the house?

2659
02:42:27,194 --> 02:42:31,073
Uh, we feel it's a publicity stunt
on the part of Malcolm X,...

2660
02:42:31,154 --> 02:42:35,705
..but we hope it isn't a case of... if he can't
keep the house, we won't get it, either.

2661
02:42:35,794 --> 02:42:38,228
That's enough. 'Scuse me.

2662
02:42:39,914 --> 02:42:41,870
(tyres screech)

2663
02:42:42,594 --> 02:42:44,824
- Malcolm!
- l'm all right. l'm all right.

2664
02:42:44,914 --> 02:42:47,030
- Betty and the kids?
- They're fine. They're across the street.

2665
02:42:47,114 --> 02:42:49,070
Let's get two men on post,
two in front of the house.

2666
02:42:49,154 --> 02:42:51,463
- Brother Minister, did you see anybody?
- No, l didn't see anyone.

2667
02:42:51,554 --> 02:42:53,670
But l know who it is.
You know l know who did it.

2668
02:42:53,754 --> 02:42:55,710
- Give us the command, Malcolm.
- Don't worry about the command.

2669
02:42:55,794 --> 02:42:59,548
- Two men here on post, two in front.
- We got an informer.

2670
02:43:31,194 --> 02:43:32,343
Spark it.

2671
02:43:41,834 --> 02:43:44,394
As salaam alaikum, my brothers.

2672
02:43:44,474 --> 02:43:46,465
Here's yourkey,...

2673
02:43:46,554 --> 02:43:49,466

..why didn't you inform me about this
last night? l talked to you.

2825
02:53:17,514 --> 02:53:19,470
- l called Sister Betty...
- You didn't have to call Sister Betty!

2826
02:53:19,554 --> 02:53:22,307
l talked to you. You should've told me!
What are you telling Sister Betty for?

2827
02:53:22,394 --> 02:53:24,544
- Well, l assumed...
- Don't assume anything!

2828
02:53:33,754 --> 02:53:35,745
Go on down.

2829
02:53:35,834 --> 02:53:39,588
- Sister, you go on with the brother.
- Yes, sir.

2830
02:53:52,754 --> 02:53:54,710
Malcolm.

2831
02:53:56,474 --> 02:53:58,510
What's wrong?

2832
02:54:14,194 --> 02:54:16,628
Fine. Let's cancel it.

2833
02:54:19,434 --> 02:54:21,902
My wife out there? And the children?

2834
02:54:21,994 --> 02:54:24,349
They're out front as always.

2835
02:54:26,754 --> 02:54:30,508
All right,
you go out to the payphone outside.

2836
02:54:30,754 --> 02:54:34,827
Call up the Reverend
and see if he can make it down here.

2837
02:54:34,914 --> 02:54:39,305
l gotta be on post, Malcolm.
l'm supposed to be out there guardin' you.

2838
02:54:39,394 --> 02:54:41,350
That's a duty for secretarial staff.

2839
02:54:41,434 --> 02:54:44,426
- l'll ask Sister Robin if she...
- Go outside to the payphone.

2840
02:54:44,514 --> 02:54:47,904
Call up the Reverend.
See if he can make it down here.

2841
02:54:51,994 --> 02:54:53,950
All right.

2842
02:55:24,514 --> 02:55:26,470
(walkie-talkie crackles)

2843
02:55:28,874 --> 02:55:32,628
- Responding.
- AII right.

2844
02:55:40,954 --> 02:55:42,910
PIease, Iet's settIe down.

2845
02:55:42,994 --> 02:55:46,543
Let's get the programme started.
The Minister wiII be out...

2846
02:55:46,954 --> 02:55:48,990
Thank you.

2847
02:55:52,754 --> 02:55:56,986
l apologise for raising my voice earlier.
Very disrespectful.

2848
02:55:57,314 --> 02:55:59,828
Brother Minister, l understand.

2849
02:56:08,514 --> 02:56:10,948
Lifestyles are changing,
minds are changing,...

2850
02:56:11,034 --> 02:56:12,626
..why, everything is changing!

2851
02:56:12,714 --> 02:56:16,389
So you and l must consider that
we're living in very, very changing times.

2852
02:56:16,474 --> 02:56:20,183
And what might be true today
may not be true tomorrow.

2853
02:56:20,274 --> 02:56:22,788
And without any further ado,...

2854
02:56:22,874 --> 02:56:26,264
..l present to you
Brother Minister Malcolm.

2855
02:56:26,354 --> 02:56:30,029
And l pray that you and l will listen.

2856
02:56:30,114 --> 02:56:31,342
Listen,...

2857
02:56:31,954 --> 02:56:35,344
..hear, and understand. Thank you.

2858
02:56:41,994 --> 02:56:43,393
Daddy!

2859
02:56:54,674 --> 02:56:56,904
- As salaam alaikum.
- Wa-alaikum salaam.

2860
02:56:56,994 --> 02:56:59,144
Get your hand outta my pocket!

2861
02:56:59,234 --> 02:57:01,111
- Get your hands outta my pocket!
- Brother...

2862
02:57:01,194 --> 02:57:03,264
Brother, please, hold it!

2863
02:57:03,354 --> 02:57:05,151
- (screaming)
- Calm down!

2864
02:57:05,234 --> 02:57:06,713
- Please, brothers!
- Oh, my God!

2865
02:57:07,354 --> 02:57:08,992
Malcolm!

2866
02:57:09,594 --> 02:57:11,425
- (screams)
- Malcolm!

2867
02:57:11,514 --> 02:57:13,072

2868
02:57:21,114 --> 02:57:23,992

2869
02:57:24,074 --> 02:57:26,030
(gunshots)

2870
02:57:30,554 --> 02:57:31,589
Hey!

2871
02:57:32,314 --> 02:57:33,429
Come on!

2872
02:57:36,274 --> 02:57:38,230
- Shoot him!

2873
02:57:40,234 --> 02:57:43,146
- (shrieks)
- C'mon! C'mon!

2874
02:57:43,234 --> 02:57:44,189
Malcolm!

2875
02:57:45,314 --> 02:57:46,952
(wails)

2876
02:57:47,034 --> 02:57:50,993
- Get an ambulance! Get an ambulance!
- Somebody get an ambulance!

2877
02:57:51,074 --> 02:57:52,348
They killed him!

2878
02:57:53,594 --> 02:57:55,983
(sobs) They kiIIed him!

2879
02:57:57,474 --> 02:57:59,510
- (gunshot)
- (cries out)

2880
02:57:59,594 --> 02:58:01,505
Ah, fuck!

2881
02:58:01,754 --> 02:58:04,314
- Kill him!
- Get him, he shot Brother Malcolm!

2882
02:58:04,394 --> 02:58:07,750
- l'm gonna kill him! l'm gonna kill him!
- No!

2883
02:58:07,834 --> 02:58:10,064
l didn't do it! l didn't...

2884
02:58:10,154 --> 02:58:12,907
- Get him!
- (shouting)

2885
02:58:12,994 --> 02:58:14,268
He killed Malcolm!

2886
02:58:14,714 --> 02:58:17,467
(policeman shouts)

2887
02:58:17,554 --> 02:58:20,273
- Kill him!
- Back off!

2888
02:58:23,634 --> 02:58:25,272
l seen him!

2889
02:58:25,354 --> 02:58:28,027
- He did it!
- No!

2890
02:58:31,434 --> 02:58:33,390
(sobs)

2891
02:58:44,554 --> 02:58:46,510
(Betty keens)

2892
02:58:58,554 --> 02:59:00,624
(Betty wails)

2893
02:59:11,794 --> 02:59:14,547
- Get out of the way! C'mon, folks!
- (siren wails)

2894
02:59:14,634 --> 02:59:16,465
Get out of the way, please!

2895
02:59:16,554 --> 02:59:20,024
- Move it! Get out of the way! Get back!
- Move! Move! Move, move!

2896
02:59:20,114 --> 02:59:22,753
- Please! Get out of the way!
- Move! Move!

2897
02:59:22,834 --> 02:59:26,270
- Everybody! Stand back!
- C'mon, move!

2898
02:59:26,354 --> 02:59:29,790
Move him across! Stand back!
Get out of the way! Get back!

2899
02:59:29,874 --> 02:59:34,231
- (shouting)
- Please! One statement! Please!

2900
02:59:34,314 --> 02:59:37,511
The person you know as Malcolm X
is no more.

2901
02:59:37,914 --> 02:59:41,031
The assassination of Malcolm X...

2902
02:59:41,114 --> 02:59:43,753
..was an unfortunate tragedy.

2903
02:59:43,994 --> 02:59:49,307
lt reveals that there are still, er,
numerous people in our nation...

2904
02:59:49,394 --> 02:59:54,627
..who have degenerated to the point
of expressing dissent through murder,...

2905
02:59:54,714 --> 02:59:58,832
..and we haven't learned to disagree
without being violently disagreeable.

2906
03:00:00,314 --> 03:00:02,032
(Ossie Davis) Here,...

2907
03:00:02,114 --> 03:00:04,389
..at this finaI hour,...

2908
03:00:05,074 --> 03:00:07,269
..in this quietpIace,...

2909
03:00:07,914 --> 03:00:12,624
..HarIem has come to bid fareweII
to one ofits brightest hopes,...

2910
03:00:13,554 --> 03:00:15,510
..extinguished now,...

2911
03:00:16,034 --> 03:00:18,389
..and gone from us forever.

2912
03:00:19,314 --> 03:00:22,306
It is not in the memory ofman...

2913
03:00:22,394 --> 03:00:23,986
- (gunshot)
- ..that this beIeaguered, unfortunate,...

2914
03:00:24,074 --> 03:00:26,224
..but nonetheIess proud community...

2915
03:00:26,314 --> 03:00:29,750
..has found a braver,
more gaIIantyoung champion...

2916
03:00:29,834 --> 03:00:32,223
..than this Afro-American...

2917
03:00:32,314 --> 03:00:34,430
..who Iies before us,...

2918
03:00:35,354 --> 03:00:38,073
..unconquered stiII.

2919
03:00:38,994 --> 03:00:41,349
I say the word again
as he wouId want me to,...

2920
03:00:41,434 --> 03:00:42,833
..Afro-American.

2921
03:00:43,234 --> 03:00:46,226
Afro-American MaIcoIm.

2922
03:00:46,434 --> 03:00:50,507
MaIcoIm had stopped being Negro
years ago.

2923
03:00:50,834 --> 03:00:52,904
It had become too smaII, too puny,...

2924
03:00:52,994 --> 03:00:55,633
..too weak a word forhim.

2925
03:00:55,714 --> 03:00:57,909
MaIcoIm was bigger than that.

2926
03:00:57,994 --> 03:01:01,907
MaIcoIm had become an Afro-American.

2927
03:01:01,994 --> 03:01:04,224
And he wanted so desperateIy...

2928
03:01:04,314 --> 03:01:07,272
..that we, that aII his peopIe,...

2929
03:01:07,354 --> 03:01:10,391
..wouId become Afro-Americans, too.

2930
03:01:14,394 --> 03:01:17,545
There are those
who stiII considerit their duty...

2931
03:01:17,634 --> 03:01:23,470
..as ''friends ofthe Negro peopIe''
to teII us to reviIe him,...

2932
03:01:23,554 --> 03:01:26,864
..to fIee even from
the presence ofhis memory,...

2933
03:01:26,954 --> 03:01:33,063
..to save ourseIves by writing him
out ofthe history ofour turbuIent times.

2934
03:01:33,514 --> 03:01:35,550
And we wiII smiIe.

2935
03:01:35,634 --> 03:01:38,273
They wiII say that
he is ofhate, a fanatic,...

2936
03:01:38,354 --> 03:01:42,745
..a racist who can onIy bring eviI
to the cause for which you struggIe.

2937
03:01:42,834 --> 03:01:45,632
And we wiII answer and say unto them...

2938
03:01:45,834 --> 03:01:49,349
''Didyou ever taIk to BrotherMaIcoIm?''

2939
03:01:50,194 --> 03:01:54,312
Didyou ever touch him,
orhave him smiIe atyou?

2940
03:01:54,394 --> 03:01:56,703
Didyou everreaIIy Iisten to him?

2941
03:01:56,794 --> 03:01:58,671
You haven't done the right thing!

2942
03:01:58,754 --> 03:02:03,270
Was he everhimseIfassociated with
vioIence, or any pubIic disturbance?

2943
03:02:03,354 --> 03:02:05,868
Forifyou did, you wouId know him.

2944
03:02:05,954 --> 03:02:11,347
And ifyou did, you wouId know
why we must honourhim.

2945
03:02:11,434 --> 03:02:15,666
MaIcoIm was ourmanhood,
ourIiving, bIack manhood.

2946
03:02:15,754 --> 03:02:17,984
This was his meaning to his peopIe.

2947
03:02:18,074 --> 03:02:22,829
And in honouring him,
we honour the best in ourseIves.

2948
03:02:23,874 --> 03:02:26,468
Howevermuch
we may have differed with him,...

2949
03:02:26,554 --> 03:02:29,591
..or with each other about him
and his vaIue as a man,...

2950
03:02:29,674 --> 03:02:31,824
..Iet his going from us...

2951
03:02:31,914 --> 03:02:34,872
..serve onIy to bring us togethernow.

2952
03:02:35,914 --> 03:02:41,034
Consigning these mortaI remains
to earth, the common mother ofaII,...

2953
03:02:41,274 --> 03:02:43,629
..secure in the knowIedge
that what we pIace in the ground...

2954
03:02:43,714 --> 03:02:45,352
..is no more now a man...

2955
03:02:45,434 --> 03:02:47,504
..but a seed,...

2956
03:02:47,594 --> 03:02:49,903
..which, after the winter
ofour discontent,...

2957
03:02:49,994 --> 03:02:53,987
- ..wiII come forth again to meet us.
- (crowd chants) Malcolm X!

2958
03:02:54,074 --> 03:02:58,784
And we shaII know him then
for what he was and is:

2959
03:02:59,274 --> 03:03:00,787
..a prince.

2960
03:03:00,874 --> 03:03:04,708
Our own bIack shining prince,...

2961
03:03:05,354 --> 03:03:07,914
..who didn 't hesitate to die,...

2962
03:03:08,514 --> 03:03:11,824
..because he Ioved us so.

2963
03:03:11,914 --> 03:03:13,870
(woman) And so, today,...

2964
03:03:13,954 --> 03:03:17,310
..May 1 9th,
we celebrate Malcolm X's birthday,...

2965
03:03:17,394 --> 03:03:21,353
..because he was a great,
great Afro-American.

2966
03:03:21,434 --> 03:03:26,189
Malcolm X is you. All of you.
And you are Malcolm X.

2967
03:03:26,674 --> 03:03:27,743
l'm Malcolm X!

2968
03:03:27,834 --> 03:03:29,028
l'm Malcolm X!

2969
03:03:29,114 --> 03:03:31,070
l'm Malcolm X!

2970
03:03:31,154 --> 03:03:32,109

2971
03:03:32,194 --> 03:03:33,388
l am Malcolm X!

2972

l am Malcolm X!

2976
03:03:39,034 --> 03:03:41,468
As Brother Malcolm said,...
