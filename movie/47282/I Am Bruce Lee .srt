1
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,370
如果某人不喜欢李小龙的电影 我肯定不会理他
If someone says, "I can't watch a Bruce Lee film," I can't talk to 'em.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,730
李小龙是世界著名功夫明星
Bruce Lee is a worldwide fighting icon.

3
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,080
他是个130磅的致命武器
He was a 130-something-pound lethal weapon.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,320
李小龙和他的
Bruce and his fighting style changed the game.

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,080
刚开始练习的时候没有明确的目的
In the beginning I had no intention that what I was practising,

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,430
但是现在我明白自己的目标是什么
and what I am still practising now, would lead to this.

7
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,810
李小龙 鲍勃·迪伦 阿里 Jay-Z 伍兹 科比 乔丹
Bruce Lee, Bob Dylan, Ali, Jay-Z, Tiger, Kobe, Jordan,

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,630
他们有着共同的精神信念
they all have the same spirit.

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,970
他的表演没有加入任何特效 全都是亲自上阵
No stunt coordinator coordinated his shit. He did it himself.

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,750
李小龙在电影里展现的是他最真实的样子
The guy you see in Bruce's films is the way Bruce was in person.

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,280
他有时会生气
He could lose his temper.

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,570
我的偶像是李小龙
Bruce Lee is my idol.

13
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,430
他不仅是导演 还是编剧和演员
He was directing, writing, acting.

14
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,270
我甚至已经忽略了他的亚裔身份 他就是偶像
I don't even look at him as being Asian. He's my idol.

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,420
当你想到李小龙时 你不会觉得他是普通的亚洲演员
When you think of Bruce Lee, you don't think about the Asian karate guy.

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,710
他是一个传奇
You think about a legacy.

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,540
他的那些动作
The moves that he could do,

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,520
总会让你误以为是加速镜头
you were wondering if they were speeding up the camera.

19
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,800
李小龙是亚洲人心目中的英雄
Bruce Lee was like the superhero of the Asian community.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,310
他就像穆罕穆德·阿里或马尔科姆·艾克斯
You had Muhammad Ali. You had Malcolm X.

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,600
他是属于亚洲人的精神领袖
Bruce Lee represented that same kind of radicalism.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,720
非常完美的组合
Technically brilliant choreography.

23
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,210
他具有神秘感 同时具有阳刚之气 就是这么完美
You get mysticism, hyper-masculinity. This guy is like, bang!

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,650
他提升了中国人的形象
He's put balls on Chinese men.

25
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,780
这也有很酷的一面
There's some cool stuff.

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,540
你会想这个人竟然就是我爸爸
You're like, "Wow. That supercool guy is my dad."

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,970
-世界上只有一个李小龙  -
- There'll never be another Bruce Lee. - Baby, here I am, man.

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,110
这个中国人是怎样成为历史上最伟大的武术家呢
How does a small Chinese guy become the greatest martial artist of all time?

29
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,000

Production 263-05-224-10. Test X1, take 1.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,130
李小龙 请看向镜头
Bruce, just look right into the camera

31
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,090
然后介绍一下你的姓名 年龄和籍贯
and tell us your name, your age and where you were born.

32
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,440
我姓李 全名李小龙
My last name is Lee, Bruce Lee.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,460
1940年出生于旧金山 今年24岁
I was born in San Francisco in 1940. I'm 24 right now.

34
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,740
当时把他带回美国后 引来了许多非议
There was controversy about me taking him back to the United States.

35
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,640
但是在此之前 他很享受西雅图的生活
But he loved his time that he lived in Seattle before all of this.

36
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,510
我的孩子们需要有父亲的陪伴
It was important for my children to know where their father was.

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,590
我忍不住哭出来
I just intimately just started crying.

38
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,410
葬礼结束后 我好像不停地在哭泣
I think I literally cried after the funeral all the way from Seattle,

39
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,940
从西雅图开始 一路哭到加州的萨克拉门托
all the way to the California border, all the way up to Sacramento.

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,460
当时离开香港并不简单
That was a very difficult time to leave Hong Kong

41
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,160
因为... 带走了他们最爱的小儿子
and... take their favourite son away.

42
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,980
如果以李小龙的毕生成就来看
Bruce's childhood is interesting to look at

43
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,140
他的童年非常有意义
from the standpoint of where he ended up.

44
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,260
首先 二十世纪四十年代初的香港
First of all, Hong Kong in the early '40s

45
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,340
处于二战时期日本人占领时期
was occupied by Japan during World War ll,

46
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,820
这也影响了李小龙
and this had an influence on Bruce.

47
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,480
他从小就认识到独立自强的重要性
It was very important to him as a child from the get-go to be self-sufficient,

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,090
你必须担负更多的个人责任才能做到这一点
and in doing that, you have to shoulder a lot of personal responsibility.

49
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,170
大陆和香港地区以及日本之间曾有一段不愉快的历史
There's bad blood historically between China and Hong Kong and Japan.

50
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,490
李小龙母亲曾告诉我 他经常靠在阳台上
His mother used to tell me how Bruce would hang over the side of the balcony

51
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,120
朝着过往的日本飞机挥舞拳头
and shake his fist at the Japanese planes coming to land in Hong Kong.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,380
如果有人贬低中国 他肯定与对方一争高下
If anyone said a word against the Chinese, he would rebel.

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,720
你在香港从事电影工作吗
And you work in motion pictures in Hong Kong?

54
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,510
是的 我六岁就入行了
Yes, since I was around six years old.

55
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,130
受其父亲影响 李小龙成了童星
Bruce became a child actor under his father's influence,

56
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,400
他父亲不仅是一名京剧演员
his father being an actor in the Chinese opera

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,290
还参演了多部粤语电影
and then in Cantonese films as well.

58
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,610
跟大家介绍一下香港电影拍摄的工作时间吧
Tell the crew what time they shoot the pictures in Hong Kong.

59
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,100
拍摄工作集中在早晨 因为香港很热闹
Well, it's mostly in the morning because it's kind of noisy in Hong Kong,

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,510
你也知道人口密集
you know, around three million people there,

61
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,330
如果想在香港拍电影
so every time when you have a picture,

62
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,240
我们会把拍摄时间安排在凌晨零点至清晨五点
it's mostly, say, around 12am to 5am in the morning.

63
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,310
很多人不知道的是
A lot of people don't touch on this,

64
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,150
他曾经是香港最著名的童星
but he was the biggest childhood star in Hong Kong.

65
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,180
童星时期他拍摄了大约二十部电影
He made 20, 20-something movies as a child star.

66
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,090
就像旧时代的麦考利·库尔金
He was like the Macaulay Culkin of that era.

67
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,440
字幕
And then you have the fact that Hong Kong was governed by the British.

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,490
字幕
They targeted the British.

69
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,360

You are crazy.

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
字幕
But there's a lot of competition between the British people living there

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
字幕
and the Chinese living there.

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
字幕
He's also part Caucasian.

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,090
字幕
I think he saw a lot of adversity racially,

74
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,670
字幕
not only around him but within himself.

75
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,020
字幕
And he had run-ins with English schoolboys and that kind of thing,

76
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,460

so there was always that feeling of resentment

77
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,790
字幕
of others dictating his future.

78
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,320

Then, of course, when he was 13, he went to study with Yip Man.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,520
字幕
As human beings, fighting's in our DNA. We get it and we like it.

80
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,000
字幕
Yip Man trained Bruce in wing chun,

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,140
字幕
and Yip Man was a fabulous kung fu master.

82
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,770
字幕
Bruce had many run-ins with the law

83
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,860
字幕
and other teenagers in Hong Kong, and he had fights.

84
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,740
字幕
He loved the street fights. He loved other people who can street-fight.

85
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,990
字幕
Bruce's style is made for street survival.

86
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,300
字幕
He grew up fighting fights in Hong Kong on the rooftop.

87
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,490
李小龙给我们展示了一些电影 比如八毫米电影
Bruce had some of the films, 8mm, that he used to show us,

88
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,840
演员们采用传统的武术站式
where they get into the old traditional stance

89
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,620
其中一人冲过来打几拳
and one guy would come in and throw a couple of punches

90
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,520
另一人往后撤 倒在设定好的位子上
and the other guy would back up and fall down over the plant pot.

91
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,900
南拳有两大主要派系 蔡礼佛拳
There were two clans usually, the choy li fut clan

92
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,490
以及咏春拳
and the wing chun clan

93
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,420
也就是叶问的派系 两派之间常有比拼
by Yip Man and his students, and they would have battles.

94
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,190
蔡礼佛拳和咏春拳之间确实存在派系斗争
Although this stuff about the choy li fut and wing chun rooftop fights

95
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,400
非常具有传奇色彩
is the stuff of legend, it is true.

96
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,630
我去过香港
I was in Hong Kong.

97
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,990
蔡礼佛拳和咏春拳之间的爱恨情仇仍旧存在
The sentiment, the animosity between wing chun and choy li fut still exists.

98
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,410
叶问对李小龙的影响非常大
So Yip Man was a great influence on Bruce

99
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,330
甚至影响了他的思想
and leaned him in the direction of philosophy.

100
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,990
但是李小龙也成就了叶问的传奇地位
Yip Man would not be a legend without Bruce Lee.

101
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,310
在此之前咏春拳是一种非常偏门的拳法
Wing chun was a very, very minor martial art style,

102
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,310
但现在风靡全球 这都要归功于李小龙
and now it's global, and that's all because of Bruce Lee.

103
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,190
武术需要你真实地表现自我
Ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself.

104
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,070
做起来并不简单
Now, it is very difficult to do.

105
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,960
在我看来大部分武术精神值得人们尊敬
A lot of that warrior spirit, to me, it's really honourable.

106
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,040
非常纯粹
It's really pure.

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,420
它能够渗透进不同文化 不同语言 不同种族
It breaks through to every culture, every language, every colour.

108
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,410
它是一个赢得尊重的过程
It's all about getting respect back, you know.

109
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,090
如果你要伤害我 你最好直接把我打得心服口服 混蛋
If you're gonna hurt me, you're gonna have to earn it, motherfucker.

110
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,400
我是三兄弟中最小的
I was the youngest of three boys.

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,770
我着迷于李小龙和武术
I got obsessed with Bruce Lee and martial arts.

112
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,720
我想狠揍我的兄弟 以此证明我的价值
I wanted to kick my brothers' asses and prove my worthiness.

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,200
每当遇到一场高质量的比拼 你总是忍不住激动起来
When a good fight breaks out, you can't help but be excited.

114
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,730
你忍不住要显露感情
You can't help but show emotion.

115
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,910
虽然过程漫长 但每当我兄弟要找我麻烦时
It took a while, but as many times as each of my brothers beat me up,

116
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,530
我总能狠揍其中一个 这就够了
each one of them got one ass-kicking from me and that was it.

117
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,110
字幕
I didn't do so well talking shit back,

118
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,040
字幕
so I don't see the point in talking about it. Let's just go there.

119
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,500
字幕
But then you feel bad and embarrassed afterwards, "That was childish."

120
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,520
字幕
"I could have handled that better." But you also feel good.

121
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,650
字幕
If you couldn't get laid, you got in a fight.

122
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,670
字幕
Let me punch this ugly motherfucker.

123
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,260
字幕
In Youngstown. It was a nice place to live.

124
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,290
字幕
Fighting has taken over my mind and my being.

125
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,800
字幕
It's not what I do. It's who I am.

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,350
字幕
My father told me fighters are born, not made. Bruce Lee was a born fighter.

127
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,270
字幕
When you do punch, now I'm leaning forward a little bit,

128
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,020
字幕
hoping not to hurt any camera angle.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,300
字幕
I mean, you gotta put the whole hip into it and snap it

130
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,580
字幕
and get all your energy in there, and make this into a weapon.

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,580
字幕
When Bruce Lee was a young boy, maybe 13 or 14, training in wing chun,

132
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,440
字幕
they found out that Bruce Lee had Caucasian blood.

133
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,170
字幕
- I believe it's one fourth German. - Well?

134
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,670
字幕
The other students said he shouldn't be allowed to learn wing chun

135
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,850
字幕
because he wasn't purely Chinese.

136
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,270
字幕
When you're by yourself and no one wants to be there

137
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,560
字幕
because they didn't wanna get beat up, it's the loneliest feeling in the world.

138
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,980
字幕
One thing I have definitely learned in my life

139
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,740
字幕
is that I do have a bad temper.

140
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,610
字幕
A violent temper, in fact.

141
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,020
字幕
His whole life is sort of this play between East and West.

142
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,680
字幕
He hated the oppression of little people

143
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,050
字幕
which he saw everywhere, in the Japanese occupation,

144
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,660
字幕
the Boxer Rebellion,

145
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,220
字幕
the foreign powers going into China.

146
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,510
字幕
He just thought all of that was wrong.

147
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,190
字幕
To live the life he wanted to live, he had to fight for it.

148
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,670
字幕
He really had to put it out there and really walk the walk.

149
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,530
字幕
I mean, it is easy for me to put on a show

150
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,200
字幕
and be cocky and be flooded with a cocky feeling

151
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,770
字幕
and then feel like pretty cool and all that.

152
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,470
字幕
Or I can make all kinds of phoney things, you see what I mean?

153
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,840
字幕
Blinded by it. Or I can show you some really fancy movement.

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,970
字幕
But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself,

155
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,390
字幕
and to express myself honestly,

156
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,660
字幕
that, my friend, is...

157
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,210
字幕
In some ways it's the total opposite of anger.

158
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,000
字幕
It's beauty, it's passion, it's art.

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,540
字幕
It's... It's painting a picture without tools.

160
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,950
字幕
It was a surprise, but an understandable one,

161
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,620
字幕
when I found out that Bruce Lee was a cha-cha champion,

162
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,310
字幕
because you could see that reflected in his fighting style.

163
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,360
字幕
He was the 1957 Hong Kong cha-cha champion.

164
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,180
字幕
People don't know that. His footwork was impeccable.

165
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,340
字幕
Incredible samba dancer.

166
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,830
字幕
He didn't move like anybody else. He moved like himself.

167
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,850
字幕
In a fight you have footwork and you have form

168
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,730
字幕
and you have stance and power that you interject,

169
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,160
字幕
and that's the way that dancing and martial arts go hand in hand.

170
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,740
字幕
For him to be steeped into that rhythm reinforced why black people

171
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,050
字幕
have always identified with Bruce and his fighting style.

172
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,050
字幕
So what I got from Bruce as a performer is...

173
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,200
字幕
You know, most performers perform like this, right? Straight up.

174
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,630
字幕
Me, perform from the side,

175
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,310
字幕
sort of like how Bruce used to always, you know,

176
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,920
字幕
be ready for combat like this.

177
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,050
字幕
Honestly expressing yourself, like me being a dancer,

178
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,100
字幕
that's what it's all about.

179
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,010
字幕
That's another big, big philosophy from him that I take with me to this day.

180
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,510
字幕
So I'll be performing like, "Bah, bah! Bah, bah, bah, bah!"

181
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,260
字幕
I keep trying to dig deeper and deeper within myself

182
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,270
字幕
and find that fluidity that no one can replicate.

183
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,240
字幕
That's the vibe that Bruce Lee taught me.

184
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,500
字幕
It's to always bring it.

185
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,280
字幕
That's what I get from Bruce.

186
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,540
字幕
- And when did you leave Hong Kong? - 1959, when I was 18.

187
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,150
字幕
It had gotten a little difficult with the police on one side

188
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,420
字幕
and with gangs on the other side.

189
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,810
字幕
He beat this kid up, but he didn't know that the kid

190
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,230
字幕
was the son of a high-ranking police officer in Hong Kong.

191
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,390
字幕
He got into so many street fights that by 18, his father gave him $100

192
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,740
字幕
and sent him off to America.

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,650
字幕
If he wanted his immigration status to be US citizen,

194
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,300
字幕
then he had to return by the time he was 18.

195
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,620
字幕
To go when you're still a star is very strange,

196
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,970
字幕
because he could have kept doing films, but they wanted him to go,

197
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,990
字幕
to make the right decision of where he's going next.

198
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,240
字幕
In Seattle, my father started teaching martial arts.

199
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,220
字幕
He didn't ever look at people because of their race or their stature in life.

200
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,810
字幕
If you had a sincere interest in martial arts, he would teach you.

201
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,110
字幕
Taky Kimura was really his best friend.

202
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,080
字幕
Taky became his first assistant instructor in his first school,

203
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,830
字幕
the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute, in Seattle, Washington.

204
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,740
字幕
Bruce used to come to my high school

205
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,100
字幕
and he used to teach in the Chinese philosophy class.

206
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,300
字幕
He was five years older than we were and I do remember my heart going,

207
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,060
字幕
"Pah, pah, pah", you know, "He is sure cute."

208
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,430
字幕
It wasn't long after that that I started taking gung fu lessons from him,

209
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,130
字幕
and my relationship with him changed more from just a student

210
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:46,040
字幕
to actually feeling that maybe, maybe there could be a connection between us.

211
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,430
字幕
We both attended the University of Washington.

212
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,160
字幕
We would get together on campus

213
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,150
字幕
and attend our classes,

214
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,540
字幕
occasionally, when we weren't doing gung fu or something else.

215
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,120
字幕
And then when we were both done with our classes,

216
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
字幕
we would rush back to his studio,

217
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,610
字幕
which was just right there in the university district,

218
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,150
字幕
and we'd turn on the TV and watch General Hospital every day.

219
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,720
字幕
And it was like, "We have to get there. It's almost three o'clock!"

220
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,800
字幕
In the '60s, marriages were happening in California.

221
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,930
字幕
In the rest of the country there were no interracial marriages. It was difficult.

222
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,520
字幕
My mother was not thrilled when we decided to get married

223
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,550
字幕
and didn't want her daughter to have to suffer any negativity from others.

224
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,330
字幕
The ban on interracial marriage was lifted in 1968.

225
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,090
字幕
That didn't mean the ban lifted in people's hearts.

226
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,060
字幕
Bruce was very strong in saying,

227
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,540
字幕
"I want to marry Linda. I know that we are a good match."

228
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,850
字幕
And so we did get married. It was really hard on my mother.

229
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,840
字幕
But it wasn't long before she came to love Bruce very much.

230
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,280
字幕
It's so important to know that it was his wife Linda that grounded him.

231
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,130
字幕
She was his rock.

232
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,540
字幕
As a couple, we really did not suffer any prejudice from outsiders,

233
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,450
字幕
and I think this had a great deal to do with Bruce's overwhelming personality.

234
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,960
字幕
I absolutely recognise that my uncle was a gorgeous man.

235
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,990
字幕
He's got swagger. We love his style.

236
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,840
字幕
He had style the way Muhammad Ali had style in the ring.

237
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,900
字幕
He was like the Elvis of martial arts. He looked like a movie star.

238
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,830
字幕
He was always such a snappy dresser and so handsome.

239
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,900
字幕
I've heard the term that he's put balls on Chinese men.

240
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:35,330
字幕
He's shown that the Chinese man can be, you know, sexy and hot and enticing.

241
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,120
字幕
I'm trying to copy his hair.

242
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,220
字幕
That's why my hair is long.

243
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,890
字幕
After Bruce Lee, my God, Chinese men, they're a force to be reckoned with.

244
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,980
字幕
They're invincible. So that's an amazing transformation.

245
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,770
字幕
He's one of a kind and extremely attractive.

246
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,110
字幕
That would be for both straight women and a lot of gay men that I know too.

247
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,170
字幕
Let's just put it this way.

248
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,630
字幕
I think the one thing that's missing in my life right now is Bruce Lee.

249
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,100
字幕
A man like Bruce Lee.

250
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,600
字幕
The first internationals were in Long Beach.

251
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,740
字幕
I was instructed to take out Bruce Lee. He was the guest.

252
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,860
字幕
So I was sort of like the tour guide for him.

253
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,080
字幕
He demonstrated his art before he even demonstrated

254
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,840
字幕
in front of the black-belt audience.

255
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,610
字幕
In the hotel room he says, "You can use everything, you can side-kick,

256
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,320
字幕
you can round-kick, and I'll just use my jab."

257
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,260
字幕
When he knocked me out, it was more like a hook.

258
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,550
字幕
It sort of came off the side like that. The ease in which he did it,

259
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,190
字幕
and explaining while he was doing it to me,

260
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,070
字幕
that was mind-boggling for me.

261
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,970
字幕
It was like a bad dream, like the dreams where you can't run.

262
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,080
字幕
When Bruce Lee came up and did his performance of his gung fu,

263
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,390
字幕
it was something I had never seen before.

264
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,610
字幕
He said, "The individual is more important in any style or system."

265
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,050
字幕
I said, "I need to train with a man like this."

266
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,360
字幕
He was just so ahead of the times.

267
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,390
字幕
He'd go to Ed Parker's events in Long Beach and they treated him like a god.

268
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,860
字幕
When he did his one-thumb push-ups, you could hear a pin drop.

269
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,570
字幕
He showed his speed, showed his power,

270
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,420
字幕
showed his one-inch punch.

271
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,880
字幕
People say, "Bruce Lee is the fastest person on earth."

272
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,460
字幕
He did these things so realistically

273
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,090
字幕
that people didn't know if it was show business or the real McCoy.

274
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,170
字幕
When Bruce did the demonstration in 1964,

275
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,640
字幕
before he had even come back to Oakland where we lived at the time,

276
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,210
字幕
I had received a phone call from William Dozier's office.

277
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,530
字幕
Jay Sebring, the famous hair stylist, happened to see my father

278
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,460
字幕
at the Long Beach internationals, and he cut the hair of William Dozier.

279
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,790
字幕
He said, "You have to see this guy. He's amazing."

280
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,190
字幕
When Bruce came home, I said to him,

281
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,810
字幕
"You need to call this guy back, William Dozier."

282
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,370
字幕
"He's a producer in Hollywood and he wants to see you."

283
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,000
字幕
That was the first inkling that,

284
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,800
字幕
"Wow, I might be able to do something in Hollywood."

285
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,070
字幕
Look directly into the camera.

286
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,020
字幕
Very dapper. He's got the suit and the tie, you know, white shirt.

287
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,770
字幕
He's so elegant.

288
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,530
字幕
But he feels like a coiled cobra.

289
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,150
字幕
- You've just had a baby boy? - Yeah.

290
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,680
字幕
And you've lost a little sleep over it, have you?

291
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,010
字幕
Three nights.

292
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,440
字幕
He was 24, and he went in there, it's almost like,

293
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,430
字幕
"You're lucky that I'm here auditioning for you."

294
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,180
字幕
There is the finger jab There is the punch.

295
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,530
字幕
Just the poise he had said it all.

296
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,160
字幕
There is the back fist and elbow.

297
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,470
字幕
Even in conversation, you could feel his explosive nature.

298
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,570
字幕
Of course, then they use legs, straight to the groin or come up.

299
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,140
字幕
That's a special kind of star power.

300
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,290
字幕
Or, if I can back up a little bit,

301
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,920
字幕
we stop at the... and then come back.

302
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,600
字幕
- Alright. - This kind of works.

303
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,490
字幕
He never had any intention of going into show business.

304
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,570
字幕
His passion was his martial arts,

305
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,130
字幕
so he had a school in Seattle and a second school in Oakland.

306
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,400
字幕
His plan was to open many, many schools all over the county.

307
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,350
字幕
Obviously he started with the classical Chinese arts, which is wing chun.

308
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,180
字幕
And then everyone knows about the fight in 1964 in Oakland.

309
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,580
字幕
There's the famous story about how he was challenged

310
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,740
字幕
by the Chinese community in Oakland,

311
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,210
字幕
and he had to defend the right to teach his art to non-Chinese people.

312
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,230
字幕
You and this entire society are useless in this country. You are archaic.

313
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,370
字幕
And you're a fool to think that you can break away from us

314
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,880
字幕
merely because you choose to.

315
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,300
字幕
To prove Bruce Lee was wrong, he was a fake and a fraud,

316
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,950
字幕
the Chinese traditionalists sent somebody over to fight him.

317
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,890
字幕
The Chinese sent someone to shut down the school.

318
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,150
字幕
Shut down or thrown down, and Bruce chose throw down.

319
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,820
字幕
The fight was to be held at Bruce's school.

320
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,800
字幕
If Bruce lost the fight, he would have to stop teaching non-Chinese people.

321
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,940
字幕
Anything that forces you to review your dogmas,

322
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,190
字幕
most people don't respond too well to it.

323
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,340
字幕
I was there, eight months pregnant with Brandon,

324
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,860
字幕
and these elders arrived from San Francisco,

325
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,470
字幕
led by Wong Jack Man, who was going to be the opponent in this challenge.

326
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,980
字幕
They came and they had this big match.

327
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,160
字幕
I didn't have a shred of a doubt about how this would come out.

328
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,330
字幕
Wong Jack Man started to run around the room trying to get away from Bruce,

329
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,910
字幕
and it took three minutes for Bruce to get him down on the ground

330
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,850
字幕
and say, "Do you give UP?"

331
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,250
字幕
So Wong Jack Man and those people all left.

332
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,640
字幕
And I remember so clearly in my mind's eye

333
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,370
字幕
Bruce sitting on the steps in the back of the studio

334
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,380
字幕
with his head in his hands.

335
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,030
字幕
And she said, "What's the matter?"

336
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,920
字幕
That was the fight that he realised the classical arts were not working for him.

337
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,570
字幕
He should have put that guy down sooner.

338
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,540
字幕
Bruce Lee doesn't beat him fast enough, so he goes off to rethink it all,

339
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,180
字幕
and these tales all had the structure of myth and fantasy.

340
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,040
字幕
Little parables about the master.

341
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,290
字幕
He said, "My training in wing chun, my classical art,

342
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,510
字幕
didn't prepare me for this kind of a battle."

343
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,930
字幕
That was the beginning of the evolution of his own way of martial arts.

344
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,560
字幕
If you read the notes that he left behind, 1965 he starts to write,

345
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,860
字幕
"My style is Western fencing,

346
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,300
字幕
Western boxing and wing chun."

347
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,440
字幕
He said he owe our knowledge to the wing chun,

348
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,000
字幕
but we're gonna go beyond the wing chun.

349
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,170
字幕
Bruce Lee took a lot from boxing.

350
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,440
字幕
He felt boxing was more realistic in that you were trading blows.

351
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,010
字幕
He likes the boxing footwork. It's alive, it's moving and it changes.

352
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,020
字幕
He was totally invested in watching boxing films,

353
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,050
字幕
going way back to Jack Johnson, Gene Tunney, Dempsey.

354
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,060
字幕
What he took from Dempsey was the kinetic chain,

355
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,960
字幕
how to generate power, the importance of a good jab.

356
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,950
字幕
There's a lot about the alignment of the body.

357
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,850
字幕
Bruce had a huge collection of boxing films

358
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,620
字幕
and he thought the world of Muhammad Ali.

359
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,020
字幕
What he would do was very unique. I once came in, lights were all out.

360
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,030
字幕
And he's watching this 8mm film and he's watching it backwards.

361
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,600
字幕
Ali had a left-foot forward stance and Bruce a right foot forward.

362
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,140
字幕
So he would run the films backward in the film editor

363
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,800
字幕
and study them meticulously.

364
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,230
字幕
He would stretch and read

365
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,280
字幕
and review on 8mm film of a boxer at the same time.

366
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,730
字幕
According to John Saxon, his co-star on Enter the Dragon,

367
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,030
字幕
John asked him, "Why do you have all these boxing films on Ali?"

368
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,360
字幕
And Bruce said, "Because one day I'm gonna fight him."

369
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,760
字幕
If I was to fight Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee was so quick, so smooth,

370
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,530
字幕
but the one thing that negates speed on a fighter is pressure,

371
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,960
字幕
and I was a pressure fighter.

372
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,250
字幕
With Bruce Lee, you gotta go inside, smother him

373
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,980
字幕
and outmuscle him. But you can't fight a dude like that outside.

374
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,430
字幕
I see Bruce leading off with some long-ass kicks

375
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,620
字幕
and Boom Boom gets pissed off and tries to give him some body punches.

376
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,770
字幕
And when you get close, then Bruce, I'm sure,

377
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,270
字幕
would be trying to bring knees and high head kicks,

378
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,860
字幕
and I'd throw an upper cut, bring the elbow across.

379
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,740
字幕
And he's gonna be trying to counter me, so I have to bob and weave inside.

380
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,410
字幕
Bruce gets it to the ground and arm-bars him or guillotines him.

381
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,610
字幕
It would have been a good time.

382
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,890
字幕
People are watching this going, "He took more shots than we thought."

383
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,560
字幕
"He absolutely has lost his mind

384
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,520
字幕
thinking he can do that against Bruce Lee."

385
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,120
字幕
Ray was good to the body. Then he'd eventually get that hook on you.

386
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,780
字幕
Bruce wouldn't know how to stop it. Why? Because he never did it.

387
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,930
字幕
People bring up the question: Was Bruce Lee a real fighter?

388
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,990
字幕
Bruce was a brilliant fighter. I saw him beat up a guy on Enter the Dragon.

389
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,340
字幕
It was a gang banger, a tong member, who started giving him a bad time.

390
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,340
字幕
Pound for pound, I think he's probably one of the best fighters.

391
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,460
字幕
He had tons of street fights and with that speed and footwork,

392
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,240
字幕
he'd be a hell of a 135-pounder.

393
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,830
字幕
He was a 130-something-pound lethal weapon.

394
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,900
字幕
He has all the attributes that make a good fighter:

395
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,540
字幕
The agility, the balance, the coordination, the dexterity.

396
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,440
字幕
People say was he the toughest man that ever lived?

397
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,790
字幕
He was 130, 135 pounds.

398
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,780
字幕
You'd grab him and, you know, out the window.

399
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,850
字幕
And that isn't to put him down.

400
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,890
字幕
He was an entertainer, and the best.

401
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,710
字幕
If he wanted to become an MMA fighter today,

402
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,880
字幕
he would easily have been that fighter that everyone fears.

403
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,580
字幕
His technique was beautiful, perfect technique.

404
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,020
字幕
I don't care how good you are, 135lb wrestler,

405
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,860
字幕
you fight Brock Lesnar, you're gonna lose.

406
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,750
字幕
The bigger guy equally trained is always gonna beat the littler guy.

407
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,120
字幕
But the fact is, it wasn't about mass.

408
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,920
字幕
He would just put it down no matter how big you were.

409
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,740
字幕
But, then again, everybody's chin is different, you know?

410
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,440
字幕
Whether Bruce Lee was a great fighter or wasn't a great fighter

411
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,070
字幕
doesn't make any difference to his cultural and historical importance,

412
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,060
字幕
because his films changed the world.

413
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,060
字幕
You got the job on The Green Hornet, where you played Kato, the chauffeur,

414
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,180
字幕
mainly because you're the only Chinese-looking guy

415
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,280
字幕
who could pronounce the name of the leading character, Britt Reid.

416
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,990
字幕
I made that as a joke, of course.

417
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,120
字幕
And it's a heck of a name, man.

418
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,980
字幕
Every time I said it at that time, I was superconscious.

419
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,730
字幕
Mr Reid's residence.

420
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,500
字幕
As a kid, we watched Green Hornet for him.

421
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,560
字幕
We could care less about Green Hornet.

422
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,160
字幕
He had a fly car, I'll give him props for the car,

423
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,490
字幕
but Kato was incredible.

424
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,150
字幕
Everybody in the neighbourhood was fighting to be Bruce Lee,

425
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,210
字幕
not the Green Hornet.

426
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,110
字幕
A lot of stunt guys didn't know how to react.

427
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,190
字幕
You do the old John Wayne, you throw a punch and the guy goes down.

428
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,350
字幕
With him, it's boom, boom, boom, boom, lightning fast.

429
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,320
字幕
There's a shot of Bruce and he's doing a kick,

430
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,480
字幕
and his thigh, his inner thigh, is flat against his chest.

431
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,610
字幕
And we would just look at that kick like, "Are you kidding me?"

432
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,440
字幕
"Look how incredible this guy can kick."

433
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,070
字幕
I think about what my dad said about his first foray into Hollywood.

434
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,340
字幕
There were all these seasoned actors doing their thing,

435
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,040
字幕
and he felt like the only robot in the room.

436
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,450
字幕
That's something I can really relate to in my life, back when I was acting,

437
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,920
字幕
and I was trying so hard to impress the right people.

438
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,550
字幕
When I did The Green Hornet, I was not being myself

439
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,260
字幕
and I'm trying to accumulate external security,

440
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,980
字幕
external technique,

441
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,960
字幕
but never to ask what Bruce Lee would have done.

442
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,470
字幕
The beauty was that he immediately said, "I'm not gonna do that any more."

443
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,340
字幕
Sort of an awakening moment for him.

444
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,440
字幕
By the way, I did a really terrible job in that, I have to say.

445
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,970
字幕
Really? You didn't like yourself? I didn't see it.

446
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,490
字幕
He was always trying to be a holistic person,

447
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,210
字幕
the fight, the philosophy, the better human being.

448
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,480
字幕
Martial art has a very, very deep meaning as far as my life is concerned.

449
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,110
字幕
And he was a very literate guy.

450
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,320
字幕
He really did read

451
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,370
字幕
and really did study and really did think.

452
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,950
字幕
All type of knowledge ultimately means self-knowledge.

453
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:53,070
字幕
He had a huge library of books in his den from the ceiling to the floor.

454
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,520
字幕
Any book I'd pick up, there were notations about what was good,

455
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,430
字幕
what was functional, what was no good.

456
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:03,330
字幕
As an actor, as a martial artist, as a human being,

457
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,100
字幕
all these I have learned from martial art.

458
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,300
字幕
Most of the writings in the Tao of Jeet Kune Do are Western influenced

459
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,490
字幕
and they come directly from fencing and boxing books.

460
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,410
字幕
And you can take most of the passages in that book

461
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,760
字幕
and trace them to their roots, verbatim.

462
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,190
字幕
He might have changed "fighter" from "fencer", but pretty much it's intact.

463
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,280
字幕
People will say, "Hey, that's not Bruce's philosophy."

464
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,630
字幕
"That was this author or that author."

465
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,740
字幕
That doesn't matter. These people are missing the point.

466
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,440
字幕
Bruce Lee's writings are very fun to read, but they were notes.

467
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,530
字幕
You get these quotes where he may change one word

468
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,220
字幕
and substitute jeet kune do for tao.

469
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,720
字幕
So therefore it's not pure naturalness or unnaturalness.

470
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,050
字幕
The ideal is unnatural naturalness or natural unnaturalness.

471
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,390
字幕
- Yin yang. - You're right, man, that's it.

472
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,580
字幕
Because of Bruce Lee, now I read up on Alan Watts.

473
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,390
字幕
JD Krishnamurti, of course Lao Tsu,

474
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,770
字幕
Tao Te Ching.

475
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,640
字幕
Bruce Lee dissected those philosophies,

476
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,490
字幕
making them straight and direct and to the point.

477
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,120
字幕
That's what real philosophy's about,

478
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,020
字幕
something that you can apply to day-to-day living.

479
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,380
字幕
That's what Bruce Lee did.

480
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,350
字幕
This is where he was a genius.

481
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,090
字幕
It might sound too philosophical,

482
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,440
字幕
but it's unacting acting or acting unacting if you...

483
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,300
字幕
- You've lost me. - I have, huh?

484
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,800
字幕
So Bruce Lee as a philosopher introduces nothing new

485
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,380
字幕
but introduces a radicalism into martial art.

486
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,220
字幕
He's speaking the ideology of the counterculture.

487
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
字幕
He speaks the zeitgeist.

488
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,600
字幕
So you get an interest in Buddhism, in yoga, in all things Eastern.

489
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,620
字幕
Bruce Lee shows you meditation in movement.

490
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,180
字幕
You set up a school in Hollywood

491
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,820
字幕
for people like James Garner, Steve McQueen and the others.

492
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,120
字幕
Why would they want to learn Chinese martial art? Because of a movie role?

493
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,180
字幕
Not really.

494
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,340
字幕
Most of them, you see, they are coming in to ask me to teach them

495
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,750
字幕
not so much how to defend themselves,

496
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,170
字幕
they want to learn to express themselves

497
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,530
字幕
through some movement, be it anger,

498
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,410
字幕
be it determination or whatsoever.

499
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,380
字幕
He is paying me to show him in combative form

500
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,070
字幕
the art of expressing the human body.

501
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,440
字幕
Our back yard was always a back yard school,

502
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,070
字幕
so for Jim Coburn to come over

503
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,590
字幕
or Steve McQueen to come over

504
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,890
字幕
was like not that big a deal.

505
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,130
字幕
Of all your students, famous, James Garner, Steve McQueen,

506
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,760
字幕
James Coburn, Roman Polanski, which was the best?

507
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,410
字幕
Depending, OK? Now, as a fighter, Steve McQueen, that son of a gun,

508
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,650
字幕
got the toughness in him.

509
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,330
字幕
Now, James Coburn is a peace-loving man.

510
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,090
字幕
- I've met him. - You've met him.

511
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,170
字幕
He's really, really nice.

512
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,700
字幕
Super mellow and all that, you know what I mean?

513
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,690
字幕
Now, he appreciates the philosophical part of it,

514
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,500
字幕
therefore his understanding of it is deeper than Steve's.

515
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,010
字幕
He often told me, "I would like to see Steve McQueen

516
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,720
字幕
be a little bit more like Coburn

517
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,230
字幕
and Coburn to be a little bit more like Steve McQueen."

518
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,360
字幕
Actually, you see, it's a combination of both.

519
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,680
字幕
I mean, here is the natural instinct and here is control.

520
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,690
字幕
You are to combine the two in harmony.

521
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,020
字幕
Not if you have one to the extreme,

522
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,140
字幕
you will be very unscientific.

523
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,450
字幕
If you have another to the extreme,

524
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,460
字幕
you become all of a sudden a mechanical man.

525
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,850
字幕
All the big, big names in tournament fighting came to Bruce

526
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,860
字幕
because they wanted to refine their skills.

527
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,230
字幕
Joe Lewis, Bob Wall, Chuck Norris.

528
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,520
字幕
Chuck Norris was probably the greatest kicker I've ever seen.

529
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,980
字幕
Chuck Norris is unbelievable.

530
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,730
字幕
Bruce didn't want to teach beginners.

531
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,370
字幕
He did have some in his own schools.

532
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,810
字幕
But he took the top martial artists and he felt he could make them better.

533
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,800
字幕
"One more time. You don't get it, we move to something else."

534
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,890
字幕
"You gonna get it?" That's how he would teach.

535
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,500
字幕
He knew a lot. He taught me gung fu.

536
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,130
字幕
Joe Lewis was highly influenced by Bruce Lee.

537
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,210
字幕
Joe Lewis was a world champion when he met Bruce,

538
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,010
字幕
but it was a lot more of Bruce being the instructor to Joe.

539
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,170
字幕
I don't think he had boxing hands until he met Bruce Lee,

540
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,140
字幕
but his side kick was phenomenal.

541
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,300
字幕
Joe would throw 1,000 side kicks a day.

542
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,620
字幕
Listen, Joe Lewis, in today's world, he would have learned all that shit

543
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,540
字幕
and been just as bad as he was back in the day.

544
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,170
字幕
Bruce didn't think point karate, point martial arts competition,

545
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,820
字幕
was valuable at all, and I totally disagreed with him.

546
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,530
字幕
Bruce watched it but didn't believe in it.

547
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,060
字幕
He always advocated full-contact sparring.

548
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,280
字幕
Bruce Lee looked at all of that and said, "This is not martial arts."

549
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,750
字幕
"This is nonsense. Let's get rid of these rules."

550
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,640
字幕
I respect that he didn't feel like he wanted to compete

551
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,120
字幕
because it wasn't real combat.

552
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,640
字幕
He says you're not fighting for yourself or expressing yourself.

553
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,370
字幕
You're fighting for the judges, the referee, the rules.

554
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,740
字幕
What's the reality of combat? There's someone who wants to beat you down.

555
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,860
字幕
He said to learn to swim, you cannot swim on land.

556
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,480
字幕
You gotta get in the water.

557
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,810
字幕
To learn to fight, you gotta fight.

558
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,720
字幕
Can you break five or six pieces of wood with your hand or your foot?

559
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,740
字幕
Boards don't hit back.

560
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,720
字幕
I'll probably break my hand and foot.

561
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,660
字幕
He had high regard for those martial artists of the day

562
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,350
字幕
that were winning tournaments.

563
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:20,780
字幕
He just had a different philosophy about martial arts and actual fighting.

564
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,690
字幕
I do not believe in styles any more.

565
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,550
字幕
I mean, I do not believe that there is such thing

566
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,150
字幕
as like a Chinese way of fighting

567
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,370
字幕
or the Japanese way of fighting or whatever way of fighting.

568
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,370
字幕
Because if you don't have styles,

569
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,200
字幕
if you just say, "Well, here I am, you know, as a human being,

570
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,540
字幕
how can I express myself totally and completely?"

571
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,380
字幕
Now, that way, you won't create a style, because style is a crystallisation.

572
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,290
字幕
I mean, that way it's a process of continuing growth.

573
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,210
字幕
He called his institute Jun Fan Gung Fu.

574
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,670
字幕
We were riding in a car and he mentioned what he enjoyed in fencing

575
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,110
字幕
was the stop hit.

576
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,650
字幕
Bruce didn't have any passive blocks. His blocks were a strike.

577
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,730
字幕
Bruce took the stances from the stances that you see in Western fencing.

578
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,200
字幕
Instead of just block and then hit, it's done simultaneously.

579
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,120
字幕
He says we wanna intercept his physical motion and his thought.

580
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,190
字幕
It's almost like fencing. You see this capture? That's the capture.

581
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,430
字幕
And that's why he said, "I'm gonna call my new method the intercepting way

582
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,540
字幕
or the intercepting fist."

583
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,650
字幕
Come on, touch me. Any way you can.

584
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,380
字幕
To reach me, you must move to me.

585
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,440
字幕
Your attack offers me an opportunity to intercept you.

586
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,740
字幕
And they said, "What do you call that?"

587
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,100
字幕
He says, "We call thatjeet kune do."

588
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,070
字幕
In Cantonese, jeet kune do.

589
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,230
字幕
Then it was Dan who says, "Acronym would be JKD."

590
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,010
字幕
And Bruce Lee said, "I like that."

591
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,360
字幕
- The way of the intercepting fist. - Intercepting fist?

592
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,030
字幕
It sounds Chinese, but it's very much an American martial art.

593
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,430
字幕
Jeet kune do was how can I most efficiently

594
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,860
字幕
directly end a moment of combat?

595
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,200
字幕
The philosophy Bruce Lee had was:

596
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,050
字幕
The simpler the better, the most effective, the direct line.

597
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,610
字幕
- The other stuff was Hollywood. - It can be taught.

598
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,880
字幕
- Do you understand? - But it cannot really be standardised.

599
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,090
字幕
And that's not to say that it can't be passed on.

600
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,160
字幕
But it was very personal to him.

601
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,720
字幕
All the wannabes, all the imposters

602
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,930
字幕
who put up jeet kune do signs on their school building,

603
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,730
字幕
and they have no idea whatjeet kune do is.

604
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,890
字幕
They think it's a style.

605
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,290
字幕
I don't know if he'd be dojo-busting in his days, but that would upset Bruce.

606
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,900
字幕
Bruce Lee has the big middle finger raised toward any form of authority.

607
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,750
字幕
All kinds of dogmas, all kinds of traditions.

608
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,660
字幕
He's saying a big "screw you" to all of them.

609
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,570
字幕
This guy was preaching back in the '60s you shouldn't stay to one style.

610
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,120
字幕
No one style is the best. Have a piece of everything.

611
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,680
字幕
In 1968 he says, "JKD in '69 will be different."

612
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,680
字幕
I said, "This is really good stuff we're doing now."

613
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,200
字幕
He says, "JKD in '69 will be different. JKD in 1970 will be different."

614
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,320
字幕
Martial arts has evolved more in the last ten years

615
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,730
字幕
than it has in the last 10,000 years,

616
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,380
字幕
because all the stuff that Bruce Lee talked about

617
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,950
字幕
and his philosophies and things that he believed were finally proven

618
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,940
字幕
and now this new martial art was able to start to grow and evolve.

619
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,770
字幕
Our main event, for the light heavyweight title,

620
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,100
字幕
here we go!

621
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,600
字幕
You talk about Chinese boxing. How does it differ from, say, our kind of boxing?

622
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,980
字幕
Well, first we use the feet.

623
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,590
字幕
Second to none.

624
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,260
字幕
And then we use the elbow.

625
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,550
字幕
Oh! Beautiful elbow!

626
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,970
字幕
- Do you use the thumb too? - You name it, man, we use it.

627
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,760
字幕
- You use it all. - You have to.

628
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,350
字幕
Because that is the expression of the human body.

629
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,730
字幕
I mean, the... everything, I mean, not just the hand.

630
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,860
字幕
The crazy thing about martial arts is people debate and fight over this stuff.

631
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,820
字幕
There's no debate.

632
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,850
字幕
Bruce Lee is definitely the father of mixed martial arts.

633
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,100
字幕
I do think there's a correlation there,

634
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,170
字幕
but it's not that jeet kune do is the same thing as MMA.

635
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,020
字幕
If Dana White says Bruce Lee is the father of mixed martial arts,

636
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,820
字幕
I would say he's one of the earliest ones,

637
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,770
字幕
but Gene LeBell is the father of mixed martial arts.

638
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,980
字幕
In 1963 you'll see Gene defeating Milo Savage, a professional boxer.

639
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,590
字幕
Well, Bruce wasn't into mixed martial arts in 1963.

640
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,350
字幕
As I was choking him, he grabbed my hand and started to bite,

641
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,040
字幕
and I said, "Milo, you bite my hand, I'm gonna take your eye out."

642
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,130
字幕
He opened his mouth, I pulled my hand out and I choked him.

643
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,240
字幕
And he was out, like, for 22 minutes.

644
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,000
字幕
Gene LeBell taught Bruce Lee grappling moves.

645
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,990
字幕
I'd throw him and flip him and he'd land on his feet.

646
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,700
字幕
Then he'd spin, do a crescent kick on me

647
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,070
字幕
or do a judo throw.

648
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,950
字幕
And he was a magnificent athlete.

649
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,570
字幕
If you're gonna say father of mixed martial... it's gotta be Bruce.

650
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,800
字幕
He's before anyone else.

651
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,340
字幕
He's the first one who decided to put it all together.

652
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,040
字幕
He had the little shorts on, too.

653
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,810
字幕
That's as close as he could get to what the UFC and the MMA was 25 years later.

654
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,160
字幕
In 1947, kajukenbo was the first

655
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,840
字幕
to put all these different martial arts in one title:

656
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,630
字幕
Karate, judo, kenpo, boxing.

657
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,160
字幕
Like Bruce Lee, they put all these practical things together

658
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,980
字幕
but kajukenbo had it first.

659
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,370
字幕
I agree with Dana White.

660
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,850
字幕
He is one of the pioneers of mixed martial art.

661
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:48,520
字幕
The reality is, everybody has been a part of this evolution,

662
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,570
字幕
from Benny "the Jet" Urquidez to Joe Lewis to all these guys,

663
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,990
字幕
to Joe Lewis the boxer, too, and the list goes on and on and on.

664
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,980
字幕
When the UFC came in, they weren't talking about Bruce Lee.

665
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,850
字幕
They were talking about Royce Gracie.

666
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,370
字幕
Royce Gracie!

667
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:09,390
字幕
The Gracies were a piece of that too, a piece of the history of not only the UFC

668
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,380
字幕
but of the martial arts evolving.

669
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,000
字幕
For a while they owned those competitions.

670
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,360
字幕
There's the tag.

671
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,770
字幕
What the Gracies did was they took the ground game, the submission game,

672
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,850
字幕
and really refined it to a whole other level.

673
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,860
字幕
Bruce would have loved Brazilian jiujitsu.

674
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,420
字幕
I think if he saw the Gracies, he would have studied.

675
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,350
字幕
He really embraced wrestling and he really embraced judo.

676
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,790
字幕
The difference between the Gracies and Bruce Lee

677
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,520
字幕
is Bruce Lee was never stuck and married to one thing.

678
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,550
字幕
I think once everybody started to learn jiujitsu

679
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,590
字幕
and then people started to do more stand-up in there...

680
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,380
字幕
My goodness!

681
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,420
字幕
Then I think they started talking about Bruce Lee.

682
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,000
字幕
Oh, man. That is the Karate Kid.

683
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,190
字幕
And when you're talking about combat...

684
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,970
字幕
Well, I mean, if it is a sport, now you're talking about something else.

685
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,780
字幕
You have regulations. You have rules.

686
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,540
字幕
But when you're talking about fighting as it is...

687
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,030
字幕
- No rules? - With no rules.

688
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,690
字幕
Real fighting.

689
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,100
字幕
Well, then, baby, you'd better train every part of your body.

690
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,220
字幕
Mixed martial art in the cage is for a contest. It's a sport.

691
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,090
字幕
I don't know that I would call him exactly the father of mixed martial arts

692
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,190
字幕
because, again, it is still sport, there are still rules.

693
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,460
字幕
Bruce Lee was strictly for the street, taking guys out, not for competition.

694
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,330
字幕
When they had these Vale Tudo fights in Brazil, there were barely any rules.

695
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,080
字幕
You could head-butt, you could kick in the groin, all kinds of things.

696
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,060
字幕
Bruce's favourite weapon in the street fight was the fingerjab.

697
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,240
字幕
This hand would block the vision, so when he came up, like that.

698
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,740
字幕
If you do that, it could be very serious damage to his vision for life.

699
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,120
字幕
Mixed martial art is the purest form of combat

700
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,430
字幕
that you can possibly have in civilisation.

701
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,040
字幕
Oh! With a kick.

702
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,350
字幕
I just always felt like it was such a real raw sport

703
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,030
字幕
and that it was gonna overtake boxing one day.

704
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,470
字幕
It seems like that day's here.

705
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,540
字幕
Let's fight!

706
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,890
字幕
It's the most hardcore real form of competition and honesty I could find,

707
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,670
字幕
and that's the kind of thing I crave.

708
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,670
字幕
Carano, a big-time puncher.

709
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,020
字幕
There is fear. Sometimes you don't wanna go in there.

710
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,390
字幕
It just teaches you to face the music,

711
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,730
字幕
that fear's something that needs to be devoured.

712
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,810
字幕
My biggest fear is not that I'm gonna get hurt.

713
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,060
字幕
Carano getting pounded!

714
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,760
字幕
My biggest fear is that I'm not going to be able to make it authentic

715
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,780
字幕
and honestly express myself.

716
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,830
字幕
You're not trying to express yourself in real fighting. You're trying to survive.

717
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,630
字幕
And you ask yourself how can you honestly express yourself

718
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,530
字幕
at that moment?

719
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,700
字幕
If I want to punch, I'm gonna do it, man, and I'm gonna do it.

720
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,740
字幕
Not you want to punch because you're trying to avoid getting hit

721
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,130
字幕
but to really be in with it and express yourself.

722
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,300
字幕
So that is the type of thing you have to train yourself into it,

723
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,410
字幕
to become one with the...

724
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,720
字幕
This might sound different.

725
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,040
字幕
I feel as if I'm helping people as I'm punching them in the face.

726
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,690
字幕
- Shogun's badly hurt. - Jon Jones!

727
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,000
字幕
I'm beating weakness out of them, making them a better person.

728
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,100
字幕
In my opinion it's the highest art of expression

729
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,040
字幕
and that's what honestly expressing yourself is.

730
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,440
字幕
To the body.

731
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,770
字幕
And it is all over!

732
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,370
字幕
Jon Jones, look, guys like this,

733
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,820
字幕
it's important for them to have this kind of confidence.

734
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,610
字幕
I don't look at it as if I'm hurting my opponent, my enemy.

735
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,480
字幕
It's like we're brothers painting this picture together.

736
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,180
字幕
It helps them, until, of course, it doesn't,

737
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,940
字幕
which, as we know historically, always happens,

738
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,460
字幕
where they run into that guy where, "Oh, this isn't fun."

739
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,790
字幕
"This is reality. You can get hurt in there."

740
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,940
字幕
What happens is after several years of that,

741
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,200
字幕
it takes its effect, you know?

742
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,970
字幕
Like when I had to go take my neurological

743
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,160
字幕
and my hands were going,

744
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,000
字幕
and I couldn't remember where I parked my car in the morning.

745
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,560
字幕
It should be regulated. There should be judges and medical staff there.

746
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,950
字幕
You don't wanna see people get injured.

747
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,050
字幕
I think my father, from a pure martial arts interest

748
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,330
字幕
and combat interest standpoint, would have loved to watch the UFC.

749
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,040
字幕
I believe that Bruce Lee was a huge fight fan.

750
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,910
字幕
He'd have been jumping out of his seat, getting as excited as any of us.

751
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,840
字幕
I think he'd have been proud to be called the father of mixed martial arts.

752
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,810
字幕
OK, there's people out there, they got it.

753
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,200
字幕
They say that Bruce Lee was the father of mixed martial arts.

754
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,490
字幕
That bothers me.

755
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,870
字幕
If he's the father of mixed martial arts,

756
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,300
字幕
I'm the grandfather of mixed martial arts,

757
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,770
字幕
And if you don't believe me, I'll choke you,

758
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,320
字幕
cos you got a nice neck for choking.

759
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,750
字幕
When you get into this whole martial arts thing

760
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,610
字幕
and you start talking about Bruce Lee, a lot of people get offended.

761
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,620
字幕
People get pissed off and bombed out and everything else.

762
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,100
字幕
But Bruce Lee is 100 percent the father of mixed martial arts.

763
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:13,970
字幕
He was so directed and so concrete about his thoughts and his beliefs

764
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,990
字幕
that he actually went out and had his friend George

765
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,430
字幕
make a little miniature tombstone.

766
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,310
字幕
It's really heavy and it says, "In memory of a once fluid man

767
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,970
字幕
crammed and distorted by the classical mess."

768
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,300
字幕
The classical mess meant that all these traditions were a classical mess.

769
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,570
字幕
"Right punch comes. I'll move out to a 30-degree angle."

770
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:37,330
字幕
"Then I'll bend my..." It's too complicated.

771
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,940
字幕
It's not gonna work in real life.

772
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,460
字幕
So here was this tombstone he created

773
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,470
字幕
to essentially remind himself to go back to fluidity.

774
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,890
字幕
Bruce had a vast library of motivational books

775
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,540
字幕
and wrote motivational thoughts every day

776
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,130
字幕
and had a little diary that he kept every day.

777
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,620
字幕
Always they would say you've got to have the plan and work the plan

778
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,160
字幕
and write down your goals, which he did.

779
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,960
字幕
You know, his famous paper he wrote, My Definite Chief Aim.

780
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:41,230
字幕
1969 was a very difficult time for him.

781
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,560
字幕
A lot of things were going through his life.

782
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,710
字幕
As I recall, money was short.

783
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:51,100
字幕
Bruce was very traditionalist and very ashamed that I had to go to work.

784
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,880
字幕
This was not in his way of thinking.

785
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:58,000
字幕
He contemplated maybe going back to Hong Kong at that time period.

786
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,650
字幕
And then in the summer of '69 these horrific murders happened.

787
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,430
字幕
We have a weird homicide.

788
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,720
字幕
When the Manson murders happened, it was horrible, it was horrifying.

789
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,750
字幕
The scene described by one investigator

790
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,280
字幕
as reminiscent of a weird religious rite.

791
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,060
字幕
Bruce was a very good friend of Jay Sebring and of Sharon Tate.

792
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,350
字幕
Five persons, including actress Sharon Tate, were found dead

793
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,740
字幕
at the home of Miss Tate and her husband, screen director Roman Polanski.

794
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,560
字幕
My father worked with Sharon Tate the summer before the murders

795
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,750
字幕
on the film The Wrecking Crew.

796
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,170
字幕
Miss Tate was eight months pregnant.

797
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,380
字幕
Among the other victims were Hollywood hair stylist Jay Sebring...

798
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,960
字幕
Jay Sebring introduced my father to William Dozier,

799
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,730
字幕
who was the producer of Batman and also produced The Green Hornet.

800
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,690
字幕
The murders were then followed up the very next night by more murders.

801
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:57,070
字幕
It was just a nightmare and very scary for Bruce, too,

802
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:01,920
字幕
because Bruce's whole mentality was protection, to take care of us.

803
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,730
字幕
One officer summed up the murders:

804
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:09,130
字幕
"In all my years I have never seen anything like this before."

805
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,230
字幕
Those were tough times, going out of the '60s and into the '70s.

806
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:21,290
字幕
And every day, I practise martial arts.

807
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,240
字幕
We were really struggling financially to make it,

808
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,110
字幕
and we had bought our first house which we ended up not being able to afford.

809
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,270
字幕
And right in the middle of that he hurt his back.

810
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,930
字幕
He was doing a good morning stretch exercise which can be very dangerous.

811
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,910
字幕
Chiropractors like that exercise.

812
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,220
字幕
- You see? - Watch out.

813
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,810
字幕
For whatever reason, he did not warm up and just... that was it.

814
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,680
字幕
He was in excruciating pain.

815
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,360
字幕
I said, "Where's Bruce?" They never wanted to say he hurt his back,

816
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,120
字幕
because I knew he was working on the screen scripts.

817
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,770
字幕
They told him that he was never going to walk properly,

818
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,200
字幕
and forget doing any gung fu.

819
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,860
字幕
On the back of his business card he wrote the words "Walk on".

820
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:05,080
字幕
He used to put the card on his bathroom mirror and his doors and walls,

821
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,200
字幕
so everywhere he went in his room, he'd see "Walk on".

822
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,580
字幕
So he'd get down and start doing his stretching.

823
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,420
字幕
Bruce brought himself back through rigorous rehabilitation.

824
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,110
字幕
I had a similar expression

825
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,770
字幕
when I would drive down to Torrance to do my jiujitsu class every week.

826
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,900
字幕
His expression was "Walk on" and mine was "Walk in the front door".

827
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,650
字幕
I had every excuse on the way down to go back.

828
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,720
字幕
My stomach hurts. My arm hurts. My knee's aching.

829
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,500
字幕
And I used to say, "Walk in the front door. Walk in the front door."

830
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,980
字幕
The end result of walking in that front door 16 years was I got my black belt,

831
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,490
字幕
which I consider the greatest achievement of my life,

832
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,680
字幕
apart from my children.

833
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:46,560
字幕
The back problem was a constant problem in his filming

834
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,340
字幕
from day one after the injury.

835
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,340
字幕
Something he had to be careful about

836
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:54,360
字幕
and nurse each day when he finished working.

837
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:59,020
字幕
And you push it out, but all the time you are keeping the continuity going.

838
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,930
字幕
Bending, stretching.

839
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,400
字幕
He worked extremely hard.

840
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,890
字幕
Most of us, I think, don't know what it is to work that hard.

841
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,400
字幕
My father went to India

842
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,410
字幕
with James Coburn and the writer Stirling Silliphant.

843
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,760
字幕
They were scouting locations for a film, The Silent Flute,

844
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,970
字幕
that my father had written the treatment for

845
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:24,690
字幕
that he was really hoping would come together,

846
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,590
字幕
because he was struggling at that point in time to get a project going.

847
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,550
字幕
The Silent Flute could have blasted Bruce into Hollywood big time.

848
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,870
字幕
This was going to be the big breakthrough project.

849
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:39,350
字幕
This was going to put money in the bank to pay the mortgage and all that.

850
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,530
字幕
But they couldn't find the locations that they wanted.

851
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,940
字幕
Stirling and Jim came back to Warner Bros

852
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,910
字幕
and said, "This is just not what we're looking for in location."

853
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,190
字幕
And then it all came crashing down.

854
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,510
字幕
That was such a disappointment to Bruce

855
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,740
字幕
because we were banking on it, literally.

856
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,020
字幕
Bruce took a trip back to Hong Kong to help his mom

857
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,150
字幕
with immigration into the United States.

858
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,150
字幕
He took Brandon took with him. Brandon was five years old.

859
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,520
字幕
He wasn't working, had no money. He dropped everything.

860
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,640
字幕
Closed his schools. "I'm going to Hong Kong."

861
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,940
字幕
The Green Hornet was at that time showing on TV in Hong Kong,

862
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,180
字幕
only the people were calling it The Kato Show.

863
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,060
字幕
They didn't care about Van Williams. He was the biggest thing there.

864
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,830
字幕
He was greeted there as a returning star.

865
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,850
字幕
That was the first time he thought, "Wow. People recognise me here."

866
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,050
字幕
"They remember me."

867
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,780
字幕
He did a couple of interviews on television shows.

868
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,080
字幕
Oh, yeah, that kid. Now he's a big star in Hollywood.

869
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,440
字幕
So that was the first inkling

870
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,720
字幕
that maybe there would be a future there in Hong Kong.

871
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,220
字幕
But he wasn't quite ready to follow up on that.

872
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,340
字幕
Bruce Lee had a bit part, or a supporting role,

873
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,480
字幕
in the Longstreet series.

874
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,800
字幕
And this had an enormous effect on the audience. What was it?

875
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,320
字幕
I think the successful ingredient in it

876
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,040
字幕
was because I was being Bruce Lee.

877
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,850
字幕
- Yourself? - Myself, right.

878
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,340
字幕
And did that part, just expressed myself, like I say,

879
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,510
字幕
honestly expressed myself at that time.

880
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,920
字幕
He was very proud of Longstreet, and it was very much from him

881
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,790
字幕
and his art and his thoughts.

882
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:41,330
字幕
Can you remember the lines by Stirling Silliphant to...

883
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,250
字幕
- He's one of my students. - Was he, too?

884
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,300
字幕
- Yes. - You've had everybody as your student.

885
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,090
字幕
But some lines there expressed your philosophy.

886
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,360
字幕
- I don't know if you remember them. - I remember.

887
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,090
字幕
I said... This is what it is, OK?

888
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,200
字幕
If you try to remember, you will lose.

889
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,060
字幕
I said empty your mind.

890
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,570
字幕
Be formless, shapeless.

891
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,890
字幕
Like water.

892
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:06,860
字幕
Now, you put water into a cup,

893
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,870
字幕
it becomes the cup.

894
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,170
字幕
Put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.

895
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,290
字幕
You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

896
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,330
字幕
Now, water can flow or creep or drip or crash.

897
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,600
字幕
Be water, my friend.

898
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,840
字幕
- Like that. You see? - I see. I get the idea.

899
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,270
字幕
- A-ha. - I get the power behind it.

900
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,080
字幕
The thing that I got off him the most is the trust,

901
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,320
字幕
being able to trust your abilities in each situation.

902
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,340
字幕
A lot of times the game becomes too scripted.

903
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,920
字幕
When it's too scripted

904
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,700
字幕
and you start planning for certain things to take place,

905
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,660
字幕
that's when I believe you're weak.

906
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,030
字幕
What he's saying is that you have to adapt

907
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,000
字幕
to your surroundings, your environment.

908
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,030
字幕
James Coburn said, "Look, man, the best thing you can do,

909
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:55,500
字幕
go back to Hong Kong, do what you do best, come back, rock the world."

910
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,840
字幕
James Coburn did tell Bruce that he shouldn't keep doing TV,

911
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,060
字幕
that it would eat up his genius.

912
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,910
字幕
He had much more to offer the world and he should hold out for starring roles.

913
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,760
字幕
Jimi Hendrix had to break away and go to England to be recognised

914
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,730
字幕
as the rock star that he was.

915
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,130
字幕
Clint Eastwood, he had a career out of Rawhide,

916
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,360
字幕
but it was the Italian Westerns that really made his career.

917
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,960
字幕
Bruce ultimately had to go back to Hong Kong

918
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,560
字幕
to be recognised as the movie star he was.

919
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,490
字幕
Here's a plane ticket. Just go back to Hong Kong for a few years.

920
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,550
字幕
You wouldn't want any trouble, huh?

921
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,490
字幕
That's one of the things I admire most about him.

922
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,660
字幕
He said, "OK, the institution's not gonna work for me."

923
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,240
字幕
"I'll figure something else out."

924
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,810
字幕
He just went to through back door.

925
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,910
字幕
Bruce made the first two pictures with independent producer Raymond Chow

926
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,910
字幕
for $15,000 each.

927
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:01,570
字幕
That was... It was made in Thailand in a small village in Thailand.

928
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,500
字幕
Bruce Lee plays a working-class hero.

929
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,930
字幕
He's from the land. He's one of the folk.

930
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,530
字幕
But at the same time as that, he's never one of the guys.

931
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,770
字幕
And this is why it was so successful, as well as the brilliant choreography.

932
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:20,050
字幕
Bruce Lee completely changed the way action scenes look today in cinema.

933
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,720
字幕
It's about making violence look beautiful,

934
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,660
字幕
which may sound like a paradox, it probably is,

935
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,710
字幕
but a director like John Woo, he shoots a gunfight like martial arts.

936
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:34,420
字幕
It's a ballet. In terms of the craft of filmmaking, that's a huge change.

937
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,980
字幕
But the Western movies really piss me off. They chop 'em up so much.

938
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,200
字幕
Most of the scenes overzoom, so you can't see what's going on.

939
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,890
字幕
Those guys have to go back and watch Bruce Lee movies.

940
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,430
字幕
You can see these awesome moves he's doing in their entirety.

941
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,930
字幕
You can have a shot that doesn't have to last only a half-second long.

942
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,760
字幕
I never even thought about it until I did this movie Haywire.

943
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,780
字幕
Now every time I see a movie, I'm like, "Stop cutting away."

944
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,290
字幕
"Oh, that's a stunt double."

945
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,860
字幕
They were wonderful to watch. No wires, no gimmicks, no quick cuts.

946
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,630
字幕
You get an actor to portray that, you're gonna have to do quick cuts.

947
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,220
字幕
Bruce Lee set a new baseline.

948
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,650
字幕
Every piece of film fight choreography has been influenced by Bruce Lee,

949
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,450
字幕
whether the people involved know it or not.

950
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,120
字幕
- A motion picture is motion. - Yeah.

951
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,550
字幕
I mean, you gotta keep the dialogue down.

952
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,140
字幕
We came over to Hong Kong

953
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,470
字幕
and that was when they showed the premiere of The Big Boss.

954
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,680
字幕
The theatre was packed.

955
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,700
字幕
Bruce and I sat there towards the back.

956
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,890
字幕
When Bruce Lee's first movie showed in Hollywood,

957
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:42,170
字幕
I was so elated, I was so emotional,

958
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,810
字幕
seeing my friend, my teacher, on the screen.

959
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,030
字幕
When the movie finishes, it is so quiet...

960
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,410
字幕
you could hear a pin drop.

961
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,420
字幕
And Bruce is like, "Oh, no. They hate it." You know.

962
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,220
字幕
And all of a sudden...

963
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,390
字幕
a huge roar goes up.

964
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:10,710
字幕
And they're cheering and laughing and clapping. It was wonderful.

965
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,570
字幕
Every time he came on and did his fight scene, everybody applauded.

966
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,390
字幕
That's when we knew he was a movie star now.

967
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:21,640
字幕
And then they started to spot Bruce in the audience.

968
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,040
字幕
They carried him out on their shoulders.

969
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,820
字幕
Oh, it was thrilling. It was thrilling to him.

970
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,310
字幕
"Finally I have been appreciated in my work."

971
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:40,730
字幕
It was wonderful, a very high moment in his life.

972
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,260

It's The Pierre Berton Show,

973
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,800
字幕
the programme that comes to you from the major capitals of the world.

974
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,670
字幕
This edition comes to you from Hong Kong.

975
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,480
字幕
And Pierre's guest, the newest Mandarin superstar.

976
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,650
字幕
His name is Bruce Lee and he doesn't even speak Mandarin.

977
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,970
字幕
Here's Pierre.

978
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,180
字幕
There's a pretty good chance

979
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,220
字幕
that you'll get a TV series in the States called The Warrior

980
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,220
字幕
in which you use, what, the martial arts in a Western setting?

981
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,410
字幕
That was the original idea.

982
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,030
字幕
Bruce Lee had an idea for a TV show called The Warrior,

983
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,550
字幕
which later became the series Kung Fu, which we all know and love.

984
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,240
字幕
David Carradine did a good job,

985
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,490
字幕
but Kung Fu, the TV series, was Bruce Lee's role.

986
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:25,400
字幕
The better guy doesn't always get the job in the movie business.

987
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,690
字幕
There's a lot of politics involved.

988
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,870
字幕
Have people come up in the industry and said,

989
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,670
字幕
"We don't know how the audience are going to take a non-American?"

990
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,440
字幕
Well, such question has been raised.

991
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,770
字幕
In fact, it is being discussed,

992
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:44,320
字幕
and that is why The Warrior probably is not gonna be on.

993
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,480
字幕
- I see. - You see?

994
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,870
字幕
Because unfortunately such thing does exist in this world.

995
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:55,310
字幕
Bruce Lee was a bigger star, both in Asia and America.

996
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:58,110
字幕
He was a world-class martial artist.

997
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,970
字幕
He had already done The Green Hornet.

998
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:03,080
字幕
And then he did not get the role for being too Asian.

999
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,650
字幕
He had such disdain for Hollywood

1000
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,490
字幕
and all those old movies

1001
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:13,660
字幕
having Caucasian people play the parts of Chinese characters.

1002
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,020
字幕
I have already made up my mind

1003
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:24,210
字幕
that in the United States I think something about the Oriental,

1004
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:28,850
字幕
I mean, the true Oriental, should be shown.

1005
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,940
字幕
- Hollywood sure as heck hasn't. - You better believe it, man.

1006
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,860
字幕
It's always the pigtail and bouncing around, chop-chop,

1007
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,060
字幕
with the eyes slanted and all of that.

1008
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,490
字幕
There's nothing worse in a movie than when all of a sudden

1009
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,450
字幕
some horrific stereotype shows up.

1010
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,810
字幕
You're like, "Why? Just leave us out. Just leave us out."

1011
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,600
字幕
"We'd rather not exist in your world

1012
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,110
字幕
than exist in your world in some buffoonery coonery."

1013
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,740
字幕
He had a lot of celebrity students

1014
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,910
字幕
and he was teaching them philosophy and martial arts,

1015
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,420
字幕
so he sold them.

1016
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,050
字幕
But when it came down to it for Bruce and Hollywood, they didn't get it.

1017
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:04,650
字幕
They didn't take the time to know who Bruce was.

1018
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,880
字幕
This was his struggle.

1019
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,150
字幕
You want to get ahead?

1020
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,880
字幕
Here you have a bright future, if you apply yourself.

1021
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:11,950
字幕
I will, sir.

1022
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:15,260
字幕
Hollywood was a terrible disappointment to him,

1023
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,920
字幕
especially because then you throw in the racial factor as well,

1024
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,380
字幕
that studios did not want to back a major Chinese star.

1025
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,830
字幕
Asian stereotypes for women are pretty bad. For men it's much worse.

1026
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,590
字幕
And I think he was railing against that his whole life.

1027
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:34,740
字幕
When that little thing of disrespect crept into my life again,

1028
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,560
字幕
which was the movie business, I got really angry.

1029
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,370
字幕
It is kind of shocking, isn't it, that that much time, 40 years,

1030
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:48,110
字幕
has passed and there hasn't been one Asian-American romantic lead,

1031
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:53,620
字幕
or even just a movie star on that scale, an Asian-American movie star?

1032
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,940
字幕
Not one.

1033
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:01,650
字幕
I don't think

1034
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:06,150
字幕
I could name an Asian romantic lead male.

1035
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:10,720
字幕
There hasn't really been anyone since my uncle here, particularly in Hollywood.

1036
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,580
字幕
Obviously out of China you have Jet Li, you have Donnie Yen.

1037
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:20,880
字幕
There have been no great Asian male leads in Hollywood who are sexy.

1038
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,950
字幕
Er, a lead male, Asian-American?

1039
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,170
字幕
Erm...

1040
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:30,290
字幕
I don't even look at him as being Asian. He's like Bruce Lee. He's like my idol.

1041
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,090
字幕
And that's something I guess I don't think of so much, but I guess, yeah.

1042
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,520
字幕
A Chinese nationalist

1043
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,290
字幕
watching Bruce Lee films will see Chinese nationalism.

1044
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,160
字幕
A white Westerner may not even notice the ethnicity.

1045
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,930
字幕
Maybe Dean Cain, right?

1046
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,560
字幕
Isn't he part Asian?

1047
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,270
字幕
At certain times there were prejudices against my skin,

1048
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,030
字幕
but I never let it bother me, because in the back of my mind I used to think,

1049
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,710
字幕
"I'll take care out in the parking lot and I'll beat your head in."

1050
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:02,460
字幕
Bruce Lee became a complete star making films in his own country.

1051
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,620
字幕
40 years later, things haven't changed.

1052
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,910
字幕
So if you wanna see another star like that,

1053
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,650
字幕
it has to happen in films made outside of the system.

1054
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,730
字幕
My first memory of Bruce Lee is in the movie Chinese Connection.

1055
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,990
字幕
The last scene in the movie there's a firing squad.

1056
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,040
字幕
When he came out and ran up and jumped and they froze it.

1057
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:32,130
字幕
I was like, "Mom, what happened?"

1058
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,780
字幕
And she said, "He wanted to go that way."

1059
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,610
字幕
And that just... that just stuck with me.

1060
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,490
字幕
If you look at Chinese Connection,

1061
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,730
字幕
it's a movie about cultural nationalism,

1062
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:51,040
字幕
as expressed through action sequences, but that's no different than Swan Lake.

1063
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,520
字幕
There's no difference between a ballet and a kung fu movie,

1064
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,870
字幕
expressing the ideas and the emotion through movement.

1065
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,820
字幕
When the Japanese bring the sick man of Asia framed picture,

1066
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:09,540
字幕
this is speaking to a long period of Chinese suppression and subordination

1067
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,300
字幕
that was within living memory of those 1970s Hong Kong Bruce Lee films.

1068
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,000
字幕
If you play the film with the dubbed English

1069
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,140
字幕
and then in the original Cantonese,

1070
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,710
字幕
you see that they're essentially different films.

1071
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:27,150
字幕
So, for example, one of the characters goes up to Mr Wu, the translator,

1072
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,530
字幕
and in the English dubbed version he says:

1073
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,860
字幕
Look, here, now what's the point of this?

1074
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,630
字幕
The translator goes:

1075
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,840
字幕
In the Cantonese version he says:

1076
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,540
字幕
So in the English version he's not Chinese,

1077
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:55,750
字幕
but in the subtitled Cantonese version, he says, "Yes, I'm Chinese,

1078
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,520
字幕
but I've chosen to go with the Japanese, the powerful."

1079
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,290
字幕
So there's a world of difference.

1080
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,970
字幕
We're consuming different films

1081
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,210
字幕
depending on the nature of the decisions they make in translating.

1082
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,640
字幕
Westerners have thought that they're slapstick,

1083
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,590
字幕
but the Chinese audience are watching highly politically charged films

1084
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,990
字幕
with quite recent history, animosities and resentments coursing through them.

1085
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:20,330
字幕
Now, you listen to me, and I'll only say it once.

1086
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,340
字幕
We are not sick men.

1087
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,480
字幕
What he gave was so real and so raw

1088
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,810
字幕
because he lived it every day of his life.

1089
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:32,120
字幕
Bruce did not get along well with the director of the first two films, Lo Wei.

1090
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,750
字幕
Lo Wei thought that he could put his thumb on Bruce

1091
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,480
字幕
as one of his simple actors.

1092
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,980
字幕
Well, he was old school and wouldn't listen to any ideas Bruce had.

1093
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,540
字幕
The bottom line is Bruce still didn't feel the freedom that he wanted.

1094
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,910
字幕
He said to Raymond Chow,

1095
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:56,270
字幕
"I want to make this film, The Way of the Dragon."

1096
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,400
字幕
I want to write it, I want to produce it, I want to direct it

1097
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,440
字幕
and I can do this and act in it.

1098
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,570
字幕
It's really a simple plot of a country boy

1099
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:06,720
字幕
going to a place where he cannot speak the language

1100
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,210
字幕
but somehow he came out on top.

1101
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:14,190
字幕
Because he, well, because he honestly and simply expressed himself. 

1102
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,670
字幕
He goes to Italy and the mafia can't beat him,

1103
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,970
字幕
so they call America and America sends over Colt.

1104
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:22,860
字幕
We must call America for Colt.

1105
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,800
字幕
- Is this Colt good? - Is Colt good?

1106
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,760
字幕
And Colt is Chuck Norris.

1107
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,300
字幕
Bruce Lee is fighting a real American, you know.

1108
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,670
字幕
He's strawberry blond. He's got hair all over his body.

1109
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:37,810
字幕
In fact, he uses that hair against him.

1110
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,180
字幕
So when he fought Chuck Norris...

1111
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,540
字幕
Bruce Lee represented the entire third world. 

1112
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:47,160
字幕
He represented all people of colour fighting the Western oppressor.

1113
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,200
字幕
the fight between bruce lee and chuck norris in the colosseum was a classic 

1114
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,740
字幕
fight to the death and bruce lee kicked his ass. 

1115
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,620
字幕
If you're a non-white viewer, this is a big deal.

1116
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:09,200
字幕
The little guy is beating the best that America can provide.

1117
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,400
字幕
I can tell you, at the Fox Theatre in St Louis,

1118
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,600
字幕
which was 100 percent all black, we cheered for him.

1119
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,330
字幕
Some of us were more politically aware than others,

1120
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,940
字幕
but everyone got the joke.

1121
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:27,790
字幕
He was very appealing to anybody who's ever been oppressed

1122
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,830
字幕
because of ethnic reasons or other reason.

1123
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:34,060
字幕
That time when Bruce was on the rise, we were looking for countercultural heroes

1124
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,060
字幕
to fight the establishment.

1125
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:38,480
字幕
It's 40 years. Wouldn't have people forgotten him by now?

1126
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,470
字幕
No, I think a lot of cultures have picked him up as sort of their hero.

1127
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:46,860
字幕
You had Muhammad Ali. You had Malcolm X. You had the Black Panthers.

1128
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,350
字幕
You had a lot of radicalism going on.

1129
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,940
字幕
Bruce Lee represented that same kind of radicalism.

1130
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:55,850
字幕
Bruce Lee emerges when America is having a very bad time in Vietnam

1131
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:58,600
字幕
and cannot beat the Viet Cong,

1132
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,580
字幕
these little yellow guys in pyjamas,

1133
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,440
字幕
so Bruce Lee speaks to that.

1134
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:07,940
字幕
Anywhere you go, everybody is about Bruce Lee and rallies behind him.

1135
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,030
字幕
He's the underdog.

1136
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,700
字幕
You don't have to start shouting political declarations

1137
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,990
字幕
to be culturally and politically significant.

1138
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,540
字幕
That Colosseum fight was very accurate. Taking nothing away from Chuck Norris,

1139
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,990
字幕
but I think Bruce Lee would be victorious.

1140
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:23,960
字幕
That fight scene gave Chuck Norris pretty much a career.

1141
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,860
字幕
If they said Bruce could have beat Chuck Norris,

1142
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,340
字幕
I'd say, "How much do you wanna bet?"

1143
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:32,130
字幕
I got a fistful of green backs in my pocket.

1144
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,320
字幕
Chuck got chucked out right there in that movie.

1145
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,660
字幕
That's one of my favourites. Boom. Guillotine choke in the '70s. Hello.

1146
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,730
字幕
That's being ahead of your time.

1147
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,180
字幕
When Bruce started doing the film Way of the Dragon

1148
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,460
字幕
and he was this huge star on the rise,

1149
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,860
字幕
things were changing.

1150
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,380
字幕
I think he started having a hard time trusting people around him.

1151
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,160
字幕
You bastard!

1152
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:02,880
字幕
Fame is a killer, literally.

1153
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,650
字幕
Put money on top of that.

1154
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:08,520
字幕
Suddenly you distrust people's motives, for very good reason.

1155
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,210
字幕
He had told me that he doesn't know who his friends were.

1156
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,070
字幕
He says he doesn't know who to trust.

1157
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:25,150
字幕
It was eye-opening to know what the price of fame was.

1158
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,040
字幕
well, let me put it this way, 

1159
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:30,590
字幕
to be honest and all that, I am not as bad as some of them

1160
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,860
字幕
 but I definitely am not saying that I am a saint.

1161
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,100
字幕
You can't go to school for it. You deal with it on a day-to-day basis.

1162
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,750
字幕
I cannot, you know, speak as freely as I,

1163
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,410
字幕
 you know, could before, because....

1164
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,170
字幕
misinterpretation comes in and, I mean, you know, all kinds of things.

1165
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,570
字幕
Fame took over my mind.

1166
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:53,320
字幕
It almost destroyed my career, my family.

1167
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,880
字幕
I was caught up in my own hype.

1168
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,160
字幕
I thought the only way to save myself from myself

1169
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,990
字幕
was to do something where I could get hit and hit back.

1170
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,680
字幕
And I thought I'd made a healthy choice

1171
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,820
字幕
because it was better than a whisky bottle or, you know, whatever the fuck.

1172
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:09,840
字幕
It got to the point

1173
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,930
字幕
where he could hardly go out of the house without people following him.

1174
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:17,220
字幕
He craved on sort of a soul level

1175
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,140
字幕
to be a little bit more peaceful.

1176
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,850
字幕
It’s strange in the sense that it’s like I’m in jail, 

1177
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,520
字幕
you know what I mean? I am like a monkey in the zoo,

1178
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,350
字幕
 you know? People looking at me and things like that.

1179
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,750
字幕
Well, you can't have a normal life

1180
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,570
字幕
or make normal mistakes

1181
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:36,840
字幕
because everybody's constantly, you know, looking in.

1182
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,290
字幕
And it was just like a smorgasbord.

1183
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:44,110
字幕
He could have had ten at a time if he even remotely wanted to.

1184
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:48,580
字幕
The word superstar really turned me off and I'll tell you why.

1185
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,360
字幕
Because the word star, man, it's an illusion.

1186
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,340
字幕
It's something what the public calls you.

1187
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,290
字幕
I really loved... I might get

1188
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:05,620
字幕
a lot of crap for this, but Game of Death,

1189
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,950
字幕
and to have like no way is the way.

1190
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:12,050
字幕
He's fighting each opponent that brings a different problem to the table

1191
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:13,090
字幕
and he's gotta adapt.

1192
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:18,390
字幕
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came to Hong Kong to visit and Bruce had this great idea.

1193
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:22,920
字幕
"Let's do a scene together. It'll be great, a great fighting sequence."

1194
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,910
字幕
I'd speak to Kareem about his sessions with Bruce and he said,

1195
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:29,040
字幕
"I sparred with him and like he was just so quick."

1196
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,440
字幕
"I'd turn this way and then he's not there."

1197
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,440
字幕
"He's kicking you in the back of the head."

1198
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,400
字幕
"Then I turn this way and he's over here."

1199
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:40,240
字幕
He said he couldn't catch him. There was just no way he could lock in on him.

1200
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,550
字幕
He was just like a rabbit.

1201
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:48,460
字幕
I really love the idea of the levels and getting to the next level,

1202
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,850
字幕
and fighting different styles.

1203
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:55,190
字幕
As a dancer who battled other dancers, that was like the whole mentality.

1204
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:59,150
字幕
And on the third level, it's supposed to be a person who is trained in weaponry,

1205
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,530
字幕
and so he chose me to do the part.

1206
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:05,260
字幕
Dan lnosanto, being one of the freshest Filipinos on the planet,

1207
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:07,990
字幕
was actually the person that brought the nunchucks to Bruce Lee.

1208
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,260
字幕
1964, I introduced the nunchucks to Bruce Lee.

1209
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,910
字幕
And at the time he thought this was a worthless piece of junk.

1210
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,130
字幕
When he moved into the LA area, I taught him how to use it.

1211
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,670
字幕
He said, "I'm gonna use this on The Green Hornet."

1212
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,330
字幕
Nunchucks was always some mother's broom getting sacrificed,

1213
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:43,740
字幕
which would then turn into someone's groin being sacrificed.

1214
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,140
字幕
In three months he was swinging it like he had been doing it for a lifetime.

1215
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,700
字幕
I was living in Miami when they came out.

1216
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:53,520
字幕
Every gangster in town had nunchucks, and couldn't use 'em worth a shit.

1217
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,880
字幕
I would spend hours whipping 'em around and trying to learn the moves,

1218
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,210
字幕
trying to copy how he'd have it under his shoulder right here

1219
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,890
字幕
and have the hand out.

1220
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,280
字幕
In a short time I think almost every child is using this.

1221
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,990
字幕
It became like a household product. It's outlawed now in California.

1222
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,730
字幕
After I watched this movie, I used to use that.

1223
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:18,050
字幕
But I always hit my elbow.

1224
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,410
字幕
Whaaa!

1225
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:24,160
字幕
Right out of the gate I swung real hard and I even made the Bruce Lee noise.

1226
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,130
字幕
I went, "Whoo!" and I hit my head

1227
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:30,320
字幕
and there was this big nut that came out maybe an inch.

1228
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,480
字幕
And after that I stopped making the noise

1229
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,080
字幕
and I stopped playing with the nunchucks.

1230
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,560
字幕
I tried to make my parents buy me some real ones. Thank God they didn't.

1231
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,400
字幕
I'm nunchucking, I'm busting myself all in the head.

1232
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,900
字幕
I had the rubber ones, so I'm good.

1233
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:49,170
字幕
I got into it because I stopped carrying a gun. I carried a gun for years.

1234
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,860
字幕
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1235
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,430
字幕
I think I went into therapy and I thought, "Let me carry something else."

1236
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,560
字幕
This one particularly is sentimental for me.

1237
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,920
字幕
These are the same nunchucks that we used in The Game of Death.

1238
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:04,600
字幕
He gave me these to keep in the house.

1239
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,300
字幕
It brings out really fond memories for me.

1240
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:18,220
字幕
Fred Weintraub, who was an executive at Warner Bros,

1241
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,680
字幕
comes to visit him in Hong Kong on the set of Game of Death,

1242
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,210
字幕
says, "Hey, man, we've seen what you can do."

1243
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,570
字幕
"We wanna do a film with you and we wanna do it with Warner Bros." Boom.

1244
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:32,260
字幕
It was a time when Bruce had so much opportunity

1245
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,110
字幕
and he was so thrilled to co-produce Enter the Dragon.

1246
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:40,610
字幕
He said, "This is my opening back into Hollywood."

1247
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,310
字幕
They were all there in Hong Kong,

1248
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,850
字幕
the producers, Fred Weintraub, Paul Heller.

1249
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:58,850
字幕
They're ready to film, have all this crew, Western crew, Chinese crew,

1250
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,290
字幕
which was a very difficult situation in itself,

1251
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:06,170
字幕
and sets are built, and Bruce won't come to work.

1252
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:13,030
字幕
He wants to put a little more Chinese philosophy that fits in with the story.

1253
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:15,200
字幕
Bruce knew what he wanted Dragon to be,

1254
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,790
字幕
but had problems with folks who didn't share his vision.

1255
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:20,400
字幕
And he was adamant he was not going to the set.

1256
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,530
字幕
It was kind of hard around our house because was Bruce was so frustrated.

1257
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:26,610
字幕
He could lose his temper.

1258
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,630
字幕
If he didn't like anything you did, he would tell you.

1259
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:31,090
字幕
Linda was that fabulous wife.

1260
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:34,520
字幕
She knew how to talk to him and counsel him.

1261
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:39,040
字幕
I was talking behind the scenes to Fred and Paul and the other people,

1262
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,640
字幕
saying, "You need to listen to what he has to say because he is right."

1263
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,530
字幕
He was fighting for his career.

1264
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,530
字幕
It was a coming together, and, yes, Bruce did get things in that film.

1265
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,120
字幕
Let me think.

1266
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:57,750
字幕
Don't think. Feel.

1267
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:01,100
字幕
And they're all better off, the world is better off,

1268
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,920
字幕
for the stand that he took that time.

1269
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:07,780
字幕
Action.

1270
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,140
字幕
Enter the Dragon was Hollywood's first dipping its toe

1271
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,550
字幕
into the water of the martial art genre.

1272
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:19,560
字幕
Bruce Lee is explosive in a way that no one had seen before.

1273
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:29,490
字幕
The opening scene, Bruce Lee basically put the mixed martial arts in his film.

1274
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,650
字幕
Fighting in the kenpo gloves.

1275
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:34,770
字幕
The mixed martial arts gloves with the open fingers.

1276
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,060
字幕
And he used arm bars.

1277
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,420
字幕
There's not a lot of charisma in a straight arm bar.

1278
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,060
字幕
He was the man.

1279
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:46,820
字幕
When he stomps out Bob Wall and kills him...

1280
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:52,160
字幕
you see a lot of complex emotions all going on at once.

1281
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,410
字幕
I haven't seen any actor in an action film

1282
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:59,870
字幕
match all those levels and nuances in the middle of a fight scene.

1283
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,490
字幕
The mirror scene was just, you know, when he's walking around

1284
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:09,830
字幕
and he's cut up and all of a sudden he hears his master in his head

1285
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:12,220
字幕
saying if you destroy the image...

1286
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:16,030
字幕
Destroy the image and you will break the enemy.

1287
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,050
字幕
You defeat the enemy,

1288
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,320
字幕
he was just... It had a tension

1289
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:23,930
字幕
that to me resonates because it's cutting through all illusions.

1290
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,750
字幕
This is the moment that he was waiting for.

1291
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:29,380
字幕
This was Bruce Lee's film in Hollywood.

1292
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,450
字幕
Bruce was in a studio doing dubbing for Enter the Dragon

1293
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:39,970
字幕
and he went to the restroom and he collapsed.

1294
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,400
字幕
I was called and came to the hospital.

1295
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,710
字幕
And he was unconscious and I was talking to him,

1296
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:52,380
字幕
and he told me later that he was like in the bottom of a well

1297
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:56,210
字幕
and he could hear me calling him, "Come back, come back."

1298
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,600
字幕
And he did recover from that.

1299
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,430
字幕
It was a cerebral oedema, a pressing of fluid on the brain,

1300
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,370
字幕
but they never found the cause of it.

1301
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:09,160
字幕
Ted Wong used to always tell me, "Bruce Lee was never afraid of anything,

1302
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:12,030
字幕
except one thing, and that's getting older."

1303
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,230
字幕
He came to the United States and had a complete physical

1304
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:17,370
字幕
and they pronounced him in perfect health

1305
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:19,360
字幕
with the body of an 18-year-old.

1306
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,660
字幕
The doctors were very reassuring.

1307
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:26,780
字幕
He had just had a collapse. He didn't have frequent headaches.

1308
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,610
字幕
Of course, they didn't have MRls then

1309
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:31,210
字幕
to see what his brain tissue was looking like.

1310
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:32,970
字幕
I had seen him in June.

1311
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:36,740
字幕
He told me that he'd had an OK from UCLA that his body was fit.

1312
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,500
字幕
He was not worried about himself and he was taking good care of himself.

1313
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,730
字幕
Bruce Lee faces a real dilemma.

1314
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,660
字幕
He's on the verge of stardom in the United States,

1315
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,820
字幕
but he's just achieved superstardom as a film actor here in Hong Kong.

1316
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,280
字幕
So what does he chose, the East or the West?

1317
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,570
字幕
It's the kind of problem most budding movie actors would welcome.

1318
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,620
字幕
I was called and told by Raymond Chow, "You should get to the hospital."

1319
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,750
字幕
"They're taking Bruce to the hospital."

1320
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:12,020
字幕
And I was there way before Bruce got there.

1321
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:16,780
字幕
So eventually the ambulance arrived. It took a long time.

1322
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:19,020
字幕
Everything took too long a time.

1323
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,550
字幕
He got to the hospital and I saw him laying there

1324
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:28,300
字幕
and I saw them do a big injection of something right into his heart.

1325
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:37,450
字幕
And I remember turning to a medical person standing there and saying...

1326
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:39,530
字幕
I couldn't say, "Is he dead?"

1327
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,170
字幕
I said, "Is he alive?

1328
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,870
字幕
And they shook their heads and said, "No."

1329
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:51,120
字幕
And that was just unbelievable.

1330
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:55,440
字幕
It must be a mistake, you know, it's not real.

1331
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:59,240
字幕
What can I say? It was.

1332
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:44,600
字幕
You can see how when he passed away, you know, how...

1333
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:50,830
字幕
how difficult that was and, you know, how difficult that was for my dad.

1334
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,310
字幕
It's the first time I saw my dad ever cry.

1335
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,320
字幕
Yeah, that's true.

1336
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,860
字幕
It was really rough.

1337
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,410
字幕
Well, yeah.

1338
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:12,040
字幕
I said, "Dan, is it true? Ls Bruce Lee dead?"

1339
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,070
字幕
"I got a lot of calls." And he says, "Yeah, Rich."

1340
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,330
字幕
Linda called him from Hong Kong,

1341
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:21,320
字幕
and he was in a trance on his own and talking about Bruce Lee.

1342
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,820
字幕
He was so in grief, so in mourning about Bruce's death.

1343
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:28,840
字幕
He was just really uniquely different from everybody else.

1344
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:33,000
字幕
My memories, they're more like glimpses.

1345
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:37,510
字幕
But I remember primarily the funeral in Hong Kong,

1346
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:41,220
字幕
because it was so massive, and sort of being dragged through that,

1347
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,670
字幕
because it was chaotic.

1348
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:49,090
字幕
And I remember my dad's mom taking us to get candy

1349
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:53,190
字幕
and feeling really happy about that.

1350
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,000
字幕
I was in class, actually, when Bruce Lee died.

1351
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,750
字幕
There were guys in there crying, sobbing, just...

1352
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,010
字幕
I mean, Bruce Lee, you know...

1353
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,950
字幕
He was just... he was it.

1354
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:14,330
字幕
Will you tell me what Teacher died of?

1355
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,150
字幕
Forensic scientists from around the world came up with the conclusion

1356
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,720
字幕
that he had had a hypersensitive reaction

1357
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,060
字幕
to this medication that he had been given for a headache

1358
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:28,140
字幕
and that that had caused the fluid on his brain

1359
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:32,760
字幕
and that he had succumbed to that.

1360
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:38,130
字幕
It's still something that people cannot believe.

1361
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,830
字幕
He was well. There was nothing wrong. How could a healthy man die?

1362
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:46,360
字幕
And then there's all this stuff about, you know, how he died,

1363
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,220
字幕
the sinister way in which he died.

1364
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:51,820
字幕
He had an aneurysm

1365
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,170
字幕
or the death hands got him or, you know...

1366
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,120
字幕
He was murdered.

1367
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,920
字幕
They gave him the dim mak, they gave him a death touch.

1368
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,100
字幕
There's absolutely positively something a little shady

1369
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,560
字幕
about the way that it all went down.

1370
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,460
字幕
How he could pass away at that age, you know, but it does happen,

1371
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,860
字幕
so I've learned to cope with it and deal with it.

1372
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:15,130
字幕
But it always puzzled me.

1373
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:17,150
字幕
The fact that my family is cursed

1374
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:21,960
字幕
and the very sad and tragic circumstance that my brother died,

1375
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,440
字幕
those are sort of the themes that pop up.

1376
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,670
字幕
They wrote so many stupid stories, the tong killing him and all that bullshit,

1377
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:31,560
字幕
and he died of drugs, that sold magazines.

1378
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:35,690
字幕
He died in Betty Ting Pei's apartment, so there's no denying that.

1379
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:40,290
字幕
The decision was made by the producers to say that he had died at home.

1380
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:44,110
字幕
When that news got out that he had not died at home,

1381
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,360
字幕
the tabloid press went crazy.

1382
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,470
字幕
But my mom knew he had been at a meeting and doing his films.

1383
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,530
字幕
She was dealing with his death and taking care of her kids,

1384
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:56,810
字幕
and all of that gossip was just the tabloid press

1385
01:21:56,810 --> 01:22:01,910
字幕
trying to make it bigger and crazier than it needed to be.

1386
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,490
字幕
It is my wish that the newspapers and the people of Hong Kong

1387
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,100
字幕
will stop speculating on the circumstances

1388
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,090
字幕
surrounding my husband's death.

1389
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:15,980
字幕
Please remember him for his genius, his art

1390
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,920
字幕
and the magic he brought to every one of us.

1391
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:32,680
字幕
Of course I was going to go and see his film and applaud him

1392
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,100
字幕
and be with people who admired him.

1393
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:41,120
字幕
That was always my thought in my head, is, "I need to do this for Bruce."

1394
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,770
字幕
She really is this incredible woman

1395
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:47,840
字幕
with just great dignity and grace under fire.

1396
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,560
字幕
It was great to see Bruce again,

1397
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,150
字幕
but only a month later my memories were very fresh anyway, you know.

1398
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,780
字幕
It was more pain than joy at the time.

1399
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:11,800
字幕
Everybody said all these years, you know,

1400
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,170
字幕
he had an allergic reaction to marijuana, he had a brain aneurysm.

1401
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:19,340
字幕
The most important thing is how he lived.

1402
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:24,220
字幕
Every time you see him, it's still emotional.

1403
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,170
字幕
We miss the friend.

1404
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:30,650
字幕
I'm now 74, but there really has not ever been a day

1405
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:34,700
字幕
that I haven't thought about him at least once, maybe twice

1406
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,740
字幕
or three times or four times or five times through the day.

1407
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:41,600
字幕
There's nobody who's gonna replace Bruce Lee, not while you or I are alive.

1408
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,790
字幕
It just ain't gonna happen.

1409
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,990
字幕
This genius passes away way before his time.

1410
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:48,490
字幕
We have to be thankful we had him for 32 years.

1411
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,500
字幕
Bruce Lee was just a symbol

1412
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,520
字幕
of everything that every little boy wanted to be.

1413
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,940
字幕
You have offended my family and you have...

1414
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:00,000
字幕
Disgraced the Shaolin temple.

1415
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,370
字幕
Whoo!

1416
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,450
字幕
The most important thing he's ever done and accomplished

1417
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,110
字幕
is bringing people together.

1418
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,240
字幕
Bruce brought... he brought cultures together.

1419
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:14,600
字幕
People remember him for being powerful beyond measure,

1420
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,520
字幕
you know, for being limitless,

1421
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,950
字幕
for standing for things when people crucified him.

1422
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:22,950
字幕
It didn't matter what colour you are, what country you came from,

1423
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:24,480
字幕
you were a Bruce Lee fan.

1424
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,140
字幕
He's the man. He's the truth.

1425
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:30,300
字幕
And it was amazing how he connected so many people.

1426
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,420
字幕
Not just martial arts, but people from all walks of life.

1427
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,000
字幕
If Bruce was here today, he'd be on Dancing with the Stars

1428
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,570
字幕
and he'd win it, hands down.

1429
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:41,450
字幕
Doggone it, such is the basic need of a human being,

1430
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:44,700
字幕
I might as well enjoy it before I kick the bucket,

1431
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,570
字幕
like that type of an attitude.

1432
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:50,800
字幕
We remember Bruce Lee today because he was so much fun to watch.

1433
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,600
字幕
He was like a mythological hero.

1434
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:58,410
字幕
My strength flowed through Bruce to me, so...

1435
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:00,290
字幕
He left me with that gift.

1436
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:03,490
字幕
The idea is running water never grows stale,

1437
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,980
字幕
so you gotta just keep on flowing.

1438
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,180
字幕
He didn't compromise.

1439
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:12,120
字幕
People really felt that presence about him and felt that influence from him

1440
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,610
字幕
and they just wanna somehow connect with him.

1441
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,900
字幕
When people try to relate to him, they do say,

1442
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,020
字幕
"That's my Bruce Lee. That's what I connect with."

1443
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:25,340
字幕
When I watch Bruce Lee, I am Bruce Lee.

1444
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:31,940
字幕
- Dragon whips his tail. - Dragon whips his tail.

1445
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,340
字幕
I watch Bruce Lee, you watch Bruce Lee and we're both being Bruce Lee.

1446
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,590
字幕
Bruce would want us to recognise

1447
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,460
字幕
that he honestly expressed himself,

1448
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:46,960
字幕
that he did not bow down to any sacred cows.

1449
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,970
字幕
To express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself,

1450
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,620
字幕
and to express myself honestly,

1451
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,180
字幕
that, my friend, is very hard to do.

1452
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:01,260
字幕
He would urge others to examine your life, you know,

1453
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,640
字幕
see how things fit you personally,

1454
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,750
字幕
find your strength, take a stab at life,

1455
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:10,750
字幕
don't just sit back and take it easy, you know?

1456
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,420
字幕
That's not what life is about.

1457
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:22,840
字幕
It's even more fun to see him now when I look back, you know.

1458
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,890
字幕
Oh! What an amazing young man he was.

1459
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,820
字幕
Do you think of yourself as Chinese or North American?

1460
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:43,710
字幕
You know what I want to think of myself?

1461
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,570
字幕
As a human being.

1462
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:51,010
字幕
Because, I mean, I don't wanna sound like "as Confucius say",

1463
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:54,750
字幕
but under the sky, under the heaven, man, there is but one family.

1464
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:58,740
字幕
It just so happened, man, that people are different.

1465
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:36,890
字幕
Empty your mind. 

1466
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,840
字幕
Be formless
