1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
1549航班，清除起飛。

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
1549次航班，準備起飛

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
五月天，五月天，船長1549，它被打開

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
開業

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
沒有依靠電機2

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
船長1549，我們可以得到在跑道13期

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,100
我們不能做到，我們義無反顧地拉瓜迪亞

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
拉瓜迪亞大廈，1549航班我們將盡量使13

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
蘇利，我們是太低

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
蘇利，我們是太低了！

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
來吧！

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
它的設置著火了！

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
來吧！

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
玷污

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
鸚鵡，我愛你！

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
到底是你怎麼了？

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
每個人，每個人都活了下來飛行1549！

18
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,000
你以為你會死，那是你的想法

19
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,800
然後，奇跡般地你不知道！

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
謝謝隊長，謝謝！

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
謝謝！

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
感謝您Sullbenger船長今天在這裡。

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
我也歡迎副駕駛斯基爾斯

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
很高興你在這一點上做到了。

25
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
藏漢不是像我們。

26
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
為了記錄在案，我們有一個飛機的系統調查，

27
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
而且飛機結構，MRT

28
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,100
飛機性能比較，ATCS，壽命的因素，生存因素

29
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
ND還應急今天我們開始

30
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,100
我們的運營，人力性能和調查。

31
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
美國1549航班墜毀

32
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
水降落。

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,700
隊長？

34
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
這不是崩潰，這是一個水上降落。

35
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
我們知道我們在試圖執行

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,500
這不是崩潰，這是一個被迫水上降落。

37
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,200
你為什麼不試圖返回拉瓜迪亞？

38
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,300
有根本沒有足夠的高度

39
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,900
哈德森是唯一的地方足夠的長度和光滑，足夠寬，能夠嘗試登陸。

40
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,400
空中交通作證說，你正在返回拉瓜迪亞，但你沒有。

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
當我開始左轉，

42
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,800
我意識到我不能讓它回來，我就已經消除了其他選項

43
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,200
返回拉瓜迪亞將是一個錯誤。

44
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,700
讓我們來看看你如何計算所有這些參數。

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,700
沒有時間來計算。

46
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,200
我一直依賴於我的過去四十年管理的航班千元的高度和速度體驗。

47
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,300
你說你沒有計算...

48
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
我嘗試。

49
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
- 您嘗試。

50
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
是。

51
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
最好的機會了乘客是這一點。

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,400
我敢打賭它我的生活。事實上，我做了！

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
而且我會再次這樣做。

54
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
航空工程師推論你有足夠的能量來回到跑道上。

55
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,400
工程師並沒有飛行員。他們錯了。

56
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,600
而且他們不存在。

57
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
無論如何，我們必須遵守所有影響作為調查的一部分。

58
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
我們的電腦analized方案

59
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,100
運行算法，具有精確的參數寫入模擬。

60
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
發動機損失，高度，一切你面對

61
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
當你做出你的決定。

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
我想監督這些計算機模擬

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
在調查過程中不可能的。

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
你這兒待它是一個雙引擎故障

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
由於鳥多次打擊？

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
這將是前所未有的！

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,600
一切都是前所未有的，直到它發生的第一次。

68
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
你是怎樣的睡眠是前一天晚上？

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
八個小時，就夠了。

70
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,400
這是可能的，血糖低？

71
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,900
我休息了，驚動了，完全知道我的周圍。

72
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,800
當你最後DRING，Sullenbenger船長？

73
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
九天前。

74
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
Droghe？

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
不，麥。

76
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,200
副駕駛斯凱爾斯？

77
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
我不喝酒，我從來沒有。

78
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
隊長，

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,500
你有過在家裡任何麻煩了嗎？

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
哦，不是比誰。

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
並沒有什麼，影響我的工作。

82
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
廢話。

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,300
但是，他們為什麼要找的東西，我們做錯了什麼？

84
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,700
這橫空出世的權利。

85
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,700
它沒有為航空公司和他們的保險公司橫空出世的權利。

86
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
我們應該期待一些反吹。

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
哦，像他們能說什麼？

88
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
我們不應該救的人呢？

89
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,300
這不是個人的。

90
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
The're只是在做自己的工作。

91
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,400
放鬆，平靜下來。

92
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
蘇利，他們應該給你一個金牌

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
送你回去工作。

94
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
對不起，此郵箱已滿。

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,400
我沒有叫洛瑞今天早上，我猜別人沒

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
沒有意思打擾，但我不得不說：

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,100
這是一種榮譽駕駛今天你。

98
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
謝謝。

99
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,700
到目前為止，有什麼新的說法嗎？二樓去了，

100
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,700
數百萬沒有工作，這是一月的第一個星期。

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
不過，今天的頭條新聞：

102
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
這很漂亮！

103
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,300
嘿邁克，我們為什麼不獲取驅動程序作為一個字符的見證？

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
最後。

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
哦，終於。

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
該航空公司已經給了我們被困一整天。

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,500
只是......我需要聽到你的聲音。

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
我heared其他人的。

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
你會驚奇地發現你有多少堂兄弟都有。

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,100
它沒有太多的感覺像家人一樣。

111
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
這是不是在這裡太安靜了。

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,100
有記者問的更新。

113
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
蘇利內部的頭腦。

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
洛瑞，告訴他們你不能談論。

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
我不能聽你的，只是叫我以後。

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
你不必與他們交談。

117
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
給我回電話。

118
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
你已經得到的消息？

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
你achiedeved不可能的事？

120
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
我覺得有一個汽車記者的。

121
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,400
自衛隊，認為陪審員將convinct？

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
你必須做的事情。

123
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
不，我所要求的權限。

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
警察會追你了。

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
蘇利你在做什麼？

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
薩利，你在聽我說話嗎？

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
我們應該再聊。

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
我一直在閱讀了一整天。

129
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
你還好嗎？

130
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
是啊，我只是累了，僅此而已。

131
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
怎麼樣的女生？

132
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
哦，好。

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
不堪重負了一下，聽起來好像你也有同感。

134
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
是啊，我會沒事的。

135
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
整個世界都在談論你。

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
蘇利，我不能相信這一點。

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
洛瑞，我得留在這裡，

138
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,900
待調查結束後，我告訴已經？

139
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
和我道歉，如果我沒告訴過你了。

140
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,100
你不需要道歉，你說的沒錯，你需要的人。

141
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
你知道，我沒有盡我所能。

142
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
當然，你做到了。

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
你救了大家。

144
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
也許我們應該講是在早晨。

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
我累了。

146
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,400
我對所有這些關注不堪重負。

147
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,900
我會在電視上第二天早上，他們會怎麼問我？

148
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,100
蘇利你要我來和你在一起？

149
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
沒有洛瑞

150
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
女孩子們需要你。

151
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
告訴他們我愛他們。

152
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
我愛你。

153
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
去睡一會。

154
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,500
是啊，也許我會醒來這將是1月14日。

155
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
那不是很好？

156
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
我愛你。

157
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,900
為什麼機長薩倫伯格所做的忠實決定將哈德森進入跑道？

158
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
好了，只有他能回答。

159
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
但是，我們現在知道，這是一個錯誤的選擇。

160
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,700
危及所有那些在船上的生活選擇。

161
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,000
因此，儘管該國大部分地區的稱讚他是英雄

162
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,000
這一新的信息肯定會改變對哈德森所謂奇跡的大家的理解

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,800
蘇利Sullenberger，你是英雄，還是一個騙局？

164
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,500
你好？

165
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
傑夫？對不起，給你打電話這麼晚。

166
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
這沒關係，有沒有在這個房間裡沒有睡覺無論是。

167
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
你能相信他們收取5元錢買了士力架？

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,600
我可以乘坐航空公司破產四個叮咬。

169
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
我想你可能想說話！ -絕對

170
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
讓我們得到一些空氣。

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
大

172
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
我將在那裡在5分鐘內。

173
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
享受震動？

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
惡夢？微弱的心跳？

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
一點點。該聯盟為我們提供咨詢。

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,400
是啊，你會說什麼？你是在一次飛機失事和生活。

177
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
它可能在你的日常產生影響。

178
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
我不喜歡在這個過程中的控制不是。

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
我贏了自己，

180
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,300
6個月內，我們會笑，因為我們知道大衛·萊特曼

181
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
我們正在做的大衛·萊特曼？

182
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
是啊，下周的面試後。

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
我猜大衛會激發你。

184
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
這是超現實如此。

185
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,400
我想我有在無論從任何地獄，這是現實分離的一些問題。

186
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
是啊，這是兩種人凍結他們的驢關閉

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
蘇利，別擔心，你做一個偉大的日子。

188
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
它會記住很長一段時間。

189
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
這裡有一個有趣的事：

190
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,900
我已經完成了超過一百萬人次超過40年在空氣中

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,800
但最終I'lm會被評為208秒

192
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
來吧，明天會是個好日子。

193
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,200
計算機將證明你是對的，你就會把你的翅膀回

194
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
你想運行？

195
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
是的，讓我們來運行。

196
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
冷他媽的在這裡。

197
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,600
這是顯而易見的，這是一個嚴峻的形勢

198
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
在低空失去兩個引擎

199
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
在地球上人口最多的地區之一

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,000
但是你選擇了降落在哈得遜，那仍然是一個大IF

201
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,700
我相信我能做到這一點

202
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,500
你之前是？

203
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
是。

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
你感覺如何時，人家罵你是英雄？

205
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,800
我不覺得自己是個英雄。我只是一個人誰在做他的工作。

206
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,700
正確的人選在合適的時間

207
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
你已經飛行了什麼呢？近40年？

208
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,400
42，那是我的生命

209
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,600
我的一生

210
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
飛機

211
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,800
炸彈工藝

212
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,800
我會很忙的兒子，讓你保持飛機乾淨吧。

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,000
他們是$每小時6認為這是一個課時

214
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,200
飛行員從來沒有停止收購knwledge。你會犯錯誤，大家都一樣。

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,100
不要忘了，不管發生了什麼，飛飛機。

216
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
當然，先生！

217
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
另外一個東西，這是很重要的！先生？

218
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
你可以微笑！

219
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
好的！

220
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,400
我為我出汗道歉。

221
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
哦，不，畢竟你沒有，我不認為凱蒂可能更嚇人

222
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,000
哦，那不是凱蒂，這是光，你把相機。

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
好吧，我們就大功告成了。

224
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,600
這是從我的媽媽。

225
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,600
她叫布倫達，她告訴我說謝謝，她是單身！

226
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,800
好吧，告訴布倫達謝謝你，但我在家裡有一個女孩。

227
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
幸運的女人

228
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
蘇利，SULLY！

229
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,400
薩利，你在哪裡？

230
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
我站在這裡呼喚你的名字。

231
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
你怎麼了？

232
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,600
你需要得到關注，因為媒體請求雪崩繼續。

233
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,400
是啊。

234
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,600
拉裡·魯尼主動請纓跳和運行獵槍的方式休息

235
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
想你可能需要一個朋友。

236
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
他會帶你到現在NTSB。

237
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,700
空中客車完成計算機模擬藏漢

238
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
好，好，這將幫助！

239
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
還有別的東西

240
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,600
所謂辦事處，左發動機仍在運行

241
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,100
不可能的，我覺得它走了。這就像它在半空中停止。

242
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
他們說，有一個機會，這是亞空轉。

243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,100
我只是讓你知道，因為NTSB已經這樣做。

244
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
你一定是在開玩笑吧。

245
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,000
我們的工作是調查。我們的飛機在哈得遜河結束了。

246
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
是不是有點早了，你去釣魚？

247
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,700
搜索事實是不完全去釣魚，老八先生，

248
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,300
讓我們來看看最重要的事實：當時只有兩個人誰知道發生了什麼

249
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
在這一天的駕駛艙，我就是其中之一。

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
非常感謝您的觀點。

251
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
今天我們為什麼在這裡？

252
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,500
是不是因為Sullenberger機長沒有返回拉瓜迪亞？

253
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,200
看在AR320，我剛剛完成訓練，我可以告訴你飛機操作如此出色的唯一理由

254
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,000
是因為船長的輔助動力裝置開啟

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
他只是跟著QRH

256
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,400
不，不，他不是。他沒有按照正確的步驟都沒有。

257
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
我知道，因為我已經在我手中QRH。

258
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,300
他反吹發動機後，立即切換到APU。據空客這是做第15件事。

259
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,900
如果他跟著該死的規則，我們就死定了。

260
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,700
也許這就是你不喜歡的部分。你必須回答您的猜測

261
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,800
你看，他只是說，我拿著它做什麼和它做什麼做AR320

262
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,600
我拿著死者的飛行員recountless CVR成績單和我有顯著事故調查的經驗。

263
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,100
毫無疑問，你是一個有才華的，敬業，經驗豐富的專業。

264
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,100
調查之前每次崩潰不是本次調查的對象。只有今天美國航空公司1549事宜。

265
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:12,500
你的工會已被告知，該數據涉及了左發動機繼續飛行過程中設置自己。

266
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
那麼數據是錯誤的

267
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,900
有證據表明，該引擎是空閒或子空閒立即鳥擊以下。

268
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,500
你給我看左邊的發動機，我告訴你死禽和無動力

269
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,800
左發動機失去了在事故中，由於對著陸過多的損害。

270
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
稍後我們會繞回了，

271
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,300
我們只是假設，就像你說的，雙引擎的損失。

272
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:46,700
你的體重是151.510磅，風力和溫度，秦皇島港，西北方，21度，速度和高度200點頭2818英尺。

273
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
正確。

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:57,300
美國航空公司1549航班的計算機模擬表明，航空工程師是正確的。

275
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,000
有足夠的速度和高度的鳥擊的成功的返回拉瓜迪亞後

276
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
成功的？

277
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,500
飛機降落在拉瓜迪亞機場完好，無損壞。

278
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
你說從一台計算機模擬？

279
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
不，20。

280
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:27,500
包括從拉瓜迪亞機場跑道上作出努力。每台計算機模擬與精確飛行參數

281
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,200
表明返回拉瓜迪亞機場是可能的。而且不只是可能，很可能。

282
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
是否有人在這裡需要進一步的計算機證據？

283
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Sullenberger隊長？

284
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
副駕駛斯凱爾斯？

285
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,700
這次不行。我想去過來的參數。

286
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,900
我們將使其可用於聯盟。

287
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,800
而一旦調查完成後，我們將能夠分享實際的計算機模擬

288
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,000
現在，他們仍然是保密的。我們不能洩露給新聞界。

289
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
已經有對新聞界已經太多交談。

290
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:22,100
當完整的駕駛艙語音編譯，旁邊帶有板載成績單，我們會打電話給你。

291
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,200
謝謝您們。美好的一天。

292
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
謝謝。

293
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
我們不是在玩吃豆人，我們開飛機的人。

294
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,800
其他的一些，則要記住它。這只是看起來不正確

295
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,700
這是因為這是不對的你所做的一切你可以，那是綽綽有餘。

296
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,700
問問你的乘客，問問你的妻子和孩子。問洛瑞

297
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
那麼，什麼是你從駕駛艙聽到的第一件事？

298
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
佈雷斯衝擊

299
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,400
現在，聽說過，以前？

300
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
不，其實也沒什麼

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
聽說過，在你生活的任何方面？

302
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
就拿本次車展離我而去。

303
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,400
傑夫是輕鬆和精緻。他應該得到比其他請求。

304
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,500
難道他們付你？對於所有這些媒體的東西，至少？

305
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
沒有付款是必要的。

306
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
哦，我希望銀行有同樣的感覺

307
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
為什麼？你什麼意思？

308
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,100
這只是....我們有另外一個通知。

309
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
關於查看縣的空間。

310
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,900
好了，我們會找到一個租戶。它只是需要時間。

311
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,300
你已經說了9個月，蘇利它仍然空缺

312
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
經濟已經轉一轉。

313
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,600
這感覺就像，如果我們失去了空間，接下來的事情將是房子。

314
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
洛瑞，我們不會失去房子。

315
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
對不起。

316
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,800
我很抱歉，我只是著急，獨自睡不夠。

317
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,300
是啊，我沒有得到足夠的睡眠無論是。

318
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
對不起增加你的壓力，但是，只要告訴我，你很快就會回來。

319
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,000
那麼直到NTSB已完成調查。

320
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
我們需要你飛行。

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,900
洛瑞，如果出了問題，我的職業生涯，作為安全專家，將結束，為網站和名片。

322
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,500
我更擔心你的職業生涯作為試點。

323
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
如果我做這個打擊？

324
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
你在說什麼？

325
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
如果我做的事情錯了，結束我的職業生涯？

326
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,900
如果我所危及的那些乘客的生命。

327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,600
蘇利，看新聞！

328
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
你是英雄！

329
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,400
而且每個人都會習慣它，包括國家運輸安全委員會。

330
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,000
第一種情況情景：NTSB列出我的可能原因。

331
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,900
這是直接退休，沒有退休金。

332
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
我的生命也就結束了。

333
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,500
好吧你現在嚇到我，薩利。這是怎麼回事？

334
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,800
左發動機可能仍然被閒置-ING。

335
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,600
而空客模擬說我仍然可以使人們回拉瓜安全。

336
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,100
但它沒有意義。

337
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,000
這是與一切討論中，我在駕駛艙的感覺。

338
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,600
那你為什麼這麼做玷污？

339
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,400
在水之地呢？這不是你可以做很多的危險的事情！

340
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
下午好。

341
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,100
金槍魚Vasel或天堂破碎。

342
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
金槍魚Vasel，很新鮮！

343
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
謝謝

344
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,200
今天太冷，太寒冷！

345
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,900
當你要和我一起去飛？

346
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
當美國航空公司開始飛往HIDRO酒吧。

347
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,900
我會談談，看是否能正常工作。

348
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,500
這是星期四！

349
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,000
皮箱已經塞滿禮物的意志。

350
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,800
總是有趣的獲得在機場的事。看來你旅行。

351
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,200
媽媽，他的轉向1.不要認為他能知道從哪裡傳來什麼禮物。

352
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
但我會。

353
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
也許一個雪球。

354
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,500
這是他會記得。一些來自紐約。

355
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
你忘了，當我們還是孩子？

356
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,600
好吧親愛的，我給你拿一個雪球了。

357
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
精細。來吧。

358
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
下午好。

359
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
隊長。

360
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
嗨，傑夫！我們不會做了！

361
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,800
我相信你此行，正好符合我們在門口好嗎？

362
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
高度表核實，3023。

363
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
3023。

364
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,100
清單完成。

365
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,200
你真的認為有凹陷？

366
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,400
檢查latests報告，我們可以把它一路夏洛特。

367
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,100
從牛排到弗裡斯科，在我身上。

368
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,300
我從來沒有been.And我聽到好東西

369
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,700
哦，大黃會打破你的心臟。

370
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,000
是的，我更喜歡小豬家的人。

371
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
小豬家就會停止你的心臟。

372
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,800
慢著，慢著慢著！

373
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,000
嗨，我很抱歉，精神給我們送來。我們註銷，你說你有個座位。

374
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
飛行是封閉的。

375
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
等待，看到那傢伙，看著那裡？

376
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,600
這是我的爸爸，這是一個緊急情況。他一定是在這次飛行。

377
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
好了，大家說的一樣。

378
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
高爾夫緊急情況。它是否去取消？

379
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,600
標識討好。

380
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
有多少行？ 3。

381
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,900
沒有在一起。我們會找到辦法的。

382
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,300
在這裡，我們去：22A，6A和6C

383
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
非常感謝！

384
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
很高興你來了！

385
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,500
你在6傑夫。哦，不，那是吉米，我會得到一些睡眠。

386
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,900
你要在這裡睡覺嗎？不敢靠近你。

387
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
喲，喲，晚安！

388
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
對不起，原諒我。

389
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
嗯，當然咯。

390
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,100
對不起，他喜歡拋開一切。這是完美的，我想趕一切。

391
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,900
昨晚我用Google搜索你。找到你的公司的網站。

392
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,400
這是令人印象深刻。謝謝。

393
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,500
我想我是一個很好的bullshitter，但你！你可以去臨！

394
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:20,300
只是在開玩笑，但你的網站沒有在3個國家擔心100名員工和總部

395
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,200
當更多的搜索，我意識到，這只是你。

396
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,500
現在，去方便。我剛剛完成它。

397
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,100
我從來沒有acused是一個bullshitter。

398
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,600
別誤會！這是一種恭維。

399
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,900
現在，該網站，我認識你！

400
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,700
下午好女士們，先生們，歡迎乘坐美國航空公司1549航班。

401
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:53,100
獲取一定要按照安全說明卡在你面前椅背，解釋THI飛機上的安全功能，為藏漢緊急出口的位置。

402
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,500
拉瓜迪亞，這是1549，準備過關

403
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,200
好了1549，128準備和保護。

404
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
獲得肯定把它們關掉。

405
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
只有一次我希望去拉瓜迪亞時間。

406
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,700
那麼你知道燙去拉瓜迪亞。

407
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
不，那是什麼？

408
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
飛在肯尼迪機場。

409
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
取出燃油品質驗證。

410
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,100
19000船上貨物。

411
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
船長的1549，跑道4，清除起飛。

412
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,800
船長的1549，清除起飛。

413
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
正鑽機

414
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
哈德遜河上的尼斯認為

415
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
我不能克服的是多麼的美麗在這裡了。

416
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
生活在空氣中更容易。

417
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
我想，這是。

418
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,300
鳥類！

419
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
媽的！

420
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
我很擔心，這是怎麼回事？

421
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
沒關係。

422
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
這可能是一個好主意，讓你的安全帶上。

423
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
我們有一個滾動回來。

424
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,600
我們有回滾。

425
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
點火啟動。

426
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
重新啟動APU。

427
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
只需仔細檢查你的安全帶吧。

428
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
安全帶。

429
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,200
你覺得它是什麼？我認為這是一個鳥擊。

430
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
我們不得不回頭來拉瓜迪亞。是啊。

431
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
走出QRH

432
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
我們失去了兩個引擎。

433
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
五月天，五月天這是船長1549，我們撞鳥了。

434
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,500
我們已經失去了兩個引擎，我們回頭來拉瓜迪亞。

435
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
好吧，你需要返回拉瓜迪亞？

436
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
左轉220。

437
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
你失去了哪個引擎？

438
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
在這兩方面，這兩款發動機。

439
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
湯，我有一個緊急情況。

440
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
什麼是報告？

441
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
這兩款發動機，這兩款發動機不見了。

442
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,700
拉瓜迪亞說去跑道13

443
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,200
塔，停止起飛，我們有一個緊急返回。 1549航班，鳥擊。

444
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
我們已經失去了兩個引擎，立即返回。

445
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
他失去了兩個引擎。

446
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,000
船長1549，如果你能得到一個觀點，你想嘗試跑道13的土地？

447
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
我們無法。我們將在哈德遜結束。

448
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,800
我有在河邊的A320潛水。鋁，棧拉瓜迪亞界外球。

449
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
讓我們把負載在塔吧。

450
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,000
我需要一個跑道，機長1549需要在機場拿到現在。

451
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
較新的塔，你是怎麼了？ 29號跑道準備。需要緊急降落？

452
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
是的，我會右側為Ftaburogh

453
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
拉屎。

454
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
這是隊長的支撐影響。

455
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,700
什麼？撐，撐，撐

456
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
低著頭，停留下來！

457
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,300
撐，撐，撐

458
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,900
低著頭，停留下來！

459
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,800
船長1549，右轉至3-0。您可以在運行方式1 0降落了。

460
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
這是消極的，我們降落在哈得孫河。

461
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
對不起，再說一遍？

462
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,100
船長1549雷達失去聯繫。

463
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
IC，到這兒來。

464
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,000
我也得到了一個較新的副本凌晨2點左右，大約7英里。

465
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,900
船長1549，如果可以的話，你得到了跑道29可在??2點左右，7英里。

466
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
對不起帕特裡克。

467
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
不，他即將紐瓦克，他只是開箱。

468
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Hook'em備份。

469
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
我們需要授權的消息。

470
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,600
注意所有飛機在JW附近，

471
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,100
我們看到，船號1549 ...低了哈德遜

472
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
我的目光在他身上

473
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,700
好了掛在直升機的視覺效果。

474
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
他在那裡。

475
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,800
他前往紐瓦克，7英里。只有7英里。

476
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,300
船長的1549，這是離港控制，防範，你看？

477
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
這是怎麼回事了

478
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
船長的1549，你看我嗎？

479
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,300
媽的，這是怎麼回事了！這會碰到水！

480
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
測試人員會降下來。

481
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
符合伊麗莎，它的標準。

482
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
他的聲音是那麼的平靜！

483
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,300
當他說，哈得遜，我也不會相信！

484
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,900
這沒有發生。

485
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,700
我們已經拿出了水上岸的倖存者，不是嗎？

486
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
擁抱

487
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
我還是走吧。

488
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,000
我很抱歉。我愛你。

489
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
是啊，我得走了。

490
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,300
選擇在哈德遜降落是一個巨大的IF！

491
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:39,000
有證據表明，回拉瓜迪亞機場是可能的。左發動機是亞空轉

492
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,600
這是美味11我有故障緊急迫降

493
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
收到。

494
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
看起來像水力學。

495
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
主席先生，我們需要迎頭趕上。

496
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
運行控制試驗。

497
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
我們需要更多的高度。

498
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
塔，這是微動11飛行控制

499
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,100
收到，左轉為2-2-0

500
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
無法

501
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,000
好了，繼續直行約2 1

502
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
2 1，非常感謝

503
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
2 1，增加速度

一，你看看自由飛翔，沒有硝煙的痕跡

506
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
羅傑說2

507
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
我抄，我進近跑道21

508
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
繼你

509
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
我們要去0-2-0

510
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
好吧，你是自由的

511
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
美味11，檢查你的速度。

512
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,100
我再說一遍，保持控制。

513
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
避免失速。

514
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,300
1，檢查你的標題。你不會使跑道！

515
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
我知道了。

516
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
這是一個著陸先生的地獄！

517
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
沒想到我們要去做到！

518
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
我會開始收費這個東西，好嗎？

519
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
聽我說？

520
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,100
嘿，讓我知道你需要什麼。

521
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:03,100
電視：什麼似乎令人難以置信的是，在飛機上的所有乘客生還！

522
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
喂，是你嗎？

523
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,400
你是飛行員？玷污？這是你的，對嗎？

524
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,800
很高興見到你。

525
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,600
這是不真實的，你最後一天做了什麼。這是一個真正的高興見到你

526
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,200
我們得到了一個飲料後，只要我如願以償了。是不是啊曼尼？

527
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:38,000
是啊是啊，你這樣做！薩利！灰雁的拍攝，與水濺。

528
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,200
到1月15日！

529
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
每天最好的一年！

530
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,100
喂，彼得，蘇利在這裡，他的存在！

531
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
他是無處不在！

532
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
他是一個真正的英雄的男人！

533
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
滾滾而來，讓我們來看看他們是怎麼想！

534
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,700
沒有更多的人在船上帽，這就是它花費GW

535
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
好吧，謝謝。收到。

536
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,400
我們要進入市中心的子7。

537
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,500
我不能相信你不得不坐在地說。

538
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,200
我再說一遍，並沒有問題或猶豫。這是在棒球歷史上最好的圖片。

539
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,700
你撒謊湖人，是，它是什麼呢？或者是它的鬍子？

540
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
你只是嫉妒！

541
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,700
妒！？！

542
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
撐，撐！

543
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
低著頭，停留下來！

544
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
沒關係。

545
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
住了下來！

546
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
我並不想死！

547
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
撤離！

548
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,200
抓住你的救生衣，請

549
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
開門。

550
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,700
迷茫的尖叫聲....

551
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,500
每個人，出口是可用的。向前移動到離你最近的出口！

552
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,100
前進。在右邊有一個出口門。

553
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
爵士，撤離了飛機，現在！

554
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
冷靜下來，你會沒事的！

555
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
在這裡，這會是寒冷的外面。

556
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,000
跳！跳！

557
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
哦，我的上帝！

558
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
我們必須jump..no無需等待！

559
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
你能看到嗎？是啊

560
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
哦基督，這是一個平面。

561
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,100
五月天五月天，信道1-6，托馬斯·傑斐遜。我們在北川一客機！

562
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,100
我們在路線，我們會建議！

563
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
走吧，走吧！

564
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,400
吉米，傑夫還沒有得到出。我們不能讓他在那裡！

565
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
我們已經得到了他，我們已經得到了他！

566
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
他會好起來的！

567
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
繼續前進！

568
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
按照說明進行操作！

569
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,800
先生，先生！你能來幫我們？

570
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
大家繼續前進！

571
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,200
這架飛機的下來，我們上了翅膀乘客。

572
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
謹慎的做法

573
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,700
把毯子鋪在她的腿

574
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
你會沒事的蜂蜜，慢慢走

575
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,800
這個包裹在她的腿，使其緊。

576
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,000
它是如此寒冷在這裡。

577
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,400
開始來臨之際，我們快到了。

578
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
撿起來。

579
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
好的

580
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,300
3-2-1。這是很好的它的好！

581
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
就在那裡寶貝，加油。

582
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,400
一次一個。我們會得到大家！

583
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
我們讓他們的其他方式。

584
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
有點接近！

585
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,300
為36度的水的溫度和擋風玻璃-5

586
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,300
飛行1549倖存者從字面上設法活下去。

587
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,900
這裡爬起來，還有其他好心人來向右走，好嗎？

588
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
50碼，GO！

589
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
我會保護你這樣行嗎？好。

590
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
有人還在這裡，回來。幫我！

591
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
隊長！

592
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,400
隊長，我們得走了！

593
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
下班時間到了飛機，約吧！

594
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
好吧，讓我們去。走！

595
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
我會在後面。

596
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
蘇利，我們得走了！

597
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
每個人都好嗎？

598
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:44,200
所有這些奇跡般生還，他們發現300紐約人願意幫助他們

599
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
剩下的唯一問題是：會不會太晚了？

600
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,800
在曼哈頓鮑比庫扎，紐約一

601
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
來吧，給我你的手。來吧。

602
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
我確信我會死。

603
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
嘿，沒有人死亡的今天，好不好？

604
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,800
把你的手給我

605
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,200
你去那裡船長，這種方式！

606
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
給我你的手先生！

607
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,700
我們需要在這裡更多的毯子！

608
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,700
謝謝謝謝

609
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
是的，我們得到了他們！

610
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
你好？

611
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
我想打電話說我沒事。

612
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
哦，太好了，你還是遠離家鄉？

613
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,400
還有的是一個事件。我沒事，我只是莫名其妙地崩潰。

614
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
打開電視

615
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
你是什??麼意思，打開電視？

616
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,000
洛瑞我現在不能講，我會打電話給你當事情平靜下來。

617
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,700
我不得不降落在哈得孫河。

618
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,900
蘇利，我不明白

619
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,400
我愛你，我很好，告訴女孩，我行！

620
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,500
我得走了！

621
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,200
女孩打開電視

622
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:55,400
美國空運飛行後，廣泛的救援已經墜入哈德遜河。

623
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
哦，我的上帝。

624
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,400
把你的濕衣服脫掉，並包起來紅十字會。

625
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
你會沒事的。

626
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
傑夫！

627
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,300
玷污！

628
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,600
我需要一個損壞報告，我多麼嚴重，需要它吧！

629
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,900
155.這是我的電話號碼，那是乘客包括在內。

630
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,900
你怎麼樣？

631
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,900
我來回答這個問題的時候，你會算155。

632
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,900
好的，

633
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,700
我還活著。莎瑞，我簡直不敢相信我跟你說話。

634
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,500
船長，船長我在這裡給你護送到市長Bloomber和警察。

635
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
如果市長想打個招呼，他將不得不來這裡了。

636
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
蘇利，我拒絕與警察送你！

637
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,900
傑夫！我需要一個算！我們必須有一個算！

638
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,900
有沒有辦法給你一個計數。

639
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,200
讓我們將一個驅動器，你之前凍結。

640
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,500
隊長，市長和首席McKelly，來這裡見到你。

641
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,800
我不能，因為它是一個國內航班！

642
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,000
是的，我們毫不懷疑，但我們必須跟蹤乘客信息了。逐個！

643
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
好吧，我們可以幫助？

644
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,100
是的，我要打電話，讓你計數！

645
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,500
聽著，你已經做夠了。我願借此為您服務！

646
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
傑夫！

647
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,600
我很好。我在另一翼。

648
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,600
他們給我們帶來了澤西島！

649
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,000
我看不到你。我找不到你！

650
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
我能聽到你喊我的名字所有的時間。

651
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,700
我喊過，我不知道，我猜的河流....

652
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,700
你還好嗎？

653
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
我也愛你。

654
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,700
我們成功了！

655
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,900
飛機....飛機的墜毀！

656
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,900
在河上！

657
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
你在跟我開玩笑嗎？

658
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,400
噢，那是令人難以置信！

659
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,100
我從來沒有這麼高興在紐約我所有的生命！

660
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
嘿，貝蒂！

661
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
是不是你來嗎？

662
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,400
我猜他沒有聽到。

663
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,400
我在哈德遜船長失去1549。

664
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,900
好吧，我想你有急事，他沒有，一個王八蛋！

665
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,900
每個人都被拉開了！

666
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
這是一個奇跡！

667
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,900
我以為我失去了他們所有。

668
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
是我的乘客好嗎？

669
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,700
是的，110。

670
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,000
110.這不是好！

671
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
這是正常的，你是什麼意思這不是好？

672
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,500
別擔心，110是不同凡響！

673
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
如何Dureene？

674
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,000
Farly嚴重裂傷，但我們會繼續處理她的感染。

675
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
我敢肯定，他會沒事的。

676
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
有一個傷疤，一個故事的地獄告訴。

677
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,500
如果有人相信它，我現在看到它，我簡直不敢相信。

678
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
你降落在哈德遜河的飛機沒有劃痕...

679
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Erny ...

680
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,800
該聯盟今天拉了所有的大槍...

681
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,600
你把一個該死的風險玷污。

682
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,600
有一個計數。

683
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
155

684
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,600
155？

685
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,700
這是官方的。

686
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
哦，155。

687
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,300
謝謝Erny。

688
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
嘿，卡爾！是？

689
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,700
玷污。卡爾。

690
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
你今天沒吹起來，是嗎？

691
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
我們在這裡，這是我所知道的時刻。

692
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,700
哦，這是可能會錯過，從酒店。

693
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
想有一個快字你。

694
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,200
這不會花費太多時間，先生們，這只能說

695
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,200
我們的員工致力於保護您的隱私。

696
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,200
如果有什麼需要，在所有...

697
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,200
 

698
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,300
如果可能的話，我想我已經清理均勻，並準備。

699
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,100
你在開玩笑嗎？如果我能我想給你這個整個酒店！

700
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:52,500
好了，好了謝謝艾拉。非常感謝你。

701
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
好了，任何東西玷污！

702
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
剛剛發生了什麼？

703
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,800
您剛剛通過一個完全陌生的擁抱。

704
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,100
阿來對蘇利！

705
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,700
當是你聽到有人在水面上登陸jetplane最後一次？

706
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,900
終於活了下來？

707
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,300
究竟。

708
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:22,100
我有剃鬚膏，刀片，兩對一些衣服。

709
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,100
你覺得我們是忍者？

710
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:30,000
這是在晚上七點鐘。你找到專賣品兄弟！

711
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
是啊。

712
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
玷污。

713
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
你還在做穿制服？

714
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,100
好了，我不知道。

715
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,600
你們看，這是一個漫長的一天。你為什麼不只是得到一些休息？

716
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,600
麥克將在這裡後，以確保你ok了！

717
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
謝謝卡爾。

718
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,700
不，謝謝隊長。

719
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,100
你知道，它已經一段時間，因為紐約有消息這麼好。

720
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,100
特別是隨著飛機。

721
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
以後我會看到你玷污。

722
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
這個詞的市府官員不斷重複....

723
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,800
當然飛行員的精確計時

724
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,200
船長蘇利Sullenbenger，該名男子誰幾乎沒有時間

725
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,800
成為所有時間的人。

726
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
嘿玷污，給我....

727
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,900
來吧，回答...

728
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,000
雙拼，CBR是2天。你能多快干涉？

729
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
玷污？

730
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,200
我知道空客對A320 manifacturer模擬，但下周的。

731
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,200
你可以讓他們重新安排？

732
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,200
在上午3？

733
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,900
我需要你做到這一點，在我們聽CBR。

734
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,900
櫃前完成。

735
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,900
為什麼？

736
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,700
我看到這些仿真的權利，我有一種感覺，與人類飛行員

737
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
而不是一台計算機，其結果將是不同的。

738
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,500
如果他們表現出什麼完全相同的結果？

739
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,100
如果他們這樣做，我就上吊英吋

740
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:53,500
這是關於定時拉裡的一切。你可以做到著急什麼。

741
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
肯定是地獄我同意這一點。

742
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,100
現在CBR是在週三，這是36小時。你能做到這一點？

743
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,100
我會盡力。我給了一個電話。

744
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,500
它已經晚了，所以你最好開始。謝謝拉裡。

745
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
嘿，鸚鵡

746
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,300
你好。我很抱歉打擾你。

747
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,300
親愛的，有什麼...發生了什麼？

748
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:43,900
我才意識到，有155人上飛機，而你是其??中之一

749
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,200
我們幾乎失去了你。

750
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,400
是的，但你沒有。我在這兒。

751
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,300
你是如何高舉？

752
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,500
請告訴我，這已接近尾聲。

753
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,500
這幾乎結束了。

754
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
好的。

755
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
我愛你。

756
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,600
我也愛你

757
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
我會打電話給你時，他們和我一起做。

758
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,900
早安玷污。

759
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,900
好吧，早安女士們，先生們。我的名字是查爾斯·波特

760
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,300
我已經從美國國家運輸安全，以便在今天進行這次聽證會分配

761
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,100
我們有很多的材料覆蓋。

762
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:07,900
但在此之前我們聽到駕駛艙錄音，我們會聽取了在第一時間與您紳士。

763
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:16,300
對於Sullenberger機長和聯盟的請求，空中客車公司已同意以查看飛行員模擬。

764
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
上傳鏈接，請。

765
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:23,200
這些模擬玷污，也不會改變的事情發生了那裡我的腦海裡。

766
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,200
鳥類！

767
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
1號是回滾！

768
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,200
自動駕駛的關閉。

769
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,200
飛行員關閉。

770
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
飛行指揮的了。

771
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,000
拉瓜迪亞機場，由於引擎故障，我們不得不返回

772
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,600
好吧，我要左轉到拉瓜迪亞機場3。

773
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,600
激活你的辦法。

774
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
活性。

775
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
13號跑道

776
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,200
讓我們坐下很好。

777
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
*報警*太低。

778
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,900
成功的降落在拉瓜迪亞。 13號跑道

779
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
備案：飛行員的和計算機的模擬取得了同樣的結果。

780
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,600
其次上傳請，有關第二輪？

781
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
鳥類。

782
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
給我3-1-0標題

783
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
標題3-1-0。

784
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
千。

785
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
太襟翼

786
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
襟翼了。

787
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
*報警*太低

788
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
成功的著陸，跑道19

789
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,800
多個機場，跑道，兩名成功的著陸

790
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,000
我們只是看到的計算機已經告訴我們。

791
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,900
很多腳趾，以設置這為今天被踩到。

792
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,400
但坦率地說，我真的不知道你的先生們通過玩遊戲。

793
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,400
現在我們可以認真的嗎？

794
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
隊長？

795
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,300
我們都聽說了計算機模擬，現在我們在看實際模擬，但

796
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
我不太相信。

797
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,800
你根本就沒有考慮到人的因素。

798
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,200
人類飛行員模擬表明，你可以使人們回機場。

799
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,200
不，他們沒有。

800
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:26,200
這些飛行員??的行為不像人一樣。就像誰是首次遇到這個人。

801
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,200
但他們提出了對像你這樣的反應。

802
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,100
鳥擊後立即，他們義無反顧機場。正確？

803
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,100
那是對的。

804
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,100
他們知道要找誰，並準確知道在哪裡飛。

805
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,100
他們沒有運行檢查，他們沒有打開APU

806
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,900
有所有你面臨同樣的paremeters。

807
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,900
沒有人警告我們。

808
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:51,600
沒有人說：你要在一個較低的海拔，任何飛機在歷史上失去兩個引擎。

809
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:58,500
但要冷靜，讓只是一個左轉到拉瓜迪亞像你回去拿起牛奶。

810
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:10,800
這是在2800英尺隨後立即水上降落的雙引擎虧損。船上155的靈魂，沒有人訓練了一個事件這樣。

811
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
沒有人！

812
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,800
在泰特波羅登陸，與unrealistick靠背角度，我們沒有發現鳥兒在那裡。

813
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:24,500
我想知道飛行員多少次的練習之前耍花招居然把它關閉。

814
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,400
我不是質疑飛行員，他們是很好的飛行員。

815
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,500
但他們明確指示了鳥擊後立即後腦勺機場。

816
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,400
你就沒有時間去分析這個決定。

817
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,200
在這些模擬你把所有的人類出艙。

818
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:49,200
多少時間做了飛行員不得不為這個事件做準備，這些模擬？

819
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
你要找的人的空氣。

820
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
然後使之人性化。

821
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
這不是一個視頻遊戲。

822
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,800
這是生命和死亡。

823
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,300
薩利的權利，這是值得幾秒鐘。

824
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,600
請讓練習者多少他們了。

825
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
17

826
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
17？

827
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:32,000
誰在泰特波羅降落飛行員有17個實踐的嘗試，我們剛剛目睹模擬之前。

828
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,800
你的反應決策時間為35秒。

829
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,300
35秒不是我們的時間。

830
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:48,700
我們只有208秒總讓....我要了。

831
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,200
上傳鏈接，返回拉瓜迪亞。

832
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,700
現在，我們增加了35秒的響應時間。

833
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,900
鳥類！

834
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,900
煤氣關閉。

835
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
35秒。

836
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,200
時間到。

837
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
開始了。

838
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
展望13。

839
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
我們正前方的機場。

840
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
*報警*注意，障礙

841
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
我們大約7英里遠。

842
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
*報警*注意，障礙

843
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
*報警*地形！地形！

844
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
*報警*太低了！地形！

845
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
讓我們試試泰特波羅。

846
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,200
上傳的鏈接請。

847
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,400
鳥類！

848
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
飛行指揮了。

849
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
35秒。

850
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,500
引擎1和2的失敗。

851
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,700
讓我們看看，如果我們可以做到這一點。

852
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
太低。

853
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
*報警*障礙！障礙！

854
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
有沒有人需要看到更多的模擬？

855
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,200
現在我們看到的可能發生，我們可以聽一下我們實際上做了？

856
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,300
我們將著眼於在另一個日期其他結果。

857
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,300
伊麗莎白。

858
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:26,000
根據記錄，這是1549航班，2009年1月15日的CVR。

859
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
鳥類！

860
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
拉屎！

861
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,600
我們得到了一個滾動回

862
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,200
我們有兩個人回滾。

863
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,800
點火啟動。

864
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,400
走出QRH。

865
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,400
失去了發動機。

866
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,100
五月天五月天，我們失去了兩個引擎，我們正在轉向拉瓜迪亞。

867
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,100
好吧，你需要求助於拉瓜？左轉220。

868
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,100
你失去它的發動機？

869
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
在這兩方面，這兩款發動機。

870
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,400
檢查這些飛行點火。

871
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,400
點火？點火。

872
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,400
推力打火機。閒？閒。

873
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,600
船長1549你想嘗試跑道13的土地？

874
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,400
我們不能，我們正試圖降落在哈得孫河。

875
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,800
應急電源。應急發電機不在線。不在線。

876
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,900
船長的1549，這會是跑道31無法

877
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,900
好吧，你在哪裡需要降落？

878
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
你有10秒隊長。跟我說話。

879
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,900
船長1549，跑道4是可用的。

880
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,900
我不認為我們可以做任何的跑道。

881
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,100
凡是在新澤西，也許泰特波羅？

882
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,100
我馬上側泰特波羅機場。

883
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,800
拉瓜迪亞出發？有一個緊急入境。

884
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,300
船長1549他在機場馬上去。

885
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,300
你有緊急情況？

886
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,300
是啊，鳥擊，我能得到跑道1-1？

887
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,200
船長1549，想與泰特波羅試試？

888
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:47,100
*報警*障礙，障礙。拉起！

889
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
*報警*太低，地形！

890
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,900
這是隊長，支具衝擊力！

891
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,000
船長3-0 1549右轉。您可以降落在1-0！

892
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
我們不能做到這一點。

893
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,400
來吧，嘗試號碼1。

894
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
我們將在哈德森結束。

895
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
好吧，讓我們把襟翼下來，襟翼下來。

896
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
襟翼的情侶，想要更多？

897
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,500
不，這是很好的。

898
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,500
您在紐瓦克機場跑道了2-9，這會是2點左右，7英里。

899
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,300
你有什麼想法？

900
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,300
其實都不是。

901
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
我需要採取快速突破。

902
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,400
他們認為是什麼？

903
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
眼看我剛才做了什麼？

904
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,700
我會告訴你我的想法。

905
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,700
我只是這麼該死的驕傲。

906
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:07,000
你是在那裡，與所有那些分心。

907
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
我們這樣做在一起像一個團隊。

908
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,900
由於薩利。

909
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,900
我們做我們的工作。

910
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,500
好吧，我們必須讓這次聽證會回秩序。

911
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
你能解決嗎？

912
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,600
把你的座位。

913
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,200
這是說實話，我第一次是聽崩潰記錄。

914
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:08,400
同時與機長和副駕駛坐著實際。這是非凡的。

915
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,800
這是沒有模擬？

916
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,100
不，它不是。

917
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:22,300
先生們，我想告訴你，左發動機恢復。

918
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,800
我只是進行了全面的報告。

919
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:35,500
有發動機的風扇葉片廣泛損害，5壓縮機葉片均斷裂。

920
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,100
和8天線脈失蹤。

921
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
因此，沒有推力。

922
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,800
當你作證，它被完全摧毀。

923
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,900
該機的數據是錯誤的。

924
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,100
我想的東西添加到個人註釋：

925
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:01,800
我可以絕對的信心說，與其他船員溝通後

926
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,800
鳥類專家，航空工程師，跑步到每一個方案後，

927
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:13,200
運行的每個球員後，仍然有意外的結果..

928
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:21,800
它是你，Sullenberger機長，從數學方程去除你，只是失敗。

929
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,300
我不同意。

930
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,800
它不只是我，這是我們所有的人。傑夫，唐娜，新羅和Dureene。

931
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,400
和所有的乘客，救援人員。

932
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:42,000
和交通控制，直升機機組人員和水肺警察。

933
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,800
我們都做到了！

934
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,300
我們活了下來。

935
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,900
副駕駛老八，你有什麼想補充的嗎？

936
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:02,900
什麼，你會做不同的，如果你不得不再做一次嗎？

937
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,400
是的，我會在七月做到了！

938
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:50,200
字幕：Sergeddu

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Flight 1549, Clear to take off.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Flight 1549, Ready to take off

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Mayday, Mayday, Captain 1549,
It was opened

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Opened

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No rely on motor 2

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Captain 1549,
We can get a view on runway 13

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,100
We can't make it,
We're turning back to La Guardia

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
La Guardia Tower, Flight 1549
We're going to try to make 13

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sully, We are too low

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sully, We are too low!

11
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Come on!

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
It's  set on fire!

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Come on!

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Sully

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Lory I love you!

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What the hell is the matter with you?

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everyone, EVERYONE survived on flight 1549!

18
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,000
You think you'll die,
that's what you think

19
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,800
And then, miraculously you don't!

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Thank you Captain, Thank you!

21
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Thank you!

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Thank you Captain Sullbenger for being here today.

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I would also welcome First Officer Skiles

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Glad you made it at this point.

25
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Not aswell as  we are.

26
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
For the record,
We have an aircraft system investigation,

27
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
and also aircraft structures, MRT

28
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Aircraft perfomance, ATCS, life factors,
survival factors

29
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
nd also emergency response
Today we begin

30
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,100
with our operations,
human performance and investigations.

31
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
On the crash of US Flight 1549

32
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
The water landing.

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,700
Captain?

34
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
This was not a crash, it was a water landing.

35
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
We knew what we were trying to execute

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,500
It was not a crash, it was a forced water landing.

37
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,200
Why didn't you attempt to return to La Guardia?

38
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,300
There was simply not enough altitude

39
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,900
The Hudson was the only place long enough
and smooth enough and wide enough to attempt a landing.

40
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,400
Air traffic testified that you were returning
to La Guardia but you did not.

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,600
As I began the left turn,

42
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,800
I realized I couldn't make it back
and I would have eliminated other options

43
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,200
Returning to La Guardia would have been a mistake.

44
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,700
Let's get into how you calculated all those parameters.

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,700
There was no time for calculating.

46
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,200
I have relied on my experience on managing the altitude and speed
on thousand of flights over four decades.

47
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,300
You say you didn't calculated...

48
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
I attempted.

49
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
- You attempted.

50
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Yes.

51
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,300
The best chance passengers had was on that.

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,400
And I bet my life on it.
In fact, I did!

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
And I would do it again.

54
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Aviation engineers theorize you had enough energy to get back to the runway.

55
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Engineers are not pilots.
They're wrong.

56
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,600
And they weren't there.

57
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Regardless, we have to follow all implications
as part of the investigation.

58
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Our computers analized scenarios

59
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,100
run algorithms, write
simulations with the exact parameters.

60
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
the engine loss,
the altitude, everything you faced

61
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
when you made your decision.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
I would like to oversee those computer simulations

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Not possible during the investigation.

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
You staid it was a dual engine failure

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
due to multiple blows with birds?

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
That would be unprecedented!

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,600
Everything is unprecedented, until it happens for the first time.

68
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
How much sleep did you get the night before?

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Eight hours, enough.

70
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,400
It was possible that blood sugar was low?

71
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,900
I was rested, alerted, and completely aware of my surroundings.

72
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,800
When was your last dring, Captain Sullenbenger?

73
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Nine days ago.

74
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
Droghe?

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
No, mai.

76
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,200
First Officer Skiles?

77
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
I don't drink, I never have.

78
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Captain,

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,500
 have you had any troubles at home lately?

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Well, not more than anyone else.

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
And nothing that affected my work.

82
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Bullshit.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,300
But why are they looking for something we did wrong?

84
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,700
That turned out right.

85
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,700
It didn't turned out right for the Airline and their insurance company.

86
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
We should expect some blowback.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Oh like what they can say?

88
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
That we shouldn't have saved everybody?

89
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,300
That's not personal.

90
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
The're just doing their job.

91
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,400
Relax, calm down.

92
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Sully, they should give you a medal

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
and send you back to work.

94
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Sorry, this mailbox is full.

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,400
I didn't called Lori this morning, I'm guessing someone  else did

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say:

97
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,100
It is an honor driving you today.

98
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Thank you.

99
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,700
What new have said so far? Two building went down,

100
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Many millions without work, and that's the first weeks of January.

101
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
But today's headlines:

102
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
This is beautiful!

103
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Hey Mike, why don't we get the driver as a character witness?

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Finally.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, finally.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The Airline has given us trapped all day.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,500
It's just... I need to hear your voice.

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I've heared everybody else's.

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,100
It doesn't feel much like family.

111
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
It isn't quiet here too.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,100
There are reporters asking for an update.

113
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Inside the mind of Sully.

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Lori, tell them you can't talk.

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I cannot hear you, just call me later.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
You don't have to talk with them.

117
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Call me back.

118
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
Do you've got any news?

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Have you achiedeved the impossible?

120
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I think there's the press with a car.

121
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,400
Self-Defense, think the juror would convinct?

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Do what you have to do.

123
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
No, I'm asking for permission.

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Cops will be coming after you.

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
Sully what are you doing?

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Sully, are you listening to me?

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
We should talk later.

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I've been reading all day.

129
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
Are you okay?

130
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Yeah, I'm just tired, that's all.

131
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
How are the girls?

132
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Oh good.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
A bit overwhelmed, sounds like you are too.

134
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Yeah, I'll be alright.

135
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
The whole world is talking about you.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sully, I can't believe this.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Lori, I'll have to stay here,

138
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,900
Until the investigation is over,
Did I tell that already?

139
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
And I apologize if I didn't told you already.

140
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You don't need to apologize,
You're right where you need to be.

141
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
You know, I did the best I could.

142
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Of course you did.

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You saved everyone.

144
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Maybe we should just talk in the morning.

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm tired.

146
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm overwhelmed by all these attentions.

147
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,900
I'm gonna be on TV next Morning,
what are they gonna ask me?

148
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,100
Sully do you want me to come be with you?

149
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
No Lori

150
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
The girls need you.

151
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Tell them I love them.

152
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
I love you.

153
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
Get some sleep.

154
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,500
Yeah, maybe when I'll wake up it'll be January 14th.

155
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Wouldn't that be good?

156
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I love you.

157
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Why did Captain Sully made that faithful decision to turn the Hudson into a runway?

158
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Well, only he can answer.

159
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
But we now know, it was a wrong choice.

160
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,700
A choice that endangered the lives of all of those on board.

161
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,000
So, while much of the country hails him as a hero

162
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,000
this new information will certainly change everyone's understanding
of the so called Miracle on the Hudson

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Sully Sullenberger, are you a hero,
or a fraud?

164
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,500
Hello?

165
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Jeff? Sorry for calling you so late.

166
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
It's ok, There's no sleep in this room either.

167
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Can you believe they charged 5 dollars for a Snickers?

168
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,600
I can take the Airline to bankruptcy with four bites.

169
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I thought you may wanna talk!
-Absolutely

170
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Let's get some air.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Great

172
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
I will be there in 5 minutes.

173
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Enjoying the shakes?

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Nightmares? Little Heartbeat?

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A little bit.
The Union is offering us Counseling.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Yeah, what would you say?
You were in a plane crash and lived.

177
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
It might have an impact in your day to day.

178
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
I don't like not being in control of the process.

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
I won myself that

180
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,300
Within 6 months we'll laugh about
as we know David Letterman

181
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
We're doing David Letterman?

182
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Yeah, right after next week's interview.

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm guessing David's gonna be excited for you.

184
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
This is so surreal.

185
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,400
I guess I'm having some problems in separating reality
 from whatever the hell this is.

186
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Yeah, this is two man freezing their asses off

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Sully,
Don't worry, you did a great day.

188
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
It's gonna be remembered for a very long time.

189
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Here's a funny thing:

190
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,900
I've delivered over a million passengers
over 40 years in the air

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,800
But in the end I'lm gonna be judged for 208 seconds

192
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
Come on, tomorrow it's gonna be a good day.

193
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,200
Computers will prove you're right,
and you'll put your wings back on

194
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
You wanna run?

195
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Yeah, let's run.

196
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Fucking cold out here.

197
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,600
This was obvious,
it was a critical situation

198
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Losing both engines at a low altitude

199
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Over one of the most populated areas of the planet

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,000
But you chose to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big IF

201
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,700
I was sure I could do it

202
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,500
You were?

203
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
Yes.

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
How do you feel when people call you a hero?

205
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,800
I don't feel like a hero.
I'm just a man who is doing his job.

206
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,700
The right man for the job
at the right time

207
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,500
You've been flying for what?
Nearly 40 years?

208
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,400
42, That's been my life

209
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,600
My whole life

210
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Aircraft

211
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,800
Bomb-craft

212
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,800
I'll be busy son, so you
keep the plane clean please.

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,000
They are $ 6 per hour
Consider it a lesson time

214
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,200
Pilots never stop to acquire knwledge.
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,100
Never forget, no matter what's happening,
to fly the airplane.

216
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Absolutely, sir!

217
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
One other thing, and this is important!
Sir?

218
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
You can smile !

219
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Alright!

220
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,400
I apologize for my sweating.

221
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh no, After all you did I don't think
Katie could be more intimidating

222
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh that wasn't Katie, It was the light
and the camera you brought in.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Ok, we're done.

224
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,600
That was from my mom.

225
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,600
Her name's Brenda,
She told me to say thank you and she's single!

226
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,800
Well, tell Brenda thank you,
but I got a girl at home.

227
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Lucky woman

228
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Sully, SULLY!

229
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,400
Sully, where are you?

230
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm standing here calling your name.

231
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
What's up with you?

232
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,600
You need to get focused, because the media
requests Avalanche continues.

233
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,600
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in and run Shotgun
 with you the rest of the way

235
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Thought you might need a friend.

236
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
He will take you to NTSB now.

237
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,700
AirBus completed computer simulations aswell

238
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Good, Good, that will help!

239
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
There's something else

240
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,600
The Agency called,
The left engine was still operating

241
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,100
Not possible, I felt it go.
It was like it stopped in mid-air.

242
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
They said there's a chance it was sub-idle.

243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,100
I'm just letting you know, since
the NTSB already does.

244
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
You've got to be kidding me.

245
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Our job is to investigate.
Our plane ended up in the Hudson River.

246
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
Isn't it a little bit early for you
to go fishing?

247
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,700
Searching facts is not exactly go fishing,
Mr Skiles,

248
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's see the most important fact:
There were only two people who know what happened

249
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
in the cockpit that day,
and I'm one of them.

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
And we appreciate your perspective.

251
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Why are we here today?

252
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,500
Is it because Captain Sullenberger
did not return to La Guardia?

253
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,200
Look, I just finished training on the AR320,
And I can tell you the only reason the plane operated so well

254
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Is because the Captain turned on
The auxiliary power unit on

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He simply followed the QRH

256
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,400
No, no he wasn't.
He wasn't following proper procedure at all.

257
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
And I know because I had the QRH in my hands.

258
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,300
He switched to APU immediately after engine blowback.
According to the Airbus that's the 15th thing to do.

259
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,900
If he followed the damn rules, we would be dead.

260
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,700
Maybe that's the part you don't like.
You have answers to your guessing

261
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,800
Look, he's just saying that I held the AR320 what it does
and  what it does to do

262
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,600
I held recountless CVR transcripts of deceased pilots and I have
significant accident investigation experience.

263
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,100
There is no question that you're a talented,
dedicated, experienced professional.

264
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,100
Every crash investigated before are not object of this investigation.
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

265
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:12,500
Your Union has been advised, The data relate that the
left engine continued setting himself on during flight.

266
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Then the Data is wrong

267
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,900
The evidence showed that the engine was Idle or Sub-Idle
immediately following the bird strike.

268
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,500
You show me the left engine
I show you dead birds and no power

269
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,800
The left engine was lost in the crash,
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

270
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
We could circle back to that later,

271
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,300
Let's just assume, as you say,
a dual engine loss.

272
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:46,700
Your weight was 151.510 pounds, wind and temperature, nort, north-west, 21 degrees,
speed and altitude 200 nods and 2818 feet.

273
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Correct.

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:57,300
The computer simulations of US Airways Flight 1549 showed that
 the Aviation Engineers were correct.

275
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,000
There was enough speed and altitude after the bird strike
for a succesful return to La Guardia

276
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Succesful?

277
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,500
The plane landed at LaGuardia intact, undamaged.

278
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
You got that from one computer simulation?

279
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
No, 20.

280
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:27,500
Including attempts made from LaGuardia runways.
Every Computer simulation with the exact flight parameters

281
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,200
demonstrated that return to LaGuardia was possible.
And not just possible, probable.

282
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Does anyone here needs further computer evidence?

283
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Captain Sullenberger?

284
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
First Officer Skiles?

285
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,700
Not this time.
I would like to go over the parameters.

286
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,900
We'll make them available for the Union.

287
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,800
And once the Investigation is complete,
we'll be able to share the actual computer simulations

288
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,000
For now, they remain confidential.
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

289
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
There has been far too much talk for the press already.

290
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:22,100
When the complete cockpit voice is compiled, alongside with onboard
transcripts we'll call you back .

291
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,200
Thank you gentlemen.
Good day.

292
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Thank you.

293
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
We weren't playing Pac-Man,
we were flying a plane for human beings.

294
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,800
Some other, will have to remember it.
This just doesn't seem right

295
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,700
It's because this is not right
You did everything you could, that's more than enough.

296
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Ask your passengers, Ask your wife and kids.
Ask Lori

297
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,200
So what's the first thing you heard from the cockpit?

298
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Brace for impact

299
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,400
Now, ever heard of that before?

300
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
No, actually no

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Ever heard of that in any aspect of your life?

302
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Take this show away from me.

303
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,400
Jeff was relaxed and fine.
He should be getting over with other requests.

304
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,500
Are they paying you?
For all this media stuff at least?

305
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
No payment is necessary.

306
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, I wish the bank felt the same way

307
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Why? What do you mean?

308
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,100
That's just....
We got another notice.

309
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
About the Space in View County.

310
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,900
Well, we'll find a tenant.
It just takes time.

311
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,300
You've been saying that for 9 months, Sully
It's still vacant

312
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
The economy has to take a turn.

313
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,600
It feels like, if we lose that space, the next
thing will be the house.

314
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
Lori, we're not gonna lose the house.

315
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'm sorry.

316
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,800
I'm sorry, I'm just anxious, and alone and
not enough sleep.

317
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,300
Yeah, I didn't get enough sleep either.

318
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm sorry adding to your stress but,
Just tell me you'll be back soon.

319
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,000
Well not until the NTSB has finished
the investigation.

320
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We need you flying.

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,900
Lori, If this goes wrong, my career as safety expert,
will end, as the website and the business card.

322
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,500
I'm more worried about your career as a pilot.

323
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
What if I did blow this?

324
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
What are you saying?

325
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
What if I did things wrong, closing my career?

326
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,900
If I endangered the lives of those passengers.

327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Sully, Watch the news!

328
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
You're a hero!

329
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,400
And everyone is going to get used to it,
Including the NTSB.

330
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,000
First case scenario:
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

331
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,900
That's immediate retirement, no pension.

332
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
My life is done.

333
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,500
Ok you're scaring me now, Sully.
What's going on?

334
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,800
The left engine might have still been idle-ing.

335
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,600
And the AirBus Simulations said I could still have made it back
to La Guardia safely.

336
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,100
But it doesn't make sense.

337
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,000
That's in discussion with everything I felt in the cockpit.

338
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,600
Then why did you do that Sully?

339
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,400
A land in the water?
That's not the much dangerous thing you could have done!

340
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Good afternoon.

341
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,100
The Tuna Vasel or The Heaven Shatter.

342
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
Tuna Vasel, Very Fresh!

343
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Thank you

344
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,200
Too cold today, too much cold!

345
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,900
When are you gonna come fly with me?

346
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
When U.S. Airways starts to fly to Hidro-Bar.

347
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,900
I will talk, see if can work.

348
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,500
This is Thursday!

349
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,000
Suitcase is already stuffed with gifts for Will.

350
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,800
Always fun to get things in the Airport.
Seems you travel too.

351
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,200
Mom, he's turning 1.
Don't think he can know what gift came from where.

352
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
But I will.

353
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Maybe a Snow Globe.

354
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,500
Something he will remember.
Something from New York.

355
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
You forgot when we were kids?

356
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,600
Okay sweetheart, I'll get you a Snow Globe too.

357
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Fine. Come on.

358
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Good afternoon.

359
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Captain.

360
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey guys, Jeff!
We're not gonna make it!

361
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,800
I believed in you for this trip,
Just meet us at the Gate ok?

362
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Altimeters verified, 3023.

363
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
3023.

364
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,100
Checklist complete.

365
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,200
You really think there are recess?

366
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,400
Checking the latests reports, We could
make it all the way to Charlotte.

367
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,100
From steaks to Frisco, on me.

368
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,300
I've never been.And I hear good things

369
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,700
Oh, Rhubarb will break your heart.

370
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, I'm more like Porker House man.

371
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Porker House will stop your heart.

372
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,800
Wait, Wait Wait!

373
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,000
Hi, I'm sorry, Spirit sent us.
We cancelled and you said you have seats.

374
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Flight is closed.

375
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Wait, see that guy, looking up there?

376
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,600
That's my Dad, it's an emergency.
He's got to be on this flight.

377
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Okay, everybody say the same.

378
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Golf emergency.
Did it go cancelled?

379
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,600
IDs please.

380
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
How many travelling?
3.

381
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,900
Nothing together.
We'll find a way.

382
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,300
Here we go: 22A, 6A and 6C

383
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Thank you so much!

384
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Glad you made it!

385
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,500
You're on 6 Jeff.
Oh no that's Jimmy, I'm gonna get some sleep.

386
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,900
Are you going to sleep here?
Not close to you.

387
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Yo, yo, Goodnight!

388
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Sorry, Excuse Me.

389
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Yeah, of course.

390
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,100
I'm sorry, he likes to throw everything.
That's perfect, I like to catch everything.

391
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,900
I googled you last night.
Found you on the company's website.

392
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,400
That's impressive.
Thanks.

393
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,500
I thought I was a good bullshitter, but you!
You could go Pro!

394
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:20,300
Just kidding, but your site do not worry
 about 100 employees and headquarters in 3 states

395
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,200
When searching for more, I realized that it was just you.

396
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,500
Now, go easy. I'm just getting it done.

397
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,100
I've never been acused being a bullshitter.

398
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,600
Do not misunderstand!
It is a compliment.

399
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,900
Now, with that website, I know you!

400
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, welcome on board
US Airways Flight 1549.

401
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:53,100
Get sure to follow the safety instructions card on seatback in front of you,
explains safety features on thi aircraft, aswell as locations of emergency exits.

402
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,500
La Guardia, this is 1549, ready for clearance

403
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,200
Ok 1549, 128 ready and protected.

404
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Get sure to turn that off.

405
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Just once I'd like to go to La Guardia in time.

406
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,700
Well you know hot to get to La Guardia.

407
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
No, what's that?

408
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Fly at JFK.

409
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Take-out fuel quality verified.

410
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,100
19000 Cargo aboard.

411
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Captain's 1549, Runway 4, Clear to take-off.

412
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,800
Captain's 1549,  Clear to take-off.

413
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Positive rig

414
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Nice view on the Hudson

415
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
I can't get over on how beautiful is up here.

416
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Life's easier in the air.

417
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
I guess, it is.

418
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,300
BIRDS!

419
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh shit!

420
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
I'm worried, what's going on?

421
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
It's okay.

422
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
It might be a good idea to keep your seatbelts on.

423
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
We've got one rolling back.

424
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,600
We have both rolling back.

425
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Ignition start.

426
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Restarting APU.

427
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Just double check your seatbelts please.

428
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Seatbelts.

429
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,200
What do you think it was?
I think it was a bird strike.

430
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
We'll have to turn back to La Guardia.
Yeah.

431
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Get out the QRH

432
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
We've lost both engines.

433
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
Mayday, mayday this is Captain 1549, we hit birds.

434
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,500
We've lost both engines, we're turning back to La Guardia.

435
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Ok, you need to return to La Guardia?

436
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Turn left at 220.

437
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Which engine did you lose?

438
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Both, both engines.

439
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Soup, I have an emergency.

440
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
What's the report?

441
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Both engines, both engines gone.

442
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,700
LaGuardia says go to runway 13

443
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,200
Tower, stop your departures, we've got an emergency returning.
Flight 1549, bird strike.

444
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
We've lost both engines, return immediately.

445
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
He lost both engines.

446
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,000
Captain 1549, if you can get a view, do you want to try land on runway 13?

447
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
We are unable. We'll end up in the Hudson.

448
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,800
I've got an A320 diving in the river.
Al, stack the inbounds in La Guardia.

449
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
Let's put a load in the Tower please.

450
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,000
I need a runway, Captain 1549 needs to get in an airport right now.

451
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Newer Tower, what did you got?
Runway 29 ready. Need an emergency landing?

452
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes, I'll be right side as Ftaburogh

453
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Shit.

454
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,700
This is the Captain
Brace for impact.

455
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,700
What?
Brace, Brace, Brace

456
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Heads down, stay down!

457
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,300
Brace, Brace, Brace

458
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,900
Heads down, stay down!

459
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,800
Captain 1549, turn right to 3-0.
You can land on run way 1 0 now.

460
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
That's negative, We're landing in the Hudson.

461
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,900
I'm sorry, say again?

462
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Captain 1549, radar contact lost.

463
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
IC, come on over here.

464
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,000
I've got also a newer copy at 2 o'clock, about 7 miles.

465
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,900
Captain 1549, if you can, you got runway 29
available at 2 o'clock, 7 miles.

466
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm sorry Patrick.

467
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
No, he's about to Newark, he's just out of the box.

468
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Hook'em back up.

469
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
We need authorized news.

470
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,600
Attention all aircraft in vicinity of JW,

471
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,100
We see the USS ship...
1549, low over the Hudson

472
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I got eyes on him

473
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,700
Ok
Hang on the chopper visuals.

474
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
He's out there.

475
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,800
He's heading to Newark, 7 miles.
Only 7 miles.

476
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,300
Captain's 1549, this is Departure Control,
On Guard, do you read?

477
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
It's going down

478
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Captain's 1549, do you read me?

479
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,300
Shit, it's going down!
It's gonna hit the water!

480
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Testers are gonna come down.

481
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Meet Eliza, it's the standard.

482
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
His voice was so calm!

483
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,300
When he said the Hudson, I wouldn't believe it!

484
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,900
This isn't happening.

485
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,700
We have took out survivors on water landings, didn't we?

486
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Embrace

487
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
I better go.

488
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,000
I am so sorry.
I love you.

489
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
Yeah, I gotta go.

490
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,300
Choosing to land in the Hudson was a big IF!

491
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:39,000
The evidence showed that a return to LaGuardia was possible.
The left engine was sub-idle

492
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,600
This is tasty 11
I have an emergency landing by breakdown

493
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Roger that.

494
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Looks like hydraulics.

495
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Sir, we need to catch up.

496
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Running a control test.

497
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
We need more altitude.

498
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Tower, this is Tacy 11 with flight control

499
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,100
Roger that, turn left for 2-2-0

500
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Unable

501
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay, proceed straight for about 2 1

502
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
2 1, thanks a lot

503
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
2 1, Increasing speed

504
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500


505
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
One, you look free to fly, no trace of smoke

506
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Roger that 2

507
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I copied, I approach runway 21

508
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Following you in

509
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
We're heading 0-2-0

510
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Ok, you're free

511
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Tasty 11, check your speed.

512
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,100
I repeat, maintain control.

513
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Avoiding to stall.

514
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,300
1, check your heading.
You're not going to make the runway!

515
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,300
I got it.

516
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
That was a hell of a landing sir!

517
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Didn't think we were gonna make it!

518
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm gonna start charging for this stuff, alright?

519
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Hear me?

520
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,100
Hey, let me know if you need anything.

521
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:03,100
TV: What seems incredible is that
all passengers in the plane survived!

522
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Hey, is that you?

523
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,400
Are you a pilot? Sully?
This is you, right?

524
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,800
It's a pleasure to meet you.

525
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,600
That was unreal what you did last day.
It's a real pleasure to meet you

526
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,200
We got a drink after you, as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right Manny?

527
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah yeah, you did!
The Sully! A shot of Grey Goose, with a splash of water.

528
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,200
To January 15th!

529
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
Best day in the year!

530
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,100
Hey Pete, Sully's here, and he's there!

531
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
He's everywhere!

532
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
He's a real hero man!

533
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Keep coming, let's see how  they want!

534
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,700
No more people on board Cap,that's what it takes for GW

535
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,700
Alright, thanks. Roger that.

536
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,400
We're heading into Midtown in Sub-7.

537
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,500
I cannot believe you had to sat to say that.

538
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,200
I'd say it again, and with no question or hesitation.
It was the best picture in history of baseball.

539
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,700
Are you lying about the Lakers, is that what it is?
Or is it the mustache?

540
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
You're just jealous!

541
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,700
Jealous!?!

542
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Brace, Brace!

543
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Heads down, stay down!

544
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's ok.

545
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Stay down!

546
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I don't wanna die!

547
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Evacuate!

548
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,200
Grab your life vests please

549
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Opening door.

550
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,700
Confused screams....

551
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,500
Everyone, exits are usable. Move forward to your closest exit!

552
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,100
Move forward.
On the right there's an exit door.

553
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Sir, Evacuate the plane right now!

554
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Calm down, you'll be fine!

555
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Here, it's gonna be cold out there.

556
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,000
Jump!
Jump!

557
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Oh my god!

558
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
We have to jump..no no Wait!

559
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Can you see this?
Yeah

560
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Oh Christ, that's a plane.

561
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,100
Mayday Mayday, Channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson.
We have a passenger airliner in the north river!

562
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,100
We're in route, we will advise!

563
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
Let's go, Let's go!

564
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,400
Jimmy, Jeff has not got out.
We can't leave him there!

565
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
We've got him, We've got him!

566
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
He will be okay!

567
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Keep moving forward!

568
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Follow the instructions!

569
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,800
Sir, Sir! Can you come help us?

570
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,400
Everyone keep moving forward!

571
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,200
The plane's down, we got passengers on the wings.

572
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Approach with caution

573
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,700
Put a blanket on her legs

574
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
You will be fine honey, go slowly

575
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,800
Wrap this around her leg, make it tight.

576
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,000
It's so cold out here.

577
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,400
Starting approaching, we're nearly there.

578
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
Pick it up.

579
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Alright

580
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,300
3-2-1. It's good It's good!

581
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Right there baby, Come on.

582
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,400
One at a time.
We'll get everybody!

583
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
We're getting them on the other way.

584
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
A little bit closer!

585
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,300
With a water temperature of 36 degrees and a windshield of -5

586
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,300
the survivors of flight 1549 literally have managed to live.

587
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,900
Get up here, there are other good people coming right away, ok?

588
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
50 yards, GO!

589
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I'll keep you like that ok?
Ok.

590
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Someone is still here, Come back.
Help me!

591
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Captain!

592
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Captain, We have to go!

593
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,400
Time to get off the plane, about now!

594
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Alright let's go. GO!

595
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,200
I'll be right behind.

596
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Sully, we got to go!

597
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Everybody's okay?

598
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:44,200
All of them miraculously survived and they found
300 New Yorkers ready to help them

599
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
The only question remaining is: Will it be too late?

600
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,800
In Manhattan Bobby Cuza, New York One

601
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on.

602
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I was sure I was gonna die.

603
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Hey, no one dies today, ok?

604
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,800
Give me your hand

605
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,200
There you go Captain, this way!

606
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
Give me your hands sir!

607
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,700
We'll need more blankets over here!

608
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,700
Thank you, Thank you

609
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Yeah, we got them all!

610
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Hello?

611
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

612
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Oh good, are you still far away from home?

613
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,400
There's been an incident.
I'm okay, I just crashed somehow.

614
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Turn on the television

615
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
What do you mean, turn on the television?

616
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,000
Lori I can't talk right now, I'll
call you when things calm down.

617
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,700
I had to land on the Hudson.

618
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,900
Sully, I don't understand

619
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,400
I love you and I'm ok, tell the girls I'm ok!

620
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,500
I have to go!

621
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Girls turn on the TV

622
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:55,400
An extensive rescue after a US Airway flight has crashed into the Hudson River.

623
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Oh my God.

624
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,400
Take your wet clothes off and wrap it up for the Red Cross.

625
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
You'll be okay.

626
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Jeff!

627
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,300
Sully!

628
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,600
I need a damage report, how badly and I need it NOW!

629
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,900
155. That's my number, that's passengers included.

630
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,900
Ok, How are you?

631
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,900
I'll answer that question when you'll count 155.

632
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,900
Alright,

633
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,700
I'm alive. Shary, I can't believe I'm talking to you.

634
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,500
Captain, Captain I'm here to escort you to Mayor Bloomber and Police Officers.

635
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
If the Mayor want  to say hello,he'll have to come down here.

636
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Sully, I refused to send you with a cop!

637
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,900
Jeff! I need a count!
We've got to have a count!

638
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,900
There's no way to give you a count.

639
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,200
Let's get you a drive before you freeze.

640
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,500
Captain, the Mayor and Chief McKelly, come down here to meet you.

641
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,800
I can't, because it was a domestic flight!

642
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah, we have no doubts, but we have to track the passengers informations down.
One by one!

643
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
Ok, can we help?

644
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,100
Yeah, I'm gonna call and get you a count!

645
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,500
Listen, you've done enough.
Let me take this for you!

646
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Jeff!

647
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,600
I'm okay.
I was on the other wing.

648
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,600
They brought us to Jersey!

649
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,000
I couldn't see you.
I couldn't find you!

650
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I could hear you shouted my name all time.

651
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,700
I shouted too, I don't know, I guess the river....

652
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,700
Are you okay?

653
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
I love you too.

654
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,700
We made it!

655
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,900
The plane.... the plane's crashed!

656
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,900
On the river!

657
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
Are you kidding me?

658
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,400
Oh, that's unbelievable!

659
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,100
I've never been so happy to be in New York in all my life!

660
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Hey Betty!

661
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Ain't you coming?

662
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,400
I guess he didn't hear.

663
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,400
I lost Captain 1549 in the Hudson.

664
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,900
Yeah, I guess you had a hurry, he hadn't, the son of a bitch!

665
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,900
Everyone's been pulled off!

666
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's a miracle!

667
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,900
I thought I lost them all.

668
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Are my passengers alright?

669
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,700
Yes, 110.

670
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,000
110. That's not good!

671
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's alright, what do you mean it's not good?

672
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,500
Don't worry, 110 is extraordinary!

673
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
How is Dureene?

674
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,000
Farly severe laceration, but we'll keep
handling her infection.

675
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm sure he'll be ok.

676
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Has a scar, and a hell of a story to tell.

677
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,500
If someone believes it, I'm seeing it right now,
and i can't believe it.

678
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
You landed a plane on the Hudson without a scratch...

679
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Erny...

680
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,800
The Union is pulling out all the big guns today...

681
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,600
You took a damn risk Sully.

682
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,600
Got a count.

683
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
155

684
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,600
155?

685
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,700
It's official.

686
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
Oh, 155.

687
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,300
Thank you Erny.

688
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Hey Carl!
Yes?

689
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,700
Sully.
Carl.

690
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
You didn't blown up today, did you?

691
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
We're here, that's all I know at the moment.

692
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,700
Oh This is Miss May, from the Hotel.

693
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Would like to have a quick word with you.

694
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,200
This won't take much time gentlemen, this only to say

695
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,200
that our staff is committed to protect your privacy.

696
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,200
If there's something you need, at all...

697
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,200


698
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,300
If it's possible, I'd like to have my uniform cleaned and ready.

699
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,100
Are you kidding?
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could!

700
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:52,500
Okay, well Thank you Ella.
Thank you very much.

701
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Well, anything for Sully!

702
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
What just happened?

703
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,800
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

704
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,100
Ah come on Sully!

705
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,700
When was the last time you heard someone
landing a jetplane on the water?

706
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,900
And finally lived?

707
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,300
Exactly.

708
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:22,100
I got shaving cream, razor blades, two pairs and some clothes.

709
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,100
Do you think we're ninjas?

710
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:30,000
It's seven o'clock in the evening.
You find the Merch Brothers!

711
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah.

712
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Sully.

713
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
What are you still doing in uniform?

714
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,100
Well, I don't know.

715
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,600
Look guys, it's been a long day.
Why don't you just get some rest?

716
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,600
Mike will be here later to make sure you ok!

717
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
Thank you Carl.

718
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,700
No, thank you Captain.

719
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,100
You know, it's been awhile since
New York had news so good.

720
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,100
Especially with airplanes.

721
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I'll see you later Sully.

722
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
The word's city officials keep repeating....

723
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,800
And of course the precise timing of the pilot

724
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,200
Captain Sully Sullenbenger, the man who had almost no time

725
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,800
Became a man for all time.

726
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Hey Sully, give me....

727
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,900
Come on, answer...

728
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,000
Larry, the CBR is in 2 days.
How fast can you interfere?

729
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Sully?

730
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,200
I know Airbus has simulations for A320 manifacturer,
but that's next week.

731
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,200
Can you get them to reschedule?

732
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,200
On 3 in the morning?

733
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,900
I need you to make it happen, before
we listen to the CBR.

734
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,900
Before the testimony is complete.

735
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,900
Why?

736
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,700
I have a right to see these simulation, and I have a feeling that with a human pilot

737
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
 and not a computer, the results would be different.

738
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,500
What if they show the exact same result?

739
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,100
If they do, I'll hang myself in.

740
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:53,500
It's everything about timing Larry.
You can accomplish anything in a hurry.

741
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
Sure as hell I agree with that.

742
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,100
Now the CBR is on Wednesday, that's 36 hours.
Can you make it happen?

743
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,100
I'll try.
I'll give a phone call.

744
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,500
It's already late, so you better get started.
Thank you Larry.

745
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Hey Lory

746
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,300
Hi. I'm sorry bothering you.

747
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,300
Sweetheart, what... What happened?

748
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:43,900
I just realized that there were 155 people on that plane,
and you were one of them

749
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,200
We almost lost you.

750
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,400
Yeah, but you didn't.
I'm right here.

751
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,300
How are you holding up?

752
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,500
Please tell me that this is almost over.

753
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,500
It's almost over.

754
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
Okay.

755
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
I love you.

756
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,600
I love you too

757
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
I'll call you when they're done with me.

758
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,900
Good Morning Sully.

759
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,900
Alright, Good Morning ladies and Gentlemen.
My name is Charles Porter

760
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,300
I've been assigned from the National Transportation Safety
in order to conduct this hearing today

761
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,100
We have a lot of material to cover.

762
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:07,900
But before we hear to the cockpit voice recording,
we will listen for the first time with you Gentlemen.

763
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:16,300
For the request of Captain Sullenberger and the Union,
AirBus has agreed to view pilot simulations.

764
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
Upload link, please.

765
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:23,200
Those simulations Sully, won't change my mind about
what happened up there.

766
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Birds!

767
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Number 1 is on rollback!

768
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,200
Auto-pilot's off.

769
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,200
Pilot off.

770
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
Flight director's off.

771
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,000
LaGuardia, due to engine failure, we have to return

772
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,600
Ok, I'm gonna turn left to LaGuardia on 3.

773
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,600
Activated the approach for you.

774
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
Activated.

775
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
Runway 13

776
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,200
Let's get down nicely.

777
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
*ALARM*
Too low.

778
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,900
Succesful landing at La Guardia.
Runway 13

779
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
For the record: The pilot's and the computer's simulations made the same result.

780
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,600
Second upload please, about the second run?

781
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Birds.

782
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Give me a heading in 3-1-0

783
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
Heading 3-1-0.

784
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
1 thousand.

785
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Flaps too

786
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Flaps too.

787
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
*ALARM* Too low

788
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Succesful landing, runway 19

789
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,800
Multiple airports, runways, two succesful landings

790
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,000
We are simply seeing what the computer already told us.

791
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,900
A lot of toes  were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

792
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,400
But frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen play the game by.

793
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,400
Can we get serious now?

794
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Captain?

795
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,300
We've all heard about the computer simulations and now
we were watching for actual simulations but

796
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
I can't quite believe.

797
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,800
You simply haven't taken into account human factor.

798
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,200
Human pilot simulations showed that
you could have made it back to the airport.

799
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,200
No, they don't.

800
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:26,200
These pilots were not behaving like human beings.
Like people who were experiencing this for the first time.

801
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,200
But they made up on reacting like you did.

802
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,100
Immediately after the bird strike
they were turning back to the airport.
Correct?

803
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,100
That is correct.

804
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,100
They knew where to turn,
and exactly knew where to fly.

805
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,100
They did not run a check,
they did not turn on the APU

806
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,900
There were all the same paremeters that you faced.

807
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,900
No one warned us.

808
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:51,600
No one said : You are going to lose both engines
at a lower altitude that any jet in the history.

809
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:58,500
But be cool, make just a left turn to La Guardia like
you're going back to pick up the milk.

810
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:10,800
This was a dual engine loss at 2800 feet
followed by immediate water landing. 155 souls on board,
no one ever trained for an incident like that.

811
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
No one!

812
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,800
In the TeterBoro landing, with that unrealistick back angle,
we were not to find birds up there.

813
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:24,500
I'd like to know how many times the pilots practiced that
maneuvre before actually put it off.

814
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,400
I'm not questioning the pilots, they're good pilots.

815
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,500
But they were clearly instructed to head back to the airport
immediately after the bird strike.

816
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,400
You would have no time to analyze this decision.

817
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,200
In these simulations you take
all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

818
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:49,200
How much time did the pilots had to prepare for this event,
for these simulations?

819
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
You were looking for human air.

820
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Then make it human.

821
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
This wasn't a videogame.

822
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,800
It was life and death.

823
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,300
Sully's right, that's worth a few seconds.

824
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,600
Please ask practicers how much they had.

825
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
17

826
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
17?

827
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:32,000
The pilot who landed at TeterBoro had 17 practice attempt, before the simulation we just witnessed.

828
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,800
Your reaction-decision time is 35 seconds.

829
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,300
35 seconds is not our time.

830
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:48,700
We only had 208 second total so....
I'll take it.

831
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,200
Upload link, return to La Guardia.

832
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,700
Now we added 35 seconds to response time.

833
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,900
Birds!

834
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,900
Gas off.

835
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
35 seconds.

836
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,200
Time's up.

837
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
Here we go.

838
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Going for 13.

839
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
We're right ahead for the airport.

840
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
*ALARM* Caution, obstacle

841
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
We're about 7 miles away.

842
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
*ALARM* Caution, obstacle

843
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
*ALARM* Terrain! Terrain!

844
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
*ALARM* Too low! Terrain!

845
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Let's try Teterboro.

846
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,200
Upload the link please.

847
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,400
Birds!

848
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
Flight Director off.

849
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
35 seconds.

850
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,500
Engine 1 and 2 fail.

851
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,700
Let's see if we can make it.

852
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,400
Way too low.

853
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
*ALARM* Obstacle! Obstacle!

854
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
Does anyone need to see any more simulations?

855
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,200
Now that we seen what could have happened,
can we listen at what we actually did?

856
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,300
We will look at other results in another date.

857
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,300
Elizabeth.

858
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:26,000
For the record, this is the CVR of the Flight 1549,
January 15th, 2009.

859
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Birds!

860
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
Shit!

861
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,600
We got one rolling back

862
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,200
We've got both of them rolling back.

863
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,800
Ignition start.

864
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,400
Get out the QRH.

865
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Lost both engines.

866
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,100
Mayday Mayday, we lost both engines,
we're turning to La Guardia.

867
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,100
Okay you need to turn to La Guardia?
Turn left at 220.

868
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,100
Which engine did you loose?

869
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Both, both engines.

870
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,400
Check those flight ignition.

871
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,400
Ignition?
Ignition.

872
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,400
Thrust lighters. Idle?
Idle.

873
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,600
Captain 1549, you want to try land on runway 13?

874
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,400
We are unable,
we're trying to land on the Hudson.

875
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:28,800
Emergency power. Emergency generators not online.
Not online.

876
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,900
Captain's 1549, it's gonna be runway 31.
Unable

877
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,900
Okay, where do you need to land?

878
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,800
You've got 10 seconds Captain. Talk to me.

879
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,900
Captain 1549, runway 4 is available.

880
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,900
I don't think we can make any runway.

881
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:11,100
Anything in New Jersey, maybe TeterBoro?

882
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,100
I'll be right side with TeterBoro Airport.

883
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,800
La Guardia Departure? Got an emergency inbound.

884
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,300
Captain 1549, he's going at the airport right now.

885
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,300
You got an emergency?

886
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,300
Yeah, bird strike, Can I get runway 1-1?

887
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,200
Captain 1549, wanna try with Teterboro?

888
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:47,100
*ALARM* Obstacle, obstacle.
Pull up!

889
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
*ALARM* Too low, terrain!

890
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,900
This is the Captain, brace for impact!

891
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,000
Captain 1549 turn right to 3-0.
You can land on 1-0!

892
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
We can't make it.

893
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,400
Go ahead and try number 1.

894
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
We're going to end up in the Hudson.

895
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,800
All right, let's put the flaps down,
flaps down.

896
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
Couple of flaps, want more?

897
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,500
No, it's good.

898
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,500
You got runway 2-9 at Newark,
it's gonna be 2 o'clock, 7 miles.

899
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,300
You got any ideas?

900
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,300
Actually not.

901
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I'd need to take a quick break.

902
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,400
What do they think?

903
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,800
Seeing what I just done?

904
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,700
I'll tell you what I think.

905
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,700
I'm just so damn proud.

906
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:07,000
You were right there,
With all those distractions.

907
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
We did this together like a team.

908
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,900
Thanks Sully.

909
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,900
We did our job.

910
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,500
Alright, we got to get this hearing back to order.

911
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
Could you settle please?

912
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,600
Take your seats.

913
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,200
That was honestly,
The first time I was listening to a crash recording.

914
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:08,400
While actually sitting with the Captain and First Officer.
It's extraordinary.

915
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,800
That was no simulation?

916
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,100
No it wasn't.

917
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:22,300
Gentlemen, I want to inform you that
the left engine was recovered.

918
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,800
I'll just proceed to a comprehensive report.

919
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:35,500
There was extensive damage to the fan blades of the engine,
5 compressor blades were fractured.

920
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,100
And 8 aerial veins missing.

921
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So no thrust.

922
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,800
As you testified, it was completely destroyed.

923
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,900
The Aircraft's data was wrong.

924
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,100
I'd like to add something to a personal note:

925
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:01,800
I can say with absolute confidence that,
After speaking with the rest of the crew

926
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:07,800
bird experts, aviation engineers,
After running into every scenario,

927
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:13,200
after running each player,
There were still accidents results..

928
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:21,800
And it's you, Captain Sullenberger, removing you from
the equation of math, just fails.

929
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,300
I disagree.

930
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,800
It wasn't just me, it was all of us.
Jeff, Donna, Shila and Dureene.

931
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,400
And all passengers, rescue workers.

932
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:42,000
And Traffic Control,
Helicopter Crews and Scuba Cops.

933
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,800
We all did it!

934
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,300
We survived.

935
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:56,900
First Officer Skiles,
Is there anything you'd like to add?

936
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:02,900
Anything you would have done different,
If you had to do it again?

937
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,400
Yes, I would have done it in July!

938
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:50,200
