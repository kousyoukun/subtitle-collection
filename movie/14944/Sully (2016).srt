2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,003
Flight 1549, Clear to take off.

3
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:14,408
Flight 1549, Ready to take off

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,153
Mayday, Mayday, Captain 1549,
We've lost both engines

5
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,440
Both engines!

6
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:42,046
No rely on motor 2

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,074
Captain 1549,, We can get
a view on runway 148

8
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:47,201
We can't make it, We're
turning back to La Guardia

9
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:08,082
La Guardia Tower, Flight 1549
We're going to try to make 13

10
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:10,109
Sully, We are too low

11
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:12,136
Sully, We are too low!

12
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,211
Come on!

13
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:25,506
It's set on fire!

14
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,352
Come on!

15
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:34,919
Sully

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,123
Lory I love you!

17
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:36,205
What the hell is the matter with you?

18
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:37,290
Everyone, EVERYONE survived on flight 1549!

19
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,322
You think you'll die, that's what you think

20
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:47,151
And then, miraculously you don't!

21
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:50,180
Thank you Captain, Thank you!

22
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,206
Thank you!

23
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,832
Thank you Captain Sullbenger
for being here today.

24
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,859
I would also welcome First Officer Skiles

25
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,886
Glad you made it at this point.

26
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,913
Not aswell as we are.

27
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:17,441
For the record, we have an
aircraft system investigation,

28
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,468
and also aircraft structures, MRT

29
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,497
Aircraft perfomance, ATCS, life factors,
survival factors

30
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:25,525
nd also emergency response
Today we begin

31
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:28,553
with our operations, human
performance and investigations.

32
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:30,580
On the crash of US Flight 1549

33
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,607
The water landing.

34
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:34,133
Captain?

35
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,160
This was not a crash,
it was a water landing.

36
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:38,186
We knew what we were trying to execute

37
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,916
It was not a crash, it was
a forced water landing.

38
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,643
Why didn't you attempt to return
to La Guardia?

39
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,772
There was simply not enough altitude

40
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:55,306
The Hudson was the only place long enough and
smooth enough and wide enough to attempt a landing.

41
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,835
Air traffic testified that you were
returning to La Guardia but you did not.

42
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:03,065
As I began the left turn,

43
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:07,295
I realized I couldn't make it back
and I would have eliminated other options

44
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,622
Returning to La Guardia
would have been a mistake.

45
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:12,150
Let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

46
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:14,176
There was no time for calculating.

47
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,707
I have relied on my experience on managing the altitude
and speed on thousand of flights over four decades.

48
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,733
You say you didn't calculated...

49
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:22,760
I attempted.

50
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:24,787
- You attempted.

51
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:26,814
Yes.

52
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:29,842
The best chance passengers had was on that.

53
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,870
And I bet my life on it.
In fact, I did!

54
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:35,298
And I would do it again.

55
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:39,327
Aviation engineers theorize you had
enough energy to get back to the runway.

56
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:43,958
Engineers are not pilots.
They're wrong.

57
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,086
And they weren't there.

58
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,116
Regardless, we have to follow all
implications as part of the investigation.

59
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,143
Our computers analized scenarios

60
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,671
run algorithms, write
simulations with the exact parameters.

61
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,700
The engine loss,
the altitude, everything you faced

62
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,526
when you made your decision.

63
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,054
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations

64
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,281
Not possible during the investigation.

65
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:08,308
You staid it was a dual engine failure

66
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,334
due to multiple blows with birds?

67
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:12,361
That would be unprecedented!

68
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:16,191
Everything is unprecedented, until
it happens for the first time.

69
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,259
How much sleep did you
get the night before?

70
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,286
Eight hours, enough.

71
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,012
It was possible that blood sugar was low?

72
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,441
I was rested, alerted, and
completely aware of my surroundings.

73
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,368
When was your last dring,
Captain Sullenbenger?

74
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,293
Nine days ago.

75
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:33,919
Droghe?

76
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,145
No, mai.

77
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,771
First Officer Skiles?

78
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,499
I don't drink, I never have.

79
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,526
Captain,

80
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,055
have you had any troubles at home lately?

81
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,083
Well, not more than anyone else.

82
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,110
And nothing that affected my work.

83
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,368
Bullshit.

84
00:06:57,392 --> 00:06:59,895
But why are they looking for
something we did wrong?

85
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,321
That turned out right.

86
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:04,350
It didn't turned out right for the
Airline and their insurance company.

87
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,577
We should expect some blowback.

88
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,802
Oh like what they can say?

89
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,441
That we shouldn't have saved everybody?

90
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,955
That's not personal.

91
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,982
The're just doing their job.

92
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,082
Relax, calm down.

93
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:16,110
Sully, they should give you a medal

94
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,738
and send you back to work.

95
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,843
Sorry, this mailbox is full.

96
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:23,068
I didn't called Lori this morning,
I'm guessing someone else did

97
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:27,398
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say:

98
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,725
It is an honor driving you today.

99
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,752
Thank you.

100
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:34,379
What new have said so far?
Two building went down,

101
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:38,409
Many millions without work, and
that's the first weeks of January.

102
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,836
But today's headlines:

103
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,863
This is beautiful!

104
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,996
Hey Mike, why don't we get the
driver as a character witness?

105
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,659
Finally.

106
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,685
Oh, finally.

107
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,712
The Airline has given us trapped all day.

108
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,241
It's just... I need to hear your voice.

109
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:12,268
I've heared everybody else's.

110
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,295
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.

111
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,822
It doesn't feel much like family.

112
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,039
It isn't quiet here too.

113
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,794
There are reporters asking for an update.

114
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:29,820
Inside the mind of Sully.

115
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,548
Lori, tell them you can't talk.

116
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,575
I cannot hear you, just call me later.

117
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,603
You don't have to talk with them.

118
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,630
Call me back.

119
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:57,635
Do you've got any news?

120
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:59,738
Have you achiedeved the impossible?

121
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:15,260
I think there's the press with a car.

122
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:18,188
Self-Defense, think the
juror would convinct?

123
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:20,215
Do what you have to do.

124
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,241
No, I'm asking for permission.

125
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,268
Cops will be coming after you.

126
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,082
Sully what are you doing?

127
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:33,225
Sully, are you listening to me?

128
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,251
We should talk later.

129
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,281
I've been reading all day.

130
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,708
Are you okay?

131
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,735
Yeah, I'm just tired, that's all.

132
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,762
How are the girls?

133
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,789
Oh good.

134
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:50,316
A bit overwhelmed, sounds like you are too.

135
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,136
Yeah, I'll be alright.

136
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,266
The whole world is talking about you.

137
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:08,898
Sully, I can't believe this.

138
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,925
Lori, I'll have to stay here,

139
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:14,754
Until the investigation is
over, Did I tell that already?

140
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,983
And I apologize if I
didn't told you already.

141
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:22,012
You don't need to apologize,
You're right where you need to be.

142
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:26,943
You know, I did the best I could.

143
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:29,972
Of course you did.

144
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,499
You saved everyone.

145
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,729
Maybe we should just talk in the morning.

146
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:38,756
I'm tired.

147
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,283
I'm overwhelmed by all these attentions.

148
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,816
I'm gonna be on TV next Morning,
what are they gonna ask me?

149
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,045
Sully do you want me to come be with you?

150
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:53,072
No Lori

151
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:55,098
The girls need you.

152
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,125
Tell them I love them.

153
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,853
I love you.

154
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:01,880
Get some sleep.

155
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:05,509
Yeah, maybe when I'll wake
up it'll be January 14th.

156
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,536
Wouldn't that be good?

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,563
I love you.

158
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:22,837
Why did Captain Sully made that faithful
decision to turn the Hudson into a runway?

159
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,864
Well, only he can answer.

160
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,891
But we now know, it was a wrong choice.

161
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:31,721
A choice that endangered the
lives of all of those on board.

162
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:35,050
So, while much of the
country hails him as a hero

163
00:11:35,374 --> 00:11:42,985
this new information will certainly change everyone's
understanding of the so called Miracle on the Hudson

164
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,817
Sully Sullenberger, are you a hero,
or a fraud?

165
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,502
Hello?

166
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,529
Jeff? Sorry for calling you so late.

167
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:13,556
It's ok, There's no sleep
in this room either.

168
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,785
Can you believe they charged
5 dollars for a Snickers?

169
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,715
I can take the Airline to
bankruptcy with four bites.

170
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,644
I thought you may wanna talk!
- Absolutely

171
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:30,575
Let's get some air.

172
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,103
Great

173
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,530
I will be there in 5 minutes.

174
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,465
Enjoying the shakes?

175
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,094
Nightmares? Little Heartbeat?

176
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:49,121
A little bit. The Union is
offering us Counseling.

177
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:53,551
Yeah, what would you say? You
were in a plane crash and lived.

178
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:56,179
It might have an impact in your day to day.

179
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,507
I don't like not being in
control of the process.

180
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,534
I won myself that

181
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:05,464
Within 6 months we'll laugh about
as we know David Letterman

182
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:10,194
We're doing David Letterman?

183
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,223
Yeah, right after next week's interview.

184
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:16,952
I'm guessing David's gonna
be excited for you.

185
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,079
This is so surreal.

186
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:23,509
I guess I'm having some problems in separating
reality from whatever the hell this is.

187
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,837
Yeah, this is two man
freezing their asses off

188
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,172
Sully,
Don't worry, you did a great day.

189
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,899
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

190
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,926
Here's a funny thing:

191
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,055
I've delivered over a million
passengers over 40 years in the air

192
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,984
But in the end I'lm gonna
be judged for 208 seconds

193
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:52,016
Come on, tomorrow it's gonna be a good day.

194
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,449
Computers will prove you're right,
and you'll put your wings back on

195
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,472
You wanna run?

196
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,499
Yeah, let's run.

197
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:04,129
Fucking cold out here.

198
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:07,859
This was obvious, it was
a critical situation

199
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,489
Losing both engines at a low altitude

200
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:16,519
Over one of the most populated
areas of the planet

201
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:22,251
But you chose to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big IF

202
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,978
I was sure I could do it

203
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,705
You were?

204
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:28,331
Yes.

205
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,960
How do you feel when
people call you a hero?

206
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:39,094
I don't feel like a hero.
I'm just a man who is doing his job.

207
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,922
The right man for the job
at the right time

208
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,753
You've been flying for what?
Nearly 40 years?

209
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:49,681
42, That's been my life

210
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:51,908
My whole life

211
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,448
Aircraft

212
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:06,075
Bomb-craft

213
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:25,094
I'll be busy son, so you
keep the plane clean please.

214
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,322
They are $ 6 per hour
Consider it a lesson time

215
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:34,555
Pilots never stop to acquire knwledge.
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.

216
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:39,486
Never forget, no matter what's happening,
to fly the airplane.

217
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,913
Absolutely, sir!

218
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,103
One other thing, and this is important!
Sir?

219
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:48,130
You can smile!

220
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,157
Alright!

221
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:02,726
I apologize for my sweating.

222
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,855
Oh no, After all you did I don't think
Katie could be more intimidating

223
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,385
Oh that wasn't Katie, It was the light
and the camera you brought in.

224
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,412
Ok, we're done.

225
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:16,041
That was from my mom.

226
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,969
Her name's Brenda, She told me to
say thank you and she's single!

227
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:24,200
Well, tell Brenda thank you,
but I got a girl at home.

228
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,227
Lucky woman

229
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,418
Sully, SULLY!

230
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,845
Sully, where are you?

231
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,872
I'm standing here calling your name.

232
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,899
What's up with you?

233
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:24,135
You need to get focused, because the media
requests Avalanche continues.

234
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,862
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:31,093
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in and
run Shotgun with you the rest of the way

236
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,120
Thought you might need a friend.

237
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:35,147
He will take you to NTSB now.

238
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:39,176
AirBus completed computer
simulations aswell

239
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,203
Good, Good, that will help!

240
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,230
There's something else

241
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:49,162
The Agency called,
The left engine was still operating

242
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:53,592
Not possible, I felt it go.
It was like it stopped in mid-air.

243
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,619
They said there's a chance it was sub-idle.

244
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:03,594
I'm just letting you know, since
the NTSB already does.

245
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,935
You've got to be kidding me.

246
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:38,567
Our job is to investigate.
Our plane ended up in the Hudson River.

247
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:46,834
Isn't it a little bit early for you
to go fishing?

248
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,262
Searching facts is not exactly
go fishing, Mr Skiles,

249
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:52,891
Let's see the most important fact: There
were only two people who know what happened

250
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,918
in the cockpit that day,
and I'm one of them.

251
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,145
And we appreciate your perspective.

252
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,172
Why are we here today?

253
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:03,101
Is it because Captain Sullenberger
did not return to La Guardia?

254
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:10,836
Look, I just finished training on the AR320, And I can
tell you the only reason the plane operated so well

255
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,667
Is because the Captain turned on
The auxiliary power unit on

256
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,693
He simply followed the QRH

257
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:21,022
No, no he wasn't. He wasn't
following proper procedure at all.

258
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:23,049
And I know because I had
the QRH in my hands.

259
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:29,982
He switched to APU immediately after engine blowback.
According to the Airbus that's the 15th thing to do.

260
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,613
If he followed the damn
rules, we would be dead.

261
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:40,345
Maybe that's the part you don't like.
You have answers to your guessing

262
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:47,479
Look, he's just saying that I held the
AR320 what it does and what it does to do

263
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:55,314
I held recountless CVR transcripts of deceased pilots and
I have significant accident investigation experience.

264
00:19:55,338 --> 00:20:01,847
There is no question that you're a talented,
dedicated, experienced professional.

265
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:10,783
Every crash investigated before are not object of this
investigation. Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

266
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:19,183
Your Union has been advised, The data relate that the
left engine continued setting himself on during flight.

267
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:21,210
Then the Data is wrong

268
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:26,641
The evidence showed that the engine was Idle or
Sub-Idle immediately following the bird strike.

269
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:30,270
You show me the left engine
I show you dead birds and no power

270
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:34,600
The left engine was lost in the crash,
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

271
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,627
We could circle back to that later,

272
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:41,057
Let's just assume, as you say,
a dual engine loss.

273
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:50,283
Your weight was 151.510 pounds, wind and temperature, nort,
north-west, 21 degrees, speed and altitude 200 nods and 2818 feet.

274
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:55,525
Correct.

275
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:03,549
The computer simulations of US Airways Flight 1549
showed that the Aviation Engineers were correct.

276
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:09,793
There was enough speed and altitude after the
bird strike for a succesful return to La Guardia

277
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,820
Succesful?

278
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:18,353
The plane landed at LaGuardia
intact, undamaged.

279
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,380
You got that from one computer simulation?

280
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,407
No, 20.

281
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:30,431
Including attempts made from LaGuardia runways. Every
Computer simulation with the exact flight parameters

282
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:39,078
demonstrated that return to LaGuardia was
possible. And not just possible, probable.

283
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:45,883
Does anyone here needs
further computer evidence?

284
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:50,113
Captain Sullenberger?

285
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:52,140
First Officer Skiles?

286
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:58,521
Not this time.
I would like to go over the parameters.

287
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:02,751
We'll make them available for the Union.

288
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:08,683
And once the Investigation is complete, we'll be
able to share the actual computer simulations

289
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:12,913
For now, they remain confidential.
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

290
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:16,141
There has been far too much
talk for the press already.

291
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:28,552
When the complete cockpit voice is compiled, alongside
with onboard transcripts we'll call you back.

292
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:32,092
Thank you gentlemen.
Good day.

293
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,821
Thank you.

294
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,988
We weren't playing Pac-Man, we were
flying a plane for human beings.

295
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:53,722
Some other, will have to remember it.
This just doesn't seem right

296
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:58,653
It's because this is not right You did
everything you could, that's more than enough.

297
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,682
Ask your passengers, Ask
your wife and kids. Ask Lori

298
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:30,148
So what's the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

299
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,175
Brace for impact

300
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:34,402
Now, ever heard of that before?

301
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,429
No, actually no

302
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,966
Ever heard of that in any
aspect of your life?

303
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,386
Take this show away from me.

304
00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:03,419
Jeff was relaxed and fine. He should
be getting over with other requests.

305
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,547
Are they paying you?
For all this media stuff at least?

306
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,076
No payment is necessary.

307
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,103
Oh, I wish the bank felt the same way

308
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:14,130
Why? What do you mean?

309
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,158
That's just....
We got another notice.

310
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:19,185
About the Space in View County.

311
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:25,017
Well, we'll find a tenant.
It just takes time.

312
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,345
You've been saying that for 9 months, Sully
It's still vacant

313
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,372
The economy has to take a turn.

314
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:34,702
It feels like, if we lose that space,
the next thing will be the house.

315
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:38,231
Lori, we're not gonna lose the house.

316
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:40,258
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:46,891
I'm sorry, I'm just anxious, and alone and
not enough sleep.

318
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:49,419
Yeah, I didn't get enough sleep either.

319
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:54,149
I'm sorry adding to your stress but,
Just tell me you'll be back soon.

320
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:58,079
Well not until the NTSB has finished
the investigation.

321
00:24:58,103 --> 00:25:00,106
We need you flying.

322
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:08,041
Lori, If this goes wrong, my career as safety expert,
will end, as the website and the business card.

323
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,668
I'm more worried about
your career as a pilot.

324
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,600
What if I did blow this?

325
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:18,627
What are you saying?

326
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,957
What if I did things
wrong, closing my career?

327
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:27,087
If I endangered the lives
of those passengers.

328
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,715
Sully, Watch the news!

329
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,942
You're a hero!

330
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,571
And everyone is going to get used to it,
Including the NTSB.

331
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:41,203
First case scenario:
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

332
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:44,131
That's immediate retirement, no pension.

333
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:46,158
My life is done.

334
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:48,685
Ok you're scaring me now, Sully.
What's going on?

335
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:53,015
The left engine might
have still been idle-ing.

336
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,847
And the AirBus Simulations said I could still
have made it back to La Guardia safely.

337
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,275
But it doesn't make sense.

338
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,204
That's in discussion with
everything I felt in the cockpit.

339
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,833
Then why did you do that Sully?

340
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:14,665
A land in the water? That's not the much
dangerous thing you could have done!

341
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:24,391
Good afternoon.

342
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,322
The Tuna Vasel or The Heaven Shatter.

343
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:31,348
Tuna Vasel, Very Fresh!

344
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,279
Thank you

345
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,508
Too cold today, too much cold!

346
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,135
When are you gonna come fly with me?

347
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,162
When U.S. Airways starts
to fly to Hidro-Bar.

348
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:48,192
I will talk, see if can work.

349
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,824
This is Thursday!

350
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:59,255
Suitcase is already stuffed
with gifts for Will.

351
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,085
Always fun to get things in the Airport.
Seems you travel too.

352
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:07,515
Mom, he's turning 1. Don't think he
can know what gift came from where.

353
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,541
But I will.

354
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,568
Maybe a Snow Globe.

355
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:15,798
Something he will remember.
Something from New York.

356
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,299
You forgot when we were kids?

357
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,928
Okay sweetheart, I'll get
you a Snow Globe too.

358
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,955
Fine. Come on.

359
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:35,798
Good afternoon.

360
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,825
Captain.

361
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,365
Hey guys, Jeff!
We're not gonna make it!

362
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:53,194
I believed in you for this trip,
Just meet us at the Gate ok?

363
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:58,926
Altimeters verified, 3023.

364
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,953
3023.

365
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,486
Checklist complete.

366
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:12,617
You really think there are recess?

367
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:16,747
Checking the latests reports, We could
make it all the way to Charlotte.

368
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:21,478
From steaks to Frisco, on me.

369
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,706
I've never been. And I hear good things

370
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,135
Oh, Rhubarb will break your heart.

371
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,463
Yeah, I'm more like Porker House man.

372
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,490
Porker House will stop your heart.

373
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,224
Wait, Wait Wait!

374
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:47,458
Hi, I'm sorry, Spirit sent us.
We cancelled and you said you have seats.

375
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:49,484
Flight is closed.

376
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:51,511
Wait, see that guy, looking up there?

377
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:54,043
That's my Dad, it's an emergency.
He's got to be on this flight.

378
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:56,066
Okay, everybody say the same.

379
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,593
Golf emergency.
Did it go cancelled?

380
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,022
IDs please.

381
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:04,950
How many travelling?
3.

382
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:08,379
Nothing together.
We'll find a way.

383
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:15,813
Here we go: 22A, 6A and 6C

384
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,840
Thank you so much!

385
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,864
Glad you made it!

386
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:32,953
You're on 6 Jeff. Oh no that's
Jimmy, I'm gonna get some sleep.

387
00:29:32,977 --> 00:29:36,382
Are you going to sleep here?
Not close to you.

388
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:38,409
Yo, yo, Goodnight!

389
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:43,039
Sorry, Excuse Me.

390
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,077
Yeah, of course.

391
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:59,630
I'm sorry, he likes to throw everything.
That's perfect, I like to catch everything.

392
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:07,465
I googled you last night.
Found you on the company's website.

393
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,995
That's impressive.
Thanks.

394
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:18,028
I thought I was a good bullshitter,
but you! You could go Pro!

395
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:26,652
Just kidding, but your site do not worry about
100 employees and headquarters in 3 states

396
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:32,796
When searching for more, I
realized that it was just you.

397
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,125
Now, go easy. I'm just getting it done.

398
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:39,654
I've never been acused being a bullshitter.

399
00:30:39,678 --> 00:30:42,181
Do not misunderstand!
It is a compliment.

400
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:44,508
Now, with that website, I know you!

401
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:50,341
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,
welcome on board US Airways Flight 1549.

402
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:58,365
Get sure to follow the safety instructions card on seatback in front of you,
explains safety features on thi aircraft, aswell as locations of emergency exits.

403
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:06,163
La Guardia, this is 1549,
ready for clearance

404
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:09,792
Ok 1549, 128 ready and protected.

405
00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:19,601
Get sure to turn that off.

406
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:41,031
Just once I'd like to go
to La Guardia in time.

407
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:45,361
Well you know hot to get to La Guardia.

408
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:47,388
No, what's that?

409
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:49,415
Fly at JFK.

410
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:01,560
Take-out fuel quality verified.

411
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:07,792
19000 Cargo aboard.

412
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:09,819
Captain's 1549, Runway
4, Clear to take-off.

413
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:13,548
Captain's 1549, Clear to take-off.

414
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,722
Positive rig

415
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,147
Nice view on the Hudson

416
00:33:05,072 --> 00:33:08,076
I can't get over on how
beautiful is up here.

417
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,103
Life's easier in the air.

418
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:12,130
I guess, it is.

419
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,158
BIRDS!

420
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:25,777
Oh shit!

421
00:33:38,194 --> 00:33:40,197
I'm worried, what's going on?

422
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:42,224
It's okay.

423
00:33:42,248 --> 00:33:45,252
It might be a good idea to
keep your seatbelts on.

424
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:50,010
We've got one rolling back.

425
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:53,415
We have both rolling back.

426
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:00,225
Ignition start.

427
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,841
Restarting APU.

428
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,088
Just double check your seatbelts please.

429
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:25,259
Seatbelts.

430
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:33,070
What do you think it was?
I think it was a bird strike.

431
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,097
We'll have to turn back to La Guardia.
Yeah.

432
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:37,725
Get out the QRH

433
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:39,752
We've lost both engines.

434
00:34:39,776 --> 00:34:41,778
Mayday, mayday this is
Captain 1549, we hit birds.

435
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:48,412
We've lost both engines, we're
turning back to La Guardia.

436
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,438
Ok, you need to return to La Guardia?

437
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:52,465
Turn left at 220.

438
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:54,492
Which engine did you lose?

439
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,519
Both, both engines.

440
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:58,546
Soup, I have an emergency.

441
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:01,874
What's the report?

442
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:04,903
Both engines, both engines gone.

443
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:11,636
LaGuardia says go to runway 13

444
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,168
Tower, stop your departures, we've got an
emergency returning. Flight 1549, bird strike.

445
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:19,194
We've lost both engines,
return immediately.

446
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,221
He lost both engines.

447
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:25,952
Captain 1549, if you can get a view,
do you want to try land on runway 13?

448
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,005
We are unable. We'll end up in the Hudson.

449
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:35,838
I've got an A320 diving in the river.
Al, stack the inbounds in La Guardia.

450
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:37,864
Let's put a load in the Tower please.

451
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:46,000
I need a runway, Captain 1549 needs
to get in an airport right now.

452
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:50,029
Newer Tower, what did you got?
Runway 29 ready. Need an emergency landing?

453
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:52,056
Yes, I'll be right side as Ftaburogh

454
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,990
Shit.

455
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:02,735
This is the Captain
Brace for impact.

456
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:07,766
What?
Brace, Brace, Brace

457
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,793
Heads down, stay down!

458
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:12,320
Brace, Brace, Brace

459
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,948
Heads down, stay down!

460
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:19,879
Captain 1549, turn right to 3-0.
You can land on run way 1 0 now.

461
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:21,906
That's negative, We're
landing in the Hudson.

462
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,932
I'm sorry, say again?

463
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:32,168
Captain 1549, radar contact lost.

464
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,195
IC, come on over here.

465
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:37,123
I've got also a newer copy
at 2 o'clock, about 7 miles.

466
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:51,963
Captain 1549, if you can, you got runway 29
available at 2 o'clock, 7 miles.

467
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:02,478
I'm sorry Patrick.

468
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:04,509
No, he's about to Newark,
he's just out of the box.

469
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:06,532
Hook'em back up.

470
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:09,460
We need authorized news.

471
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:12,788
Attention all aircraft in vicinity of JW,

472
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:25,210
We see the USS ship...
1549, low over the Hudson

473
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,236
I got eyes on him

474
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,865
Ok Hang on the chopper visuals.

475
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,293
He's out there.

476
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:38,023
He's heading to Newark, 7 miles.
Only 7 miles.

477
00:37:39,149 --> 00:37:44,456
Captain's 1549, this is Departure Control,
On Guard, do you read?

478
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:47,585
It's going down

479
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:50,144
Captain's 1549, do you read me?

480
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:54,474
Shit, it's going down!
It's gonna hit the water!

481
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:04,965
Testers are gonna come down.

482
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,992
Meet Eliza, it's the standard.

483
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:09,920
His voice was so calm!

484
00:38:11,045 --> 00:38:13,549
When he said the Hudson,
I wouldn't believe it!

485
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:17,178
This isn't happening.

486
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:20,907
We have took out survivors on
water landings, didn't we?

487
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,603
Embrace

488
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:44,920
I better go.

489
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:48,249
I am so sorry.
I love you.

490
00:38:48,273 --> 00:38:51,478
Yeah, I gotta go.

491
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,618
Choosing to land in the
Hudson was a big IF!

492
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:47,351
The evidence showed that a return to LaGuardia
was possible. The left engine was sub-idle

493
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,967
This is tasty 11
I have an emergency landing by breakdown

494
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:31,993
Roger that.

495
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:34,020
Looks like hydraulics.

496
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:36,047
Sir, we need to catch up.

497
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:38,074
Running a control test.

498
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:42,704
We need more altitude.

499
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:51,737
Tower, this is Tacy 11 with flight control

500
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:56,568
Roger that, turn left for 2-2-0

501
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,594
Unable

502
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:02,424
Okay, proceed straight for about 2 1

503
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:04,851
2 1, thanks a lot

504
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:07,979
2 1, Increasing speed

505
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,438
One, you look free to
fly, no trace of smoke

506
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:23,465
Roger that 2

507
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,492
I copied, I approach runway 21

508
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,519
Following you in

509
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,363
We're heading 0-2-0

510
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:41,390
Ok, you're free

511
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,724
Tasty 11, check your speed.

512
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,654
I repeat, maintain control.

513
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,680
Avoiding to stall.

514
00:41:56,206 --> 00:42:00,813
1, check your heading.
You're not going to make the runway!

515
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:02,840
I got it.

516
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,224
That was a hell of a landing sir!

517
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:25,251
Didn't think we were gonna make it!

518
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:57,572
I'm gonna start charging
for this stuff, alright?

519
00:42:57,596 --> 00:42:59,599
Hear me?

520
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:04,730
Hey, let me know if you need anything.

521
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:11,764
TV: What seems incredible is that
all passengers in the plane survived!

522
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,696
Hey, is that you?

523
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,026
Are you a pilot? Sully?
This is you, right?

524
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,455
It's a pleasure to meet you.

525
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:32,288
That was unreal what you did last day.
It's a real pleasure to meet you

526
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:36,919
We got a drink after you, as soon as
that happened. Ain't that right Manny?

527
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:44,943
Yeah yeah, you did! The Sully! A shot
of Grey Goose, with a splash of water.

528
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:55,893
To January 15th!

529
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,920
Best day in the year!

530
00:44:03,451 --> 00:44:07,858
Hey Pete, Sully's here, and he's there!

531
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:09,884
He's everywhere!

532
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:17,319
He's a real hero man!

533
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:28,398
Keep coming, let's see how they want!

534
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:38,436
No more people on board Cap,
that's what it takes for GW

535
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,463
Alright, thanks. Roger that.

536
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:44,192
We're heading into Midtown in Sub-7.

537
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,241
I cannot believe you had
to sat to say that.

538
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,976
I'd say it again, and with no question or hesitation.
It was the best picture in history of baseball.

539
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,505
Are you lying about the Lakers, is that
what it is? Or is it the mustache?

540
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:12,531
You're just jealous!

541
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:14,558
Jealous!?!

542
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:53,817
Brace, Brace!

543
00:45:53,841 --> 00:45:55,844
Heads down, stay down!

544
00:45:55,868 --> 00:45:57,871
It's ok.

545
00:45:57,895 --> 00:45:59,897
Stay down!

546
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:08,838
I don't wanna die!

547
00:47:02,312 --> 00:47:04,315
Evacuate!

548
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,147
Grab your life vests please

549
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,174
Opening door.

550
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:23,662
Confused screams....

551
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:33,500
Everyone, exits are usable. Move
forward to your closest exit!

552
00:47:48,777 --> 00:47:53,083
Move forward.
On the right there's an exit door.

553
00:48:09,405 --> 00:48:11,408
Sir, Evacuate the plane right now!

554
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:28,432
Calm down, you'll be fine!

555
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:40,449
Here, it's gonna be cold out there.

556
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:57,072
Jump!
Jump!

557
00:49:14,095 --> 00:49:16,098
Oh my god!

558
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,626
We have to jump..no no Wait!

559
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:31,920
Can you see this?
Yeah

560
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:33,947
Oh Christ, that's a plane.

561
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:46,129
Mayday Mayday, Channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson. We
have a passenger airliner in the north river!

562
00:49:46,264 --> 00:49:48,267
We're in route, we will advise!

563
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:50,294
Let's go, Let's go!

564
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:11,575
Jimmy, Jeff has not got out.
We can't leave him there!

565
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,602
We've got him, We've got him!

566
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:17,231
He will be okay!

567
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:29,801
Keep moving forward!

568
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:32,428
Follow the instructions!

569
00:50:40,764 --> 00:50:43,067
Sir, Sir! Can you come help us?

570
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,628
Everyone keep moving forward!

571
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:59,482
The plane's down, we got
passengers on the wings.

572
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:01,509
Approach with caution

573
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,989
Put a blanket on her legs

574
00:51:34,114 --> 00:51:36,117
You will be fine honey, go slowly

575
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:40,146
Wrap this around her leg, make it tight.

576
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,376
It's so cold out here.

577
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:52,716
Starting approaching, we're nearly there.

578
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:05,734
Pick it up.

579
00:52:05,758 --> 00:52:07,761
Alright

580
00:52:07,785 --> 00:52:14,695
3-2-1. It's good It's good!

581
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,556
Right there baby, Come on.

582
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:29,808
One at a time.
We'll get everybody!

583
00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:41,183
We're getting them on the other way.

584
00:52:57,806 --> 00:52:59,809
A little bit closer!

585
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,765
With a water temperature of 36
degrees and a windshield of -5

586
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:16,797
the survivors of flight 1549
literally have managed to live.

587
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:31,353
Get up here, there are other good
people coming right away, ok?

588
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:54,886
50 yards, GO!

589
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:12,510
I'll keep you like that ok?
Ok.

590
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:19,760
Someone is still here, Come back.
Help me!

591
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,947
Captain!

592
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:40,974
Captain, We have to go!

593
00:54:40,998 --> 00:54:43,001
Time to get off the plane, about now!

594
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,772
Alright let's go. GO!

595
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,799
I'll be right behind.

596
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:14,076
Sully, we got to go!

597
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:35,025
Everybody's okay?

598
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:53,840
All of them miraculously survived and they
found 300 New Yorkers ready to help them

599
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,882
The only question remaining
is: Will it be too late?

600
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:59,507
In Manhattan Bobby Cuza, New York One

601
00:55:59,531 --> 00:56:01,534
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on.

602
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:20,689
I was sure I was gonna die.

603
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:22,715
Hey, no one dies today, ok?

604
00:56:25,543 --> 00:56:27,546
Give me your hand

605
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:36,911
There you go Captain, this way!

606
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,938
Give me your hands sir!

607
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:51,479
We'll need more blankets over here!

608
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:53,506
Thank you, Thank you

609
00:56:58,437 --> 00:57:00,440
Yeah, we got them all!

610
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,772
Hello?

611
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:22,799
I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

612
00:57:22,823 --> 00:57:24,826
Oh good, are you still far away from home?

613
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:30,257
There's been an incident.
I'm okay, I just crashed somehow.

614
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,284
Turn on the television

615
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:34,311
What do you mean, turn on the television?

616
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:37,840
Lori I can't talk right now, I'll
call you when things calm down.

617
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:41,569
I had to land on the Hudson.

618
00:57:41,994 --> 00:57:44,798
Sully, I don't understand

619
00:57:44,822 --> 00:57:49,228
I love you and I'm ok,
tell the girls I'm ok!

620
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:52,356
I have to go!

621
00:57:54,082 --> 00:57:56,085
Girls turn on the TV

622
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:04,710
An extensive rescue after a US Airway
flight has crashed into the Hudson River.

623
00:58:05,346 --> 00:58:07,349
Oh my God.

624
00:58:28,867 --> 00:58:33,273
Take your wet clothes off and
wrap it up for the Red Cross.

625
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,689
You'll be okay.

626
00:58:55,304 --> 00:58:57,306
Jeff!

627
00:58:58,232 --> 00:59:00,234
Sully!

628
00:59:04,597 --> 00:59:08,602
I need a damage report, how
badly and I need it NOW!

629
00:59:08,626 --> 00:59:11,831
155. That's my number,
that's passengers included.

630
00:59:11,855 --> 00:59:13,857
Ok, How are you?

631
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:15,884
I'll answer that question
when you'll count 155.

632
00:59:15,908 --> 00:59:17,911
Alright,

633
00:59:20,238 --> 00:59:26,647
I'm alive. Shary, I can't
believe I'm talking to you.

634
00:59:33,357 --> 00:59:38,464
Captain, Captain I'm here to escort you
to Mayor Bloomber and Police Officers.

635
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:40,494
If the Mayor want to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

636
00:59:40,514 --> 00:59:42,517
Sully, I refused to send you with a cop!

637
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:46,947
Jeff! I need a count!
We've got to have a count!

638
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:48,974
There's no way to give you a count.

639
00:59:48,998 --> 00:59:52,203
Let's get you a drive before you freeze.

640
00:59:52,227 --> 00:59:54,534
Captain, the Mayor and Chief
McKelly, come down here to meet you.

641
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:56,857
I can't, because it was a domestic flight!

642
00:59:56,881 --> 01:00:01,087
Yeah, we have no doubts, but we have to track
the passengers informations down. One by one!

643
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,114
Ok, can we help?

644
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:05,141
Yeah, I'm gonna call and get you a count!

645
01:00:05,165 --> 01:00:07,568
Listen, you've done enough.
Let me take this for you!

646
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:20,021
Jeff!

647
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:23,650
I'm okay.
I was on the other wing.

648
01:00:23,674 --> 01:00:25,677
They brought us to Jersey!

649
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:28,105
I couldn't see you.
I couldn't find you!

650
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:30,131
I could hear you shouted my name all time.

651
01:00:30,156 --> 01:00:33,761
I shouted too, I don't know,
I guess the river....

652
01:00:33,785 --> 01:00:35,787
Are you okay?

653
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:38,615
I love you too.

654
01:00:39,841 --> 01:00:41,844
We made it!

655
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:45,974
The plane.... the plane's crashed!

656
01:00:45,998 --> 01:00:48,000
On the river!

657
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:50,027
Are you kidding me?

658
01:00:52,655 --> 01:00:55,559
Oh, that's unbelievable!

659
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:15,536
I've never been so happy to be
in New York in all my life!

660
01:01:27,515 --> 01:01:29,518
Hey Betty!

661
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,524
Ain't you coming?

662
01:01:33,548 --> 01:01:35,550
I guess he didn't hear.

663
01:01:35,574 --> 01:01:37,577
I lost Captain 1549 in the Hudson.

664
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:41,106
Yeah, I guess you had a hurry,
he hadn't, the son of a bitch!

665
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,133
Everyone's been pulled off!

666
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,160
It's a miracle!

667
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:48,088
I thought I lost them all.

668
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:53,151
Are my passengers alright?

669
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,880
Yes, 110.

670
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:02,212
110. That's not good!

671
01:02:02,236 --> 01:02:04,238
It's alright, what do
you mean it's not good?

672
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:08,769
Don't worry, 110 is extraordinary!

673
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,795
How is Dureene?

674
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:14,224
Farly severe laceration, but we'll keep
handling her infection.

675
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:16,251
I'm sure he'll be ok.

676
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,278
Has a scar, and a hell of a story to tell.

677
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:21,707
If someone believes it, I'm seeing it
right now, and i can't believe it.

678
01:02:21,731 --> 01:02:23,737
You landed a plane on the
Hudson without a scratch...

679
01:02:23,757 --> 01:02:25,760
Erny...

680
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,088
The Union is pulling out
all the big guns today...

681
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:31,817
You took a damn risk Sully.

682
01:02:31,841 --> 01:02:33,844
Got a count.

683
01:02:33,868 --> 01:02:35,870
155

684
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:39,900
155?

685
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:41,927
It's official.

686
01:02:47,547 --> 01:02:49,549
Oh, 155.

687
01:02:49,573 --> 01:02:51,576
Thank you Erny.

688
01:03:23,957 --> 01:03:25,960
Hey Carl!
Yes?

689
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:27,987
Sully.
Carl.

690
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:30,014
You didn't blown up today, did you?

691
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:32,040
We're here, that's all
I know at the moment.

692
01:03:32,064 --> 01:03:34,067
Oh This is Miss May, from the Hotel.

693
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:36,094
Would like to have a quick word with you.

694
01:03:36,118 --> 01:03:38,521
This won't take much time
gentlemen, this only to say

695
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:40,552
that our staff is committed
to protect your privacy.

696
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:42,575
If there's something you need, at all...

697
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:48,632
If it's possible, I'd like to have
my uniform cleaned and ready.

698
01:03:50,358 --> 01:03:55,465
Are you kidding?
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could!

699
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:02,899
Okay, well Thank you Ella.
Thank you very much.

700
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,926
Well, anything for Sully!

701
01:04:07,153 --> 01:04:09,156
What just happened?

702
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,183
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

703
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:14,434
Ah come on Sully!

704
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:19,142
When was the last time you heard someone
landing a jetplane on the water?

705
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:21,269
And finally lived?

706
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:24,698
Exactly.

707
01:04:24,722 --> 01:04:32,533
I got shaving cream, razor blades,
two pairs and some clothes.

708
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:34,559
Do you think we're ninjas?

709
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:40,391
It's seven o'clock in the evening.
You find the Merch Brothers!

710
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,418
Yeah.

711
01:04:42,442 --> 01:04:44,445
Sully.

712
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,472
What are you still doing in uniform?

713
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:48,499
Well, I don't know.

714
01:04:48,523 --> 01:04:52,028
Look guys, it's been a long day.
Why don't you just get some rest?

715
01:04:52,052 --> 01:04:56,057
Mike will be here later
to make sure you ok!

716
01:04:56,081 --> 01:04:58,084
Thank you Carl.

717
01:04:58,108 --> 01:05:00,111
No, thank you Captain.

718
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:02,538
You know, it's been awhile since
New York had news so good.

719
01:05:02,562 --> 01:05:04,565
Especially with airplanes.

720
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:16,434
I'll see you later Sully.

721
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:41,869
The word's city officials
keep repeating....

722
01:05:47,717 --> 01:05:52,324
And of course the precise
timing of the pilot

723
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,752
Captain Sully Sullenbenger, the
man who had almost no time

724
01:05:55,776 --> 01:05:59,381
Became a man for all time.

725
01:06:13,713 --> 01:06:15,716
Hey Sully, give me....

726
01:06:21,925 --> 01:06:24,428
Come on, answer...

727
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:30,537
Larry, the CBR is in 2 days.
How fast can you interfere?

728
01:06:30,561 --> 01:06:32,563
Sully?

729
01:06:32,587 --> 01:06:36,793
I know Airbus has simulations for A320
manifacturer, but that's next week.

730
01:06:36,817 --> 01:06:38,820
Can you get them to reschedule?

731
01:06:38,844 --> 01:06:40,847
On 3 in the morning?

732
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,475
I need you to make it happen, before
we listen to the CBR.

733
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,501
Before the testimony is complete.

734
01:06:45,525 --> 01:06:47,528
Why?

735
01:06:47,552 --> 01:06:51,358
I have a right to see these simulation, and
I have a feeling that with a human pilot

736
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,388
and not a computer, the
results would be different.

737
01:06:53,408 --> 01:06:56,112
What if they show the exact same result?

738
01:06:57,238 --> 01:06:59,741
If they do, I'll hang myself in.

739
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:04,171
It's everything about timing Larry.
You can accomplish anything in a hurry.

740
01:07:04,195 --> 01:07:06,198
Sure as hell I agree with that.

741
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,727
Now the CBR is on Wednesday, that's
36 hours. Can you make it happen?

742
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:11,754
I'll try.
I'll give a phone call.

743
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,184
It's already late, so you better
get started. Thank you Larry.

744
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:38,711
Hey Lory

745
01:07:38,735 --> 01:07:40,939
Hi. I'm sorry bothering you.

746
01:07:40,963 --> 01:07:42,965
Sweetheart, what... What happened?

747
01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:50,989
I just realized that there were 155 people
on that plane, and you were one of them

748
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:57,934
We almost lost you.

749
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:02,064
Yeah, but you didn't.
I'm right here.

750
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:04,992
How are you holding up?

751
01:08:06,218 --> 01:08:09,222
Please tell me that this is almost over.

752
01:08:09,246 --> 01:08:11,249
It's almost over.

753
01:08:11,273 --> 01:08:13,276
Okay.

754
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,302
I love you.

755
01:08:15,326 --> 01:08:17,329
I love you too

756
01:08:17,353 --> 01:08:19,356
I'll call you when they're done with me.

757
01:08:59,664 --> 01:09:01,667
Good Morning Sully.

758
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:04,695
Alright, Good Morning ladies and Gentlemen.
My name is Charles Porter

759
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,125
I've been assigned from the National Transportation
Safety in order to conduct this hearing today

760
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:11,953
We have a lot of material to cover.

761
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:18,686
But before we hear to the cockpit voice recording, we
will listen for the first time with you Gentlemen.

762
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:26,711
For the request of Captain Sullenberger and the
Union, AirBus has agreed to view pilot simulations.

763
01:09:27,146 --> 01:09:29,149
Upload link, please.

764
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:34,080
Those simulations Sully, won't change
my mind about what happened up there.

765
01:09:46,008 --> 01:09:48,011
Birds!

766
01:09:48,035 --> 01:09:50,038
Number 1 is on rollback!

767
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:52,065
Auto-pilot's off.

768
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:53,778
Pilot off.

769
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:55,782
Flight director's off.

770
01:09:56,503 --> 01:09:59,908
LaGuardia, due to engine
failure, we have to return

771
01:09:59,932 --> 01:10:02,435
Ok, I'm gonna turn left to LaGuardia on 3.

772
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,462
Activated the approach for you.

773
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:06,489
Activated.

774
01:10:06,513 --> 01:10:08,516
Runway 13

775
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:12,045
Let's get down nicely.

776
01:10:21,257 --> 01:10:23,260
*ALARM* Too low.

777
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:40,785
Succesful landing at La Guardia.
Runway 13

778
01:10:40,885 --> 01:10:46,893
For the record: The pilot's and the
computer's simulations made the same result.

779
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:52,525
Second upload please, about the second run?

780
01:10:57,908 --> 01:10:59,911
Birds.

781
01:11:03,216 --> 01:11:05,219
Give me a heading in 3-1-0

782
01:11:05,243 --> 01:11:07,245
Heading 3-1-0.

783
01:11:17,936 --> 01:11:19,938
1 thousand.

784
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:21,942
Flaps too

785
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:23,969
Flaps too.

786
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,432
*ALARM* Too low

787
01:11:43,372 --> 01:11:45,374
Succesful landing, runway 19

788
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:53,826
Multiple airports, runways,
two succesful landings

789
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:58,056
We are simply seeing what the
computer already told us.

790
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,986
A lot of toes were stepped on in
order to set this up for today.

791
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:07,417
But frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen play the game by.

792
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:09,444
Can we get serious now?

793
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,273
Captain?

794
01:12:13,297 --> 01:12:18,404
We've all heard about the computer simulations and
now we were watching for actual simulations but

795
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:20,431
I can't quite believe.

796
01:12:20,455 --> 01:12:25,863
You simply haven't taken
into account human factor.

797
01:12:25,887 --> 01:12:29,292
Human pilot simulations showed that you
could have made it back to the airport.

798
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:31,318
No, they don't.

799
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:37,251
These pilots were not behaving like human beings. Like
people who were experiencing this for the first time.

800
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:39,277
But they made up on reacting like you did.

801
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:44,208
Immediately after the bird strike they
were turning back to the airport. Correct?

802
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:46,235
That is correct.

803
01:12:46,259 --> 01:12:49,163
They knew where to turn, and
exactly knew where to fly.

804
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:51,348
They did not run a check,
they did not turn on the APU

805
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:54,018
There were all the same
paremeters that you faced.

806
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:56,045
No one warned us.

807
01:12:56,069 --> 01:13:02,778
No one said: You are going to lose both engines
at a lower altitude that any jet in the history.

808
01:13:02,802 --> 01:13:09,612
But be cool, make just a left turn to La Guardia
like you're going back to pick up the milk.

809
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:17,636
This was a dual engine loss at 2800 feet followed by immediate water
landing. 155 souls on board, no one ever trained for an incident like that.

810
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:23,980
No one!

811
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:30,012
In the TeterBoro landing, with that unrealistick
back angle, we were not to find birds up there.

812
01:13:30,036 --> 01:13:35,644
I'd like to know how many times the pilots practiced
that maneuvre before actually put it off.

813
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:39,533
I'm not questioning the
pilots, they're good pilots.

814
01:13:39,774 --> 01:13:45,682
But they were clearly instructed to head back to
the airport immediately after the bird strike.

815
01:13:45,706 --> 01:13:49,611
You would have no time to
analyze this decision.

816
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:53,441
In these simulations you take all
of the humanity out of the cockpit.

817
01:13:53,465 --> 01:14:00,374
How much time did the pilots had to prepare
for this event, for these simulations?

818
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,170
You were looking for human air.

819
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:08,233
Then make it human.

820
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:16,024
This wasn't a videogame.

821
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:18,051
It was life and death.

822
01:14:18,075 --> 01:14:20,578
Sully's right, that's worth a few seconds.

823
01:14:20,602 --> 01:14:23,807
Please ask practicers how much they had.

824
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:25,834
17

825
01:14:32,206 --> 01:14:34,209
17?

826
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:42,233
The pilot who landed at TeterBoro had 17 practice
attempt, before the simulation we just witnessed.

827
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:51,113
Your reaction-decision time is 35 seconds.

828
01:14:51,633 --> 01:14:54,538
35 seconds is not our time.

829
01:14:54,562 --> 01:14:59,969
We only had 208 second total so....
I'll take it.

830
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:03,498
Upload link, return to La Guardia.

831
01:15:03,522 --> 01:15:07,027
Now we added 35 seconds to response time.

832
01:15:11,221 --> 01:15:13,223
Birds!

833
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:15,250
Gas off.

834
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:17,277
35 seconds.

835
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,479
Time's up.

836
01:15:24,503 --> 01:15:26,506
Here we go.

837
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:36,296
Going for 13.

838
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,707
We're right ahead for the airport.

839
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:56,323
*ALARM* Caution, obstacle

840
01:15:56,347 --> 01:15:58,350
We're about 7 miles away.

841
01:15:58,374 --> 01:16:00,377
*ALARM* Caution, obstacle

842
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:04,535
*ALARM* Terrain! Terrain!

843
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,593
*ALARM* Too low! Terrain!

844
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:50,899
Let's try Teterboro.

845
01:16:51,124 --> 01:16:53,627
Upload the link please.

846
01:16:57,889 --> 01:16:59,892
Birds!

847
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,919
Flight Director off.

848
01:17:01,943 --> 01:17:03,945
35 seconds.

849
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:06,974
Engine 1 and 2 fail.

850
01:17:17,196 --> 01:17:19,199
Let's see if we can make it.

851
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,858
Way too low.

852
01:17:34,284 --> 01:17:36,286
*ALARM* Obstacle! Obstacle!

853
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,895
Does anyone need to see
any more simulations?

854
01:18:18,521 --> 01:18:22,727
Now that we seen what could have happened,
can we listen at what we actually did?

855
01:18:23,252 --> 01:18:26,857
We will look at other
results in another date.

856
01:18:26,881 --> 01:18:28,884
Elizabeth.

857
01:18:28,908 --> 01:18:36,908
For the record, this is the CVR of
the Flight 1549, January 15th, 2009.

858
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:09,592
Birds!

859
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:18,845
Shit!

860
01:19:21,248 --> 01:19:23,251
We got one rolling back

861
01:19:24,076 --> 01:19:26,880
We've got both of them rolling back.

862
01:19:31,503 --> 01:19:33,505
Ignition start.

863
01:19:50,048 --> 01:19:52,051
Get out the QRH.

864
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:54,078
Lost both engines.

865
01:19:54,102 --> 01:19:59,810
Mayday Mayday, we lost both engines,
we're turning to La Guardia.

866
01:19:59,834 --> 01:20:02,838
Okay you need to turn to La Guardia?
Turn left at 220.

867
01:20:02,862 --> 01:20:04,865
Which engine did you loose?

868
01:20:04,889 --> 01:20:06,892
Both, both engines.

869
01:20:16,085 --> 01:20:18,087
Check those flight ignition.

870
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:20,114
Ignition?
Ignition.

871
01:20:20,138 --> 01:20:22,141
Thrust lighters. Idle?
Idle.

872
01:20:30,324 --> 01:20:32,327
Captain 1549, you want to
try land on runway 13?

873
01:20:33,052 --> 01:20:36,157
We are unable, we're trying
to land on the Hudson.

874
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:40,587
Emergency power. Emergency
generators not online. Not online.

875
01:20:46,928 --> 01:20:51,634
Captain's 1549, it's gonna be runway 31.
Unable

876
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:53,661
Okay, where do you need to land?

877
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,563
You've got 10 seconds Captain. Talk to me.

878
01:21:12,587 --> 01:21:17,694
Captain 1549, runway 4 is available.

879
01:21:17,718 --> 01:21:19,721
I don't think we can make any runway.

880
01:21:19,745 --> 01:21:22,950
Anything in New Jersey, maybe TeterBoro?

881
01:21:22,974 --> 01:21:24,976
I'll be right side with TeterBoro Airport.

882
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,605
La Guardia Departure? Got
an emergency inbound.

883
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:34,137
Captain 1549, he's going
at the airport right now.

884
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:36,164
You got an emergency?

885
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,191
Yeah, bird strike, Can I get runway 1-1?

886
01:21:43,606 --> 01:21:47,011
Captain 1549, wanna try with Teterboro?

887
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:55,035
*ALARM* Obstacle, obstacle.
Pull up!

888
01:22:06,638 --> 01:22:08,641
*ALARM* Too low, terrain!

889
01:22:19,096 --> 01:22:23,802
This is the Captain, brace for impact!

890
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,885
Captain 1549 turn right to 3-0.
You can land on 1-0!

891
01:22:39,909 --> 01:22:41,911
We can't make it.

892
01:22:44,371 --> 01:22:46,374
Go ahead and try number 1.

893
01:22:47,499 --> 01:22:49,502
We're going to end up in the Hudson.

894
01:23:06,722 --> 01:23:08,725
All right, let's put the
flaps down, flaps down.

895
01:23:30,195 --> 01:23:32,197
Couple of flaps, want more?

896
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:33,523
No, it's good.

897
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:36,080
You got runway 2-9 at Newark,
it's gonna be 2 o'clock, 7 miles.

898
01:23:36,263 --> 01:23:38,266
You got any ideas?

899
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,293
Actually not.

900
01:24:44,057 --> 01:24:46,060
I'd need to take a quick break.

901
01:25:01,482 --> 01:25:03,484
What do they think?

902
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:06,913
Seeing what I just done?

903
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,843
I'll tell you what I think.

904
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:15,821
I'm just so damn proud.

905
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:19,150
You were right there, with
all those distractions.

906
01:25:24,113 --> 01:25:26,116
We did this together like a team.

907
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:29,044
Thanks Sully.

908
01:25:29,068 --> 01:25:31,071
We did our job.

909
01:25:53,354 --> 01:25:55,657
Alright, we got to get this
hearing back to order.

910
01:25:55,681 --> 01:25:57,684
Could you settle please?

911
01:25:58,409 --> 01:26:00,812
Take your seats.

912
01:26:08,174 --> 01:26:12,380
That was honestly, the first time I
was listening to a crash recording.

913
01:26:12,404 --> 01:26:20,404
While actually sitting with the Captain
and First Officer. It's extraordinary.

914
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:24,044
That was no simulation?

915
01:26:24,869 --> 01:26:27,373
No it wasn't.

916
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:34,571
Gentlemen, I want to inform you that
the left engine was recovered.

917
01:26:34,595 --> 01:26:38,100
I'll just proceed to a
comprehensive report.

918
01:26:39,025 --> 01:26:47,025
There was extensive damage to the fan blades of
the engine, 5 compressor blades were fractured.

919
01:26:47,829 --> 01:26:51,334
And 8 aerial veins missing.

920
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:54,294
So no thrust.

921
01:26:54,318 --> 01:26:58,124
As you testified, it was
completely destroyed.

922
01:26:58,148 --> 01:27:00,151
The Aircraft's data was wrong.

923
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:08,438
I'd like to add something
to a personal note:

924
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:14,070
I can say with absolute confidence that,
after speaking with the rest of the crew

925
01:27:14,094 --> 01:27:20,102
bird experts, aviation engineers,
after running into every scenario,

926
01:27:20,126 --> 01:27:25,534
after running each player, there
were still accidents results..

927
01:27:25,558 --> 01:27:33,558
And it's you, Captain Sullenberger, removing
you from the equation of math, just fails.

928
01:27:34,895 --> 01:27:37,599
I disagree.

929
01:27:39,341 --> 01:27:45,149
It wasn't just me, it was all of us.
Jeff, Donna, Shila and Dureene.

930
01:27:45,173 --> 01:27:49,780
And all passengers, rescue workers.

931
01:27:49,804 --> 01:27:54,410
And Traffic Control, Helicopter
Crews and Scuba Cops.

932
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,139
We all did it!

933
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:00,667
We survived.

934
01:28:04,436 --> 01:28:09,243
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

935
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:15,275
Anything you would have done
different, if you had to do it again?

936
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,805
Yes, I would have done it in July!

937
01:28:46,595 --> 01:28:54,595
