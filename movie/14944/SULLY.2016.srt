1
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:06,017
全美航空1549，跑道4，可以起飞
Cactus fifteen forty-nine, runway four, clear for take off.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,090
全美航空1549，可以起飞
Cactus fifteen forty-nine, clear for take off.

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,052
“SOS”，全美航空1549，双发停车，是双发
"Mayday, mayday", Cactus fifteen forty-nine, we loss both engines, both engines.

4
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,080
1发和2发重新启动失败
No relight on one and two.

5
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:39,080
全美航空1549，如果我们能给你清空跑道13，你能尝试降落吗？
Cactus fifteen forty-nine, if we can get it to you, you wanna try to land runway one three?

6
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:42,085
离场管制，我们没法办到，我们现在返回拉瓜迪亚机场
Departure control, we can't make it, we turning back towords LaGuardia.

7
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:02,050
拉瓜迪亚塔台，全美航空1549想降落在跑道13
LaGuardia tower, Cactus fifteen forty-nine, try to make one three.

8
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,007
萨利，我们太低了
Sully, we are too low.

9
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,027
萨利，我们太低了
Sully, we are too low.

10
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:07,040
稳住
Come on.

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,000
就快到了
Almost here.

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,080
加把劲
Come on.

13
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:29,097
萨利
Sully.

14
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,037
罗琳，我爱你
Lorraine, I love you.

15
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,007
萨利机长

16
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,007
听译：danassus

17
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,085
你有什么毛病啊？
What the hell is matter with you?

18
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:20,010
机上乘客150人，加上3名空乘人员和2位驾驶员
The onboard count 150 passengers, 3 fligt attendants, and 2 pilots.

19
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,012
其中一位是高级驾驶员
One of them is senior pilot...

20
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:23,032
...用他的经验和技术...
...through all of his experience and skill...

21
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,082
加上奇迹般的好运
which combine with near miraculous good luck...

22
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:27,095
结局简直是让人惊叹
out of result was frankly astounding.

23
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,045
部分受伤乘客并无生命危险
There were some non-critical injuries...

24
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:31,095
可每个人，每个人都幸免于难
but everyone, everyone survive.

25
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:35,035
全美航空1549号航班的首张画面...
The first picture of US Airways flight fifteen forty-nine...

26
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:38,025
你以为自己要死了，绝望了
You think you gonna die, that's what you think,

27
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,067
可奇迹般的又捡回条命
and then miraculously you don't.

28
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,022
谢谢你，机长
Thank you, Captain.

29
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,035
谢谢你，谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

30
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,067
好了，谢谢大家的到来，谢谢
OK, thank you everybody, thank you.

31
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,095
感谢机长萨伦伯格今天能来
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger been here today.

32
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,040
我也要欢迎副驾驶斯基尔斯
Also I wanna welcome first office Skiles.

33
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,017
谢谢你今天能赶来
Glad you make it in this morning.

34
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,065
我们才是最开心能来的吧？
Not as glad as we're?

35
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:12,035
首先说明，我们有飞机系统小组参与这起调查
For the record, we have aircraft system team in this investigation.

36
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,087
还有飞机结构，维护检修
Also aircraft structure MRT.

37
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,095
飞机性能，空中交通管制
Aircrat peformance ATC.

38
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:19,002
野生动物因素，存活因素，应急响应
Wildlife factor, survival factor and emergency response.

39
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,090
今天我们先着手进行个体表现的调查
Today we begin with our operation in human peformance investigation.

40
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:25,042
涉及全美航空1549号航班的坠机事故
On the crash of US Airways flight fifteen forty-nine.

41
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,020
- 水上迫降   - 机长你说什么？
- Water landing.   - Captain?

42
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,040
这不是坠机，是水上迫降
This was not a crash, was a ditching.

43
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:32,090
我们清楚自己在做什么
We knew what we were trying to execute here.

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,065
这不是坠机，是水上迫降
It's not a crash, it's a forced water landing.

45
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,080
你为什么不尝试返回拉瓜迪亚机场
Why didn't you attempt to return to LaGuardia?

46
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:42,062
显然没有足够的高度
There simply was not enough altitude.

47
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:46,047
只有哈德逊河足够长，足够平
The Hudson was only place was long enough, smooth enough...

48
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,080
和足够宽，尝试在上面安全着陆也绝非易事
and wide enough to even attempt to land aircraft safely.

49
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:50,007
空管证实
Air traffic testified that

50
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,087
你曾说要返回拉瓜迪亚机场，可并未执行
You stated you were returning to LaGuardia, but you did not.

51
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:57,050
在我开始左转后
As I began the left turn,

52
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,007
我意识到这是不可能办到的
I realised I couldn't make it back.

53
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,002
并且也会断了各种后路
Then it would eliminate all the other options.

54
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:04,012
返回拉瓜迪亚是错误的选择
We turning to LaGuardia would be a mistake.

55
00:05:04,035 --> 00:05:06,037
好吧，给我们讲讲你是怎么计算那些参数的
OK, let's get to how you calculate all those parameters.

56
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,087
根本没有时间去计算
There was no time for calculating.

57
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:11,030
我不得不依赖自己这四十多年来
I had to rely on my experience of managing the altitude

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,075
从上千次飞行中积累下来的，对高度和速度的掌控经验
and speed of thousands of flights over 4 decades.

59
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,025
这么说你没有做任何的...
You're saying you didn't do any...

60
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,037
我目测了一下
My eyeball did it.

61
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,080
你目测？
You eyeball did it?

62
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,070
那条河是机上乘客生还的最大希望
The best chance those passenger had was on that river.

63
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,055
我决定豪赌一把
And I bet my life on it.

64
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,057
事实就是这样
In fact I did it.

65
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,037
我还会再赌一次
And I would do it again.

66
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,010
根据航空工程师的推算，你有足够的动力抵达跑道
Aviation engineers theorising you had energy make it back to runway.

67
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,047
工程师不等于飞行员
Well, engineers are not pilot.

68
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,097
他们搞错了
They're wrong.

69
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,010
而且他们也不在现场
And they won't there.

70
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:45,032
先不管了，考虑各种可能性是我们调查的需要
Regardless, we have to follow up all implications as part of our investigation.

71
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:48,042
我们的计算机会返回场景算法
Our computers would return senario algorithm

72
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:51,015
这样就能用和你们相同的参数生成模拟
so it will generate simulation with your exact parameters.

73
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:53,015
双发停转，高度
Two engine loss, the altitude.

74
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,025
你做出抉择时所面对的一切
Everything you face when you make decision.

75
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:57,095
我想旁观这些计算机模拟
I would like to see those computer simulations.

76
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,080
调查期间可安排不了
Not possible during investigation.

77
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:02,062
你说因遭飞鸟多次撞击
You stated there's two engine failure...

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,075
造成双发停车？
due to multiple bird strikes?

79
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,075
这是前所未有的情况
That would be unprecedented.

80
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,082
凡事皆有头一回嘛
Well, everything is unprecedented untill it happens for the first time.

81
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,042
你头天晚上睡了几个小时?
How much sleep did you get the night before?

82
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:17,097
8小时的好觉
Eight hours, enough.

83
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,082
你的血糖有可能偏低吗？
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

84
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:22,077
我精神饱满，思维敏锐，对周围环境了如指掌
I was rested, alerted, and completely aware my surroundings.

85
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,020
你上一次饮酒是什么时候？机长萨伦伯格
When was your last drink, Captain Sullenberger?

86
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,027
9天前
Nine days ago.

87
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,017
有滥用药物吗？
Drugs?

88
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,022
没，从没有过
No, I never.

89
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:30,022
副驾驶斯基尔斯？
First office Skiles?

90
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:33,010
不喝酒，一直如此
Don't drink, never have.

91
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:39,012
机长，你家里最近有什么烦心事吗？
Captain, have you had any trouble at home lately?

92
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,042
家家都有本难念的经
Well, no more than anyone else.

93
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,077
这从不会影响到我工作
And nothing affected my work.

94
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:50,090
真是荒唐
It's bull shit.

95
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,090
他们为什么想找我们的过错？
Why are they looking for something we did wrong?

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,007
结果不是皆大欢喜吗
When it turned out right.

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,087
航空公司和他们的保险公司可欢喜不起来
It didn't turned out right for the airline and their insurance company.

98
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,075
对此我们要有些心理准备
We should expect some blowback.

99
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,040
不是吧，他们还能有什么理？
Come on, what they gonna say?

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,007
你不该去挽救大家？
that you shouldn't save evertbody?

101
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,027
这不是针对我们
It's not personal.

102
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,050
国家运输安全委员会只是照章办事
NTSB just doing its job.

103
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:08,045
一旦他们收集到完整的证据，自会消停的
Once they have all the facts, it'll calm down.

104
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,025
萨利，他们应该给我奖章
Sully. They should pin down the medal,

105
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,085
送我回去工作
send me back to work.

106
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,020
抱歉，邮箱已经满了
Sorry, this mailbox is full.

107
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:17,090
今早到现在，我没再给罗琳打电话，好像其他人都打了
I didn't call Lorraine since this morning, apparently everyone else did.

108
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:21,049
不是有意打扰你们，不过我很想说一句Not meaning to bother, but I have to say.

109
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:23,035
能给你开车真是荣幸
It is a honor driving you today.

110
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,007
谢谢
Thank you.

111
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,022
今年都是些什么破事啊
What has been this year so far.

112
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:29,055
2场战争还打不完
# Mudoff, two wars without end.

113
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:31,047
几百万人找不到工作
Many million new people with no work.

114
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,010
这还只是1月份的头2周
That's just first two week January.

115
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,062
可看看这周五的头条？
Friday's headline?

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,025
太鼓舞人心了
This is beautiful.

117
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:43,020
嘿，麦克，我们让这个司机去做人品证人怎么样
Hey, Mike, how about we have driver as character witness.

118
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,040
终于打来了
Finally.

119
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,065
是啊
Yeah, finally.

120
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,085
国家运输安全委员会耗了我们一天
The NTSB has us tied up all day.

121
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,005
明白，我只是...
Yeah, I just...

122
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,042
我只想听下你的声音
I need to hear your voice.

123
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,092
听别人的都听烦了
been hearing everybody else's.

124
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,015
现在你的侄子多到吓死你
You would be amazed how many cousin you have now.

125
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,037
我们家没这么多吧
It doesn't feel much like family.

126
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:18,030
我这里也不清静
They aren't quiet here too.

127
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:22,000
记者想让我分享下
The reporters would want me to give a update...

128
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,080
你现在的心境，我该跟他们说点什么？
inside the mind of Sully. what should I tell them？

129
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:26,077
罗琳，告诉他们你没法透露什么...
Lorraine, tell them you're not allowed to talk about...

130
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,045
我没法...
Look, I can't...

131
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,050
我听不清你说什么，亲爱的，真的
I can't hear you, sweet heart, really, I can't hear...

132
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:30,057
- 过会儿打给我  - 罗琳,我想说...
- Just call me back.   - Lorraine,I try to tell you...

133
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,067
你不需要开口...
Do not have to talk about...

134
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:33,032
我听不清，过会儿再打给我...
Call, I can't hear you, call me back.

135
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,055
萨利，机长萨利
Sully, Captain Sully.

136
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,012
你是怎么完成这个壮举的？
How did you pull off the impossible？

137
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:55,005
- 萨利  - 萨利
- Sully.  - Sully.

138
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,085
请让下
Pardon me.

139
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:10,030
我打算开车撞走这些媒体
I'm thinking about running over the press with the car.

140
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,062
正当防卫，你觉得陪审团会定我的罪吗？
Self defense, you think jury will convict?

141
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,031
你自己看着办
Do what you have to do.

142
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,090
我就当你同意了啊，警察到时会来抓你
I'm taking that as the permission, cop would be coming after you.

143
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,030
我还真没见过这种场面
I haven't seen anything like this.

144
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,092
他们把整条街堵得水泄不通
They're blocking the entire street.

145
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:23,022
周围邻居都很生气
and the neighbours are furious.

146
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,080
抱歉，可这太过分了
I'm sorry, but serious.

147
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,037
萨利，你有在听我说吗？
Sully, are you listening to me?

148
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,022
要不我们晚点再谈
Maybe we should talk later.

149
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,015
亲爱的，就是现在了
Honey, it is later.

150
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,005
我等了一整天
I, I've been waiting all day.

151
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:35,017
你没事吧？
Are you OK?

152
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,002
我没事，就是有点累，没别的了
I, yes, I just tired, that's all.

153
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:38,095
女儿都还好吧?
How are the girls?

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,090
她们有点不知所措，好像你也有点
They're a little overwhelmed, sounds like you're too.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,032
嗯，我会没事的
Yeah, I'll be all right.

156
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:50,022
我会没事的
I'll be all right.

157
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:52,027
嗯，就是
Yes, it is.

158
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:55,025
找到丢失的发动机是调查人员的当务之急
...the missing engines will definitely are what investigators wanted...

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,007
你现在家喻户晓了
The whole world is talking about you.

160
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,055
老公大人
My Sully.

161
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,057
我有点，我不敢相信这是真的
I just, I can't believe that.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,085
罗琳，我得在这多呆几天
Lorraine, I have to stay here longer...

163
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,037
配合国家运输安全委员会的调查
for the NTSB investigation.

164
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:09,011
我先前跟你说了吗？
Did I tell you that already?

165
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,002
没的话，我向你道歉
I apologize if I didn't tell you.

166
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,037
没有什么需要你道歉的
There is no need for you to apologize.

167
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,070
你就在需要你的地方
You're right where you need to be.

168
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,027
我希望你明白，我做了该做的一切
I want you to know I did the best I could.

169
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:24,045
那还用说
Of course you did.

170
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,025
你救了大家
You saved everyone.

171
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,072
要不我们明天在说吧
Maybe we should just talk in the morning.

172
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,002
我累了
I'm tired.

173
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,090
成了万众瞩目的对象，让我有点无所适从
I'm overwhelmed by all these attention.

174
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:40,094
我明天要上电视了
I'm gonna on TV in the morning.

175
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:42,057
他们会问我什么问题，我该如何应答？
What they're gonna ask me, what I'm gonna say?

176
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,040
萨利，你要我过去陪你吗？
Sully, would you want me to come here with you?

177
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,065
不，不用，罗琳
No, no, Lorraine.

178
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:49,020
谢了，可女儿需要你
Thanks, but the girls need you.

179
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,072
替我向她们问好
Tell them I love them.

180
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,037
我爱你，睡个好觉
I love you, get some sleep.

181
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
嘿，也许我一觉醒来，会是1月14号
Hey, maybe when I wake up, it will be January 14.

182
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,027
那样多好啊？
Would that be good?

183
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,047
机长萨伦伯格为什么要做出那个重大决定
Why Captain Sullenberger made that fateful decision...

184
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:15,057
把哈德逊河变为跑道？
to turn the Hudson into a runway?

185
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:18,002
只有他能回答了
Well, only he could answer.

186
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:21,072
可我们现在知道那是错误的决定
But we now know it was wrong choice.

187
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:26,007
是危及机上所有人性命的决定
The choice endanger the lives all of them onboard.

188
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:29,082
几乎整个国家都尊他为英雄
So much of the country hail him as a hero.

189
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:34,020
新出炉的信息将肯定改变大众对于
This new information will certainly change everyone's understanding...

190
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:37,042
“哈德逊奇迹”的见解
of so call miracle on the Hudson.

191
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,082
“萨利”萨伦伯格，你是个英雄，还是个骗子？
'Sully' Sullenberger, are you a hero, or a fraud?

192
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:03,087
- 喂？  - 杰夫？
- Hello?  - Jeff?

193
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,065
抱歉这么晚还打给你
Sorry call you so late.

194
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,080
没事，我在这边也睡不着
It's OK, there is no sleep in this room either.

195
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,015
这里的一块士力架要买5块钱，你敢相信？
Can you believe they charge 5 dollars for a Snickers?

196
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,075
我要多咬几口，航空公司怕是得破产
I could bankrupt the airline in about four bites.

197
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,055
就是看你想不想...
Just thought maybe you would want to...

198
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,017
肯定的
Absolutely.

199
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,017
出去透透气?
Let's get some air?

200
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,040
好极了
Great.

201
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,052
5分钟后见
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

202
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,022
你还享受颤抖啊？
You enjoying the shakes?

203
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,042
噩梦，或者心跳过快呢？
The nightmares, rising heartbeat?

204
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,080
有一点，工会建议我们接受心理咨询
A little bit, Union offers us counseling.

205
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,027
对，他们会怎么说?
Yeah, what they're gonna say?

206
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:47,050
你的飞机坠毁了，你还活着
Your plane crashed, you live.

207
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,002
这可能会留下点后遗症
It may have minor impact on you day to day.

208
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:53,012
我讨厌失控的感觉
I don't like not been in control of the process.

209
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,082
我想恢复本色
I want myself back.

210
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,077
我只希望6个月后
I'm hoping 6 months from now on,

211
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,082
我们能调侃自己上大卫·莱特曼晚间秀的事
We will be just laughing about how we get to meet David Letterman.

212
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,062
我们要上大卫·莱特曼晚间秀？
We're doing David Letterman?

213
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:07,037
对，就在下一个国家运输安全委员会的问询后
Yeah, right after the next NTSB interview.

214
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,025
大卫·莱特曼
David Letterman

215
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:10,070
我猜大卫会多讲几个笑话的
I'm guessing David gonna be slightly funnier.

216
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,082
真是做梦一样
It's so surreal.

217
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,090
我猜自己快有点
I'm guessing I'm having little trouble...

218
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,050
分不清现实和这一摊子乌七八糟的事了
seperating reality from whatever the hell this is.

219
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:21,020
这里面有太多人的奉献了
This is two many freezing their ass off.

220
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,032
别担心，你做的事很了不起
Don't worry, you did a great thing.

221
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,097
会被载入史册的
It's gonna be remembered for a very long time.

222
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:32,017
可滑稽的是
Here's the funny thing.

223
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:36,037
我40年来运送了上百万的乘客
I delivered a million passengers over forty years in the air.

224
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:40,025
可到最后，208秒就给我盖棺定论了
But in the end, I'm gonna be judged on 208 seconds.

225
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:45,067
别这样，明天会更好的
Come on, tommorrow gonna be a good day.

226
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:49,092
计算机模拟会证明你是对的，我们都会重返驾驶舱的
Computer sim will prove you're right, we all gonna put our wing back on.

227
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,027
你想跑会儿步吗？
You wanna run?

228
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,055
好，一起跑会儿吧
Yeah, let's run.

229
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,050
真是冻死个人了
Fucking cold out here.

230
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,037
显然，情况十分危急
It obvious, was a critical situation.

231
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:06,052
在低空失去双发动力
Losing thrust in both engines at low altitude.

232
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:10,077
底下就是地球上人口最密集的地区之一
Over one of most density populated area of the planet.

233
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:13,072
可选择在哈德逊河上着陆
But choosing to land on Hudson.

234
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:16,007
仍然是个大大的问号
That was still the big if.

235
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,097
我确信自己能成功
I was sure I could do it.

236
00:14:19,062 --> 00:14:20,052
你确信？
You were?

237
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,012
听到别人喊你英雄，是什么感觉？
How do you feel when people call you a hero?

238
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,000
我不觉得自己像英雄
I don't feel like a hero.

239
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:32,077
和别人一样，我只是做好本职工作而已
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

240
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,085
恰当的人，在恰当的时机力挽狂澜
The right man for the job at the right time.

241
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,057
你飞行了有将近40年了？
You been flying for what, nealy 40 years?

242
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,052
42年，干了一辈子
42, that's been my life.

243
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,002
我的整个人生
My whole life.

244
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,050
你来操纵
Your aircraft.

245
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,095
我来操纵
My aircraft.

246
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,047
余下的夏天，我都要忙着开飞机喷洒农药
I'll be busy crop dusting in #supercut rest of the summer

247
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,075
所以，你想什么时候飞都行
So, you can take the plane up when you please.

248
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,072
还是6元一小时，就当作是训练课
Still 6 bucks an hour, consider a lesson time.

249
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,020
飞行员要热爱学习
Pilot never stop acquiring knowledge.

250
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,042
你总会犯错，人之常情
You'll make mistake, everyone does.

251
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,065
汲取教训就是了
Just learn from it.

252
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,045
懂了
Yes.

253
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,065
要切记的是，不管遇到什么状况
Never forget no matter what's happen out there...

254
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,042
操纵好飞机
Fly the airplane.

255
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:35,067
完全明白，教官
Absolutely sir.

256
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:40,040
还有一件事，挺重要的
Oh, one other thing, this is important.

257
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,030
教官？
Sir?

258
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,055
要笑口常开
You go ahead and smile.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,017
好的
All right.

260
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:55,090
抱歉我出了不少汗
I apologize for the perspiration.

261
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,025
不用，你完成了那样的壮举
No, no, after what you did,

262
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,065
我相信凯蒂不会咄咄逼人的
I don't think Katie could be too intimidating.

263
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,080
我不是怕凯蒂
Oh,  it wasn't Katie.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,007
是因为她带来的这些灯光和摄像机
It was the lights and cameras that she brought with.

265
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,005
好了，化妆完毕
OK, we're done.

266
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,070
这一下是替我妈
That, that was for my mom.

267
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:13,032
她叫布兰达，她让我跟你说声谢谢，还有...
Her name is Branda, she said she said thank you, and...

268
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,080
她是单身
She's single.

269
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,085
跟布兰达说声谢谢，可我家里有媳妇等着呢
Well, tell Branda thank you, but I've got a girl at home.

270
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:19,042
她真幸运
Lucky one.

271
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,005
谢谢
Thank you.

272
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,027
萨利
Sully.

273
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:00,090
萨利，萨利！
Sully, Sully!

274
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,067
我站在这叫你都不答应
I'm standing here calling you name.

275
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,005
你到底怎么了？
What's up with you？

276
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,052
你得专注起来
You need to get focused.

277
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,035
媒体邀约可是源源不断在涌来啊
Because the media request avalanche continues.

278
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,030
好，好的
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:25,010
拉里·鲁尼自告奋勇要来给你保驾护航
Larry Rooney volunteer to jump in to ride shotgun with you the rest of the way.

280
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,025
想你可能需要个朋友
Thought you might need a friend.

281
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:29,070
他会接你去今天的国家运输安全委员会的会议
He'll take you to today's NTSB meeting.

282
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:33,007
空客也完成了他们的计算机模拟
Airbus complete their computer simulations as well.

283
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,020
好，很好，那是好事
Good, good, that'll help.

284
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:36,017
另外还有
There is something else.

285
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,072
阿尼·金泰尔打了电话
Arnie Gentile called

286
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:40,050
他要了飞行数据记录器的记录
He asked ADR's data.

287
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:43,010
显示左翼发动机维持在空转状态
The left engine was still operating at idle.

288
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:46,005
不可能，我感觉它停了
Not possible, I felt it go.

289
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,017
我们就像在半空中停住了一样
Looks like we stopped in mid air.

290
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:50,040
阿尼说也有可能是在次空转
Ernie said there's a chance it's sub-idle.

291
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,050
这样的话就仍有推力
That it still could has thrust.

292
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:56,040
我只是让你有个准备，因为国家运输安全委员会也已得知了
I'm just letting you know since the NTSB already does.

293
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,017
萨利，到这边来
Sully, come over here.

294
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,067
嘿，拉里，真高兴能见到个熟人
Hey, Larry, good to see a familiar face.

295
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,017
你今天也就只能见到这一张了
That's the last one you see today.

296
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,007
你不是开玩笑吧，你早就知道了？
You got to be kidding me, you knew all this before?

297
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,037
我并无意想惹恼你
I'm sorry if you're frustrated

298
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:31,097
可我们的工作就是去调查飞机掉进哈德逊河的原因
But our job is to investigate how plane ended up in Hudson river.

299
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,090
是浮在哈德逊河上
On Hudson clearly.

300
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,060
今年这个时候去“钓鱼”是不是早了点？
Isn't it a little early in the year to go fishing?

301
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,066
寻求事实跟“钓鱼”完全是两码事，斯基尔斯先生
Seeking the fact is hardly fishing, Mr. Skiles.

302
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,051
那好吧，我告诉你个最重要的事实
OK then, here is the most important fact.

303
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:47,092
当天只有两个人知道驾驶舱内发生的情况
There are only two people who know what happened in the cockpit that day.

304
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,055
我就是其中之一
I'm one of them.

305
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:50,020
我们感谢你分享自己的见解
And we appreciate your perspective.

306
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,000
你可知道我们今天来的原因？
Why do you even think we're here today?

307
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,047
是因为机长萨伦伯格没有返回拉瓜迪亚机场
It's because Captain Sullenberger did not head back to LaGuardia.

308
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,090
我才刚完成A320的训练
Look, I just finish training on the A320.

309
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,007
我可以向你们担保，飞机能在我们的操纵下成功迫降
And I can tell you the only reason the plane operated as well as it did.

310
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:06,037
能有地点选择降落的唯一原因
The aircraft could land anywhere

311
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:09,027
是因为机长萨伦伯格打开了辅助动力装置
is because Captain Sullenberger turn on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

312
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:11,052
他不过是执行快速检查单的要求而已
He's simply follow the QRH.

313
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,015
不，不是，他并没这样
No, no, he wasn't.

314
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,007
他根本没有走正常程序
He wasn't following proper procedure at all.

315
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,020
我当时就拿着快速检查单，所以我知道
I know because I had QRH on my hands.

316
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,095
发动机刚减速，他就打开了辅助动力装置
He switch on the APU immediately after engines roll back.

317
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,087
而根据空客的手册，那排在检查单的第十五位
According to Airbus, that's 15th thing on the list to do.

318
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:25,030
第十五位
15th.

319
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,032
他要是执行那破单子，我们早完蛋了
If he follow the damn rules, we all be dead.

320
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,045
或许你们不爽的就是这点？
Maybe that's the part you don't like?

321
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:34,070
不习惯别人点醒你们
Not used to have an answer to your guesses.

322
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:37,030
听我说，我们...
Look, look, we just...

323
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:41,080
想说的是我深知A320的长处和短板
saying that I know A320 what it does and what it doesn't do.

324
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,030
我读过无数牺牲机长的驾驶舱通话录音副本
I have read countless CVR transcripts of deceased pilots.

325
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:49,027
也有相当多的事故调查经验
and I have significant accidents investigation experience.

326
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:50,082
没人质疑这点...
There is no question...

327
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,052
你是个天资卓越、爱岗敬业和经验丰富的专业人才
that you're a talented, dedicated, experienced professional.

328
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:58,040
1月15号前你飞过的所有航班
All the flights you pilot before January 15,

329
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,092
之前与你有关的任何事故，都与这起调查无关
Every crash you're investigated. They're not the purview of this investigation.

330
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:04,055
今天我们只关心全美航空1549
Only US Airways fifteen forty-nine matters today.

331
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,092
你们的工会已被告知
Your Union has been advised.

332
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,087
飞行数据记录器传出的信号显示
ADR's data relay that

333
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:13,020
左翼发动机在整个飞行期间一直在转动
the left engine continue to turn throughout the flight.

334
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,092
那飞行数据记录器搞错了
Then ADR's data is wrong.

335
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:20,032
记录显示在鸟击过后，左翼发动机立即进入空转或次空转状态
The evidence show the left engine were idle or sub-idle immediate follow the bird strike.

336
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:21,072
你把左翼发动机找来
You show me the left engine.

337
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:24,000
我就给你看死鸟和停车的痕迹
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,015
左翼发动机在坠机过程中
The left engine was lost in the crash...

339
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,042
因水面撞击而丢失
due to excessive damage on touch down.

340
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,062
不过我们可以以后再研究
But we can circle back to that later.

341
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,077
我们就先假定你说的是事实
Let's just assume that it was as you said...

342
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:36,030
因鸟击造成双发停车
a dual engine loss due to birds strike.

343
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:39,047
你飞机的重量是68.7吨
Your weight was 151,510 pounds,

344
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:42,050
风向和温度分别是西北偏北和零下6度
wind and temperature, north northwest and 21 degree,

345
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:46,090
速度和高度分别是370公里/小时和859米
speed, altitude, 200 knots and 2,818 feet.

346
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:48,037
- 对吗？  - 对
- Agree?  - Correct.

347
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,030
我们用了各种算法都得出一致结论
We are able to run all the algorithms concur...

348
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:55,032
全美航空1549次航班的计算机模拟结果
and resulting computer simulations of US Airways flight 1549,

349
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:58,002
显示航空工程师是对的
show the aviation engineers were correct.

350
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:00,042
在鸟击过后，飞机有足够的
There're enough altitude and speed...

351
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:03,080
高度和速度成功返回拉瓜迪亚机场
after birds strike for a successful return to LaGuardia.

352
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,077
成功返回？
Successful?

353
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:08,025
飞机降落在拉瓜迪亚机场
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

354
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,070
完好无缺
Intact.

355
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:11,072
未有损坏
Undamaged.

356
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:14,002
这是一个计算机模拟给的结果？
You got that from one computer simulation?

357
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:15,012
不是
No.

358
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:20,032
包括一次尝试降落在泰特伯勒机场的跑道19
Including a attempt to Teterboro runway one nine.

359
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:23,010
拉瓜迪亚的跑道22和跑道13
in LaGuardia runway two two and one three.

360
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:27,057
每个计算机模拟都使用同样的飞行参数
Every computer simulation with exact flight parameters...

361
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:30,077
证明返回拉瓜迪亚机场是可能的
demonstrate that return to LaGuardia was possible.

362
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:33,002
而且不只是可能，是可行的
And not just possible, probable.

363
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:40,005
有谁还想听更多的计算机模拟结果？
Is there anyone need to hear further computer evidence?

364
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:44,012
机长萨伦伯格?
Captain Sullenberger?

365
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,080
副驾驶斯基尔斯？
First office Skiles?

366
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:48,050
不了，这次就算了
No, not this time.

367
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,047
我想再核实下计算机模拟用的参数
I would like to go over the parameters we used.

368
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:56,052
我们会给工会提供的
We will make them available at the Union.

369
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:57,032
谢谢
Thank you.

370
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,047
调查一旦完成
And once the investigation is complete.

371
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,048
我们将公开具体的计算机模拟数据
We'll be able to share the actual computer simulation.

372
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,055
目前数据暂时保密
For now they remain confidential.

373
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,067
我们还不能向媒体披露
We can not afford to leak to the press.

374
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:10,032
这件事受到的关注实在是太大了
There are far too much talk about this already.

375
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,065
等完整的驾驶舱通话记录导出
When the complete cockpit voice recording is compiled...

376
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,095
以及机上的空管通讯副本完成
along with ATC of onboard transcript combined.

377
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,072
我们再通知你们
We'll call you back.

378
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,015
谢谢各位，再见
Thank you gentlemen, good day.

379
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:40,087
他们像是在玩“吃豆人”，而你是给大活人开飞机啊
They're playing PACMAN, you're flying a plane for human beings.

380
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:43,035
这是怎么一回事
What's matter of this...

381
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:45,012
跟我的记忆完全对不上
That's not how I remember it.

382
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:47,085
有点不对劲啊
It just doesn't seem right.

383
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,090
因为就是不对
Because it's not right.

384
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:52,040
萨利，你使出了浑身解数，要求不能再高了
Sully, you did everything you could, it's more than enough.

385
00:22:53,032 --> 00:22:54,030
去问问乘客
Ask the passengers.

386
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,050
问问你的妻子和孩子，问问我的家人
Ask your wife and kids, ask mine.

387
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:23,085
那你从驾驶舱听到的第一句话是什么?
So what was the first thing you heard from cockpit.

388
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:26,050
- 准备紧急撞击姿势，就是这句  - 准备紧急撞击姿势
- Brace for impact, yes.  - Brace for impact.

389
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,045
以前从驾驶舱里听到过吗？
Ever heard that before from the cockpit?

390
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:30,052
没，从没有过
No, not ever.

391
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,092
那你平常生活中有听到过吗？
Now, ever heard that in any other aspect of your life?

392
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:41,077
我不是故意的
I don't know.

393
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,040
我不是故意的
I don't know.

394
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,057
你让我失态了
You take the show away from me.

395
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,077
杰夫很放松，应对自如
Jeff was relax, and did fine.

396
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,000
接下来的采访都会交给他了
He should getting all of our interview request.

397
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,035
他们有给你报酬吗？
Are they paying you?

398
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:00,015
至少上媒体这种应该有吧？
For all this media stuff at least？

399
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,045
新闻节目，罗琳
It's news, Lorraine.

400
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,027
是没有报酬拿的
No payment is necessary.

401
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,045
要是银行也这么想就好了
Wish bank feel the same way.

402
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,072
为什么，你这是什么意思？
Why, what do you mean?

403
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,015
就是...
It just...

404
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,067
我们又收到催款通知了
We got another notice.

405
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,010
是布尤特县的那块空地
About this space in Butte County.

406
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,055
我们会找到租户的，就是需要时间
Well, we'll find a tenant, it just takes time.

407
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,062
是啊，这句话你都说了8个月了
Yeah, you've been saying that for night months.

408
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,090
萨利，可它还是空着
Sully, it's still vacant.

409
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,052
经济肯定会回暖的
The economy has to take turn.

410
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:26,012
可是，如果我们失去那块地
It just, it feels like if we lose that space.

411
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,035
马上就会牵连到我们的房子
The next domino falls to the house.

412
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,095
罗琳，我们不会失去房子的
Lorraine, we're not gonna lose the house.

413
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:33,000
对不起
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,025
对不起，我有点...
I'm sorry, I just...

415
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,075
我有点烦躁
I'm anxious and...

416
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,067
我独自一人，而且...
I'm alone... and...

417
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,010
睡眠不足
not enough sleep.

418
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:43,012
嗯，我明白，我在这里也睡不好觉
Yeah, I know, not have a lot of sleep around here either.

419
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,060
对不起，我又让你更焦虑了吧
I'm sorry if I'm adding to your stress.

420
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:47,067
你很快就能返回纽约工作吗
But just tell me you would be back to New York soon.

421
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,075
那要等到国家运输安全委员会完成他们的调查了
Not untill the NTSB finish their investigation.

422
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,072
我们家需要你工作
We need you fly.

423
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:56,097
罗琳，如果情况急转直下，我作为
Lorraine, if this goes badly, my career...

424
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:58,095
安全专家的事业
as a safety expert...

425
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:01,085
会连同网站和生意一同消失
will end as the website and the business card.

426
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,020
我更关心的是你机长的事业
I'm more worrying about your career as a pilot.

427
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:10,017
如果我这次真搞砸了
What if I did blow this.

428
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,000
你说什么？
What are you saying？

429
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,080
如果我这次真弄错了，晚节不保？
If I did get this wrong, so close to the end of my career?

430
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,072
如果我真危及了机上全体乘客的性命？
If I endanger the lives of all those passengers?

431
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:24,042
萨利，看看新闻
Sully, watch the news.

432
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:25,087
你成了英雄
You're a hero.

433
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:29,040
每个人都要对此习以为常，包括国家运输安全委员会
And everyone's gonna have to get used to it, including the NTSB.

434
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,070
最糟的情形
Worst case scenario.

435
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:35,012
国家运输安全委员会有合理根据定我的罪
NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

436
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:37,072
那就是立即退休，退休金更别想了
That's imediate retirement, no pension.

437
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,097
我一生的事业付之一炬
My life work gone.

438
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,075
好吧，你吓到我了，萨利，到底怎么回事？
OK, you're scaring me now, Sully what is going on?

439
00:25:44,017 --> 00:25:46,057
左翼发动机有可能一直在空转
The left engine might have still been idling.

440
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,015
而且空客的模拟显示，我可以安全返回拉瓜迪亚机场
And the Airbus simulation say I could make it back to LaGuardia safely.

441
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:54,082
可那根本没道理啊
But that doesn't make sense.

442
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:59,017
和我在驾驶舱的亲身感受完全不一致啊
Dosen't jibe with every... everything I felt in the cockpit.

443
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,032
那你为什么要那样做，萨利？
Then why did you do it, Sully?

444
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,025
为什么要在水上降落？
Why land on the water?

445
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,050
没有比那更危险的事了
Cause that's the most dangerous thing you could've done.

446
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,005
欢迎来到拉瓜迪亚机场
Welcome to LaGuardia.

447
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,045
下午好，古里斯曼女士
Good afternoon, Gurisman.

448
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
金枪鱼三明治还是火腿三明治
The tuna # or ham #

449
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:25,027
肯定要金枪鱼三明治，新鲜可口
The tuna basil precisely #, very fresh.

450
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,017
- 谢谢  - 注意安全
- Thank you.  - Be careful out there.

451
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
今天太冷，冻死了
Too cold today, too much cold.

452
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,060
你什么时候跟我一起飞行啊？
When do you gonna come fly with me？

453
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,062
等全美航空开通到海德拉巴的航线再说吧
When US Airways starts fly to Hyderabad.

454
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:42,002
我会跟董事长提议的，看能否被公司采纳
I will talk to the chairman, see what we could work out.

455
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,055
看在老天的份上
Oh for Heaven's sake.

456
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:48,067
- 是他的生日啊  - 不行，老妈
- It's his birthday.  - No, mom.

457
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,032
给他买点什么吧
Let's get him something.

458
00:26:50,037 --> 00:26:52,090
行李箱里已经塞满了给威尔的礼物
The suitcase is already overstuffed with gift for Will.

459
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,012
在机场买东西总是乐趣多多
Always fun to get something from the airport.

460
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,085
有种旅游的感觉
Feels like you travels too.

461
00:26:56,097 --> 00:27:01,030
老妈，他才满1岁，哪分得清礼物是哪买的
Mom, he's turning one, don't think Will could discerning what gift came from where.

462
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:02,060
可我知道
But I will.

463
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:08,010
买个雪景球如何，他会记得的礼物，有纽约气氛的
Maybe a Snow globe, something he'll remember, something New York.

464
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:09,077
我们小时候你有这么大方吗？
Were you this generous when we were kids?

465
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:13,007
好吧，宝贝，我也给你买个雪景球
OK, sweet heart, I'll get you a Snow globe too.

466
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,080
走吧，老妈
Come on, mom.

467
00:27:28,052 --> 00:27:30,022
- 下午好，希拉  - 机长好
- Good afternoon, Sheila.  - Captain.

468
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,087
- 嗨，多琳，堂娜  - 机长
- Hi, Doreen, Donna.  - Captain.

469
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:35,062
- 杰夫  - 嘿
- Jeff.  - Hey.

470
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:42,035
嗨，杰夫
Hey guys, Jeff.

471
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:43,055
我们肯定赶不上了
We're not gonna make it.

472
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:44,055
我为这次旅行准备了一年，老爸
I'm been waiting a year for this trip, Dad.

473
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:45,080
我们才不会错过航班的
We're not gonna miss the flight.

474
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,065
我们登机口见，好吗？
Just meet us at the gate, OK?

475
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,075
待会见，罗比叔叔
See you there, uncle Robby.

476
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,050
高度表校正，30.23英寸汞柱
Altimeter verified, three zero two three.

477
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:55,085
30.23英寸汞柱
three zero two three.

478
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:01,020
起飞检查单确认完毕
Start checklist complete.

479
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:06,030
你真认为他们会放行？
You really think they'll release us?

480
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,045
查看了最新的预报，我们到夏洛特是畅通无阻的
Check the latest report, we're clear all the way to Charlotte.

481
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,030
那去吃牛排吧
Then steaks.

482
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:15,030
德尔·弗雷斯科餐馆，我请
Del Frisco, on me.

483
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:16,047
我从没去过
I never been.

484
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:18,025
不过听人夸过
And  I hear good things.

485
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,007
大黄酱会让你爱到心碎的
Rhubarb will break your heart.

486
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,027
其实嘛，我更偏爱T骨排
You know, I'm more of a porterhouse man.

487
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,045
吃T骨排会让你心梗的
Porterhouse stop your heart.

488
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:32,043
全美航空飞往夏洛特的1549号航班停止售票
Now close for USA Airways flight fifteen forty-nine service to Charlotte

489
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:33,052
等等，等等我们...
Wait, wait, we gonna...

490
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,088
嗨，抱歉，是精神航空让我过来的
Hi, I'm sorry, Spirit sent us.

491
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:40,015
我们的航班取消了，他们说这可以转机
We got canceled and they said we're rerouted.

492
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:41,022
你们这还有空位吗？

493
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,042
停止售票了
Flight is closed.

494
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,015
等等，你看见那边一瘸一拐的老头了吗？
Wait, wait, see that old guy leap up right there?

495
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,047
那是我爸，有要紧事，他必须得赶上这班飞机
That's my dad, it's a emergency, he got to be on this flight.

496
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,000
什么要紧事？
What kind of emergency?

497
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:52,042
- 打高尔夫  - 航班取消了？
- Golf emergency.  - The flight canceled?

498
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:53,017
可能吧
Probably

499
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:55,090
请把证件给我
IDs please.

500
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:58,096
- 买几张票？   - 三张，谢谢
- How many of you travelling?   - Three, thank you.

501
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,022
没有连座了
Nothing together.

502
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,015
没关系，终于买到票了
That's how... well, finally.

503
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:05,000
票拿好

非常感谢
Thank you so much.

509
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,052
- 太好了  - 快乐收场
- Yes!  - Happy ending.

510
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,070
- 她对我“放电”了  - 你个风骚男
- She give me the eyes.  - Charming bastard.

511
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,092
- 嗨，你好啊  - 欢迎赶上末班车
- Hi, how is going.  - Lucky you made it.

512
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:21,005
- 嗯，就是  - 是啊
- Yeah, no kidding.  - Yeah, right.

513
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,092
谢谢，借过
Thank you, I'm sorry.

514
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,005
- 你坐6排，杰夫？  - 那是吉米的位置
- You're in six Jeff?  - Oh, that's all Jimmy.

515
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:26,070
我昨晚熬到3点，得补会儿觉
I was up untill 3, I got to get some sleep.

516
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:27,097
你可以睡这里啊
You could sleep here.

517
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,027
算了吧，你一路上肯定会说个不停的高尔夫
don't know, with you voluble around the course all the time.

518
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:31,060
我打算晚上打高尔夫
"I think I'll play # on the night，Jeff"

519
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,090
免了，再见
No, no, good night.

520
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:37,030
抱歉，借个过
Sorry, excuse me.

521
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:44,022
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thanks.  - Yeah, of course.

522
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,017
你们好，我的座位在里面
Hey guys, I'm in here.

523
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:51,052
他就喜欢乱扔东西
He likes to throw everything.

524
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,032
那刚好，我喜欢接东西
It's perfect, I like to catch everything.

525
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,032
你好啊
Hello there.

526
00:29:55,075 --> 00:29:57,015
我昨晚在google里搜了你
I google you last night.

527
00:29:58,027 --> 00:30:01,032
听说过你有个公司和网站
Heard all about your company, your website.

528
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:03,072
让人刮目相看啊
It's impressive.

529
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,020
谢谢
Thanks.

530
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,007
我还以为自己很能吹牛呢，可跟你比？
I thought I was a good bullshitter, but you?

531
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:12,007
你可以以此谋生了
You could go pro.

532
00:30:12,092 --> 00:30:14,000
我只是开玩笑
I'm always teasing.

533
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,037
不过你的网站的确让人以为是个航空安全咨询公司
But your site does make it sound like a air safety consultancy business

534
00:30:18,037 --> 00:30:21,037
那种员工上百，在三个州都有总部的公司
that's got about 100 employees, and headquarters in three states.

535
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:23,040
然后我又再查了查
And I dug a little deeper.

536
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,007
才意识到只有你一人
then I realise there's only you.

537
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:28,012

00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:10,057
这不是真的
Oh, this isn't happening.

670
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:14,032
水面降落肯定会机毁人亡的
People aren't surviving water landing...

671
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,037
拉起，拉起
Pull up, pull up.

672
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,015
我们要承受撞击了
We're gonna brace.

673
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,015
我得挂了
I better go.

674
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,032
我真替你遗憾
I am so sorry.

675
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:41,085
我爱你
I love you.

676
00:38:43,052 --> 00:38:45,032
嗯，我得挂了
Yeah, I got to go.

677
00:38:56,027 --> 00:39:00,087
...刚从纽约拉瓜迪亚机场起飞，前往北卡罗来纳的夏洛特
...just taking off from New York LaGuardia airport bound for Charlotte, North Carolina.

678
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:05,065
一场突如其来的灾难席卷全美航空1549号航班
And then an imediate disaster struck US Airways flight fifteen forty-nine.

679
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:09,062
很可能是鸟群撞进了飞机的两台发动机
Possible birds flew in both aircraft's engines.

680
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:11,067
机长立即意识到
The Polit quickly realised...

681
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,030
返回机场是没法办到的
he can not return to the airport.

682
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:16,012
并且鲜有其他可行方案
And his option severely limited.

683
00:39:16,027 --> 00:39:18,095
唯一能降落的地方就是哈德逊河
The only place he can go down is the Hudson River.

684
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,002
可选择在哈德逊河上降落
But choosing to land on Hudson.

685
00:39:33,002 --> 00:39:34,075
仍然是个大大的问号
That was still the big if.

686
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:37,022
你最近家里有什么烦心事吗？
have you had any trouble at home lately?

687
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,037
你为什么要这样做，萨利？
Why did you do it, Sully?

688
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:39,097
为什么要在水上降落？
Why land on the water?

689
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:42,032
萨利，你使出了浑身解数，要求不能再高了
Sully, you did everything you could, it's more than enough.

690
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:45,095
所有的计算机模拟都证明返回拉瓜迪亚机场是可能的
Every computer simulation demonstrate that return to LaGuardia was possible.

691
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:48,000
左翼发动机仍然在空转
The left engine was still operating at idle

692
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:49,070
有足够的高度和速度...
There're enough altitude and speed...

693
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,095
可以成功降落在拉瓜迪亚机场
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

694
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,020
没有比那更危险的事了
It's the most dangerous thing you could've done.

695
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
“无畏号”海洋航空航天博物馆

696
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,070
F-4鬼怪II战斗机

697
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,070
测试11，终止投弹演练
Tester one one, abort test bombing run.

698
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:22,057
应急飞行控制系统故障
and an emergency flight control malfunction.

699
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:23,077
2号机跟我组队
2 join on me.

700
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,040
明白，2号机跟你组队
Roger that, 2 join on you.

701
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:27,047
你操纵液压系统
You fly hydraulic.

702
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,045
长官，我们要弹射逃生吗？
Sir, do we need a punch out?

703
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:32,017
不用，我还能驾驭，执行控制检测
No, I can still fly, running a control test.

704
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:33,077
拿出检查单
Get a checklist.

705
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:35,020
我要来查一查
I'm gonna chect this out.

706
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,030
增加推力，我们需要高度
Increase thrust, we need altitude.

707
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,040
坐稳，我们要爬升了
Hold on, we gonna climb.

708
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,070
塔台，测试11，应急飞行控制系统故障
# Tower, Tester one one with emergency flight control malfunction.

709
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,002
我们需要直线进近
We need a straight in approach.

710
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:48,085
明白，测试11
Roger that, Tester one one

711
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,040
转左航向200，跑道3
Turn left of two zero zero, to runway three.

712
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,077
没法办到，我重复，我需要直线进近
Unable, I repeat, I need a straight in approach.

713
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,035
那好，直线进近降落到跑道21
OK, proceed straight head to runway two one.

714
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,095
跑道21，好的
Two one, OK.

715
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:02,075
2号机，我现在减速
2, I'm decreasing speed.

716
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,062
检查我的受损情况
Clear for a # damage check.

717
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:15,002
1号机，你尾部一直冒烟
1, # still trailing smoke.

718
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:17,042
明白，2号机，飞向跑道21
Roger that, 2, on the approach runway two one.

719
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,055
1号机，我会跟着你
1, maintain chasing, follow you in.

720
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,067
我看见跑道了，我们的航向是多少？
I have vision on the runway. What's our heading?

721
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:33,025
航向是020，距跑道8公里，长官
You heading zero two zero, five miles out, sir.

722
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,052
好的，3秒钟后放下起落架
All right, gearing in three.

723
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,007
测试机11，检查你的速度
Tester 11, check your air speed.

724
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:43,072
你好像不对劲
Looks you come in wrong.

725
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,010
塔台，我需要速度来维持控制
# tower, I need speed to maintain control.

726
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,015
终止
Aborting...

727
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,075
1号机，检查你的航向，你要冲出跑道了
1, check your heading, you're not gonna make the runway.

728
00:41:54,027 --> 00:41:55,002
我能搞定
I got it.

729
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,090
能降落
We're back.

730
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:16,057
长官，你降落得真漂亮
That was a hell of landing, sir.

731
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:18,097
我还以为回不来了
I didn't think we're gonna make it.

732
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,075
你们再喝我就要收钱了，好吗？
I'm gonna start charging any these stuff. All right.

733
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,027
- 听懂了？  - 懂
- You hear me?  - Yes.

734
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:56,032
嗨
Hey.

735
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,020
想点什么就跟我说
Let me know if you need anything.

736
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:01,087
可仍旧让人不敢相信的是
But what still seems so hard to believe is...

737
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:04,015
机上所有人都幸免于难
that everyone aboard the plane survive.

738
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:07,085
包括在救生筏上发现的两名瑟瑟发抖的婴儿
Including two shivering baby who were found in a life raft.

739
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:08,065
嘿
Hey...

740
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,065
你不就是？
Is that you?

741
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:13,067
你就是那个机长，萨利？
Are you the pilot, Sully?

742
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,000
- 就是你，对吧？  - 是我
- That is you, right?  - Yes.

743
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,080
嘿，见到你很荣幸
Hey, it's a plesure to meet you.

744
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,005
你那天的壮举简直是超乎想象
That was unreal what you did the other day.

745
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:23,025
那可真是了不起
That was real something.

746
00:43:24,012 --> 00:43:25,080
真高兴能见到你本人，你知道吗
It's a real plesure to meet you, you know.

747
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:28,022
我们用你命名了一种酒
We invented a drink after you.

748
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,030
就在那件事发生后，对吧，约翰尼？
As soon as that happened. ain't that right, Johnny?

749
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,022
你说的对，给我来一杯吧
Yes, you did. Actually I should take one.

750
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:34,020
萨利酒
The Sully.

751
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:36,060
一杯灰雁伏特加（撞击飞机的是加拿大雁，身上多为灰褐色）
It's a shot of Gray Goose...

752
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:40,000
再喷上点水
with a splash of water.

753
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:41,082
喷点水
A splash of water.

754
00:43:44,052 --> 00:43:46,010
嘿，听我说
Hey, listen.

755
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,000
敬1月15号
To January 15.

756
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,017
今年最好的一天
Best day of year.

757
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,017
- 敬萨利  - 敬萨利

758
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,055
嘿，皮特
Hey, Pete.

759
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,020
萨利在这，萨利又在那
Sully is here, and he's there.

760
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,072
他是无处不在啊
Damn, he's everywhere.

761
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,020
是啊
Yeah.

762
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,007
萨利
Sully!

763
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:10,015
像个超级英雄
Like a real hero.

764
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:21,095
我们一号码头见
#, I'll see you on 1.

765
00:44:22,045 --> 00:44:23,000
好
Agree.

766
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,062
21名乘客，船长，预报说华盛顿大桥附近有结冰
Twenty one people onboard, Cap. Weather report said it's icy out by the GW.

767
00:44:32,082 --> 00:44:34,075

00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:37,020
21人乘坐TJ号，从曼哈顿出发
21 on the TJ, pull out of midtown, #

769
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,060
难以置信
Unbelievable.

770
00:44:51,027 --> 00:44:53,007
我不敢相信你居然有胆这样说
I can not believe you have the sack to say that.

771
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:55,015
那简直就是对全体市民竖中指
That's literally like giving entire city the finger.

772
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:57,070
我还要再说一遍，丹尼斯·艾克斯利是公认的
I'll say it again. Dennis Eckersley without question...

773
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,090
棒球史上最伟大的终结者
the greatest pitcher in the history of the baseball.

774
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:01,007
你特别崇拜他的抬腿击
Are you blinded by the leg kick,

775
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,097
是这个原因吗？还是你喜欢他的胡子？
is that what it is? or the mustache?

776
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:05,050
你只是嫉妒我们扬基球迷罢了
You just jealous you were never a yankee.

777
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:06,052
嫉妒？
Jealous?

778
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,002
...现在翻到第7页...
...now turn to page 7...

779
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:44,080
拉起
Pull up.

782
00:45:48,032 --> 00:45:49,042
让我来抱吧
Let me hold it.

783
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:51,007
没事的，有我帮忙

784
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:53,052
头埋下，埋好了

785
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,032
...准备，准备
...brace, brace.

786
00:45:56,032 --> 00:45:58,090
- 头埋下，埋好了  - 我们逃生无望了，叔叔罗比
- Heads down, stay down.  - I don't think we gonna make it, Uncle Robby.

787
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:01,067
- 准备，准备，准备  - 我爱你，妈妈
- Brace, brace, brace.  - I love you, mom.

788
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,082
头埋下，埋好了
Heads down, stay down.

789
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,050
有月亮和星辰
There's moon，the stars.

790
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:06,007
总有一条生路的
There's always a way.

791
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:09,017
头埋下，埋好了
Heads down, stay down.

792
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,015
现在该怎么办？
What we do, darling?

793
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,032
天啊
Oh my God.

794
00:46:56,057 --> 00:46:57,050
疏散
Evacuate.

795
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,020
立即疏散
Evacuate.

796
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:03,077
请穿上救生衣
Grab your life vest please.

797
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,022
打开前门
Opening front door

798
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:16,002
水里面有血
There's blood in water.

799
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,022
罗伯·柯罗杰，老爸
Rob Kolodjay, dad.

800
00:47:21,077 --> 00:47:24,035
大家听我说，这个紧急出口无法使用
Everyone, # exit unusable.

801
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,095
请前往机翼紧急出口
Move forward to the overwing exit.

802
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:28,075
别急在这，赶快过去
Don't line there, now.

803
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:41,060
快走，快走
Go, go.

804
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:44,027
往前走
Move forward

805

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,082
现在跟你通话就好像做梦一样
I can not believe that I'm talking to you.

942
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,030
小心脚下，我扶着你
Watch you step, I got you.

943
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,060
机长，机长
Captain, Captain.

944
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:31,015
上级要我现在把你送去见布隆伯格市长和警察局长雷蒙德·凯利
I'm here to escort you imediately to mayor Bloomberg and police commissioner Raymond Kelly.

945
00:59:31,022 --> 00:59:33,075
要是市长想打声招呼，他得亲自跑一趟了，我们这还忙着工作呢
If the Mayor wants to say hello, he'll have to come down here. We're still working.

946
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:35,072
萨利，我会通知你统计进展的
Sully, I can keep sending you the count.

947
00:59:38,037 --> 00:59:40,015
杰夫，我需要统计总人数，我们得立即去办
Jeff，I need a count, we got to have a count.

948
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:41,047
萨利，现在是不可能统计出总人数的
There is no way getting a real count here, Sully.

949
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,012
还是先给你找几件干衣服穿上吧，不然你要冻坏了
Let's get you wear some dry clothes before you freeze out.

950
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,087
机长，市长和局长凯利亲自来这里见你如何？
Captain, what if Mayor and Chief Kelly come down here to meet with you.

951
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,077
丹，因为这是架国内航班
Dan, because it was a domestic flight.

952
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:51,017
对，所以我们没有旅客名单
Yes, we got no manifest.

953
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:54,027
我们得一个个的查旅客信息，才有可能做出统计
We gonna have to track passengers information now one by one.

954
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,055
- 你能找人帮忙吗？  - 可以
- Can you get any help?  - Yes.

955
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,085
我马上给肖恩打电话，帮你统计出总人数
I'm gonna call Sean# and get your count.

956
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,070
萨利听我一句，你已经尽心尽力了，现在就让我来接手吧
Sully listen, you done enough, let me take it from here.

957
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,007
杰夫？
Jeff?

958
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,017
老爸
Pa.

959
01:00:14,095 --> 01:00:15,070
我没事
I'm okay.

960
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,065
我在另一边的机翼上，救援人员接我到了新泽西
I was on the other wing, they brought us to Jersey.

961
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,047
我看不到你
I, I couldn't see you.

962
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,032
也找不到你
I couldn't find you.

963
01:00:21,072 --> 01:00:23,062
我听见你一直在喊我的名字
I can hear you shouting my name the whole time.

964
01:00:24,057 --> 01:00:26,055
我也喊回去的，我猜河水...
I shouted back, I guess the river...

965
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,002
- 你没事吧？  - 我爱你，儿子
- Are you okay?  - I love you son.

966
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,030
我也爱你
I love you too.

967
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,002
我们大难不死
We made it.

968
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,035
飞机坠落...
The plane crashed...

969
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,020
到河上
on the river.

970
01:00:41,062 --> 01:00:42,090
这谁敢相信？
Are you kidding me?

971
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:48,040
难以置信
Unbelievable.

972
01:01:06,022 --> 01:01:08,082
我从未如此开心自己能回到纽约
I have never been so happy to be in New York in my life.

973
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,015
嘿，伙计
Hey, man.

974
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:25,010
苏让我来找你，每个人都很激动
Soo send me looking for you. Every is running # so top.

975
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,022
- 你不去吗？  - 我猜你还不知道吧
- Won't you coming?  - I guess you didn't hear.

976
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,090
我的全美航空1549掉到哈德逊河里了
I lost Cactus fifteen forty-nine in the Hudson.

977
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:32,005
我猜你还没听说吧
I guess you hadn't heard.

978
01:01:32,005 --> 01:01:33,097
他水面迫降成功
He landed the son of a bitch.

979
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:35,027
什么？
What?

980
01:01:35,045 --> 01:01:38,007
所有人都得救了，奇迹再现啊
Everyone is being pulled off, it's a miracle.

981
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,080
我还以为机毁人亡了
I thought I lost them all.

982
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,037
- 这里肯定有电视的吧  - 肯定有
- It got to be a TV in here.  - Yes, seriously.

983
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:46,070
我脉搏多少？
What is my pulse rate?

984
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,055
110
One ten.

985
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:51,060
我正常脉搏是55
My normal resting figure is 55.

986
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:53,012
110
One ten.

987
01:01:54,032 --> 01:01:55,027
不太妙啊
It's not good.

988
01:01:55,072 --> 01:01:58,000
你说得对，110是不妙
You're right, 110 is not good.

989
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,052
可你刚从鬼门关走了一遭，110已经是相当不错了
But for what you just went through, one ten is extraordinary.

990
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:03,032
多琳的情况如何？
How is Doreen?

991
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:04,092
割了道深口子
Fairly severe laceration.

992
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,027
我们会留院观察她一两天，以防感染
But we'll keep her a day or two to stem the infection.

993
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,022
那她不会有其他问题了？
But she should be okay?

994
01:02:08,045 --> 01:02:10,072
她会留下个伤疤，还有个英雄事迹可传颂
She'll has scar, but a hell of story to tell.

995
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,022
尽管我不相信，尽管你现在就在我眼前
Although I don't believe it, hell, but I'm standing here with you right now.

996
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:14,017
可我不相信
And I don't believe it.

997
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,020
你把飞机降落在哈德逊河上，尽然能毫发无损
You landed a plane on Hudson without a scratch.

998
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,097
工会今天把重量级人物都派出来了啊
The Union is pulling out all of big gun today.

999
01:02:23,045 --> 01:02:24,062
我刚跟丹谈过，萨利
I talked to Dan, Sully.

1000
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,077
155？
One fifty five?

1001
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:34,017
是正式的数字
It's official.

1002
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:36,027
- 155?  - 155.
- One fifty five？  - One fifty five.

1003
01:02:40,092 --> 01:02:41,065
155.
One fifty five.

1004
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:44,005
谢谢你，巴里
Thank you, Barry.

1005
01:03:16,045 --> 01:03:17,082
- 嘿，卡尔  - 杰夫
- Hey, Carl.  - Jeff.

1006
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,050
- 萨利  - 卡尔
- Sully.  - Carl.

1007
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,000
你今天的表演可真是惊世骇俗啊
Hell of thing you pulled off out there today.

1008
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,077
我也就不想那么多了
That's all I know at the moment.

1009
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:29,050
哦，这位是梅女士，酒店的人，想跟你们聊两句
Oh, this is Mrs May, with the hotel, want to have a quick word with you.

1010
01:03:29,057 --> 01:03:31,010
我不会占用两位先生太多时间
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1011
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,010
来这的目的是想跟你们说明，我和酒店员工绝对会保护你们的隐私
This is only to say my stuff and I are committed to protect your privacy.

1012
01:03:34,012 --> 01:03:36,032
所以，需要我做什么尽管开口
So, if there is anything I can do at all.

1013
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,090
如果可以，今晚你们把我的制服拿去干洗一下吧
If it's possible, I love to have my uniform dry cleaning over night.

1014
01:03:40,002 --> 01:03:41,032
我就只有这身衣服
It's the only clothing I have.

1015
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,015
干洗？
Dry cleaning?

1016
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:44,052
如果要求过分了点，又或者时间太晚
If it's too much, too late...

1017
01:03:44,055 --> 01:03:45,030
你不是开玩笑吧？
Are you kidding?

1018
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:48,025
萨伦伯格机长，如果可以我连整座酒店都可以包给你
Captain Sullenberger, I would give this whole hotel if I could.

1019
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,042
好了
Oh, okay.

1020
01:03:53,075 --> 01:03:55,085
谢谢你，伊夫林，非常感谢
Thank you, Evelyn. Thank you very much.

1021
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:57,020
为了萨利做什么都行
Anything for Sully.

1022
01:03:58,035 --> 01:03:59,012
希望你们住得愉快
Have a blissful day.

1023
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,062
刚是怎么一回事？
What just happened?

1024
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:04,077
陌生人第一次见面就主动抱你
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

1025
01:04:06,057 --> 01:04:07,067
好了，萨利
Come on, Sully.

1026
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:09,085
你上一次听说有人把喷气式飞机降落在水上
When was the last time you heard someone...

1027
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:12,007
然后所有人都生还的
landing a jet plane on the water.

1028
01:04:12,092 --> 01:04:14,007
还是哪个朝代的事？
And everybody lived?

1029
01:04:16,095 --> 01:04:17,062
我说的没错吧
Exactly.

1030
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:20,097
我给你们拿了剃须膏，剃须刀片
I got shaving cream, razor blades.

1031
01:04:23,037 --> 01:04:25,017
还有新衣服
And new clothes.

1032
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,017
你觉得我们俩像忍者？
why, you think we were ninjas?

1033
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:30,020
只有凯马特还开着门
Kmart is still open.

1034
01:04:30,052 --> 01:04:33,030
这里是皇后区，又是夜里10点，能找到一家超市开门就不错了，哥们
It's Queen, it's 10 o'clock in the evening, you find a grocery, brother.

1035
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:34,025
嗯
Yeah.

1036
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:36,050
萨利
Sully.

1037
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:38,072
你干嘛还穿着制服？
Why do you even still wear your uniform?

1038
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,032
我不知道
I don't know.

1039
01:04:41,047 --> 01:04:43,045
你们今天都忙了一整天
Look, guys, it's been a long day.

1040
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:45,000
早点休息好吗？
Why don't you get some rest?

1041
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:49,010
麦克·克利里明早8点过来，你们俩到时要做好准备
Mike Cleary will be over in the 8 am, make sure you both doing okay.

1042
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,022
- 谢谢你，卡尔  - 也谢谢你，机长
- Thank you, Carl.  - Thank you, Captain.

1043
01:04:52,087 --> 01:04:55,022
实话说，纽约好长时间都没这种好消息了
You know, it's been a while since New York has news this good.

1044
01:04:56,085 --> 01:04:58,012
特别是和飞机有关的
Especially with airplane.

1045
01:05:08,027 --> 01:05:09,075
明天见，萨利
I'll see you later, Sully.

1046
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,082
宁可延误，不酿灾难
A delay is better than a disaster.

1047
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:35,032
市政官员不断提及的一个词是“时机”
The word city official keep repeating is 'timing'.

1048
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:37,072
纽约警察局潜水小队和拖船船长
The perfect timing of NYPD Scuba Unit...

1049
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:40,070
到达现场的绝佳时机
and the ferry boat Captain...

1050
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:44,077
当然还有机长不可思议的精确时机
and of course the inexplicably precise timing of the pilot.

1051
01:05:45,032 --> 01:05:49,000
萨伦伯格机长，不浪费一分一秒...
Captain Sullenberger, who with almost no time...

1052
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:53,030
这是克莉斯汀·约翰逊...
This is Christine Johnson...

1053
01:05:54,002 --> 01:05:55,000
在哈德逊河进行的现场报道
reporting live from the Hudson River.

1054
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,027
纽约一台播出海岸警卫队拍摄的...
New York One # Coast Guard new video...

1055
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,077
1549号航班紧急降落在哈德逊河上的视频
flight fifteen forty-nine making an emergency landing on the Hudson.

1056
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:01,012
与此同时，飞机发动机的搜寻工作也正在展开
Meanwhile, the search is on engine of the aircraft.

1057
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:07,092
嘿，萨利...
Hey, Sully, you...

1058
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:16,085
快点接啊
Come on, answer.

1059
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,015
拉里，驾驶舱通话记录仪的听证会还有不到2天就要开了
Larry, the CDR is in two days.

1060
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,080
我要你帮个忙，多快能办好？
How fast can you arrange a favor？

1061
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,052
萨利？
Sully?

1062
01:06:24,092 --> 01:06:28,015
我知道空客已经把A320模拟的时间安排发给了工厂
I know the Airbus has simulation schedule for the A320 sent at the factory.

1063
01:06:28,072 --> 01:06:30,022
可那是下周在图卢兹
But that's next week at Toulouse.

1064
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:32,020
你能让他们重新安排时间吗?
Can you get them too reschedule?

1065
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,067
现在是凌晨1点半
It's 1:30 in the morning.

1066
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,035
我需要你把模拟的时间改到我们听驾驶舱通话录音之前
I need you to make it happen before we listen to the CDR.

1067
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,040
在我们的证词完成之前
Before our testimony is complete.

1068
01:06:38,067 --> 01:06:39,052
为什么？
Why？

1069
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:42,085
观看计算机模拟是我的权利
I have a right to see the simulation.

1070
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:44,077
而且我感觉人类驾驶员和计算机有着本质区别
And I had a feeling that with human pilot，it's not a computer.

1071
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,017
结果可能会大不相同
The results are going to be different.

1072
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:49,005
如果它们给出的结果是一模一样呢？
What if they show the exact same result?

1073
01:06:50,015 --> 01:06:53,020
如果一样，我就退休不干了
If they do, then I'll hand you my wing to myself.

1074
01:06:54,007 --> 01:06:55,002
这一切都关系到时机，拉里
It's all about the timing, Larry.

1075
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,000
不需要赶时间的话，你什么事情都能办好
You can accomplish anything if you're never in a hurry.

1076
01:06:57,032 --> 01:06:58,062
我要举双手赞成
I sure as hell agree with that.

1077
01:06:59,032 --> 01:07:00,067
我猜驾驶舱通话记录仪的听证会是在周三
I bet, CVR is on Wednesday.

1078
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:03,045
那只有36个小时了，你能办妥吗？
That's 36 hours, can you make it happen?

1079
01:07:03,057 --> 01:07:04,067
我尽力，可能要打爆电话了
I'll try. It's a lot phone calls.

1080
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,030
现在法国已经是早上7点半了
Well, it's already 7:30 in the moring in France.

1081
01:07:07,092 --> 01:07:10,030
你最好马上开始吧，谢谢你，拉里，谢谢
So you better get started, thank you Larry, thank you.

嘿，罗琳
Hey, Lorraine.

1084
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,057
嗨，抱歉听证会前还给你打电话
Hi, I'm sorry bother you before the hearing.

1085
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:35,040
亲爱的，出什么事了？
Sweetheart, what happened?

1086
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:40,025
我，我才刚意识到
I just, I realize just now...

1087
01:07:41,027 --> 01:07:42,030
终于回过神来...
for the first time that there were...

1088
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:46,015
那机上有155人，而你就是其中之一
there were one hundred fifty five people on that plane, and you're one of them.

1089
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:51,000
我们差点失去你
We almost lost you.

1090
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:53,045
可你们没有啊
But you didn't.

1091
01:07:53,082 --> 01:07:54,085
我还好好的
I'm right here.

1092
01:07:56,082 --> 01:07:58,002
你能挺住吗
How are you holding up?

1093
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,022
我能挺住
I'm hoding up.

1094
01:08:01,037 --> 01:08:02,030
请告诉我这个难关就要过去了
Please tell me this is almost over.

1095
01:08:02,092 --> 01:08:03,065
- 这个难关就要过去了  - 好
- It's almost over.  - Okay.

1096
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,090
我也爱你
I love you too.

1097
01:08:08,027 --> 01:08:09,020
我这边完事了再给你打电话
I'll call you when they're done with me.

听证会场

1100
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:40,047
- 萨利  - 嘿，拉里
- Sully.  - Hey, Larry.

All right, good moring, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome.

1103
01:08:57,042 --> 01:08:58,020
我是查尔斯·波特
My name is Charles Porter.

1104
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:00,045
国家运输安全委员会指派我来
I'm being asigned by National Transportation Safety Board...

1105
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:02,060
主持今天的公众听证会
to conduct this public hearing here today.

1106
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:04,082
今天要涵盖的内容很多
We have a lot of material to cover.

1107
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:08,037
但在我们听驾驶舱通话录音之前
But before we listen to the Cockpit Vocie Recording.

1108
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,082
我们将会首次同2位先生一起聆听
We would be listening to what for the first time along with you gentlemen.

1109
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:15,032
应机长萨伦伯格和工会的请求
For the request of Captain Sullenberger and the Union.

1110
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:19,082
空中客车公司同意经由卫星向我们传输今天的模拟飞行演示
Airbus has agree to link us by a satellite to today's piloted simulations.

1111
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:21,025
请开启传输
Upload link please.

1112
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:26,067
只是模拟罢了，萨利，这不会改变我对那天的看法
They're just simulations, Sully, won't change my mind about what happened up there.

1113
01:09:27,057 --> 01:09:28,057
可能会改变他们的
Might change theirs.

1114
01:09:38,072 --> 01:09:39,070
鸟群
Birds.

1115
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:43,067
1发减速，2发也减速了
No.1 is rolling back, and No.2.

1116
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:44,062
自动驾驶关闭
Copilot is off.

1117
01:09:46,047 --> 01:09:47,070
- 飞行指引仪关闭  - 关闭
- Flight Director is off.  - Flight Director is off.

1118
01:09:48,092 --> 01:09:52,097
拉瓜迪亚，全美航空1549，双发停车，我们要立即返回
LaGuardia, Cactus fifteen forty-nine, dual engines failure, we have to return to the field.

1119
01:09:53,017 --> 01:09:55,057
好，我要左转返回拉瓜迪亚机场跑道13
Okay, I'm gonna left turn back to LaGuardia one three.

1120
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,065
启动进场航路
Activate the approach for you.

1121
01:09:58,065 --> 01:09:59,080
启动了
It's activated.

1122
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:01,050
跑道13
Runway one three.

1123
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:05,050
下滑台显示清楚
Glide slope comes in nicely.

1124
01:10:06,065 --> 01:10:08,005
- 襟翼2档  - 2档
- Flap two.  - Flap two.

1125
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:10,095
下沉率900
Sink rate nine hundred.

1126
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,002
过低，收回襟翼
Too low, flaps.

1127
01:10:18,045 --> 01:10:20,000
过低，收回襟翼
Too low, flaps.

1128
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:22,005
40   高度过低，收回襟翼
Forty. Too low, flaps.

1129
01:10:22,037 --> 01:10:23,040
30 20
Thirty. Twenty.

1130
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:34,010
成功降落在拉瓜迪亚机场，跑道13
Successfully landing on LaGuardia. Runway one three.

1131
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:36,025
我补充一点
For the record.

1132
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,062
计算机模拟的飞行员也得到同样的结果
The pilots in the computer sim bear the same result.

1133
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,057
接下来尝试泰特伯勒机场
Let's try for Teterboro now, please.

1134
01:10:44,022 --> 01:10:45,050
传输第二场模拟
Upload the second run.

1135
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:51,002
鸟群
Birds.

1136
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,097
设定航向310
Get me the heading three one zero.

1137
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,042
航向310
Heading three one zero.

1138
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,035
给你直接进场泰特伯勒
I'm gonna give you direct to Teterboro.

1139
01:11:03,047 --> 01:11:04,040
直接进场泰特伯勒
Direct to Teterboro.

1140
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,010
1000
One thousand.

1141
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,080
襟翼2档
Flap 2.

1142
01:11:15,012 --> 01:11:16,002
襟翼2档
Flap 2.

1143
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,052
过低，地障
Too low, terrain.

1144
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,047
过低，地障
Too low, terrain.

1145
01:11:27,097 --> 01:11:31,092
50, 40, 30, 20...
Fifty, fouty, thirty, twenty...

1146
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,040
成功降落泰特伯勒机场，跑道19
Successfully landing on Teterboro, runway one nine.

1147
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:46,072
多个机场、跑道，2起成功降落
Mutilple airports, runways, two successful landings.

1148
01:11:47,082 --> 01:11:50,055
我们只是重复下计算机的演算结果
We are simply mimicing what computer already told us.

1149
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,085
为了设置好今天的这套演示设备，可是折腾了不少人
A lot of toes were stepped on in order to set these up for today.

1150
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,035
坦白说吧
And frankly...

1151
01:11:58,032 --> 01:12:00,060
我真不明白你们两位想达到什么目的
I really don't know what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

1152
01:12:01,057 --> 01:12:02,050
我们可以现实点吗？
Can we get serious now？

1153
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:06,005
机长?
Captain?

1154
01:12:06,045 --> 01:12:08,057
我们都听说过计算机模拟
We all heard about computer simulation.

1155
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:11,000
现在也看了实际的模拟演示
And now we are watching actual sims...

1156
01:12:11,005 --> 01:12:12,095
可让我惊讶的是
but I can't quite believe...

1157
01:12:14,017 --> 01:12:18,010
你们仍然没有把人类因素考虑进去
you still have not take into account of human factor.

1158
01:12:18,082 --> 01:12:22,010
人类飞行员操纵的模拟显示你可以返回机场
Human piloted simulations show you could make it back to airport.

1159
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,055
不对，他们办不到
No, they don't.

1160
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:27,020
这些飞行员并不像常人一样行事
These pilots would not behaving like human beings...

1161
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,067
并不像那种初次经历的人一样应对
like people who experiencing this for the first time.

1162
01:12:29,072 --> 01:12:31,052
他们只是不像你那样应对而已
Or they may not be reacting like you did.

1163
01:12:31,057 --> 01:12:34,087
鸟击过后，他们就立即返回机场
Immediately after birds strike, they are turning back for the airport.

1164
01:12:34,087 --> 01:12:37,007
就像计算机演算的一样，对吧？
Just as in the computer sims, correct?

1165
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:41,095
他们显然知道如何转向，飞哪个航向
They obviously knew the turn and exactly what heading to flight.

1166
01:12:42,017 --> 01:12:43,025
他们没有执行检查
They did not run a check.

1167
01:12:43,037 --> 01:12:44,090
他没有打开辅助动力装置
They did not switch on the APU.

1168
01:12:44,097 --> 01:12:46,097
他们用的参数和你当时的一模一样
They had all the same parameters that you faced.

1169
01:12:47,057 --> 01:12:48,075
没人警告过我们
No one warned us.

1170
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:53,095
没人想得到，你会在这种高度遭遇双发停车
No one said you're going to lose both engines at a lower altitude...

1171
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:55,055
前所未有，史上最低
than any jets in history

1172
01:12:56,055 --> 01:12:58,000
可淡定点，只需...
But be cool, just...

1173
01:12:58,087 --> 01:13:02,032
左转返回拉瓜迪亚机场，像去取牛奶一样简单
make a left turn to LaGuardia like you going back to pick up the milk.

1174
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:08,052
这是在853米的高度遭遇双发停车，然后立即执行水面迫降
This was dual engine loss at 2800 feet follow by immediate water landing...

1175
01:13:08,067 --> 01:13:11,025
机上还载有155条鲜活的生命
with one hundred fifty five souls on board.

1176
01:13:11,047 --> 01:13:14,042
没人接受过此类事故的训练
No one has ever trained for incident like that.

1177
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:16,015
没人
No one.

1178
01:13:17,037 --> 01:13:20,077
以那样不切实际的倾斜角在泰特伯勒机场降落
And Teterboro landing with its unrealistic bank angle...

1179
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,085
我们可不是雷鸟飞行表演队（特技飞行）
We are not ThunderBirds up there.

1180
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:26,095
我想知道这个机长对这个动作进行了多少次练习
I like to know how many times the pilot practice that maneuver...

1181
01:13:27,005 --> 01:13:28,045
才能不出差错的成功降落
before he actually pull it off.

1182
01:13:29,055 --> 01:13:31,037
我不是在质疑这些机长的技术
I'm not questioning the pilots.

1183
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:32,052
这些机长都技术过硬
They are good pilots.

1184
01:13:33,085 --> 01:13:38,037
可他们明显受过指示，在遭遇鸟击后就立即返回机场
But they clearly being instructed, head for the airport immediately after the bird strike.

1185
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:41,095
这里面没有故障分析和方案决策过程
You are not allow time for analysis or decision making.

1186
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:46,005
所有的计算机模拟，你们都把人类因素排除在外
Any simulation you taking all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

1187
01:13:47,057 --> 01:13:51,052
这些机长花了多少时间来准备此类事件？
How much time do pilots spend planing for these event?

1188
01:13:51,085 --> 01:13:53,012
来准备这些模拟？
For these simulations.

1189
01:13:56,067 --> 01:13:58,087
你们要是想找人为错误
You're looking for human error.

1190
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:01,067
就把人也考虑进去
Then make a human.

1191
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,065
这可不是电子游戏
This wasn't a video game.

1192
01:14:09,065 --> 01:14:10,087
是生死攸关的
It was life and death.

1193
01:14:12,002 --> 01:14:13,072
萨利的真知灼见，值得你们好好掂量
Sully is right, that's worth you a few seconds.

1194
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,017
请问下那些机长练习了多少次？
Please ask how many practice run they have?

1195
01:14:18,015 --> 01:14:19,007
17次
Seventeen.

1196
01:14:25,032 --> 01:14:26,020
17次？
Seventeen.

1197
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:33,027
降落在泰特伯勒的机长之前有过17次尝试
The pilot who landed at Teterboro has 17 practice attempts...

1198
01:14:33,072 --> 01:14:35,057
才有我们刚观看的模拟结果
before this simulation we just witnessed.

1199
01:14:41,015 --> 01:14:43,080
反应时间会被设定成35秒
The reaction decison time will be set at thirty five seconds.

1200
01:14:45,057 --> 01:14:47,020
35秒有点少了吧
thirty five seconds is not enough time.

1201
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,092
我们总共才用了208秒，所以嘛
We only had two hundred and eight seconds total, so...

1202

不了，就保持在2档

01:24:36,065 --> 01:24:38,057
我出去透个气，马上回来
I need to take a quick break.

1352
01:24:53,092 --> 01:24:55,002
你现在是什么想法？
What do you just think?

1353
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,090
听完驾驶舱通话录音后？
Hear that, CVR just now?

1354
01:25:01,082 --> 01:25:03,000
我跟你说下我的想法
I tell you what I think.

1355
01:25:05,095 --> 01:25:07,042
我感到无比自豪
I'm just so damn proud.

1356
01:25:09,007 --> 01:25:11,090
还有你，你也在驾驶舱，要兼顾那么多的事
And you, you were right there, with all that distraction,

1357
01:25:12,012 --> 01:25:13,037
而局势又凶险万分
and so much at stake.

1358
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:18,052
我们一起扛了过来，我们缺一不可
We did this together, we're a team.

1359
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:21,085
谢谢，萨利

01:26:00,045 --> 01:26:05,015
坦白说，刚才也是我头一回和机长和副驾驶坐在一起
That is honestly the first time that I listen to a crash recording...

1366
01:26:05,067 --> 01:26:09,040
听他们的坠机录音
while actually seating with Captain and first office.

1367
01:26:11,092 --> 01:26:13,000
真是非同寻常
It's extraordinary.

1368
01:26:14,092 --> 01:26:17,007
那可不是模拟
That was no simulation.

1369
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:19,040
对，不是模拟
No, it wasn't.

1370
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:22,045
两位
Gentlemen.

1371
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:27,010
我想告知你们左翼发动机已被捞出
I wanna inform you that the left engine has been recovered.

1372

我们刚收到详细调查报告

1373

发动机上的导流叶片和风扇叶片都受到了大面积损伤

1374

1375

还有一个可变导流叶片丢失

1376
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,052
那就是没推力
So no thrust.

1377
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:50,067
我看了证词，发动机彻底损毁
I see testify, it was completely destroyed.

1378
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:53,022
飞行数据记录器的数据是错的

1379
01:26:58,055 --> 01:27:01,007
我想分享点个人感受

1380
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:04,025
我有绝对的把握这样说
I can say with absolutely confidence that...

1381
01:27:04,087 --> 01:27:07,007
在同其他机组成员、鸟类专家
after speaking with rest of the flight crews,

1382
01:27:07,057 --> 01:27:10,022
还有航空工程师谈过后

在分析过每一种场景后

在访问了每一个责任方后

1385
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,007
结果的拼图仍然少了一块
There's still absence in this result.

1386
01:27:19,032 --> 01:27:21,077
那就是你，机长萨伦伯格
And it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1387
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,042
把你从方程和计算中移除
Remove you from the equation and the math,

1388
01:27:25,052 --> 01:27:26,050
就只有失败

1389
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,037
我不同意
I disagree.

1390

不只是我，是我们所有人
It wasn't just me, it's all of us.

我们都尽力一份力

1395
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:53,040
这才是我们幸存的原因

1396
01:27:57,085 --> 01:27:59,032
副驾驶斯基尔斯

1397
01:28:00,027 --> 01:28:01,065
你有什么想补充的吗
Is there anything you like to add it.

1398
01:28:01,082 --> 01:28:07,082
如果你不得不再经历一次，你会有什么地方做得不同吗
Anything you would've done differently if you had to do it again.

01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:29,070
有超过1200名现场急救员和7艘载有130名乘客的渡轮

1402
01:28:29,077 --> 01:28:32,017
参与对1549航班乘客和机组成员的救援行动

1403
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,027
纽约的骄子齐心协力，整场行动仅耗时24分钟

1404
01:29:48,035 --> 01:29:50,015
- 7F  - 11F

1409
01:30:00,052 --> 01:30:02,027
155是个数字
One hundred fifty five is a number.

1410
01:30:02,045 --> 01:30:05,015
可当你去对应一张张面孔时

1411
01:30:06,037 --> 01:30:08,075
那就不只是155张了
