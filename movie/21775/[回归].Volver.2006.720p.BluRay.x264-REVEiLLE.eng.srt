1
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,823
Put some stones in the vase,
or it'll fall over.

2
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,166
Polish the letters well.

3
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,003
There are so manywidows!

4
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,213
The women here live longerthan the men.

5
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,881
Except poor Mom.

6
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,926
Raimunda, don't saythat!

7
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,388
She died in Dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

8
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,764
Burned to death!

9
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,352
That's the worstwayto die.

10
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,895
Theywere asleep.

11
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,564
They didn't even realize.

12
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,358
Even so,
how can you say something like that?

13
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:49,985
Hello, Agustina.

14
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,073
See you later, Agustina.

15
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,117
-Good morning, Manola.
-Good morning.

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,578
-Is that
everything,
Mom?
-I'll get the
rest.

17
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,956
Good Lord!

18
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,417
-Is this Paula?
-Ofcourse.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,423
She's
got
your father's
eyes.

20
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,551
-How are you?
-Not good.

21
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,053
Don't saythat.

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,267
With this wind, you can't keep it clean.

23
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:29,191
I often come
and sit here on
my own,
and time goes
by.

24
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,069
We're going now,
we have to seeAunt Paula.

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,487
Come and see
me afterwards.

26
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,238
Sure.

27
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,574
How's Paco?

28
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,410
He's fine. He stayed in Madrid, working.

29
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:53,090
like a second home.

30
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,134
-Thatfreaks me out!
-It's tradition here.

31
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,346
-Shall I drive?
-Yes.

32
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,205
Aunt Paula!

33
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,165
Who is it?

34
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,375
Raimunda!

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,794
-Don'ttake all day.
-Don't rush me.

36
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:36,174
All right.

37
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:40,011
How are you, Aunt?

38
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,474
You're
very thin! Have
you had the
baby?

39
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,811
Doesn'ttime fly!

40
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,020
And who are these?

41
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,648
Who do you think? Sole and my Paula!

42
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,316
The same name as me!

43
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,945
And Sole.

44
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,949
Shall we go into the dining room?

45
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:07,664
For heaven's sake!

46
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,837
The wind carried the cindersto the bushes.

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,758
The result isthe mosttragicfire
in the last 13 years.

48
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,511
-Mind if I turn it
off?
-No, I can't see
it anyway.

49
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,182
Fires are dreadful.

50
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,019
Why did I come in here?

51
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,398
-To talk?
-No.

52
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,609
-To get some
food
-Yes!

53
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,527
Look in the sideboard.

54
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,072
I'm very shaky
on my pins.

55
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,533
Look, wafers!

56
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,660
Just like Mom's. Eat up.

57
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,040
How was the
cemetery?

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,876
Your mother is delighted.

59
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,546
Ofcourse.

60
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,298
She likes itto be clean.

61
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,634
lfshe could, she'd clean it herself.

62
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,928
But, ofcourse, she can't.

63
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,515
Ofcourse, she can't.

64
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:14,731
You'd be
better off in a
home,
where you'd be
looked after.

65
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,485
I'm going to the bathroom.

66
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,861
Well, go!

67
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,325
You can't live on yourown.
I'm worried aboutyou.

68
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,245
Very well.

69
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,331
Agustina brings me bread,
your motherdoes the cooking,

70
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,125
and if I need anything I call the store
and they bring it.

71
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,169
I'm fine.

72
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,260
What a lovelytouch!

73
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,388
Look!

74
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,432
It's gotyour name on it.

75
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,643
Shall we go?

76
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,895
Yes.

77
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,398
We're leaving now.

78
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,152
Don't get up.

79
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,321
How could I not get up?

80
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,870
Yes, nexttime.

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,497
What matters is thatyou come back.

82
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,833
You've gotten
very wobbly.

83
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,231
Take care ofyourself.

84
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,441
I will.

85
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:30,200
We'll do that. I love you lots!

86
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,120
-Shall we go toAgustina's?
-Yes.

87
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,964
Come in!

88
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,885
Well?

89
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,222
-Bad.
-Terrible.

90
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,766
She's gotten
very shaky.
I don't know
how she copes.

91
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,310
She does
very well
without going
outside.

92
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,731
She leaves the
money for me.

93
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,941
Let's go onto the patio.

94
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,779
She doesn't knowwhatyear it is.

95
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,407
She talks about Mom
as ifshe were still alive.

96
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,161
She can't accept it.

97
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:25,171
I'm very
happy to do it.

98
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,339
I'd take her home,

99
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:37,809
and I don't move until she answers me.

100
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,686
I keep an eye on her.

101
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,938
I really appreciate that.

102
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,276
I like to think

103
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:51,197
wherevershe is.

104
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,831
Look! Wasn't she cutting edge then?

105
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,626
The only hippie in the village.

106
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,379
Look at her
plastic jewelry.

107
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,175
They're awesome!

108
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,801
First-rate plastic.

109
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,725
Everytime I
smoke ajoint I
think of her.

110
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,686
That's a fine
example you're
setting
for Paula!

111
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,730
There's still no news?

112
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,233
It's like the
earth
swallowed her
up.

113
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,651
And your sister
Brigida?

114
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,736
Her?

115
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,530
She's in Madrid, she's a big hit on trash TV.

116
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,494
Mom, I'm out ofcredit!

117
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,830
Good, we'll get a break from the telephone.

118
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:47,879
As I was
saying,
Brigida is on so
many shows

119
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,090
she can put a
deposit
on an
apartment in
Madrid.

120
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:55,512
So did this one.

121
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,432
you must've
been thirteen,

122
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:05,396
Hey, you nevertold me that!

123
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,066
lt was your
granny's idea.
She was up for
anything.

124
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,445
so as notto ruin yoursister's career.

125
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,239
No.

126
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,366
Mom would love to be on television.

127
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,204
Want some?

128
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,956
No, no, no.

129
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,875
I grow it myself. Look atthe plants.

130
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,214
Yes.

131
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:38,930
She's said it so
often on TV.

132
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,767
Yes, but you have to report
it to the police, not say it onTV.

133
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,727
I don't know.

134
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,482
In any case, it's
notthe first time
she's left home.

135
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,110
But never for
so long.

136
00:10:52,193 --> 00:11:00,326
Youroleander looks wonderful.

137
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,579
Yes, it didn't get aphids this year.

138
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:10,169
No, if
it
weren't
for them,
I wouldn't eat
at all.

139
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,258
Your father's
eyes.

140
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:22,265
Ajoint makes
me feel a bit
hungry,
and it relaxes
me.

141
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,396
Safe journey!

142
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,205
Guess what I saw upstairs
beside the bathroom?

143
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,542
An exercise bike.

144
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,963
Whywould Auntie want a bike
ifshe can'twalk?

145
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:59,636
Don'ttalk like that about her.

146
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,971
She didn't even recognize us.

147
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:07,810
That goddamn Eastwind here
drives people crazy!

148
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:15,401
How can she bake those
when she's as blind as a bat?

149
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,720
Hello, Regina.

150
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,888
Going to work?

151
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,556
Got no choice, love.

152
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,559
Where are you going?

153
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,896
To the club.
lfyou drop me in the centerthat'd be great.

154
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,564
-All right.
-Thanks.

155
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,358
See you later.

156
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,042
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

157
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,127
Hello.

158
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,221
Did you have fun?

159
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,558
In the
cemetery? You
kidding me?

160
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:36,065
Me? What do you mean?

161
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,861
Paula, sit properly. Close your legs!

162
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,906
Will you bring me another beer?

163
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,034
Are you kidding?

164
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,912
Go on, please.

165
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,875
Haven'tyou had enough?
You have to work tomorrow.

166
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,339
I'm free
tomorrow, and
the day after,
too.

167
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,757
How come?

168
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,053
Hang on.

169
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,097
ChristAlmighfy!

170
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,435
I'll get ajob on Sundays,
it's my onlyfree day.

171
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,521
I'll get ajob.

172
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,273
But let me watch the game in peace.

173
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,945
There'll be no more cable.

174
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,032
We're a
poor family, and
we'll live like
one.

175
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,159
Paula, putthat phone down!

176
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,287
Yoursupper's here ifyou want it.

177
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,238
Are you angry?

178
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:10,576
I'm worried about my aunt.

179
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,829
She's worse than ever.

180
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,915
She didn't even recognize Paula and Sole.

181
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,462
-I don't know how she manages.
-But she does.

182
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,134
Leave me be.

183
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:33,057
I'm worn out, and I have to get up early.

184
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,935
I'll do the work.

185
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,440
Don't be a pest!

186
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,241
Don't call me a pest.

187
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,077
Sorry.

188
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,706
Waiting for you.

189
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,832
What for?

190
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:30,132
I don't suppose you thoughtto buy any.

191
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,217
No.

192
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,013
How long have you been here?

193
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,598
Awhile.

194
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,147
No.

195
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:50,152
Why didn'tyou answerthe phone?

196
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,489
What's wrong?

197
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,495
Is something wrong?

198
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,292
Tell me, what's happened?

199
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,174
Where's
your father?

200
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,014
He's...

201
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,307
Where?

202
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,602
In the kitchen.

203
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,615
What happened?

204
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,743
I was in the kitchen

205
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:45,041
and suddenly Dadjumped on me.

206
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,209
He was drunk.

207
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,128
I asked him what he was doing,

208
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,464
and he said he
wasn't my
father.

209
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,885
I pushed him away.

210
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,097
But he got up and put his arms around me.

211
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,060
I pushed him again.

212
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,318
He unzipped his pants.

213
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,488
He kept saying that itwasn'twrong

214
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,156
and that he
wasn't
my father!

215
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,999
and I threatened him,

216
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,168
but itwas onlyto scare him.

217
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,341
He didn't believe me.

218
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,220
He said I wouldn't dare

219
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,015
and hejumped on me.

220
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,524
What are you going to do?

221
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,322
I don't know.

222
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,244
Go and change, oryou'll get pneumonia.

223
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:14,797
and you saw nothing, you weren't here.

224
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,926
It's very
important you
remember that.

225
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,742
Don't open!

226
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:11,247
Go to your room.

227
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,292
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

228
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,505
Coming!

229
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:35,187
I wantto give you the restaurant keys
in case anyone comes to see it.

230
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,525
I don't mind, it'sjust I'm neverat home.

231
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,652
What about Paco? He's always here.

232
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,613
Paco...

233
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,450
He finally got
a job.
He's starting
tomorrow.

234
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,035
Are you hurt?

235
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,539
Women's troubles.

236
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:58,627
with Paco working I'll have more free time.

237
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,631
-Give me the
keys, I'll sort it
out.
-Here.

238
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,510
The other is my cell phone.

239
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,806
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-In the morning.

240
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,685
Tell me, how much are you asking?

241
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:24,278
Forthe lease, five million,
but it's negotiable.

242
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,992
And I'll miss you girls.

243
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,664
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

244
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:46,842
I wantto be with you.

245
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,933
You'll have to help me later.

246
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,854
Don't answer!

247
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,525
It'll be one ofyour pals.

248
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,575
This is no time to be calling.

249
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:19,458
What do you mean? It's yourAunt Sole.

250
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,793
Putyour motheron.

251
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:25,464
Tell her I'm busy.

252
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:31,387
Take the phone, Mom.

253
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,143
Sole, I've got a pile of ironing,

254
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,396
and I was
out working all
afternoon.

255
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,107
Agustina rang.

256
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,608
Aunt Paula is dead.

257
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,485
When?

258
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,736
A little while ago.

259
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,242
Aunt Paula is dead.

260
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,707
Just a minute ago I was thinking of
bringing her here.

261
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:12,803
She and
Squinfy will lay
herout
before we
get there.

262
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,763
Auntie had
everything
organized.

263
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,475
She even chose
her coffin
and paid for
everything.

264
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,312
It's incredible that she was so lucid
atthe end.

265
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,606
I can't go to the funeral.

266
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,275
I'm truly sorry,

267
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,777
but I'm very
busy.

268
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,655
How can you not go?
Whatwill people say?

269
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,824
I can't go, not remotely.

270
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,495
On my own?

271
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:45,169
Butyou needn't seeAuntie.

272
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,881
And if they ask
for you

273
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:53,218
Anything.

274
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,138
I'll go later, buttoday it's not
remotely possible.

275
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:03,062
And I loved her.

276
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:07,191
I'll explain itto you someday,
and that day, you'll flip.

277
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:12,529
Take a tranquilizer.
I'm going to take one, too.

278
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:16,700
All right?

279
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,243
I guess...

280
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,807
The door!

281
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,204
Wait!

282
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,731
You stay here. Stay here and keep watch.

283
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,235
I hope it hasn't changed
since I worked here.

284
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,803
DEEP FREEZE

285
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,096
Sorry.

286
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:15,647
Why?

287
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,857
Give me a hand.

288
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,945
We're shooting a film in the area,

289
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,407
and I'm looking
for somewhere
we can all eat.

290
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,161
Do you know any restaurants around here?

291
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,123
How many are you?

292
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,208
25 and 5... 30.

293
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,087
Come on, help me.

294
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,759
I can do it
for you, if you
want.

295
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,511
We were going to close today.

296
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,348
So, lunch for 30.

297
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:55,937
Around 4:00?

298
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,272
Yeah.

299
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,152
And tell me, how much?

300
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,739
That's fine.

301
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,118
I'm sorry I shouted atyou,

302
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,037
butyou scared me.

303
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,666
-Well, I'll see you at4:00.
-Sure.

304
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,126
Thanks a lot.

305
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,047
It's 10:00!

306
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,304
-Two kilos.
-Give me another two kilos.

307
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,558
How much are the potatoes?

308
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,853
1.60 for four kilos.

309
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,397
Sure.

310
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,864
Hello, you're carting quite a load!

311
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,075
I have to make lunch for 30.

312
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,412
-Could you lend me 100 euros?
-I'm broke, love.

313
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,872
l'vejust bought a chunk of pork this big.

314
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:00,335
It cost me 10.80. It's all I have!

315
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,088
I'll payyou tomorrow. Come on!

316
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,756
I'll bring it overto you now.

317
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,844
It'll do you good.

318
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,933
Hey, lnes! Back from the village?

319
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,103
I got here yesterday. How are you?

320
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,606
Did you happen to bring
any sausages orchorizo?

321
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,192
I certainly did! The sausages are great.

322
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:29,614
-I need a kilo orso.
-Why's that?

323
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,409
-I have to cook for 30.
-Who's coming?

324
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,411
I'll tell you later.

325
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,705
Can I buythem? I'll payyou tomorrow.

326
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,457
-Sure, it's no problem.
-Thanks.

327
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:48,300
With the wayyourglucose
and cholesterol are,

328
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:58,727
-What do I do, give them away?
-Sell them to me.

329
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,437
At least let me taste them.

330
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,274
You can eat three or four,
but don't stuff yourself.

331
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,235
-Bring them round to me, love.
-I'll do that.

332
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,238
Bye, pet.

333

SALAD

336
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,630
Who'd like some pork? It's delicious.

337
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,883
You, too?

338
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,313
Some pork? It's delicious.

339
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,768
Agustina?

340
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,983
Is thatyou?

341
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,241
Soledad,

342
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,368
daughter.

343
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,041
I have to talk to you.

344
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,646
Sole!

345
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,864
There, there.

346
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,199
Take it easy.

347
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,582
Upstairs, in my mother's room,

348
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,543
the best room in the house.

349
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:33,048
Thankyou so much.

350
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,094
Come on, we're the principal mourners.

351
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,560
Good afternoon.

352
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,938
I spoke to yoursister.

353
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,899
She'sjust had an operation.

354
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,903
She said you're notto see the body.

355
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,114
Don't worry, you won't have to.

356
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,928
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

357
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:26,142
We'll let her rest a while, she's very tired.

358
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,687
Come on.

359
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,230
Over here.

360
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,279
ltwas late at night.

361
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,866
I'd had supper,
and I was watching the television.

362
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,496
I heard someone knocking at my door.

363
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:52,168
I wasn't sure, but justthen

364
00:36:52,252 --> 00:37:01,219
And a voice answered,

365
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,512
"Agustina."

366
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,474
I wasn't afraid.

367
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,477
I went outside, but I saw no one.

368
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:20,238
so I went in.

369
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,532
I called youraunt,

370
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,493
but she didn't answer me.

371
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,871
How could she answer me, poorthing?

372
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,419
and I found her there, in bed,

373
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,213
as still as a little bird!

374
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,674
ltwas herspiritthatwarned you.

375
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,927
Butwas it Paula's spirit orthe otherone's?

376
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,429
One of the two.

377
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:50,602
But just as I'm listening to you now,

378
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:55,356
someone orsomething warned me that
Paula had died,

379
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,942
and opened the doorso I could go in.

380
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,029
Come into the kitchen.

381
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:16,795
Not since last night, but I'm all right.

382
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,923
I thought as much.

383
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,132
This'll do you good.

384
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,093
Don't give me any more. That's enough.

385
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,561
What did the women mean?

386
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,817
You knowwhatvillages are like.

387
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,152
Theywere talking about my mother.

388
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,321
Some people saythey've seen her.

389
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,326
They say she came back to look after
your Aunt Paula.

390
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,996
Has she not appeared to you?

391
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:57,585
No, butthose things happen.

392
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:03,091
My grandfather, God rest him, appeared
to my grandmother.

393
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,762
Eat up!

394
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,599
Then she asked him what he wanted,

395
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:16,854
there was a promise he hadn'tfulfilled.

396
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,857
She carried it out,

397
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,195
where they left my grandfather so he'd
rest in peace.

398
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,655
And he neverappeared again.

399
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,330
That isn't just a story I heard.

400
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,915
I lived it.

401
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,867
Do you wantto go into youraunt's house

402
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:19,709
Tell her it went very well
and the whole village came.

403
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,462
I'll do that.

404
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,632
I'm going to miss herso much!

405
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,512
Go on.

406
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,744
Let me out, Sole!

407
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:46,421
I won't do anything to you.

408
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,097
My mother is dead.

409
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,978
lfyou're anything,
you're herghost or herspirit.

410
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:06,482
I'm in the trunk ofyourcar.

411
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:11,821
Really, Mom, the things you do!

412
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,499
Soledad,

413
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,626
daughter,

414
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,547
I'm your mother.

415
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,968
Aren'tyou going to give me a hug?

416
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,399
Now, give me a hand.

417
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,650
Take this.

418
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,656
-Auntie's suitcase!
-Yes.

419
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,579
What is all this?

420
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,582
Clothes and some valuablesAuntie had.

421
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,168
A good thing I hid them
before the neighbors arrived.

422
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:12,757
but I'd gotthere first.

423
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,927
You'll have to give Agustina a girl,
she's been so good.

424
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,598
There was such a fuss
when she didn'tturn up.

425
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,018
lfyou'd heard what Squinfy said about her!

426
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:29,565
I'm wrecked after the trip.

427
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:37,073
-Are you sleeping here?
-Yes, where do you want me to go?

428
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:46,290
That's how I make my living.

429
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:50,127
-Is thatthe guest room?
-Yes, that's it.

430
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:57,718
I don'twantto be stuck in the house all day.

431
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,472
Nobody knows me here.

432
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:07,270
I need a bit ofair.

433
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,899
Are you staying for long?

434
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,569
You wantto throw me out already?

435
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,279
No, I'mjust asking.

436
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:21,117
I'll stay for as long as God wills,
if you don't mind.

437
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:29,834
who's bettercompanythan her mother?

438
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:34,589
Unless you've gotyourselfa sweetie-pie.

439
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,010
I'm alone, like always.

440
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,136
Not anymore.

441
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,307
Answerthe phone.

442
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,103
-Are you back?
-Yes.

443
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,606
You were out of range, so I rang Agustina.

444
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,943
The whole village came.

445
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,778
I've been thinking aboutyou all day.

446
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,031
I reallywanted to be there.

447
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,659
300.

448
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,622
-What do I owe forthe drinks?
-Nothing.

449
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,789
They're on the house.

450
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:17,131
lfyou don't mind,
and even ifyou charge more,

451
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,884
could the helpings be more generous?

452
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,304
Tomorrow,
you'll have food coming out your eyes.

453
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,806
-Great, see you then.
-So long.

454
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,355
Have you got ajob in a restaurant, too?

455
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,857
Yes, I've taken over Emilio's place.

456
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,150
Good Lord!

457
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,401
He was sick of it,

458
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,363
butthat's notthe only news.

459
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,699
That'swhy I couldn't go to the funeral.

460
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,743
We were having a rowwhen you rang.

461
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,912
I knew something was wrong.

462
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,872
Did he hityou?

463
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,875
Paco wasn'tviolent.

464
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,502
He'sjust gone,

465
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,921
forever.

466
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,506
He'll come back, you'll see.

467
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,549
I doubt it.

468
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:03,678
You can tell these things.

469
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,348
Well, so long.

470
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,851
Bye.

471
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,773
None ofthe three of us had any luck
with men.

472
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:20,403
Me, what?

473
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:25,408
Raimunda says thatyou were lucky,

474
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:30,997
Yoursister isn't a bad person,
but she's got a nasfy streak.

475
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:37,378
and he cheated on me until the day he died!

476
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:47,805
But let's drop it.
I don'twantto talk ill ofthe dead.

477
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:52,268
-Is he going to appear?
-I hope not.

478
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:56,147
What about him?

479
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,817
I doubt it.

480
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,278
I haven't heard from him in two years.

481
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,698
All the better.
lt'll just be the two of us together.

482
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,169
The pork costyou 10?

483
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:08,636
And I'll pay you for four boxes cookies,
not three.

484
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,722
I don'twantyou to think I'd cheatyou.

485
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,311
Could you help me with this?
I can't move it on my own.

486
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,564
-Where are you taking it?
-To the restaurant.

487
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,400
You're the expert in removals.
Where do we...

488
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,695
Get ahold of it, tip it over,
but not all the way.

489
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,990
-Otherwise, we won't get it through.
-Is this all right?

490
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,202
Now, straighten up, to the right,
more to the right...

491
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:43,087
Don't rush it.

492
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,215
Are we atthe door?

493
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,177
The elevator is here.

494
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:57,184
You take it.

495
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,561
You're doing fine.

496
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,271
Good Lord! This is tough.

497
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,355
Careful!

498
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,486
Call itfrom downstairs.

499
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,201
I want them to see we don't use frozen food.

500
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:21,125
-And the otherfreezer?
-It's broken.

501
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:32,094
You can count on me.
I make great desserts.

502
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:40,561
-Sure.
-And thanks.

503
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,232
Mom...

504
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,989
Is there anything you want me to do?

505
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,574
Cut my hair.

506
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,994
I mean,

507
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,121
is there anything

508
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,165
you left undone in life

509
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:07,963
People always leave things undone,

510
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,466
ordone badly,

511
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,510
and I'm no exception.

512
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,263
But I don't know ifthey can be fixed.

513
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,015
And ifthey can,

514
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,934
it's up to me to fixthem.

515
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:33,364
They know I'm an orphan.

516
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,324
I'll say I'm a foreigner.

517
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,869
A foreigner? From where?

518
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:39,954
Dominican Republic?

519
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,164
No, there are lots around here,

520
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,166
they'd notice youraccent.

521
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:52,341
Who'd believe you're Chinese?

522
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:56,762
Russian!

523
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,518
Do I really look more Russian than Chinese?

524
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:06,188
Yes, the Russians are like us.

525
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:10,234
Look, whateveryou hear,
keep your mouth shut.

526
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,696
And don't letthem see
thatyou understand us.

527
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,573
I'll show you how everything works.

528
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,700
In the bedroom, I cut, dry, and color,

529
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,576
and here I wash their hair.

530
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:34,383
and if it's down there,

531
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,511
I have to bend down so often
I wreck my back.

532
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:42,224
And the shampoo is measured out.

533
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,684
Sit down.

534
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:53,610
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

535
00:51:53,694 --> 00:52:04,997
It's all so well organized.
You're very smart, love.

536
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,963
Hello.

537
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,970
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian.

538
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,805
They're in a terrible state.

539
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:31,065
Especially Russians.
There are lots of mafias.

540
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,067
People take advantage ofyou.

541
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,778
Are you getting streaks? Sit down here.

542
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,406
-Wash hair.
-Yes.

543
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,075
She was a hairdresser in Russia.

544
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,659
How do you communicate?

545
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:47,414
She'll speak Spanish in no time.

546
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:52,169
Heavens!

547
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,510
-So, Russian?
-Russia.

548
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,643
The water,

549
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,479
not cold.

550
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,524
Very good.

551
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:33,043
Heythere.

552
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,462
We have a day off tomorrow.

553
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:39,508
Then we'll have one, too.
We need a break.

554
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,052
And we finish up nextweek.

555
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,346
We wanted to have the wrap party here.

556
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:52,187
A buffet would be great.

557
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,232
And we'd like to have the terrace just for us.

558
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,776
That's no problem.

559
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,907
Don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

560
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,826
Same here.

561
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:10,330
All right.

562
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:17,880
lfshe asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

563
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,506
And it's true.

564
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:24,344
And above all don't keep thinking about it.

565
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,109
Hello.

566
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,113
-Are you with someone?
-No.

567
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:47,784
I'm dying to piss.

568
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:54,374
I'll throw some water down,
for Christ's sake! I have to piss.

569
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,545
Hello!

570
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,883
What's wrong with you?

571
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:11,767
-Justthe ends.
-Less than a centimeter.

572
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,901
Tell me,

573
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,238
No.

574
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,114
He said goodbye for good.

575
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:30,410
That's incredible.
ljust don't understand.

576
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,541
It smells of farts!

577
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,424
What?

578
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:51,181
And in those days we didn't have
a bathroom.

579
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,433
We did it in the yard.

580
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:58,689
All day long she'd be in the yard,
with the hens.

581
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,275
Raimunda!

582
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:40,230
It's Mom's.

583
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,940
I knowthat.

584
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,152
And the smell?

585
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,699
In the bathroom and here.

586
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:55,329
Don'tyou smell it?

587
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:01,918
The way she used to fart!

588
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:07,674
And she could never hide it
because she was the firstto laugh!

589
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,139
It's as if I can hear her now.

590
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,768
Don't be silly!

591
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:32,449
You give away dead people's clothes.

592
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,790
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

593
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,557
The antique dolls!

594
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,443
Herjewel case!

595
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,365
Whatwere you going to do with this?

596
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:15,993
Nothing.

597
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,161
You were going to keep it.

598
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,496
Really, Sole.

599
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,583
I didn't bring the case.

600
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,336
Then why is it here?

601
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,591
When I gottoAunt Paula's house...

602
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:33,927
What?

603
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,390
I'd never have believed this.

604
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,937
Stealing the few things she had
before she was even in the grave.

605
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,689
What a nerve!

606
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,819
Don't go off like that!

607
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,353
We have to buy anotherfridge.

608
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,815
Why notfixthe one in the storeroom?

609
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,193
It doesn'twork.

610
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:39,076
I said no one is to go in there,
including you.

611
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,579
The doorwas open, I went in for a hammer.

612
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,498
Has anyone else been in?

613
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,500
I don'tthink so.

614
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,010
I wasn't able to.

615
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,846
You think I like having him in there?

616
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:08,480
Get dressed, everyone will be arriving soon.

617
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:24,412
-I'm not in a party mood.
-Neither am l, but it's work.

618
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:30,210
Come on, pet, I'll help you.

619
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,421
What's wrong?

620
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:38,927
I can't forget about it when he's so near,
in the store room.

621
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:45,350
You don't know what it's like to have
killed your father.

622
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,062
Paco wasn't your father.

623
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:55,610
I know you're doing it for me,
but please don't lie.

624
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,737
I'm not lying.

625
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,823
He recognized you as his daughter,

626
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,409
but he knew he wasn't
your biological father.

627
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,792
Yes.

628
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,420
Butthat doesn't justifywhat he did.

629
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,595
I promise I'll tell you everything
another time.

630
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,140
What's the point ofsitting here?

631
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,309
Who was my father?

632
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,980
Do I know him?

633
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,774
He's dead.

634
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,613
I'll tell you everything.

635
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,780
I swear.

636
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,450
I'll hold you to yourword.

637
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,839
-Two mojitos!
-Coming up!

638
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,967
What about you, love? Another two?

639
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:04,387
With lemon. It's perfect.

640
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:16,066
Isn't Paula looking pretfy?

641
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,364
Here.

642
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,115
Thanks.

643
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,745
How delicious!

644
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,206
I can'ttake any more.
They're really good.

645
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:40,173
this lousy neighborhood.

646
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,385
We'll talk aboutthat.
First, we have to keep this lot happy.

647
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,970
Have a mojito!

648
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:50,600
I'd like to see Raimunda and Paula.

649
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,770
The other day, I only saw their feet.

650
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,480
And look atthe fuss you caused!

651
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,358
Is thatthe restaurant?

652
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,697
She said itwas going well,
but I never imagined this!

653
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,993
She's had a hard time.

654
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,754
Stay in the carand don't let anyone see you.

655
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,548
No one can see me here!

656
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,581
What are you doing here?

657
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,583
This is great!

658
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,670
I've brought you Aunt Paula's things.
I didn't know about the party.

659
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,506
It's a film crew celebrating
the end ofthe shoot.

660
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,675
I've been catering for them.

661
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:09,679
Why did you bother?

662
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,265
I'd never have kept anything of Auntie's,

663
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:13,975
much less hidden itfrom you.

664
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,102
I know that. I'm sorry for what I said.

665
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,605
I always shoot my mouth off.

666
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,856
Hello, Auntie.

667
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,777
-You want anything?
-No.

668
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:48,885
I can see the twinkling ofthe lights
in the distance

669
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,805
That are marking my return

670
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:53,723
Remember?

671
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,518
How could I forget?

672
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:01,564
I've never heard hersing.

673
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,068
Really?

674
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,945
Really, never.

675
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,575
-Would you like to?
-What do you think? Ofcourse!

676
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,332
Come on!

677
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,130
I can't believe it.

678
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,392
Sitthere.

679
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,774
Be quiet!

680
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,235
Sit down! This woman's going to sing!

681
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,324
Good evening.

682
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,286
I'd like to thank the crew

683
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,872
for the work you've given us
these past weeks.

684
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,583
Thankyou so much.

685
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,752
I haven't sung for a very long time,

686
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:07,130
but I'll do ittonight and see how it goes.

687
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:26,274
I'm afraid ofthe encounter

688
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:30,111
With the pastthat's coming back

689
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:33,072
To confront my life

690
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,575
Yourgrandma taught herthat song

691
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:51,674
Butthe fleeing traveler

692
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:55,470
Sooneror later must come to a halt

693
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,182
And even though oblivion
Which destroys everything

694
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:10,109
And that is all of my heart'sfortune

695
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:15,114
Coming back

696
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,786
With a wrinkled forehead

697
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:24,207
Silvering my brow

698
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:28,002
Feeling

699
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:31,547
That life is an instant

700
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,841
That 20 years is nothing

701
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:38,888
Wandering in the shadows
Seekyou and name you

702
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:42,183
Living

703
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,477
With my soul clinging

704
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,354
To a sweet memory

705
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,649
That I weepfor again

706
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:35,945
What kind, and for how long?

707
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,490
The cheapest one you have.
lt's just for one day.

708
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,788
Yes?

709
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,207
Could I speakto Miss Raimunda?

710
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:53,046
Emilio gave me your numberso you could
show me the restaurant.

711
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,382
I'm very keen to see it.
My name is Carlos.

712
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:02,472
you should have called earlier

713
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,266
because a neighbor has taken it over.

714
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:11,397
That's his strategy, just in case.

715
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:17,111
This is her day off, I'm sorry.

716
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:21,157
lfyou call Emilio I'm sure he'll
explain everything.

717
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,411
Goodbye.

718
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,926
-Hello?
-Emilio? It's Raimunda.

719
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:43,179
It's greatto hearyou.
Did a man go to see the restaurant?

720
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,933
Yes, but I didn'ttrust him.
I think he wanted it as a front.

721
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,601
Forwhat?

722
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:59,112
Why on earth did you saythat?

723
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,533
I've been meaning to call you for days.

724
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:07,537
I know it's notthe wayto do things,

725
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:12,291
but I've taken overthe restaurant.

726
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:18,297
I can explain it all to you.

727
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,300
You were out of line, way out of line.

728
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,221
You abused mytrust.

729
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,556
It's no excuse,

730
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,892
butwhen the film crew appeared,
I was desperate.

731
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,812
And now that Paco's left us,
you can imagine...

732
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:40,486
He's gone, and I don'tthink he'll be back.

733
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,531
He left the same day you went to Barcelona.

734
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,491
How are you coping?

735
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:50,371
Clutching at straws.

736
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:54,000
Well, we'll try to sort it out.

737
01:10:54,917 --> 01:11:00,548
but give me a few days.

738
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:28,034
It's Agustina.
I'm in Madrid and I'd like to see you.

739
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:33,915
Tomorrow?

740
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,709
No, the whole week is a real mess.

741
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:41,464
What's wrong?

742
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:45,218
I've got cancer.
The doctorstold me yesterday.

743
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,929
I need to see you.

744
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,640
Tell me what hospital you're in,
I'll come today.

745
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,059
I'm in Central Hospital.

746
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,811
God bless you.

747
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,904
You go up, I'm in a hurry.
Give this to your aunt.

748
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:14,664
-Hello, Auntie.
-What are you doing here?

749
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,752
Is thatyour mothershouting?

750
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,296
Come to the window!

751
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:29,095
But I'm working.

752
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:42,108
I've gotto do a few things,
and then I'll come back.

753
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,776
Give my regards toAgustina.

754
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,613
-Tell heryou saw me!
-Yes, nuisance.

755
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:51,993
Can I come in now?

756
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,121
Yes, love.

757
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,685
How are you?

758
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,858
They opened then closed me up again.

759
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:27,987
-I knew I had something nasfy.
-Don't give up hope.

760
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,532
The flowers are lovely!

761
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:35,620
You shouldn't have bothered.
Leave them there.

762
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:47,006
Whateveryou want.

763
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,924
Close the door.

764
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,180
Get a chair.

765
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:08,402
I won't last very long,

766
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:11,697
but I don'twantto die without knowing
what happened to my mother.

767
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,951
Butwhat can I do?

768
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:19,705
You can tell me ifshe's alive ordead.

769
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,458
Howwill I know?

770
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,460
Askyour mother.

771
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,923
My mother? She's dead!

772
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,551
But she appeared to yourAunt Paula

773
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:41,102
lfshe should appearto you,
ask herabout my mother.

774
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:45,982
Whatyou're asking me is crazy.

775
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:50,277
No.

776
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,488
And you live across the street.

777
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:59,036
But I heard youraunttalking to her
a thousand times.

778
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:04,750
If I hearanything, I'll tell you.

779
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,504
But I think it's unlikely.

780
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,384
You owe me this.

781
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,845
It's all I'm asking.

782
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:22,476
Wait, my sisterwants to see you.
She'll be here any minute.

783
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:31,694
You know she works on WhereverYou Are.

784
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,363
Theywantto surprise her,
and theythought ofyou.

785
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:38,701
You were friends as children,
and you both wentto an audition.

786
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:47,293
from yesterday, from today and for all times.

787
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:54,008
Neither do l.
I'll tell her, but don't forget what I said.

788
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,135
I won't.

789
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:01,474
The Russian loves TV.

790
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:05,061
I don't know ifshe understands,
but she's hypnotized.

791
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,980
There's something abouttrash TV.

792
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:11,192
Once I start watching it, I can't stop.

793
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:15,154
I feel worse and worse, but I'm hooked.

794
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,530
It's like a drug.

795
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,033
I had to stop watching it at night.

796
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:23,704
All that shouting drives you crazy.

797
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:31,045
I like these, they look like they're
from a horror movie.

798
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,255
They're very old.

799
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:38,719
Why didn't mom live with you?

800
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:42,556
We were very short on money.

801
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:49,897
and your motherwentto live
with Aunt Paula.

802
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,733
What has she told you?

803
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:55,111
Nothing, she doesn't like talking about
thattime.

804
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,696
Do you get along well?

805
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,032
It's better now,

806
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,243
but attimes she's really stroppy,
Grandma.

807
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,579
How did you get along with her?

808
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:09,959
When she was little,
she was the apple of my eye,

809
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:16,131
For some reason I didn't know,

810
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,218
she grew awayfrom me

811
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,805
until I lost hercompletely.

812
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,183
Your motherdidn't love me.

813
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:32,439
It really hurts when a daughter doesn't
love her mother.

814
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,151
That's why,

815
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,279
now that it's just the two of you,

816
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:45,244
Why have you come back?

817
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,082
Because I was very lonely.

818
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,171
Good afternoon.

819
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:56,964
Hello.

820
01:17:57,047 --> 01:18:00,009
I need eight meters of plastic clothesline

821
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,011
and some packing tape.

822
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,095
How much tape?

823
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,680
Fourorfive rolls.

824
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,849
Very well.

825
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,934
Five rolls.

826
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:13,981
One...

827
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,191
Two...

828
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:19,612
Very well.

829
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,650
-Great!
-Bye!

830
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,862
How are you, Raimunda?

831
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:04,865
How'sAgustina?

832
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,159
Hi, Mom!

833
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,330
-What's up with you?
-Nothing.

834
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:16,585
Do you mind ifshe stays here tonight?

835
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:21,340
In the spare room.

836
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:27,763
I'd like us to be alone.

837
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,015
All right.

838
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,519
You're sleeping here tonight.

839
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:42,736
I'm off.
I've got a long night ahead of me.

840
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,351
Hello.

841
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,730
I need a favor tonight.

842
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:23,277
No, but I'll payyou, like any client.

843
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,738
No, love, for you a discount,

844
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,241
but I didn't knowyou liked pussy.

845
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:36,623
I'll explain on the way.

846
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,959
First, we have to putthe freezer in the van...

847
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:43,672
We can't carry that on our own!

848
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,799
We'll ask the neighbors to help us.

849
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,093
Put on something comfortable.

850
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,803
Like what?

851
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,597
You look like you're going to explode
in that.

852
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,141
It sticks out here.

853
01:20:55,267 --> 01:21:01,273
-It's slipping!
-No, it's not.

854
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,822
Get it parallel to that.

855
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:12,242
Now, up! One, two, three!

856
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:19,166
Push!

857
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,003
It's in.

858
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:25,798
Bloody hell.

859
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,217
Did you hurt yourself?

860
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,469
Who needs a spleen, anyway?

861
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,848
Where are we going?

862
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,976
To the Jucar River.

863
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,814
180 kilometers away.

864
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:46,068
It'll take us all night
justto go and come back.

865
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,655
Justto go with you?

866
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,825
To come with me to the river, dig a hole,

867
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,202
but the freezer, and not ask questions.

868
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:57,913
Look, I appreciate yourtrust,

869
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:04,753
I have no job, no papers,
I have to work the streets to survive.

870
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,672
Christ, you could have asked me!

871
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,258
I'm asking you now. How much?

872
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,884
You should've asked first.

873
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,639
All right,

874
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,016
give me the nights.

875
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,893
What nights?

876
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:24,940
And I keep what I make from my cocktails.

877
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,775
And you buythe bottles.

878
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,902
All right, partner,

879
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,571
but not a word aboutthis.

880
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:34,700
What can I do? I'm youraccomplice now.

881
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,244
Just so you know, I haven't killed anyone.

882
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,037
Don'ttell me anything.

883
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,039
I wasn't going to.

884
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,830
Get out ofthe way. Give me that.

885
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,057
Oh, my God!

886
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:48,023
Take a break, I'll fill this in.

887
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,213
What are you doing here?

888
01:24:56,008 --> 01:25:02,014
Come in.

889
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,689
-How are you?
-The same.

890
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,692
-Have you found out anything?
-About what?

891
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,485
Aboutwhat I asked you.

892
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,363
I didn'tthinkyou were serious.

893
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,908
May I sit down?

894
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,373
Have pify on me.

895
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,418
I do, all the pifyyou want,

896
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,211
but don't ask crazythings.

897
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,839
All I want is to know ifshe's alive ordead!

898
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:44,306
I understand thatwith the wind
and the cancer

899
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:48,477
butyou can't complicate
other people's lives.

900
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,812
We've got enough on our plates.

901
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,776
The dayyour parents died in the fire,

902
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,028
my motherdisappeared.

903
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:05,077
Don'tyou think that's
a strange coincidence?

904
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,913
No, it'sjust a coincidence.

905
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:14,586
and itwasn'tthe firsttime she disappeared.

906
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,674
Yourgrandmother had to raise you
because she was neverat home.

907
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,509
Don't make me say more.

908
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,428
My mother went off that morning,

909
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:31,186
-No one saw her.
-Ofcourse not.

910
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,563
She made sure ofthat.

911
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,986
My mother was having an affair
with your father.

912
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,823
What are you saying?

913
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:47,994
My motherwould never have allowed it!

914
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,831
That's why she wentto live
with yourAunt Paula.

915
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:53,834
She did that because my auntwasn'twell,

916
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,795
but she never left him.
She went between the two houses.

917
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:01,550
and you hardly had any contact
with your mother for years.

918
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:06,054
Those were herwords.

919
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,142
I've heard a lot ofthings.

920
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,186
Once

921
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:20,068
she didn't care.

922
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:25,741
because he'd been born to hurt
the women who loved him.

923
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,996
What are you getting at?

924
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,583
Thatyour parents' death

925
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,502
and my mother's disappearance
are connected.

926
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:45,427
They ask a lot ofquestions,

927
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,055
and we should wash our dirty linen at home.

928
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:53,852
That's why I won't go on TV even though
my sister is insisting.

929
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,355
You and I have to sort this out.

930
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,527
I have to get back to work.

931
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,033
Think aboutwhat I said.

932
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,410
How's Paco?

933
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,537
What?

934
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,748
He's fine.

935
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:22,881
Shouldn'twe call Auntie
to saywe're coming?

936
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:31,431
It's not politejustto turn up
at someone's house,

937
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:35,227
What's up with you and Sole now?

938
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:43,276
You're so vulgar.

939
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,492
What have you brought, Raimunda?

940
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,661
Food for the three of us.

941
01:28:57,207 --> 01:29:01,461
Why are you shouting?
Are you going deaf?

942
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:03,964
-Yes, I'm deaf.
-Deafas a post.

943
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:07,008
We're staying a while,
I wantyou to cut my hair.

944
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:09,803
Why didn'tyou call? I've got a client.

945
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:16,434
And we have to talk.

946
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:19,145
-Aboutwhat?
-Aunt Paula's house.

947
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:23,024
-May I go and watch TV?
-Yes, go on.

948
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,403
We have to sort out all the papework.

949
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,114
Grandma!

950
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,116
I'm here.

951
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,285
Don't make a sound, my mother's here.

952
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,786
I heard her.

953
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,335
Where's the Russian?

954
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:49,384
I was telling herabout my son being
expelled again.

955
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,304
He slashed the tires ofthe priest
who teaches him religion.

956
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:56,725
with my hair halCwashed.

957
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,184
She must have gone out.

958
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:07,485
and attimes she needs to go outside.

959
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:09,154
Some help she is.

960
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:13,074
No, I took her in.

961
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,494
She eats and sleeps here.
I gave her Mom's clothes.

962
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:19,414
I don't like you taking in
people you don't know.

963
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:22,917
We told herthat.
People take advantage of her.

964
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,254
Look atthe Russian.
She's living in luxury here.

965
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,256
Howwas Paco the other night?

966
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,093
Unpleasant. He came to get his clothes.

967
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:39,476
Why didn'tyou tell me you had a Russian?

968
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,604
I guess I forgot.

969
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:54,491
That'sAgustina!

970
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,785
whereveryou are

971
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,578
Good afternoon, Agustina.

972
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,080
Good afternoon.

973
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,623
We knowfrom yoursister

974
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:09,047
My motherwas a hippie.

975
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,050
That'sAgustina!

976
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,302
She never married.

977
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:18,640
Your mother had a friend

978
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,559
who died the same day she disappeared.

979
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,311
Yes.

980
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:27,649
In a fire.

981
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:30,610
There are lots offires in my village,

982
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:32,487
because ofthe East wind.

983
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:52,924
No, when my motherwasn't well,
as she was a hippie,

984
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,093
she'd leave the village.

985
01:31:55,176 --> 01:32:05,770
We're very interested in that friend
who died

986
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:09,441
the same day your motherdisappeared.
Tell us aboutthat.

987
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,943
About what?

988
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:16,865
We'd like you to tell us about
the woman who died in the fire.

989
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:20,118
-You knowthere are rumors...
-I don't believe in rumors.

990
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,872
I'd like you to explain what you told
our producer.

991
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,958
It was something important
aboutthat woman and her husband

992
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,461
that linked them
to your mother's disappearance.

993
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:30,628
lsthattrue?

994
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,007
I'd rather

995
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,386
nottalk aboutthat.

996
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,056
Those were suppositions of mine.

997
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:46,478
But you're here to talk about
that woman and your mother.

998
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,563
I've changed my mind.

999
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:56,905
I'd like to explain

1000
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,532
thatAgustina is also here to tell us

1001
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,826
that she's got a terminal illness.

1002
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:06,039
Agustina has got cancer.

1003
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,836
You've got cancer.

1004
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:17,425
A big hand for Agustina!

1005
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:33,441
Butto go to Houston,
you have to speak out.

1006
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:36,694
Remember, you made a commitment
to this channel.

1007
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,599
Agustina came to see me.

1008
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:08,476
She did?

1009
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,645
She insists that Mom appears to us.

1010
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,730
She wants me to ask herabout her mother.

1011
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:16,151
She also said thatwhen she disappeared,

1012
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,194
her mother was having an affair with Dad.

1013
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:27,370
Do you know anything aboutthat?

1014
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,664
No.

1015
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:34,961
Well, Mom told me, after...

1016
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,506
After what?

1017
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,301
After she found out.

1018
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:46,139
Look at me.

1019
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:54,188
Oodles.

1020
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,774
But if I tell you,

1021
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,277
you'll be annoyed oryou won't believe me.

1022
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:03,281
I promise I'll believe you
and I won't be annoyed.

1023
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:07,285
Mom's been appearing all the time.

1024
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,955
To whom?

1025
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:12,290
Sit down.

1026
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,506
She was with Aunt Paula until she died.

1027
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:25,887
and opened the doorso she could find
the body.

1028
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:28,056
She put outthe money
so they'd bring her bread

1029
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:34,479
Yeah.

1030
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,482
Did Agustina tell you all that?

1031
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,526
You don't believe me.

1032
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:50,536
you said yourself itwas incredible

1033
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:54,499
that she could live like that,
with her mind gone and halCblind.

1034
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,334
Remember?

1035
01:35:56,417 --> 01:36:01,589
That she wasn't alone.

1036
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:06,219
Who do you think made the wafers
and putt hem in tupperwares,

1037
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,888
one for each of us?

1038
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:11,766
Who do you think took the dolls
and Auntie's valuables

1039
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:14,102
before the neighbors swiped everything?

1040
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,312
Now do you understand?

1041
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,235
Have you seen her?

1042
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,028
Yes.

1043
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:30,702
Is she, by any chance,

1044
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,706
Yes.

1045
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:37,500
Where is she?

1046
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,046
In there.

1047
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,827
Mom!

1048
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,746
What are you doing down there?

1049
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:40,188
Weren'tyou dead?

1050
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:44,358
I've come back to ask you to forgive me.

1051
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:48,029
I knew nothing about it.

1052
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:50,073
I nevereven imagined it.

1053
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:56,412
Come on, Paula!

1054
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,012
My little girl!

1055
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:20,853
She's seen me,

1056
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,231
and she didn't reject me, did she?

1057
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:24,482
No.

1058
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,611
Did you really come back
to ask herto forgive you?

1059
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:32,240
And also to be with you.

1060
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:36,160
Somedayyou can explain it all to me.

1061
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:41,916
Yes, and that day I hope you understand me

1062
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,876
and that you forgive me, too.

1063
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:15,616
Why don'twe go back?

1064
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,246
Now?

1065
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:21,622
Sure.

1066
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:52,570
-I've dreamt about this so often.
-So have l.

1067
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,157
I don't knowwhere to begin.

1068
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:02,955
No, love, I'm not.

1069
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:08,127
But even if I had died,

1070
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:13,216
·or not seeing what was going on.

1071
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:15,760
I was blind.

1072
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:20,014
I found out the day of the fire.

1073
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:22,099
Had you really left Dad?

1074
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:26,437
I couldn't stand his cheating.

1075
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:32,318
you rang and spoke toAuntie.

1076
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:35,613
As usual, you didn't ask for me.

1077
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:39,951
I got anger and told your aunt
you were heartless.

1078
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:43,287
As I kept badmouthing you,

1079
01:40:43,829 --> 01:40:45,873
youraunt

1080
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:47,792
defended you

1081
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,962
and told me everything.

1082
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,845
That your father had abused you,

1083
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:03,516
thatyou'd gotten pregnant,

1084
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,518
and that Paula

1085
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:07,478
is yourdaughter

1086
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,397
and yoursister.

1087
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,401
I couldn't believe it.

1088
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:17,697
How could such a monstrous thing happen
in front of me

1089
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,657
without me realizing it?

1090
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,079
Then, I understood everything.

1091
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:28,249
I understood yoursilence

1092
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,625
and whyyou grew so distant.

1093
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:39,677
He couldn't cope
with the shame of what he'd done.

1094
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,846
I understood

1095
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:46,309
you wentto Madrid

1096
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:49,562
and wanted nothing to do with us.

1097
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:58,612
When I found out,

1098
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:01,949
I was like a wild thing.

1099
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:05,244
I wentto the hut,
readyto scratch his eyes out!

1100
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:08,372
I found him asleep with Agustina's mother,

1101
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:10,541
both ofthem worn out.

1102
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:15,755
I setfire to the hut.

1103
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:21,218
and in no time
the flames had devoured everything.

1104
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:24,347
They didn't have time to wake up.

1105
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,933
The ashes in yourgrave

1106
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:30,561
are those of Agustina's mother?

1107
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:32,730
Yes.

1108
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:43,657
I wandered the countryside for a few days,

1109
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:48,162
like an animal.

1110
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:51,791
butfirst

1111
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,877
I wentto Paula's house to see her.

1112
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:58,631
She was in a terrible state.

1113
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:01,133
When she saw me,

1114
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:12,520
She greeted me as if I hadjust gone
outthe door.

1115
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:26,951
until she died.

1116
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:33,999
In the village theythinkyou're a ghost.

1117
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:37,128
That's the good thing
about such superstitious places.

1118
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:40,840
lt was easier for me to go along with them

1119
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:42,508
than to speak the truth.

1120
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:45,553
I thought I'd be arrested.

1121
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:57,815
I swear I've been in a living purgatory.

1122
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:04,572
Never bettersaid.

1123
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:31,599
Why don'twe drive bythe river?

1124
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:36,353
It's not what it was. It's dry.

1125
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:38,063
How do you know?

1126
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:43,778
Don'tyou know?

1127
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:08,969
Yes.

1128
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:11,764
There was more waterthen.

1129
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:15,810
Shall we eat something?

1130
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:17,937
Not for me.

1131
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,689
-I'm going to eat a wafer.
-Me too.

1132
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:33,410
This was your father's favorite place.

1133
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,996
Paco's?

1134
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,665
Yes.

1135
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,127
ltwas the onlything he missed.

1136
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:43,420
This river.

1137
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,110
I'm glad he's resting here.

1138
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,249
Come on. Nobody'll see you now.

1139
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:45,316
she'd be so happy.

1140
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,450
Have you always had such a big chest?

1141
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,703
Yes, since I was little.

1142
01:46:57,786 --> 01:47:00,497
I remembered you having less.

1143
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:07,254
All right.

1144
01:47:07,338 --> 01:47:13,927
It's good for blood pressure and the heart.

1145
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:16,013
What did Aunt Paula say?

1146
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,683
She roared laughing.

1147
01:47:21,977 --> 01:47:23,062
Bye.

1148
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:27,942
lt'sAunt Paula...

1149
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:29,693
Don't start.

1150
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:31,987
I'll get it.

1151
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,157
Hide Mom's plate and cutlery.

1152
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:44,083
-Who is it?
-Agustina.

1153
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,713
We're having supper. We'vejust arrived.

1154
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:51,423
I'm sorry to bother you.

1155
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:54,218
Don't stay outthere.

1156
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:55,928
Thankyou.

1157
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,393
Good evening.

1158
01:48:03,852 --> 01:48:06,355
-Sit down.
-Thankyou.

1159
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,657
I came to apologize aboutthe show.

1160
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:21,078
I knowthat.

1161
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,080
It's no excuse,

1162
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:27,584
They cure everything there.

1163
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:29,002
But I couldn't do it.

1164
01:48:29,086 --> 01:48:35,592
and able to lookyou in the eye.

1165
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:41,473
-Mom, I'm going to bed, all right?
-Yes, go on.

1166
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:49,606
I heard you're going to sell the house.

1167
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:52,943
We'd thought about it, but nowwe're here...

1168
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:55,612
There are so many memories.

1169
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:59,158
Well, I have to go.

1170
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:11,211
but it gives me the creeps.

1171
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:15,299
You rsister is unforgivable.
Leaving you alone like this.

1172
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,176
Don't even mention her.

1173
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:20,554
As I didn't saywhattheywanted
on television,

1174
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:26,018
She's very angry with me.
But I'm even angrie rwith her.

1175
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:28,020
With good reason.

1176
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:30,105
I envy you two.

1177
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:33,192
You're so close.

1178
01:49:53,045 --> 01:49:55,339
lrene!

1179
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:58,425
I've longed to see you.

1180
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:02,513
I heard aboutyour problem,

1181
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,724
and I can imagine how lonelyyou are.

1182
01:50:05,808 --> 01:50:07,684
Very lonely.

1183
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:16,235
I'm here to look after you.

1184
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:20,948
Don't worry, I closed it.

1185
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:28,789
Tomorrowyou'll be in a lot of pain.

1186
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:31,708
Have you gotthe medicine and the needles?

1187
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:36,004
Good, I'll give you the injection.

1188
01:50:41,844 --> 01:50:43,971
I was born in this bed.

1189
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,891
My motherslept here.

1190
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:52,229
And in this bed
we held yoursister Paula's wake.

1191
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:54,439
I know,

1192
01:50:54,523 --> 01:50:56,608
and I'm so grateful.

1193
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:08,579
But don'ttell anyone I've come back.

1194
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,331
Don't worry.

1195
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:15,669
Thank you for not talking about me
on television.

1196
01:51:17,129 --> 01:51:19,756
It's ourown business.

1197
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:24,303
and no one else's.

1198
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:35,165
Mom, it's me, let me in!

1199
01:52:37,042 --> 01:52:39,628
What are you doing here? Come in.

1200
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,172
I missed you.

1201
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:52,849
the least I can do is look after her
until she dies.

1202
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:59,398
I haven'ttold you about Paco
orwhat I've done.

1203
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,901
I'm dying to hear everything,
but go away now.

1204
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:07,823
Yes.

1205
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:12,661
I need you, Mom.

1206
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:18,417
I don't know how I lived all these years
withoutyou.

1207
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,460
Don't saythat.

1208
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:23,046
I'll start to cry,

1209
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:25,382
and ghosts don't cry.
