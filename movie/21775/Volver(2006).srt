1
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:12,559
Put some stones in the vase
or it'll fall over.

2
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:20,925
This bloody wind!

3
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:23,072
Polish the letters well.

4
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:26,171
There are so many widows!

5
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,173
The women here
live longer than the men.

6
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,277
- Except poor Mom.
- Mom was lucky.

7
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,039
Raimunda, don't say that!

8
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,342
She died in dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

9
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,780
Burned to death!

10
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,247
That's the worst way to die.

11
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:43,789
They were asleep.

12
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:45,316
They didn't even realize.

13
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:48,362
Even so, how can you say
something like that!

14
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,570
Hello.

15
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:59,808
- Is that everything, Mom?
- I'll get the rest.

16
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,435
This is wonderful!

17
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:02,737
Good Lord!

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,507
- Is this Paula?
- Of course.

19
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:06,841
She's all grown up!

20
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,142
Give her a kiss.

21
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,946
She's got your father's eyes.

22
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:14,615
- How are you?
- Not good.

23
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:15,917
Don't say that.

24
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:19,655
I want to give my grave the once- over.

25
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,192
With this wind, you can't keep it clean.

26
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:25,198
- It looks lovely.
- Cleaning it relaxes me.

27
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,595
I often come and sit here on my own,
and time goes by.

28
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,734
We're going now,
we have to see Aunt Paula.

29
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,800
- Come and see me afterwards.
- Sure.

30
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:37,241
How's Paco?

31
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:40,147
He's fine, he stayed
in Madrid, working.

32
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:43,717
Mom,

33
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,755
does Agustina really come
and clean her own grave?

34
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,548
Yes, it's the custom here.

35
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,427
They buy a plot
and look after it all their lives,

36
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:52,686
like a second home.

37
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,757
- That freaks me out!
- It's tradition here.

38
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,401
- Shall I drive?
- Yes.

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,988
Aunt Paula!

40
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:26,992
Who is it?

41
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:28,129
Raimunda!

42
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,891
- Don't take all day.
- Don't rush me.

43
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:32,659
I don't like going back
in the dark.

44
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,233
Be nice to Auntie, don't laugh at her.

45
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:37,872
- All right.
- This house still smells of Mom.

46
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,774
How are you, Aunt?

47
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:44,480
You're very thin!
Have you had the baby?

48
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,775
- Fourteen years ago.
- Doesn't time fly!

49
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:48,882
And who are these?

50
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:51,645
Who do you think?
Sole and my Paula!

51
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:52,980
The same name as me!

52
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:56,418
And Sole.

53
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,320
Shall we go into the dining room?

54
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,795
That Sole looks like a right sourpuss.

55
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,299
For Heaven's sake!

56
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:13,799
...the wind carried
the cinders to the bushes.

57
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,306
The result is the most tragic fire
in the last 13 years.

58
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:21,543
- Mind if I turn it off?
- No, I can't see it anyway.

59
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:24,777
Fires are dreadful.

60
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:26,916
That's how your grandparents died.

61
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:29,987
- Why did I come in here?
- I don't know.

62
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,851
To talk?

63
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,260
- To get some food?
- Yes!

64
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:36,996
Look in the sideboard.

65
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,733
I'm very shaky on my pins.

66
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,304
Look, wafers!

67
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:45,504
Just like mom's.
Eat up.

68
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,338
How was the cemetery?

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,877
Your mother is delighted.

70
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,643
Did you scrub the headstone properly?

71
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:56,045
Of course.

72
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:58,281
She likes it to be clean.

73
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:00,718
If she could, she'd clean it herself.

74
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,482
But, of course, she can't.

75
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:06,118
Of course, she can't.

76
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,325
Don't you feel lonely
in this big house?

77
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:14,495
You'd be better off in a home,
where you'd be looked after.

78
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,632
I'm fine as I am.

79
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,474
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Well, go!

80
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,108
You can't live on your own.
I'm worried about you.

81
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,143
How do you manage your meals?

82
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:28,043
Very well.

83
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:31,516
Agustina brings me bread,
your mother does the cooking

84
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:35,088
and if I need anything
I call the store and they bring it...

85
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,425
I'm fine.

86
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,030
What a lovely touch!

87
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,640
Look!

88
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:29,775
It's got your name on it.

89
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,473
Shall we go?

90
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:35,515
Yes.

91
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,213
We're leaving now.

92
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,355
I'm so shaky on my pins.

93
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,788
- Don't get up.
- How could I not get up?

94
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:49,598
Next time I come back,
I'm taking you home with me.

95
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,560
Yes, next time.

96
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:54,129
What matters is that you come back.

97
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:56,465
You've gotten very wobbly.

98
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,194
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

99
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,365
Mind how you go!

100
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:30,004
We'll do that. I love you lots!

101
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,539
- Shall we go to Agustina's?
- Yes.

102
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:44,650
Come in!

103
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:48,451
Well?

104
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,185
- How did you find your aunt?
- Bad.

105
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,325
Terrible.

106
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,827
She's gotten very shaky.
I don't know how she copes.

107
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,192
He does very well
without going outside.

108
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,458
She eats a stick of bread every day.
She leaves the money for me.

109
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,396
Let's go onto the patio.

110
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,965
She's in an awful state, love.

111
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:05,198
She doesn't know what year it is.

112
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:10,242
She talks about mom
as if she were still alive.

113
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,509
For her, she isn't dead.

114
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,546
She can't accept it.

115
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,584
Sit down for a while.

116
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:20,487
I'd like to pay you something
to look in on her every day.

117
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,817
I won't accept anything!
I'm very happy to do it.

118
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:26,721
I'd take her home,

119
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,057
but I'd have to throw
my husband out to make room.

120
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,629
But we have to do something.

121
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,700
Every morning, before I go shopping,
I tap on her window

122
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,531
and I don't move until she answers me.

123
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,001
I keep an eye on her.

124
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,506
I really appreciate that.

125
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,877
I like to think...

126
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,407
someone's doing that for my mother,

127
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,311
wherever she is.

128
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:59,553
Look! Wasn't she cutting edge then?

129
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,723
The only hippie in the village.

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,095
Look at her plastic jewelry.

131
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:11,500
- They're awesome!
- First- rate plastic.

132
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:18,639
Every time I smoke a joint
I think of her.

133
00:09:18,848 --> 00:09:20,907
That's a fine example
you're setting for Paula!

134
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,479
- There's still no news?
- Nothing.

135
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,884
It's like the earth swallowed her up.

136
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,653
- And your sister Brigida?
- Her?

137
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:32,326
She's in Madrid,
she's a big hit on trash TV.

138
00:09:35,798 --> 00:09:37,527
Mom, I'm out of credit!

139
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,501
Good, we'll get a break
from the telephone.

140
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,136
- You can use mine.
- She'll bankrupt you.

141
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,465
In that case, no.

142
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:48,199
As I was saying,
Brigida is on so many shows

143
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,106
she can put a deposit
on an apartment in Madrid.

144
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:51,712
And she's going to make a record.

145
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:55,146
- She always liked singing.
- So did this one.

146
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:57,385
Remember when you and she,

147
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,449
you must've been thirteen,

148
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,521
went to an audition for child singers?

149
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,783
Hey, you never told me that!

150
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:07,396
It was your granny's idea.
She was up for anything.

151
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:10,923
Talking of mothers,
maybe yours hasn't shown up

152
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:12,624
so as not to ruin
your sister's career.

153
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:16,130
Mom would love to be on television.

154
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,869
She'd go crazy.

155
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,237
Want some?

156
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:25,740
I grow it myself. Look at the plants.

157
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,749
We have to leave.

158
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:33,687
Did you report her disappearance
to the police?

159
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,220
Brigida thinks it isn't necessary.

160
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:38,155
She's said it so often on TV.

161
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:42,492
Yes, but you have to report it
to the police, not say it on TV.

162
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,527
I don't know.

163
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,567
In any case, it's not
the first time she's left home.

164
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:51,899
But never for so long.

165
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:53,966
It's been over three years.

166
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:55,877
Don't give up hope.

167
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,511
And take care of yourself,
you don't look well.

168
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,210
Your oleander looks wonderful.

169
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:04,682
Yes, it didn't get aphids this year.
But I've really lost my appetite.

170
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:06,352
Maybe it's the joints.

171
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:09,855
No, if it weren't for them,
I wouldn't eat at all.

172
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:14,661
Your father's eyes.

173
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,759
A joint makes me feel a bit hungry
and it relaxes me.

174
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:27,703
Safe journey!

175
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,491
Guess what I saw upstairs
beside the bathroom!

176
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:46,259
What?

177
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,563
- An exercise bike.
- That freaks me out!

178
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,735
Why would auntie want a bike
if she can't walk?

179
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,364
Exactly, she's lost her mind.

180
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,905
Don't talk like that about her.

181
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,539
She didn't even recognize us.

182
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,372
It's the wind.

183
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,614
That goddamn East wind here
drives people crazy!

184
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,877
The wafers are delicious.

185
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:15,447
How can she bake those
when she's as blind as a bat?

186
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,308
Hello, Regina.

187
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,184
- Going to work?
- Got no choice, love.

188
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,386
- Why not give her a lift?
- Where are you going?

189
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:51,786
To the club. If you drop me
in the center that'd be great.

190
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:53,552
- All right.
- Thanks.

191
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,988
See you later.

192
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,012
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

193
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:14,238
Hello.

194
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:22,956
Well?

195
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,251
Did you have fun?

196
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:28,489
In the cemetery?
You kidding me?

197
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:35,762
- Were you having a party?
- Me? What do you mean?

198
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,700
Paula, sit properly. Close your legs!

199
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,439
Will you bring me another beer?

200
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,672
Are you kidding?

201
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,341
Go on, please.

202
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:53,854
Haven't you had enough?
You have to work tomorrow.

203
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm free tomorrow, and the day after too.

204
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:00,295
How come?

205
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:03,324
I was fired.

206
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,992
Hang on.

207
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:07,734
Christ Almighty!

208
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:12,032
I'll get ajob on Sundays,
it's my only free day.

209
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:17,273
I'll get ajob, but let me
watch the game in peace.

210
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:22,718
You can forget about soccer.
There'll be no more cable.

211
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,781
We're a poor family
and we'll live like one.

212
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,089
Paula, put that phone down!

213
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,853
Your supper's here if you want it.

214
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:05,018
Are you angry?

215
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:09,123
I'm worried about my aunt.

216
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,466
She's worse than ever.

217
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,668
She didn't even recognize
Paula and Sole.

218
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:21,310
- I don't know how she manages.
- But she does.

219
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:25,544
Leave me be.

220
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:29,908
What's wrong?

221
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,449
I'm worn out and I have to get up early.

222
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,520
I'll do the work.

223
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,017
Don't be a pest!

224
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:50,361
Don't call me a pest.

225
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,332
Sorry.

226
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:18,617
What are you doing here?

227
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,590
- Waiting for you.
- What for?

228
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:27,235
I called you loads of times
to tell you to buy bread.

229
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:29,868
I don't suppose you
thought to buy any.

230
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:34,866
You're soaked.
How long have you been here?

231
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,510
A while.

232
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,917
Where were you? With your pals?

233
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:46,313
I wasn't anywhere.

234
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,785
Why didn't you answer the phone?

235
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:53,419
What's wrong?

236
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,294
Is something wrong?

237
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:03,935
Tell me, what's happened?

238
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,311
Where's your father?

239
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:17,248
He's...

240
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:19,348
Where?

241
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:22,620
In the kitchen.

242
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:34,933
What happened?

243
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,875
I was in the kitchen,
with my back to him

244
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,974
and suddenly dad jumped on me.

245
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:46,572
He was drunk.

246
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:50,844
I asked him what he was doing
and he said he wasn't my father.

247
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,485
I pushed him away.

248
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,085
But he got up
and put his arms around me.

249
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:03,858
I pushed him again.

250
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:12,301
He unzipped his pants.

251
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,566
He kept saying that it wasn't wrong

252
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:17,205
and that he wasn't my father!

253
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,385
I took a knife from the drawer

254
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:26,214
and I threatened him

255
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,853
but it was only to scare him.

256
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:34,827
He didn't believe me.

257
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,861
He said I wouldn't dare

258
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:42,927
and he jumped on me.

259
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:51,543
What are you going to do?

260
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,311
I don't know.

261
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,923
Go and change, or you'll get pneumonia.

262
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,759
Remember, I killed him

263
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:14,902
and you saw nothing, you weren't here.

264
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:18,965
It's very important you remember that.

265
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:06,815
Don't open!

266
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,241
Who can it be?

267
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:09,584
I don't know.

268
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:11,119
Go to your room.

269
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:15,213
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

270
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:19,187
Coming!

271
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:27,959
Hi there.

272
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,296
I'm sorry, I know it's late,
but I'm going to Barcelona tomorrow.

273
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:35,136
I want to give you the restaurant keys
in case anyone comes to see it.

274
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,307
I don't mind, It's just I'm never at home.

275
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:41,675
What about Paco? He's always here.

276
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,277
Paco...

277
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:48,018
He finally got a job.
He's starting tomorrow.

278
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:49,782
Are you hurt?

279
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,392
Women's troubles.

280
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:55,229
But now that I think about it,

281
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:58,364
with Paco working
I'll have more free time.

282
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:02,562
- Give me the keys, I'll sort it out.
- Here.

283
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:04,602
This is my brother's home number.

284
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:06,365
The other is my cell phone.

285
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,544
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- In the morning.

286
00:23:12,314 --> 00:23:16,444
Tell me, how much are you asking?
I always liked your restaurant.

287
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:18,880
It's a pity you didn't like
the owner too.

288
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,683
Emilio, please...

289
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:23,915
For the lease, five million,
but it's negotiable.

290
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,190
We'll miss you.

291
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:29,921
And I'll miss you girls.

292
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:35,560
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

293
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:41,765
- Is Emilio leaving?
- Yes.

294
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:46,604
- Go back to your room.
- I want to be with you.

295
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:53,954
You'll have to help me later.

296
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,020
Don't answer!

297
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,488
It'll be one of your pals.

298
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,660
Answer it, tell them you can't talk.

299
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:11,437
This is no time to be calling.

300
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,270
I can't talk...

301
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:18,946
What do you mean? It's your Aunt Sole.

302
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:20,875
Put your mother on.

303
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,344
It's Aunt Sole.

304
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,146
Tell her I'm busy.

305
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:27,211
She's busy now.

306
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,253
Put her on, it's important.

307
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:31,582
Take the phone, Mom.

308
00:24:35,597 --> 00:24:38,191
Sole, I've got a pile of ironing

309
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,231
and I was out working all afternoon.

310
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:41,663
Agustina rang.

311
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:44,762
Aunt Paula is dead.

312
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:47,604
- When?
- A little while ago.

313
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:53,344
Aunt Paula is dead.

314
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:59,884
Just a minute ago I was thinking
of bringing her here.

315
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:03,753
She died all alone!

316
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,324
Don't cry, pet.

317
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:09,321
Listen, Agustina said
we're not to worry.

318
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:12,295
She and Squinty will lay her out
before we get there.

319
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,765
Auntie had everything organized.

320
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,939
She even chose her coffin
and paid for everything.

321
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:22,168
It's incredible that
she was so lucid at the end.

322
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:24,576
I can't go to the funeral.

323
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,342
I'm truly sorry,

324
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:28,581
but I'm very busy.

325
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:31,412
How can you not go!
What will people say!

326
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,611
I can't go, not remotely.

327
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:37,252
You have to go on your own.

328
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:38,551
On my own?

329
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,888
No way. You know
I'm terrified of the dead.

330
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:44,995
But you needn't see Auntie.

331
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,291
I'll tell Agustina to make sure of that.

332
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:48,799
And if they ask for you?

333
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:52,469
Say I've had a gallbladder
operation... anything.

334
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:56,209
I'll go later, but today
it's not remotely possible.

335
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:00,014
I don't understand you.
Auntie loved you so much.

336
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:01,641
And I loved her.

337
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:06,985
I'll explain it to you some day,
and that day, you'll flip.

338
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:08,554
I'm flipping now.

339
00:26:08,857 --> 00:26:11,883
Take a tranquilizer,
I'm going to take one too.

340
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:14,186
And you go tomorrow morning.

341
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:16,627
All right?

342
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:17,958
I guess...

343
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:39,485
The door!

344
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:01,839
Wait!

345
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:10,639
You stay here.
Stay here and keep watch.

346
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:15,211
I hope it hasn't changed
since I worked here.

347
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:22,148
DEEP FREEZE

348
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:04,525
Stay where you are!

349
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:06,419
Sorry.

350
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:09,163
What do you want?

351
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,263
Is the restaurant open?

352
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:14,794
Why?

353
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:16,866
Give me a hand.

354
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:21,799
We're shooting a film in the area

355
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:25,307
and I'm looking for somewhere
we can all eat.

356
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,111
Do you know
any restaurants around here?

357
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:32,750
How many are you?

358
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,218
25 and 5... 30.

359
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:39,183
Come on, help me.

360
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:45,099
I can do it for you, if you want.
We were going to close today.

361
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,191
So, lunch for thirty.

362
00:30:49,504 --> 00:30:50,596
At what time?

363
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:54,299
We stop at 3:30, and we're very close.

364
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:56,909
- Around 4:00?
- Yeah.

365
00:30:59,514 --> 00:31:01,744
And, tell me, how much?

366
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,410
Ten euros a head.

367
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:05,475
That's fine.

368
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:11,754
I'm sorry I shouted at you,
but you scared me.

369
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:16,463
- Well, I'll see you at 4:00.
- Sure.

370
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,064
Thanks a lot.

371
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:21,596
It's 10:00!

372
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:29,439
- Two kilos.
- Give me another two kilos.

373
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:33,403
How much are the potatoes?

374
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:35,776
1.60 for four kilos.

375
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:38,749
- Give me eight kilos.
- Sure.

376
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,048
Hello, Regina.

377
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,692
Hello, you're carting quite a load!

378
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,726
I have to make lunch for 30.

379
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:53,362
- Could you lend me 100 euros?
- I'm broke, love.

380
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:55,433
I've just bought
a chunk of pork this big.

381
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:58,071
I could use that. I'll buy it from you.

382
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,267
It cost me 10.80, It's all I have!

383
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:02,636
I'll pay you tomorrow. Come on!

384
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:04,702
I'll bring it over to you now.

385
00:32:04,913 --> 00:32:06,813
- Thanks, love.
- I'll have to diet today.

386
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:08,414
It'll do you good.

387
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,914
Hey, Ines! Back from the village?

388
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,952
I got here yesterday. How are you?

389
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,094
Did you happen to bring
any sausages or chorizo?

390
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:23,757
I certainly did! The sausages are great.

391
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,957
My mother-in-law orders them
specially for me.

392
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:29,500
- I need a kilo or so.
- Why's that?

393
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:32,298
- I have to cook for 30.
- Who's coming?

394
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:34,134
I'll tell you later.

395
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,567
Can I buy them? I'll pay you tomorrow.

396
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:39,473
- Sure, it's no problem.
- Thanks.

397
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,945
Did you bring anything sweet?

398
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:45,245
I brought some cookies
that melt in your mouth.

399
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:48,081
With the way your glucose
and cholesterol are,

400
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,087
I can't believe you brought cookies.

401
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:53,318
It's my only vice. Three boxes.

402
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,823
You shouldn't eat them.

403
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,090
- What do I do, give them away?
- Sell them to me.

404
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,234
At least let me taste them.

405
00:33:00,435 --> 00:33:03,996
You can eat three or four
but don't stuff yourself.

406
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:07,071
- Bring them round to me, love.
- I'll do that.

407
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:07,764
Thanks.

408
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:09,443
Bye, pet.

409
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:26,059
Who'd like some pork? It's delicious.

410
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,888
You too?

411
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,136
Some pork? It's delicious.

412
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:21,176
Agustina?

413
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:27,688
Is that you?

414
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,492
Soledad,

415
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,193
daughter.

416
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:42,191
Sole,

417
00:34:42,937 --> 00:34:44,598
I have to talk to you.

418
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,053
Sole!

419
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:16,436
There, there.

420
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:17,931
Take it easy.

421
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:22,403
Where is she?

422
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:25,012
Upstairs, in my mother's room,

423
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:26,975
the best room in the house.

424
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,544
I brought her here
to give her a better wake.

425
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,619
Thank you so much.

426
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:37,724
Come on, we're the principal mourners.

427
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:45,123
Good afternoon.

428
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:50,434
I spoke to your sister.
She's just had an operation.

429
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:52,267
Yes, what timing.

430
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:54,732
She said you're not to see the body.

431
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:57,740
Don't worry, you won't have to.

432
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,392
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

433
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:25,864
We'll let her rest a while,
she's very tired.

434
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:28,036
Come on.

435
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,537
Over here.

436
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:37,915
It was late at night.

437
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,648
I'd had supper and I was
watching the television.

438
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:46,392
I heard someone knocking at my door.

439
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:51,257
I wasn't sure, but just then

440
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,830
I heard the same noise,

441
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:56,734
and I asked, "Who is it?"

442
00:36:58,172 --> 00:36:59,799
And a voice answered,

443
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,407
"Agustina".

444
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:05,744
I wasn't afraid.

445
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:09,345
I went outside but I saw no one.

446
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,176
I looked over at your aunt's house

447
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:14,355
and the door seemed to be open.

448
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:16,690
I thought it was odd,

449
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:19,090
so I went in.

450
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,658
I called your aunt

451
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:24,154
but she didn't answer me.

452
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,158
How could she answer me, poor thing?

453
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,635
I went into her room

454
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,399
and I found her there, in bed,

455
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:36,705
as still as a little bird!

456
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:39,777
It was her spirit that warned you.

457
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:42,775
But was it Paula's spirit
or the other one's?

458
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:44,348
One of the two.

459
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,882
I can't say who it was, I didn't see.

460
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:50,254
But just as I'm listening to you now,

461
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:54,627
someone or something
warned me that Paula had died,

462
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:57,726
and opened the door so I could go in.

463
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:00,729
Come into the kitchen.

464
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,373
I bet you haven't eaten yet.

465
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,668
No.

466
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,411
Not since last night, but I'm all right.

467
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:17,910
I thought as much.

468
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:20,951
This'll do you good.

469
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:23,988
Don't give me any more! That's enough.

470
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:33,392
What did the women mean?

471
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:36,769
It was just talk.

472
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,663
You know what villages are like.

473
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,901
They were talking about my mother.

474
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:43,043
Some people say they've seen her.

475
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:48,410
They say she came back
to look after your Aunt Paula.

476
00:38:50,718 --> 00:38:52,447
Has she not appeared to you?

477
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:54,778
No. What about you?

478
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:57,548
No, but those things happen.

479
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,952
I know.

480
00:38:59,761 --> 00:39:02,924
My grandfather, God rest him,
appeared to my grandmother.

481
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:05,626
At first she was frightened.

482
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:07,558
Eat up!

483
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,300
Then she asked him what he wanted

484
00:39:11,673 --> 00:39:13,163
and his spirit told her

485
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:16,136
there was a promise
he hadn't fulfilled.

486
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,569
She carried it out

487
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,574
and the whole village
went with her to the cemetery

488
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:23,944
where they left my grandfather
so he'd rest in peace.

489
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:25,847
And he never appeared again.

490
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:33,550
That isn't just a story I heard.

491
00:39:34,362 --> 00:39:35,488
I lived it.

492
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:11,927
Do you want to go
into your aunt's house

493
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:13,528
in case you want to take anything?

494
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:15,729
No, Raimunda will come later.

495
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:19,464
Tell her it went very well
and the whole village came.

496
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:21,864
I'll do that.

497
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:25,205
I'm going to miss her so much!

498
00:40:30,418 --> 00:40:31,407
Go on.

499
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,716
Let me out, Sole!

500
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:44,421
Let me out! I'm your mother.

501
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:46,056
I won't do anything to you.

502
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:55,896
My mother is dead.

503
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:02,035
If you're anything,
you're her ghost or her spirit.

504
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:04,211
Whatever you say,
but get me out of here.

505
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,442
I'm in the trunk of your car.

506
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:11,441
Really, mom, the things you do!

507
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:22,822
Soledad,

508
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,757
daughter,

509
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:27,223
don't be afraid of me.

510
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:29,633
I'm your mother.

511
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,298
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

512
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,584
Now, give me a hand.

513
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:49,320
Take this.

514
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:55,459
- Auntie's suitcase!
- Yes.

515
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:01,658
What is all this?

516
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:04,565
Clothes, and some valuables Auntie had.

517
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:07,238
A good thing I hid them
before the neighbors arrived.

518
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:10,567
Except for Agustina,
they all went through everything,

519
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:12,268
but I'd got there first.

520
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,676
You'll have to give Agustina a gift,
she's been so good.

521
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:17,514
Better than your sister.

522
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:20,379
There was such a fuss
when she didn't turn up.

523
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:23,220
If you'd heard
what Squinty said about her!

524
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:25,790
Thank heavens you came.

525
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:29,386
I'm wrecked after the trip.

526
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:36,737
- Are you sleeping here?
- Yes, where do you want me to go?

527
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:40,863
What a sight!
I'm not surprised I scared you.

528
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:43,707
Do you still have the illegal hair salon?

529
00:43:43,978 --> 00:43:45,309
That's how I make my living.

530
00:43:46,414 --> 00:43:49,212
- Is that the guest room?
- Yes, that's it.

531
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,114
Tomorrow, you can give me
a color and a trim.

532
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,847
And I need dark glasses too.

533
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:57,280
I don't want to be
stuck in the house all day.

534
00:43:57,725 --> 00:43:59,056
I have to go out.

535
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:01,261
Nobody knows me here.

536
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:04,494
In the village, I couldn't
even go to the front door.

537
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,531
I need a bit of air.

538
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:11,798
Are you staying for long?

539
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:16,410
- You want to throw me out already?
- No, I'm just asking.

540
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:21,047
I'll stay for as long as God wills,
if you don't mind.

541
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:25,215
When you tire of me,
you just have to say so.

542
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:27,418
But for a separated woman,

543
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:29,713
who's better company than her mother?

544
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:34,161
Unless you've got yourself a sweety-pie.

545
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:35,921
No, mom.

546
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,058
I'm alone, like always.

547
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,492
Not anymore.

548
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:44,130
Answer the phone.

549
00:44:47,008 --> 00:44:49,067
- Are you back?
- Yes.

550
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,471
You were out of range so I rang Agustina.

551
00:44:51,746 --> 00:44:53,236
She said it all went very well.

552
00:44:53,814 --> 00:44:55,076
The whole village came.

553
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,681
I've been thinking about you all day.
I really wanted to be there.

554
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:02,052
Hang on, Sole.

555
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,849
What do I owe for the drinks?

556
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:08,660
They're on the house.

557
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:11,922
- Well, tomorrow, same time.
- Sure.

558
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:14,158
- The crew were very happy.
- I'm glad.

559
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:16,959
If you don't mind,
and even if you charge more,

560
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:19,503
could the helpings be more generous?

561
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:23,000
Tomorrow, you'll have food
coming out your eyes.

562
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:25,505
- Great, see you then.
- So long.

563
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:29,643
Sorry, Sole.

564
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,216
Have you got ajob in a restaurant too?

565
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,820
Yes, I've taken over Emilio's place.

566
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:36,114
Good Lord!

567
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:38,917
He was sick of it,
but that's not the only news.

568
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:41,522
Paco has left us.

569
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:43,792
That's why I couldn't go to the funeral.

570
00:45:43,998 --> 00:45:45,727
We were having a row when you rang.

571
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:47,366
I knew something was wrong.

572
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:49,934
Did he hit you?

573
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:52,336
Paco wasn't violent.

574
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:54,404
He's just gone,

575
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:56,303
forever.

576
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:58,668
He'll come back, you'll see.

577
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,506
I doubt it.

578
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:01,874
Why are you so sure?

579
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,675
You can tell these things.

580
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:07,418
Well, so long.

581
00:46:08,656 --> 00:46:09,554
So long.

582
00:46:10,057 --> 00:46:10,921
'Bye.

583
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:15,320
None of the three of us
had any luck with men.

584
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:18,657
Raimunda and I didn't, but you...

585
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,358
Me, what?

586
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:22,032
Dad adored you.

587
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:25,431
Raimunda says that you were lucky,

588
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:28,266
you died in the arms
of the person you loved most.

589
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:31,034
Your sister isn't a bad person
but she's got a nasty streak.

590
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:34,070
I was blind about him

591
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:37,273
and he cheated on me
until the day he died!

592
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:40,580
- What do you mean?
- It's true.

593
00:46:40,955 --> 00:46:43,890
I kept that quiet all my life.
I never wanted you two to know.

594
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:47,652
But let's drop it. I don't want
to talk ill of the dead.

595
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:51,424
- Is he going to appear?
- I hope not.

596
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:53,726
And your husband?

597
00:46:54,635 --> 00:46:55,795
What about him?

598
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,033
Might he turn up some day?

599
00:46:58,439 --> 00:46:59,497
I doubt it.

600
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:01,804
I haven't heard from him in two years.

601
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:05,637
All the better. It'll just be
the two of us together.

602
00:47:58,265 --> 00:48:01,393
- The pork cost you... 10?
- 10.80.

603
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:04,861
- I'll give you an extra 3 euros.
- Thanks, love.

604
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:08,439
And I'll pay you for four boxes
of cookies, not three.

605
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:09,809
Thanks.

606
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,534
I don't want you to think I'd cheat you.

607
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:17,414
Could you help me with this?
I can't move it on my own.

608
00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:19,944
- Where are you taking it?
- To the restaurant.

609
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:23,346
You're the expert in removals.
Where do we?

610
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:26,583
Get a hold of it,
tip it over, but not all the way.

611
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:29,592
- Otherwise we won't get it through.
- Is this all right?

612
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:33,164
Now, straighten up, to the right,
more to the right...

613
00:48:33,367 --> 00:48:36,302
- We can't see anything.
- I'll guide you.

614
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:38,995
Careful, it'll come this way.

615
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:41,797
All the way...

616
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:42,998
Don't rush it.

617
00:48:45,145 --> 00:48:46,169
Are we at the door?

618
00:48:47,114 --> 00:48:49,446
The elevator is here.

619
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:53,386
Wait, wait. This has to go in straight.

620
00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:55,179
I'll take this end.

621
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:57,147
You take it.

622
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:58,450
You're doing fine.

623
00:48:58,792 --> 00:48:59,850
Good Lord! This is tough.

624
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,186
Careful!

625
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,126
Call it from downstairs.

626
00:49:12,206 --> 00:49:14,071
I want them to see
we don't use frozen food.

627
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:16,466
It's all natural, fresh every day.

628
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:18,269
Over to the corner.

629
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:20,976
- And the other freezer?
- It's broken.

630
00:49:21,382 --> 00:49:22,906
So you're taking over the restaurant?

631
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,783
Yes, at least until the crew
finishes the film.

632
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:28,546
Then I'll see.

633
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:32,017
You can count on me.
I make great desserts.

634
00:49:32,326 --> 00:49:34,487
And I can serve drinks at night.

635
00:49:35,195 --> 00:49:38,460
I don't know if we'll work nights,
but I'm counting on you.

636
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:40,258
- Sure.
- And thanks.

637
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:45,238
Mom...

638
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,874
Is there anything you want me to do?

639
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:53,440
Cut my hair.

640
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:56,344
I mean,

641
00:49:57,184 --> 00:49:58,845
is there anything

642
00:49:59,353 --> 00:50:01,048
you left undone in life

643
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:03,390
that won't let you rest in peace?

644
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:07,017
People always leave things undone,

645
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:09,526
or done badly,

646
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:12,326
and I'm no exception.

647
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:15,566
But I don't know if they can be fixed.

648
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:17,734
And if they can,

649
00:50:18,205 --> 00:50:20,070
it's up to me to fix them.

650
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,941
My clients will be arriving soon.
What'll we do?

651
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:29,013
Look after them. I'll help you.

652
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:32,781
But I can't say you're my mother.
They know I'm an orphan.

653
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,555
- I'll say I'm a foreigner.
- A foreigner?

654
00:50:37,157 --> 00:50:38,283
From where?

655
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:40,060
Dominican Republic?

656
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,253
No, there are lots around here,
they'd notice your accent.

657
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:47,257
Chinese?

658
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:51,367
- Madrid's full of Chinese.
- Who'd believe you're Chinese!

659
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:54,430
Something we don't have around here.

660
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:56,836
Russian!

661
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:02,542
Do I really look more
Russian than Chinese?

662
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,310
Yes, the Russians are like us.

663
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,687
Look, whatever you hear,
keep your mouth shut.

664
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:12,587
And don't let them see
that you understand us.

665
00:51:13,627 --> 00:51:15,424
I'll show you how everything works.

666
00:51:15,763 --> 00:51:17,628
In the bedroom, I cut, dry and color,

667
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:19,355
and here I wash their hair.

668
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:25,335
If the client is tall, lift this up.
If she's small, put it down.

669
00:51:25,973 --> 00:51:28,533
This towel is to keep you from slipping.

670
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:30,636
And I keep this here

671
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,069
because up above it's very uncomfortable

672
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:34,506
and if it's down there

673
00:51:34,748 --> 00:51:37,717
I have to bend down so often
I wreck my back.

674
00:51:38,352 --> 00:51:39,751
I get a lot of backaches too.

675
00:51:40,587 --> 00:51:42,214
And the shampoo is measured out.

676
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:43,613
Sit down.

677
00:51:49,363 --> 00:51:50,660
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

678
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:53,798
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

679
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:55,093
I'm the same.

680
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:58,269
And then, with that same towel,

681
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:01,439
you dry her hair a bit
so it doesn't drip down her back.

682
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:04,843
It's all so well organized.
You're very smart, love.

683
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:13,545
Hello.

684
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:20,122
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian.

685
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:21,851
They're in a terrible state.

686
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:23,324
I took her in out of charity.

687
00:52:24,198 --> 00:52:25,893
When I saw her begging in the street,

688
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:27,191
she reminded me of my mother.

689
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:29,197
Don't trust all the old women you see,

690
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:30,893
especially Russians.
There are lots of mafias.

691
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:33,129
People take advantage of you.

692
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,568
Are you getting streaks?
Sit down here.

693
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:39,574
Wash hair, yes.

694
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,408
- She was a hairdresser in Russia.
- How do you communicate?

695
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:45,477
With signs. She understands
everything. She's sharp.

696
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:47,446
She'll speak Spanish in no time.

697
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:50,885
Yes, look at all the top models
who are Russian.

698
00:52:51,091 --> 00:52:52,217
Heavens!

699
00:52:56,897 --> 00:52:59,422
- So, Russian?
- Russia.

700
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:07,067
The water,

701
00:53:08,008 --> 00:53:08,667
not hot,

702
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:10,366
not cold.

703
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:13,177
Very good.

704
00:53:29,863 --> 00:53:30,761
Hello.

705
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:32,663
Hey, there.

706
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:34,860
We have a day off tomorrow.

707
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:38,763
Then we'll have one too.
We need a break.

708
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:41,699
And we finish up next week.

709
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:44,170
We wanted to have the wrap party here.

710
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:45,536
Great.

711
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,673
Do you want a sit-down meal
or a buffet?

712
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:51,216
A buffet would be great.

713
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:54,747
And we'd like to have
the terrace just for us.

714
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:57,483
That's no problem.

715
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:03,053
Don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

716
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:05,255
Same here.

717
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,464
Go and have a drink, I'm working.

718
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:09,899
All right.

719
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:14,966
She's been strange
since she came back from the village.

720
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:17,668
If she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

721
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,305
And it's true.

722
00:54:19,813 --> 00:54:21,405
The less you know the better.

723
00:54:21,648 --> 00:54:23,809
And above all
don't keep thinking about it.

724
00:54:37,998 --> 00:54:39,693
Hello.

725
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:42,832
- Are you with someone?
- No.

726
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:46,071
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- What for?

727
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:47,833
I'm dying to piss.

728
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:51,234
It's broken.
I'm waiting for the plumber.

729
00:54:51,445 --> 00:54:54,414
I'll throw some water down,
for Christ's sake! I have to piss.

730
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:58,509
Hello!

731
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:02,285
What's wrong with you?

732
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:05,717
- I'm at a difficult age.
- You're not the only one.

733
00:55:05,926 --> 00:55:08,861
- I'm going to trim your hair.
- No, I know you.

734
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:11,656
- Just the ends.
- Less than a centimeter.

735
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:19,938
Tell me,

736
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:22,536
has your dad not come back?

737
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:26,110
No. He said goodbye for good.

738
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:30,583
That's incredible.
I just don't understand.

739
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,377
It smells of farts!

740
00:55:41,662 --> 00:55:42,890
What's your mother up to?

741
00:55:43,563 --> 00:55:44,359
What?

742
00:55:44,564 --> 00:55:47,328
She's such a pain!
Ever since she was a child.

743
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:50,928
And in those days
we didn't have a bathroom.

744
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:53,373
We did it in the yard.

745
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:55,404
We'd be waiting for her all day.

746
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:58,472
All day long she'd be in the yard,
with the hens.

747
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:38,074
This dressing gown...

748
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:40,084
It's Mom's.

749
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:41,748
I know that.

750
00:56:43,857 --> 00:56:45,119
And the smell?

751
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:48,119
What smell?

752
00:56:48,428 --> 00:56:49,918
In the bathroom and here.

753
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:53,832
It's as if Mom had just been here,
farting her ass off!

754
00:56:54,034 --> 00:56:55,262
Don't you smell it?

755
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:02,402
The way she used to fart!

756
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:07,744
And she could never hide it
because she was the first to laugh!

757
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:13,746
It's as if I can hear her now.

758
00:57:16,356 --> 00:57:17,823
Don't be silly!

759
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,464
Why did you bring these clothes?

760
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:29,596
No wonder you have nightmares.

761
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,370
You give away dead people's clothes.

762
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:39,769
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

763
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:57,362
The antique dolls!

764
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,371
Her jewel case!

765
00:58:11,678 --> 00:58:13,339
What were you going to do with this?

766
00:58:15,081 --> 00:58:16,048
Nothing.

767
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:18,114
You were going to keep it.

768
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:19,544
Really, Sole.

769
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:21,277
Don't get the wrong idea.

770
00:58:22,189 --> 00:58:23,656
I didn't bring the case.

771
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,217
Then why is it here?

772
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:31,893
When I got to Aunt Paula's house...

773
00:58:32,899 --> 00:58:33,866
What?

774
00:58:36,436 --> 00:58:38,267
I'd never have believed this.

775
00:58:39,673 --> 00:58:43,268
Stealing the few things she had
before she was even in the grave.

776
00:58:44,211 --> 00:58:45,303
What a nerve!

777
00:58:49,115 --> 00:58:50,810
Don't go off like that!

778
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:25,008
We have to buy another fridge.

779
00:59:26,586 --> 00:59:28,577
Why not fix the one in the storeroom?

780
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:31,518
It doesn't work.

781
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:35,158
The motor's making a noise.

782
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:39,127
I said no one is to go in there,
including you.

783
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,629
The door was open,
I went in for a hammer.

784
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:44,468
Has anyone else been in?

785
00:59:45,038 --> 00:59:46,005
I don't think so.

786
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,876
You said you'd got rid of him.

787
00:59:55,282 --> 00:59:56,749
I wasn't able to.

788
00:59:57,584 --> 00:59:59,609
You think I like having him in there?

789
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:08,721
Get dressed, everyone
will be arriving soon.

790
01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:19,899
Why are you still like that?

791
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,274
- I'm not in a party mood.
- Neither am I, but it's work.

792
01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:27,169
Don't be such a lazybones.

793
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:29,908
Come on, pet, I'll help you.

794
01:00:32,085 --> 01:00:33,245
What's wrong?

795
01:00:33,653 --> 01:00:37,555
I can't forget about it
when he's so near, in the storeroom.

796
01:00:38,959 --> 01:00:41,826
That's the best way to go crazy,
and to drive me crazy too.

797
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:45,053
You don't know what it's like
to have killed your father.

798
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:48,424
Paco wasn't your father.

799
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,694
Don't lie to me anymore.

800
01:00:52,072 --> 01:00:55,599
I know you're doing it for me,
but, please, don't lie.

801
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:57,140
I'm not lying.

802
01:00:57,644 --> 01:00:59,612
He recognized you as his daughter

803
01:00:59,946 --> 01:01:02,176
but he knew he wasn't
your biological father.

804
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:09,779
So was he telling me the truth?

805
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,057
Yes.

806
01:01:11,758 --> 01:01:13,487
But that doesn't justify what he did.

807
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:21,028
I promise I'll tell you everything
another time.

808
01:01:22,035 --> 01:01:24,526
What's the point of sitting here?

809
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:27,104
Who was my father?

810
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:30,471
A guy in the village.

811
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:31,837
Do I know him?

812
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,111
He's dead.

813
01:01:36,983 --> 01:01:39,213
I'll tell you everything.

814
01:01:39,986 --> 01:01:41,078
I swear.

815
01:01:41,688 --> 01:01:42,882
I'll hold you to your word.

816
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,498
- Two mojitos!
- Coming up!

817
01:01:58,004 --> 01:02:00,768
What about you, love? Another two?

818
01:02:01,174 --> 01:02:03,802
With lemon. It's perfect.

819
01:02:10,483 --> 01:02:12,348
We need more glasses.

820
01:02:12,552 --> 01:02:14,019
I can hardly keep up.

821
01:02:14,654 --> 01:02:16,246
Isn't Paula looking pretty?

822
01:02:21,461 --> 01:02:22,393
Here.

823
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:23,992
Thanks.

824
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:28,527
How delicious!

825
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:30,896
I can't take any more.
They're really good.

826
01:02:31,104 --> 01:02:34,437
With your cleavage and my mojitos,
we'd make a fortune.

827
01:02:34,808 --> 01:02:38,403
We should start working nights
and try to liven up

828
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,178
this lousy neighborhood.

829
01:02:40,413 --> 01:02:43,712
We'll talk about that. First,
we have to keep this lot happy.

830
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,939
Have a mojito!

831
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:47,677
Keep down, they mustn't see you!

832
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:50,487
I'd like to see Raimunda and Paula.

833
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,782
The other day, I only saw their feet.

834
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,459
And look at the fuss you caused!

835
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:58,563
Is that the restaurant?

836
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:03,400
She said it was going well
but I never imagined this!

837
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,164
She deserves it.

838
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:07,664
She's had a hard time.

839
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:19,883
Stay in the car
and don't let anyone see you.

840
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:21,451
No one can see me here!

841
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:54,915
What are you doing here?

842
01:03:55,855 --> 01:03:56,822
This is great!

843
01:03:57,023 --> 01:04:00,857
I've brought you Aunt Paula's things.
I didn't know about the party.

844
01:04:01,427 --> 01:04:03,588
It's a film crew celebrating
the end of the shoot.

845
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,696
I've been catering for them.

846
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:07,856
Let's put the suitcase away.

847
01:04:08,501 --> 01:04:09,525
Why did you bother?

848
01:04:09,969 --> 01:04:12,403
I'd never have kept anything of Auntie's,

849
01:04:12,772 --> 01:04:14,103
much less hidden it from you.

850
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,340
I know that.
I'm sorry for what I said.

851
01:04:16,543 --> 01:04:18,568
I always shoot my mouth off.

852
01:04:18,778 --> 01:04:20,040
Hello, Auntie.

853
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:23,946
- You want anything?
- No.

854
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:49,205
I can see the twinkling
of the lights in the distance

855
01:04:49,409 --> 01:04:51,934
that are marking my return.

856
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:53,646
Remember?

857
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,674
How could I forget?

858
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,550
It's so long since I heard you sing!

859
01:04:59,419 --> 01:05:01,080
I've never heard her sing.

860
01:05:04,224 --> 01:05:05,156
Really?

861
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:07,050
Really, never.

862
01:05:09,095 --> 01:05:12,622
- Would you like to?
- What do you think? Of course!

863
01:05:18,738 --> 01:05:19,636
Come on.

864
01:05:23,943 --> 01:05:25,137
I can't believe it.

865
01:05:35,488 --> 01:05:36,420
Sit there.

866
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,924
Be quiet!

867
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:47,462
Sit down! This woman's going to sing!

868
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:53,433
Good evening.

869
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,431
I'd like to thank the crew

870
01:05:56,643 --> 01:05:59,237
for the work you've given us
these past weeks.

871
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:01,440
Thank you so much.

872
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:04,375
I haven't sung for a very long time

873
01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:07,379
but I'll do it tonight,
and see how it goes.

874
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:25,936
I'm afraid of the encounter

875
01:06:26,673 --> 01:06:29,938
with the past that's coming back

876
01:06:30,143 --> 01:06:33,271
to confront my life.

877
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:35,809
Your grandma taught her that song

878
01:06:36,015 --> 01:06:37,346
for the casting for child singers.

879
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:42,078
I'm afraid of the nights

880
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:45,823
that, filled with memories,

881
01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:49,324
enchain my dreams.

882
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:51,996
But the fleeing traveller

883
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:55,531
sooner or later must come to a halt,

884
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:59,000
and even though oblivion,
which destroys everything,

885
01:06:59,205 --> 01:07:02,572
has killed my old illusions,

886
01:07:02,775 --> 01:07:05,767
I still retain a humble hope hidden away

887
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,744
and that is all of my heart's fortune.

888
01:07:10,049 --> 01:07:15,385
Coming back

889
01:07:17,657 --> 01:07:19,887
with a wrinkled forehead

890
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:22,254
and the snows of time

891
01:07:22,528 --> 01:07:24,086
silvering my brow.

892
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:27,926
Feeling

893
01:07:28,201 --> 01:07:31,466
that life is an instant,

894
01:07:31,671 --> 01:07:33,605
that twenty years is nothing,

895
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:35,467
that the feverish eyes

896
01:07:35,675 --> 01:07:38,838
wandering in the shadows
seek you and name you.

897
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:41,206
Living

898
01:07:42,181 --> 01:07:44,206
with my soul clinging

899
01:07:44,417 --> 01:07:46,783
to a sweet memory

900
01:07:46,986 --> 01:07:49,614
that I weep for again.

901
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:26,755
Autos Amigos.

902
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,990
I'm calling because I saw your ad.

903
01:08:32,565 --> 01:08:33,532
I need to rent a van.

904
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:35,724
What kind, and for how long?

905
01:08:36,035 --> 01:08:38,697
The cheapest one you have.
It's just for one day.

906
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,108
Yes?

907
01:08:46,012 --> 01:08:47,639
Could I speak to Miss Raimunda?

908
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:49,348
Speaking.

909
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:52,980
Emilio gave me your number,
so you could show me the restaurant.

910
01:08:53,186 --> 01:08:56,121
I'm very keen to see it.
My name is Carlos.

911
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,218
Well,

912
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:01,656
you should have called earlier

913
01:09:02,295 --> 01:09:05,059
because a neighbor has taken it over.

914
01:09:05,398 --> 01:09:07,423
Emilio didn't tell me that.

915
01:09:08,534 --> 01:09:11,196
That's his strategy, just in case.

916
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:13,572
Could I speak to the person
who's taken it over?

917
01:09:14,774 --> 01:09:16,935
This is her day off, I'm sorry.

918
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:20,274
If you call Emilio
I'm sure he'll explain everything.

919
01:09:21,747 --> 01:09:22,941
Thank you.

920
01:09:23,983 --> 01:09:25,109
Goodbye.

921
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,798
Emilio? It's Raimunda.

922
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:43,059
It's great to hear you.
Did a man go to see the restaurant?

923
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:46,761
Yes, but I didn't trust him.
I think he wanted it as a front.

924
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:48,531
For what?

925
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:52,304
For drugs, or to open a brothel.
I don't know.

926
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:56,140
When I said it wasn't doing well
he said that was even better, so...

927
01:09:56,349 --> 01:09:58,613
Why on earth did you say that?

928
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:02,619
I've been meaning to call you for days.

929
01:10:03,489 --> 01:10:04,956
I hope you understand.

930
01:10:05,992 --> 01:10:08,290
I know it's not the way to do things

931
01:10:10,429 --> 01:10:12,090
but I've taken over the restaurant.

932
01:10:12,298 --> 01:10:14,562
You? What do you mean?

933
01:10:16,235 --> 01:10:17,964
I can explain it all to you.

934
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:21,032
You were out of line, way out of line.

935
01:10:22,775 --> 01:10:24,299
You abused my trust.

936
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:26,769
It's no excuse,

937
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:29,675
but when the film crew appeared,
I was desperate.

938
01:10:30,283 --> 01:10:32,717
And now that Paco's left us,
you can imagine...

939
01:10:32,919 --> 01:10:34,580
What? Paco's left you?

940
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:37,515
Yes. We had a huge fight.

941
01:10:37,957 --> 01:10:40,187
He's gone,
and I don't think he'll be back.

942
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,653
He left the same day
you went to Barcelona.

943
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,292
How are you coping?

944
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:47,833
Me? I'm hysterical.

945
01:10:48,401 --> 01:10:50,301
Clutching at straws.

946
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:53,503
Well, we'll try to sort it out.

947
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:57,942
Tell me what I owe for the month
and I'll send it to you,

948
01:10:58,578 --> 01:10:59,806
but give me a few days.

949
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,562
- Hello?
- Raimunda?

950
01:11:23,336 --> 01:11:24,325
Yes, who's that?

951
01:11:24,537 --> 01:11:28,200
It's Agustina. I'm in Madrid
and I'd like to see you.

952
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:32,708
It's difficult, I'm really busy today.

953
01:11:32,945 --> 01:11:33,707
Tomorrow?

954
01:11:33,913 --> 01:11:36,677
No, the whole week is a real mess.

955
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:39,680
Don't say that. I'm in the hospital.

956
01:11:40,252 --> 01:11:41,344
What's wrong?

957
01:11:41,654 --> 01:11:44,817
I've got cancer.
The doctors told me yesterday.

958
01:11:45,491 --> 01:11:46,719
I need to see you.

959
01:11:48,127 --> 01:11:50,254
Tell me what hospital you're in,
I'll come today.

960
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:52,186
I'm in Central Hospital.

961
01:11:53,566 --> 01:11:55,500
God bless you.

962
01:12:02,141 --> 01:12:04,769
You go up, I'm in a hurry.
Give this to your aunt.

963
01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:14,378
- Hello, Auntie.
- What are you doing here?

964
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,723
Is that your mother shouting?

965
01:12:20,326 --> 01:12:22,260
Come to the window!

966
01:12:25,031 --> 01:12:25,725
What?

967
01:12:25,931 --> 01:12:27,262
I'm leaving Paula with you.

968
01:12:27,533 --> 01:12:29,160
But I'm working.

969
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:32,895
I have to go to the hospital
to see Agustina. She's got cancer.

970
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:35,140
What a pity, the poor thing.

971
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:37,935
Paula is bringing up Auntie's case.
Keep it.

972
01:12:38,778 --> 01:12:42,077
I've got to do a few things
and then I'll come back.

973
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:43,975
Give my regards to Agustina.

974
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:47,079
- Tell her you saw me!
- Yes, nuisance.

975
01:12:50,723 --> 01:12:51,917
Can I come in now?

976
01:12:54,026 --> 01:12:55,186
Yes, love.

977
01:13:16,148 --> 01:13:17,274
How are you?

978
01:13:21,187 --> 01:13:23,052
They opened then closed me up again.

979
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:27,854
- I knew I had something nasty.
- Don't give up hope.

980
01:13:29,628 --> 01:13:31,425
The flowers are lovely!

981
01:13:32,264 --> 01:13:35,392
You shouldn't have bothered.
Leave them there.

982
01:13:39,572 --> 01:13:43,838
I have to ask you a favor.

983
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,000
Whatever you want.

984
01:13:47,313 --> 01:13:48,644
Close the door.

985
01:13:53,018 --> 01:13:54,178
Get a chair.

986
01:14:05,664 --> 01:14:07,393
I won't last very long,

987
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:11,727
but I don't want to die without
knowing what happened to my mother.

988
01:14:13,706 --> 01:14:15,105
But what can I do?

989
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:19,675
You can tell me if she's alive or dead.

990
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:22,976
How will I know?

991
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:24,714
Ask your mother.

992
01:14:26,385 --> 01:14:29,252
My mother? She's dead!

993
01:14:29,588 --> 01:14:33,080
But she appeared to your Aunt Paula

994
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:36,123
and looked after her until she died.
The whole village knows that.

995
01:14:37,363 --> 01:14:41,265
If she should appear to you,
ask her about my mother.

996
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:43,359
That's all I'm asking.

997
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:45,864
What you're asking me is crazy.

998
01:14:46,572 --> 01:14:48,767
Did you ever see her
with your own eyes?

999
01:14:49,575 --> 01:14:50,473
No.

1000
01:14:50,676 --> 01:14:52,667
And you live across the street.

1001
01:14:53,112 --> 01:14:55,137
I think she hid from me.

1002
01:14:56,048 --> 01:14:59,540
But I heard your aunt talking to her
a thousand times.

1003
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,248
If I hear anything, I'll tell you.

1004
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:08,153
But I think it's unlikely.

1005
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,461
You owe me this.

1006
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:16,200
It's all I'm asking.

1007
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:18,696
I have to go, I've got lots to do.

1008
01:15:19,338 --> 01:15:22,671
Wait, my sister wants to see you.
She'll be here any minute.

1009
01:15:22,942 --> 01:15:25,172
Some other day, I'm in a real hurry.

1010
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:27,375
She wants you to go on TV.

1011
01:15:28,581 --> 01:15:31,607
You know she works on
"Wherever You Are".

1012
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:34,481
They want to surprise her
and they thought of you.

1013
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,486
You were friends as children
and you both went to an audition.

1014
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:41,386
That's enough for several shows,

1015
01:15:41,594 --> 01:15:44,085
with interviews, music and songs

1016
01:15:44,363 --> 01:15:47,332
from yesterday, from today
and for all times.

1017
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:49,658
Tell her I don't like television.

1018
01:15:50,569 --> 01:15:54,005
Neither do I. I'll tell her,
but don't forget what I said.

1019
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,572
I won't.

1020
01:15:58,444 --> 01:16:00,435
The Russian loves TV.

1021
01:16:02,348 --> 01:16:05,181
I don't know if she understands
but she's hypnotized.

1022
01:16:05,851 --> 01:16:07,819
There's something about trash TV.

1023
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,114
Once I start watching it, I can't stop.

1024
01:16:11,657 --> 01:16:14,785
I feel worse and worse but I'm hooked.

1025
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:16,556
It's like a drug.

1026
01:16:17,096 --> 01:16:18,927
I had to stop watching it at night.

1027
01:16:19,398 --> 01:16:21,229
I couldn't sleep afterwards.

1028
01:16:21,433 --> 01:16:23,799
All that shouting drives you crazy.

1029
01:16:26,105 --> 01:16:27,367
Do you like dolls?

1030
01:16:28,007 --> 01:16:30,805
I like these, they look like
they're from a horror movie.

1031
01:16:31,176 --> 01:16:32,541
They're very ancient.

1032
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:36,312
Your mom played with them
when she was pregnant with you.

1033
01:16:37,082 --> 01:16:38,777
Why didn't mom live with you?

1034
01:16:40,019 --> 01:16:41,987
We were very short on money.

1035
01:16:42,721 --> 01:16:44,848
Your granddad went to work
in Venezuela,

1036
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:46,849
I kept Sole

1037
01:16:47,526 --> 01:16:49,653
and your mother went to live
with Aunt Paula.

1038
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:52,827
What has she told you?

1039
01:16:53,132 --> 01:16:55,464
Nothing, she doesn't like
talking about that time.

1040
01:16:57,002 --> 01:16:58,060
Do you get along well?

1041
01:16:58,637 --> 01:16:59,797
It's better now,

1042
01:17:00,372 --> 01:17:02,363
but at times
she's really stroppy, grandma.

1043
01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:04,041
She's got a temper.

1044
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:05,934
How did you get along with her?

1045
01:17:06,845 --> 01:17:09,575
When she was little
she was the apple of my eye,

1046
01:17:10,616 --> 01:17:12,811
but as a teenager

1047
01:17:13,786 --> 01:17:16,050
for some reason I didn't know

1048
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:18,883
she grew away from me

1049
01:17:20,459 --> 01:17:22,654
until I lost her completely.

1050
01:17:24,363 --> 01:17:25,955
Your mother didn't love me.

1051
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,895
It really hurts when a daughter
doesn't love her mother.

1052
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:35,266
That's why,

1053
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:38,041
now that it's just the two of you,

1054
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,307
you have to love her very much

1055
01:17:40,746 --> 01:17:42,145
and she has to feel that.

1056
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:44,939
Why have you come back?

1057
01:17:48,354 --> 01:17:49,719
Because I was very lonely.

1058
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:55,150
Good afternoon.

1059
01:17:57,129 --> 01:18:00,030
I need eight meters of
plastic clothes line

1060
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:01,758
and some packing tape.

1061
01:18:01,967 --> 01:18:03,161
How much tape?

1062
01:18:03,369 --> 01:18:04,666
Four or five rolls.

1063
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,059
Very well.

1064
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:08,297
Five rolls.

1065
01:18:12,678 --> 01:18:13,576
One...

1066
01:18:14,847 --> 01:18:15,506
Two...

1067
01:18:15,714 --> 01:18:17,773
And a pick and a shovel.

1068
01:18:18,517 --> 01:18:19,279
Very well.

1069
01:18:59,758 --> 01:19:01,453
How are you, Raimunda?

1070
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:03,358
Fed up.

1071
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:04,721
How's Agustina?

1072
01:19:05,064 --> 01:19:06,156
Mad as a hatter.

1073
01:19:06,432 --> 01:19:07,262
Hi, mom!

1074
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:10,762
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

1075
01:19:11,804 --> 01:19:13,772
Fetch me a glass of water, love.

1076
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,840
Do you mind
if she stays here tonight?

1077
01:19:17,476 --> 01:19:19,444
No, but where will she sleep?

1078
01:19:19,878 --> 01:19:21,072
In the spare room.

1079
01:19:23,048 --> 01:19:25,949
Paco's coming over tonight.
He wants to talk.

1080
01:19:26,351 --> 01:19:27,716
I'd like us to be alone.

1081
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:30,017
All right.

1082
01:19:31,657 --> 01:19:33,352
You're sleeping here tonight.

1083
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:42,423
I'm off. I've got a long night
ahead of me.

1084
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:17,729
I need a favor tonight.

1085
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,234
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

1086
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:23,237
No, but I'll pay you, like any client.

1087
01:20:23,442 --> 01:20:25,603
No, love, for you a discount,

1088
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:29,437
but I didn't know you liked pussy.

1089
01:20:29,648 --> 01:20:30,478
I don't.

1090
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:34,982
So if you don't want to go
muff-diving, what do you want?

1091
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:36,777
I'll explain on the way.

1092
01:20:36,989 --> 01:20:39,480
First, we have to put
the freezer in the van

1093
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:41,090
and take it to a dung heap.

1094
01:20:41,293 --> 01:20:43,488
We can't carry that on our own!

1095
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:45,629
We'll ask the neighbors to help us.

1096
01:20:46,031 --> 01:20:47,896
Put on something comfortable.

1097
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:51,734
You look like
you're going to explode in that.

1098
01:20:54,139 --> 01:20:55,333
It sticks out here.

1099
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:57,441
Get it on the sidewalk.

1100
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:00,708
- It's slipping!
- No, it's not.

1101
01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:08,352
Get it parallel to that.

1102
01:21:08,554 --> 01:21:11,853
Now, up! One, two, three!

1103
01:21:15,694 --> 01:21:17,321
Push!

1104
01:21:21,967 --> 01:21:22,991
It's in.

1105
01:21:23,202 --> 01:21:27,468
- Bloody hell.
- Did you hurt yourself?

1106
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:30,672
Who needs a spleen, anyway?

1107
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:34,601
Where are we going?

1108
01:21:36,114 --> 01:21:37,638
To the Jucar River.

1109
01:21:38,016 --> 01:21:39,142
Where's that?

1110
01:21:40,085 --> 01:21:41,643
180 kilometers away.

1111
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:46,017
What? It'll take us all night
just to go and come back.

1112
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,849
I said I'd pay by the hour.

1113
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,420
Just to go with you?

1114
01:21:49,995 --> 01:21:51,428
To come with me to the river,
dig a hole,

1115
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:55,157
bury the freezer and not ask questions.

1116
01:21:55,601 --> 01:21:58,161
Look, I appreciate your trust

1117
01:21:58,737 --> 01:22:01,001
but my life's complicated enough!

1118
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:05,504
I have no job, no papers,
I have to work the streets to survive.

1119
01:22:05,711 --> 01:22:07,076
Christ, you could have asked me!

1120
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:09,144
I'm asking you now. How much?

1121
01:22:09,348 --> 01:22:10,815
You should've asked first.

1122
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:15,380
All right,

1123
01:22:17,022 --> 01:22:18,182
give me the nights.

1124
01:22:18,724 --> 01:22:19,816
What nights?

1125
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:22,320
The drinks at night, for a month.

1126
01:22:22,961 --> 01:22:24,929
And I keep what I make
from my cocktails.

1127
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,795
And you buy the bottles.

1128
01:22:26,999 --> 01:22:28,330
All right, partner,

1129
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:30,524
but not a word about this.

1130
01:22:31,703 --> 01:22:34,069
What can I do? I'm your accomplice now.

1131
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,174
Just so you know,
I haven't killed anyone.

1132
01:22:37,376 --> 01:22:38,900
Don't tell me anything.

1133
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:40,804
I wasn't going to.

1134
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:21,552
Get out of the way. Give me that.

1135
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:39,894
Oh, my God!

1136
01:23:42,908 --> 01:23:45,069
I can't do any more, I'm dead.

1137
01:23:45,477 --> 01:23:47,468
Take a break, I'll fill this in.

1138
01:24:51,643 --> 01:24:52,735
What are you doing here?

1139
01:24:56,114 --> 01:24:58,776
- Can we talk?
- I'm really busy.

1140
01:25:00,185 --> 01:25:01,174
Come in.

1141
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,351
- How are you?
- The same.

1142
01:25:10,862 --> 01:25:13,330
- Have you found out anything?
- About what?

1143
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:15,194
About what I asked you.

1144
01:25:16,401 --> 01:25:18,426
I didn't think you were serious.

1145
01:25:20,205 --> 01:25:21,638
May I sit down?

1146
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,402
Have pity on me.

1147
01:25:29,347 --> 01:25:31,372
I do, all the pity you want,

1148
01:25:31,817 --> 01:25:33,148
but don't ask crazy things.

1149
01:25:33,351 --> 01:25:35,751
All I want is to know
if she's alive or dead!

1150
01:25:41,026 --> 01:25:44,120
I understand that
with the wind and the cancer

1151
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:45,762
you've lost your mind,

1152
01:25:45,964 --> 01:25:48,364
but you can't complicate
other people's lives.

1153
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,397
We've got enough on our plates.

1154
01:25:52,604 --> 01:25:54,902
The day your parents died in the fire,

1155
01:25:55,774 --> 01:25:57,708
my mother disappeared.

1156
01:26:02,414 --> 01:26:04,712
Don't you think
that's a strange coincidence?

1157
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:07,841
No, it's just a coincidence.

1158
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,518
You said your mother left
in the morning

1159
01:26:12,157 --> 01:26:14,284
and it wasn't the first time
she disappeared.

1160
01:26:14,793 --> 01:26:18,661
Your grandmother had to raise you
because she was never at home!

1161
01:26:18,864 --> 01:26:20,388
Don't make me say more.

1162
01:26:20,832 --> 01:26:22,595
My mother went off that morning

1163
01:26:23,568 --> 01:26:25,866
but it was to join your father
in the hut.

1164
01:26:27,005 --> 01:26:28,029
That's a lie.

1165
01:26:28,907 --> 01:26:30,875
- No one saw her.
- Of course not.

1166
01:26:31,276 --> 01:26:33,210
She made sure of that.

1167
01:26:34,412 --> 01:26:39,475
My mother was having an affair
with your father.

1168
01:26:41,286 --> 01:26:42,446
What are you saying!

1169
01:26:44,923 --> 01:26:48,120
My mother would never have allowed it!

1170
01:26:48,326 --> 01:26:50,760
That's why she went to live
with your Aunt Paula.

1171
01:26:51,363 --> 01:26:53,991
She did that
because my aunt wasn't well

1172
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:56,759
but she never left him.
She went between the two houses.

1173
01:26:56,968 --> 01:26:58,799
You don't know, you weren't there

1174
01:26:59,004 --> 01:27:01,768
and you hardly had any contact
with your mother for years.

1175
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,538
I often heard her complain
you treated her like shit.

1176
01:27:04,743 --> 01:27:06,074
Those were her words!

1177
01:27:08,513 --> 01:27:10,413
I've heard a lot of things.

1178
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:12,976
Once

1179
01:27:13,385 --> 01:27:15,546
I heard a row
between your mother and mine.

1180
01:27:16,388 --> 01:27:18,754
Your mother told her
she could have your father,

1181
01:27:18,957 --> 01:27:20,185
she didn't care.

1182
01:27:20,825 --> 01:27:22,417
And she didn't envy her

1183
01:27:23,028 --> 01:27:25,861
because he'd been born
to hurt the women who loved him.

1184
01:27:29,067 --> 01:27:30,898
What are you getting at?

1185
01:27:32,637 --> 01:27:34,298
That your parents' death

1186
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,636
and my mother's disappearance
are connected.

1187
01:27:40,512 --> 01:27:42,810
Then why haven't you gone
to the police?

1188
01:27:43,848 --> 01:27:45,509
They ask a lot of questions

1189
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:49,114
and we should wash
our dirty linen at home.

1190
01:27:50,522 --> 01:27:53,685
That's why I won't go on TV
even though my sister is insisting.

1191
01:27:54,926 --> 01:27:57,190
You and I have to sort this out.

1192
01:28:00,599 --> 01:28:02,362
I have to get back to work.

1193
01:28:06,504 --> 01:28:07,994
Think about what I said.

1194
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,468
How's Paco?

1195
01:28:11,443 --> 01:28:12,432
What?

1196
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:14,776
He's fine.

1197
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:22,651
Shouldn't we call Auntie
to say we're coming?

1198
01:28:23,021 --> 01:28:24,420
She never goes out.

1199
01:28:24,889 --> 01:28:26,220
We should warn her.

1200
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:27,815
Why?

1201
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,352
It's not polite just to turn up
at someone's house,

1202
01:28:31,563 --> 01:28:32,621
even if she is your sister.

1203
01:28:33,331 --> 01:28:35,094
What's up with you and Sole now?

1204
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:37,861
It's a question of manners.

1205
01:28:38,637 --> 01:28:41,572
You and your aunt
are getting on my fucking nerves!

1206
01:28:41,973 --> 01:28:42,962
You're so vulgar.

1207
01:28:48,947 --> 01:28:50,505
What have you brought, Raimunda?

1208
01:28:51,483 --> 01:28:52,848
Food for the three of us.

1209
01:28:57,255 --> 01:28:58,916
Why did you bother?

1210
01:28:59,124 --> 01:29:01,251
Why are you shouting?
Are you going deaf?

1211
01:29:01,559 --> 01:29:04,119
- Yes, I'm deaf.
- Deaf as a post.

1212
01:29:04,329 --> 01:29:06,627
We're staying a while,
I want you to cut my hair.

1213
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:09,498
Why didn't you call?
I've got a client.

1214
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,733
Don't worry, I'm in no hurry.

1215
01:29:14,506 --> 01:29:15,734
And we have to talk.

1216
01:29:16,574 --> 01:29:19,099
- About what?
- Aunt Paula's house.

1217
01:29:19,477 --> 01:29:22,446
- May I go and watch TV?
- Yes, go on.

1218
01:29:23,448 --> 01:29:26,076
We have to sort out
all the paperwork.

1219
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:29,481
Grandma!

1220
01:29:30,221 --> 01:29:31,188
I'm here.

1221
01:29:31,389 --> 01:29:33,380
Don't make a sound, my mother's here.

1222
01:29:33,591 --> 01:29:34,819
I heard her.

1223
01:29:40,832 --> 01:29:42,697
Where's the Russian?

1224
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,966
- Who's the Russian?
- A woman who's helping me.

1225
01:29:46,438 --> 01:29:49,236
I was telling her about
my son being expelled again.

1226
01:29:49,574 --> 01:29:52,304
He slashed the tires of the priest
who teaches him religion.

1227
01:29:52,844 --> 01:29:54,505
I was telling her
and she left me talking to myself

1228
01:29:54,713 --> 01:29:56,613
with my hair half-washed.

1229
01:29:57,015 --> 01:29:58,243
She must have gone out.

1230
01:29:58,516 --> 01:30:00,916
I don't know,
but she went off like a shot.

1231
01:30:01,219 --> 01:30:02,584
I'll finish you off.

1232
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:05,045
She's got claustrophobia

1233
01:30:05,256 --> 01:30:07,656
and at times she needs to go outside.

1234
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:09,053
Some help she is.

1235
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,385
Do you pay her?

1236
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:12,922
No, I took her in.

1237
01:30:13,598 --> 01:30:16,533
She eats and sleeps here.
I gave her mom's clothes.

1238
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:19,395
I don't like you taking in
people you don't know.

1239
01:30:19,637 --> 01:30:22,663
We told her that.
People take advantage of her.

1240
01:30:23,241 --> 01:30:26,472
Look at the Russian.
She's living in luxury here.

1241
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:28,646
How was Paco the other night?

1242
01:30:29,414 --> 01:30:32,110
Unpleasant. He came to get his clothes.

1243
01:30:32,617 --> 01:30:35,950
I think he's living with someone,
but I couldn't care less.

1244
01:30:37,055 --> 01:30:39,353
Why didn't you tell me
you had a Russian?

1245
01:30:40,658 --> 01:30:42,421
I guess I forgot.

1246
01:30:51,436 --> 01:30:53,802
That's Agustina!

1247
01:30:56,741 --> 01:30:58,538
Good afternoon, Agustina.

1248
01:30:58,977 --> 01:30:59,875
Good afternoon.

1249
01:31:00,078 --> 01:31:01,602
We know from your sister

1250
01:31:01,813 --> 01:31:04,680
that your mother was a single parent.

1251
01:31:04,983 --> 01:31:09,113
My mother was a hippie.

1252
01:31:10,789 --> 01:31:12,154
That's Agustina!

1253
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,618
She never married.

1254
01:31:14,492 --> 01:31:16,323
So she practiced free love.

1255
01:31:16,694 --> 01:31:18,662
Your mother had a friend

1256
01:31:18,863 --> 01:31:21,491
who died the same day she disappeared.

1257
01:31:24,469 --> 01:31:25,800
How did she die?

1258
01:31:26,704 --> 01:31:28,001
In a fire.

1259
01:31:28,273 --> 01:31:30,741
There are lots of fires in my village,

1260
01:31:30,975 --> 01:31:32,340
because of the East wind.

1261
01:31:32,644 --> 01:31:35,636
Agustina's village is the wonderful
Alcanfor de las Infantas

1262
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,609
which, according to statistics,

1263
01:31:37,849 --> 01:31:42,684
has the highest rate of insanity
per inhabitant.

1264
01:31:42,887 --> 01:31:46,414
Do you think that perhaps
your mother was mentally unbalanced?

1265
01:31:47,525 --> 01:31:53,191
When my mother wasn't well,
as she was a hippie,

1266
01:31:53,565 --> 01:31:55,123
she'd leave the village.

1267
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:58,268
Until one day she left
and never came back.

1268
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:01,867
Yes, that was almost four years ago.

1269
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,666
We're very interested
in that friend of hers who died

1270
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:09,173
the same day your mother
disappeared. Tell us about that.

1271
01:32:10,882 --> 01:32:11,906
About what?

1272
01:32:12,183 --> 01:32:16,620
We'd like you to tell us about
the woman who died in the fire.

1273
01:32:16,988 --> 01:32:20,048
- You know there are rumors...
- I don't believe in rumors.

1274
01:32:20,258 --> 01:32:23,819
I'd like you to explain
what you told our producer.

1275
01:32:24,195 --> 01:32:27,062
It was something important about
that woman and her husband

1276
01:32:27,265 --> 01:32:29,358
that linked them
to your mother's disappearance.

1277
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:30,898
Is that true?

1278
01:32:33,204 --> 01:32:34,762
I'd rather...

1279
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:38,504
not talk about that.

1280
01:32:38,877 --> 01:32:40,640
Those were suppositions of mine.

1281
01:32:41,446 --> 01:32:45,974
But you're here to talk about
that woman and your mother.

1282
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:48,446
I've changed my mind.

1283
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:50,644
SHE CAN'T BELIEVE HER SISTER

1284
01:32:50,855 --> 01:32:54,313
What's wrong? You look
uncomfortable, a bit nervous.

1285
01:32:55,093 --> 01:32:56,890
I'd like to explain

1286
01:32:57,095 --> 01:32:58,960
that Agustina is also here to tell us

1287
01:32:59,163 --> 01:33:01,825
that she's got a terminal illness.

1288
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:03,100
Isn't that so?

1289
01:33:04,202 --> 01:33:06,102
Agustina has got cancer.

1290
01:33:10,308 --> 01:33:11,798
You've got cancer.

1291
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:14,770
But don't be nervous,
you're among friends.

1292
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:17,047
A big hand for Agustina!

1293
01:33:24,989 --> 01:33:27,014
Agustina has got a special wish.

1294
01:33:27,725 --> 01:33:29,716
To go to a clinic in Houston.

1295
01:33:30,328 --> 01:33:33,388
But to go to Houston,
you have to speak out.

1296
01:33:33,798 --> 01:33:36,392
Remember, you made
a commitment to this channel.

1297
01:34:04,696 --> 01:34:06,664
Agustina came to see me.

1298
01:34:07,131 --> 01:34:08,189
She did?

1299
01:34:08,533 --> 01:34:10,592
She insists that mom appears to us.

1300
01:34:10,868 --> 01:34:12,426
She wants me to ask her about her mother.

1301
01:34:14,005 --> 01:34:15,870
She also said that when she disappeared,

1302
01:34:16,207 --> 01:34:17,970
her mother was having
an affair with dad.

1303
01:34:25,249 --> 01:34:26,910
Do you know anything about that?

1304
01:34:28,586 --> 01:34:29,553
No...

1305
01:34:31,522 --> 01:34:34,457
Well, mom told me, after...

1306
01:34:37,161 --> 01:34:38,423
After what?

1307
01:34:38,796 --> 01:34:41,162
After... she found out.

1308
01:34:44,936 --> 01:34:46,130
Look at me.

1309
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:52,002
Are there things I should know and don't?

1310
01:34:53,011 --> 01:34:54,273
Oodles.

1311
01:34:55,713 --> 01:34:56,907
But if I tell you

1312
01:34:57,315 --> 01:34:59,374
you'll be annoyed
or you won't believe me.

1313
01:35:00,618 --> 01:35:03,018
I promise I'll believe you
and I won't be annoyed.

1314
01:35:05,156 --> 01:35:07,522
Mom's been appearing all the time.

1315
01:35:09,894 --> 01:35:11,088
To whom?

1316
01:35:11,362 --> 01:35:12,386
Sit down.

1317
01:35:18,669 --> 01:35:20,762
She was with Aunt Paula until she died.

1318
01:35:21,606 --> 01:35:23,597
It was she who called Agustina

1319
01:35:23,808 --> 01:35:26,368
and opened the door
so she could find the body.

1320
01:35:26,577 --> 01:35:30,308
It was she who put out the money
so they'd bring her bread

1321
01:35:31,149 --> 01:35:33,674
and who left everything paid
for the funeral.

1322
01:35:35,486 --> 01:35:37,283
Did Agustina tell you all that?

1323
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:40,721
You don't believe me.

1324
01:35:43,027 --> 01:35:44,927
Agustina is crazy!

1325
01:35:46,297 --> 01:35:47,821
Last time we saw Auntie

1326
01:35:48,032 --> 01:35:50,830
you said yourself it was incredible

1327
01:35:51,035 --> 01:35:54,664
that she could live like that,
with her mind gone and half blind.

1328
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:56,165
Remember?

1329
01:35:56,741 --> 01:35:58,902
Yes, I do, but what are you saying?

1330
01:35:59,844 --> 01:36:01,607
That she wasn't alone.

1331
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:06,245
Who do you think made the wafers
and put them in tupperwares,

1332
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:08,146
one for each of us?

1333
01:36:09,087 --> 01:36:11,920
Who do you think took the dolls
and Auntie's valuables

1334
01:36:12,056 --> 01:36:14,320
before the neighbors swiped everything?

1335
01:36:14,926 --> 01:36:16,291
Now do you understand?

1336
01:36:21,032 --> 01:36:22,226
Have you seen her?

1337
01:36:22,934 --> 01:36:23,866
Yes.

1338
01:36:28,873 --> 01:36:30,568
Is she, by any chance,

1339
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:32,066
the Russian?

1340
01:36:33,277 --> 01:36:34,266
Yes.

1341
01:36:36,214 --> 01:36:37,511
Where is she?

1342
01:36:40,952 --> 01:36:42,146
In there.

1343
01:37:11,249 --> 01:37:12,341
Mom!

1344
01:37:13,451 --> 01:37:14,884
What are you doing down there?

1345
01:37:37,975 --> 01:37:39,533
Weren't you dead?

1346
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:42,903
I've come back to ask you to forgive me.

1347
01:37:44,882 --> 01:37:46,679
I knew nothing about it.

1348
01:37:48,252 --> 01:37:49,913
I never even imagined it.

1349
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:56,115
Come on, Paula!

1350
01:38:11,742 --> 01:38:15,303
My little girl!

1351
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:18,448
The worst is over.

1352
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:20,645
She's seen me

1353
01:38:21,319 --> 01:38:23,116
and she didn't reject me, did she?

1354
01:38:23,454 --> 01:38:24,478
No.

1355
01:38:26,524 --> 01:38:28,685
Did you really come back
to ask her to forgive you?

1356
01:38:29,994 --> 01:38:31,962
And also to be with you.

1357
01:38:33,864 --> 01:38:35,957
Some day you can explain it all to me.

1358
01:38:36,534 --> 01:38:40,698
Yes, and that day
I hope you understand me

1359
01:38:42,073 --> 01:38:43,938
and that you forgive me too.

1360
01:39:11,269 --> 01:39:12,827
I have to talk to her.

1361
01:39:13,938 --> 01:39:15,496
Why don't we go back?

1362
01:39:18,976 --> 01:39:20,068
Now?

1363
01:39:20,611 --> 01:39:21,669
Sure.

1364
01:39:49,006 --> 01:39:52,032
- I've dreamed about this so often.
- So have I.

1365
01:39:54,779 --> 01:39:56,144
I don't know where to begin.

1366
01:39:57,548 --> 01:40:01,006
You're not a ghost, are you?
You're not dead.

1367
01:40:01,519 --> 01:40:03,043
No, love, I'm not.

1368
01:40:04,221 --> 01:40:05,745
That's such a relief.

1369
01:40:06,724 --> 01:40:08,021
But even if I had died,

1370
01:40:08,859 --> 01:40:11,453
I'd have come back
to ask you to forgive me

1371
01:40:11,662 --> 01:40:13,152
for not seeing what was going on.

1372
01:40:14,332 --> 01:40:15,594
I was blind.

1373
01:40:16,834 --> 01:40:18,802
I found out the day of the fire.

1374
01:40:19,904 --> 01:40:21,496
Had you really left dad?

1375
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:23,370
Yes.

1376
01:40:24,408 --> 01:40:25,932
I couldn't stand his cheating.

1377
01:40:27,712 --> 01:40:29,145
The afternoon of the fire

1378
01:40:29,814 --> 01:40:32,544
you rang and spoke to Auntie.

1379
01:40:33,517 --> 01:40:35,849
As usual, you didn't ask for me.

1380
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:39,912
I got angry and told your aunt
you were heartless.

1381
01:40:40,825 --> 01:40:42,725
As I kept badmouthing you,

1382
01:40:43,894 --> 01:40:45,259
your aunt

1383
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,657
defended you

1384
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,992
and told me everything.

1385
01:40:56,941 --> 01:40:59,034
That your father had abused you,

1386
01:41:00,811 --> 01:41:02,540
that you'd got pregnant,

1387
01:41:03,714 --> 01:41:05,204
and that Paula

1388
01:41:05,783 --> 01:41:07,114
is your daughter

1389
01:41:07,718 --> 01:41:09,117
and your sister.

1390
01:41:11,222 --> 01:41:13,156
I couldn't believe it.

1391
01:41:14,225 --> 01:41:16,625
How could such a monstrous thing
happen in front of me

1392
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:19,125
without me realizing it?

1393
01:41:21,766 --> 01:41:24,667
Then, I understood everything.

1394
01:41:25,903 --> 01:41:27,632
I understood your silence

1395
01:41:28,305 --> 01:41:30,034
and why you grew so distant.

1396
01:41:31,142 --> 01:41:34,839
I understood why your father
went to Venezuela.

1397
01:41:35,513 --> 01:41:38,141
He couldn't cope with the shame
of what he'd done.

1398
01:41:40,017 --> 01:41:41,382
I understood

1399
01:41:42,019 --> 01:41:44,112
why, after marrying Paco,

1400
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:46,212
you went to Madrid

1401
01:41:47,057 --> 01:41:49,525
and wanted nothing to do with us.

1402
01:41:49,894 --> 01:41:52,727
I hated you for not noticing anything.

1403
01:41:53,397 --> 01:41:55,456
And you were right, love.

1404
01:41:56,867 --> 01:41:58,266
When I found out,

1405
01:41:58,803 --> 01:42:00,430
I was like a wild thing.

1406
01:42:02,306 --> 01:42:05,036
I went to the hut,
ready to scratch his eyes out!

1407
01:42:05,376 --> 01:42:08,368
I found him asleep
with Agustina's mother,

1408
01:42:08,646 --> 01:42:10,443
both of them worn out.

1409
01:42:10,815 --> 01:42:12,476
They didn't see me.

1410
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,013
I set fire to the hut.

1411
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:17,510
It was a windy day

1412
01:42:18,022 --> 01:42:21,219
and in no time the flames
had devoured everything.

1413
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:24,059
They didn't have time to wake up.

1414
01:42:26,096 --> 01:42:28,189
The ashes in your grave

1415
01:42:28,766 --> 01:42:30,529
are those of Agustina's mother?

1416
01:42:31,836 --> 01:42:32,803
Yes.

1417
01:42:37,308 --> 01:42:38,366
Afterwards,

1418
01:42:39,643 --> 01:42:42,578
I wandered the countryside for a few days,

1419
01:42:43,647 --> 01:42:44,909
hiding,

1420
01:42:45,549 --> 01:42:46,948
like an animal.

1421
01:42:48,185 --> 01:42:49,982
I was going to give myself up

1422
01:42:50,688 --> 01:42:51,950
but first

1423
01:42:52,256 --> 01:42:54,850
I went to Paula's house to see her.

1424
01:42:56,227 --> 01:42:57,990
She was in a terrible state.

1425
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:01,197
When she saw me

1426
01:43:01,465 --> 01:43:03,126
she wasn't at all surprised.

1427
01:43:04,335 --> 01:43:07,668
I came from the past,
where she was living.

1428
01:43:08,706 --> 01:43:12,437
She greeted me
as if I had just gone out the door.

1429
01:43:14,011 --> 01:43:17,310
With the tragedy,
she lost what little reason she had.

1430
01:43:18,315 --> 01:43:20,078
I couldn't leave her on her own,

1431
01:43:21,151 --> 01:43:24,348
so I stayed and looked after her

1432
01:43:25,556 --> 01:43:27,023
until she died.

1433
01:43:31,362 --> 01:43:33,922
In the village they think you're a ghost.

1434
01:43:34,565 --> 01:43:37,159
That's the good thing
about such superstitious places.

1435
01:43:37,635 --> 01:43:40,934
It was easier for me
to go along with them

1436
01:43:41,138 --> 01:43:42,537
than to speak the truth.

1437
01:43:43,507 --> 01:43:45,372
I thought I'd be arrested.

1438
01:43:46,043 --> 01:43:49,206
I never imagined
that no one would investigate

1439
01:43:49,513 --> 01:43:51,037
or punish me,

1440
01:43:51,882 --> 01:43:54,442
although all this time

1441
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:57,644
I swear I've been in a living purgatory.

1442
01:44:03,127 --> 01:44:04,594
Never better said.

1443
01:44:25,316 --> 01:44:27,011
It's too early to go to the village.

1444
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:28,917
We shouldn't arrive in daylight.

1445
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:31,119
Why don't we drive by the river?

1446
01:44:31,889 --> 01:44:33,447
It's been so long since I saw it.

1447
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:36,449
It's not what it was. It's dry.

1448
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,057
How do you know?

1449
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:42,164
Because there's a drought
all over Spain.

1450
01:44:42,366 --> 01:44:43,628
Don't you know?

1451
01:45:03,454 --> 01:45:07,049
We used to come here for picnics.
Remember, Raimunda?

1452
01:45:07,524 --> 01:45:08,388
Yes.

1453
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,255
There was more water then.

1454
01:45:11,795 --> 01:45:13,319
I told you it was dry.

1455
01:45:14,064 --> 01:45:15,292
Shall we eat something?

1456
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:16,996
Not for me.

1457
01:45:17,868 --> 01:45:20,393
- I'm going to eat a wafer.
- Me too.

1458
01:45:31,281 --> 01:45:33,476
This was your father's favorite place.

1459
01:45:34,718 --> 01:45:35,616
Paco's?

1460
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,678
Yes.

1461
01:45:39,657 --> 01:45:41,522
It was the only thing he missed.

1462
01:45:42,292 --> 01:45:43,418
This river.

1463
01:46:04,048 --> 01:46:06,107
I'm glad he's resting here.

1464
01:46:36,547 --> 01:46:38,071
If Paula were alive

1465
01:46:38,882 --> 01:46:40,213
and could see us now,

1466
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:42,584
all together...

1467
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,853
She'd be so happy.

1468
01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:54,187
Have you always had such a big chest?

1469
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:57,299
Yes, since I was little.

1470
01:46:57,668 --> 01:47:00,000
I remembered you having less.

1471
01:47:01,338 --> 01:47:02,828
Have you had anything done?

1472
01:47:03,173 --> 01:47:05,334
No! What a thing to say!

1473
01:47:05,943 --> 01:47:07,035
All right.

1474
01:47:07,311 --> 01:47:09,279
Grandma, did you ride the bike?

1475
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:11,538
Yes, half an hour every day.

1476
01:47:11,882 --> 01:47:13,679
It's good for blood pressure
and the heart.

1477
01:47:13,884 --> 01:47:15,749
What did Aunt Paula say?

1478
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:18,515
She roared laughing.

1479
01:47:22,192 --> 01:47:23,216
'Bye.

1480
01:47:26,597 --> 01:47:27,996
It's Aunt Paula...

1481
01:47:28,265 --> 01:47:29,459
Don't start.

1482
01:47:30,567 --> 01:47:31,693
I'll get it.

1483
01:47:32,936 --> 01:47:35,029
Hide mom's plate and cutlery.

1484
01:47:41,211 --> 01:47:43,441
- Who is it?
- Agustina.

1485
01:47:47,518 --> 01:47:49,281
We're having supper.

1486
01:47:49,753 --> 01:47:51,448
I'm sorry to bother you.

1487
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:53,887
Don't stay out there.

1488
01:47:54,725 --> 01:47:55,714
Thank you.

1489
01:48:01,098 --> 01:48:03,658
Good evening.

1490
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:06,026
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1491
01:48:13,343 --> 01:48:16,176
I came to apologize about the show.

1492
01:48:16,947 --> 01:48:19,745
You shouldn't have done it.
It wasn't right.

1493
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:21,310
I know that.

1494
01:48:21,552 --> 01:48:23,110
It's no excuse,

1495
01:48:23,587 --> 01:48:25,316
but they offered
to take me to Houston.

1496
01:48:25,556 --> 01:48:27,148
They cure everything there.

1497
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:29,424
But I couldn't do it.

1498
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:32,995
I'd rather die alone in my house,
but at peace,

1499
01:48:33,597 --> 01:48:35,292
and able to look you in the eye.

1500
01:48:37,968 --> 01:48:41,404
- Mom, I'm going to bed, all right?
- Yes, go on.

1501
01:48:43,574 --> 01:48:45,940
- Will you have some supper?
- No, thanks.

1502
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:49,473
I heard you're going to sell the house.

1503
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,478
We'd thought about it
but now we're here...

1504
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:55,274
There are so many memories.

1505
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,845
Well, I have to go.

1506
01:48:59,556 --> 01:49:01,683
Why don't you stay a while?

1507
01:49:02,192 --> 01:49:05,252
I have to go to the nurse
to get my injection.

1508
01:49:05,863 --> 01:49:08,593
In Madrid they told me
to learn to do it myself

1509
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:10,630
but it gives me the creeps!

1510
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:15,198
Your sister is unforgivable.
Leaving you alone like this.

1511
01:49:15,405 --> 01:49:16,702
Don't even mention her.

1512
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:20,366
As I didn't say what they wanted
on television

1513
01:49:20,711 --> 01:49:22,110
she's not speaking to me.

1514
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:25,980
She's very angry with me.
But I'm even angrier with her.

1515
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:27,981
With good reason.

1516
01:49:28,285 --> 01:49:29,718
I envy you two.

1517
01:49:31,154 --> 01:49:32,587
You're so close.

1518
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:54,638
Irene!

1519
01:49:56,647 --> 01:49:58,478
I've longed to see you.

1520
01:49:58,715 --> 01:49:59,841
Here I am.

1521
01:50:00,918 --> 01:50:02,476
I heard about your problem

1522
01:50:03,153 --> 01:50:05,621
and I can imagine how lonely you are.

1523
01:50:06,023 --> 01:50:07,115
Very lonely.

1524
01:50:11,295 --> 01:50:13,263
If only Paula were here...

1525
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,791
I'm here to look after you.

1526
01:50:16,667 --> 01:50:18,157
You left the door open.

1527
01:50:18,769 --> 01:50:20,862
Don't worry, I closed it.

1528
01:50:21,638 --> 01:50:22,798
Did you go to the nurse?

1529
01:50:23,006 --> 01:50:25,304
No, I'm very tired. Tomorrow.

1530
01:50:26,043 --> 01:50:28,443
Tomorrow you'll be in a lot of pain.

1531
01:50:28,912 --> 01:50:31,380
Have you got the medicine
and the needles?

1532
01:50:31,581 --> 01:50:33,344
Yes, I bought it all in Madrid.

1533
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,745
Good, I'll give you the injection.

1534
01:50:41,925 --> 01:50:43,654
I was born in this bed.

1535
01:50:45,395 --> 01:50:47,386
My mother slept here.

1536
01:50:48,665 --> 01:50:51,600
And in this bed
we held your sister Paula's wake.

1537
01:50:52,336 --> 01:50:53,598
I know,

1538
01:50:54,604 --> 01:50:56,231
and I'm so grateful.

1539
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:03,209
We have to talk, Irene.

1540
01:51:03,981 --> 01:51:05,676
About everything you want.

1541
01:51:06,483 --> 01:51:08,576
But don't tell anyone I've come back.

1542
01:51:08,819 --> 01:51:11,049
Don't worry.

1543
01:51:13,156 --> 01:51:15,681
Thank you for not talking
about me on television.

1544
01:51:17,394 --> 01:51:19,521
It's our own business.

1545
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:21,894
That's right,

1546
01:51:22,232 --> 01:51:24,063
and no one else's.

1547
01:52:32,302 --> 01:52:34,896
Mom, it's me, let me in!

1548
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:38,771
What are you doing here? Come in!

1549
01:52:40,977 --> 01:52:42,376
I missed you.

1550
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:46,206
- Are you going to stay here?
- Yes, until the end.

1551
01:52:46,716 --> 01:52:48,240
Agustina is very ill.

1552
01:52:48,885 --> 01:52:50,216
After what I did to her mother,

1553
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:53,116
the least I can do
is look after her until she dies.

1554
01:52:54,724 --> 01:52:56,817
I have so much to tell you.

1555
01:52:57,027 --> 01:52:59,427
I haven't told you about Paco
or what I've done.

1556
01:52:59,629 --> 01:53:02,826
I'm dying to hear everything,
but go away now.

1557
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:06,531
I'll see you every day.
Between us we'll manage.

1558
01:53:06,736 --> 01:53:07,828
Yes.

1559
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:12,435
I need you, mom.

1560
01:53:15,245 --> 01:53:17,713
I don't know how I lived
all these years without you.

1561
01:53:18,815 --> 01:53:20,146
Don't say that.

1562
01:53:21,084 --> 01:53:22,381
I'll start to cry

1563
01:53:23,353 --> 01:53:25,685
and ghosts don't cry.
