1
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,958
Put some stones in the vase
or it'll fall over.

2
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,325
This bloody wind!

3
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,471
Polish the letters well.

4
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,571
There are so many widows!

5
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,573
The women here
live longer than the men.

6
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,676
- Except poor Mom.
- Mom was lucky.

7
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,439
Raimunda, don't say that!

8
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,741
She died in dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

9
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,180
Burned to death!

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,647
That's the worst way to die.

11
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,189
They were asleep.

12
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,716
They didn't even realize.

13
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,761
Even so, how can you say
something like that!

14
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,970
Hello.

15
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,207
- Is that everything, Mom?
- I'll get the rest.

16
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,835
This is wonderful!

17
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,136
Good Lord!

18
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,906
- Is this Paula?
- Of course.

19
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,241
She's all grown up!

20
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,542
Give her a kiss.

21
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,346
She's got your father's eyes.

22
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,014
- How are you?
- Not good.

23
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,316
Don't say that.

24
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,055
I want to give my grave the once- over.

25
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,591
With this wind, you can't keep it clean.

26
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:48,597
- It looks lovely.
- Cleaning it relaxes me.

27
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,994
I often come and sit here on my own,
and time goes by.

28
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,134
We're going now,
we have to see Aunt Paula.

29
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,200
- Come and see me afterwards.
- Sure.

30
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,641
How's Paco?

31
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,547
He's fine, he stayed
in Madrid, working.

32
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,117
Mom,

33
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,155
does Agustina really come
and clean her own grave?

34
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,948
Yes, it's the custom here.

35
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,826
They buy a plot
and look after it all their lives,

36
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,086
like a second home.

37
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,157
- That freaks me out!
- It's tradition here.

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,800
- Shall I drive?
- Yes.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,388
Aunt Paula!

40
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,392
Who is it?

41
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,529
Raimunda!

42
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,291
- Don't take all day.
- Don't rush me.

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,058
I don't like going back
in the dark.

44
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,632
Be nice to Auntie, don't laugh at her.

45
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,272
- All right.
- This house still smells of Mom.

46
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,173
How are you, Aunt?

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,880
You're very thin!
Have you had the baby?

48
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,175
- Fourteen years ago.
- Doesn't time fly!

49
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,282
And who are these?

50
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,045
Who do you think?
Sole and my Paula!

51
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,380
The same name as me!

52
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,818
And Sole.

53
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,720
Shall we go into the dining room?

54
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,195
That Sole looks like a right sourpuss.

55
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,699
For Heaven's sake!

56
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,198
...the wind carried
the cinders to the bushes.

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,706
The result is the most tragic fire
in the last 13 years.

58
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,943
- Mind if I turn it off?
- No, I can't see it anyway.

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,177
Fires are dreadful.

60
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,316
That's how your grandparents died.

61
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,387
- Why did I come in here?
- I don't know.

62
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,251
To talk?

63
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,660
- To get some food?
- Yes!

64
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,395
Look in the sideboard.

65
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,133
I'm very shaky on my pins.

66
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,704
Look, wafers!

67
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,903
Just like mom's.
Eat up.

68
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,737
How was the cemetery?

69
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,276
Your mother is delighted.

70
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,043
Did you scrub the headstone properly?

71
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,445
Of course.

72
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,681
She likes it to be clean.

73
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,118
If she could, she'd clean it herself.

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,882
But, of course, she can't.

75
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,518
Of course, she can't.

76
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,724
Don't you feel lonely
in this big house?

77
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,895
You'd be better off in a home,
where you'd be looked after.

78
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,032
I'm fine as I am.

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,874
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Well, go!

80
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,508
You can't live on your own.
I'm worried about you.

81
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,543
How do you manage your meals?

82
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:51,442
Very well.

83
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,916
Agustina brings me bread,
your mother does the cooking

84
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,487
and if I need anything
I call the store and they bring it...

85
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,825
I'm fine.

86
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,430
What a lovely touch!

87
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,039
Look!

88
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,175
It's got your name on it.

89
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:56,872
Shall we go?

90
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:58,915
Yes.

91
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,612
We're leaving now.

92
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,755
I'm so shaky on my pins.

93
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,188
- Don't get up.
- How could I not get up?

94
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,997
Next time I come back,
I'm taking you home with me.

95
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,960
Yes, next time.

96
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,529
What matters is that you come back.

97
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,864
You've gotten very wobbly.

98
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,593
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

99
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,765
Mind how you go!

100
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,403
We'll do that. I love you lots!

101
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,938
- Shall we go to Agustina's?
- Yes.

102
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,049
Come in!

103
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,850
Well?

104
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,585
- How did you find your aunt?
- Bad.

105
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,725
Terrible.

106
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,226
She's gotten very shaky.
I don't know how she copes.

107
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,592
he does very well
without going outside.

108
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,858
She eats a stick of bread every day.
She leaves the money for me.

109
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,796
Let's go onto the patio.

110
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,365
She's in an awful state, love.

111
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,597
She doesn't know what year it is.

112
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,642
She talks about mom
as if she were still alive.

113
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,908
For her, she isn't dead.

114
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,945
She can't accept it.

115
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,983
Sit down for a while.

116
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,887
I'd like to pay you something
to look in on her every day.

117
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,217
I won't accept anything!
I'm very happy to do it.

118
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,121
I'd take her home,

119
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,456
but I'd have to throw
my husband out to make room.

120
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,029
But we have to do something.

121
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,100
Every morning, before I go shopping,
I tap on her window

122
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,931
and I don't move until she answers me.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,400
I keep an eye on her.

124
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,906
I really appreciate that.

125
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,276
I like to think...

126
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,807
someone's doing that for my mother,

127
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,711
wherever she is.

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,953
Look! Wasn't she cutting edge then?

129
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,122
The only hippie in the village.

130
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,495
Look at her plastic jewelry.

131
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,900
- They're awesome!
- First- rate plastic.

132
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,039
Every time I smoke a joint
I think of her.

133
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,307
That's a fine example
you're setting for Paula!

134
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,878
- There's still no news?
- Nothing.

135
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,284
It's like the earth swallowed her up.

136
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,053
- And your sister Brigida?
- Her?

137
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,726
She's in Madrid,
she's a big hit on trash TV.

138
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,927
Mom, I'm out of credit!

139
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,901
Good, we'll get a break
from the telephone.

140
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,536
- You can use mine.
- She'll bankrupt you.

141
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,865
In that case, no.

142
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,598
As I was saying,
Brigida is on so many shows

143
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,506
she can put a deposit
on an apartment in Madrid.

144
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,112
And she's going to make a record.

145
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,545
- She always liked singing.
- So did this one.

146
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,785
Remember when you and she,

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,849
you must've been thirteen,

148
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,920
went to an audition for child singers?

149
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,183
Hey, you never told me that!

150
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,796
It was your granny's idea.
She was up for anything.

151
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,322
Talking of mothers,
maybe yours hasn't shown up

152
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,023
so as not to ruin
your sister's career.

153
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,529
Mom would love to be on television.

154
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,269
She'd go crazy.

155
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,636
Want some?

156
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,139
I grow it myself. Look at the plants.

157
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,149
We have to leave.

158
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,087
Did you report her disappearance
to the police?

159
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,620
Brigida thinks it isn't necessary.

160
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,554
She's said it so often on TV.

161
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,892
Yes, but you have to report it
to the police, not say it on TV.

162
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,926
I don't know.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,967
In any case, it's not
the first time she's left home.

164
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,299
But never for so long.

165
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,366
It's been over three years.

166
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,276
Don't give up hope.

167
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,910
And take care of yourself,
you don't look well.

168
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,610
Your oleander looks wonderful.

169
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:28,082
Yes, it didn't get aphids this year.
But I've really lost my appetite.

170
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,752
Maybe it's the joints.

171
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,254
No, if it weren't for them,
I wouldn't eat at all.

172
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,061
Your father's eyes.

173
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,159
A joint makes me feel a bit hungry
and it relaxes me.

174
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,103
Safe journey!

175
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,891
Guess what I saw upstairs
beside the bathroom!

176
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,658
What?

177
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,963
- An exercise bike.
- That freaks me out!

178
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,135
Why would auntie want a bike
if she can't walk?

179
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,764
Exactly, she's lost her mind.

180
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,304
Don't talk like that about her.

181
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,938
She didn't even recognize us.

182
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,772
It's the wind.

183
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,013
That goddamn East wind here
drives people crazy!

184
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,277
The wafers are delicious.

185
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,847
How can she bake those
when she's as blind as a bat?

186
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,708
Hello, Regina.

187
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,584
- Going to work?
- Got no choice, love.

188
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,786
- Why not give her a lift?
- Where are you going?

189
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,185
To the club. If you drop me
in the center that'd be great.

190
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,951
- All right.
- Thanks.

191
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,387
See you later.

192
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,412
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

193
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,638
Hello.

194
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,355
Well?

195
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,651
Did you have fun?

196
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,889
In the cemetery?
You kidding me?

197
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:59,161
- Were you having a party?
- Me? What do you mean?

198
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,100
Paula, sit properly. Close your legs!

199
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,838
Will you bring me another beer?

200
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,071
Are you kidding?

201
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,741
Go on, please.

202
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,254
Haven't you had enough?
You have to work tomorrow.

203
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,520
I'm free tomorrow, and the day after too.

204
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,695
How come?

205
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,724
I was fired.

206
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,391
Hang on.

207
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,133
Christ Almighty!

208
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,432
I'll get a job on Sundays,
it's my only free day.

209
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,673
I'll get a job, but let me
watch the game in peace.

210
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,117
You can forget about soccer.
There'll be no more cable.

211
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,181
We're a poor family
and we'll live like one.

212
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,489
Paula, put that phone down!

213
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,252
Your supper's here if you want it.

214
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,418
Are you angry?

215
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,523
I'm worried about my aunt.

216
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,866
She's worse than ever.

217
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,067
She didn't even recognize
Paula and Sole.

218
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,709
- I don't know how she manages.
- But she does.

219
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,943
Leave me be.

220
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,308
What's wrong?

221
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,849
I'm worn out and I have to get up early.

222
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,920
I'll do the work.

223
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,417
Don't be a pest!

224
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,761
Don't call me a pest.

225
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,732
Sorry.

226
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,017
What are you doing here?

227
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,990
- Waiting for you.
- What for?

228
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,635
I called to tell you to buy bread.
you loads of times

229
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,268
I don't suppose you
thought to buy any.

230
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,265
You're soaked.
How long have you been here?

231
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,910
A while.

232
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,316
Where were you? With your pals?

233
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,713
I wasn't anywhere.

234
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,184
Why didn't you answer the phone?

235
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,818
What's wrong?

236
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,694
Is something wrong?

237
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,335
Tell me, what's happened?

238
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,710
Where's your father?

239
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,648
He's...

240
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,747
Where?

241
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,020
In the kitchen.

242
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,333
What happened?

243
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,274
I was in the kitchen,
with my back to him

244
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,374
and suddenly dad jumped on me.

245
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,971
He was drunk.

246
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,243
I asked him what he was doing
and he said he wasn't my father.

247
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,885
I pushed him away.

248
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,484
But he got up
and put his arms around me.

249
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,258
I pushed him again.

250
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,701
He unzipped his pants.

251
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,966
He kept saying that it wasn't wrong

252
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,605
and that he wasn't my father!

253
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,785
I took a knife from the drawer

254
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,613
and I threatened him

255
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,252
but it was only to scare him.

256
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,226
He didn't believe me.

257
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,261
He said I wouldn't dare

258
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,326
and he jumped on me.

259
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,943
What are you going to do?

260
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,711
I don't know.

261
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,322
Go and change, or you'll get pneumonia.

262
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,159
Remember, I killed him

263
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:38,302
and you saw nothing, you weren't here.

264
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,365
It's very important you remember that.

265
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,214
Don't open!

266
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,641
Who can it be?

267
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:32,984
I don't know.

268
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,519
Go to your room.

269
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,612
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

270
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,586
Coming!

271
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,359
Hi there.

272
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,696
I'm sorry, I know it's late,
but I'm going to Barcelona tomorrow.

273
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,535
I want to give you the restaurant keys
in case anyone comes to see it.

274
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,706
I don't mind, It's just I'm never at home.

275
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,075
What about Paco? He's always here.

276
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,676
Paco...

277
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,417
He finally got a job.
He's starting tomorrow.

278
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,182
Are you hurt?

279
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,792
Women's troubles.

280
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,629
But now that I think about it,

281
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,763
with Paco working
I'll have more free time.

282
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,962
- Give me the keys, I'll sort it out.
- Here.

283
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,002
This is my brother's home number.

284
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,764
The other is my cellphone.

285
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,944
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- In the morning.

286
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,844
Tell me, how much are you asking?
I always liked your restaurant.

287
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,280
It's a pity you didn't like
the owner too.

288
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,083
Emilio, please...

289
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,315
For the lease, five million,
but it's negotiable.

290
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,590
We'll miss you.

291
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,321
And I'll miss you girls.

292
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,960
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

293
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,165
- Is Emilio leaving?
- Yes.

294
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:10,003
- Go back to your room.
- I want to be with you.

295
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,354
You'll have to help me later.

296
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,419
Don't answer!

297
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,888
It'll be one of your pals.

298
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,060
Answer it, tell them you can't talk.

299
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,837
This is no time to be calling.

300
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,669
I can't talk...

301
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,346
What do you mean? It's your Aunt Sole.

302
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,274
Put your mother on.

303
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,743
It's Aunt Sole.

304
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,546
Tell her I'm busy.

305
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,611
She's busy now.

306
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,653
Put her on, it's important.

307
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,982
Take the phone, Mom.

308
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,591
Sole, I've got a pile of ironing

309
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,631
and I was out working all afternoon.

310
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,063
Agustina rang.

311
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,161
Aunt Paula is dead.

312
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,003
- When?
- A little while ago.

313
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,743
Aunt Paula is dead.

314
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,284
Just a minute ago I was thinking
of bringing her here.

315
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,152
She died all alone!

316
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,724
Don't cry, pet.

317
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,721
Listen, Agustina said
we're not to worry.

318
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,695
She and Squinty will lay her out
before we get there.

319
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,165
Auntie had everything organized.

320
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,339
She even chose her coffin
and paid for everything.

321
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,568
It's incredible that
she was so lucid at the end.

322
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,976
I can't go to the funeral.

323
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,742
I'm truly sorry,

324
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:51,981
but I'm very busy.

325
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,811
How can you not go!
What will people say!

326
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,011
I can't go, not remotely.

327
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,651
You have to go on your own.

328
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,951
On my own?

329
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:06,288
No way. You know
I'm terrified of the dead.

330
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,394
But you needn't see Auntie.

331
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,691
I'll tell Agustina to make sure of that.

332
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,199
And if they ask for you?

333
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,869
Say I've had a gallbladder
operation... anything.

334
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,608
I'll go later, but today
it's not remotely possible.

335
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,414
I don't understand you.
Auntie loved you so much.

336
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,041
And I loved her.

337
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:30,385
I'll explain it to you some day,
and that day, you'll flip.

338
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,954
I'm flipping now.

339
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,283
Take a tranquilizer,
I'm going to take one too.

340
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,586
And you go tomorrow morning.

341
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,026
All right?

342
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,357
I guess...

343
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,885
The door!

344
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,238
Wait!

345
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,039
You stay here.
Stay here and keep watch.

346
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,610
I hope it hasn't changed
since I worked here.

347
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,548
DEEP FREEZE

348
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,924
Stay where you are!

349
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,819
Sorry.

350
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,563
What do you want?

351
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,663
Is the restaurant open?

352
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,193
Why?

353
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,265
Give me a hand.

354
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,199
We're shooting a film in the area

355
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,706
and I'm looking for somewhere
we can all eat.

356
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,511
Do you know
any restaurants around here?

357
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,150
How many are you?

358
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,618
25 and 5... 30.

359
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,583
Come on, help me.

360
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,499
I can do it for you, if you want.
We were going to close today.

361
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,591
So, lunch for thirty.

362
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:13,996
At what time?

363
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,699
We stop at 3:30, and we're very close.

364
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,309
- Around 4:00?
- Yeah.

365
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,144
And, tell me, how much...?

366
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,810
Ten euros a head.

367
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,875
That's fine.

368
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:35,153
I'm sorry I shouted at you,
but you scared me.

369
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,863
- Well, I'll see you at 4:00.
- Sure.

370
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,463
Thanks a lot.

371
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,996
It's 10:00!

372
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,839
- Two kilos.
- Give me another two kilos.

373
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,803
How much are the potatoes?

374
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,176
1.60 for four kilos.

375
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,148
- Give me eight kilos.
- Sure.

376
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,447
Hello, Regina.

377
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,092
Hello, you're carting quite a load!

378
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,126
I have to make lunch for 30.

379
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,762
- Could you lend me 100 euros?
- I'm broke, love.

380
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,833
I've just bought
a chunk of pork this big.

381
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,471
I could use that. I'll buy it from you.

382
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,667
It cost me 10.80, It's all I have!

383
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,036
I'll pay you tomorrow. Come on!

384
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,101
I'll bring it over to you now.

385
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,213
- Thanks, love.
- I'll have to diet today.

386
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,814
It'll do you good.

387
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,313
Hey, Ines! Back from the village?

388
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,352
I got here yesterday. How are you?

389
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,494
Did you happen to bring
any sausages or chorizo?

390
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,157
I certainly did! The sausages are great.

391
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,357
My mother-in-law orders them
specially for me.

392
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,900
- I need a kilo or so.
- Why's that?

393
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,698
- I have to cook for 30.
- Who's coming?

394
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,534
I'll tell you later.

395
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,967
Can I buy them? I'll pay you tomorrow.

396
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,872
- Sure, it's no problem.
- Thanks.

397
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,345
Did you bring anything sweet?

398
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,645
I brought some cookies
that melt in your mouth.

399
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,481
With the way your glucose
and cholesterol are,

400
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,486
I can't believe you brought cookies.

401
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,717
It's my only vice. Three boxes.

402
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,223
You shouldn't eat them.

403
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,489
- What do I do, give them away?
- Sell them to me.

404
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,633
At least let me taste them.

405
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,396
You can eat three or four
but don't stuff yourself.

406
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,470
- Bring them round to me, love.
- I'll do that.

407
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,164
Thanks.

408
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,843
Bye, pet.

409
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,458
Who'd like some pork? It's delicious.

410
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,288
You too?

411
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,536
Some pork? It's delicious.

412
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,575
Agustina?

413
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,087
Is that you?

414
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,891
Soledad,

415
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,592
daughter.

416
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,591
Sole,

417
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,998
I have to talk to you.

418
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,453
Sole!

419
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,835
There, there.

420
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,331
Take it easy.

421
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,803
Where is she?

422
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,412
Upstairs, in my mother's room,

423
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,375
the best room in the house.

424
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,943
I brought her here
to give her a better wake.

425
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,019
Thank you so much.

426
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,124
Come on, we're the principal mourners.

427
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,523
Good afternoon.

428
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,834
I spoke to your sister.
She's just had an operation.

429
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,667
Yes, what timing.

430
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,132
She said you're not to see the body.

431
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,140
Don't worry, you won't have to.

432
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,792
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

433
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,263
We'll let her rest a while,
she's very tired.

434
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,436
Come on.

435
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,937
Over here.

436
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,315
It was late at night.

437
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,047
I'd had supper and I was
watching the television.

438
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,792
I heard someone knocking at my door.

439
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,657
I wasn't sure, but just then

440
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,230
I heard the same noise,

441
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,134
and I asked, "Who is it?"

442
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,199
And a voice answered,

443
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,807
"Agustina".

444
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,143
I wasn't afraid.

445
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,745
I went outside but I saw no one.

446
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,576
I looked over at your aunt's house

447
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,754
and the door seemed to be open.

448
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,090
I thought it was odd,

449
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,490
so I went in.

450
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,058
I called your aunt

451
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,553
but she didn't answer me.

452
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,557
How could she answer me, poor thing?

453
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,035
I went into her room

454
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,798
and I found her there, in bed,

455
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,105
as still as a little bird!

456
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,177
It was her spirit that warned you.

457
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,175
But was it Paula's spirit
or the other one's?

458
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,747
One of the two.

459
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,282
I can't say who it was, I didn't see.

460
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,654
But just as I'm listening to you now,

461
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,027
someone or something
warned me that Paula had died,

462
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,126
and opened the door so I could go in.

463
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,129
Come into the kitchen.

464
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,773
I bet you haven't eaten yet.

465
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,068
No.

466
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,811
Not since last night, but I'm all right.

467
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,310
I thought as much.

468
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,351
This'll do you good.

469
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,388
Don't give me any more! That's enough.

470
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,792
What did the women mean?

471
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,169
It was just talk.

472
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,062
You know what villages are like.

473
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,301
They were talking about my mother.

474
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,442
Some people say they've seen her.

475
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,810
They say she came back
to look after your Aunt Paula.

476
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,847
Has she not appeared to you?

477
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,178
No. What about you?

478
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,947
No, but those things happen.

479
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,352
I know.

480
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,323
My grandfather, God rest him,
appeared to my grandmother.

481
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,026
At first she was frightened.

482
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:30,958
Eat up!

483
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,700
Then she asked him what he wanted

484
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,562
and his spirit told her

485
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,536
there was a promise
he hadn't fulfilled.

486
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,968
She carried it out

487
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,974
and the whole village
went with her to the cemetery

488
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,343
where they left my grandfather
so he'd rest in peace.

489
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,246
And he never appeared again.

490
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,950
That isn't just a story I heard.

491
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,888
I lived it.

492
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,326
Do you want to go
into your aunt's house

493
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,928
in case you want to take anything?

494
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,128
No, Raimunda will come later.

495
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,863
Tell her it went very well
and the whole village came.

496
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,264
I'll do that.

497
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,605
I'm going to miss her so much!

498
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,807
Go on.

499
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,116
Let me out, Sole!

500
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,821
Let me out! I'm your mother.

501
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,456
I won't do anything to you.

502
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,296
My mother is dead.

503
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,434
If you're anything,
you're her ghost or her spirit.

504
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,611
Whatever you say,
but get me out of here.

505
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,841
I'm in the trunk of your car.

506
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,841
Really, mom, the things you do!

507
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,221
Soledad,

508
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,157
daughter,

509
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,623
don't be afraid of me.

510
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,033
I'm your mother.

511
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:56,697
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

512
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,984
Now, give me a hand.

513
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:12,719
Take this.

514
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,859
- Auntie's suitcase!
- Yes.

515
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,058
What is all this?

516
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,965
Clothes, and some valuables Auntie had.

517
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,638
A good thing I hid them
before the neighbors arrived.

518
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,967
Except for Agustina,
they all went through everything,

519
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,668
but I'd got there first.

520
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,075
You'll have to give Agustina a gift,
she's been so good.

521
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,914
Better than your sister.

522
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,779
There was such a fuss
when she didn't turn up.

523
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,619
If you'd heard
what Squinty said about her!

524
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,190
Thank heavens you came.

525
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,786
I'm wrecked after the trip.

526
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,136
- Are you sleeping here?
- Yes, where do you want me to go?

527
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,262
What a sight!
I'm not surprised I scared you.

528
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,107
Do you still have the illegal hair salon?

529
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,709
That's how I make my living.

530
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,611
- Is that the guest room?
- Yes, that's it.

531
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,514
Tomorrow, you can give me
a color and a trim.

532
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,247
And I need dark glasses too.

533
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,680
I don't want to be
stuck in the house all day.

534
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,456
I have to go out.

535
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,660
Nobody knows me here.

536
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,893
In the village, I couldn't
even go to the front door.

537
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,930
I need a bit of air.

538
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,197
Are you staying for long?

539
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,809
- You want to throw me out already?
- No, I'm just asking.

540
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,447
I'll stay for as long as God wills,
if you don't mind.

541
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,614
When you tire of me,
you just have to say so.

542
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,818
But for a separated woman,

543
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,113
who's better company than her mother?

544
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,560
Unless you've got yourself a sweety-pie.

545
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,321
No, mom.

546
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,457
I'm alone, like always.

547
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,892
Not anymore.

548
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,529
Answer the phone.

549
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,466
- Are you back?
- Yes.

550
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,871
You were out of range so I rang Agustina.

551
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,635
She said it all went very well.

552
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,476
The whole village came.

553
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,080
I've been thinking about you all day.
I really wanted to be there.

554
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,451
Hang on, Sole.

555
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,249
What do I owe for the drinks?

556
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,060
They're on the house.

557
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,322
- Well, tomorrow, same time.
- Sure.

558
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,557
- The crew were very happy.
- I'm glad.

559
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,359
If you don't mind,
and even if you charge more,

560
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,903
could the helpings be more generous?

561
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,399
Tomorrow, you'll have food
coming out your eyes.

562
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,905
- Great, see you then.
- So long.

563
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,043
Sorry, Sole.

564
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,616
Have you got a job in a restaurant too?

565
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,219
Yes, I've taken over Emilio's place.

566
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,513
Good Lord!

567
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,317
He was sick of it,
but that's not the only news.

568
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,922
Paco has left us.

569
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,192
That's why I couldn't go to the funeral.

570
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,126
We were having a row when you rang.

571
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,766
I knew something was wrong.

572
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,333
Did he hit you?

573
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,735
Paco wasn't violent.

574
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,804
He's just gone,

575
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,703
forever.

576
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,068
He'll come back, you'll see.

577
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,906
I doubt it.

578
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,274
Why are you so sure?

579
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,074
You can tell these things.

580
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,817
Well, so long.

581
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:32,953
So long.

582
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,321
'Bye.

583
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,720
None of the three of us
had any luck with men.

584
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,056
Raimunda and I didn't, but you...

585
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,757
Me, what?

586
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,432
Dad adored you.

587
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,831
Raimunda says that you were lucky,

588
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,666
you died in the arms
of the person you loved most.

589
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,434
Your sister isn't a bad person
but she's got a nasty streak.

590
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,470
I was blind about him

591
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,673
and he cheated on me
until the day he died!

592
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,980
- What do you mean?
- It's true.

593
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,289
I kept that quiet all my life.
I never wanted you two to know.

594
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,052
But let's drop it. I don't want
to talk ill of the dead.

595
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,824
- Is he going to appear?
- I hope not.

596
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,126
And your husband?

597
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,195
What about him?

598
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,433
Might he turn up some day?

599
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,897
I doubt it.

600
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,204
I haven't heard from him in two years.

601
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:29,037
All the better. It'll just be
the two of us together.

602
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,793
- The pork cost you... 10?
- 10.80.

603
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,261
- I'll give you an extra 3 euros.
- Thanks, love.

604
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,839
And I'll pay you for four boxes
of cookies, not three.

605
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,209
Thanks.

606
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,934
I don't want you to think I'd cheat you.

607
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,814
Could you help me with this?
I can't move it on my own.

608
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,344
- Where are you taking it?
- To the restaurant.

609
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,746
You're the expert in removals.
Where do we...?

610
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,983
Get a hold of it,
tip it over, but not all the way.

611
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,991
- Otherwise we won't get it through.
- Is this all right?

612
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,563
Now, straighten up, to the right,
more to the right...

613
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,702
- We can't see anything.
- I'll guide you.

614
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,395
Careful, it'll come this way.

615
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,197
All the way...

616
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,398
Don't rush it.

617
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,569
Are we at the door?

618
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,846
The elevator is here.

619
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,786
Wait, wait. This has to go in straight.

620
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,579
I'll take this end.

621
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,547
You take it.

622
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:21,849
You're doing fine.

623
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,250
Good Lord! This is tough.

624
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,586
Careful!

625
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,525
Call it from downstairs.

626
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,470
I want them to see
we don't use frozen food.

627
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,866
It's all natural, fresh every day.

628
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:41,668
Over to the corner.

629
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,376
- And the other freezer?
- It's broken.

630
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,305
So you're taking over the restaurant?

631
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,183
Yes, at least until the crew
finishes the film.

632
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:51,946
Then I'll see.

633
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,417
You can count on me.
I make great desserts.

634
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,887
And I can serve drinks at night.

635
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,860
I don't know if we'll work nights,
but I'm counting on you.

636
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,657
- Sure.
- And thanks.

637
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,638
Mom...

638
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,274
Is there anything you want me to do?

639
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
Cut my hair.

640
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:19,744
I mean,

641
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,245
is there anything

642
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,448
you left undone in life

643
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,789
that won't let you rest in peace?

644
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,417
People always leave things undone,

645
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,926
or done badly,

646
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,726
and I'm no exception.

647
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,965
But I don't know if they can be fixed.

648
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,133
And if they can,

649
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,470
it's up to me to fix them.

650
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,340
My clients will be arriving soon.
What'll we do?

651
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,413
Look after them. I'll help you.

652
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:56,181
But I can't say you're my mother.
They know I'm an orphan.

653
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,955
- I'll say I'm a foreigner.
- A foreigner?

654
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,683
From where?

655
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,459
Dominican Republic?

656
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,653
No, there are lots around here,
they'd notice your accent.

657
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:10,657
Chinese?

658
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,767
- Madrid's full of Chinese.
- Who'd believe you're Chinese!

659
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,830
Something we don't have around here.

660
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,236
Russian!

661
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,941
Do I really look more
Russian than Chinese?

662
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,709
Yes, the Russians are like us.

663
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,086
Look, whatever you hear,
keep your mouth shut.

664
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,987
And don't let them see
that you understand us.

665
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,824
I'll show you how everything works.

666
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,027
In the bedroom, I cut, dry and color,

667
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,755
and here I wash their hair.

668
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,735
If the client is tall, lift this up.
If she's small, put it down.

669
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,932
This towel is to keep you from slipping.

670
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,036
And I keep this here

671
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,469
because up above it's very uncomfortable

672
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,905
and if it's down there

673
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,117
I have to bend down so often
I wreck my back.

674
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,150
I get a lot of backaches too.

675
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,614
And the shampoo is measured out.

676
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,013
Sit down.

677
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,059
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

678
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,198
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

679
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,492
I'm the same.

680
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,669
And then, with that same towel,

681
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,839
you dry her hair a bit
so it doesn't drip down her back.

682
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:28,243
It's all so well organized.
You're very smart, love.

683
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,945
Hello.

684
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,522
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian.

685
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,251
They're in a terrible state.

686
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,724
I took her in out of charity.

687
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,292
When I saw her begging in the street,

688
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,591
she reminded me of my mother.

689
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,597
Don't trust all the old women you see,

690
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,292
especially Russians.
There are lots of mafias.

691
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,529
People take advantage of you.

692
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,968
Are you getting streaks?
Sit down here.

693
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,974
Wash hair, yes.

694
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,808
- She was a hairdresser in Russia.
- How do you communicate?

695
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,877
With signs. She understands
everything. She's sharp.

696
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,846
She'll speak Spanish in no time.

697
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,285
Yes, look at all the top models
who are Russian.

698
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,617
Heavens!

699
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,822
- So, Russian?
- Russia.

700
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,467
The water,

701
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,067
not hot,

702
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,765
not cold.

703
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,577
Very good.

704
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,161
Hello.

705
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:56,063
Hey, there.

706
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,260
We have a day off tomorrow.

707
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,163
Then we'll have one too.
We need a break.

708
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,099
And we finish up next week.

709
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,569
We wanted to have the wrap party here.

710
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:08,935
Great.

711
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,073
Do you want a sit-down meal
or a buffet?

712
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,616
A buffet would be great.

713
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,147
And we'd like to have
the terrace just for us.

714
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,883
That's no problem.

715
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,452
Don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

716
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,655
Same here.

717
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,864
Go and have a drink, I'm working.

718
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,299
All right.

719
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,365
She's been strange
since she came back from the village.

720
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,068
If she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

721
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:42,705
And it's true.

722
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,805
The less you know the better.

723
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,209
And above all
don't keep thinking about it.

724
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,093
Hello.

725
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,232
- Are you with someone?
- No.

726
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,471
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- What for?

727
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,233
I'm dying to piss.

728
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,633
It's broken.
I'm waiting for the plumber.

729
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,813
I'll throw some water down,
for Christ's sake! I have to piss.

730
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,909
Hello!

731
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,685
What's wrong with you?

732
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,117
- I'm at a difficult age.
- You're not the only one.

733
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,261
- I'm going to trim your hair.
- No, I know you.

734
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,055
- Just the ends.
- Less than a centimeter.

735
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,337
Tell me,

736
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,936
has your dad not come back?

737
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,509
No. He said goodbye for good.

738
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,983
That's incredible.
I just don't understand.

739
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,777
It smells of farts!

740
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,289
What's your mother up to?

741
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:07,759
What?

742
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,728
She's such a pain!
Ever since she was a child.

743
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,328
And in those days
we didn't have a bathroom.

744
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,772
We did it in the yard.

745
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,803
We'd be waiting for her all day.

746
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,872
All day long she'd be in the yard,
with the hens.

747
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,474
This dressing gown...

748
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,483
It's Mom's.

749
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,147
I know that.

750
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,519
And the smell?

751
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,519
What smell?

752
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:13,318
In the bathroom and here.

753
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,232
It's as if Mom had just been here,
farting her ass off!

754
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,662
Don't you smell it?

755
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,802
The way she used to fart!

756
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:31,144
And she could never hide it
because she was the first to laugh!

757
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,145
It's as if I can hear her now.

758
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,223
Don't be silly!

759
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,863
Why did you bring these clothes?

760
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,996
No wonder you have nightmares.

761
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,770
You give away dead people's clothes.

762
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,168
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

763
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,762
The antique dolls!

764
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,771
Her jewel case!

765
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,739
What were you going to do with this?

766
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,448
Nothing.

767
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,514
You were going to keep it.

768
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,944
Really, Sole.

769
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,676
Don't get the wrong idea.

770
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,055
I didn't bring the case.

771
00:58:47,842 --> 00:58:49,969
Then why is it here?

772
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:55,644
When I got to Aunt Paula's house...

773
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:57,618
What?

774
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:02,019
I'd never have believed this.

775
00:59:03,424 --> 00:59:07,019
Stealing the few things she had
before she was even in the grave.

776
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,054
What a nerve!

777
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:14,562
Don't go off like that!

778
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,760
We have to buy another fridge.

779
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:52,329
Why not fix the one in the storeroom?

780
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:55,270
It doesn't work.

781
00:59:57,545 --> 00:59:58,910
The motor's making a noise.

782
01:00:00,114 --> 01:00:02,878
I said no one is to go in there,
including you.

783
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:05,381
The door was open,
I went in for a hammer.

784
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:08,220
Has anyone else been in?

785
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:09,757
I don't think so.

786
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:18,628
You said you'd got rid of him.

787
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,500
I wasn't able to.

788
01:00:21,336 --> 01:00:23,361
You think I like having him in there?

789
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:32,473
Get dressed, everyone
will be arriving soon.

790
01:00:41,456 --> 01:00:43,651
Why are you still like that?

791
01:00:44,192 --> 01:00:48,026
- I'm not in a party mood.
- Neither am I, but it's work.

792
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,921
Don't be such a lazybones.

793
01:00:51,499 --> 01:00:53,660
Come on, pet, I'll help you.

794
01:00:55,837 --> 01:00:56,997
What's wrong?

795
01:00:57,405 --> 01:01:01,307
I can't forget about it
when he's so near, in the storeroom.

796
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,577
That's the best way to go crazy,
and to drive me crazy too.

797
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:08,805
You don't know what it's like
to have killed your father.

798
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:12,176
Paco wasn't your father.

799
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,445
Don't lie to me anymore.

800
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:19,350
I know you're doing it for me,
but, please, don't lie.

801
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,891
I'm not lying.

802
01:01:21,396 --> 01:01:23,364
He recognized you as his daughter

803
01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:25,928
but he knew he wasn't
your biological father.

804
01:01:31,506 --> 01:01:33,531
So was he telling me the truth?

805
01:01:33,841 --> 01:01:34,808
Yes.

806
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,239
But that doesn't justify what he did.

807
01:01:41,582 --> 01:01:44,779
I promise I'll tell you everything
another time.

808
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:48,278
What's the point of sitting here?

809
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:50,856
Who was my father?

810
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,222
A guy in the village.

811
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:55,589
Do I know him?

812
01:01:57,532 --> 01:01:58,863
He's dead.

813
01:02:00,735 --> 01:02:02,965
I'll tell you everything.

814
01:02:03,738 --> 01:02:04,830
I swear.

815
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,634
I'll hold you to your word.

816
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:21,250
- Two mojitos!
- Coming up!

817
01:02:21,756 --> 01:02:24,520
What about you, love? Another two?

818
01:02:24,926 --> 01:02:27,554
With lemon. It's perfect.

819
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:36,100
We need more glasses.

820
01:02:36,304 --> 01:02:37,771
I can hardly keep up.

821
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:39,998
Isn't Paula looking pretty?

822
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:46,145
Here.

823
01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:47,744
Thanks.

824
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,279
How delicious!

825
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,647
I can't take any more.
They're really good.

826
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:58,189
With your cleavage and my mojitos,
we'd make a fortune.

827
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,154
We should start working nights
and try to liven up

828
01:03:02,463 --> 01:03:03,930
this lousy neighborhood.

829
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:07,464
We'll talk about that. First,
we have to keep this lot happy.

830
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:08,691
Have a mojito!

831
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,429
Keep down, they mustn't see you!

832
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:14,239
I'd like to see Raimunda and Paula.

833
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,534
The other day, I only saw their feet.

834
01:03:17,812 --> 01:03:19,211
And look at the fuss you caused!

835
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:22,315
Is that the restaurant?

836
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:27,152
She said it was going well
but I never imagined this!

837
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:28,916
She deserves it.

838
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:31,415
She's had a hard time.

839
01:03:41,269 --> 01:03:43,635
Stay in the car
and don't let anyone see you.

840
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:45,203
No one can see me here!

841
01:04:17,405 --> 01:04:18,667
What are you doing here?

842
01:04:19,607 --> 01:04:20,574
This is great!

843
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:24,609
I've brought you Aunt Paula's things.
I didn't know about the party.

844
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:27,340
It's a film crew celebrating
the end of the shoot.

845
01:04:27,548 --> 01:04:29,448
I've been catering for them.

846
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:31,608
Let's put the suitcase away.

847
01:04:32,253 --> 01:04:33,277
Why did you bother?

848
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:36,155
I'd never have kept anything of Auntie's,

849
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:37,855
much less hidden it from you.

850
01:04:38,192 --> 01:04:40,092
I know that.
I'm sorry for what I said.

851
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,319
I always shoot my mouth off.

852
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,792
Hello, Auntie.

853
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:47,697
- You want anything?
- No.

854
01:05:08,623 --> 01:05:12,957
I can see the twinkling
of the lights in the distance

855
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,685
that are marking my return.

856
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:17,397
Remember?

857
01:05:18,232 --> 01:05:19,426
How could I forget?

858
01:05:20,368 --> 01:05:22,302
It's so long since I heard you sing!

859
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,831
I've never heard her sing.

860
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:28,907
Really?

861
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,802
Really, never.

862
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:36,374
- Would you like to?
- What do you think? Of course!

863
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,388
Come on.

864
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:48,889
I can't believe it.

865
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,172
Sit there.

866
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:08,676
Be quiet!

867
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:11,214
Sit down! This woman's going to sing!

868
01:06:15,923 --> 01:06:17,185
Good evening.

869
01:06:18,192 --> 01:06:20,183
I'd like to thank the crew

870
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,988
for the work you've given us
these past weeks.

871
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:25,192
Thank you so much.

872
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,127
I haven't sung for a very long time

873
01:06:28,969 --> 01:06:31,130
but I'll do it tonight,
and see how it goes.

874
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:49,688
I'm afraid of the encounter

875
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:53,689
with the past that's coming back

876
01:06:53,894 --> 01:06:57,022
to confront my life.

877
01:06:57,331 --> 01:06:59,561
Your grandma taught her that song

878
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,098
for the casting for child singers.

879
01:07:01,302 --> 01:07:05,830
I'm afraid of the nights

880
01:07:06,173 --> 01:07:09,574
that, filled with memories,

881
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:13,076
enchain my dreams.

882
01:07:13,314 --> 01:07:15,748
But the fleeing traveler

883
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,283
sooner or later must come to a halt,

884
01:07:19,487 --> 01:07:22,752
and even though oblivion,
which destroys everything,

885
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:26,324
has killed my old illusions,

886
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:29,519
I still retain a humble hope hidden away

887
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:33,496
and that is all of my heart's fortune.

888
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:39,137
Coming back

889
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:43,639
with a wrinkled forehead

890
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:46,005
and the snows of time

891
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,838
silvering my brow.

892
01:07:48,048 --> 01:07:51,677
Feeling

893
01:07:51,952 --> 01:07:55,217
that life is an instant,

894
01:07:55,423 --> 01:07:57,357
that twenty years is nothing,

895
01:07:57,558 --> 01:07:59,219
that the feverish eyes

896
01:07:59,427 --> 01:08:02,590
wandering in the shadows
seek you and name you.

897
01:08:02,797 --> 01:08:04,958
Living

898
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:07,958
with my soul clinging

899
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:10,535
to a sweet memory

900
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:13,366
that I weep for again.

901
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,507
Autos Amigos.

902
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:55,741
I'm calling because I saw your ad.

903
01:08:56,317 --> 01:08:57,284
I need to rent a van.

904
01:08:57,485 --> 01:08:59,476
What kind, and for how long?

905
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,449
The cheapest one you have.
It's just for one day.

906
01:09:07,962 --> 01:09:08,860
Yes?

907
01:09:09,763 --> 01:09:11,390
Could I speak to Miss Raimunda?

908
01:09:12,132 --> 01:09:13,099
Speaking.

909
01:09:13,501 --> 01:09:16,732
Emilio gave me your number,
so you could show me the restaurant.

910
01:09:16,937 --> 01:09:19,872
I'm very keen to see it.
My name is Carlos.

911
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:22,970
Well,

912
01:09:23,611 --> 01:09:25,408
you should have called earlier

913
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:28,810
because a neighbor has taken it over.

914
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:31,174
Emilio didn't tell me that.

915
01:09:32,286 --> 01:09:34,948
That's his strategy, just in case.

916
01:09:35,356 --> 01:09:37,324
Could I speak to the person
who's taken it over?

917
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:40,687
This is her day off, I'm sorry.

918
01:09:41,262 --> 01:09:44,026
If you call Emilio
I'm sure he'll explain everything.

919
01:09:45,499 --> 01:09:46,693
Thank you.

920
01:09:47,735 --> 01:09:48,861
Goodbye.

921
01:10:01,582 --> 01:10:03,550
Emilio? It's Raimunda.

922
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:06,811
It's great to hear you.
Did a man go to see the restaurant?

923
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:10,513
Yes, but I didn't trust him.
I think he wanted it as a front.

924
01:10:10,724 --> 01:10:12,282
For what?

925
01:10:12,893 --> 01:10:16,056
For drugs, or to open a brothel.
I don't know.

926
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:19,892
When I said it wasn't doing well
he said that was even better, so...

927
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,364
Why on earth did you say that?

928
01:10:24,004 --> 01:10:26,370
I've been meaning to call you for days.

929
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,708
I hope you understand.

930
01:10:29,743 --> 01:10:32,041
I know it's not the way to do things

931
01:10:34,181 --> 01:10:35,842
but I've taken over the restaurant.

932
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,314
You? What do you mean?

933
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:41,716
I can explain it all to you.

934
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:44,783
You were out of line, way out of line.

935
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,051
You abused my trust.

936
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,520
It's no excuse,

937
01:10:50,731 --> 01:10:53,427
but when the film crew appeared,
I was desperate.

938
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:56,468
And now that Paco's left us,
you can imagine...

939
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,331
What? Paco's left you?

940
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:01,267
Yes. We had a huge fight.

941
01:11:01,709 --> 01:11:03,939
He's gone,
and I don't think he'll be back.

942
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:06,404
He left the same day
you went to Barcelona.

943
01:11:07,781 --> 01:11:09,043
How are you coping?

944
01:11:09,617 --> 01:11:11,585
Me? I'm hysterical.

945
01:11:12,152 --> 01:11:14,052
Clutching at straws.

946
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:17,254
Well, we'll try to sort it out.

947
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:21,693
Tell me what I owe for the month
and I'll send it to you,

948
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:23,557
but give me a few days.

949
01:11:44,585 --> 01:11:46,314
- Hello?
- Raimunda?

950
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:48,076
Yes, who's that?

951
01:11:48,288 --> 01:11:51,951
It's Agustina. I'm in Madrid
and I'd like to see you.

952
01:11:53,627 --> 01:11:56,460
It's difficult, I'm really busy today.

953
01:11:56,697 --> 01:11:57,459
Tomorrow?

954
01:11:57,665 --> 01:12:00,429
No, the whole week is a real mess.

955
01:12:00,668 --> 01:12:03,432
Don't say that. I'm in the hospital.

956
01:12:04,004 --> 01:12:05,096
What's wrong?

957
01:12:05,406 --> 01:12:08,569
I've got cancer.
The doctors told me yesterday.

958
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:10,471
I need to see you.

959
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:14,006
Tell me what hospital you're in,
I'll come today.

960
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:15,938
I'm in Central Hospital.

961
01:12:17,317 --> 01:12:19,251
God bless you.

962
01:12:25,893 --> 01:12:28,521
You go up, I'm in a hurry.
Give this to your aunt.

963
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:38,130
- Hello, Auntie.
- What are you doing here?

964
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:43,475
Is that your mother shouting?

965
01:12:44,078 --> 01:12:46,012
Come to the window!

966
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:49,476
What?

967
01:12:49,683 --> 01:12:51,014
I'm leaving Paula with you.

968
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,912
But I'm working.

969
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,647
I have to go to the hospital
to see Agustina. She's got cancer.

970
01:12:56,924 --> 01:12:58,892
What a pity, the poor thing.

971
01:12:59,093 --> 01:13:01,687
Paula is bringing up Auntie's case.
Keep it.

972
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:05,828
I've got to do a few things
and then I'll come back.

973
01:13:06,066 --> 01:13:07,727
Give my regards to Agustina.

974
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:10,830
- Tell her you saw me!
- Yes, nuisance.

975
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:15,669
Can I come in now?

976
01:13:17,778 --> 01:13:18,938
Yes, love.

977
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,026
How are you?

978
01:13:44,938 --> 01:13:46,803
They opened then closed me up again.

979
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:51,606
- I knew I had something nasty.
- Don't give up hope.

980
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:55,177
The flowers are lovely!

981
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:59,144
You shouldn't have bothered.
Leave them there.

982
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:07,589
I have to ask you a favor.

983
01:14:08,262 --> 01:14:09,752
Whatever you want.

984
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:12,395
Close the door.

985
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:17,930
Get a chair.

986
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:31,145
I won't last very long,

987
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:35,479
but I don't want to die without
knowing what happened to my mother.

988
01:14:37,457 --> 01:14:38,856
But what can I do?

989
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,427
You can tell me if she's alive or dead.

990
01:14:44,965 --> 01:14:46,728
How will I know?

991
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,466
Ask your mother.

992
01:14:50,137 --> 01:14:53,004
My mother? She's dead!

993
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,832
But she appeared to your Aunt Paula

994
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:59,875
and looked after her until she died.
The whole village knows that.

995
01:15:01,114 --> 01:15:05,016
If she should appear to you,
ask her about my mother.

996
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:07,111
That's all I'm asking.

997
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,616
What you're asking me is crazy.

998
01:15:10,324 --> 01:15:12,519
Did you ever see her
with your own eyes?

999
01:15:13,327 --> 01:15:14,225
No.

1000
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:16,419
And you live across the street.

1001
01:15:16,864 --> 01:15:18,889
I think she hid from me.

1002
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,292
But I heard your aunt talking to her
a thousand times.

1003
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:28,000
If I hear anything, I'll tell you.

1004
01:15:30,244 --> 01:15:31,905
But I think it's unlikely.

1005
01:15:35,382 --> 01:15:37,213
You owe me this.

1006
01:15:38,485 --> 01:15:39,952
It's all I'm asking.

1007
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,447
I have to go, I've got lots to do.

1008
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:46,423
Wait, my sister wants to see you.
She'll be here any minute.

1009
01:15:46,693 --> 01:15:48,923
Some other day, I'm in a real hurry.

1010
01:15:49,296 --> 01:15:51,127
She wants you to go on TV.

1011
01:15:52,332 --> 01:15:55,358
You know she works on
"Wherever You Are".

1012
01:15:56,003 --> 01:15:58,233
They want to surprise her
and they thought of you.

1013
01:15:58,472 --> 01:16:02,238
You were friends as children
and you both went to an audition.

1014
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:05,137
That's enough for several shows,

1015
01:16:05,345 --> 01:16:07,836
with interviews, music and songs

1016
01:16:08,115 --> 01:16:11,084
from yesterday, from today
and for all times.

1017
01:16:11,385 --> 01:16:13,410
Tell her I don't like television.

1018
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:17,757
Neither do I. I'll tell her,
but don't forget what I said.

1019
01:16:18,392 --> 01:16:19,324
I won't.

1020
01:16:22,195 --> 01:16:24,186
The Russian loves TV.

1021
01:16:26,099 --> 01:16:28,932
I don't know if she understands
but she's hypnotized.

1022
01:16:29,603 --> 01:16:31,571
There's something about trash TV.

1023
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:34,866
Once I start watching it, I can't stop.

1024
01:16:35,409 --> 01:16:38,537
I feel worse and worse but I'm hooked.

1025
01:16:39,046 --> 01:16:40,308
It's like a drug.

1026
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:42,678
I had to stop watching it at night.

1027
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:44,981
I couldn't sleep afterwards.

1028
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:47,551
All that shouting drives you crazy.

1029
01:16:49,856 --> 01:16:51,118
Do you like dolls?

1030
01:16:51,758 --> 01:16:54,556
I like these, they look like
they're from a horror movie.

1031
01:16:54,928 --> 01:16:56,293
They're very ancient.

1032
01:16:57,230 --> 01:17:00,063
Your mom played with them
when she was pregnant with you.

1033
01:17:00,834 --> 01:17:02,529
Why didn't mom live with you?

1034
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,738
We were very short on money.

1035
01:17:06,473 --> 01:17:08,600
Your granddad went to work
in Venezuela,

1036
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,600
I kept Sole

1037
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:13,405
and your mother went to live
with Aunt Paula.

1038
01:17:15,282 --> 01:17:16,579
What has she told you?

1039
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:19,215
Nothing, she doesn't like
talking about that time.

1040
01:17:20,754 --> 01:17:21,812
Do you get along well?

1041
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:23,549
It's better now,

1042
01:17:24,124 --> 01:17:26,115
but at times
she's really stroppy, grandma.

1043
01:17:26,326 --> 01:17:27,793
She's got a temper.

1044
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:29,685
How did you get along with her?

1045
01:17:30,597 --> 01:17:33,327
When she was little
she was the apple of my eye,

1046
01:17:34,368 --> 01:17:36,563
but as a teenager

1047
01:17:37,537 --> 01:17:39,801
for some reason I didn't know

1048
01:17:40,974 --> 01:17:42,635
she grew away from me

1049
01:17:44,211 --> 01:17:46,406
until I lost her completely.

1050
01:17:48,115 --> 01:17:49,707
Your mother didn't love me.

1051
01:17:52,052 --> 01:17:55,647
It really hurts when a daughter
doesn't love her mother.

1052
01:17:57,858 --> 01:17:59,018
That's why,

1053
01:17:59,893 --> 01:18:01,793
now that it's just the two of you,

1054
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:04,059
you have to love her very much

1055
01:18:04,498 --> 01:18:05,897
and she has to feel that.

1056
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:08,691
Why have you come back?

1057
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:13,470
Because I was very lonely.

1058
01:18:17,878 --> 01:18:18,902
Good afternoon.

1059
01:18:20,881 --> 01:18:23,782
I need eight meters of
plastic clothes line

1060
01:18:24,418 --> 01:18:25,510
and some packing tape.

1061
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:26,913
How much tape?

1062
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,417
Four or five rolls.

1063
01:18:28,822 --> 01:18:29,811
Very well.

1064
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:32,049
Five rolls.

1065
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:37,328
One...

1066
01:18:38,598 --> 01:18:39,257
Two...

1067
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:41,525
And a pick and a shovel.

1068
01:18:42,269 --> 01:18:43,031
Very well.

1069
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:25,205
How are you, Raimunda?

1070
01:19:26,246 --> 01:19:27,110
Fed up.

1071
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,472
How's Agustina?

1072
01:19:28,815 --> 01:19:29,907
Mad as a hatter.

1073
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,013
Hi, mom!

1074
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:34,514
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

1075
01:19:35,555 --> 01:19:37,523
Fetch me a glass of water, love.

1076
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:40,592
Do you mind
if she stays here tonight?

1077
01:19:41,228 --> 01:19:43,196
No, but where will she sleep?

1078
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:44,824
In the spare room.

1079
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,701
Paco's coming over tonight.
He wants to talk.

1080
01:19:50,103 --> 01:19:51,468
I'd like us to be alone.

1081
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:53,769
All right.

1082
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:57,103
You're sleeping here tonight.

1083
01:20:02,682 --> 01:20:06,174
I'm off. I've got a long night
ahead of me.

1084
01:20:39,786 --> 01:20:41,481
I need a favor tonight.

1085
01:20:41,688 --> 01:20:43,986
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

1086
01:20:44,191 --> 01:20:46,989
No, but I'll pay you, like any client.

1087
01:20:47,194 --> 01:20:49,355
No, love, for you a discount,

1088
01:20:50,197 --> 01:20:53,189
but I didn't know you liked pussy.

1089
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,230
I don't.

1090
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:58,734
So if you don't want to go
muff-diving, what do you want?

1091
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:00,529
I'll explain on the way.

1092
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,231
First, we have to put
the freezer in the van

1093
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:04,842
and take it to a dung heap.

1094
01:21:05,045 --> 01:21:07,240
We can't carry that on our own!

1095
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,381
We'll ask the neighbors to help us.

1096
01:21:09,783 --> 01:21:11,648
Put on something comfortable.

1097
01:21:12,652 --> 01:21:15,485
You look like
you're going to explode in that.

1098
01:21:17,891 --> 01:21:19,085
It sticks out here.

1099
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,192
Get it on the sidewalk.

1100
01:21:21,661 --> 01:21:24,459
- It's slipping!
- No, it's not.

1101
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,104
Get it parallel to that.

1102
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,604
Now, up! One, two, three!

1103
01:21:39,446 --> 01:21:41,073
Push!

1104
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:46,743
It's in.

1105
01:21:46,953 --> 01:21:51,219
- Bloody hell.
- Did you hurt yourself?

1106
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:54,424
Who needs a spleen, anyway?

1107
01:21:57,364 --> 01:21:58,353
Where are we going?

1108
01:21:59,866 --> 01:22:01,390
To the Jucar River.

1109
01:22:01,768 --> 01:22:02,894
Where's that?

1110
01:22:03,837 --> 01:22:05,395
180 kilometers away.

1111
01:22:05,605 --> 01:22:09,769
What? It'll take us all night
just to go and come back.

1112
01:22:10,043 --> 01:22:11,601
I said I'd pay by the hour.

1113
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:13,172
Just to go with you?

1114
01:22:13,747 --> 01:22:15,180
To come with me to the river,
dig a hole,

1115
01:22:15,382 --> 01:22:18,909
bury the freezer and not ask questions.

1116
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,912
Look, I appreciate your trust

1117
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:24,753
but my life's complicated enough!

1118
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:29,255
I have no job, no papers,
I have to work the streets to survive.

1119
01:22:29,462 --> 01:22:30,827
Christ, you could have asked me!

1120
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,896
I'm asking you now. How much?

1121
01:22:33,099 --> 01:22:34,566
You should've asked first.

1122
01:22:37,937 --> 01:22:39,131
All right,

1123
01:22:40,774 --> 01:22:41,934
give me the nights.

1124
01:22:42,475 --> 01:22:43,567
What nights?

1125
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:46,072
The drinks at night, for a month.

1126
01:22:46,713 --> 01:22:48,681
And I keep what I make
from my cocktails.

1127
01:22:49,182 --> 01:22:50,547
And you buy the bottles.

1128
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,081
All right, partner,

1129
01:22:52,786 --> 01:22:54,276
but not a word about this.

1130
01:22:55,455 --> 01:22:57,821
What can I do? I'm your accomplice now.

1131
01:22:58,992 --> 01:23:00,926
Just so you know,
I haven't killed anyone.

1132
01:23:01,127 --> 01:23:02,651
Don't tell me anything.

1133
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,556
I wasn't going to.

1134
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:45,304
Get out of the way. Give me that.

1135
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:03,646
Oh, my God!

1136
01:24:06,659 --> 01:24:08,820
I can't do any more, I'm dead.

1137
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:11,220
Take a break, I'll fill this in.

1138
01:25:15,395 --> 01:25:16,487
What are you doing here?

1139
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:22,528
- Can we talk?
- I'm really busy.

1140
01:25:23,937 --> 01:25:24,926
Come in.

1141
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:34,102
- How are you?
- The same.

1142
01:25:34,614 --> 01:25:37,082
- Have you found out anything?
- About what?

1143
01:25:37,684 --> 01:25:38,946
About what I asked you.

1144
01:25:40,153 --> 01:25:42,178
I didn't think you were serious.

1145
01:25:43,957 --> 01:25:45,390
May I sit down?

1146
01:25:50,663 --> 01:25:52,153
Have pity on me.

1147
01:25:53,099 --> 01:25:55,124
I do, all the pity you want,

1148
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:56,899
but don't ask crazy things.

1149
01:25:57,103 --> 01:25:59,503
All I want is to know
if she's alive or dead!

1150
01:26:04,777 --> 01:26:07,871
I understand that
with the wind and the cancer

1151
01:26:08,081 --> 01:26:09,514
you've lost your mind,

1152
01:26:09,716 --> 01:26:12,116
but you can't complicate
other people's lives.

1153
01:26:12,352 --> 01:26:14,149
We've got enough on our plates.

1154
01:26:16,356 --> 01:26:18,654
The day your parents died in the fire,

1155
01:26:19,526 --> 01:26:21,460
my mother disappeared.

1156
01:26:26,165 --> 01:26:28,463
Don't you think
that's a strange coincidence?

1157
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:31,593
No, it's just a coincidence.

1158
01:26:32,472 --> 01:26:35,270
You said your mother left
in the morning

1159
01:26:35,909 --> 01:26:38,036
and it wasn't the first time
she disappeared.

1160
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:42,413
Your grandmother had to raise you
because she was never at home!

1161
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:44,139
Don't make me say more.

1162
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:46,347
My mother went off that morning

1163
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,618
but it was to join your father
in the hut.

1164
01:26:50,757 --> 01:26:51,781
That's a lie.

1165
01:26:52,659 --> 01:26:54,627
- No one saw her.
- Of course not.

1166
01:26:55,028 --> 01:26:56,962
She made sure of that.

1167
01:26:58,164 --> 01:27:03,227
My mother was having an affair
with your father.

1168
01:27:05,038 --> 01:27:06,198
What are you saying!

1169
01:27:08,675 --> 01:27:11,872
My mother would never have allowed it!

1170
01:27:12,078 --> 01:27:14,512
That's why she went to live
with your Aunt Paula.

1171
01:27:15,114 --> 01:27:17,742
She did that
because my aunt wasn't well

1172
01:27:17,951 --> 01:27:20,511
but she never left him.
She went between the two houses.

1173
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,551
You don't know, you weren't there

1174
01:27:22,755 --> 01:27:25,519
and you hardly had any contact
with your mother for years.

1175
01:27:25,992 --> 01:27:28,290
I often heard her complain
you treated her like shit.

1176
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:29,825
Those were her words!

1177
01:27:32,265 --> 01:27:34,165
I've heard a lot of things.

1178
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:36,728
Once

1179
01:27:37,136 --> 01:27:39,297
I heard a row
between your mother and mine.

1180
01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:42,505
Your mother told her
she could have your father,

1181
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:43,937
she didn't care.

1182
01:27:44,577 --> 01:27:46,169
And she didn't envy her

1183
01:27:46,779 --> 01:27:49,612
because he'd been born
to hurt the women who loved him.

1184
01:27:52,819 --> 01:27:54,650
What are you getting at?

1185
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:58,050
That your parents' death

1186
01:27:58,691 --> 01:28:01,387
and my mother's disappearance
are connected.

1187
01:28:04,263 --> 01:28:06,561
Then why haven't you gone
to the police?

1188
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,261
They ask a lot of questions

1189
01:28:10,136 --> 01:28:12,866
and we should wash
our dirty linen at home.

1190
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:17,436
That's why I won't go on TV
even though my sister is insisting.

1191
01:28:18,678 --> 01:28:20,942
You and I have to sort this out.

1192
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:26,113
I have to get back to work.

1193
01:28:30,256 --> 01:28:31,746
Think about what I said.

1194
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:34,220
How's Paco?

1195
01:28:35,194 --> 01:28:36,183
What?

1196
01:28:37,196 --> 01:28:38,527
He's fine.

1197
01:28:44,003 --> 01:28:46,403
Shouldn't we call Auntie
to say we're coming?

1198
01:28:46,773 --> 01:28:48,172
She never goes out.

1199
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:49,972
We should warn her.

1200
01:28:50,543 --> 01:28:51,567
Why?

1201
01:28:52,111 --> 01:28:55,103
It's not polite just to turn up
at someone's house,

1202
01:28:55,314 --> 01:28:56,372
even if she is your sister.

1203
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,846
What's up with you and Sole now?

1204
01:28:59,986 --> 01:29:01,613
It's a question of manners.

1205
01:29:02,388 --> 01:29:05,323
You and your aunt
are getting on my fucking nerves!

1206
01:29:05,725 --> 01:29:06,714
You're so vulgar.

1207
01:29:12,699 --> 01:29:14,257
What have you brought, Raimunda?

1208
01:29:15,234 --> 01:29:16,599
Food for the three of us.

1209
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:22,668
Why did you bother?

1210
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:25,002
Why are you shouting?
Are you going deaf?

1211
01:29:25,311 --> 01:29:27,871
- Yes, I'm deaf.
- Deaf as a post.

1212
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:30,379
We're staying a while,
I want you to cut my hair.

1213
01:29:30,883 --> 01:29:33,249
Why didn't you call?
I've got a client.

1214
01:29:35,722 --> 01:29:37,485
Don't worry, I'm in no hurry.

1215
01:29:38,257 --> 01:29:39,485
And we have to talk.

1216
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:42,851
- About what?
- Aunt Paula's house.

1217
01:29:43,229 --> 01:29:46,198
- May I go and watch TV?
- Yes, go on.

1218
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,828
We have to sort out
all the paperwork.

1219
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:53,233
Grandma!

1220
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:54,940
I'm here.

1221
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:57,132
Don't make a sound, my mother's here.

1222
01:29:57,343 --> 01:29:58,571
I heard her.

1223
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:06,449
Where's the Russian?

1224
01:30:06,919 --> 01:30:09,717
- Who's the Russian?
- A woman who's helping me.

1225
01:30:10,189 --> 01:30:12,987
I was telling her about
my son being expelled again.

1226
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:16,056
He slashed the tires of the priest
who teaches him religion.

1227
01:30:16,596 --> 01:30:18,257
I was telling her
and she left me talking to myself

1228
01:30:18,464 --> 01:30:20,364
with my hair half-washed.

1229
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:21,995
She must have gone out.

1230
01:30:22,268 --> 01:30:24,668
I don't know,
but she went off like a shot.

1231
01:30:24,971 --> 01:30:26,336
I'll finish you off.

1232
01:30:26,806 --> 01:30:28,797
She's got claustrophobia

1233
01:30:29,008 --> 01:30:31,408
and at times she needs to go outside.

1234
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:32,805
Some help she is.

1235
01:30:33,079 --> 01:30:34,137
Do you pay her?

1236
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:36,673
No, I took her in.

1237
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:40,285
She eats and sleeps here.
I gave her mom's clothes.

1238
01:30:40,553 --> 01:30:43,147
I don't like you taking in
people you don't know.

1239
01:30:43,389 --> 01:30:46,415
We told her that.
People take advantage of her.

1240
01:30:46,993 --> 01:30:50,224
Look at the Russian.
She's living in luxury here.

1241
01:30:50,429 --> 01:30:52,397
How was Paco the other night?

1242
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,862
Unpleasant. He came to get his clothes.

1243
01:30:56,369 --> 01:30:59,702
I think he's living with someone,
but I couldn't care less.

1244
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:03,105
Why didn't you tell me
you had a Russian?

1245
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:06,173
I guess I forgot.

1246
01:31:15,188 --> 01:31:17,554
That's Agustina!

1247
01:31:20,493 --> 01:31:22,290
Good afternoon, Agustina.

1248
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:23,626
Good afternoon.

1249
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:25,354
We know from your sister

1250
01:31:25,565 --> 01:31:28,432
that your mother was a single parent.

1251
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:32,864
My mother was a hippie.

1252
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,905
That's Agustina!

1253
01:31:36,142 --> 01:31:37,370
She never married.

1254
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:40,075
So she practiced free love.

1255
01:31:40,446 --> 01:31:42,414
Your mother had a friend

1256
01:31:42,615 --> 01:31:45,243
who died the same day she disappeared.

1257
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:49,552
How did she die?

1258
01:31:50,456 --> 01:31:51,753
In a fire.

1259
01:31:52,024 --> 01:31:54,492
There are lots of fires in my village,

1260
01:31:54,727 --> 01:31:56,092
because of the East wind.

1261
01:31:56,395 --> 01:31:59,387
Agustina's village is the wonderful
Alcanfor de las Infantas

1262
01:31:59,632 --> 01:32:01,361
which, according to statistics,

1263
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:06,436
has the highest rate of insanity
per inhabitant.

1264
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,166
Do you think that perhaps
your mother was mentally unbalanced?

1265
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:16,943
When my mother wasn't well,
as she was a hippie,

1266
01:32:17,316 --> 01:32:18,874
she'd leave the village.

1267
01:32:19,085 --> 01:32:22,020
Until one day she left
and never came back.

1268
01:32:22,421 --> 01:32:25,618
Yes, that was almost four years ago.

1269
01:32:26,392 --> 01:32:29,418
We're very interested
in that friend of hers who died

1270
01:32:29,762 --> 01:32:32,925
the same day your mother
disappeared. Tell us about that.

1271
01:32:34,634 --> 01:32:35,658
About what?

1272
01:32:35,935 --> 01:32:40,372
We'd like you to tell us about
the woman who died in the fire.

1273
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,800
- You know there are rumors...
- I don't believe in rumors.

1274
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:47,571
I'd like you to explain
what you told our producer.

1275
01:32:47,947 --> 01:32:50,814
It was something important about
that woman and her husband

1276
01:32:51,017 --> 01:32:53,110
that linked them
to your mother's disappearance.

1277
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:54,650
Is that true?

1278
01:32:56,956 --> 01:32:58,514
I'd rather...

1279
01:33:00,993 --> 01:33:02,255
not talk about that.

1280
01:33:02,628 --> 01:33:04,391
Those were suppositions of mine.

1281
01:33:05,197 --> 01:33:09,725
But you're here to talk about
that woman and your mother.

1282
01:33:10,503 --> 01:33:12,198
I've changed my mind.

1283
01:33:12,405 --> 01:33:14,396
SHE CAN'T BELIEVE HER SISTER

1284
01:33:14,607 --> 01:33:18,065
What's wrong? You look
uncomfortable, a bit nervous.

1285
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:20,641
I'd like to explain

1286
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:22,711
that Agustina is also here to tell us

1287
01:33:22,915 --> 01:33:25,577
that she's got a terminal illness.

1288
01:33:25,885 --> 01:33:26,852
Isn't that so?

1289
01:33:27,954 --> 01:33:29,854
Agustina has got cancer.

1290
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:35,550
You've got cancer.

1291
01:33:35,928 --> 01:33:38,522
But don't be nervous,
you're among friends.

1292
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:40,798
A big hand for Agustina!

1293
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:50,766
Agustina has got a special wish.

1294
01:33:51,477 --> 01:33:53,468
To go to a clinic in Houston.

1295
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,140
But to go to Houston,
you have to speak out.

1296
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:00,144
Remember, you made
a commitment to this channel.

1297
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:30,415
Agustina came to see me.

1298
01:34:30,883 --> 01:34:31,941
She did?

1299
01:34:32,284 --> 01:34:34,343
She insists that mom appears to us.

1300
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,178
She wants me to ask her about her mother.

1301
01:34:37,757 --> 01:34:39,622
She also said that when she disappeared,

1302
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:41,722
her mother was having
an affair with dad.

1303
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:50,662
Do you know anything about that?

1304
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:53,305
No...

1305
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:58,209
Well, mom told me, after...

1306
01:35:00,913 --> 01:35:02,175
After what?

1307
01:35:02,548 --> 01:35:04,914
After... she found out.

1308
01:35:08,687 --> 01:35:09,881
Look at me.

1309
01:35:13,092 --> 01:35:15,754
Are there things I should know and don't?

1310
01:35:16,762 --> 01:35:18,024
Oodles.

1311
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:20,659
But if I tell you

1312
01:35:21,067 --> 01:35:23,126
you'll be annoyed
or you won't believe me.

1313
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:26,770
I promise I'll believe you
and I won't be annoyed.

1314
01:35:28,908 --> 01:35:31,274
Mom's been appearing all the time.

1315
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:34,840
To whom?

1316
01:35:35,114 --> 01:35:36,138
Sit down.

1317
01:35:42,421 --> 01:35:44,514
She was with Aunt Paula until she died.

1318
01:35:45,357 --> 01:35:47,348
It was she who called Agustina

1319
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,120
and opened the door
so she could find the body.

1320
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:54,060
It was she who put out the money
so they'd bring her bread

1321
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,425
and who left everything paid
for the funeral.

1322
01:35:59,238 --> 01:36:01,035
Did Agustina tell you all that?

1323
01:36:03,142 --> 01:36:04,473
You don't believe me.

1324
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:08,679
Agustina is crazy!

1325
01:36:10,049 --> 01:36:11,573
Last time we saw Auntie

1326
01:36:11,784 --> 01:36:14,582
you said yourself it was incredible

1327
01:36:14,787 --> 01:36:18,416
that she could live like that,
with her mind gone and half blind.

1328
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:19,917
Remember?

1329
01:36:20,493 --> 01:36:22,654
Yes, I do, but what are you saying?

1330
01:36:23,596 --> 01:36:25,359
That she wasn't alone.

1331
01:36:26,732 --> 01:36:29,997
Who do you think made the wafers
and put them in tupperwares,

1332
01:36:30,202 --> 01:36:31,897
one for each of us?

1333
01:36:32,838 --> 01:36:35,671
Who do you think took the dolls
and Auntie's valuables

1334
01:36:35,808 --> 01:36:38,072
before the neighbors swiped everything?

1335
01:36:38,677 --> 01:36:40,042
Now do you understand?

1336
01:36:44,783 --> 01:36:45,977
Have you seen her?

1337
01:36:46,685 --> 01:36:47,617
Yes.

1338
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:54,320
Is she, by any chance,

1339
01:36:54,793 --> 01:36:55,817
the Russian?

1340
01:36:57,029 --> 01:36:58,018
Yes.

1341
01:36:59,965 --> 01:37:01,262
Where is she?

1342
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:05,897
In there.

1343
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,092
Mom!

1344
01:37:37,203 --> 01:37:38,636
What are you doing down there?

1345
01:38:01,727 --> 01:38:03,285
Weren't you dead?

1346
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:06,655
I've come back to ask you to forgive me.

1347
01:38:08,634 --> 01:38:10,431
I knew nothing about it.

1348
01:38:12,004 --> 01:38:13,665
I never even imagined it.

1349
01:38:18,377 --> 01:38:19,867
Come on, Paula!

1350
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:39,055
My little girl!

1351
01:38:40,733 --> 01:38:42,200
The worst is over.

1352
01:38:43,168 --> 01:38:44,396
She's seen me

1353
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:46,867
and she didn't reject me, did she?

1354
01:38:47,206 --> 01:38:48,230
No.

1355
01:38:50,276 --> 01:38:52,437
Did you really come back
to ask her to forgive you?

1356
01:38:53,746 --> 01:38:55,714
And also to be with you.

1357
01:38:57,616 --> 01:38:59,709
Some day you can explain it all to me.

1358
01:39:00,286 --> 01:39:04,450
Yes, and that day
I hope you understand me

1359
01:39:05,824 --> 01:39:07,689
and that you forgive me too.

1360
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:36,578
I have to talk to her.

1361
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:39,248
Why don't we go back?

1362
01:39:42,728 --> 01:39:43,820
Now?

1363
01:39:44,363 --> 01:39:45,421
Sure.

1364
01:40:12,758 --> 01:40:15,784
- I've dreamed about this so often.
- So have I.

1365
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:19,895
I don't know where to begin.

1366
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:24,758
You're not a ghost, are you?
You're not dead.

1367
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:26,794
No, love, I'm not.

1368
01:40:27,973 --> 01:40:29,497
That's such a relief.

1369
01:40:30,476 --> 01:40:31,773
But even if I had died,

1370
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:35,205
I'd have come back
to ask you to forgive me

1371
01:40:35,414 --> 01:40:36,904
for not seeing what was going on.

1372
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:39,345
I was blind.

1373
01:40:40,586 --> 01:40:42,554
I found out the day of the fire.

1374
01:40:43,655 --> 01:40:45,247
Had you really left dad?

1375
01:40:46,258 --> 01:40:47,122
Yes.

1376
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,684
I couldn't stand his cheating.

1377
01:40:51,463 --> 01:40:52,896
The afternoon of the fire

1378
01:40:53,565 --> 01:40:56,295
you rang and spoke to Auntie.

1379
01:40:57,269 --> 01:40:59,601
As usual, you didn't ask for me.

1380
01:41:00,172 --> 01:41:03,664
I got angry and told your aunt
you were heartless.

1381
01:41:04,576 --> 01:41:06,476
As I kept badmouthing you,

1382
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:09,011
your aunt

1383
01:41:09,782 --> 01:41:11,409
defended you

1384
01:41:13,152 --> 01:41:14,744
and told me everything.

1385
01:41:20,692 --> 01:41:22,785
That your father had abused you,

1386
01:41:24,563 --> 01:41:26,292
that you'd got pregnant,

1387
01:41:27,466 --> 01:41:28,956
and that Paula

1388
01:41:29,535 --> 01:41:30,866
is your daughter

1389
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:32,869
and your sister.

1390
01:41:34,973 --> 01:41:36,907
I couldn't believe it.

1391
01:41:37,976 --> 01:41:40,376
How could such a monstrous thing
happen in front of me

1392
01:41:40,579 --> 01:41:42,877
without me realizing it?

1393
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:48,418
Then, I understood everything.

1394
01:41:49,655 --> 01:41:51,384
I understood your silence

1395
01:41:52,057 --> 01:41:53,786
and why you grew so distant.

1396
01:41:54,893 --> 01:41:58,590
I understood why your father
went to Venezuela.

1397
01:41:59,264 --> 01:42:01,892
He couldn't cope with the shame
of what he'd done.

1398
01:42:03,769 --> 01:42:05,134
I understood

1399
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:07,864
why, after marrying Paco,

1400
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,964
you went to Madrid

1401
01:42:10,809 --> 01:42:13,277
and wanted nothing to do with us.

1402
01:42:13,645 --> 01:42:16,478
I hated you for not noticing anything.

1403
01:42:17,149 --> 01:42:19,208
And you were right, love.

1404
01:42:20,619 --> 01:42:22,018
When I found out,

1405
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:24,181
I was like a wild thing.

1406
01:42:26,058 --> 01:42:28,788
I went to the hut,
ready to scratch his eyes out!

1407
01:42:29,127 --> 01:42:32,119
I found him asleep
with Agustina's mother,

1408
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:34,194
both of them worn out.

1409
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:36,227
They didn't see me.

1410
01:42:37,002 --> 01:42:38,765
I set fire to the hut.

1411
01:42:39,771 --> 01:42:41,261
It was a windy day

1412
01:42:41,773 --> 01:42:44,970
and in no time the flames
had devoured everything.

1413
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,811
They didn't have time to wake up.

1414
01:42:49,848 --> 01:42:51,941
The ashes in your grave

1415
01:42:52,518 --> 01:42:54,281
are those of Agustina's mother?

1416
01:42:55,587 --> 01:42:56,554
Yes.

1417
01:43:01,059 --> 01:43:02,117
Afterwards,

1418
01:43:03,395 --> 01:43:06,330
I wandered the countryside for a few days,

1419
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:08,661
hiding,

1420
01:43:09,301 --> 01:43:10,700
like an animal.

1421
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:13,734
I was going to give myself up

1422
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:15,701
but first

1423
01:43:16,008 --> 01:43:18,602
I went to Paula's house to see her.

1424
01:43:19,978 --> 01:43:21,741
She was in a terrible state.

1425
01:43:23,015 --> 01:43:24,949
When she saw me

1426
01:43:25,217 --> 01:43:26,878
she wasn't at all surprised.

1427
01:43:28,086 --> 01:43:31,419
I came from the past,
where she was living.

1428
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:36,188
She greeted me
as if I had just gone out the door.

1429
01:43:37,763 --> 01:43:41,062
With the tragedy,
she lost what little reason she had.

1430
01:43:42,067 --> 01:43:43,830
I couldn't leave her on her own,

1431
01:43:44,903 --> 01:43:48,100
so I stayed and looked after her

1432
01:43:49,308 --> 01:43:50,775
until she died.

1433
01:43:55,113 --> 01:43:57,673
In the village they think you're a ghost.

1434
01:43:58,317 --> 01:44:00,911
That's the good thing
about such superstitious places.

1435
01:44:01,386 --> 01:44:04,685
It was easier for me
to go along with them

1436
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:06,289
than to speak the truth.

1437
01:44:07,259 --> 01:44:09,124
I thought I'd be arrested.

1438
01:44:09,795 --> 01:44:12,958
I never imagined
that no one would investigate

1439
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:14,789
or punish me,

1440
01:44:15,634 --> 01:44:18,194
although all this time

1441
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:21,395
I swear I've been in a living purgatory.

1442
01:44:26,878 --> 01:44:28,345
Never better said.

1443
01:44:49,067 --> 01:44:50,762
It's too early to go to the village.

1444
01:44:51,269 --> 01:44:52,668
We shouldn't arrive in daylight.

1445
01:44:52,971 --> 01:44:54,871
Why don't we drive by the river?

1446
01:44:55,641 --> 01:44:57,199
It's been so long since I saw it.

1447
01:44:57,709 --> 01:45:00,200
It's not what it was. It's dry.

1448
01:45:00,512 --> 01:45:01,809
How do you know?

1449
01:45:02,981 --> 01:45:05,916
Because there's a drought
all over Spain.

1450
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:07,380
Don't you know?

1451
01:45:27,205 --> 01:45:30,800
We used to come here for picnics.
Remember, Raimunda?

1452
01:45:31,276 --> 01:45:32,140
Yes.

1453
01:45:33,311 --> 01:45:35,006
There was more water then.

1454
01:45:35,547 --> 01:45:37,071
I told you it was dry.

1455
01:45:37,816 --> 01:45:39,044
Shall we eat something?

1456
01:45:39,951 --> 01:45:40,747
Not for me.

1457
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:44,145
- I'm going to eat a wafer.
- Me too.

1458
01:45:55,033 --> 01:45:57,228
This was your father's favorite place.

1459
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:59,368
Paco's?

1460
01:46:00,372 --> 01:46:01,430
Yes.

1461
01:46:03,408 --> 01:46:05,273
It was the only thing he missed.

1462
01:46:06,044 --> 01:46:07,170
This river.

1463
01:46:27,799 --> 01:46:29,858
I'm glad he's resting here.

1464
01:47:00,298 --> 01:47:01,822
If Paula were alive

1465
01:47:02,634 --> 01:47:03,965
and could see us now,

1466
01:47:04,903 --> 01:47:06,336
all together...

1467
01:47:07,172 --> 01:47:08,605
She'd be so happy.

1468
01:47:15,914 --> 01:47:17,939
Have you always had such a big chest?

1469
01:47:19,151 --> 01:47:21,051
Yes, since I was little.

1470
01:47:21,419 --> 01:47:23,751
I remembered you having less.

1471
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:26,580
Have you had anything done?

1472
01:47:26,925 --> 01:47:29,086
No! What a thing to say!

1473
01:47:29,694 --> 01:47:30,786
All right.

1474
01:47:31,062 --> 01:47:33,030
Grandma, did you ride the bike?

1475
01:47:33,265 --> 01:47:35,290
Yes, half an hour every day.

1476
01:47:35,634 --> 01:47:37,431
It's good for blood pressure
and the heart.

1477
01:47:37,636 --> 01:47:39,501
What did Aunt Paula say?

1478
01:47:40,572 --> 01:47:42,267
She roared laughing.

1479
01:47:45,944 --> 01:47:46,968
'Bye.

1480
01:47:50,348 --> 01:47:51,747
It's Aunt Paula...

1481
01:47:52,017 --> 01:47:53,211
Don't start.

1482
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:55,445
I'll get it.

1483
01:47:56,688 --> 01:47:58,781
Hide mom's plate and cutlery.

1484
01:48:04,963 --> 01:48:07,193
- Who is it?
- Agustina.

1485
01:48:11,269 --> 01:48:13,032
We're having supper.

1486
01:48:13,505 --> 01:48:15,200
I'm sorry to bother you.

1487
01:48:16,308 --> 01:48:17,639
Don't stay out there.

1488
01:48:18,476 --> 01:48:19,465
Thank you.

1489
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:27,410
Good evening.

1490
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:29,777
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1491
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:39,928
I came to apologize about the show.

1492
01:48:40,699 --> 01:48:43,497
You shouldn't have done it.
It wasn't right.

1493
01:48:43,902 --> 01:48:45,062
I know that.

1494
01:48:45,303 --> 01:48:46,861
It's no excuse,

1495
01:48:47,339 --> 01:48:49,068
but they offered
to take me to Houston.

1496
01:48:49,307 --> 01:48:50,899
They cure everything there.

1497
01:48:51,743 --> 01:48:53,176
But I couldn't do it.

1498
01:48:53,812 --> 01:48:56,747
I'd rather die alone in my house,
but at peace,

1499
01:48:57,349 --> 01:48:59,044
and able to look you in the eye.

1500
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:05,156
- Mom, I'm going to bed, all right?
- Yes, go on.

1501
01:49:07,325 --> 01:49:09,691
- Will you have some supper?
- No, thanks.

1502
01:49:10,061 --> 01:49:13,224
I heard you're going to sell the house.

1503
01:49:13,431 --> 01:49:16,229
We'd thought about it
but now we're here...

1504
01:49:17,035 --> 01:49:19,026
There are so many memories.

1505
01:49:20,572 --> 01:49:22,597
Well, I have to go.

1506
01:49:23,308 --> 01:49:25,435
Why don't you stay a while?

1507
01:49:25,944 --> 01:49:29,004
I have to go to the nurse
to get my injection.

1508
01:49:29,614 --> 01:49:32,344
In Madrid they told me
to learn to do it myself

1509
01:49:33,084 --> 01:49:34,381
but it gives me the creeps!

1510
01:49:35,253 --> 01:49:38,950
Your sister is unforgivable.
Leaving you alone like this.

1511
01:49:39,157 --> 01:49:40,454
Don't even mention her.

1512
01:49:41,593 --> 01:49:44,118
As I didn't say what they wanted
on television

1513
01:49:44,462 --> 01:49:45,861
she's not speaking to me.

1514
01:49:46,331 --> 01:49:49,732
She's very angry with me.
But I'm even angrier with her.

1515
01:49:50,402 --> 01:49:51,733
With good reason.

1516
01:49:52,037 --> 01:49:53,470
I envy you two.

1517
01:49:54,906 --> 01:49:56,339
You're so close.

1518
01:50:17,162 --> 01:50:18,390
Irene!

1519
01:50:20,398 --> 01:50:22,229
I've longed to see you.

1520
01:50:22,467 --> 01:50:23,593
Here I am.

1521
01:50:24,669 --> 01:50:26,227
I heard about your problem

1522
01:50:26,905 --> 01:50:29,373
and I can imagine how lonely you are.

1523
01:50:29,774 --> 01:50:30,866
Very lonely.

1524
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:37,014
If only Paula were here...

1525
01:50:37,382 --> 01:50:39,543
I'm here to look after you.

1526
01:50:40,418 --> 01:50:41,908
You left the door open.

1527
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,613
Don't worry, I closed it.

1528
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:46,550
Did you go to the nurse?

1529
01:50:46,758 --> 01:50:49,056
No, I'm very tired. Tomorrow.

1530
01:50:49,794 --> 01:50:52,194
Tomorrow you'll be in a lot of pain.

1531
01:50:52,664 --> 01:50:55,132
Have you got the medicine
and the needles?

1532
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:57,096
Yes, I bought it all in Madrid.

1533
01:50:57,302 --> 01:50:59,497
Good, I'll give you the injection.

1534
01:51:05,677 --> 01:51:07,406
I was born in this bed.

1535
01:51:09,147 --> 01:51:11,138
My mother slept here.

1536
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:15,352
And in this bed
we held your sister Paula's wake.

1537
01:51:16,087 --> 01:51:17,349
I know,

1538
01:51:18,356 --> 01:51:19,983
and I'm so grateful.

1539
01:51:24,662 --> 01:51:26,960
We have to talk, Irene.

1540
01:51:27,732 --> 01:51:29,427
About everything you want.

1541
01:51:30,235 --> 01:51:32,328
But don't tell anyone I've come back.

1542
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,800
Don't worry.

1543
01:51:36,908 --> 01:51:39,433
Thank you for not talking
about me on television.

1544
01:51:41,146 --> 01:51:43,273
It's our own business.

1545
01:51:44,349 --> 01:51:45,646
That's right,

1546
01:51:45,984 --> 01:51:47,815
and no one else's.

1547
01:52:56,054 --> 01:52:58,648
Mom, it's me, let me in!

1548
01:53:00,692 --> 01:53:02,523
What are you doing here? Come in!

1549
01:53:04,729 --> 01:53:06,128
I missed you.

1550
01:53:06,431 --> 01:53:09,958
- Are you going to stay here?
- Yes, until the end.

1551
01:53:10,468 --> 01:53:11,992
Agustina is very ill.

1552
01:53:12,637 --> 01:53:13,968
After what I did to her mother,

1553
01:53:14,172 --> 01:53:16,868
the least I can do
is look after her until she dies.

1554
01:53:18,476 --> 01:53:20,569
I have so much to tell you.

1555
01:53:20,778 --> 01:53:23,178
I haven't told you about Paco
or what I've done.

1556
01:53:23,381 --> 01:53:26,578
I'm dying to hear everything,
but go away now.

1557
01:53:27,051 --> 01:53:30,282
I'll see you every day.
Between us we'll manage.

1558
01:53:30,488 --> 01:53:31,580
Yes.

1559
01:53:34,492 --> 01:53:36,187
I need you, mom.

1560
01:53:38,997 --> 01:53:41,465
I don't know how I lived
all these years without you.

1561
01:53:42,567 --> 01:53:43,898
Don't say that.

1562
01:53:44,836 --> 01:53:46,133
I'll start to cry

1563
01:53:47,105 --> 01:53:49,437
and ghosts don't cry.

1564
02:00:55,700 --> 02:01:00,262
