1
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:22,118
 

2
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:25,484
 

3
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:28,684
 

4
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:31,042
 

5
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:34,119
 

6
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:37,723
 

7
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,845
 

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,556
 

9
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:47,799
 

10
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,721
 

11
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,120
 

12
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:00,802
 

13
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:03,083
 

14
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,761
Put some stones in the vase,
or it'll fall over.

15
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,236
 

16
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:13,761
This bloody wind!

17
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:15,804
Polish the letters well, they have to shine!

18
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,526
There are so many widows in this village!

19
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:22,077
The women here live longer than the men.
Except our poor mother.

20
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:23,726
She was lucky.

21
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:25,206
Raimunda! Don't say that!

22
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:28,525
She died in Dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

23
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:33,158
Burned to death!
I can't imagine a worse way to die.

24
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:35,556
They were asleep

25
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,201
They didn't even realize.

26
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:40,245
Even so, how can you say
something like that!

27
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:41,965
Hello, Agustina.

28
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,046
Good morning, Agustina.

29
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,040
Good morning, Manola.
- Good morning.

30
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:50,079
Is that everything, Mom?

31
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:50,997
I'll get the rest.

32
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:52,805
What a pleasant surprise!

33
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,036
Good Lord!

34
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,436
- Could this be Paula?

35
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:56,437
- Of course.

36
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,245
She's all grown up!

37
00:01:58,407 --> 00:01:59,237
Give her a kiss

38
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:03,361
She's got your father's eyes

39
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:04,357
How are you?

40
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:05,482
Not good

41
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:06,602
Don't say that...

42
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,523
I just came to check on my grave

43
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:12,678
with this wind, 
you can't keep it clean.

44
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,121
It looks lovely.

45
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:15,561
Cleaning it relaxes me.

46
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:19,242
I often come here on my own,
I sit down and the hours pass by...

47
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,762
We'd better leave,
we're going to visit Aunt Paula

48
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,406
Come and see me afterwards.

49
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,556
Sure.

50
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,006
And... how's Paco doing?

51
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,960
Fine, he stayed in Madrid, working

52
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:36,086
Mom, does Agustina really come
and clean her own grave?

53
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:37,760
Yes, it's custom here

54
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:40,805
They buy a plot
and look after it all their lives,

55
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,400
like a second home.

56
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,497
That's creepy!

57
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:44,886
It's tradition here.

58
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,041
Shall I drive?

59
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,083
Yes.

60
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:12,596
Aunt Paula!

61
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,682
Who is it?

62
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:15,836
Raimunda.

63
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:16,917
Don't take all day.

64
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,566
...And you, don't start rushing me

65
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,683
I don't like going back
after dark.

66
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:22,758
Be nice to Auntie,
don't laugh at her.

67
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:23,518
All right.

68
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,439
This house still smells like Mom.

69
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:26,756
How are you, Auntie?

70
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:31,605
Look at how thin you are!
Have you had the baby?

71
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:32,882
Fourteen years ago.

72
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,446
Doesn't time fly!

73
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:35,835
Who are these people?

74
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,396
Who do you think?
Sole and my Paula!

75
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,795
The same name as me!

76
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,286
...and Sole

77
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,279
Shall we go into the dining room?

78
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,557
That Sole looks
like quite a sourpuss.

79
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,246
Auntie, please!

80
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,360
<i>... the wind carried
the cinders to the bushes. </i>

81
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:03,486
<i>The result is the most tragic fire
in the last 13 years. </i>

82
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,039
Do you mind if I turn it off?

83
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm not even watching it...

84
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:12,436
Fires are a terrible thing.
That's the way your parents died, my dear

85
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:13,881
Why did I come in here?

86
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,162
I don't know, Auntie.

87
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:16,963
...to talk maybe?

88
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,082
No

89
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,362
Maybe for something to eat?

90
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,757
Yes! Look in the cupboard.

91
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,478
My joints are killing me...

92
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,885
Look, these pastries...

93
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,243
Just like mom's... have one

94
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,961
Well... How did it go in the cemetery?

95
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,716
Your mother is delighted.

96
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,798
Did you scrub
the headstone properly?

97
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:40,161
Of course, Auntie.

98
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,318
She likes it very clean.

99
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,557
If she could, she would do it herself...

100
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,445
but of course, the poor thing can't.

101
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:49,846
Of course, she can't.

102
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,323
Auntie, don't you ever get lonely
in such a big house?

103
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,476
No.

104
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,799
You'd be better off in a home,
where you'd be looked after.

105
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm fine as I am, thank you.

106
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,477
I'm going to the bathroom.

107
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,602
Permission granted.

108
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,044
You can't live on your own.
I'm worried about you.

109
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,840
How do you manage your meals?

110
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:10,877
Very well...

111
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:14,198
Agustina brings me bread,
your mother does the cooking,

112
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,279
...and if I need anything from the store,
I just call them and they bring it over.

113
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:18,402
I'm fine.

114
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,366
What a lovely gesture, Auntie!

115
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,082
Look!

116
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,365
It's got your name on it.

117
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:13,437
Shall we go?

118
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,482
Yes.

119
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,966
Aunt Paula, we're leaving now.

120
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,845
God, my joints are bad...!

121
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,557
Don't get up.

122
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:23,285
How am I not going to get up?

123
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:29,119
Next time I come back,
I'm taking you home with me.

124
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,959
Yes, that's fine, next time.

125
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,442
The important thing is that you
come back, Raimunda

126
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,798
You've gotten very wobbly.

127
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:58,436
Take care of yourself.

128
00:06:58,607 --> 00:06:59,323
I will

129
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,045
And you be careful!

130
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:07,557
We'll do that.
I love you so much!

131
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:08,557


132
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:10,476
Are we stopping by Agustina's place?

133
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:11,557
Yes.

134
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,880
Come on in!

135
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:27,239
So, how did you find your auntie?

136
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,123
Bad.

137
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,242
Terrible.

138
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,875
She's very clumsy.
I don't know how she manages

139
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:34,277
She does very well
without going outside.

140
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:38,076
Every day she has her chunk of bread,
when I arrive she has the money ready

141
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:39,157
Let's go out to the patio.

142
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,927
She's in an awful state, 

143
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,839
She doesn't know what year it is.

144
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,521
She talks about Mom
as if she were still alive.

145
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,403
Yes.

146
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,684
It's because for her, she's not dead
and she can't get used to it

147
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,759
Have a seat for a while, please...

148
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:56,363
I was thinking about paying you something
to look in on her every day.

149
00:07:56,527 --> 00:08:00,122
No need to give me anything.
It's my pleasure.

150
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:01,956
I'd take her with me...

151
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,641
but I'd have to throw
my husband out to make room.

152
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,081
but we have to do something

153
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:09,319
Every morning, before I go shopping,
I tap on her window

154
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:12,399
and I don't leave 
until she answers me.

155
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,246
I keep an eye on her.

156
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,358
You can't imagine how
grateful I am, Agustina

157
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,526
I just think that hopefully...

158
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,077
someone is doing the same
for my own mother...

159
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:25,686
...wherever she is.

160
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,567
See how modern she was?

161
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,638
The only hippie in the village.

162
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,484
Look at her plastic jewelry

163
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,277
They're cool!

164
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,244
Top quality plastic

165
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,837
Every time I smoke a joint
I think of her

166
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,760
Oh please! Look at the example
you're setting for Paula!

167
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:56,360
Still no news?

168
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:59,963
Nothing. It's like she's disappeared
from the face of the earth

169
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,920
How's your sister Brigida?

170
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,477
Her? Still in Madrid,
she's a big hit on trash TV.

171
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,965
Mom, I ran out of credit...

172
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:13,120
Good, we'll get a break
from your phone.

173
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,356
Use mine if you like...

174
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:15,477
Don't! She'll bankrupt you.

175
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:16,516
forget it then...

176
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,078
As I was saying,
Brigida is on so many shows

177
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,363
That she's going to put a deposit
on an apartment in Madrid.

178
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:23,880
And she's going to record an album

179
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,402
Your sister always liked singing...

180
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,240
You did too! Do you remember
when the two of you...

181
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,159
you were 13 or so, weren't you?

182
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,716
You went to an audition
for young talent.

183
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:36,196
Really?
You never told me about that!

184
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:39,560
It was your granny's idea.
She was up for anything.

185
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:42,446
Talking about mothers, 
maybe yours hasn't shown up

186
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,802
so as not to ruin
your sister's career.

187
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:48,243
I don't think so...
Mom would love to be on TV...

188
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,966
She'd have the time of her life.

189
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:51,876
Would you like some?

190
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,480
No, no, no, no...

191
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:56,320
I grow it myself.
Check out my plants!

192
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:57,681
No, no, no...

193
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,285
Girl, we should get going.

194
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:03,962
Right. Listen... did you report her
disappearance to the police?

195
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:06,197
We didn't,
Brigida thinks it's not necessary...

196
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,676
since she's mentioned it so often on TV...

197
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:12,556
Yes, but you have to report it
to the police, not say it on TV.

198
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,515
Look, I don't know...

199
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:19,445
Anyway, It's not the first time
your mother left home

200
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,563
Yes, but never for this long.

201
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,763
It's been three and a half years already

202
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't give up hope.

203
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:29,759
and take care of yourself, you don't look well...
Your oleander is gorgeous.

204
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:34,079
Yes, this year it managed to escape from the aphids.
But I've really lost my appetite

205
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,475
Maybe it's because of the pot...

206
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,798
No way, if it weren't for the pot, 
I would never eat

207
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,439
You have your grandpa's eyes.

208
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:49,964
Pot gives me an appetite,
and mellows me out

209
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,922
Right then, have a nice trip home!

210
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:12,285
You won't believe what I saw
upstairs outside the bathroom...

211
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:13,796
What?

212
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,519
An exercise bike.

213
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:17,642
That's nuts

214
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,960
Why would Auntie want an exercise bike,
when she can barely walk?

215
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,243
Exactly, she's lost her mind.

216
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,837
Don't talk like that about her, Sole.

217
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:28,477
Mom, she didn't even recognize us.

218
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:34,004
It's the hot, dry wind there
that makes so many people crazy.

219
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,438
The donuts are very tasty, don't you think?

220
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:41,241
How does she manage to make pastries
when she can barely see?

221
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:08,436
Hello, Regina.
You off to work?

222
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:09,835
I have no choice, my dear

223
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,839
Hey listen, why don't you give her a lift?

224
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:12,723
Where to?

225
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:16,277
To casa de campo, but if you could drop
me downtown that would be great

226
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,878
OK.
- Thanks.

227
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,242
Later.

228
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,198
Hi, dad.
- Hi.

229
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,163
What's up?

230
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,483
How was it?
Did you enjoy yourselves?

231
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,240
At the cemetery? Are you kidding me?

232
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,682
No, no.

233
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:56,998
So, taking care of yourself?

234
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,486
Me? What are you talking about?

235
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,925
Paula, sit properly!
Close those legs, dammit!

236
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,920
Will you bring me another beer?

237
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,359
You must be joking...

238
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:11,520
Get me another beer, please.

239
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,523
Paco, you've had enough already.
You have to go to work tomorrow.

240
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:22,036
I'm off tomorrow, and the day after.
- How's that?

241
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:24,876
They fired me.

242
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:26,886
Hang on a second...

243
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,280
Goddamn it!

244
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:34,038
I'll have to look for a job on Sundays,
my only day off

245
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:38,043
I'll look for a job, but let me
watch the game in peace and quiet.

246
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,397
You can kiss goodbye
soccer and cable TV, too

247
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,445
Aren't we a poor family?
So we'll live like one!

248
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,883
Paula, get off the phone right now!

249
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,962
Here's supper if you want it

250
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:25,636
Are you mad?
- No.

251
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,323
I'm worried about my aunt.

252
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,477
She's worse than ever.

253
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:34,396
She didn't recognize Paula or Sole.

254
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:39,522
How can anyone live like that?
- Well she can.

255
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:43,766
Paco, leave me alone.

256
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,126
What's with you?

257
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,596
I'm wiped out,
and I have to be up early tomorrow.

258
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,719
OK, I'll do all the work...

259
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,999
Paco please, don't be a pest

260
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,878
Don't you call me a pest again

261
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,356
I'm sorry

262
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:32,640
What are you doing here?

263
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,115
Waiting for you

264
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,276
How come?

265
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,565
I called to remind you
to get bread, we're out

266
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,124
I didn't occur to you to buy some? 
- No

267
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,604
You're soaking wet.
How long have you been out?

268
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,440
I don't know. A while.

269
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:54,916
Where have you been?
With your girlfriends?

270
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:56,682
No.

271
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:59,279
I wasn't anywhere.

272
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,681
Then why didn't you answer your phone?

273
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,162
What's the matter with you? Huh?

274
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,360
Is something wrong?

275
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,083
What is it, tell me!

276
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,641
And your father?

277
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:28,435
He is...

278
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:30,686
Where?

279
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,362
He's in the kitchen.

280
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:37,482
 

281
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:45,686
What happened?

282
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,000
I was in the kitchen...
standing at the counter...

283
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,321
suddenly he started pressing 
himself against me...

284
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:56,726
He was drunk.

285
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,683
I shouted at him what was he doing,
He said he wasn't really my father.

286
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,041
I turned around and 
shoved him off of me...

287
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,607
but he just grabbed me again, harder

288
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,205
I pushed him off

289
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:23,875
He unzipped his pants. He kept
saying that it wasn't wrong

290
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,686
because he's not my father.

291
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,685
I opened a drawer, took out a knife...

292
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:34,886
and threatened him

293
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:37,722
just to scare him off

294
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,240
It didn't faze him

295
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:46,999
He said I wasn't brave enough...
pulled me to the floor...

296
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,526
...and jumped on top of me

297
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,325
What are you going to do, Mom?

298
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,681
I don't know.

299
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:10,405
Go and get changed, you'll catch pneumonia

300
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,277
Paula!

301
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:19,155
Remember this: I killed him
and you didn't see anything

302
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,204
because you were out.

303
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,237
It's important that you remember that.

304
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:08,476
Don't answer

305
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,922
Who can that be?

306
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,800
- I don't know, go to your room

307
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,518
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

308
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:20,926
I'm coming, Emilio

309
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:28,757
What's up?

310
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:32,317
Sorry to bother you so late,
but I'm going to Barcelona tomorrow.

311
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,718
I wanted to leave you the keys to the
restaurant, in case someone wants to see it.

312
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:39,765
I wouldn't mind showing it,
but I'm hardly ever here.

313
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:41,883
How about Paco? 
He's usually here all day, isn't he?

314
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,601
Well Paco...

315
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:48,243
...finally found a job.
He's starting tomorrow.

316
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,722
Are you hurt?

317
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,158
No. 
Just my monthlies.

318
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,159
Actually, the thing is...

319
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:58,239
now that Paco is busy,
I'll have more free time...

320
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,438
Give me the keys, I'll manage

321
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:04,724
Here's my phone numbers.
My brother's, where I'll be staying...

322
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:06,366
the other is my cell phone.

323
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:08,996
So you're leaving tomorrow?

324
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,236
In the morning...

325
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:15,236
Just out of curiosity, how much are you
asking? I've always liked your restaurant...

326
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:17,602
It's a pity you don't like the owner as well...

327
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:19,479
Emilio, for God's sake...

328
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:22,719
For the business sale I'm asking 30,000,
but it's negotiable

329
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,565
OK, we'll miss you.

330
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,604
And I'll miss you girls.

331
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:33,803
Good luck.
- Thanks.

332
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:40,236
Is Emilio leaving?
- Yes.

333
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,759
Go back to your room, Paula.

334
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:44,485
No, I want to stay with you.

335
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,723
Listen, I'll need your help later.

336
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,355
Don't answer it!

337
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,083
It'll be one of your girlfriends.

338
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,717
Get it and say
you can't talk now...

339
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,479
... it's too late

340
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:12,756
I can't talk right now.

341
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,282
- What are you saying?
It's your Aunt Sole...

342
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,002
Put your mom on the phone.

343
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,840
Mom, it's Aunt Sole

344
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:20,686
Tell her I'm busy.

345
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,285
Auntie, she's busy right now.

346
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:25,199
Get her on the phone, it's important

347
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,605
Mom, you have to take this.

348
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:33,602
Sole, I have loads of clothes to iron

349
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,803
and I've been working
all evening at the airport

350
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,286
Agustina called.

351
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:39,756
Aunt Paula died.

352
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:41,682
When?

353
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:42,996
A little while ago

354
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,484
Aunt Paula died.

355
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:55,236
I was just thinking
about moving her in here.

356
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,159
The poor thing must have died all alone.

357
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,675
Don't cry, dear

358
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,679
Look, Agustina said not to worry.

359
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,725
She and Squinty will lay her out
before we get there.

360
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:09,163
Auntie had everything prearranged!

361
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:12,239
She'd already chosen her coffin,
and paid for everything!

362
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:15,922
It's amazing that
she was so lucid at the end.

363
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,205
I can't make it to her funeral.

364
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:22,162
As much as it hurts me but I'm too busy.

365
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,966
How can you not come, Raimunda? 
You can't come with me?

366
00:24:25,127 --> 00:24:27,118
I just can't, no way...

367
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,642
You'll have to go alone.
- Alone?

368
00:24:32,647 --> 00:24:35,719
No way! You know how scared
I am of dead people.

369
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,725
But you don't have to see Auntie

370
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:39,923
I'll ask Agustina to take care of that

371
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,315
And if they ask me about you?

372
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:45,277
Tell them then that I just had a
gall bladder operation... whatever

373
00:24:45,447 --> 00:24:48,325
Look, I'll go as soon as I can,
but right now it's completely impossible

374
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:52,046
I don't understand you, Raimunda.
Aunt Paula loved you so much!

375
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:53,756
and I loved her, too.

376
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:58,762
Look, Sole, I'll explain it to you someday,
and when I do, you'll flip out.

377
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm flipping out already.

378
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:03,883
All right, take a tranquilizer,
I'll take one too...

379
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:06,125
And in the morning, you go

380
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,322
Okay?
- Okay.

381
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,435
The door.

382
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:51,757
Wait.

383
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,680
You stay here.
Stay here and stand guard.

384
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,518
I hope it hasn't changed
since I worked here.

385
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:46,476
Don't come in here!

386
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,003
Sorry.

387
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,242
What do you want?

388
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,278
I wanted to see
if the restaurant was open.

389
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:57,200
We're closed. Why?

390
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,356
Give me a hand...

391
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,567
We're shooting a movie in the area

392
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:07,407
and I'm looking for a place
to cater for the crew

393
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:10,599
Do you know of a restaurant nearby?

394
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:13,676
How many of you are there?

395
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,880
25 plus 5... 30 people.

396
00:29:18,607 --> 00:29:20,040
Help me out here.

397
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:25,605
I can do it myself, if you want.
We were supposed to be closed today.

398
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,925
So dinner for 30...

399
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:31,206
When?

400
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,805
We stop at 3:30, and we're close by...

401
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,122
Say around 4:00?
- Fine.

402
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:38,402
Good

403
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,323
Right and... how much would you pay?

404
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,726
10 euro each

405
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:45,481
That's fine.

406
00:29:47,247 --> 00:29:51,081
Sorry for shouting at you before,
you scared me

407
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:55,565
I'll see you at 4:00 then, thanks very much

408
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,523
OK, thanks

409
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:57,642
See you later

410
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:00,676
Damn! It's 10:00 already.

411
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,683
Two kilos

412
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,200
Can I have two more?

413
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,159
How much are the potatoes?

414
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,363
1.60 for 4 kilos

415
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,522
I'll take 8 kilos
- Okay.

416
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,361
How are you Regina?

417
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,757
- Hello, Raimunda. That's quite a load of groceries!

418
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:29,636
I'm cooking dinner for 30 people
Can you lend me 100 euro?

419
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:33,641
I'm broke, I just bought a
huge pork roast...

420
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,923
That'd be perfect! I'll buy it off you!

421
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:38,157
It cost me 10.80,
and it's the only thing I got

422
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:40,238
I'll pay you for it tomorrow.
Please! do this favor for me!

423
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,284
All right. I'll bring it over

424
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:43,004
Thank you, sweetie!

425
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,441
Today I go on a diet.

426
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,245
Why not, it'll be good for you

427
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:51,923
Hi, Ines.
So you're back from the village?

428
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes, I got back last night.
How are you?

429
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,238
Did you happen to bring
any sausage or chorizo?

430
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:00,523
I certainly did!
The sausages are fantastic.

431
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,645
My mother-in-law orders them
specially for me.

432
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:05,126
I need one and a half kilos.

433
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:05,878
How's that?

434
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,557
I'm cooking dinner for 30.
- Who's coming?

435
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:12,766
Is a long story, I'll tell you some other time.
Can you sell it to me? I'll pay you tomorrow

436
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:14,804
Of course. Don't you worry, I'll bring it over.

437
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,925
Thanks! and... wait,
did you get any sweets?

438
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:21,205
I got some cookies that will melt in your mouth...

439
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,835
With your high cholesterol and glucose

440
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,998
cookies are the last thing you need!

441
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,397
It's my only vice.
I've got three boxes of them.

442
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,200
You shouldn't be eating them.

443
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,164
I shouldn't? And what should I do,
give them away?

444
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:33,316
Sell them to me

445
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,319
OK, but let me at least try them

446
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,557
Of course, have two, three, four...

447
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:41,322
But don't be a glutton.

448
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:42,724
- Bring them round to me, love.
- I'll do that.

449
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,836
See you later.
- Bye, doll

450
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,324
Anybody for roast pork? It's delicious...

451
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:03,675
You too?

452
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,397
Pork roast? It's yummy.

453
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:53,000
Agustina?

454
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,564
Is that you, Agustina?

455
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,960
 

456
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:09,195
Soledad, my dear child

457
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,524
Sole, I have to talk to you.

458
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,956
Sole!

459
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:44,835
All right.

460
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:47,680
It's okay, calm down, Sole.

461
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,566
Agustina...

462
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:54,278
Where is she?
- Upstairs, in my mother's room.

463
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:56,559
The best room in the house

464
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,887
I brought her here,
so we can give her a better wake.

465
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,446
Thank you very much, Agustina.

466
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:06,365
Come on,
we're the principal mourners.

467
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:14,317
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

468
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:18,436
I spoke with your sister, poor thing,
just out of surgery!

469
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:20,605
Yes, unfortunate timing, huh?

470
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,076
She told me not to let you see the body.

471
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:25,317
Don't worry, you won't have to see her...

472
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:30,683
I'm sorry my dear

473
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:34,802
My condolences.
And you remember Squinty, don't you?

474
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:44,423

 
475
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:46,165
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

476
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:52,561
Let her catch her breath,
she's exhausted.

477
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:54,800
Come here, Sole,

478
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,241
don't fret, sit here beside me

479
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,120
It was already dark

480
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:08,365
I had finished supper and was
watching TV

481
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:12,160
when I heard someone knocking at the door.

482
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,765
I wasn't sure if I had heard right,

483
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,558
but then I heard it again.

484
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,321
"Who is it?" I asked.

485
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,079
And then I heard a voice say:

486
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:27,606
"Agustina"

487
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:30,886
I wasn't afraid

488
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:34,121
I looked outside,
but I didn't see anyone

489
00:35:35,207 --> 00:35:37,004
I looked over at your aunt's house.

490
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,044
and I noticed the front door was standing open.

491
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:41,365
I thought that was odd,

492
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:43,526
so I went over...

493
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,126
I called out for your aunt,

494
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,719
but she didn't answer.

495
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:51,763
And how could she, poor thing?

496
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,640
I went into the bedroom

497
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:57,363
and there she was, in bed

498
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:00,517
utterly still and quiet.

499
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:03,083
Her spirit called you.

500
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:06,241
But was it Paula's spirit
or the other one's?

501
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,681
One of them.

502
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:10,396
I can't say who it was
because I didn't see

503
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,317
But, as true as I'm talking to you now

504
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:17,442
someone or something
warned me that Paula had died

505
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:20,563
and opened the front door to let me in.

506
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:23,318
Come into the kitchen.

507
00:36:32,007 --> 00:36:34,877
I bet you haven't eaten yet.
- No, I haven't

508
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:38,566
Not since last night,
but I'm all right.

509
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,479
I thought as much.

510
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:42,885
This'll do you good.

511
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:45,800
Don't give me any more, that's plenty.

512
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,882
What did the women mean, Agustina?

513
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:59,883
Nothing, just talk.
You know what villages are like.

514
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:02,044
They were talking about my mother.

515
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:04,323
Some people say they've seen her.

516
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:09,317
They say she came back
to take care of your Aunt Paula.

517
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,446
Has she ever appeared to you?

518
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,206
- No. What about you?
- No, me neither.

519
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,837
But those things happen.

520
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:19,282
I know.

521
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:23,363
My grandfather, rest in peace,
appeared to my grandmother

522
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,878
At first she was scared

523
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:27,722
Go on, eat!

524
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:31,276
But then, she asked him what he wanted

525
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,558
and my grandpa's ghost told her

526
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:36,002
that he had left an unkept promise

527
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,359
My grandmother carried out the promise

528
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,836
and the whole village
went with her to the cemetery

529
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,965
where they left my grandfather
so he would rest in peace...

530
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:45,685
...and he never appeared again.

531
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,602
 

532
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:52,719
This isn't just some story I heard

533
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:54,715
It's what really happened

534
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:56,795
I see...

535
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:29,365
Do you want to come have a look
around your auntie's house?

536
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:31,404
in case you want to take anything?

537
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,080
No, I'll leave that to Raimunda

538
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:36,523
Tell her everything went very well,
and that the whole village came.

539
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:39,041
I'll tell her

540
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:42,483
I'm going to miss her so much!

541
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:48,042
Go on...

542
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:50,526
Sole!  

543
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,718
Open up!
It's your mother.

544
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,879
I'm not going to harm you

545
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:09,239
My mother is dead.

546
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:15,046
You must be her ghost or her spirit

547
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,357
OK, have it your way,
but let me out of here!

548
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:19,085
I'm in the trunk!

549
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:24,280
Right, it's unbelievable the
things you come up with, Mom...

550
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,086
Soledad...

551
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:36,846
my dear daughter...

552
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,518
Don't be afraid of me

553
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:41,156
I am your mother.

554
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,321
Aren't you going to hug me, my love?

555
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:59,160
OK... give me a hand

556
00:40:59,327 --> 00:41:00,521
here...

557
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,603
Aunt Paula's suitcase!
- Yes.

558
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:15,161
What's in it?
- Clothes, and some of her valuables.

559
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:17,921
I took them before the neighbors got there.

560
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,920
Except for Agustina, they were all
picking through her drawers and cabinets

561
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:22,884
But I had already done the "cleaning"

562
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,039
You'll have to get a nice gift for
Agustina, she's behaved properly

563
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,560
Much better than you sister did

564
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:30,764
It's shocking she didn't go to the funeral!

565
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:33,566
If you'd heard
what Squinty said about her!

566
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,804
Thank God you came

567
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,879
I'm sore from that ride

568
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:45,639
Are you staying the night?
- Where else would I go?

569
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:50,036
Ugh! I look terrible.
No wonder you were scared!

570
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:54,366
Do you still have the illegal hair salon?
- Of course, that's how I make a living

571
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,877
Is that the guest room?

572
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:57,957
Yes, that's it.

573
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,122
Tomorrow, give me a haircut and dye my hair.

574
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:03,278
And I'll need sunglasses

575
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:07,326
I don't want to be
stuck in the house all day.
I have to go out.

576
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:09,525
Nobody knows me here.

577
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:12,520
In the village, I couldn't
even go to the front door.

578
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:14,519
I need some fresh air

579
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,359
Are you staying long?

580
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:23,606
You want to get rid of me already?
- No, just asking...

581
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:27,922
I'm not planning to leave anytime soon,
if you don't mind

582
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:32,919
When you get tired of me,
just let me know.

583
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:36,875
But a for separated woman, who would
be better company than her mother?

584
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:40,564
Unless you've got a boyfriend...

585
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:42,481
No, Mom.

586
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,164
I'm alone, as usual.

587
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:46,716
Not anymore.

588
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:50,242
Answer the phone.

589
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:54,797
- Are you back yet?
- Yes, I am.

590
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,522
You were out of range,
so I phoned Agustina.

591
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,359
She said everything went very well.

592
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:01,085
The whole village came.

593
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:03,921
I've been thinking about you all day.

594
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:07,602
I would have loved to be there.
Hold on a second, Sole...

595
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:08,877
300, right?

596
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:13,686
What do I owe you for the drinks?
- Nothing, drinks are on the house.

597
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:18,245
OK then... Same time tomorrow?
Everyone in the crew was very happy

598
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:19,237
Glad to hear it.

599
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:21,762
and if you don't mind,
even if you have to charge more

600
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:24,441
could the portions could be a bit larger?

601
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:27,679
Tomorrow I'll feed you until you burst.

602
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:30,123
Great. See you tomorrow, then.
- See you tomorrow

603
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:36,396
Sorry, Sole...
- Did you get a job in a restaurant?

604
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:38,762
Yes, I took over Emilio's.

605
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:40,246
Oh!

606
00:43:40,407 --> 00:43:43,877
He was sick of it,
but that's not the only news...

607
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:45,036
Paco left us.

608
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:47,158
That's why I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

609
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,079
When you called,
we were in the middle of an argument.

610
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:51,442
I knew there was something wrong

611
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:55,517
Did he beat you?
- No, he wasn't violent

612
00:43:56,207 --> 00:43:57,640
He just left.

613
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,561
Forever.

614
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:01,435
He'll be back, you'll see.

615
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:03,436
I seriously doubt it.

616
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,596
How can you be so sure?

617
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,280
Call it intuition.

618
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:10,037
All right, kiss, kiss

619
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,603
To you, too.
- Bye

620
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:18,204
You know, none of us
have had any luck with men.

621
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,642
Raimunda and I haven't
but you...

622
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:22,442
Me, what?

623
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:24,240
Dad adored you.

624
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:27,321
Raimunda said you were lucky

625
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:30,485
because you died in the arms
of the person you loved most.

626
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:33,798
Raimunda is not a bad person,
but she's got a nasty streak.

627
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,759
I was blindly in love with your father.

628
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:39,078
and he cheated on me
until the day he died!

629
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,956
What are you saying, Mom?

630
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,595
It's true. I've kept that quiet all my life.

631
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,485
I never wanted you two to know.

632
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:49,322
But let's drop it. I don't want
to speak ill of the dead.

633
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:52,562
- Is his ghost going to appear?
- I hope not.

634
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,481
How about your husband?

635
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:56,601
What about my husband?

636
00:44:56,887 --> 00:45:00,122
Could he show up here any day?
- I don't think so.

637
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:02,722
I haven't heard from him
in two years.

638
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:06,084
All the better,
that way it'll just be the two of us

639
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:59,882
The pork was 10?
- 10.80.

640
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:03,316
- I'll give you an extra 3 euros.
- Thanks, Mundi.

641
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:06,684
And I'll pay you for 4 boxes of
cookies instead of three.

642
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,361
Thank you.
- I don't want you to think that I took advantage of you

643
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:14,643
Can you give me a hand with this?
I can't move it on my own.

644
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:16,282
Where are you taking it?

645
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:17,846
To the restaurant

646
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,475
You're the moving expert, tell us how...

647
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,719
Get ahold of it,
tip it over, but not all the way.

648
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:25,878
Otherwise, we won't get it through.

649
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,718
Is this all right?

650
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:30,005
Yes, straighten up, veer a bit to your right,
more to the right...

651
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,919
We can't see anything.

652
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:33,156
I'll guide you.

653
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,397
Now, careful, it'll come this way.

654
00:46:35,807 --> 00:46:37,638
All the way...

655
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:39,196
Don't rush it

656
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:42,080
Are we at the door?

657
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:46,206
Yes, OK. Let's go, the elevator is here

658
00:46:46,727 --> 00:46:49,764
Wait, wait.
This has to go in straight.

659
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:51,565
I'll take this end.

660
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:52,956
You take it.

661
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,242
That's it, that's it...

662
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:55,681
My God, what an ordeal!

663
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:56,597
Ouch!

664
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,677
Careful!

665
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:00,316
My God!

666
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,244
Press the button downstairs

667
00:47:07,247 --> 00:47:09,761
I want them to see that
we don't use frozen food

668
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,918
It's all natural, fresh every day

669
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:13,315
Over to the corner

670
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:14,642
and the other freezer?

671
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:15,717
That's not working

672
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:18,162
Right, so you're taking over the restaurant?

673
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:21,478
At least until yesterday's customers
finish their movie

674
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:23,046
Then I'll see.

675
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:26,404
You can count on me.
I make great desserts.

676
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:28,882
And I could serve drinks at night!

677
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:32,603
I don't know yet if we'll work nights,
but I'm counting on both of you.

678
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,483
- Sure
- Thanks a lot

679
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:39,003
Mom?

680
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:40,077
Hm?

681
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,321
There's something you want me to do, right?

682
00:47:45,647 --> 00:47:47,000
Cut my hair.

683
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,681
I mean...

684
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:54,284
...is there anything you couldn't do
while you were alive,

685
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:56,677
that's still bothering you

686
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:00,802
There's always things
that are left unfinished,

687
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,520
or badly done

688
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:05,198
And my life was no exception

689
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:08,363
but I don't know if things can be fixed,

690
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,286
And even if they can,

691
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:12,279
it is up to me to fix them

692
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,999
Customers will start arriving any minute now.
What will we do?

693
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:20,961
Attend to them. I'll help you.

694
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:24,876
I can't introduce you as my mother,
everyone knows I'm an orphan.

695
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:27,243
I can pretend I'm a foreigner

696
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,682
A foreigner? From where?

697
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:31,841
The Dominican Republic?

698
00:48:32,007 --> 00:48:35,716
No, that won't work. Too many in the
neighborhood, they'll notice your accent's all wrong.

699
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:40,081
Chinese?
Madrid is full of Chinese people

700
00:48:40,247 --> 00:48:43,125
Now who's going to believe
that you're Chinese, Mom?

701
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:45,443
We need something rare,
that's not in the neighborhood.

702
00:48:46,447 --> 00:48:47,482
Russian!

703
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:53,481
Do you really think I look more Russian
than Chinese?

704
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:55,877
Yes, Russians look just like us.

705
00:48:56,687 --> 00:49:00,123
Look, whatever you hear,
keep your mouth shut.

706
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,241
and don't make it obvious
that you understand

707
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,766
I'll show you how everything works
In the main room I cut, dry and color

708
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:09,918
In here I do the hair washing

709
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:13,116
If the customer is tall,
remove the pillow.

710
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,005
If she's short, you use it.

711
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:17,921
This towel is so you won't slip.

712
00:49:19,047 --> 00:49:20,366
I have this here

713
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:23,246
because up there is not handy,
and if I leave it down

714
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:26,956
I have to bend down so many times
it kills my back

715
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:29,516
Yeah, my back hurts me, too

716
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:32,679
The shampoo is automatically dispensed.
Have a seat, Mom.

717
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,558
Are you OK?
- Yes

718
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,639
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

719
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:44,081
I know the feeling...

720
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,636
Afterwards, with the same towel,

721
00:49:46,807 --> 00:49:50,004
you dry her a bit,
so it won't drip down her back

722
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:53,000
You've got everything so well organized...

723
00:49:59,127 --> 00:49:59,877
Hi

724
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:01,162
Hello.
- Hi dear

725
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,962
- Hi
- Hello

726
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:07,719
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian

727
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:09,445
Oh! they're having a terrible time,
the poor things

728
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,359
Yes, I took her in out of charity.

729
00:50:11,527 --> 00:50:14,564
When I saw her begging in the street,
she reminded me of my mother.

730
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:16,843
Don't trust all the old women you see

731
00:50:17,007 --> 00:50:20,522
Especially Russians. Most of them are in the mafia.
You're too good, people take advantage of you

732
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:22,723
You want highlights? Sit here

733
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:27,716
Wash hair, right?
She was a hairdresser back in Russia.

734
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:29,479
How do understand each other?

735
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,717
With gestures. She's very smart,
as sharp as a tack!

736
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:33,957
She'll be speaking Spanish in no time

737
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:37,278
I wouldn't be surprised... look how many
Russian top models are there nowadays

738
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:38,402
Dear me!

739
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:45,317
So Russian then?...
- Russia

740
00:50:51,727 --> 00:50:53,126
The water...

741
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:54,163
Not hot...

742
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:55,961
not cold... no

743
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:58,562
Very good

744
00:51:08,363 --> 00:51:09,363
Thank you

745
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:15,277
Hi

746
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,282
What's up?

747
00:51:18,127 --> 00:51:19,606
We have tomorrow off

748
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:23,085
Then, so do we.
We're due for a break.

749
00:51:23,687 --> 00:51:25,803
And we finish up next week.

750
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:28,561
We want to have
the wrap party here.

751
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:32,481
That's great! Do you want a 
sit-down meal or a buffet?

752
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,285
A buffet would be great.

753
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:38,680
And we'd like to have
the terrace just for us.

754
00:51:38,847 --> 00:51:41,236
Sure, no problem, I can do that.

755
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:47,000
And don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

756
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,680
likewise

757
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,641
Go and get yourself a drink,
I have work to do.

758
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:52,876
OK

759
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:58,285
Since she came back from the village,
she sounds strange over the phone.

760
00:51:58,447 --> 00:52:00,802
If she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

761
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:02,036
Which is the actually the truth

762
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:03,959
Paula, the less you know, the better

763
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:06,687
And, above all, try not to think about it

764
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,037
Hello.

765
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:21,478
Hello.
Hi

766
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,803
Do you have company?
- No

767
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:25,843
I'm going to the bathroom

768
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:27,281
The bathroom, what for?

769
00:52:28,007 --> 00:52:29,122
I have to pee.

770
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:32,442
It's out of order.
I'm waiting for the plumber.

771
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,679
I'll throw some water down,
I really need to go, for heaven's sake.

772
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:39,476
Uh, Hello.

773
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,200
And what's with you?

774
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,406
I'm at a difficult age

775
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,240
Same as myself!
I'll trim your hair a little

776
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:49,522
Don't, I can see you coming

777
00:52:49,687 --> 00:52:50,756
Just the split ends

778
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:52,326
Less than an inch

779
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:00,156
Listen...

780
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,520
Is your father back yet?

781
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:05,679
Nope. He said goodbye forever.

782
00:53:06,927 --> 00:53:09,999
That's incredible.
I just don't understand.

783
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,006
Yuck, it stinks in here!

784
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:23,437
And your mother?
- What?

785
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:26,280
She's such a pain!
Ever since she was a child.

786
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:29,560
Realize that in those days
we didn't have a bathroom

787
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,078
We did our business in the backyard

788
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:34,363
We had to be constantly waiting for her

789
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:37,200
She spent all day long in the backyard,
with the chickens

790
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:39,636
Raimunda!

791
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:08,961
Raimunda.

792
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:14,840
What's this robe doing here?

793
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:16,886
It's Mom's

794
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:18,560
I know.

795
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:21,926
And that smell!

796
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,636
What smell?

797
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,559
In the bathroom, and in here!

798
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:30,558
It's like she was just here farting
up a storm...!

799
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:31,921
Don't you smell it?

800
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:37,720
My God, she cut some killers!

801
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:43,723
And she could never hide it
because she was the first to crack up!

802
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:49,358
It's as if I can hear her laughing now.

803
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:53,240
Don't be silly!

804
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:02,517
Why did you bring these clothes?

805
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:04,564
No wonder you have nightmares.

806
00:55:04,727 --> 00:55:08,721
Dead people's clothes should be given away.
- Right

807
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,243
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

808
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,799
The antique dolls!

809
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,679
Her jewelry case!

810
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,192
What were you planning to do with all this?

811
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,036
Nothing.

812
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,397
- Nothing? You were going to keep it! 
Who would've said, Sole...

813
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,312
Raimunda, please, it's not what you think

814
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,279
I didn't bring the suitcase.

815
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,869
Yeah, right! Then how did it get here?

816
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,958
When I arrived at Aunt Paula's...

817
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,030
What?

818
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,437
Look, if they had told me
I wouldn't have believed it

819
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,188
Stealing the few things she had


820
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,318
before she was even in the grave.
You should be ashamed of yourself!

821
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,552
Raimunda, don't leave this way!

822
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,750
We have to buy another fridge.

823
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,989
Why don't you repair the one in the storeroom?

824
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,719
That one is no good.

825
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,431
Well, the motor's making a noise.

826
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,760
I told you nobody goes in there,
including you.

827
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,554
I saw the door was open
and went in to get a hammer.

828
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,799
Has anyone else gone in there?

829
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,509
I don't think so.

830
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,716
Mom, you said
you got rid of him

831
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,559
Well I couldn't, Paula

832
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,954
Do you think I like
having him in there?

833
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,874
Paula, get ready,
they'll be here in half an hour.

834
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,315
Paula?

835
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,955
What is this?
How come you're still like that?

836
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,839
I'm not in a party mood.

837
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,070
Me neither, but it's work

838
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,919
Don't be lazy.

839
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,590
Come on, I'll give you a hand

840
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,549
What's wrong?

841
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,708
I can't get him out of my head,
having him there, in the storeroom

842
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,310
That's the best way for you to go mad,
and to drive me crazy, too.

843
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,438
Mom, you don't know what it's like
to have killed your own father.

844
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,477
Paco was not your father.

845
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,558
Stop lying to me.

846
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,996
I know you're doing it for me,
but please, just stop lying to me

847
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,275
I'm not lying to you

848
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,911
Paco took you as his daughter

849
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,799
but he knew that he was not
your biological father

850
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,591
So he was telling the truth then?

851
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,310
Yes, but that doesn't justify what he did

852
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,551
Paula, I promise I'll tell you
everything, I swear, but some other time

853
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,352
Now let's get ready.
We won't fix anything staying here

854
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,599
So who was my father?

855
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,395
A guy from the village.

856
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,675
Do I know him?

857
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,034
He's dead

858
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,475
Paula, I swear that I'll tell you
everything, but later.

859
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,919
I'll hold you to your word on that

860
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,594
- Two mojitos!
- Two mojitos coming up!

861
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,554
What would you like, handsome?
Two mojitos as well?

862
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,719
With lemon.
It's perfect.

863
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,716
We need more glasses

864
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,233
I can hardly keep up.

865
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,152
Doesn't Paula look pretty?

866
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,038
 

867
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,274
Here...
- Thanks.

868
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,679
How scrumptious!

869
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,717
I'm not drinking anymore, they're too good!

870
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,589
Between your cleavage and my mojitos
we can make a fortune

871
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,877
We should stay open nights
and try to liven up... 

872
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,359
...this lousy neighborhood.

873
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,272
We'll talk about it, but for now the important
thing is...

874
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,829
...that they're satisfied tonight.
Have a mojito!

875
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,757
Stay down, so they don't see you.

876
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,593
I'd love to see Raimunda
and Paula.

877
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,630
The other day I could only see their feet

878
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,518
And look at the fuss you caused!

879
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,874
Is that the restaurant?

880
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,111
She said she was doing well,
but I never imagined this!

881
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,793
She deserves it.

882
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,837
The poor thing has suffered a lot

883
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,788
Don't get out of the car,
and stay down, and don't let anyone see you.

884
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,393
No one can see me here!

885
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,872
What are you doing here?
I'm glad to see you.

886
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,079
I brought you Aunt Paula's things.
I didn't know you were having a party.

887
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,549
It's the film crew's party,
celebrating the end of the shoot

888
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,836
I've been catering for them.

889
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,436
Let's put away the suitcase
Why did you bother?

890
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,999
It would have never occurred to me

891
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,879
To take anything from Auntie,
much less hiding it from you

892
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,678
I know, I'm sorry for what I said

893
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,070
But you know me, I fly off the handle.

894
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,876
Hi, Auntie
- Hi

895
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,589
Would you like anything?
- No, thank you.

896
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,671
Tacata, tacata

897
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,116
I can see the twinkling

898
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,111
of the distant lights

899
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,430
guiding my return

900
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,795
You remember?

901
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,032
How could I forget?

902
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,595
It's been so long since I heard you sing!

903
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,150
I've never heard her sing

904
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,113
Really?
- Yes Mom, really

905
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,719
And would you like to, my dear?

906
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,791
What do you think? Of course!

907
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,395
Come on!

908
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,594
I can't believe it.

909
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,709
Where should I sit?

910
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,596
There

911
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,031
Quiet! Sit down, this woman is going to sing!

912
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,754
Good evening.

913
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,517
I would like to thank the crew

914
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,035
for the work you've given us
these past weeks.

915
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,518
Thank you very much, with all my heart.

916
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,196
I haven't sung for a long, long time

917
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,990
but I'll give it a try
and see how it goes.

918
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,315
I'm afraid of the encounter

919
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,797
the past that is coming back 

920
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,713
to confront my life

921
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,395
Your grandmother
taught your mother this song

922
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,869
for the young talent audition

923
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,390
I'm afraid of the nights

924
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,191
that, full of memories

925
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,794
enchain my dreams

926
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,676
but the fleeing traveller 

927
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,151
sooner or later must come to a halt

928
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,676
and even though oblivion,
which destroys everything

929
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,912
has shattered my illusions

930
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,840
I keep holding on to
a humble hope

931
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,875
And that is all 
of my heart's fortune

932
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,271
Coming back

933
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,040
with a wrinkled forehead

934
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,758
the snows of time

935
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,878
silvering my temple

936
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,474
feeling

937
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,149
that life is an instant,

938
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,190
that 20 years is nothing,

939
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,998
that the feverish eyes,

940
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,152
wandering in the shadows
looks for you and names you

941
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,151
Living

942
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,235
With my soul clinging

943
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,152
to a sweet memory

944
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,276
that I weep for again

945
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,755
Bravo!

946
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,794
Autos Amigo, can I help you?

947
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,398
Hi, good morning. I'm calling about your ad

948
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,200
I'd like to rent a van

949
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,551
What kind and for how long?

950
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,917
The cheapest one you have.
It's just for one day.

951
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,996
Hello?
- Can I speak to Mrs. Raimunda?

952
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,635
Speaking.

953
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,834
Mr. Emilio gave me your number
so you could show me the restaurant.

954
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,719
I've been trying to see it for a few days now.
My name is Carlos.

955
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,949
The thing is...

956
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,830
Pity you didn't call earlier.

957
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,878
because a neighbor has taken it over.

958
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,430
But Mr. Emilio didn't tell me anything about that.

959
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,709
Of course, he has his strategies,
just in case

960
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,758
Could I talk to the person that took it?

961
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,235
This is her day off, I'm sorry

962
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,756
If you call Mr. Emilio, I'm sure
he'll explain everything to you

963
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,469
OK. Thank you.

964
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,949
Good bye.

965
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,836
Hello?
- Emilio, hi. It's Raimunda.

966
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,356
Good to hear from you!
Did a man go to see the restaurant?

967
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,274
Yes, but I got a bad feeling about him.
I think he wants it as a cover

968
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,759
A cover? For what?

969
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,832
For drugs, to set up a brothel... I don't know

970
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,675
When I told him that the business wasn't
doing well, he said that was even better

971
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,956
How could you say that?

972
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,114
Look, Emilio, I wanted to call you days ago

973
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,238
and I hope that you understand me

974
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,269
I know I'm not supposed to do things this way but...

975
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,430
I kept the restaurant for myself.

976
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,113
You did? What do you mean?

977
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,956
If you give me five minutes, I can explain to you

978
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,794
You went too far, Raimunda, way too far

979
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,949
Yes

980
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,872
You took advantage of my trust in you

981
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,878
I know it's no excuse,
but when the film crew showed up

982
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,749
I was desperate,
and now that Paco left us.

983
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,114
Paco left you?

984
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,359
Yes. We had a big fight

985
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,995
He left and I don't think he's coming back

986
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,754
He left the same day
you left to Barcelona.

987
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,158
How are you coping with it?

988
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,757
Me? I'm hysterical.
Clutching at straws.

989
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,793
Well, OK, so... we'll try to sort it out

990
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,636
Tell me how much I owe you for a month's rent
and I'll send it to you, but give me a few days

991
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,749
Yes?
- Raimunda?

992
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,474
Yes, who is it?

993
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,757
It's Agustina. I'm in Madrid,
and I'd like to see you.

994
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,238
Agustina, today is a bad day, I'm very busy

995
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,316
And tomorrow?

996
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,074
No, the whole week is a real mess.

997
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,198
Don't tell me that, I'm in the hospital.

998
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,794
What happened?

999
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,918
I've got cancer. The doctors told me yesterday

1000
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,752
I need to see you.

1001
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,520
Tell me which hospital you're in,
and I'll come by today.

1002
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,079
I'm in the Central Hospital

1003
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,395
God bless you for this, Raimunda.

1004
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,999
Thanks.

1005
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,073
You go up, I'm in a hurry.
Give this to your aunt

1006
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:11,756
Hi, Auntie.

1007
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,114
- What are you doing here?

1008
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,873
Sole!

1009
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,155
Sole!

1010
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,153
Is that your mother shouting?

1011
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,558
Sole, come to the window!

1012
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:23,996
What?

1013
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,553
I'm leaving Paula with you!

1014
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,312
Raimunda, I've got work to do.

1015
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,950
I have to go to the hospital.
Agustina has cancer.

1016
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,076
That's terrible! Poor thing!

1017
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,391
Paula has Aunt Paula's suitcase, 
you keep it.

1018
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,791
I'm going to run errands, I'll be back
as soon as I'm finished

1019
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,271
Say hi to Agustina.
Tell her that you saw me

1020
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,793
Yes, nuisance.

1021
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,478
Can I come in now, Auntie?

1022
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,388
Yes, sweetie, come on in.

1023
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,589
How are you, dear?

1024
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,310
They opened me up and then closed me again

1025
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,552
I knew that I had something bad

1026
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,597
Don't lose hope.

1027
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,992
The flowers are beautiful

1028
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,917
You shouldn't have bothered
Put them there...

1029
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,829
Raimunda,

1030
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,352
I have to ask you for a favor.

1031
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,511
Whatever you want, Agustina.

1032
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,554
Close the door.

1033
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,989
Grab a chair.

1034
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,472
I don't have much time left.

1035
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,911
But I don't want to die without knowing
what happened to my mother.

1036
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,192
But what can I do?

1037
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,350
You can tell me
if she's dead or alive.

1038
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,034
And how would I know?

1039
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,033
Ask your mother.

1040
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,439
My mother?
But she's dead, Agustina!

1041
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,917
I know. But she appeared to your Aunt Paula

1042
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,357
and she took care of her until she died.
The whole village knows.

1043
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,670
If she appears to you,
ask her about my mother.

1044
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,998
That's all I'm asking from you.

1045
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,789
Agustina, what you're asking me is insane.
Did you ever see her...

1046
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,154
...with your own eyes?

1047
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,710
No.

1048
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,791
Then, since you live across the street,
and never saw her...

1049
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,272
I think she hid from me.

1050
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,037
But I heard your aunt a thousand times,
God bless her, talking to her

1051
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,031
Look, if I find out anything, I'll be sure to tell you.

1052
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,752
But it's quite unlikely

1053
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,712
You owe it to me, Raimunda

1054
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,239
I'm only asking you for this one thing

1055
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,198
OK, I have to go, I have a lot of things to do.

1056
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,591
Wait, my sister wants to see you.
She'll be here any minute.

1057
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,433
Some other day.
I really have to go.

1058
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,875
She wants you to go on TV.

1059
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,397
You know she works on
"Wherever You Are"

1060
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,950
They want to produce a special
and they thought of you

1061
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,954
Since you were friends as children,
and you both went to the audition...

1062
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,790
...with all that, they figure they have 
enough for three or four programs...

1063
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,996
...with interviews, music and songs...

1064
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,391
...from all the time you've known each other.

1065
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,313
Tell your sister that I don't like TV.

1066
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,751
Me neither. I'll tell her.
But don't forget what I asked you

1067
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,269
OK, I won't

1068
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,673
The Russian really likes watching TV!

1069
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,677
I'm not sure what she understands,
but she's glued to it.

1070
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,390
There's something about trash TV.

1071
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,950
Myself, when I sit in front of it,
I can't quit watching.

1072
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,317
I feel worse every minute,
but I can't get up

1073
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,879
It's like a drug

1074
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,999
I had to stop watching it at night,
because I slept so badly afterwards

1075
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,276
All that screaming drives you crazy.

1076
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,913
Do you like dolls?

1077
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,596
I like these, they look like
they're from a horror movie.

1078
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,193
They're quite ancient.

1079
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,875
Your mom played with them
when she was pregnant with you

1080
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,598
Why didn't Mom live with you?

1081
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,836
We were broke

1082
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,629
Your grandfather went to work in Venezuela

1083
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,438
I kept Sole

1084
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,833
and your mother moved in with Aunt Paula.

1085
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,079
What has she told you?

1086
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,391
Nothing, she doesn't like talking about that time

1087
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,553
Do you get along well?

1088
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,119
Better now

1089
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,555
But she's unbearable at times, grandma

1090
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,869
She's got a strong personality.
And a temper.

1091
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,271
How did you get along with her?

1092
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,399
As a child she was the apple of my eye

1093
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,390
but when she was a teenager...

1094
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,396
for some reason I didn't know

1095
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,238
she grew away from me

1096
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,671
until I lost her completely.

1097
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,112
Your mother didn't love me.

1098
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,835
It's very painful when a daughter
doesn't love her own mother.

1099
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,595
That's why now that it's just the two of you,

1100
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,797
you have to love her very much,

1101
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,872
so there's no way she can miss it.

1102
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,676
Why have you come back, Grandma?

1103
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,271
Because I felt very lonely.

1104
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:39,870
Good afternoon

1105
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,276
Hello

1106
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,877
I'd like 8 meters of plastic clothes line 

1107
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,433
And some packing tape

1108
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,715
How much tape?

1109
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,439
Maybe 4 or 5 rolls

1110
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,635
Very well

1111
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,708
Here's five

1112
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,791
One,

1113
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,151
two...

1114
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,835
And a pick and a shovel

1115
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,275
Sure

1116
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,988
Sole, see you later

1117
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,513
Thanks

1118
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,029
Hi. It's your sister

1119
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,997
How are you, Raimunda?

1120
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,356
Fed up.

1121
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,629
How's Agustina?

1122
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,433
She's lost it completely.

1123
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,316
Hi, Mom.

1124
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,873
And what's wrong with you?

1125
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,029
Nothing.

1126
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,551
Go on, honey, bring me a glass of water

1127
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,753
Can she stay with you tonight?

1128
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,672
Sure, but where should I put her?

1129
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,359
In the spare room.

1130
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,917
Paco's coming home tonight
He wants us to talk

1131
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,759
and I'd like to be alone.

1132
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,596
Sure.

1133
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,668
You're staying here tonight.

1134
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,516
Okay, I'm off, I've got a long night
ahead of me.

1135
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,589
Hello!

1136
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,636
- Hi!
- What's up?

1137
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,916
I need you to do me a favor tonight.

1138
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,150
Tonight? Can't it wait until tomorrow?

1139
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,788
No. But I'll pay you
like a regular customer.

1140
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,429
No, sweetie, I'll give you a discount.

1141
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,072
But girl, I didn't know that you liked pussy.

1142
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,195
I don't!

1143
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,228
You don't? So if it's not for fooling around,
what do you want from me?

1144
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,959
I'll tell you on the way

1145
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,714
We have to put the freezer locker in the van

1146
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,472
And take it out to the country

1147
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,710
We can't manage that
just the two of us

1148
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,916
We'll get the neighbors to help.

1149
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,355
Wear something comfortable.
I'll wait for you on the terrace

1150
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,270
Like what?

1151
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,271
Something you don't look like
you're about to burst out of

1152
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,476
Wait! Hold on a second

1153
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,868
It sticks out here.

1154
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,109
Get it on the sidewalk.

1155
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,952
It's slipping!

1156
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,271
No, it's not.

1157
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,555
Keep it moving

1158
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,476
Now we have to align it

1159
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,910
One, two, three... UP!

1160
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,755
Come on, on the count of three.
One, two,  

1161
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,716
Three!

1162
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,915
Push!

1163
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,675
Ouch!

1164
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,479
That's it, It's in!

1165
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,799
Fuck this shit!

1166
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,439
Did you hurt yourself?

1167
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,751
No. What do I need the arm for, anyway?

1168
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,475
Come on

1169
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,674
Where are we going?

1170
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,318
To the Jucar river

1171
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,198
And where's that?
- About 180 kilometers away.

1172
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,148
180 kilometers? It'll take us the whole night
just going there and back

1173
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,992
I told you I'll pay you by the hour

1174
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,759
Only for coming along with you?

1175
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,554
To come with me to the river, dig a hole,

1176
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,109
bury the freezer, and not ask questions...

1177
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,472
Look, Mundita, I appreciate your trust in me,

1178
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,029
but my life is already troubled enough!

1179
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,351
I have no job, no papers,
I have to work the streets to survive

1180
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,431
Christ, you could've just asked me!

1181
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,477
OK, I'm asking you now, tell me how much
- Still...

1182
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,835
You should've asked first

1183
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,389
Okay, then...

1184
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,949
Give me the nights

1185
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,635
What nights?

1186
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,235
The drinks at night, for a month.

1187
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,309
And I keep what I make from my cocktails. 
And you buy the bottles.

1188
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,036
OK, partner, but not a word
about this to anyone, OK?

1189
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,389
What choice do I have! I'm your accomplice now.

1190
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,391
If it makes you feel better,
I haven't killed anyone.

1191
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,039
No, don't tell me anything about it.

1192
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,312
I wasn't going to tell you...

1193
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,719
Move aside.
Move, move, move. Give me that.

1194
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,033
Wait...

1195
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,749
Oh, my God!

1196
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,197
I can't do any more, I'm dead.

1197
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,075
You take a break, I'll fill it in.

1198
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,718
What are you doing here, Agustina?

1199
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,754
Can we talk?

1200
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,273
I'm very busy

1201
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,709
Okay, come in, come

1202
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,673
How's your thing?

1203
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,195
The same. Did you find out anything?

1204
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,349
About what?

1205
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,358
About what I asked you.

1206
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,356
I didn't think you were serious.

1207
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,272
Do you mind if I sit down?

1208
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,678
Oh, Raimunda...

1209
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,798
Have pity on me.

1210
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,359
I do, all the pity you want,
but don't ask for crazy things.

1211
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,909
I just want to know if she's dead or alive!

1212
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,632
Agustina, I understand that
between the wind and the cancer

1213
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,472
you've lost your mind

1214
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,518
but that doesn't give you the right
to complicate our lives

1215
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,432
They're complicated enough already!

1216
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,513
The day your parents died in the fire,

1217
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,671
my mother disappeared from town

1218
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,754
Doesn't that strike you as a big coincidence?

1219
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,435
Not really, it's just a coincidence

1220
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,033
According to you, your mother
left in the morning

1221
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,000
and it wasn't the first time she disappeared

1222
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,835
Your grandmother had to raise you
because she was never home!

1223
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,877
Don't make me say more.

1224
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,758
My mother went off that morning,

1225
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,233
but it was to join your father
in the shack.

1226
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,400
That's a lie.
No one saw her.

1227
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,030
Of course, she was careful not to be seen

1228
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,075
Raimunda,

1229
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,515
My mother was having an affair with your father

1230
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,118
What are you talking about?

1231
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,038
My mother adored my father,
she would never have allowed it.

1232
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,839
That's why she left him,
and moved in with Aunt Paula.

1233
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,674
She went to live with her
because my aunt was not well.

1234
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:19,559
But she never left my father.
She divided her time between the two houses.

1235
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,472
You don't know, because you weren't there

1236
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,712
and you hardly had any contact
with your mother for years.

1237
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,350
She always complained that
you treated her like shit.
Those were her very words.

1238
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,318
I've heard lots of things.

1239
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,634
I once overheard your mother
and mine arguing.

1240
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:42,233
Your mother told her she could have your father,
she didn't care.

1241
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,992
And she didn't envy her

1242
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,232
because he'd been born
to hurt the women who loved him.

1243
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,191
What are you trying to prove, Agustina?

1244
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,392
That your parents' death

1245
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,833
and my mother's disappearance
are connected.

1246
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,074
Then, why haven't you gone to the police?

1247
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,755
Because the police ask too many questions,

1248
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,037
and we should wash
our dirty laundry at home.

1249
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,270
That's why I don't want to go on TV,
even though my sister keeps insisting

1250
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,878
You and I have to sort this out.

1251
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,550
Agustina, I have to go back to work.

1252
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,037
Think about what I said.

1253
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,318
How's Paco?

1254
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:31,875
He's fine

1255
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,955
Good 

1256
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,033
Shouldn't we call Auntie
to say we're coming?

1257
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,599
She never leaves home

1258
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,114
We should warn her

1259
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,675
What for?

1260
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,231
It's not polite to show up at
someone's home without calling first,

1261
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,833
even if it's your sister.

1262
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,195
What's with you and Aunt Sole now?

1263
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,431
It's a matter of good manners, Mom.

1264
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,913
Look, you can fuck off, you and your auntie!

1265
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,433
You're gross!

1266
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,359
What have you brought, Raimunda?

1267
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,353
- Lunch for three

1268
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:14,877
What am I going to do with him now in my house,
all summer long, as hyper as he is

1269
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,712
Why did you bother?

1270
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,235
Why are you shouting?
Are you going deaf?

1271
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,276
 
Deaf as a post, yes! 

1272
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,274
We'll stay for a while
and I'd like you to cut my hair

1273
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,074
Why didn't you call? I have a client.
 

1274
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,549
Don't worry, I'm not in a hurry. We need to talk.

1275
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,914
About what?

1276
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,957
Aunt Paula's house.

1277
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,792
Can I go watch TV?

1278
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,029
Go on...

1279
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,918
We need to decide what to do
and deal with the paperwork.

1280
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,436
Grandma?

1281
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,395
I'm here

1282
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,471
Don't make a sound, my mom's here

1283
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,119
I heard her

1284
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,199
Sole, where's the Russian?

1285
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,755
Who's the Russian?

1286
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,717
A woman who's helping me.

1287
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:05,156
I was telling her how my son's been expelled
from school again,

1288
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,312
He slashed the tires of the priest
who teaches him religion.

1289
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,870
I was telling her and she left me here,
talking to myself and without rinsing my hair

1290
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,399
She must have gone out.

1291
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,028
no shit... she practically vanished!

1292
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,992
I'll finish you up.

1293
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,196
She's got claustrophobia

1294
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,749
and at times
she has to go outside.

1295
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,990
Some help she is.
Do you pay her?

1296
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,356
Nope, I took her in.

1297
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,913
She eats and sleeps here
I gave her Mom's clothes

1298
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,719
I don't like you taking in
complete strangers.

1299
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,111
We told her that.
People take advantage of her.

1300
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,556
Look at the Russian.
She's living in luxury here.

1301
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,154
How did it go with Paco the other night?

1302
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,709
Very bad. He came home to collect his clothes.

1303
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,557
I think he's moved in with someone,
but I don't know where, and couldn't care less.

1304
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,910
Why didn't you tell me that you had a Russian?

1305
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,598
I don't know, it must've slipped my mind.

1306
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,914
Look! It's Agustina on TV!

1307
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,311
Good afternoon, Agustina.

1308
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,595
Good afternoon

1309
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,276
We know from your sister that your mother 
had you when she was a single, isn't that right?

1310
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,319
Yes. The thing is... my mom was a hippie...

1311
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,353
It's Agustina!

1312
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,794
...and she never married

1313
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,750
Right, so, she practiced free love

1314
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,558
Your mother had a girlfriend

1315
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,156
who died on the same day
that she disappeared, isn't that right?

1316
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,150
Yes

1317
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,399
How did this friend die?

1318
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,508
In a fire.

1319
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,069
They're common in our village

1320
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,918
because of the hot wind.

1321
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,399
Agustina's village is

1322
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,518
the wonderful Alcanfor de las Infantas.

1323
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,750
which, according to statistics,

1324
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,480
has the highest rate of lunatics per capita

1325
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,235
Agustina, do you think your mother suffered
from some kind of mental disorder?

1326
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,434
No, no, no, no.

1327
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,710
Mi mother, when she wasn't feeling well,

1328
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,599
since she was a hippie...she'd just leave the village, 

1329
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,789
Until one day she left
and never came back

1330
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,713
Yes, that was almost four years ago.

1331
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,717
And her friend? We're very interested
about that friend that died

1332
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,270
Right on the same day that your
mother disappeared. Tell us.

1333
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,475
Tell you what?

1334
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,959
Tell us about the woman
who died in the fire.

1335
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,872
You know there are rumors...

1336
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,712
I don't believe in rumors.

1337
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,077
I'd like you to explain
what you told our producer.

1338
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,071
Something about this woman and her husband,

1339
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,597
that linked them to 
your mother's disappearance.

1340
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,159
About that...

1341
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,835
...I'd rather not talk about that.

1342
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,237
Those were suppositions of mine.

1343
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,915
But that's what you came here for,

1344
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,799
to talk about that woman and your mother, right?

1345
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,678
Yes, but I've changed my mind.

1346
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,717
What's wrong? You look
uncomfortable, a bit nervous

1347
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,350
I'd also like to mention,
that Agustina also came here

1348
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,795
To tell us she's been diagnosed

1349
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,837
with a terminal illness, isn't that so?

1350
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,517
Agustina has cancer.

1351
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,193
Ow, ow, ow...

1352
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,072
You have cancer, Agustina

1353
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,119
But don't be nervous...
you're among friends.

1354
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,316
Come on, let's give her
a big hand.

1355
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,869
Agustina has a wish:

1356
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,156
To go to a private hospital in Houston.

1357
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,632
But to go to Houston,
you have to speak frankly.

1358
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,152
I remind you that you made
a commitment to this channel.

1359
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,949
Agustina!

1360
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,514
Agustina!

1361
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,709
 

1362
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,750
Agustina came to see me at the restaurant

1363
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,989
Really?

1364
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,435
She insists that
Mom appears to us.

1365
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,591
She wants me to ask her about her own mother.

1366
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,830
She also says that when she disappeared

1367
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,468
her mother was having an affair with Dad

1368
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,590
Do you know anything about that?

1369
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,469
No.

1370
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,198
Okay... Mother told me,
after...

1371
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,153
After what?

1372
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,788
After she found out

1373
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,554
Sole, look at me.

1374
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,273
Is there anything else I should know and I don't?

1375
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,279
Plenty...

1376
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,238
but if I tell you

1377
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,834
you'll get mad or you won't believe me

1378
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,238
I promise I will believe you and I won't get mad

1379
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,069
Mom has been appearing all the time.

1380
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,394
To who?

1381
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,470
Take a seat.

1382
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,709
She was with Aunt Paula until she died.

1383
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,715
She alerted Agustina
and opened the front door

1384
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,871
so she could find the body

1385
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,998
She been putting out the money
so they'd bring her daily bread

1386
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,639
and she arranged all the expenses of the funeral

1387
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,392
You did all that, Grandma?

1388
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,515
Yes.

1389
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,875
Who told you all that, Agustina did?

1390
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,992
See, you don't believe me.

1391
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,831
Sole, Agustina's lost it!

1392
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,638
The last time we saw Auntie

1393
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,394
you said yourself that it was incredible

1394
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,075
that she could manage so well,
half senile and half blind

1395
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,389
Don't you remember?

1396
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,196
I do, but what are you saying?

1397
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,917
Auntie was not alone.

1398
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,156
Who do you think made those donuts

1399
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,596
and had them packed in a container,
one for each of us?

1400
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,399
Who brought the dolls and Auntie's things

1401
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,028
before the neighbors looted the place?

1402
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,078
Do you understand now?

1403
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,673
Have you seen her?

1404
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,115
Yes.

1405
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,637
Is she by chance...

1406
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,915
...the Russian?

1407
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,189
Yes.

1408
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,439
Where is she?

1409
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,190
In there.

1410
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,669
Mama.

1411
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,959
What are you doing under there?

1412
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,996
Weren't you dead?

1413
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,116
I came back to ask for your forgiveness.

1414
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,951
I knew nothing about it, my dear

1415
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,718
I couldn't even imagine

1416
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,712
Come on, Paula

1417
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,269
Raimunda!

1418
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,993
My girl!

1419
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,194
My girl!

1420
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,953
The worst part is over

1421
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,273
she saw me

1422
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,358
and she didn't reject me, right?

1423
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,676
No she didn't

1424
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,598
Is it true that you came back
to ask for her forgiveness?

1425
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,195
And also to be with you.

1426
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,360
Will you explain to me one day what's going on?

1427
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:34,354
I will, and when that day comes
I hope you'll understand me, Sole,

1428
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,317
and that you'll also forgive me.

1429
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,635
Mom...

1430
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,875
Here.

1431
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,392
I have to talk to her.

1432
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,037
Why don't we go back.

1433
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,109
Now?

1434
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,755
Yes.

1435
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,069
I've dreamed of this so often!

1436
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,195
Me too.

1437
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,952
I don't know where to begin.

1438
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,152
You're not a ghost, right?
You're not dead.

1439
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,954
No, love, I'm not

1440
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,953
That's a relief

1441
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,352
But if I had died,

1442
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,431
I would've returned
to ask you for forgiveness

1443
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,273
for not seeing what was going on.

1444
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,359
I was blind.

1445
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,510
I found out on the day of the fire.

1446
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,717
Is it true that you had left dad?

1447
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,069
Yes.

1448
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,751
I couldn't put up with his cheating anymore.

1449
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,592
On the evening of the fire

1450
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,799
You called and talked to Auntie.

1451
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,909
And as usual, you didn't ask about me,

1452
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,590
I got angry and I told your aunt
that you were heartless,

1453
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,471
and as I continued berating you

1454
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,073
She defended you...

1455
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,597
...and told me everything

1456
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,270
That your father had raped you,

1457
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,517
that you'd gotten pregnant,

1458
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,555
and that Paula...

1459
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,152
is your daughter...

1460
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,271
...and your sister.

1461
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,472
I couldn't believe it.

1462
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,035
How could such a monstrous thing
happen right in front of me

1463
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,792
without me realizing it?

1464
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,394
Then I understood everything,

1465
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,871
your silence, your distance,

1466
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,190
and your coldness.

1467
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,031
I understood why your father
went to work in Venezuela.

1468
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,151
He couldn't cope with the shame
of what he'd done.

1469
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,679
I understood  

1470
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,430
why, after marrying Paco,

1471
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,234
you went to Madrid

1472
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,555
and wanted nothing to do with us.

1473
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,518
I hated you for not having noticed a thing, Mom.

1474
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,510
And you were completely right, my dear.

1475
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,999
When I found out,

1476
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,311
I was enraged

1477
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,672
I went to the shack ready to scratch his eyes out.

1478
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,832
and I found him asleep,  
with Agustina's mother,

1479
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,718
both of them worn out
from their exertions

1480
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,233
They didn't see me

1481
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,316
I set the shack on fire.

1482
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,672
It was a windy day,

1483
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,997
and within seconds the flames
had devoured everything.

1484
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,870
They didn't have time to wake up.

1485
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,755
So the ashes in your grave

1486
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,355
are Agustina's mother?

1487
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,235
Yes.

1488
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,679
Afterwards,

1489
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,557
I wandered the fields for a few days

1490
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,679
Hiding,

1491
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,673
like an animal.

1492
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,592
I was going to turn myself in,

1493
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,429
But first

1494
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,433
I went to see Paula,

1495
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,476
And found her in such bad shape...

1496
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,072
When she saw me,

1497
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,596
she wasn't a bit surprised

1498
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:50,152
I had come from the past, where she was living

1499
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,432
and she greeted me
as if I had just gone out the door

1500
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:59,512
The tragedy had taken away
the little sanity she had left.

1501
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,556
I couldn't leave her on her own...

1502
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,472
so I stayed to take care of her

1503
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,993
until she died.

1504
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,793
In the village
they think you're a ghost.

1505
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,998
That's one good thing
about such superstitious places.

1506
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,477
It was easier for me
to go along with them

1507
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,198
than to speak the truth.

1508
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,876
I thought I'd be arrested.

1509
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:30,471
I never imagined
that no one would investigate

1510
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,073
or punish me,

1511
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,439
although all this time

1512
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,713
I swear I've gone through purgatory

1513
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,516
in the real sense of the word.

1514
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,831
It's too early to go to the village.

1515
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,592
We shouldn't arrive in daylight.

1516
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,276
Why don't we drive by the river?
It's been so long since I saw it...

1517
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,556
Is not what it was Mom, it dried out.

1518
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,039
How do you know?

1519
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:22,631
Because there's drought all over Spain.
Sole, how can you be so clueless?

1520
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,670
We often came here for a picnic.
Do you remember, Raimunda?

1521
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,355
I do.

1522
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,316
The river was much wider then.

1523
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,072
I told you it dried up.

1524
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,954
Let's have a snack.

1525
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,749
Not for me.

1526
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,838
I'm having a donut.

1527
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,955
Me too.

1528
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:10,236
This was your father's favorite place.

1529
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,714
You mean Paco?

1530
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,070
Yes, him.

1531
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,355
It was the only place he really missed.

1532
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,715
This river.

1533
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,591
I'm glad he's resting here.

1534
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,751
Come on!
Nobody'll see you now!

1535
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:14,513
If only Paula could see us,

1536
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,792
all together...

1537
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,833
...she'd be so happy!

1538
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,753
Have you always had such big chest?

1539
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,837
Yes, Mom, ever since I was small.

1540
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,833
I remember them smaller.

1541
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,512
I hope you didn't do anything to them?

1542
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,870
What could I have done?
Don't say nonsense...

1543
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,115
Oh, OK...

1544
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,351
Grandma, was it you
that used the exercise bike?

1545
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,112
Yes. Half an hour every day

1546
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,635
It's good for your heart

1547
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,519
And what did Aunt Paula say when she saw you?

1548
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,318
She couldn't stop laughing.

1549
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,350
See you later.

1550
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,194
It's Aunt Paula!

1551
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,675
Knock it off, Sole.

1552
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,074
I'll see who it is.

1553
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,355
Hide Mom's plate and silverware

1554
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,950
Who is it?

1555
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,269
It's me, Agustina.

1556
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,076
We're having supper.
We just arrived.

1557
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,753
Sorry to interrupt.

1558
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,989
Come on in, don't just stand there.
- Thank you.

1559
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,510
Good evening
- Good evening

1560
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,995
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1561
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,633
I came to apologize about the TV show

1562
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,113
You shouldn't have gone Agustina,
it wasn't right.

1563
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,275
I know

1564
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:52,833
It's no excuse,

1565
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,195
but they offered to send me to Houston

1566
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,271
where, apparently, they cure everything.

1567
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,472
But I couldn't do it.

1568
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,991
I'd rather die alone in my house,
but at peace,

1569
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,197
and be able to look at you in the eye.

1570
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,349
Mom, I'll be upstairs, OK?
- Yes, go on.

1571
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,915
- Will you have some supper?
- No, no, thanks.

1572
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,111
I heard you're going to sell the house.
- Yes

1573
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,029
That was the idea, but once we got here,

1574
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,235
there are so many memories that I'm not sure...

1575
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,197
OK then, I better go.

1576
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,076
Stay for a while. Why hurry?

1577
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,871
I have to go see the nurse
to get my injection.

1578
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,316
In Madrid they told me I'd better
get used to doing it myself,

1579
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,232
but I find it disgusting.

1580
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:43,030
Your sister has no excuse for letting you
live on your own in your condition.

1581
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:44,758
Don't even mention her.

1582
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,114
After what happened on TV

1583
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,872
she won't even talk to me.

1584
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,470
She's very angry with me,
but I'm even more angry with her.

1585
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,314
You've plenty of reasons to be.

1586
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,833
I envy you two.

1587
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,198
You're so close.

1588
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,039
Irene!

1589
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,512
I couldn't wait to see you!

1590
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,034
Here I am.

1591
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,319
I heard about what happened

1592
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,554
and I guess you must be feeling pretty lonely.

1593
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:32,869
Very lonely.

1594
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,195
If only Paula were here.

1595
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,794
I'm here now to take care of you,
whatever it takes.

1596
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,757
You left the door open.

1597
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,395
Don't worry, I closed it.

1598
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,278
Did you go to the nurse?

1599
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,670
- No, I'm too tired, tomorrow.

1600
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,599
Tomorrow you'll be in a lot of pain.

1601
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,399
Do you have the medicine
and the needles?

1602
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,118
- Yes, I bought everything in Madrid.

1603
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,714
All right, I'll give you the shot.

1604
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,276
I was born in this bed.

1605
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,471
My mother slept here.

1606
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,836
And on this very bed, we held your sister Paula's wake.

1607
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,793
I know, Agustina

1608
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,152
and I'm deeply grateful for it.

1609
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,914
We have to talk, Irene.

1610
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,157
About anything you wish,

1611
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,870
but don't tell anyone that I've returned.

1612
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,275
Don't worry, I won't.

1613
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,078
Oh, and thank you for not
talking about me on TV.

1614
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,350
That's our business,

1615
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,559
Of course.

1616
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,030
And no one else's.

1617
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,111
It's me, Mom.
Open up.

1618
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,795
Raimunda, what are you doing here? Come in.

1619
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,799
I missed you

1620
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,439
Are you going to stay here?

1621
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,192
Yes. Until the end.

1622
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,432
Agustina is very very ill.

1623
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,751
After what I did to her mother,

1624
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,354
it's the least I could do for her
until she dies, don't you think?

1625
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,830
Yes. Mom, I've so many things to tell you...

1626
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,309
I haven't told you about Paco
or what I've done.

1627
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,597
I can't wait for you to tell me,
but you have to leave now.

1628
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,991
We'll see each other every day.
Between us we'll manage.

1629
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,349
Yes.

1630
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,552
I need you, Mom.

1631
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:36,118
I don't know how I could have lived
all these years without you.

1632
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,272
Don't say that, Raimunda,

1633
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,313
or I'll start crying

1634
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,275
and ghosts don't cry.
