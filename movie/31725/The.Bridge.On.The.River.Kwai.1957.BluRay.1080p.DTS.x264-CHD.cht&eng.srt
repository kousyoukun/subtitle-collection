1
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,936
快點幹完活！
Finish work!

2
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,396
到棚屋去
Go to hut.

3
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,148
是啊 要不讓新來的俘虜
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,152
看到我們在挖墳墓 他們會要逃跑的
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.

5
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,447
沒時間說笑了 快點幹！
No time for jokes. Finish work!

6
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,657
挖 挖
Dig, dig.

7
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,452
把我們算作病號 怎麼樣？
How about putting us on sick list?

8
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,789
發發慈悲吧 上尉 把我們放到醫院塈a
Have a heart, captain. Put us in hospital.

9
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,334
你現在沒有病 你從來沒有病
You no sick. You never sick.

10
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,045
你為什麼一直要裝病 捨爾斯？
Why you always play sick, Shears?

11
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,173
我猜我不想放個這玩意兒在我頭頂上
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.

12
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,717
金松上尉…
Captain Kanematsu...

13
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,637
…煙屁股怎麼樣？
...how about a butt?

14
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,556
我今早才給你的 給你們倆
I give you butt this morning. Both of you.

15
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,018
是的 我不是那意思 我想回報一下
That's what I mean. I want to return the favour.

16
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,021
當一個好心人給我禮物…
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart...

17
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,150
…就像你給我那煙屁股 我會牢記在心的
...like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.

18
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,278
這就是為什麼…
That's why...

19
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,406
…我想給你這打火機
...l want you to keep this lighter.

20
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,246
以為是我偷的？
Think I stole it?

21
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,165
這是我們剛剛埋的那個英國小伙子的
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.

22
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,126
是他感激我而送給我的
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.

23
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,338
在我死前 我想把它送給你
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.

24
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
你這個人真有趣 捨爾斯
You funny man, Shears.

25
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,972
你現在是病號了 他也是
You go on sick list. Him too.

26
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,977
總有一天 Saito 上校會發現你在賄賂他…
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him...

27
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,854
…那時我們會怎麼樣？
...then where'll we be?

28
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,859
在那之前 我們早就離開這堣F 夥計
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.

29
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,152
逃得遠遠的
Far away.

30
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,864
好吧 我們收工吧
Okay, let's knock off.

31
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,617
這婼鷁菕K
Here lies....

32
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,204
我忘掉了我們剛才埋的是誰
I forgot who we just buried.

33
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,706
湯姆森
Thomson.

34
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,291
啊 對
Ah, yes.

35
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,501
這婼鷁蛬息B特 湯姆森下士…
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

36
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,547
…編號是:01234567
...serial number zero- one- two-  three- four- five- six- seven.

37
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,760
國王或女王或著什麼的勇敢的戰士…
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something...

38
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,557
…在我主紀元1943 死於腳氣病…
...who died of beri- beri in the year of our Lord, 1 943...

39
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,268
…為了光榮偉大的…
...for the greater glory of....

40
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,646
- 他是為了什麼死的？ - 算了
- What did he die for? - Come off it.

41
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,107
不要嘲笑死人
No need to mock the grave.

42
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,444
我沒有嘲笑死人
I don't mock the grave or the man.

43
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,572
希望他能在和平中安息
May he rest in peace.

44
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,119
雖然在他活著的時候沒有找到和平
He found little of it while he was alive.

45
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,363
A 隊 原地踏步走！
"A" Company, mark time!

46
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,213
原地踏步走！
Mark time!

47
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,622
立定
Halt.

48
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,836
排成一行 向左轉
Into line, left turn.

49
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,091
稍息
Stand easy.

50
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,309
我們又要挖很多墓 維佛
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.

51
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,812
幹的好 幹的好
Well done, well done.

52
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,949
那個上校還不知道他將會遭遇到什麼
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.

53
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,201
你準備去告訴他真相？
You going to tell him the truth?

54
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,702
當然不
Of course not.

55
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,746
你既不是軍官也不是個紳士
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.

56
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,906
我叫 尼科爾森
My name is Nicholson.

57
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,118
我是Saito 上校
I am Colonel Saito.

58
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:58,801
我以天皇的名義…
In the name of His lmperial Majesty...

59
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,887
…歡迎你們
...l welcome you.

60
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,057
我是這個戰俘營的指揮官…
I am the commanding officer of this camp...

61
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,311
…這堿O沿著這條大鐵路…
...which is Camp 1 6...

62
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,897
…的第16戰俘營…
...along the great railroad...

63
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:16,319
…這條鐵路很快就將曼谷和仰光連接起來
...which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.

64
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,782
你們這些英軍俘虜…
You British prisoners have been chosen...

65
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,202
…將要去修建一座跨越桂河的大橋
...to build a bridge across the River Kwai.

66
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:30,416
這將是一個愉快的工作 但需要技能
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.

67
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,504
軍官也要和士兵一起工作
And officers will work as well as men.

68
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:41,093
我們小日本軍隊不會養吃白飯的懶人
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.

69
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:46,307
如果你努力工作 就會得到優待
If you work hard, you will be treated well.

70
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,102
但是如果你不努力工作…
But if you do not work hard...

71
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,897
…你將受到懲罰
...you will be punished.

72
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,818
關於逃跑 我要說幾句
A word to you about escape.

73
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,155
這堥S有鐵絲網
There is no barbed wire.

74
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,449
沒有圍欄
No stockade.

75
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,451
也沒有瞭望哨
No watchtower.

76
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,121
這些都不需要
They are not necessary.

77
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,999
我們處於熱帶雨林中一個孤島
We are an island in the jungle.

78
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,211
逃出去是不可能的
Escape is impossible.

79
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,255
會死在雨林中的
You would die.

80
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,886
今天休息 明天開始幹活
Today you rest. Tomorrow you'll begin.

81
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,226
最後讓我告訴你們山下將軍的格言:
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:

82
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,269
"在工作中尋求快樂"
" Be happy in your work."

83
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,939
在工作中尋求快樂
Be happy in your work.

84
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,943
解散
Dismissed.

85
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,159
全體 稍息
Battalion, stand at ease.

86
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,828
出隊 休斯上校
Fall out, Major Hughes.

87
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,205
全體 稍息
Battalion, stand easy.

88
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,542
休斯 把他們帶到崗位上去 看看誰生病了
Hughes, get the men to their quarters. See who's sick.

89
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,128
我要和這傢伙說句話
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.

90
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,386
我剛才聽了你的訓話 先生
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

91
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,348
我的部下會堅持英國士兵的一貫方式
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.

92
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,935
我的軍官和我會對他們的行為負責
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.

93
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:17,273
你可能沒注意到讓軍官去勞動…
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour...

94
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,942
…在日內瓦公約中是不允許的
...is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.

95
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,402
是那樣的嗎？
Is that so?

96
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,320
我有一份公約的複印件…
I have a copy of the convention...

97
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,532
…我很樂意讓你看一下
...and would be glad to let you glance through it.

98
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,160
不用了
That will not be necessary.

99
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,456
請坐
Sit down, please.

100
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,507
是 長官
Yes, sir.

101
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,928
我要和科林普頓說句話
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.

102
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,515
科林普頓 不要讓別人打擾我
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

103
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,558
- 胳膊怎麼樣了？ - 快好了
- How's the arm? - Nearly healed.

104
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,270
先生 這是美國海軍的捨爾斯司令官
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.

105
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
你好 先生
How do you do, sir?

106
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,649
我們發現他和一個澳大利亞人
We found him and an Australian.

107
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,943
是修建這個營地的僅存俘虜
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.

108
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,861
美國海軍？ 大老遠的跑到這堙H
U.S. Navy? Out here?

109
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,114
我們差不多被陸地包圍了
I am sort of landlocked.

110
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,533
- 然後你丟棄了你的船？ - 休斯頓號
- You lost your ship? - The Houston.

111
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,203
我讓它擱淺 但是我和其他的倖存者失散了
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.

112
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,871
這兒原來和你在一起的人呢？
And your group here?

113
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,332
多數是澳洲人 一些…
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

114
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,835
英國人還有印度人 緬甸人 暹羅人
Some British. Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

115
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,712
他們怎麼了？
And what happened to them?

116
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
他們都死於…
They died...

117
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,802
…瘧疾 痢疾 腳氣和壞疽
...of malaria, dysentery, beri- beri, gangrene.

118
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,303
其他的死因是:
Other causes of death:

119
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,641
飢餓 勞累過度 槍傷 蛇咬…
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites...

120
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,601
…還有 Saito
...Saito.

121
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,147
然後還有一些不想過了
Then there were some who just got tired of living.

122
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,648
科林普頓給你檢查過了嗎？
Has Clipton seen you?

123
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,026
正好就要看了 過來 你可以待會刮臉
Just about to. Come over here, you can shave later.

124
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,446
好的
All right.

125
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,950
你可以和軍官待在一起
You'll stay with the officers.

126
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,869
我們會給你找一些像樣的衣服
We'll find some decent clothing.

127
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,537
不要為我操心了
Don't bother about me.

128
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,998
我還不想急著離開病號房
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.

129
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,084
另外 這是勞動工具 這兒流行這個
Besides, this is working kit. It's the fashion here.

130
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,462
你們當時連軍官都干體力勞動嗎？
The officers in your party did manual labour?

131
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,380
我想是的
I think you could call it that.

132
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,842
我可以列舉出那個上校讓我們做的每一點 他叫什麼來著
I raised that very point with Colonel what's- his- name.

133
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,302
齋藤
Saito.

134
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,430
- 我認為他現在明白那樣做是不對的了 - 是嗎？
- I think he understands now. - Is that so?

135
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,975
是的 我必須說明 他看起來好像是那種很通情達理的類型
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.

136
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,102
是這樣啊 那我可得抓緊了
Well, I must be pushing on.

137
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,146
7點鐘有個軍官會議
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

138
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,274
- 把你的要求列個單子 - 是 長官
- Give me a list of your requirements. - Yes, sir.

139
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,276
我們會盡量滿足
Anything we can do.

140
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,195
謝謝 長官
Thank you, sir.

141
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
- 這是為什麼？ - 別介意
- What is it? - Never mind.

142
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,493
說說看
Go on, say it.

143
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,871
我可以想像出很多稱呼Saito的詞
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito...

144
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,583
…"通情達理" 倒是第一次聽說
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

145
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,920
或許尼科爾森上校對這個詞有不同的定義
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.

146
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,180
有其他補充的嗎？
Any other points?

147
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
- 可以允許我說嗎 長官？ - 詹寧斯？
- By your leave, sir? - Jennings?

148
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,185
有關逃跑委員會 我已經和捨爾斯司令官討論過了…
About the escape committee. I've spoken with Cmd. Shears...

149
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,270
不會再有什麼逃跑委員會了
There won't be any escape committee.

150
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,065
我不明白 長官 詹寧斯少尉有個計劃
I don't understand, sir. Lt. Jennings has a plan.

151
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,109
是的 是的 我相信詹寧斯有個計劃 但是 逃到哪堙H
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?

152
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,781
逃進雨林？ 那個Saito傢伙說的是對的
Where? lnto this jungle? That fellow, Saito, is right.

153
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:40,035
這堿O不需要鐵絲網 逃進雨林只有1/100的生存可能
No need for barbed wire here. One chance in 1 00 of survival.

154
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,414
我認為象捨爾斯司令官 那樣有經驗的人會支持我的計劃
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.

155
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,418
我說過了逃跑成功的可能性是1/100
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.

156
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,462
我可以插個嘴嗎？
But may I add another word?

157
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,964
請
Please.

158
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,342
在這個戰俘營的生存概率還要小
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.

159
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,595
你已經看到了那些墳墓 他們是你在這堨穻s的真實幾率
You've seen the graveyard. They're your real odds.

160
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,055
放棄逃走的希望…
To give up hope of escape...

161
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,642
…甚至不去考慮逃走 意味著接受死亡宣判
...to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.

162
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,561
為什麼到目前你還沒有試著逃跑呢 司令官先生？
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?

163
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,691
我在等候良機 等待正確的時間 和正確的夥伴
I'm biding my time. Waiting for the right moment, the right company.

164
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,985
我知道你的感受
I understand how you feel.

165
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,115
當然 作為一個被俘士兵 逃跑是他的天職
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.

166
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,243
但是我和我的部下正處在一個奇怪的境地…
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point...

167
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,662
而你並不知道這個
...of which you are unaware.

168
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,582
在新加坡 是指揮部命令我們投降的
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.

169
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,501
請注意 是命令
Ordered, mind you.

170
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:34,256
所以 在我們這種情況下 逃跑就會違反戰爭法
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.

171
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,757
這真有意思 長官
Interesting point, sir.

172
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,552
對不起 長官 我不能同意你的觀點
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.

173
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,389
你想不惜一切代價去遵守法律條文？
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?

174
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,308
沒有了法律 指揮官先生 就不會有文明的存在
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.

175
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,937
這正是我的觀點 在這 沒有文明
That's just my point. Here, there is no civilization.

176
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,982
那麼 我們正好有機會在這堣瑗i文明
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.

177
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,318
我建議否決逃跑的議題
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.

178
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,072
還有什麼要說的嗎？
Is there anything else?

179
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,869
我想我們都清楚了
I think we're clear on the program.

180
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,748
我想從明天開始所有的事情都能順利展開
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.

181
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,541
並且 請各位記住:
And remember this:

182
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,836
必須要讓我們的人感覺是我們在指揮他們…
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us...

183
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,046
…而不是小日本
...and not by the Japanese.

184
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,551
這樣 他們就會還是士兵 而不是奴隸
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

185
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,887
同意我的觀點嗎 指揮官先生？
Are you with me there, commander?

186
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,519
我希望他們還能是士兵 上校
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.

187
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,897
可我只是個奴隸
As for me, I'm just a slave.

188
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,232
一個還活著的奴隸
A living slave.

189
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,748
即使在美國人來說 他也是個古怪的傢伙…
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

190
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,001
被囚禁得太久了 可憐的傢伙
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.

191
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:57,339
這就是脫離自己人的結果 對我們也是個教訓
Cut off from his unit. It should be a lesson to all of us.

192
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,773
英軍俘虜們！
English prisoners!

193
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:20,612
請注意我不是說"英軍士兵"
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

194
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:26,701
當你們投降的那一刻起 你們就不是士兵了
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.

195
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:32,707
你們要在五月12號前完成大橋
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.

196
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,213
你們會在小日本工程師的指導下工作
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.

197
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,679
時間很短 所有人都得工作
Time is short. All men will work.

198
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
你們的軍官會和你們一起工作
Your officers will work beside you.

199
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,976
投降就是你們的軍官對你們的背叛
This is only just...

200
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,230
這就是對他們背叛你們的處罰
...for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.

201
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:58,024
羞辱你們就是要讓羞辱他們
Your shame is their dishonour.

202
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,777
是他們告訴你們…
It is they who told you...

203
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:05,615
…好死不如賴活著
...better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.

204
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,119
是他們讓你們來這堛 不是我
It is they who brought you here, not l.

205
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:14,833
所以 他們也要和你們一起干體力活
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.

206
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,127
完畢
That is all.

207
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,423
軍官俘虜們 拿好你們的工具
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

208
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,217
布拉德利 歸隊
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,184
我必須讓你注意 Saito上校…
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito...

210
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,104
…在日內瓦公約的27條
...to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:39,482
" 交戰國可以僱用戰俘去做他們合適做的工作…
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war...

212
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,776
…指揮官除外… "
...who are fit, other than officers..."

213
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,278
把書給我
Give me the book.

214
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,072
當然你能讀懂英文嗎？我有點懷疑
By all means. You read English, I take it?

215
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,450
- 你能讀懂日文嗎？ - 很遺憾 不會
- Do you read Japanese? - I'm sorry, no.

216
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,953
如果需要翻譯 我想我可以安排
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.

217
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,164
你看 規則(Code)指出…
You see, the Code states that...

218
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,418
站著別動
Stand fast in the ranks.

219
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,504
你和我說"規則"？
You speak to me of Code?

220
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,257
你說的是什麼"規則"？
What " Code"?

221
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,676
你說的是懦夫的"規則"！
The coward's code!

222
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,430
你知道什麼是士兵的規則？
What do you know of the soldier's code?

223
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,850
你知道什麼是武士道的規則？ 你什麼都不知道！
Of bushido? Nothing!

224
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,561
你不配當指揮官！
You are unworthy of command!

225
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:32,535
如果你拒絕遵守文明世界的法規…
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world...

226
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,414
…那我們要考慮是否有義務去聽從你的命令
...we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.

227
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:39,918
我的軍官不會去做體力勞動
My officers will not do manual labour.

228
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:41,878
我們走著瞧
We shall see.

229
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,885
所有戰俘開始去工作
All enlisted prisoners to work.

230
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,649
軍士長！ 帶他們去工作
Sergeant Major! Take the men to work.

231
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,611
全體注意 拿起工具
Battalion, take up tools.

232
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:13,701
向左靠齊 向左轉！
Move to the left in columnar route. Left turn!

233
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:18,706
"A" 隊 齊步走
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.

234
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,377
向右看
Eyes right.

235
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,380
向右看
Eyes right.

236
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,973
向前看
Eyes front.

237
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:47,068
齊步走 向右看
Quick march, eyes right.

238
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,040
" C" 隊
" C" Company, by the right.

239
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,084
他在等什麼？
What's he up to?

240
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,548
好像他不想有人看到
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.

241
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,442
現在 你是否會明白一些
Now, you will be reasonable.

242
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,903
命令你的指揮官去開始工作
You will order your officers to work.

243
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,405
不
No.

244
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,688
我數三下
I will count three.

245
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,899
如果數到第三下…
If by the third count...

246
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,570
…你和你的指揮官還沒有去工作的話…
...you and your officers are not on the way to work...

247
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,490
…我就下令開槍
...l will give the order to fire.

248
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,168
他會這樣做的
He's going to do it.

249
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,213
相信我 他確實想殺了他們
Believe me, he's really going to do it.

250
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:41,808
一
One.

251
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,601
我警告你 上校…
I warn you, Colonel....

252
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,311
二
Two.

253
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:49,732
等一等！
Stop!

254
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,615
Saito上校 我耳聞目睹了一切
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.

255
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,742
醫院堛漱H也這樣
So has every man in the hospital.

256
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,369
有太多的證人
They're too many witnesses.

257
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,623
你不能謊稱這是集體逃跑 那些人很多連路都不能走
You can't call it a mass escape. Most of those men can't walk.

258
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,963
這就是你的士兵規則？ 屠殺手無寸鐵的人？
Is this your soldier's code? Murdering unarmed men?

259
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,122
詹寧斯 你看 當個病號多好
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.

260
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,292
我認為那老傢伙勇氣十足
I'll say this for the old man. He's got guts.

261
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,794
這樣會死得更快
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."

262
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,421
怎麼會那樣 長官？
How's that, sir?

263
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,631
那種愚蠢的勇氣
That kind of guts.

264
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,633
就像他們在1914一樣…
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4...

265
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,553
…那時 軍官們用枴杖來反抗
...when officers fought with only a swagger stick.

266
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:46,057
- 我明白你的意思 - 你一點也不明白我的意思
- I see what you mean. - You don't see what I mean at all.

267
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,185
那種勇氣會讓我們全部送命的
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.

268
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:33,604
對不起 長官 我也要和你一起逃跑
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.

269
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,775
我的胳膊差不多好了 長官 情況確實像你說的那樣
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.

270
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,069
那他會同意嗎？
What about him?

271
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,739
他並沒有命令我們不准逃跑 他只是建議我們不逃跑
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.

272
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:48,828
聽著 像你們上校那樣人的建議就是命令
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.

273
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,497
又開始了
Here we go again.

274
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,094
Saito上校命令所有軍官去懲戒室
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.

275
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:07,179
告訴他們去懲戒室
Tell them to go.

276
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,897
你留下
Not you.

277
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,079
過來
Come.

278
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,893
放了他！
Leave him alone!

279
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,397
放了他！
Leave him alone!

280
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,327
他們要把他關進悶室
They're going to put him in the oven.

281
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:19,395
# For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

282
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:24,149
# For he's a jolly good fellow

283
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:26,652
# And so say all of us

284
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,698
# And so say all of us And so say all of us

285
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:37,037
# For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

286
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,707
# For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,335
# And so say all of us

288
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,799
倒啦！
Timber!

289
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:01,973
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

290
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,229
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

291
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:11,858
不行！
No, no, no!

292
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:13,819
鬆開！
Let go!

293
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:16,696
鬆開！
Let go!

294
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,413
你想來見我？
You wish to see me?

295
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:08,874
3天來 我一直想見你
I've tried to see you for three days.

296
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:12,210
上校已經被關在悶室堙K
It's about the colonel. He's been shut up in that hut...

297
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,382
我應該槍斃你
I could have you shot.

298
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:22,262
那些想逃跑的俘虜是你的手下
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.

299
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:24,347
對逃跑我毫不知情
I knew nothing about the escape.

300
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,184
那無關緊要
It does not matter.

301
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:30,312
那些逃跑的人值得尊敬
One must respect those who tried.

302
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:34,316
在逃亡和死亡的一瞬間…
For a brief moment, between escape and death...

303
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,276
他們又成了戰士
...they were soldiers again.

304
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,406
但是試圖從這堸k出去是愚蠢的
But it is insane to try and escape.

305
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:45,952
兩個被槍打死 第三個被淹死
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.

306
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,662
到頭來又有什麼好結果呢？
To what end?

307
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,749
只不過是逃避現實罷了
It was an escape from reality.

308
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,759
這是你的現實
There is your reality.

309
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:05,764
按計劃 你們今天中午應該修到這堣F
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.

310
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,851
而實際上只到這
And this shows the position of actual progress.

311
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,733
由於你們上校的愚頑不化 我們的進度遠遠落後了
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.

312
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:17,984
還不止這些
That is not all.

313
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:21,571
戰俘還蓄意破壞
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.

314
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,742
是的 我看到的 我早就應該槍斃他們
Yes, I have seen it. I could have them all shot.

315
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,620
然後 誰替你造橋呢？
Then who would build your bridge?

316
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,830
另外 你認為那真的是蓄意破壞嗎？
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

317
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,125
沒有了自己的指揮官 他們的工作肯定不會做得太好
The men don't work well without their own officers.

318
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:39,172
我的指揮官會直接領導他們工作 你們的指揮官要和他們一塊工作
My officers will direct them. Your officers will work beside them.

319
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,299
那要由尼科爾森來決定
That's for Nicholson to decide.

320
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:43,301
而且就像他說的那樣 這樣做是違背條約的
As he said, it's against the rules.

321
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,637
別和我談什麼條約
Do not speak to me of rules.

322
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:47,681
這是戰爭！
This is war!

323
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,974
並不是什麼公平的遊戲
This is not a game of cricket.

324
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,648
你的上校是個瘋子
He's mad, your colonel...

325
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,984
完全是瘋了
...quite mad.

326
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:03,947
請坐
Sit down, please.

327
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:13,415
我決定了 只讓你一個人去看你們的上校
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.

328
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,125
謝謝
Thank you.

329
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:19,838
告訴他 如果他的指揮官還不參加勞動的話…
Tell him that if his officers will not work...

330
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:23,049
我將不得不關閉醫院…
...l'll be forced to close the hospital...

331
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,678
然後你的病人將替他們勞動
...and your patients will work in their place.

332
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:31,266
會死掉一些人 這全都要怪他
Many will die, and he will be responsible.

333
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:35,979
去和他講你只有5分鐘時間
Go and speak to him. You have five minutes.

334
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:07,635
醫生要去看那老夥計了
Doc's going to see the old man.

335
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,765
長官…
Sir....

336
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,605
是科林普頓 長官
It's Clipton, sir.

337
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:22,567
我給你帶來些東西
I brought you a few things.

338
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:30,450
- 我的部下怎麼樣了？ - 他們還好 長官
- How are the men? - Fine, sir, fine.

339
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,871
我們給您湊了點肉和一個椰子
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.

340
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,542
軍官們怎麼樣？
And the officers?

341
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:42,420
不太好 他們還在關禁閉
Not so good. They're still in detention.

342
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,966
詹寧斯上尉死了
And Lieutenant Jennings.... Jennings is dead.

343
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,719
- 什麼？ - 在逃跑的時候被槍打死了
- What? - Killed, attempting to escape.

344
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:53,431
還有維佛下士和那個美國人
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.

345
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:58,144
詹寧斯 真可憐 勇敢的小伙子
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

346
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,563
我警告過他 對不對？
I warned him, didn't l, Clipton?

347
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:03,650
長官 我們時間不多了
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

348
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,448
我一邊給你清理 一邊說
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.

349
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:12,825
我有些事情要告訴你
I've got something to tell you.

350
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,536
我和Saito吵過了
I've just had a word with Saito.

351
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,457
那個傢伙是我遇過的最差的指揮官
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.

352
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,752
他是個瘋子 你說
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

353
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,229
訛詐！
Blackmail!

354
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:46,109
我知道 長官 但他是認真的
I know, sir, but he means it. I'm sure he does.

355
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,988
很簡單 這是個關於面子的問題 但他是不會屈服的
It's a question of face, pure and simple. And he can't give in.

356
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:52,573
但那仍然是訛詐
It's still blackmail.

357
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:59,330
長官 你是撐不過他的
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.

358
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:04,752
我們那些軍官被憋在那個悶室堣]不是辦法
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?

359
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:10,007
我們的士兵在盡量地拖延工期
The men are doing a wonderful job. They're going as slow as they dare.

360
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,302
但是Saito在削減他們的食物配額…
But Saito's cut their food rations...

361
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:15,638
並且一旦他讓病人去工作…
...and if he makes the sick men work....

362
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:19,684
很顯然就會死很多人
Well, they're going to die. That's all there is to it.

363
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:22,729
是的 科林普頓 我很清楚
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

364
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,523
但是你看到了嗎？這關乎原則
But don't you see? It's a matter of principle.

365
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:29,569
如果我們現在屈服了 就會無休無止 不行
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it. No.

366
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:37,076
長官 我們陷在雨林 遠離文明
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.

367
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:41,998
我們是在一個為了達到自己目的可以不擇手段的傢伙的統治下 更別說原則了！
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way. Principle!

368
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:46,377
沒有人會知道這兒發生了什麼 也不會有人關心
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.

369
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,130
退一步吧 長官 求求你了！
Give in, sir. Please!

370
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:50,840
我不會動搖的
I'm adamant.

371
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,802
我不會讓我的軍官去象一個小工一樣干苦力
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.

372
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:56,721
- 時間到 - 好的
- Time. - All right.

373
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:02,518
謝謝關心我的人
Please thank those concerned.

374
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:05,646
醫院堛漕C個人都獻了一片肉
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.

375
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:07,523
雷諾茲偷了個椰子
Reynolds stole the coconut.

376
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:11,903
我們還會給你帶來食物的
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.

377
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:14,614
我們已經賄賂了一個看管你的守衛
We've bribed one of your guards.

378
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:24,499
再見 長官 祝好運
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

379
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:26,626
多謝
Many thanks.

380
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:36,636
你說那個美國人被打死了？
Did you say that American was killed?

381
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:39,013
是的 長官 被槍打倒後淹死了
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

382
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:43,601
計劃逃跑真是個愚蠢的念頭
It's insane to plan escapes.

383
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,688
3人被殺 結果怎麼樣呢？
Three men killed, and to what end?

384
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:49,190
時間到！
Time!

385
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:52,485
我們在這堣@定能勝利
Here is where we must win through.

386
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:16,759
醫生看著我們並搖搖頭 什麼意思
Doc just looked at us and shook his head. Whatever that means.

387
00:43:16,968 --> 00:43:20,554
只有一個意思 上校不會屈服
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.

388
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:34,652
怎麼樣？
Well?

389
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,570
是這樣的
It's like this.

390
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:39,490
尼科爾森上校不準備向武力屈服
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.

391
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,867
這是個原則的問題
It's a question of principle.

392
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,579
作為醫療官 我抗議對他的折磨
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.

393
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,790
他還能活著 真是奇跡
It's a wonder he's still alive.

394
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:52,003
如果發生悲劇 那和謀殺是一樣的
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.

395
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,340
要怪就怪他
He is responsible.

396
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,051
不是我
Not l.

397
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,938
你病了？
You sick?

398
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:16,777
他們都瘋了嗎？
Are they both mad?

399
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,322
或者我也要發瘋了？
Or am I going mad?

400
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:23,701
太陽也瘋了？
Or is it the sun?

401
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,801
立正！
Attention!

402
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,764
全體立正
Battalion, attention.

403
00:47:34,558 --> 00:47:36,769
英軍俘虜們
English prisoners.

404
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,480
讓我們問一個問題…
Let us ask the question...

405
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,900
…為什麼大橋進展遲緩？
...why does the bridge not progress?

406
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:48,572
你們知道為什麼 因為你們的指揮官是懶惰的！
You know why, because your officers are lazy!

407
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:53,243
他們認為自己高人一等 而不願和你們分擔
They think themselves too good to share your burden.

408
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:55,788
這是不公平的
This is not just.

409
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:59,208
所以 你們工作起來也不愉快
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.

410
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:03,420
所以 大橋也沒有什麼進展
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.

411
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:06,215
但是還有一個原因
But there is another cause.

412
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:09,510
我不避諱事實
I do not hide the truth.

413
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:12,638
我很慚愧…
With deep shame and regret...

414
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:15,182
…我承認也是由於我們的一個小日本狗屎
...l admit to you the failure...

415
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:18,268
…的無能
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

416
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:20,729
我是指 Miura上尉
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

417
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,398
他是一個很差的工程師
He is a bad engineer.

418
00:48:23,649 --> 00:48:25,901
他的指揮毫不稱職
He is unworthy of command.

419
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,864
所以 我把他撤換了
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.

420
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:36,620
明天 我們重新開始
Tomorrow we begin again.

421
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,374
我會親自指揮
I shall be in personal command.

422
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,960
今天 我們休息
Today we rest.

423
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,550
只有工作而沒有娛樂會很不爽的！
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!

424
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,512
為了你們明天努力工作…
As token of regard for your efforts in the future...

425
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:56,306
…我給你們每個人一份禮物
...l give presents to you all.

426
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:11,029
工作愉快
Let us be happy in our work.

427
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:14,700
解散
Company, dismissed.

428
00:49:16,076 --> 00:49:19,580
全體解散
Battalion, dismissed.

429
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:36,388
嘿 看看
Hey, take a look at this.

430
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:39,308
紅十字！ 他把我們的…
Red Cross! He's given us our...

431
00:49:39,558 --> 00:49:42,519
嘿 他把我方的紅十字包裹發給我們
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.

432
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:46,064
"明天重新開始"
"Tomorrow we begin again."

433
00:50:51,129 --> 00:50:52,547
嘿 哈里 看！
Hey, Harry, look!

434
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:55,592
他們要把老夥計放出來了
They're letting the old man out.

435
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:21,159
看來 他們要再毒打他一頓
Most likely going to give him another pasting.

436
00:52:05,453 --> 00:52:06,955
晚上好 上校
Good evening, colonel.

437
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,006
願意過來坐一坐嗎？
Do you mind sitting over here?

438
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,759
我晚飯還沒有吃
I am having rather a late supper.

439
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:45,201
英國咸牛肉
English corned beef.

440
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:47,704
不用 謝謝
No, thank you.

441
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:55,545
產自蘇格蘭
Produce of Scotland.

442
00:52:57,255 --> 00:52:59,507
我寧願它是日本米酒
I prefer it to sake.

443
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,677
我在倫敦呆了3年
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.

444
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:06,598
我在倫敦工藝學校學習
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

445
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:09,559
敬你！
Cheers!

446
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:11,394
抱歉
Sorry.

447
00:53:11,644 --> 00:53:13,480
下次？
Later, perhaps?

448
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,357
也許
Perhaps.

449
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:23,281
我不是一個好的藝術家
I was not a good artist.

450
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,825
我爸爸不贊成我搞藝術
My father disapproved.

451
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:28,495
他覺得我應該在軍隊發展
He felt I belonged in the army.

452
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:33,291
所以我放棄了藝術 改學工程
So I changed from art to engineering.

453
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,088
我必須告訴你 Saito上校
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

454
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:42,092
我要將你的行為寫一份完整的報告
I intend to make a full report of your activities.

455
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:51,226
我不認為你理解我的處境
I do not think you quite realize my position.

456
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:55,021
- 我必須執行給我的命令 - 噢 當然
- I must carry out my orders. - Oh, quite, quite.

457
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:59,192
我必須在5月12號之前完成大橋
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.

458
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:02,112
- 我只有12個星期多一點 - 是的
- I have only 1 2 weeks more. - No doubt.

459
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:07,117
所以 我必須啟用我手上的任何一個人
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.

460
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:10,203
軍官不行 除非是管理工作
No officers, except for administration.

461
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:14,582
但是在這條鐵路線上 所有的軍官都在工作
But officers are working along the entire railway.

462
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,459
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it. I know it.

463
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:19,587
其他地方的軍官我不管
I'm not responsible for other officers.

464
00:54:19,796 --> 00:54:21,297
從我個人來講 我很震驚
Personally, I'm appalled.

465
00:54:21,506 --> 00:54:23,925
別激動
Let's not get excited.

466
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,057
來枝雪茄嗎？
Will you have a cigar?

467
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:33,268
不 謝謝
No. Thank you.

468
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:38,773
當我說所有的指揮官都要勞動的時候…
When I said all officers must work...

469
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:42,443
…事實上是指少尉至上校階級之各指揮官 並沒有包括你
...naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.

470
00:54:42,694 --> 00:54:46,906
我的命令只適用於下級軍官…
My orders were only intended for officers below...

471
00:54:47,115 --> 00:54:49,200
任何軍官都不能做苦力勞動
No officers will do manual labour.

472
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,745
拜託！ 我是要說:
Please! I was about to say:

473
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:56,291
我通盤考慮過了
I've thought the matter over and have decided...

474
00:54:56,541 --> 00:55:01,004
…我要讓他們大部分做管理工作
...to put majors and above on administrative duties...

475
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:04,007
…只有很低級的軍官去勞動
...leaving only junior officers to work.

476
00:55:04,215 --> 00:55:07,802
不行 公約關於這個的規定很清楚
No. The Convention's quite clear on that point.

477
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:26,154
你知道如果大橋不能準時建成 我會怎樣？
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?

478
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:28,031
一點也不知道
I haven't the foggiest.

479
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,908
我必須自殺
I'd have to kill myself.

480
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:34,037
如果你是我 你會怎樣？
What would you do if you were me?

481
00:55:34,537 --> 00:55:37,165
如果我是你…
I suppose if I were you...

482
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:40,084
…我想我會自殺
...l'd have to kill myself.

483
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:43,504
敬你
Cheers.

484
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:47,300
我警告你 上校…
I warn you, colonel...

485
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,013
…在我死之前 其他的人都得死
...if I am to die, others will die before me.

486
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:53,514
你明白了嗎？
Do you understand?

487
00:55:53,765 --> 00:55:56,392
科林普頓並沒有這麼說
Clipton did mention that.

488
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,103
但那樣也不能解決你的問題
That won't solve your problem.

489
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:01,773
我想我們可以達成一個解決辦法
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.

490
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:03,650
請坐
Please sit down.

491
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:10,323
請你告訴我 上校…
Now. Tell me, colonel...

492
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:14,327
你認為軍人的天職是服從命令嗎？
...do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?

493
00:56:14,577 --> 00:56:16,454
- 當然 - 好的
- Of course. - Good.

494
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,208
現在
Now.

495
00:56:22,794 --> 00:56:24,712
我們來看看你的大橋
Take this bridge of yours.

496
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:27,632
真是一個巨大的工程
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

497
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,011
坦率地說 我懷疑你的那個叫什麼來著的上尉…
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's- his- name...

498
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:34,097
三浦
Miura.

499
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:38,893
能勝任這樣的工作
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.

500
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:44,524
另外 我有些軍官 比如堣狻M休斯…
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance...

501
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:48,486
…他們在印度到處修橋
...who have built bridges all over lndia.

502
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:51,197
人們都尊敬他們
The men respect them.

503
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:55,118
尊重對一個軍官來說是很重要的
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.

504
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,495
如果沒有尊重 則不能服眾
If it's gone, he ceases to command.

505
00:56:57,745 --> 00:57:00,164
然後會怎麼樣？ 部下漫無紀律 指揮混亂
What then? Demoralization and chaos.

506
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:03,918
如果讓這種情況發生 那麼我就是個非常不稱職的指揮官
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.

507
00:57:04,168 --> 00:57:09,298
也許你忘記了 修建大橋是由我來指揮的
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.

508
00:57:09,632 --> 00:57:13,302
真的嗎？ 你對進度滿意嗎？
Really? And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?

509
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:15,847
- 很不滿意！ - 你證明了我的觀點
- I am not! - You've proved my point.

510
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:18,307
我痛恨英國人！
I hate the British!

511
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:21,686
你們被打敗了 還不知羞恥
You are defeated but you have no shame.

512
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:24,355
你們很頑固 但沒有什麼值得自豪的
You are stubborn but have no pride.

513
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:27,608
你們會忍耐 但你們沒有勇氣
You endure but you have no courage.

514
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,610
我痛恨英國人！
I hate the British!

515
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:32,613
這樣不能解決任何問題
Pointless, going on like this.

516
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:34,115
站著！
Stay there!

517
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:13,334
暫停！
Stand down. Stand down!

518
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:25,346
全體立正！
Battalion, attention!

519
01:02:05,344 --> 01:02:08,097
全體 稍息
Battalion, stand at ease.

520
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:12,142
請…
Please....

521
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:16,313
你知道今天是什麼日子嗎 上校？
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?

522
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:18,273
我已經不會記數了
I've lost count.

523
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:21,318
這是我們1905年
It's the anniversary of our great victory...

524
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,279
大勝俄國人的紀念日…
...over Russia in 1 905.

525
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:28,659
整個東亞都在慶祝這個日子
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.

526
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:30,744
趁著這個偉大的日子…
In honour of this occasion...

527
01:02:30,994 --> 01:02:33,706
…我給你的部下放了一天假
...l have given your troops a day of rest.

528
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:35,207
多謝
Many thanks.

529
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:38,460
我要宣佈一個特赦
I am declaring a general amnesty.

530
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:42,214
你和你的軍官可以回到你們的住處
You and your officers may return to your quarters.

531
01:02:42,464 --> 01:02:44,717
作為這個特赦的一部分…
As part of this amnesty...

532
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:50,222
…軍官不需要做體力勞動了
...it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.

533
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,712
他做到了！
He's done it!

534
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,982
應該給某些人發勳章
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

535
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,579
你的手下有多少人？
How many men in your party?

536
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,789
我不是很清楚 長官
I don't really know, sir.

537
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,167
- 你不清楚？ - 通常有12個人
- You don't know? - Twelve, usually.

538
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,712
今早有一個生病了 長官
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.

539
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,299
有三四個人把他抬到醫院去了
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.

540
01:06:14,176 --> 01:06:17,637
嗯 他病得很厲害 長官
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

541
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:21,600
一個下士必須清楚他管轄多少人
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.

542
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,102
是 長官
Oh, yes, sir.

543
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,690
你的面部神經有問題嗎？ 否則 不要那樣做鬼臉
Have you a nervous affliction? Stop making those faces.

544
01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:34,571
也許你認為很有趣 但不要那樣做鬼臉
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.

545
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:35,989
沒有問題 長官
No, sir.

546
01:06:39,784 --> 01:06:42,454
我們必須停止這些作假行為
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.

547
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:54,758
- 我說 堣牷H - 什麼 長官？
- I say, Reeves? - Yes, sir?

548
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:58,512
以前在這類河上修建過大橋嗎？
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?

549
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,307
是的 長官 我們在馬德拉斯和孟加拉修的橋有半數是這類的
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....

550
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:04,559
如果這是你負責修建的大橋…
If this were your bridge...

551
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:07,479
你會怎樣來做…？
...how would you get it under way?

552
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:11,274
怎樣來做？
Get it under way, sir?

553
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:14,152
首先 我不會把它修在這
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.

554
01:07:14,402 --> 01:07:16,571
噢 為什麼？
Oh, why not?

555
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:18,365
我可以說…
I was trying to tell you...

556
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:22,494
…小日本不可能再找到比這媮V糕的地點了
...the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.

557
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:25,205
你看到這些橋樁了嗎？
You see those piles?

558
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:27,082
他們正在下沉
They're sinking.

559
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:33,338
他們要經常受到壓力 而他們不可能支撐的住
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.

560
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,632
那你會在哪堳媥禲H
Where would you build it?

561
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:39,844
下游較遠一點的地方 長官 在那些河道狹窄的地方跨越河流
Further downstream, sir. Across those narrows.

562
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:42,931
這樣兩岸都會有堅實的岩床
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.

563
01:07:43,515 --> 01:07:47,936
休斯 如果是你負責修建大橋 你會怎麼安排人手？
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?

564
01:07:48,353 --> 01:07:52,440
絕對不是現在這樣子 正如你看到的 太混亂了
Not the way they're doing it. It's chaos, as you can see.

565
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:56,486
作業互不協調
Uncoordinated activity.

566
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:58,363
相互沒有配合
No teamwork.

567
01:07:59,906 --> 01:08:03,159
很多組的工作相互制約
Some parties are working against each other.

568
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:06,705
是的
Yes.

569
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:13,378
我說 先生們 我們手上有個難題
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.

570
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:16,339
感謝小日本所賜 我們在指揮一群烏合之眾
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.

571
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:19,009
沒有秩序 沒有原則
There's no order, no discipline.

572
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:23,430
- 我們的任務是要重組軍隊 - 是的 長官
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion. - Yes, sir.

573
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,515
那並不容易
Which isn't going to be easy.

574
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:29,269
幸運的是 我們手上有個對象 那座大橋
Fortunately, we have the means at hand. The bridge.

575
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:31,938
- 那座大橋 長官？ - 是的 那座大橋
- The bridge, sir? - The bridge.

576
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:39,029
我們要展示我們西方的效率 給他們上一課 讓他們出出醜
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.

577
01:08:39,237 --> 01:08:41,948
展示我們英軍士兵的能力
Show what a British soldier is capable of.

578
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:44,868
是的 長官 我明白你的意思
Yes. I see your point, sir.

579
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:47,829
我知道這兒環境很艱苦…
I know how difficult it's going to be here...

580
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:50,540
…找不到合手的東西
...where you can't find what you need.

581
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,835
- 這是一個挑戰 - 請原諒 長官
- There's the challenge. - I beg your pardon, sir.

582
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:56,588
你真的要給他們修一座大橋？
You really want them to build the bridge?

583
01:08:56,838 --> 01:08:59,466
你們平時可不是這麼遲鈍的
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.

584
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:02,635
我知道我們的戰士 必須讓他們有活幹
I know our men. You've got to keep them occupied.

585
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:05,930
如果他們沒有事幹 我們就找一些給他們做
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.

586
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:09,058
- 我們會的 長官 - 我們很幸運
- That we would, sir. - So we're lucky.

587
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:11,811
但是我們還要把它造好
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

588
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:14,189
我還知道我們的戰士
Here again I know the men.

589
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:17,442
他們需要在工作中尋找自豪感
It's essential that they take pride in their job.

590
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,277
- 對不對 各位？ - 是的 長官
- Right, men? - Yes, sir.

591
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:22,405
堣 你是這堛疑鶬鉹H員 你在這堶n充當一個工程師
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.

592
01:09:22,655 --> 01:09:26,576
告訴我你需要的 我們會盡量去滿足 我們能幹好嗎？
Tell me what you want and we'll get it. Can we make a go of it?

593
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:29,078
- 我們會幹的很漂亮的 長官 - 很好
- We'll do out best, sir. - Fine.

594
01:09:30,205 --> 01:09:32,624
我們必須先制定計劃…
We must draw up our plans...

595
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:35,960
…然後和Saito開個會議…
...then arrange a conference with Saito...

596
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:38,671
…然後糾正他的錯誤
...and set him straight.

597
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:47,430
那些全是程序上的事情
That takes care of all the procedural matters.

598
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:49,933
噢 是的
Oh, yes.

599
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:54,229
下面我要說的可能相關的人員會不高興
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.

600
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:58,274
我不得不說 大橋的選址是草率的…
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily...

601
01:09:58,483 --> 01:10:00,777
…嗯 或者說是錯誤的
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

602
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,656
錯誤的？
Incorrectly?

603
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,407
很不幸 是的
Unfortunately, yes.

604
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:09,369
我們的技術人員研究了你們選的地點…
Our engineer has made a study of the site...

605
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:12,956
…認為河床太軟
...and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.

606
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,041
太軟？
Too soft?

607
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,752
全是泥漿！ 所有的工作都是無用工
Mud! All the work has been useless.

608
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:19,420
- 堣 請你繼續 - 是的 長官
- Reeves, will you carry on? - Yes, sir.

609
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,005
- 堣 請你繼續 - 是的 長官
- Reeves, will you carry on? - Yes, sir.

610
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:26,427
橋墩的受力會把它們壓到水面以下的
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.

611
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,472
當第一列火車通過的時候 大橋就會倒塌
It would collapse under the first train.

612
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:33,977
這是壓力和泥土形變的圖表 單位是噸/平方英吋
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.

613
01:10:34,185 --> 01:10:39,315
堣 在你深入介紹之前… 上校 我們可以來杯茶嗎？
Reeves, before you get too involved.... Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?

614
01:10:52,537 --> 01:10:56,499
我認為大家都同意了 為了避免災難…
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster...

615
01:10:56,749 --> 01:11:01,879
…我們必須在下游400碼的地方 在堣珙D選的地址上建一座新橋
...we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.

616
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:07,302
現在我們來看下一個問題
Let's proceed to the next point.

617
01:11:07,302 --> 01:11:07,719
現在我們來看下一個問題
Let's proceed to the next point.

618
01:11:08,553 --> 01:11:11,264
我要改變他們的勞動強度
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.

619
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:13,182
- 改變勞動強度？ - 我要增加他們的勞動強度
- Alter? - I've increased it.

620
01:11:13,433 --> 01:11:15,977
從挖土15碼改成2碼
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.

621
01:11:16,227 --> 01:11:18,980
你肯定會贊同這個決定
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.

622
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:22,525
休斯 你來詳細介紹一下
Hughes has all the facts. Would you take over?

623
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:25,778
我仔細研究了一下整個工程
I've done a time study of the entire project.

624
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:29,866
我認為 作業分配是錯誤的
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.

625
01:11:30,116 --> 01:11:33,828
我們應該修改作業分配
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.

626
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:39,208
稍等一下 上校 我們邊吃邊談可能會節約時間
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.

627
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:41,919
我們可以有晚飯吃的吧？
Would it be possible to have dinner?

628
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,379
當然
Of course.

629
01:11:46,924 --> 01:11:48,384
- 繼續 - 是 長官
- Carry on. - Yes, sir.

630
01:11:48,593 --> 01:11:52,472
如果增加班組 細化分工…
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...

631
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:57,060
…那麼 每天的工作量會增加30%
...l'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30?0 .

632
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:00,480
現在 Saito 上校 我還有一點補充…
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....

633
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:06,319
現在 還有一項決定刻不容緩
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.

634
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:08,821
當英軍士兵在修橋的時候…
As the British will work on the bridge...

635
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:11,991
…修建鐵路的人手就少了
...only a few will be available for railway work.

636
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:17,163
你必須用你的人來支援鐵路的修建…
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang...

637
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:21,959
…那樣 鋪軌的工作也能盡快的完成
...so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.

638
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:25,505
我已經下令了
I have already given the order.

639
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:28,841
我們也必須改變你們的工作強度
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.

640
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:33,012
我曾想過定為每天15碼 這樣不會太過疲勞…
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them...

641
01:12:33,262 --> 01:12:35,973
…但是和我們一樣是不是更好一些？
...but isn't it best to be the same as ours?

642
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:39,477
這樣也會形成良性競爭
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.

643
01:12:41,395 --> 01:12:44,649
我已經下令了
I have already given the order.

644
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:47,443
我們會盡善盡美的 對不對 休斯？
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?

645
01:12:47,693 --> 01:12:50,655
我想今晚的議程就到這
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.

646
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:54,325
謝謝你的關注 Saito上校
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.

647
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:57,453
還有問題嗎？
Are there any other questions?

648
01:12:58,913 --> 01:13:00,540
我有一個問題
One question.

649
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:03,709
你能在期限內完成大橋嗎？
Can you finish the bridge in time?

650
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,463
坦率地講 看起來是不可能的
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.

651
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:10,132
當然我們要試一試
But we'll certainly give it a go.

652
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:15,680
別忘了 我們因為分歧而浪費了一個月…
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement...

653
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,765
…當然那不是我的錯
...for which I was not to blame.

654
01:13:19,392 --> 01:13:21,185
還有什麼問題嗎？
Is there anything else?

655
01:13:21,978 --> 01:13:23,062
沒有了
No.

656
01:13:23,688 --> 01:13:27,650
謝謝 會議結束
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

657
01:13:28,776 --> 01:13:31,404
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

658
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:59,974
我希望這些小日本會感激我們所做的
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.

659
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:03,936
雖然現在我還沒有感覺到這一點
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.

660
01:14:04,729 --> 01:14:07,481
- 晚安 科林普頓 - 晚安 長官
- Good night, Clipton. - Good night, sir.

661
01:14:09,608 --> 01:14:11,694
另外 我想告訴你…
By the way, I meant to tell you...

662
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:14,780
…這埵酗@些樹比較像榆樹
...there are trees here similar to elm.

663
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:18,951
倫敦橋的榆樹樁已經支撐了600年了
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.

664
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:22,288
- 600年 堣牷H - 是的 長官
- Six hundred years, Reeves? - Yes, sir.

665
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:25,624
600年
Six hundred years.

666
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:28,336
真是奇跡
That would be quite something.

667
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:21,138
我在找一個美國人 他叫 捨爾斯
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.

668
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:24,642

- Yes, down on the beach. - Oh, thank you very much.

669

Kiss!

670
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:35,569

01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:36,320
那麼多人
Too many eyes.

672

你給了我藥粉 藥片 沐浴 注射 灌腸…
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....

673
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:42,409
其實我只需要愛
All I need is love.

674
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,496
是的 你只需要愛
It's true. All you really need is love.

675
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:53,420
為什麼你這麼肯定你想病休？
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?

676
01:15:53,671 --> 01:15:55,965
因為我內心堣@直是老百姓 寶貝
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.

677
01:15:56,215 --> 01:15:58,342
而且我一直是性情中人
And I always follow my heart.

678

吻一下

01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,521
怎麼會那樣 司令官？
How's that, commander?

680
01:16:11,564 --> 01:16:13,232
不要叫我司令官
Don't call me commander.

681
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,817
太不浪漫了
It's unromantic.

682
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:16,777
你自己也是個軍官
You're an officer yourself.

683
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:19,947
你會喜歡我叫你寶貝上尉嗎？
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

684
01:16:20,197 --> 01:16:22,658
讓我們用平民的稱呼吧 就叫我"先生"吧
Let's be democratic. Just call me "sir."

685
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:23,993
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

686
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,329
厚顏無恥
Brass ahoy.

687
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,915
他來找你
He wants you. He's all yours.

688
01:16:30,124 --> 01:16:32,626
- 我要去游泳了 - 別走！
- I'm going for a swim. - Don't leave me!

689
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:35,796
- 捨爾斯 司令官？ - 是的
- Commander Shears? - Yes.

690
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:37,840
我叫 華登
My name's Warden.

691
01:16:38,215 --> 01:16:39,842
- 你好 - 對不起 打擾了…
- How do you do? - Sorry to intrude...

692
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:42,553
沒事 少校 我習慣了
That's okay, major. I'm used to it.

693
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:43,804

Like a martini?

694
01:16:44,054 --> 01:16:45,806
謝謝 不用了
That's very kind. I think not.

695
01:16:46,056 --> 01:16:47,224
介意我來一點嗎？
Mind if I have one?

696
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:48,809
哪媟d來的？
How did you get that?

697
01:16:49,059 --> 01:16:52,438
有醫院就有酒精
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.

698
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:55,149
噢 那當然
Yes, of course. Jolly good.

699
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:58,068
嗯 我盡量簡潔一些
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

700
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:01,864
我隸屬於316部隊 那是個比較古怪的部門
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.

701
01:17:02,114 --> 01:17:04,575
我們的總部在布坦尼可公園 (Botanical Gardens(植物園))
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.

702
01:17:04,825 --> 01:17:08,078
- 保護稀有植物不被敵人破壞？ - 當然不是
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy? - Not quite.

703
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,206
- 你當真不來一點？ - 不 謝謝
- Sure you won't have one? - No, thanks.

704
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:15,377
我們對你工作過的鐵路很感興趣
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.

705
01:17:15,628 --> 01:17:18,922
你可以給我們很多有價值的情報
You could give us no end of valuable information.

706

嗯 我已經離開那地方已經很多天了…
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days...

707
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:26,013
…而且我把所知的都告訴你們了
...and I told your people everything I know.

708
01:17:26,263 --> 01:17:29,600
但是你可以用一種更特殊的方式來幫助我們
But you could help us in a rather special sense.

709
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:34,980
我知道有點強人所難 但是你能否出來去見一下我們？
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?

710
01:17:36,482 --> 01:17:39,401
如果你想讓我再重複報告一遍的話
If you want to go over the whole thing again.

711
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:42,321

我們是他的部下
We're one of his special pigeons.

那麼今晚怎麼樣？ 8點我會派一輛車來
Shall we say this evening, then? About 8. I'll send a car.

715
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:52,915
今晚？ 不行

你明早怎麼樣？ 10點？

- 再見 - 再見
- Cheerio. - Cheerio.

719
01:18:00,839 --> 01:18:02,091

你很抱歉 你今晚要讓我空等了
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.

722
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:18,357
大錯特錯
You couldn't be more wrong.

723

01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:27,366
舉槍致敬！
Present arms!

726
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:44,007
- 可以看你的通行證嗎？ - 好的
- May I see your pass, please? - Oh, yes.

727
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,857
華登少校的辦公室在路的盡頭
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.

728
01:19:11,702 --> 01:19:15,080
幹得好 Jenkins 幹得好！
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

729

快 湯姆森用你的匕首

站起來！快去指定地點

Come on, move yourselves! Move quickly!

733
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:33,640
動作太笨了 喬依斯
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

734
01:19:34,892 --> 01:19:37,853
要立即用匕首捅 喬依斯
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.

735
01:19:38,103 --> 01:19:40,731
你看 他佔了主動
You see, he's gained the initiative.

736
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:44,735
停下！ 對不起 長官
Wait a minute! I'm terribly sorry, sir.

737
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:47,195
- 你對不起？ - 是的
- You're sorry? - So am l.

738
01:19:47,446 --> 01:19:50,741
- 我以為你是敵人 - 我是美國人 如果你是指這個的話
- I thought you were the enemy. - I'm American, if that's what you mean.

739
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:54,911
- 就這樣 喬依斯 - 是 長官 對不起 長官
- That'll be all, Joyce. - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

我來帶路 他現在應該快下課了
I'll show you the way. He'll finish his lecture any moment now.

743
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:13,263
- 他現在下課了 - 這麼大的聲音
- That's the end of his lecture. - Thunderous ovation.

744
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,643
他認為訓練越接近實戰越好
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.

745
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:22,230
- 華登少校 - 嗯？
- Major Warden, sir? - Yes?

746
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,899
很高興見到你
Good of you to come.

747
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:26,860
- 他們待你還好吧？ - 確實是的
- They took care of you? - They certainly have.

748
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,197
謝謝你 跟我來
Thank you, staff. Well, come along, then.

749
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:33,283
格林上校要見你
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.

750
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:39,831
- 這個地方還不錯吧？ - 我不知道這媮椄O一所軍事學校
- Fascinating place, isn't it? - Didn't know it was a commando school.

751
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:44,961
我們盡量不用這種稱呼 那樣會製造緊張空氣
We're trying to discourage the use of that word. Such a melodramatic air.

752
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:46,630
你在這媟F什麼？
What do you do here?

753
01:20:46,838 --> 01:20:49,257
爆破 摧毀一類的事情
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.

754
01:20:49,508 --> 01:20:52,511
我們使用 PE 塑膠炸藥 很不錯的東西
We're using P.E., plastic explosives. It's wonderful.

755
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:55,389
剛才那個爆炸的炸藥只有這個一半大
That pop was made with a lump half this size.

756
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:59,101
只要硝化甘油炸藥的一半 而威力卻有兩倍
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.

757
01:21:00,352 --> 01:21:03,313
沒引爆的情況下是很安全的
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.

758
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:05,190
謝謝你的介紹
Thanks for telling me.

它完全防水 而且可塑性很好
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.

760
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,277
看到嗎？你可以用它來做你想用它做的事情
See? You can do what you like with it.

761
01:21:12,153 --> 01:21:13,780
這是我的辦公室
This is my place.

762
01:21:19,245 --> 01:21:20,663
這
Go ahead.

763
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:24,928
喔 渴死了 我要來杯茶
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

764
01:21:27,347 --> 01:21:29,599
- 你也來一杯？ - 不 謝謝
- Would you care for one? - No, thanks.

765
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:32,019
- 來杯酒？ - 不 謝謝
- A drink? - No, thank you.

766
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:35,356
- 給我來壺茶 彼得 - 是的 長官
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter. - Very good, sir.

767
01:21:39,278 --> 01:21:40,612
這個你也看得懂？
Do you read this?

768
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:44,741
戰前 我在劍橋教東方語言
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.

769
01:21:48,663 --> 01:21:52,250
我還沒有祝賀你的成功逃亡呢 幹得好！
I never congratulated you on your escape. Good show!

770
01:21:52,459 --> 01:21:56,337
如果你的海上救援飛機沒有看到我 我也不會呆在這
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

771
01:21:56,589 --> 01:21:58,299
是的 我想不會
No, I suppose not.

772
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,138
你願意再來看看你逃出來的地方嗎？
Would you like to see where you were?

773
01:22:05,097 --> 01:22:06,015
好的
All right.

774
01:22:07,726 --> 01:22:11,271
我們的情報很有限 主要來源於你的報告
Our information's scanty. It's based on your report.

775
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:13,315
我們認為戰俘營在這
We think the camp's here.

776
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:17,402
你們是否有尼科爾森上校的消息？
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?

777
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:21,699
他很勇敢 要槍斃他時 他也不眨一下眼睛
He had guts. They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

778
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:25,119
當你要被槍斃的時候 你本來就什麼也不能做
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.

779
01:22:25,495 --> 01:22:29,833
這堿O桂河 這堿O你求助的村子
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.

780
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,668
這堿O鐵路
Here is the railway.

781
01:22:31,877 --> 01:22:34,588
你肯定非常熟悉這一帶
You must be fairly familiar with this area.

782
01:22:34,797 --> 01:22:37,342
不 大部分時間我腦袋堨u是一片空白
No, I was out of my head half the time.

783
01:22:37,592 --> 01:22:41,179
鐵路從新加坡開始 經過馬來西亞…
The railway starts down here in Singapore. Malaya...

784
01:22:41,429 --> 01:22:46,309
…曼谷 仰光 他們想一直貫通到印度
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea is to drive on through, into lndia.

785
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,022
- 我是在哪堻Q救起的？ - 在這堛近
- Where was I picked up? - Oh, about here.

786
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:55,236
日軍想在五月中旬貫通曼谷和仰光
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-  Rangoon section by the middle of May.

787
01:22:55,528 --> 01:22:57,572
我們必須阻止他們
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.

788
01:22:57,822 --> 01:23:00,659
太遠了 轟炸機飛不到這
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.

789
01:23:00,867 --> 01:23:03,203
我們必須用地面部隊把它摧毀
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.

790
01:23:03,454 --> 01:23:06,082
- 那你想怎麼辦？ - 空降之後 徒步到那
- How? - Parachute drop, then march.

791
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:09,210
帶著爆破裝置穿過雨林嗎？
With demolition equipment through that jungle?

792
01:23:09,835 --> 01:23:13,839
我們的主要問題是對那堣@無所知
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.

793
01:23:14,091 --> 01:23:16,635
我們沒有人到過哪
You see, none of us have ever been there.

794
01:23:16,885 --> 01:23:20,097
- 我其實不想讓你失望 但是… - 那很有趣
- I don't want to discourage... - It should be interesting.

795
01:23:20,347 --> 01:23:25,268
格林上校把桂河大橋交給我了 我要帶一隊人去炸掉它
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge. I'm taking a team in to blow it up.

796
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:27,563
你真幸運
Lucky you.

797
01:23:30,275 --> 01:23:31,735
你真的不想來點茶？
Sure you won't have tea?

798
01:23:31,944 --> 01:23:36,532
不 謝謝 我不想失禮 但是我在2點鐘要和一個漂亮的姑娘約會
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.

799
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:40,494
- 如果還有問題的話… - 很抱歉 是的
- If there are any questions.... - Of course, I'm sorry.

800
01:23:43,248 --> 01:23:46,334
嗯 只有一個問題
Well, there is only one question, actually.

801
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:49,045
你覺得再去哪堣@趟怎麼樣？
How would you feel about going back?

802
01:23:51,382 --> 01:23:52,341
什麼？
Come again?

803
01:23:53,509 --> 01:23:56,220
在某種情況下 有點兒…
Under the circumstances it's a bit much...

804
01:23:56,429 --> 01:23:59,598
…但是你是我們完成這個任務的關鍵
...but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.

805
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,643
我們很希望你能和我們一起去
We'd love to have you with us.

806
01:24:03,812 --> 01:24:05,981
這就是你找我來這堛滬鴞]？
That's why you brought me here?

807
01:24:06,231 --> 01:24:07,733
來請我再去哪堣@趟？
To ask me this?

808
01:24:07,984 --> 01:24:09,694
嗯 坦率的說 是的
Well, frankly, yes.

809
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:11,612
我才從那堸k出來
I just got out of there.

810
01:24:11,863 --> 01:24:15,950
我能從那堸k出來 簡直是個奇跡 而你現在卻讓我再回去！ 真荒唐！
My escape was a miracle. Now you want me to go back! Ridiculous!

811
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,452
我知道這很令人為難…
This is embarrassing...

812
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:21,373
我不屬於你們的部隊 我隸屬於美國海軍
I don't belong to you. I belong to the American Navy.

813
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:25,544
事實上 格林上校和你的部隊討論過這件事
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.

814
01:24:25,753 --> 01:24:29,590
- 和我的部隊？ - 你的海軍把你轉借給我們
- With my people? - Your Navy's turned you over to us.

815
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:33,595
昨天早上 從太平洋艦隊指揮部來了一個命令…
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific...

816
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:37,891
確認把你暫借給316部隊
...authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.

817
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,936
- 他們不能這樣做！ - 恐怕他們不這樣認為
- They can't do this! - I'm afraid they have.

818
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:43,939
很遺憾告訴你這個消息
It was hard to break it to you.

819
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:48,694
但是他們不能這樣對我 海軍搞錯了！
But they can't do this to me. I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake!

820
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:56,620
你看 我不是海軍司令官 我甚至不是一名軍官
Look. I'm not a Navy commander. I'm not even an officer.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander. I'm not even an officer.

821
01:24:56,913 --> 01:25:02,043
整個事情都不是真的 我只是一個擦炮筒的普通士兵
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

822
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:08,634
當休斯頓號沉沒的時候 我和一名真正的司令官上岸
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.

823
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:12,054
我們碰上了日軍巡邏隊 他被打死了
We ran into a Japanese patrol. He was killed.

824
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:15,599
我認為只是時間問題 直到我…
I figured it was just a matter of time till l...

825
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,686
所以你和死人換了服裝
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.

826
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:22,899
我認為在戰俘營中軍官會受到較好的待遇
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.

827
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:26,737
但是我遇到的Saito 他命令指揮官和其他人一起勞動
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.

828
01:25:26,987 --> 01:25:29,532
總是有意想不到的事情 對不對？
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

829
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:35,037
我已經有點習慣當司令官了…
I kind of got used to being a commander...

830
01:25:35,288 --> 01:25:37,541
…所以當我來到醫院的時候…
...so when I arrived at the hospital...

831
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:42,921
…我看了一下普通戰士的病房和指揮官的病房…
...l took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward...

832
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:47,760
…然後我對自己說 "就繼續冒充一些時間吧"
...and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."

833
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,720
軍官還真有優待
There were certain advantages.

834
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:51,806
我在海灘上就看到一個
I saw one of them on the beach.

835
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:54,226
這就是整個故事
That's the whole story.

836
01:25:54,476 --> 01:25:58,397
問題是 你不能用我 你需要的是一名指揮官…
The point is, you can't use me. You want an officer...

837
01:25:58,647 --> 01:26:01,525
…一個並不存在的美軍司令官捨爾斯
...an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.

838
01:26:01,776 --> 01:26:04,237
當海軍發現了真相 他們會說:
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:

839
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:07,282
"由於假扮指揮官 把他遣送回家"
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."

840
01:26:08,032 --> 01:26:11,077
- 一旦結果是那樣 我就成功了 - 你就怎樣？
- Once that happens, I've got it made. - Got it what?

841
01:26:11,328 --> 01:26:13,789
成功了！ 我現在想喝點酒
Made! I'd like that drink now.

842
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,293
我想申請病退
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

843
01:26:17,543 --> 01:26:22,464
我會說假裝指揮官是由於在森林中得了神經病
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.

844
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:27,762
甚至 有時我覺得我是海爾森海軍艦隊司令
I'm getting worse. Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

845
01:26:28,514 --> 01:26:30,224
很聰明的計劃
It's quite a clever plan.

846
01:26:31,309 --> 01:26:33,561
不僅僅是是聰明的計劃 而且是簡單安全的
Not only clever, it's foolproof.

847
01:26:33,811 --> 01:26:36,147
如果海軍發現了我的真實身份
If my Navy finds out who I am...

848
01:26:36,397 --> 01:26:40,401
那份命令就是一張廢紙
...those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.

849
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,002
這是你的照片嗎？
Isn't this your photograph?

850
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,717
- 從哪媟d到的？ - 由於你的部隊不能確認你的身份…
- Where did you get this? - It took some doing...

851
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,386
…就費了些事
...since your people couldn't identify you.

852
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:09,433
最後你的太平洋艦隊發了一份你的服役檔案過來
Finally your C- in- C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.

853
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:13,688
照片和指紋 你願意看看嗎？
The photograph, fingerprints. Would you care to have a look?

854
01:27:15,775 --> 01:27:20,029
我們知道你的真實身份已經有一個星期了
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.

855
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:25,493
你的海軍處在一個兩難的境地
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

856
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:27,954
一方面你是個英雄…
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero...

857
01:27:28,205 --> 01:27:30,874
…成功逃出雨林
...for making an escape from the jungle.

858
01:27:31,082 --> 01:27:34,044
同時 因為你假扮指揮官
At the same time, they can't bring you home...

859
01:27:34,253 --> 01:27:37,757
他們又不好把你送回家 然後頒發一枚海軍十字勳章給你
...and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.

860
01:27:37,965 --> 01:27:41,344
我想因此他們很樂意把你轉交給我們
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.

861
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:43,179
你明白了嗎？
You see?

862
01:27:43,387 --> 01:27:44,514
棘手的問題
Hot potato.

863
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,768
說到你的軍階
As far as your rank is concerned...

864
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:51,146
在316部隊 我們並不在意那個
...we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.

865
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,774
你可以假裝你是少校
You'd have the simulated rank of major.

866
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:58,822
假裝上校 那意味著…
A simulated major. That figures.

867
01:28:00,365 --> 01:28:01,741
嗯…
Well....

868
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:08,374
我最好是志願參加
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.

869
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,584
很好！
Good show!

870
01:28:12,045 --> 01:28:13,755
格林上校 長官
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

871
01:28:14,005 --> 01:28:19,135
這是捨爾斯上校 他志願幫助我們炸掉那座橋
This is Major Shears. He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.

872
01:28:19,553 --> 01:28:20,929
真的？
Really?

873
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:23,683
很好！
Good show!

874
01:28:23,933 --> 01:28:26,769
太好了 上校！
Jolly good show, major!

875
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:18,993
去醫務室吧 這隻腳感染了
Get up to sick bay. This foot's infected.

876
01:29:19,244 --> 01:29:21,330
上校會以為我在裝病
Colonel might think I'm malingering.

877
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:24,333
我是醫療官快去吧！
I'm the medical officer. Get cracking!

878
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:33,926
有人願意告訴我為什麼他想建一座真的大橋嗎？
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?

879
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:37,680
不要擔心老尼克他知道自己在幹什麼
Don't worry about old Nick. He knows what he's doing.

880
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:52,280
嘿 柯林普頓該給我們展示一下了
Hello, Clipton. About time you paid us a visit.

881
01:29:52,989 --> 01:29:55,116
我們的小伙子幹得真不錯
Fine job our chaps are doing.

882
01:29:55,368 --> 01:29:57,703
是的 他怎麼樣？
Yes. How's he behaving?

883
01:29:57,953 --> 01:30:00,664
當我們接管過來以後 他已經變得很講理了
He's been most reasonable since we took over.

884
01:30:00,915 --> 01:30:03,793
- 他在想什麼？ - 我不清楚
- What's he thinking? - I haven't the foggiest.

885
01:30:04,043 --> 01:30:06,045
- 謝謝你 堣 - 好的 長官
- Thanks, Reeves. - Right, sir.

886
01:30:06,755 --> 01:30:08,131
你怎麼看？
What do you think?

887
01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:11,676
絕對是個挑戰 對不對？
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

888
01:30:13,846 --> 01:30:18,184
你真認為建這座橋是個好主意嗎？
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?

889
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:20,019
- 你是認真的嗎？ - 是的 長官
- Are you serious? - Yes, sir.

890
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:23,981
一個好主意嗎？ 我們再看看
A good idea? Take another look.

891
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,821
你不認為他們士氣很高嗎？ 你不認為軍紀又得到恢復了嗎？
You don't agree morale is high? Discipline has been restored?

892
01:30:29,071 --> 01:30:31,115
你不認為他們的待遇得到提高了嗎？
Their condition has improved?

893
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:33,909
他們難道沒有更快樂了一些了嗎？
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?

894
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,539
他們吃得也好了 再也得不到虐待
They feed better and they are no longer abused.

895
01:30:37,789 --> 01:30:41,960
坦率地說 柯林普頓 有時我一點也不瞭解你
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.

896
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:44,130
讓我說得更清楚一些
I'll try to make myself clear.

897
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,259
事實上 我們所作的事情可以被理解為…
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as...

898
01:30:48,467 --> 01:30:51,512
…對不起 長官 是通敵合作
...forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.

899
01:30:51,763 --> 01:30:53,390
甚至可以被認為是叛國罪
Perhaps even treason.

900
01:30:53,598 --> 01:30:57,686
我們是戰俘 我們沒有權利拒絕勞動
We're prisoners of war. We haven't the right to refuse to work.

901
01:30:58,061 --> 01:31:01,147
我知道 長官 但是我們一定要做得這麼好嗎？
I understand that, sir. But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir. But must we work so well?

902
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:04,443
我們一定要做得比他們自己還好嗎？
Must we do better than they could themselves?

903
01:31:05,486 --> 01:31:09,866
如果你替Saito做手術 你是會盡力治好他還是殺死他？
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?

904
01:31:10,868 --> 01:31:13,662
你難道不認為懶散會擊垮我們？
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?

905
01:31:13,912 --> 01:31:16,748
讓世人說我們連一件正常的工作都不會做？
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?

906
01:31:16,957 --> 01:31:21,962
這很重要 要讓他們知道 他們不可能在身體或精神上打垮我們
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.

907
01:31:22,255 --> 01:31:24,465
好好看看 柯林普頓
Take a good look, Clipton.

908
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,385
有一天 當戰爭結束
One day the war will be over.

909
01:31:27,594 --> 01:31:30,847
我希望將來那些使用這座橋的人…
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come...

910
01:31:31,098 --> 01:31:34,310
…會記住它是怎麼樣被建成的 是誰修建了他們
...will remember how it was built, and who built it.

911
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,690
不是一群奴隸 而是一群戰士 是一群英國戰士 甚至是在被俘的情況下修建的
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers. British soldiers, even in captivity.

912
01:31:40,108 --> 01:31:42,444
- 是的 長官 - 你是一個好醫生
- Yes, sir. - You're a fine doctor...

913
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:45,530
但是對於戰爭 你還要學習很多
...but you've a lot to learn about the army.

914
01:32:09,265 --> 01:32:10,808
抓住他！ 抓住他！
Hold him! Hold him!

915
01:32:11,059 --> 01:32:15,146
用腳！
Use your boot! Get your boot in there, will you?

916
01:32:22,446 --> 01:32:23,906
早上好！
Good morning!

917
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,591
你們到底在看什麼？
What on earth are you people staring at?

918
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:45,388
用腳踹倒他！
Get him with your boot!

919
01:32:57,985 --> 01:32:59,487
對不起我來遲了 長官
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

920
01:32:59,737 --> 01:33:03,574
遲到4分鐘 你在做內科檢查嗎？
Four minutes, to be exact. You were in need of medical attention?

921
01:33:03,826 --> 01:33:06,453
- 對不起 長官？ - 我是指那個女護士
- Sir? - I was referring to the nurse.

922
01:33:07,413 --> 01:33:10,040
足智多謀 華登 說的一點也不錯
Very ingenious. Warden was right.

923
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,667
請坐
Sit down.

924
01:33:12,377 --> 01:33:16,714
我請你來這 是要你挑選行動小組堛熔艦|個人
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.

925
01:33:16,965 --> 01:33:19,634
- 請喬伊斯先生進來 - 是的 長官
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in. - Yes, sir.

926
01:33:20,301 --> 01:33:23,054
查普曼想要喬伊斯 但是我有疑慮
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.

927
01:33:23,305 --> 01:33:27,101
他有太多的想像力了
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.

928
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,394
我已經告訴過你…
I've told you...

929
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:33,065
…在這個任務中 總會有萬一
...in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.

930
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,694
他在學校堿O游泳最好的
He's the best swimmer in the school.

931
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:40,240
我早已清楚你的觀點 我現在要捨爾斯的意見
I'm well aware of your evaluation. The opinion I want is Shears'.

932
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:45,663
好的 稍息
All right, at ease.

933
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:54,089
這些人想帶你到雨林一遊
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.

934
01:33:54,339 --> 01:33:55,674
是的 長官
Yes, sir.

935
01:33:56,341 --> 01:33:58,594
你在蒙特利爾是個會計師？
You were an accountant in Montreal?

936
01:33:58,844 --> 01:34:01,013
是的 長官 但還不是個正式的會計師
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant.

937
01:34:01,264 --> 01:34:03,391
因為我還沒有得到許可證
That is, I didn't have my charter.

938
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,018
那麼你實際上做什麼呢？
Exactly what did you do?

939
01:34:05,268 --> 01:34:09,230
嗯 長官 我只是核算數據…
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures...

940
01:34:09,481 --> 01:34:11,942
…核算那些別人核算過的數據…
...which people had checked before me...

941
01:34:12,151 --> 01:34:15,613
…然後別人再核算我核算過的數據
...and other people checked them after I had checked them.

942
01:34:15,863 --> 01:34:19,074
- 聽起來很煩人 - 長官 是很煩人
- Sounds a frightful bore. - Sir, it was a bore.

943
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:20,911
你怎麼會在這堛滿H
How did you wind up here?

944
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:26,249
1939年 我去倫敦應徵 後來 我志願來到這
In '39 I came over to London to enlist. Later I volunteered for this work.

945
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:30,253
- 你是志願的！ - 是的 長官 你看 正規部隊…
- You volunteered! - Yes, sir. See, the regular Army...

946
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,131
請繼續 你可以很坦率地說
Go ahead, you can be frank.

947
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:37,637
嗯 正規部隊使我回想起我原來的工作
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.

948
01:34:37,888 --> 01:34:40,098
他們不需要你去思考
They don't expect you to think.

949
01:34:42,392 --> 01:34:44,061
那你思考這個看看
Think about this.

950
01:34:44,353 --> 01:34:47,314
你能用它來殺人嗎？
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?

951
01:34:47,774 --> 01:34:49,067
我知道怎麼使用它
I know how to use it.

952
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:53,321
不是那意思 我問你能用它來殺人嗎？
That's not what I meant. Could you use it in cold blood?

953
01:34:53,571 --> 01:34:55,949
你可以毫不猶豫地殺人嗎？
Could you kill without hesitation?

954
01:34:56,992 --> 01:35:02,122
這個問題我曾經問過自己 它很困擾我
That's a question I've asked myself. It's worried me quite a bit.

955
01:35:02,581 --> 01:35:04,291
那麼答案是什麼？
And what was the answer?

956
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,794
事實上 我並不知道答案 長官
I don't honestly know, sir.

957
01:35:07,504 --> 01:35:10,131
我曾經試圖想像自己…
I've tried to imagine myself....

958
01:35:11,966 --> 01:35:15,970
我很難使自己相信殺戮不是犯罪
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.

959
01:35:16,681 --> 01:35:18,641
那是軍隊堛漱@個古老的問題
It's an old army problem.

960
01:35:19,266 --> 01:35:22,436
嗯 好了 謝謝你 喬伊斯
Well, I think that's all. Thank you, Joyce.

961
01:35:25,023 --> 01:35:26,483
我可以參加行動了嗎？
Am I to go with the team?

962
01:35:27,984 --> 01:35:29,277
我們會讓你知道的
We'll let you know.

963
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:38,079
你們看到了吧
You see what I mean.

964
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:40,206
嗯 至少他是誠實的
Well, at least he was honest.

965
01:35:40,456 --> 01:35:44,961
不到那時候 我們誰也不知道答案
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.

966
01:35:45,379 --> 01:35:47,464
你的意見呢 捨爾斯？
What's your opinion, Shears?

967
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:49,675
嗯 他是加拿大人
Well, he's Canadian.

968
01:35:49,883 --> 01:35:53,929
正好吻合我們這個多國組合行動
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.

969
01:35:54,431 --> 01:35:56,766
如果他想去 他可以替我去！
If he wants to go, he can take my place!

970
01:35:57,559 --> 01:36:01,062
嗯 如果大家都同意喬伊斯去 那就讓他們參加吧
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.

971
01:36:01,772 --> 01:36:04,817
我們對那個村莊進行了空中偵察
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.

972
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:08,028
你們可以在晚上空降到那
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.

973
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:11,490
- 你經過跳傘訓練嗎？ - 沒有 長官
- You've had parachute training? - No, sir.

974
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,411
該死！ 這個可麻煩了
Blast! This is awkward.

975
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:16,872
從來沒遇到過這樣的事情！
Silly, it never occurred to me!

976
01:36:17,414 --> 01:36:18,498
也許 我可以不…
Well, maybe...

977
01:36:18,748 --> 01:36:21,668
我們可以給他安排一些訓練
He's right. Arrange some practice jumps for him.

978
01:36:21,919 --> 01:36:23,796
我現在就去安排
I'll go check right away.

979
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:27,091
- 好的 查普曼 你也可以走了 - 是的 長官
- All right, Chapman, you can run along. - Yes, sir.

980
01:36:29,427 --> 01:36:31,721
嗯 是不是很簡單？
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

981
01:36:31,972 --> 01:36:33,348
是的 長官
Yes, sir.

982
01:36:33,599 --> 01:36:36,268
你不知道你是多麼的重要
You don't realize what a plum you are.

983
01:36:36,518 --> 01:36:40,022
你熟悉那地區 你和那村莊堛漱H結交朋友
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.

984
01:36:40,231 --> 01:36:44,402
就好像整個逃跑 都是我們計劃好的
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.

985
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:51,701
這埵釣ヰF西 你可能會感興趣 新的" L"藥片
By the way, here's something that'll interest you. The new " L" pill.

986
01:36:52,745 --> 01:36:56,290
- " L"藥片？ - 致命毒藥 迅速 無痛
- L pill? - L for lethal. Instant, painless.

987
01:36:56,498 --> 01:36:59,835
比老的型號要好很多 當然是為了被俘時使用
Much better than the old ones. For capture, of course.

988
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:02,589
你是想告訴我不要被活捉
You're telling me not to be taken alive.

989
01:37:02,839 --> 01:37:04,633
算我沒說
I wouldn't recommend it.

990
01:37:05,133 --> 01:37:09,346
如果你們誰受傷了 其他人會把他扔在身後的
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.

991
01:37:09,597 --> 01:37:11,933
在這次行動中 炸毀目標是第一要務
The objective comes first in our work.

992
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,188
你想聽我對這小組的真實評價嗎？ 在他們面前我沒有說
You want my honest evaluation? I didn't want to say in front of them.

993
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:19,233
我明白 請講
I understand, go ahead.

994
01:37:20,692 --> 01:37:23,946
嗯 查普曼很好 在他血管堿y的是冰水
Well, Chapman will be fine. Ice water in his veins.

995
01:37:24,196 --> 01:37:26,949
喬伊斯 嗎… 他會好的
Joyce is.... He'll be okay.

996
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,869
- 華登 我覺得不行 - 為什麼？
- It's Warden I don't get. - Oh? Why not?

997
01:37:30,078 --> 01:37:31,829
他只是個劍橋老師
Cambridge don and all of that.

998
01:37:32,038 --> 01:37:35,625
他就像個玩鞭炮的孩子…
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...

999
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:38,212
他經驗很豐富的
He's not without experience, you know.

1000
01:37:39,088 --> 01:37:43,050
當新加坡陷落的時候 他在後面炸掉了幾座大橋
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.

1001
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,553
還在小日本抓住他之前 安裝了好幾個裝置
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.

1002
01:37:46,805 --> 01:37:50,308
- 真精彩 他… - 長官 有些麻煩
- Fascinating story. He... - Sir, it's most annoying.

1003
01:37:50,558 --> 01:37:55,146
從時間上考慮 他們認為練習跳傘意義不大
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.

1004
01:37:55,398 --> 01:37:59,318
如果你跳一次 只有50%機會受傷
If you make one jump there's only a 50?0 chance of injury.

1005
01:37:59,568 --> 01:38:03,155
跳兩次 80% 3次 他肯定要受傷
Two jumps, 80?0. Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.

1006
01:38:03,406 --> 01:38:07,326
大家的一致的結論是 最好的辦法就是讓捨爾斯…
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do...

1007
01:38:07,536 --> 01:38:10,539
不要訓練 直接去跳下去
...is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.

1008
01:38:10,789 --> 01:38:12,833
帶不帶降落傘？
With or without parachute?

1009
01:38:17,922 --> 01:38:20,133
噢 很好！
Oh, very good!

1010
01:38:23,721 --> 01:38:25,347
帶不帶降落傘！
With or without!

1011
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:23,578
他掛在樹上！
He's in the trees!

1012
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,249
Yai 說我們不能從你的那條路去桂河
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.

1013
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:09,670
有太多的日軍崗哨 我們要迂迴到北方穿越原始森林
There are too many Japanese patrols. We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

1014
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,173
- 那麼誰帶路？ - Yai
- Then who's going to lead? - Yai.

1015
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,968
他恨日本人 他們抓走了這堜狾釭漕k人
He hates the Japanese. They took all his men.

1016
01:40:15,219 --> 01:40:17,972
我們必須用婦女來幫我們搬東西
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.

1017
01:40:18,222 --> 01:40:20,391
- 婦女！ - 她們能勝任的
- Women bearers! - They're capable.

1018
01:40:32,195 --> 01:40:35,282
他說在這媢L夜很危險
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.

1019
01:40:35,533 --> 01:40:39,704
3里外有個日軍崗哨 所以我們要在森林媞恅惜F
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

1020
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:44,667
- 查普曼怎麼辦？ - Yai會把他和傘埋起來
- What about Chapman? - Yai will bury him and his chute.

1021
01:40:44,918 --> 01:40:46,545
有什麼問題嗎？
Is there something wrong?

1022
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:52,426
我正在想你會說他們的語言 而我不會
I was just thinking. You speak Yai's language. I don't.

1023
01:40:52,676 --> 01:40:56,680
他要帶路走我從未走過的路
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.

1024
01:40:56,931 --> 01:41:00,560
那麼還要我來幹什麼呢？
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1025
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:05,106
我知道你的感受 但事情總有萬一 對不對？
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1026
01:41:05,691 --> 01:41:07,401
和查普曼講萬一吧
Tell that to Chapman.

1027
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:09,278
我們開始行動吧！
Let's get cracking!

1028
01:44:13,231 --> 01:44:14,900
你很可愛
You're lovely.

1029
01:44:17,444 --> 01:44:18,695
可  愛
Lovely.

1030
01:44:18,945 --> 01:44:21,156
工作愉快！
Be happy in your work!

1031
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:22,617
是 長官
Yes, sir.

1032
01:44:50,022 --> 01:44:51,398
螞蝗
Leeches.

1033
01:44:51,982 --> 01:44:53,484
螞蝗
Leeches.

1034
01:45:08,793 --> 01:45:12,880
她讓你別動她會把你背上的螞蝗弄下來
She's telling you to hold still. She'll take the leeches off your back.

1035
01:45:13,256 --> 01:45:15,591
像你這樣的女孩怎麼能在這種地方呢？
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?

1036
01:45:15,843 --> 01:45:18,345
我會教你說暹羅語
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1037
01:45:18,595 --> 01:45:22,099
不 太多的交談會壞事
No, that would spoil it. Too much talk always spoils it.

1038
01:45:22,307 --> 01:45:23,767
那玩意兒怎麼了？
What's wrong with that thing?

1039
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:27,688
信號太弱了
It's taken an awful beating. I can't get a strong signal.

1040
01:45:27,939 --> 01:45:33,069
因為這堣S濕又霉！ 雨林堜狾釭漱@切都是這樣
I'll tell you. It's wet, mildewed! Like everything else in this jungle.

1041
01:45:33,486 --> 01:45:35,196
你最好把它扔掉！
You might as well dump it!

1042
01:45:40,286 --> 01:45:42,496
這堿O東京電台 廣播結束
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1043
01:45:42,705 --> 01:45:47,209
提醒您不要緊張…
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy...

1044
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:50,005
…不要盲動
...and never volunteer for anything.

1045
01:46:03,186 --> 01:46:05,230
如果我們還呆在這 我們就出不去了
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.

1046
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:07,733
- 就快譯好了 長官 - 快讀！
- I've got it all decoded, sir. - Read it!

1047
01:46:07,983 --> 01:46:11,820
是 長官 "1 原來說的大橋已經不再建了
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.

1048
01:46:12,029 --> 01:46:14,656
在原址下游的地方 在建新的大橋
New construction downstream from first site.

1049
01:46:14,907 --> 01:46:18,995
2 敵人想在通車典禮上從曼谷到仰光
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train...

1050
01:46:19,203 --> 01:46:22,165
開出一列專列…滿載軍隊和重要人物
...Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.

1051
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:25,044
估計在13號上午到達目的地
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.

1052
01:46:25,252 --> 01:46:28,422
3 同時要炸掉專列
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.

1053
01:46:28,672 --> 01:46:31,800
4 好好幹 玩的開心" 就是這些
Four, good hunting. Have fun." That's all.

1054
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:33,845
一列火車和一座大橋！
A train and a bridge!

1055
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:36,306
我們能及時趕到那媔 長官？
Can we get there in time, sir?

1056
01:46:36,514 --> 01:46:38,975
Yai說我們還有2- 3天的路程
Yai says we're two to three days away.

1057
01:46:39,225 --> 01:46:43,313
如果我們快走的話 我們會在12號日落前趕到那
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.

1058
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,483
搭上一列火車 很值
It's worth it for the train.

1059
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:49,028
好 我們要盡一切辦法 好好幹 玩的開心
Oh, by all means. Good hunting. Good show.

1060
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,238
玩的開心 幹得很好
Jolly good fun. Jolly good.

1061
01:46:52,366 --> 01:46:55,827
如果你沒有修好收音機 我們就不會知道還有一列火車
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.

1062
01:46:56,078 --> 01:46:58,830
總有萬一 對不對？
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1063
01:47:23,983 --> 01:47:26,486
- 半品脫 長官 - 奎寧
- Half a pint, sir. - Quinine.

1064
01:47:28,197 --> 01:47:30,866
嗯 我們回頭再弄
Well, we'll complete this later.

1065
01:47:31,742 --> 01:47:35,246
- 柯林普頓 我們遇到一個問題 - 是嗎 長官？
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis. - Yes, sir?

1066
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:40,292
我與堣 和休斯談過 我們不可能及時建好大橋
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes. We can't finish the bridge on time.

1067
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:42,129
我們人力不夠
We haven't the manpower.

1068
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:45,674
我已經請指揮官參加勞動 但是還不夠
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.

1069
01:47:45,924 --> 01:47:47,509
指揮官也在幹活？
The officers are working?

1070
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,514
我解釋了情況 他們志願參加 但是人還不夠
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.

1071
01:47:51,764 --> 01:47:53,516
為什麼不向 Saito要求一些人？
Why not ask Saito for some men?

1072
01:47:53,766 --> 01:47:56,769
這是我們的任務 要用我們自己最大的資源
This is ours. We'll make the most of our resources.

1073
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,898
這就是我為什麼來和你談 我要病人名單
That's why I came to talk to you. The sick list.

1074
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:03,944
這堻ㄛO病人
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.

1075
01:48:04,194 --> 01:48:08,866
我並不是責備你 但總有一些人要裝病
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.

1076
01:48:09,117 --> 01:48:11,536
保持警惕 這就是我要說的
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.

1077
01:48:11,786 --> 01:48:13,621
過來 我們來看看
Come along, let's see.

1078
01:48:15,082 --> 01:48:16,959
別動 別動
Don't move, don't move.

1079
01:48:20,754 --> 01:48:22,381
Haskins什麼病？
What's wrong with Haskins?

1080
01:48:22,631 --> 01:48:26,260
阿米巴痢疾和發燒 104度
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever. Temperature of 1 04.

1081
01:48:26,511 --> 01:48:28,013
好的 我知道了
Right. I see.

1082
01:48:31,099 --> 01:48:32,309
這個人呢？
And this man?

1083
01:48:32,559 --> 01:48:36,479
腿部潰瘍 如果我昨天多切一點的話 就可以保住這條腿
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.

1084
01:48:36,731 --> 01:48:38,691
要把他派去勞動嗎？
Want to send him out to work?

1085
01:48:38,941 --> 01:48:40,735
不許胡說八道 柯林普頓
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1086
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:46,283
那個人呢？
That man there?

1087
01:48:46,533 --> 01:48:47,743
胳膊感染
His arm's infected.

1088
01:48:47,993 --> 01:48:50,329
這些人的傷大多數都不會徹底痊癒
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.

1089
01:48:50,537 --> 01:48:55,459
我在想 新鮮空氣和輕微的勞動 會比關在這籠子埵n些
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.

1090
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:58,713
- 輕微的勞動？ - 因為擦傷胳膊就把他放在這堙K
- Light duties? - It's not our policy to keep a man...

1091
01:48:58,963 --> 01:49:02,759
- 不符合我們的原則 - 不符合我們的原則？
- ...just because he scratched his arm. - Not our policy?

1092
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:07,014
即使狀態不佳 但是還是可以利用的
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.

1093
01:49:07,264 --> 01:49:10,893
比如清理焊縫啦 收拾現場啦 稍息 貝克
Trimmings and finishing jobs. Stand easy, Baker.

1094
01:49:11,144 --> 01:49:14,731
你想去橋上做些輕微的工作嗎？
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?

1095
01:49:16,358 --> 01:49:18,902
- 隨您吩咐 長官 - 很好
- Anything you say, sir. - Good show.

1096
01:49:20,196 --> 01:49:21,656
你呢？ 有困難嗎
You? Nothing difficult.

1097
01:49:21,906 --> 01:49:24,325
- 我會盡力 長官 - 好樣的
- I'll try, sir. - Good man.

1098
01:49:26,077 --> 01:49:30,831
同志們 不言而喻 我以你們為榮
Look here, men. It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.

1099
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:35,629
但是我們現在遇到困難 如果你們覺得自己能行的話
But we're facing a crisis. For those of you who feel up to it...

1100
01:49:35,879 --> 01:49:39,966
能援助我們一下嗎？ 做一些力所能及的事情 搬搬弄弄 塗塗抹抹？
...how about lending us a hand? Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1101
01:49:40,218 --> 01:49:41,636
怎麼樣？
What do you say?

1102
01:49:41,844 --> 01:49:45,473
- 是的 長官 - 好樣的 跟我來吧
- Yes, sir. - Good show. Come on, follow me.

1103
01:51:28,045 --> 01:51:29,087
10分鐘
Ten minutes.

1104
01:53:27,135 --> 01:53:29,012
要確認他們全都死了
Make sure they're all dead.

1105
01:53:32,474 --> 01:53:33,850
跟我來 喬伊斯
Come on, Joyce.

1106
01:53:36,061 --> 01:53:38,689
用匕首 否則我們會打到自己人
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.

1107
01:53:50,994 --> 01:53:52,662
走那邊 喬伊斯
Go that way, Joyce.

1108
01:56:01,096 --> 01:56:03,932
我可以幹掉他的 我已經準備好了
I could have done it. I was ready.

1109
01:56:08,438 --> 01:56:09,814
你受傷了 長官？
Are you hit, sir?

1110
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:11,483
走
Let's go.

1111
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,552
只是表面傷 不會有骨折
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.

1112
01:56:36,803 --> 01:56:38,930
- 是我的錯 長官 - 噢 住嘴
- It's my fault, sir. - Oh, shut up.

1113
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,682
我可以走的不很嚴重
I can walk on it. That's all that counts.

1114
01:56:41,892 --> 01:56:43,644
是啊 但是還有多遠 我們能走多快呢？
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1115
01:56:43,852 --> 01:56:46,522
不試不知道 對不對？
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?

1116
01:59:59,026 --> 02:00:00,695
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

1117
02:00:01,153 --> 02:00:03,239
我沒有命令停止
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1118
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:04,907
我們都需要休息一下
We all need it.

1119
02:00:08,996 --> 02:00:12,541
我們還要5小時急行軍才能到達目標
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.

1120
02:00:12,749 --> 02:00:14,084
也許要6小時
Maybe six.

1121
02:00:15,127 --> 02:00:16,295
快
Come on.

1122
02:00:16,503 --> 02:00:19,047
如果你一直走的話 你會流血不止而死的
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.

1123
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,684
- 你們必須把我留在這 - 你停下來 我們就停下來
- You're going to leave me here. - If you stop, we stop.

1124
02:00:30,603 --> 02:00:33,230
你不可能在夜堿膍s大橋的結構
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.

1125
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:35,566
你們必須在日落前趕到那
You've got to get there before sundown.

1126
02:00:35,774 --> 02:00:40,446
但是 長官 任務結束後 我們不能保證順這條路返回…
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route...

1127
02:00:40,697 --> 02:00:42,824
即使我們走這條路 也不能保證找到你
...or whether we could find you if we did?

1128
02:00:43,074 --> 02:00:46,620
如果我是你的話 你知道的 我就一點也不猶豫就會離開你
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.

1129
02:00:47,038 --> 02:00:48,289
他不知道 但是我知道
He doesn't know, but I do.

1130
02:00:48,539 --> 02:00:52,001
你會把你媽媽拋棄在這堛 如果規則要求這樣的話
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.

1131
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:56,172
你們必須繼續前進這是命令
You'll go on without me. That's an order.

1132
02:00:56,381 --> 02:00:58,675
捨爾斯 現在由你來指揮
You're in command now, Shears.

1133
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:03,263
我不遵守這條命令
I won't obey that order.

1134
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:05,390
你的英雄主義讓我噁心
Your heroics make me sick.

1135
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:08,394
你們都帶著死亡的臭氣
You carry the stench of death like the plague.

1136
02:01:08,645 --> 02:01:10,855
爆炸 L藥片
Explosives and L- pills go well together.

1137
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:14,692
不是這個就是那個 要麼毀掉大橋 要麼毀掉自己
It's one thing or the other. Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1138
02:01:15,027 --> 02:01:16,737
這場戰爭只是個遊戲
This is just a game, this war.

1139
02:01:16,987 --> 02:01:20,908
你和那個尼科爾森上校都有瘋狂的勇氣 為了什麼？
You and that Colonel Nicholson. You're crazy with courage. For what?

1140
02:01:21,158 --> 02:01:24,119
怎樣才能死的像個紳士 怎樣死才符合規矩…
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules...

1141
02:01:24,329 --> 02:01:28,083
而問題是要怎樣才能像個人那樣活著！
...when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!

1142
02:01:32,087 --> 02:01:34,964
我不會讓你死在這堛 華登…
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden...

1143
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,179
因為我才不管你那個什麼大橋或者你的什麼規則
...because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.

1144
02:01:40,638 --> 02:01:43,307
如果我們繼續前進 我們就一塊走
If we go on, we go on together.

1145
02:01:46,228 --> 02:01:47,896
老Yai 幹得好
Good old Yai.

1146
02:01:59,867 --> 02:02:01,035
好的
All right.

1147
02:02:11,714 --> 02:02:13,007
快過來
Come on.

1148
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:03,980
我們走近些
Let's get closer.

1149
02:03:23,501 --> 02:03:25,712
還在耿耿於懷我們帶你一起來嗎？
Still sorry we brought you along?

1150
02:03:27,381 --> 02:03:29,300
- 感覺好點了嗎？ - 是的
- Feeling better? - Yeah.

1151
02:03:29,508 --> 02:03:31,761
現在還由你指揮
You're in command again, you know.

1152
02:03:31,969 --> 02:03:33,638
謝謝 上校
Thank you, major.

1153
02:03:34,513 --> 02:03:39,518
真奇怪這是一座堅固的 設計得很好的大橋
I can't understand it. It's such a solid, well- designed job.

1154
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:45,108
並不像敵人一貫拼湊的的那種東西
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.

1155
02:03:45,443 --> 02:03:46,694
看
Look.

1156
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:50,573
下面那些可憐的小鬼子
Those poor devils down there.

1157
02:03:50,823 --> 02:03:54,661
可以想像他們被逼著在這樣的條件下建橋的情景
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.

1158
02:03:55,788 --> 02:03:58,791
還有英國軍官在地上工作
They've got a British officer working on his knees.

1159
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:01,126
小日本好像很高興
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.

1160
02:04:02,294 --> 02:04:05,130
如果他知道我們在這 肯定可以鼓舞他的士氣
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.

1161
02:04:24,611 --> 02:04:27,781
如果不是也要炸那火車 我們就可以設置個定時炸彈 然後跑到幾里之外
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.

1162
02:04:28,198 --> 02:04:31,034
我們不知道火車明天是什麼時間通過這堙K
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1163
02:04:31,284 --> 02:04:33,286
我們不得不手動引爆炸藥
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1164
02:04:33,287 --> 02:04:33,538
我們不得不手動引爆炸藥
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1165
02:04:34,163 --> 02:04:36,916
我們可以把炸藥填在橋墩3尺水面下
We'll set the charges against the piles...

1166
02:04:37,166 --> 02:04:40,670
我想…
...about three feet underwater, I should think...

1167
02:04:40,921 --> 02:04:44,258
把主線纜布到下游引爆者那
...and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.

1168
02:04:45,509 --> 02:04:48,345
問題是引爆者應該藏在哪堙H
The problem is where to hide it.

1169
02:04:53,518 --> 02:04:56,563
我們這一邊河流很顯然被日軍佔用
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.

1170
02:04:56,896 --> 02:04:58,773
他們一眼就能發現
They'd spot it at once.

1171
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:05,781
看 你們看到那些樹段和它們下面的岩石了嗎？
Look. Do you see those fallen tree trunks?

1172
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:09,326
在那邊的小沙灘上？
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?

1173
02:05:09,911 --> 02:05:13,415
- 是的 長官 我看到他們了 - 那奡N是我們的引爆位置
- Yes, sir, I see them. - That's our key position.

1174
02:05:14,458 --> 02:05:16,042
雖然在河的那邊…
The wrong side of the river...

1175
02:05:16,293 --> 02:05:19,880
…但是是在有效距離內的唯一藏身之處
...but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.

1176
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,426
當橋被引爆之後…
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1177
02:05:23,885 --> 02:05:26,762
…那個人必須游回來
...whoever's there will have to swim back.

1178
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:28,973
這樣游泳可不好受
It won't be a pleasant swim.

1179
02:05:29,224 --> 02:05:31,768
長官 我的游泳技術是最好的
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.

1180
02:05:34,646 --> 02:05:37,024
看來只能是你了
It looks like your line of country, then.

1181
02:05:37,233 --> 02:05:38,067
謝謝
Thank you.

1182
02:05:38,276 --> 02:05:42,113
捨爾斯 在這個岸邊找個地方掩護喬伊斯
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1183
02:05:42,363 --> 02:05:45,283
Yai會和你一起 當小日本發現喬伊斯時
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...

1184
02:05:45,491 --> 02:05:47,660
你們可以幫助他
...if they make trouble for Joyce.

1185
02:05:47,912 --> 02:05:50,372
理論上總有萬一…
On the theory that there's always one more thing...

1186
02:05:50,623 --> 02:05:55,044
我也會在這邊用迫擊炮牽制他們的
...l'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.

1187
02:05:55,294 --> 02:05:58,672
甚至我還可以對火車來幾下
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.

1188
02:05:58,924 --> 02:06:00,175
都明白了嗎？
All clear?

1189
02:06:00,425 --> 02:06:03,720
還有問題嗎？ 好的 你天一黑就行動
Any questions? Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.

1190
02:06:03,929 --> 02:06:06,765
他們肯定在橋上有崗哨…
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge...

1191
02:06:06,974 --> 02:06:10,811
所以你必須從上游把炸藥送過去
...so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver...

1192
02:06:11,062 --> 02:06:12,897
也就是說要扎一個筏子
...which means building a raft.

1193
02:06:13,105 --> 02:06:14,148
Yai.

1194
02:06:19,154 --> 02:06:21,615
Yai會帶3個婦女幫助你
Yai will take three women to help you.

1195
02:06:21,865 --> 02:06:24,952
還有一個要和我呆在一起 好 開始行動！
One will stay here with me. All right, get cracking!

1196
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:34,545
你知道 如果不是腳踝受傷 喬伊斯的任務就是我的了
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1197
02:06:35,172 --> 02:06:37,049
你認為他行嗎？
You think he'll be all right?

1198
02:06:37,341 --> 02:06:39,760
我覺得可以 要我來處理嗎？
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1199
02:06:40,344 --> 02:06:43,305
如果可以的話 我會讓你和迫擊炮呆在一起
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.

1200
02:06:43,932 --> 02:06:45,183
對不起
I'm sorry.

1201
02:06:45,892 --> 02:06:48,436
結束之後 我希望你能得到病休…
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge...

1202
02:06:48,645 --> 02:06:50,605
而且是毫不困難地得到
...and not the hard way.

1203
02:06:50,814 --> 02:06:52,065
謝謝
Thanks.

1204
02:07:30,233 --> 02:07:31,276
裝彈
Load.

1205
02:08:37,098 --> 02:08:38,391
真漂亮
Beautiful.

1206
02:08:39,142 --> 02:08:40,810
是的 很漂亮
Yes, beautiful.

1207
02:08:41,102 --> 02:08:42,896
一流的工程
A first- rate job.

1208
02:08:43,355 --> 02:08:45,815
我從未想到會做得這麼好
I had no idea it would turn out so well.

1209
02:08:51,197 --> 02:08:53,532
是啊 幹得很漂亮
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1210
02:08:54,743 --> 02:08:56,245
我一直在想…
I've been thinking....

1211
02:08:57,246 --> 02:09:01,875
明天就是我服役28年
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.

1212
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:04,795
28年的和平與戰爭
Twenty- eight years in peace and war.

1213
02:09:06,089 --> 02:09:09,801
我呆在家堛漁伅﹞ㄥW過10個月
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.

1214
02:09:10,385 --> 02:09:12,720
當然 這仍然是完美的人生
Still, it's been a good life.

1215
02:09:14,056 --> 02:09:16,183
我熱愛印度
I love lndia.

1216
02:09:17,768 --> 02:09:20,020
我不可能從頭再來
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1217
02:09:21,689 --> 02:09:23,399
但是 有時候…
But there are times....

1218
02:09:25,068 --> 02:09:29,406
突然你會意識到你又回到了起點
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.

1219
02:09:30,407 --> 02:09:31,950
而你感到彷徨…
And you wonder....

1220
02:09:33,619 --> 02:09:35,663
你問自己…
You ask yourself...

1221
02:09:36,998 --> 02:09:40,251
…人生的意義是什麼…
...what the sum total of your life represents...

1222
02:09:41,043 --> 02:09:44,630
…這樣和那樣又有什麼差別…
...what difference your being there at any time made to anything...

1223
02:09:45,132 --> 02:09:47,759
…這樣和那樣又有什麼差別…
...or if it made any difference at all, really.

1224
02:09:49,386 --> 02:09:52,764
與其他的職業比起來
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.

1225
02:09:53,433 --> 02:09:55,935
我不知道這樣想是否正確的…
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy...

1226
02:09:56,519 --> 02:10:00,314
但是我必須承認 我一直在思考這些問題
...but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines...

1227
02:10:00,566 --> 02:10:02,568
但是我必須承認 我一直在思考這些問題
...from time to time.

1228
02:10:05,654 --> 02:10:07,364
但 今晚…
But tonight....

1229
02:10:08,824 --> 02:10:09,867
今晚…
Tonight....

1230
02:10:13,621 --> 02:10:15,081
糟糕
Blast.

1231
02:10:22,006 --> 02:10:23,466
我得走了
I must be off.

1232
02:10:26,302 --> 02:10:29,680
他們在準備一些娛樂活動
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.

1233
02:11:16,566 --> 02:11:17,859
真可愛
Lovely.

1234
02:13:26,793 --> 02:13:30,088
如果你是
If you were the only

1235
02:13:30,297 --> 02:13:33,050
世上唯一的女孩
Girl in the world

1236
02:13:33,258 --> 02:13:38,388
你是世上唯一男孩
And you were the only boy

1237
02:13:38,807 --> 02:13:41,184
其他的一切都不重要
Nothing else would matter

1238
02:13:41,392 --> 02:13:44,479
在今天
In the world today

1239
02:13:44,979 --> 02:13:47,023
我們要相愛
We could go on loving

1240
02:13:47,233 --> 02:13:50,444
用古老的方式
In the same old way

1241
02:13:51,028 --> 02:13:56,158
伊甸園只是為兩個人而建
A Garden of Eden just made for two

1242
02:18:30,087 --> 02:18:31,922
我代表大家說幾句…
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1243
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:35,217
這是一個愉快的夜晚
...when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.

1244
02:18:36,969 --> 02:18:42,100
明天你們大多數都要轉移到一個新的戰俘營 開始新的工作
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.

1245
02:18:42,558 --> 02:18:46,896
很遺憾你們看不到大橋的首次使用
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.

1246
02:18:47,147 --> 02:18:49,817
你們會很高興的知道這座大橋
You'll be glad to know that the completion...

1247
02:18:50,067 --> 02:18:52,277
所連接的鐵路
...of this link in the railway...

1248
02:18:52,486 --> 02:18:55,864
可以讓我們用火車來
...will enable us to transport the sick and disabled...

1249
02:18:56,116 --> 02:18:59,202
把傷病員運輸到新的營地
...to the new camp by train.

1250
02:19:00,829 --> 02:19:03,790
Saito上校善意的允許
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind...

1251
02:19:03,998 --> 02:19:06,334
我和柯林普頓上校留在最後
...with Major Clipton and the sick men...

1252
02:19:06,585 --> 02:19:10,089
幾天後我們就會會合
...and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.

1253
02:19:12,133 --> 02:19:15,261
現在你們這堛漱u作已經結束了
Now that your work here is finished...

1254
02:19:15,512 --> 02:19:19,558
我想你們有很多人會鬆弛下來
...l suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.

1255
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:22,352
這完全可以理解
That's quite understandable.

1256
02:19:22,644 --> 02:19:25,272
這是很自然的反應
It's a very natural reaction.

1257
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:30,903
但是某年某月某周某天
But one day, in a week, a month, a year...

1258
02:19:31,112 --> 02:19:34,949
在那一天 上帝保佑 我們全部回到自己的家鄉
...on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again...

1259
02:19:35,659 --> 02:19:40,789
你會對自己在這堛漱u作感到自豪
...you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here...

1260
02:19:41,123 --> 02:19:43,834
你會對自己在這堛漱u作感到自豪
...in the face of great adversity.

1261
02:19:45,044 --> 02:19:47,172
你們所做的
What you have done should be...

1262
02:19:48,047 --> 02:19:49,883
我想會是
...and I think will be...

1263
02:19:50,258 --> 02:19:54,888
我們國民 戰士和市民的榜樣
...an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.

1264
02:19:56,098 --> 02:19:58,642
你們光榮地生存下來
You have survived with honour.

1265
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,353
另外
That, and more.

1266
02:20:02,981 --> 02:20:05,108
在這個蠻荒之地
Here in the wilderness...

1267
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:08,862
你們轉敗為勝
...you have turned defeat into victory.

1268
02:20:11,616 --> 02:20:13,659
我祝賀你們
I congratulate you.

1269
02:20:14,202 --> 02:20:15,244
幹得不錯
Well done.

1270
02:20:20,626 --> 02:20:21,919
為了國王
To the king.

1271
02:23:04,306 --> 02:23:05,766
你現在就位了
You're in business.

1272
02:23:05,974 --> 02:23:10,103
還差什麼嗎？ 樹幹 彈藥 背包 水壺 匕首
Now, you got everything? Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1273
02:23:11,773 --> 02:23:14,067
我會直接穿過河流
I'll be directly across the river.

1274
02:23:15,526 --> 02:23:18,446
教授說總要以防萬一
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.

1275
02:23:19,156 --> 02:23:21,367
但我想不起來要防什麼
I can't think of what it could be.

1276
02:23:22,785 --> 02:23:25,329
除了祝你你長命百歲
Except to wish you a long and happy life.

1277
02:23:25,746 --> 02:23:26,830
謝謝
Thank you.

1278
02:25:42,564 --> 02:25:44,024
發生了什麼事情？
What's happened?

1279
02:25:49,197 --> 02:25:50,949
水位降低了
The river's gone down.

1280
02:26:13,181 --> 02:26:15,100
可以看到電線了
You can see the wire.

1281
02:26:15,934 --> 02:26:17,227
炸藥包！
The charges!

1282
02:28:25,536 --> 02:28:27,955
別等火車了
Don't wait for the train.

1283
02:28:28,247 --> 02:28:29,331
現在引爆！
Do it now!

1284
02:28:56,903 --> 02:29:00,740
如果Saito是對的 火車在5到10分鐘後就會過來
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.

1285
02:29:00,992 --> 02:29:03,744
如果你不介意 我想從山頂上看
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.

1286
02:29:03,995 --> 02:29:05,913
為什麼？ 從橋上最好
Why? It's better from the bridge.

1287
02:29:06,163 --> 02:29:09,667
很難解釋 先生 我不想成為這典禮的一部分
It's hard to explain, sir. I'd rather not be a part of it.

1288
02:29:09,918 --> 02:29:14,256
隨你 說真的 有時我真不瞭解你
As you please. Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.

1289
02:29:14,506 --> 02:29:18,844
如你所說 長官 我還要好好學習戰爭
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.

1290
02:29:25,811 --> 02:29:27,187
早上好
Good morning.

1291
02:29:27,438 --> 02:29:29,690
夜堣籉鴙飢C了
River's gone down in the night.

1292
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:15,598
他在幹什麼？
What's he doing?

1293
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:05,528
上校 有古怪
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.

1294
02:32:05,779 --> 02:32:09,450
我認為在火車到來之前 我們應該檢查一下
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.

1295
02:33:08,306 --> 02:33:09,724
他簡直瘋了
He's gone mad.

1296
02:33:09,933 --> 02:33:12,018
他把他帶到那堨h了！
He's leading him right to it!

1297
02:33:12,269 --> 02:33:13,688
可是我們自己人！
