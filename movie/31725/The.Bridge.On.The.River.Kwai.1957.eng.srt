2
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,000
Finish work. Hurry! Go to hut.

3
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,975
Yeah, that figures. Those new prisoners see us digging graves, they might all run away.

4
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:42,605
No time for jokes. Finish work. Dig!

5
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,913
How about putting us on the sick list?

6
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,681
Have a heart, Captain. Put us in the hospital.

7
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,246
You no sick. You never sick.

8
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,021
Why you always play sick, Shears?

9
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,756
Don't want one of these over my head.

10
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,526
Captain Kanematsu, how about a butt?

11
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,367
I give you butt this morning. Both of you.

12
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,102
That's what I mean. I want to return the favor.

13
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,373
When a man gives me something from the goodness of his heart like you gave me that this morning,

14
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,109
I remember it from the heart.

15
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,117
That's why I want you to keep this lighter.

16
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,090
Think I stole it?

17
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,131
It belonged to that English kid we just buried over there.

18
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,134
He willed that lighter to me for a favor I done him.

19
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,365
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.

20
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,032
You funny man, Shears.

21
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,469
You go on the sick list. Him too.

22
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,580
One day, Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him.

23
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,084
Then what?

24
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:01,016
Before that happens, we'll be far away from here, chum.

25
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,093
Let's knock off.

26
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,866
Here lies--

27
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,669
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried. - Thomson.

28
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,399
Ah, yes.

29
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,408
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

30
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,469
serial number 0. 234567...

31
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,643
valiant member of the King's own... or the Queen's own or something...

32
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,348
who died of beriberi in the year of our Lord . 943...

33
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,017
for the greater glory of--

34
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,694
- What did he die for? - Come off it.

35
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,424
No need to mock the grave.

36
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,299
I don't mock the grave or the men.

37
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,530
May he rest in peace.

38
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,099
He found little enough of it while he was alive.

39
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,882
Battalion, halt.

40
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,252
End of the line.

41
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,259
Left turn!

42
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,191
Stand at ease.

43
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,696
Stand easy.

44
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,274
We're going to be a busy pair of gravediggers.

45
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,274
Well done.

46
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,020
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.

47
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,082
- You going to tell him the truth? - Of course not.

48
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,685
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.

49
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,857
My name is Nicholson.

50
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,491
I am Colonel Saito.

51
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:58,714
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...

52
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,878
I welcome you.

53
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:08,382
I am the commanding officer of this camp... which is Camp . 6...

54
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,918
along the great railroad...

55
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,468
which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.

56
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:21,868
You British prisoners have been chosen...

57
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,172
to build a bridge across the River Kwai.

58
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:30,204
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill...

59
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:35,413
and officers will work as well as men.

60
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:41,188
TheJapanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.

61
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,254
If you work hard, you will be treated well.

62
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,062
But if you do not work hard...

63
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,104
you will be punished!

64
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:58,200
A word to you about escape.

65
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,474
There is no barbed wire...

66
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,741
no stockade...

67
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,408
no watchtower.

68
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,976
They are not necessary.

69
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,886
We are an island in the jungle.

70
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,324
Escape is impossible.

71
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,022
You would die.

72
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:23,832
Today you rest. Tomorrow you will begin.

73
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,137
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:

74
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,111
Be happy in your work.

75
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,915
Dismissed!

76
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:47,149
Battalion, stand at ease!

77
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,955
Fall out, Major Hughes.

78
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,690
Hughes, get the men to their quarters. Tell Clipton to see to the sick.

79
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,099
- I'll have a word with this fellow. - Very good.

80
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,608
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

81
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,307
My men will carry on in the way one expects of the British soldier.

82
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,908
Naturally, my officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.

83
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:17,354
You may have overlooked that the use of officers for manual labor...

84
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,857
is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.

85
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,358
Is that so?

86
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,360
I have a copy of the Convention with me...

87
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,397
and would be glad to let you glance through it if you wish.

88
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,161
That will not be necessary.

89
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,339
Attention.

90
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,037
Sit down, please.

91
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,753
Yes, sir.

92
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,268
- I'll speak to Clipton. See you later. - Very good, sir.

93
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,602
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

94
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,538
- How's the arm,Jennings? - Nearly healed, sir.

95
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,771
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.

96
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,641
- Good heavens. - How do you do, sir?

97
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,682
We found him and an Australian in the hospital here.

98
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,946
They're all that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.

99
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,781
The U.S. Navy out here?

100
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,116
For a deepwater sailor, I am sort of landlocked.

101
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,419
- You lost your ship? - The Houston.

102
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,291
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.

103
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,953
And your group here?

104
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,090
Mostly Aussies, some Lime-- some British...

105
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,792
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

106
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,596
What happened to them?

107
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,933
They died...

108
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,635
of malaria, dysentery, beriberi, gangrene.

109
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,879
Other causes of death: famine, overwork...

110
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,814
bullet wounds, snake bites...

111
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,975
Saito...

112
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,078
and then there were some who just got tired of living.

113
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,622
Has Clipton looked at you?

114
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,682
Just about to, sir. Commander, you can finish that shave later.

115
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,194
All right.

116
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,824
You'll stay with the officers, and we'll find some decent clothing.

117
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,596
Don't bother about me, Colonel.

118
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,036
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.

119
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,041
Besides, this is working kit. It's the fashion out here.

120
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,476
The officers in your party did manual labor?

121
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,638
You could call it that.

122
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,978
Actually, I raised that very point with Colonel-- What's his name?

123
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,143
Saito

124
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,743
I think he understands the situation now.

125
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,790
- Is that so? - Yes. He's seems a reasonable type.

126
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,053
I must be pushing on.

127
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,562
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00. Get me a list of your requirements.

128
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,791
Yes, sir.

129
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,267
- Anything we can do. - Thank you, sir.

130
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,963
- What is it? - Never mind.

131
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,838
Go on, say it.

132
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,677
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito, but ''reasonable''?

133
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,715
That's a new one.

134
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,843
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson defines the word differently.

135
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,222
Any other points?

136
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,992
- By your leave, sir. - Yes,Jennings?

137
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,159
About the escape committee, sir. I've talked with Commander Shears--

138
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,396
There won't be any escape committee.

139
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,938
I don't understand, sir. LieutenantJennings has a plan.

140
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:32,409
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan, but escape? Where?

141
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,240
Into this jungle?

142
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,305
Saito was right. No need for barbed wire here.

143
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,476
One chance in a hundred of survival.

144
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,420
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears' experience will back me up on that.

145
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,425
I'd say the odds against a successful escape are a hundred to one.

146
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,451
- Right. - But may I add another word?

147
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,962
Please.

148
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,124
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.

149
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,431
You've seen the graveyard. There are your real odds.

150
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,199
To give up hope of escape, to even stop thinking about it...

151
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,605
is like accepting a death sentence.

152
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,542
Why haven't you tried to escape, Commander?

153
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,604
I've been biding my time, waiting for the right moment, the right company.

154
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,242
I understand how you feel.

155
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,617
Of course, it's normally the duty of a captured soldier...

156
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,121
to attempt escape...

157
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,628
but my men and I are involved in a curious legal point... of which you are unaware.

158
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:29,567
In Singapore, we were ordered to surrender by Command Headquarters. ''Ordered.''

159
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,401
Therefore, in our case, escape might be an infraction of military law.

160
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,962
- Interesting? - Yes, sir.

161
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,465
- Interesting point. - I didn't quite follow you.

162
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,310
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?

163
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,282
Without law, Commander, there is no civilization.

164
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,844
That's just my point: Here there is no civilization.

165
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,947
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.

166
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,050
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.

167
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,988
Is there anything else?

168
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,795
I think we're all clear on the program.

169
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,702
I want everything to go off without a hitch starting tomorrow morning.

170
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,536
Remember this:

171
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,771
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us...

172
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,971
and not by theJapanese.

173
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,416
If they have that idea to cling to, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

174
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,043
Are you with me, Commander?

175
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:29,454
I hope they can remain soldiers, Colonel.

176
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,430
As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave.

177
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,942
Queer bird, even for an American.

178
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,040
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.

179
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,415
Cut off from his unit.

180
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,149
It should be a lesson to all of us.

181
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,055
Attention!

182
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,434
English prisoners!

183
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:20,511
Notice I do not say, '' English soldiers.''

184
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,275
From the moment you surrendered...

185
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,613
you ceased to be soldiers.

186
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,086
You will finish the bridge...

187
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,148
by the . 2th day of May.

188
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:39,789
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer... Lieutenant Mioura.

189
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,900
Time is short.

190
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,629
All men will work!

191
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,901
Your officers will work beside you.

192
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,907
This is only just...

193
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,036
for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.

194
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,014
Your shame is their dishonor.

195
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,780
It is they who told you...

196
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:05,585
'' Better to live like a coolie than die like a hero.''

197
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,115
It is they who brought you here, not I!

198
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,856
Therefore...

199
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,263
they will join you in useful labor.

200
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,097
That is all.

201
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,401
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

202
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,941
Bradley, back in your place.

203
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,440
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito...

204
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,282
to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.

205
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:41,884
'' Belligerents may employ as workmen prisoners of war who are physically fit other than officers--''

206
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,292
- Give me the book. - By all means.

207
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,058
You read English, I take it?

208
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,496
- Do you read Japanese? - I'm sorry, no.

209
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,968
If it's a matter of precise translation, I'm sure that can be arranged.

210
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,061
The code specifically states that the--

211
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,377
Stand fast in the ranks!

212
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:58,843
Stand fast in the ranks!

213
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,435
You speak to me of code?

214
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,607
What code? The coward's code!

215
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,913
What do you know of the soldier's code, of Bushido?

216
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,892
Nothing! You are unworthy of command!

217
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,440
Since you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world...

218
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,413
we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.

219
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,906
My officers will not do manual labor.

220
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,918
We shall see.

221
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,386
All enlisted prisoners to work!

222
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,933
Sergeant Major, take the men to work.

223
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,636
Yes, sir. Battalion, take up tools.

224
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,990
What's he up to?

225
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,504
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.

226
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,220
Now you will be reasonable.

227
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,054
You will order your officers to work.

228
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,187
No

229
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,999
I will count three.

230
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:12,526
If by the third count  you and your officers are not on the way to work...

231
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,505
I will give the order to fire.

232
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,508
He's going to do it.

233
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,146
Believe me, he's really going to do it.

234
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,198
One.

235
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,563
I warn you, Colonel.

236
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,603
Two.

237
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,571
Stop!

238
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,576
I've seen and heard everything.

239
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,210
So has every man in the hospital. There are too many witnesses.

240
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,219
You'll never get away with calling it a mass escape.

241
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,084
- Most of those men can't walk. - Shut up!

242
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,861
Is this your soldier's code, murdering unarmed men?

243
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:28,238
You see, there are certain advantages to being on the sick list.

244
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,298
I'll say this for the old man: He's got guts.

245
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,843
Into the valley of death rode the 600.

246
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,609
- How's that, sir? - That kind of guts.

247
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:42,517
Also the kind they had in . 9. 4, when your officers went over the top... with nothing but a swagger stick.

248
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,056
- I see what you mean. - You don't see what I mean at all!

249
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,922
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.

250
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,232
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to go along too.

251
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:38,133
Arm's almost healed, sir. Really it is.

252
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,575
What about him?

253
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,738
He didn't actually order us not to escape. He only suggested--

254
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,582
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.

255
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,478
Here we go again.

256
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,432
Colonel Saito say, all officers to punishment hut.

257
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,095
Tell them to go.

258
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,810
Not you.

259
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,027
Come.

260
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:58,683
Leave him alone!

261
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,109
They're putting him in the oven.

262
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:24,007
For he's a jolly good fellow

263
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,567
As so say all of us

264
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:31,841


265
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:41,552


266
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,761
Hurray!

267
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,750
Timber!

268
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,163
- One, two, three, pull! - Hurry!

269
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,769
Let go!

270
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,672


271
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,458
You wish to see me?

272
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,828
I've been trying to see you for three days.

273
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,131
It's about Colonel Nicholson. He's been shut up in that hut--

274
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,397
I could have you shot.

275
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:22,174
Those prisoners who tried to escape were in your charge.

276
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,271
I knew nothing about the escape.

277
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,010
It does not matter.

278
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,178
One must even respect those who tried.

279
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:34,190
For a brief moment, between escape and death...

280
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,193
they were soldiers again.

281
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,356
But it is insane to try and escape.

282
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,923
Two soldiers shot...

283
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,992
the third drowned!

284
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,629
To what end?

285
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,141
It was an escape from reality.

286
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,648
Here is reality.

287
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:06,020
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today...

288
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,754
and this shows the position of actual progress.

289
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,291
Because of your colonel's stubbornness...

290
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,697
we are far behind the schedule!

291
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:21,500
That is not all. Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.

292
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,563
Yes, I have seen it.

293
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,666
I could have them all shot.

294
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,405
Then who would build your bridge?

295
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,777
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

296
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,011
Perhaps the men don't work well without their own officers to direct them.

297
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,713
My officers will direct them.

298
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,051
Your officers will work beside them.

299
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:43,217
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide. As he pointed out, it's against the rules.

300
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,626
Do not speak to me of rules!

301
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,755
This is war!

302
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,890
This is not a game of cricket.

303
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:59,273
Your colonel is mad. Quite mad.

304
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,280
Sit down, please.

305
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,351
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.

306
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,016
Thank you.

307
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:19,654
Tell him that if his officers will not work...

308
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,961
I'll be forced to close the hospital...

309
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,595
and your patients will work in their place.

310
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:31,198
Many will die, and he will be responsible.

311
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,439
Go and speak to him. You have five minutes.

312
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,533
The doc's going to see the old man.

313
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,681
Sir?

314
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,647
It's Clipton, sir.

315
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,450
I brought you a few things.

316
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,199
- How are the men? - Fine, sir.

317
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:34,226
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.

318
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,572
And the officers?

319
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,510
They're not so good. They're still in detention.

320
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,175
And LieutenantJennings is dead.

321
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,682
- What? - Killed attempting to escape.

322
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,518
Two others were with him: Corporal Weaver and the American.

323
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,093
Poor, brave lad.

324
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,597
I warned him, didn't I?

325
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,964
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

326
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,334
I'd like to clean you up while I talk.

327
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,808
I've got something to tell you.

328
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,470
I've had a word with Saito.

329
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:19,505
That man's the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.

330
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,418
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

331
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:44,238
- Blackmail. - I know, sir, but he means it.

332
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,744
It's a question of face, pure and simple.

333
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:52,179
- He can't give in. - It's still blackmail.

334
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:59,455
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.

335
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:04,654
And wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?

336
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,798
The men are going as slow on it as they dare...

337
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,166
but Saito's cut their food rations.

338
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,401
If he makes the sick men work, they're going to die.

339
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,708
- That's all there is to it. - Yes, I truly understand...

340
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,476
but it's a matter of principle.

341
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:29,485
If we give in now, there will be no end to it.

342
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:37,050
Sir, we're lost in the jungle a thousand miles from anywhere.

343
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,791
We're under the heel of a man who will stop at nothing to get his way.

344
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:46,803
'' Principle''? No one will ever know or care what happens to us.

345
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,739
- Give in, sir, please. - I'm adamant.

346
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,744
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.

347
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,473
- Time. - All right.

348
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,579
Please thank those concerned.

349
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,554
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.

350
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,420
Reynolds stole the coconut.

351
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,824
We'll be able to get you a little something from time to time.

352
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,397
We've bribed one of your guards.

353
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,338
Good-bye, sir, and good luck.

354
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,840
Many thanks.

355
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,513


356
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,552
Did you say that American chap was killed?

357
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,714
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

358
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:44,191
It's insane to plan escapes.

359
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,664
Three men killed, and to what end?

360
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:52,395
Here is where we must win through.

361
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,824
The doc just looked at us and shook his head. What does that mean?

362
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,455
It means only one thing: The colonel won't give in.

363
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,743


364
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:39,408
It's like this: Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.

365
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,916
It's a question of principle.

366
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,581
As medical officer, I must protest at the way he's being treated.

367
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,681
It's a wonder he's still alive.

368
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,717
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.

369
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:58,191
He is responsible, not I.

370
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,779
You sick?

371
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,542
Are they both mad?

372
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,717
Or am I going mad?

373
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,590
Or is it the sun?

374
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,285


375
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,297


376
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,993


377
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,590


378
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,706
Attention!

379
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:32,144
Battalion, attention!

380
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,878
English prisoners...

381
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,320
let us ask the question...

382
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,847
''Why does the bridge not progress?''

383
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:48,695
You know why. Because your officers are lazy!

384
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:53,168
They think themselves too good to share your burdens.

385
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,761
This is not just.

386
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,104
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.

387
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:03,340
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.

388
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,177
But there is another cause.

389
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,684
I do not hide the truth.

390
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,550
With deep shame and regret...

391
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:18,186


392
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,627
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.

393
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,359
He is a bad engineer.

394
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,833
He is unworthy of command.

395
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:30,806
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.

396
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,545
Tomorrow we begin again.

397
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:40,515
I shall be in personal command.

398
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,881
Today we rest.

399
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:49,784
All work and no play makeJack a dull boy.

400
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:56,231
As a token of regard for your efforts in the future... I give presents to you all.

401
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,644
Let us be happy in our work.

402
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,649
Company, dismiss.

403
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:19,083
Battalion, dismissed.

404
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,272
Take a look at this!

405
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,604
Red Cross?

406
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,441
He's given us our own Red Cross parcels.

407
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,709
Tomorrow we begin again.

408
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:55,207
Harry, look. They're letting the old man out.

409
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,503
Most likely going to give him another pasting.

410
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,918
Good evening, Colonel.

411
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,392
Do you mind sitting over here?

412
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,264
I am having rather a late supper.

413
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:45,686
English corned beef.

414
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,787
No, thank you.

415
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,463
Produce of Scotland.

416
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,532
I prefer it to saki.

417
00:52:59,709 --> 00:52:59,976
I spent three years in London.

418
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:07,617
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

419
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:10,984
- Cheers. - Sorry.

420
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,022
- Later, perhaps. - Perhaps.

421
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:25,702
I was not a good artist. My father disapproved.

422
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,227
He felt I belonged in the army...

423
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:33,004
so I changed from art to engineering.

424
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:37,944
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...

425
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,848
I intend to make a full report of your activities in this camp.

426
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:51,153
I do not think you quite realize my position.

427
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,629
- I must carry out my orders. - Quite.

428
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:59,033
My orders are to complete the bridge by the . 2th day of May.

429
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,867
- Time is short. I only have . 2 weeks. - No doubt.

430
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,773
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.

431
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,971
But no officers, except in an administrative capacity.

432
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:14,039
But officers are working along the entire railway.

433
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,448
You know it! I know it!

434
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,249
I'm not responsible for the actions of other commanding officers.

435
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,017
Personally, I'm appalled.

436
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,321
Let's not get excited.

437
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,797
- Will you have a cigar? - No, thank you.

438
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,467
When I said all officers must work...

439
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:42,136
naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.

440
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:46,672
My orders were only intended for officers below--

441
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,013
None of my officers will do manual labor.

442
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,677
Please.

443
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,780
I was about to say, I have been thinking the matter over...

444
00:54:54,891 --> 00:55:00,796
and decided to put majors and above on administrative duties...

445
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,799
leaving only the junior officers to lend a hand.

446
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,563
I'm afraid not. The Convention's clear on that point.

447
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:26,219
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?

448
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,881
I haven't the foggiest.

449
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,790
I'll have to kill myself.

450
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,057
What would you do if you are me?

451
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,293
I suppose if I were you...

452
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,131
I'd have to kill myself.

453
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,137
Cheers.

454
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,137
I warn you, Colonel.

455
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:51,680
If I am to die, others will die before me.

456
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,340
Do you understand that?

457
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,918
Major Clipton did mention something to that effect.

458
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,613
That won't solve your problem.

459
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,486
I'm sure we can arrive at a proper solution.

460
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,991
Please sit down.

461
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:10,260
Now, tell me, Colonel...

462
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:14,201
do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?

463
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,329
- Of course. - Good.

464
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,669
Take this bridge of yours.

465
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,443
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

466
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,850
I have grave doubts whether your lieutenant--

467
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,378
- What's his name? - Mioura.

468
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:39,384
Is he capable of tackling a job of such importance?

469
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:44,389
On the other hand, my officers Reeves and Hughes...

470
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,834
have built bridges all over India.

471
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,002
The men respect them.

472
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,668
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.

473
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:59,738
If he loses it, he ceases to command. Then there's demoralization and chaos.

474
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:03,718
I would be a poor commander if I allowed that to happen to my men.

475
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,721
Perhaps you are not aware...

476
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,213
that the bridge is now under my personal command.

477
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,059
Really? Are you satisfied with the work?

478
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,563
- I am not! - You prove my point.

479
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,066
I hate the British!

480
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,399
You are defeated, but you have no shame.

481
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:24,133
You are stubborn, but have no pride.

482
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,334
You endure, but you have no courage.

483
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,412
I hate the British!

484
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,741
- It's pointless going on like this. - Stay there!

485
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,958
Stand down!

486
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,342
Battalion, attention!

487
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,087
Battalion, stand at ease!

488
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,725
Please.

489
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:18,392
- Do you know the date today? - I'm afraid I've lost count.

490
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:24,270
It's the anniversary of our great victory over Russia in . 905.

491
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:28,606
Throughout East Asia, we are celebrating this date.

492
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,703
In honor of this occasion...

493
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,045
I have given your troops a day of rest.

494
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:38,484
- Many thanks. - I am declaring a general amnesty.

495
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:42,115
You and your officers may return to your quarters.

496
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,751
As part of this amnesty...

497
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:50,356
it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor.

498
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,624
He's done it.

499
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,941
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

500
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,254
How many men in your party, Corporal?

501
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,883
- I don't really know, sir. - You don't know?

502
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:08,793
Twelve usually, but one of the men took sick suddenly this morning...

503
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:12,300
and it took three or four others to help him to the hospital, sir.

504
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:17,631
He took terrible sick, sir.

505
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:21,609
A corporal should always know exactly how many men he has under him.

506
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,669
Yes, sir.

507
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:28,013
Have you a nervous affliction? If not, stop making those faces.

508
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,646
It may be funny, and I'm sure it's done with the best motives...

509
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,690
but it's not military behavior.

510
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,157
No, sir.

511
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,728
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.

512
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,230
Yes, sir.

513
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,808
- Reeves. - Yes, sir?

514
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,539
Have you ever constructed a bridge across a stream like the Kwai?

515
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:02,380
Yes, sir. Half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal.

516
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:07,320
If this were your bridge, how would you get it underway?

517
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,325
Get it underway, sir?

518
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:15,363
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.

519
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:18,525
- Why not? - As I was trying to tell you, sir...

520
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,898
theJapanese couldn't have picked a worse location.

521
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,995
There's no bottom.

522
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,063
You see those piles?

523
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,075
They're sinking.

524
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:33,306
Our chaps could drive those logs till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.

525
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,215
Where would you build it?

526
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:39,914
Further downstream, sir, across those narrows.

527
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:43,220
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.

528
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:47,991
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?

529
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,467
Not the way they're doing it. It's utter chaos, as you can see.

530
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:58,404
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity; no teamwork.

531
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,903
Some parties are actually working against each other.

532
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,578
Yes.

533
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,377
I tell you, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.

534
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,458
Thanks to theJapanese, we now command a rabble.

535
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,755
There's no order, no discipline.

536
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:23,324
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion. - Yes, sir.

537
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:28,427
It won't be easy, but we have the means at hand.

538
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,302
- The bridge. - ''The bridge,'' sir?

539
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:39,147
We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency... that will put them to shame.

540
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,945
We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.

541
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:44,781
Yes, I see your point, sir.

542
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,914
It's going to be difficult in this godforsaken place...

543
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:50,583
where you can't find what you need.

544
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,958
- But there's the challenge. - I beg your pardon, sir.

545
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,657
You mean you really want them to build a bridge?

546
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,530
You're not so usually slow on the uptake, Evans.

547
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,627
I know our men. You've got to keep them occupied.

548
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,798
If there weren't any work for them to do, we'd invent some.

549
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,969
- That we would, sir. - So we're lucky.

550
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,979
But it will be a proper bridge.

551
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,140
Here again, I know the men.

552
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,515
It's essential that they should take pride in their job.

553
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,315
- Right, gentlemen? - Yes, sir.

554
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:22,482
Reeves, you're the key man in this situation as engineer.

555
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,822
Tell me what you want, and Hughes and I will organize it.

556
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,863
- Can we make a go of it? - We'll do our best, sir.

557
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,990
Fine.

558
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,966
We must draw up our plans...

559
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,335
then arrange a conference with Saito...

560
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,999
and set him straight.

561
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,843
I think that takes care of all the procedural matters.

562
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:50,010
Now-- Oh, yes.

563
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:54,423


564
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:58,018
We feel the position of the bridge was fixed rather hastily...

565
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,789
and incorrectly.

566
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,527
Unfortunately, yes.

567
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,366
Major Reeves, our engineer, has made a careful study of the site...

568
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:12,965
and has come to the conclusion that the river bottom there is too soft.

569
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,973


570
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,045
Mud. All the work up to now has been quite useless.

571
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:21,076
- Reeves, carry on. - Yes, sir.

572
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,015
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.

573
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,519
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.

574
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,386
That bridge would collapse under the first train to cross it.

575
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,722
Look, it's all here.

576
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,057
These are the pressure and soil resistance figures.

577
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,723
Just a moment, Reeves, before you get too involved.

578
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,323
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?

579
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:56,407
Then we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster...

580
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,249
we build a new bridge at the site selected by Major Reeves...

581
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:02,119
400 yards downstream.

582
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,321
Let's proceed to the next point.

583
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,195
I've decided to alter the daily work quota of our men.

584
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,258
- Alter? - Yes, I've increased it...

585
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,837
from a yard and a half of earth moved to two yards.

586
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,998
It's in the general interest, and I was sure you would approve.

587
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,599
Major Hughes has all facts and figures. Hughes, will you take over?

588
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:25,773
Yes, sir. I've done a time study of the entire project.

589
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:29,840
As you can see, the available forces have been badly distributed.

590
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:33,649
I would strongly urge we revise the organization of the working parties.

591
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,280
Just a moment.

592
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:39,418
Colonel, it would save considerable time if we could carry on during dinner.

593
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,929
Would it be possible to have a meal served here?

594
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,430
Of course.

595
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:48,460
Carry on, Hughes.

596
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:52,098
If we increase the number of squads and specialize the functions of each...

597
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:57,008
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30 percent.

598
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,808
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point.

599
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:06,483
There's another important decision that can't be postponed.

600
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,819
As most of the British soldiers will be working on the bridge...

601
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,018
only a small number will be available for railway work.

602
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,891
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito, to lend us some of your own men...

603
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,158
to reinforce the railway gang...

604
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:22,135
so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.

605
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:25,673
I have already given the order.

606
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,835
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.

607
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:33,005
I thought of setting it at a yard and a half, not to overtire them...

608
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,051
but wouldn't it be best if we made it the same as the British soldiers?

609
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:39,245
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.

610
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,651
I have already given the order.

611
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,661
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we? - Yes, sir.

612
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,756
That completes the agenda for this evening.

613
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:54,529
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.

614
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,470
Are there any other questions?

615
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,038
One question.

616
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,738
Can you finish the bridge in time?

617
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:07,543
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible...

618
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:10,983
but we'll certainly give it a go.

619
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:15,682
We mustn't forget that we've wasted over a month through an unfortunate disagreement,

620
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,759
for which I was not to blame.

621
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,629
Is there anything else?

622
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,224
Thank you.

623
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,531
The meeting is closed.

624
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,902
Good night.

625
01:13:55,464 --> 01:14:00,333
I hope theseJapanese appreciate what we're doing for them.

626
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,338
For the moment, I'm not concerned with their appreciation.

627
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,603
Good night.

628
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,778
By the way, sir, I meant to tell you...

629
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,839
there are trees in this forest very similar to elm.

630
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,147
The elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.

631
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:22,280
- Six hundred years? - Yes, sir.

632
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:27,388
That would be something.

633
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,611
Madness.

634
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:21,328
Good morning. I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.

635
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:24,365
- Yes. Down on the beach. - Thank you very much.

636
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:33,636
Kiss!

637
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:35,444


638
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:36,274
Too many eyes.

639
01:15:36,445 --> 01:15:40,905
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas...

640
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,952


641
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,386
It's true. All you really need is love.

642
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:53,258
What makes you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?

643
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:58,399
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover, and I always follow my heart.

644
01:15:58,467 --> 01:15:59,866
Kiss.

645
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:10,104
How's that, Commander?

646
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,779
Don't call me Commander. It's unromantic.

647
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:16,815
Look, you're an officer yourself.

648
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:19,989
How would you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

649
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:22,389
Let's be democratic. Just call me sir.

650
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:23,856
Yes, sir.

651
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:27,495
Brass ahoy.

652
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:29,964
He wants to see you, and he's all yours.

653
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:32,229
- I'm going for a swim. - Don't leave me.

654
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:35,766
- Commander Shears? - Yes.

655
01:16:36,005 --> 01:16:37,870
My name's Warden.

656
01:16:38,007 --> 01:16:39,907
- How do you do? - I'm sorry to intrude.

657
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:43,740
That's okay, Major. I'm used to it by now. Like a martini?

658
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:47,016
- That's very kind, but I think not. - Mind if I have one?

659
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:49,917
- How did you manage to get that? - This is a hospital, Major.

660
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:52,214
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.

661
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:55,024
Of course.Jolly good.

662
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:57,925
I'll be as brief as possible.

663
01:16:58,027 --> 01:17:01,622
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 3. 6.

664
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:04,533
Our headquarters is up in the botanical gardens.

665
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:06,433
Protecting rare plants from the enemy?

666
01:17:06,535 --> 01:17:08,435
Not quite.

667
01:17:08,537 --> 01:17:10,903
- Are you sure you won't have a martini? - No, thanks.

668
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,238
Among other things, we have a particular interest in that railway you worked on.

669
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:18,775
You could give us no end of very valuable information.

670
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:22,051
You know, Major, I'm leaving for the States in a few days...

671
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:24,952
and I've already told your intelligence people everything I know.

672
01:17:25,054 --> 01:17:29,558
Yes, but you could help us in a rather special sense.

673
01:17:29,558 --> 01:17:34,552
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you come out and see us?

674
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:39,568
If you want to go over it again, I'll come.

675
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:42,196
That's very kind of you. Lord Louis will be most grateful.

676
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:44,073
- Lord who? - Mountbatten.

677
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:46,575
- We're one of his special pigeons. - I see.

678
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:50,102
Shall we say this evening then, about 8:00? I'll send a car for you.

679
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:53,082
This evening? Out of the question.

680
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:55,312
Tomorrow morning then, about . 0:00?

681
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:56,516


682
01:17:56,585 --> 01:17:58,610
Thanks very much. Cheerio.

683
01:18:00,589 --> 01:18:02,591
Good luck.

684
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:03,956
Thanks.

685
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:16,105
I know. You're terribly sorry, but you're standing me up tonight

686
01:18:16,105 --> 01:18:18,471
You couldn't be more wrong.

687
01:18:40,646 --> 01:18:43,171
- May I see your pass, sir? - Yes.

688
01:18:46,652 --> 01:18:48,381
Carry on, driver.

689
01:18:56,662 --> 01:18:59,130
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the pathway, sir.

690
01:18:59,165 --> 01:19:01,065
All right. Thanks.

691
01:19:11,677 --> 01:19:15,681
Good show,Jenkins!

692
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:19,481
Come along, Thomson! Use your knife, man!

693
01:19:21,187 --> 01:19:22,688


694
01:19:22,688 --> 01:19:26,283
On your feet, chaps. To the debriefing room quickly. Move!

695
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:31,720
Very clumsy,Joyce.

696
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,204
Always use your knife immediately,Joyce.

697
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:40,706
You see? He's gained the initiative.

698
01:19:40,706 --> 01:19:42,606
Wait a minute.

699
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,711
- I'm terribly sorry, sir. - You're sorry?

700
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:48,839
So am I, sir. I thought you were the enemy, sir.

701
01:19:49,215 --> 01:19:50,716
I'm an American, if that's what you mean.

702
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:54,117
- That will be all. - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

703
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:57,223
What can I do for you, sir?

704
01:19:57,223 --> 01:20:00,351
- I was on my way to see Major Warden. - Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.

705
01:20:00,726 --> 01:20:09,235


706
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:13,239
- That's the end of his lecture, sir. - Thunderous ovation.

707
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:13,739


708
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:17,402
The major believes in keeping training as close to real life as possible, sir.

709
01:20:19,745 --> 01:20:22,213
- Major Warden, sir? - Yes?

710
01:20:22,248 --> 01:20:25,649
Very good of you to come along. Have they been taking care of you?

711
01:20:25,751 --> 01:20:28,982
- They certainly have. - Thank you.

712
01:20:29,255 --> 01:20:33,692
Come along then. Colonel Green is looking forward to meeting you.

713
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,251
Fascinating place, isn't it?

714
01:20:36,762 --> 01:20:39,765
Utterly charming. I didn't realize it was a commando school.

715
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:41,665
We're discouraging the use of that word.

716
01:20:41,767 --> 01:20:44,895
It has such a melodramatic air.

717
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:49,275
- What do you do here? - Sabotage, demolition.

718
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:52,403
We're using plastic explosives now. It's wonderful stuff.

719
01:20:52,778 --> 01:20:55,781
That last little pop was made with a lump half the size of this.

720
01:20:55,781 --> 01:20:59,308
It's twice as powerful as gelignite and only half the weight. Here.

721
01:21:00,286 --> 01:21:03,289
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.

722
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:04,950
Thanks for telling me.

723
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:09,295
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic. See?

724
01:21:09,295 --> 01:21:11,263
You can do what you like with it.

725
01:21:12,298 --> 01:21:14,391
This is my place.

726
01:21:19,305 --> 01:21:21,796
Go ahead.

727
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:25,487
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

728
01:21:27,796 --> 01:21:32,733
- Would you care for one? - No, thanks. - A drink? - No, thank you.

729
01:21:32,801 --> 01:21:35,793
- A pot of tea for one, Peter. - Very good, sir.

730
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:41,139
Do you read this?

731
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:45,474
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.

732
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:52,480
I never congratulated you on your escape. It was a good show.

733
01:21:52,821 --> 01:21:56,825
I was lucky. If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

734
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:58,156
I suppose not.

735
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,833
Would you like to see where you were?

736
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:06,232
All right.

737
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:11,602
Our information's rather scanty. It's mostly based on your report.

738
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,740
But we think the camp is about here.

739
01:22:13,842 --> 01:22:18,347
Do your intelligence people have any idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?

740
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:20,212
He had the guts of a maniac.

741
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:22,249
They were about to shoot him, and he didn't bat an eye.

742
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:25,548
I suppose if you're about to be shot, there isn't a great deal you can do.

743
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:27,651
Here is the River Kwai...

744
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:30,359
and here is the Siamese village where you were helped...

745
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:32,054
and here is the railway.

746
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:34,863
You must be fairly familiar with all this area.

747
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,354
Not really. I was out of my head half the time.

748
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:40,869
Now then, the railway starts down here in Singapore.

749
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:43,372
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.

750
01:22:43,372 --> 01:22:46,375
Their idea is to drive on through into India.

751
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,036
Where was I picked up?

752
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:50,379
About here.

753
01:22:50,379 --> 01:22:55,282
As you know, theJapanese aim to open the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.

754
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:55,884


755
01:22:55,884 --> 01:22:57,886
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.

756
01:22:57,886 --> 01:23:00,889
It's too far for bombers to carry an adequate load...

757
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:03,380
so we shall have to go in and smash it up on the ground.

758
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:06,395
- How will you get there? - Parachute drop and then march.

759
01:23:06,395 --> 01:23:09,853
- With demolition equipment? - Yes.

760
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:14,198
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.

761
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:16,963
None of us have ever been there.

762
01:23:17,406 --> 01:23:20,409
- I don't want to discourage you, but-- - It should be interesting.

763
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,377
Colonel Green has given me the Kwai bridge.

764
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:25,869
I'm taking a team in and blow it up.

765
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:27,279
Lucky you.

766
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:32,921
- Are you sure you won't have tea? - No, thanks.

767
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:36,925
I don't want to be rude, but I have a luncheon date, and she's beautiful.

768
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:40,691
- So if there are any questions-- - Yes, of course. I am sorry.

769
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:48,631
There is only one question, actually. How would you feel about going back?

770
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,839
Come again?

771
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:55,842
I know under the circumstances it's a bit much...

772
01:23:55,944 --> 01:23:59,948
but you do have a unique knowledge for our purpose...

773
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:01,939
and we'd love to have you with us.

774
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:08,150
You mean to tell me you brought me here to ask me this?

775
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:09,958
Frankly, yes.

776
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:14,224
Major, I just got out of there. My escape was a miracle.

777
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:16,363
Now you want me to go back? Don't be ridiculous.

778
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,866
- This is embarrassing. - I can't go back!

779
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:21,663
I don't belong to you. I belong to the American Navy.

780
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:25,974
Actually, Colonel Green has already taken up the manner with your people.

781
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:29,910
- With my people? - Yes, your navy turned you over to us.

782
01:24:29,978 --> 01:24:38,480
A signal arrived yesterday morning from your C in C Pacific... authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 3. 6.

783
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:41,388
- They can't do this to me. - I'm afraid they have.

784
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,459
It was difficult to know how to break it to you.

785
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,410
They can't do this to me.

786
01:24:46,512 --> 01:24:48,537
My navy's made a mistake.

787
01:24:51,517 --> 01:24:52,017


788
01:24:52,017 --> 01:24:57,022
Look, I'm not a navy commander. I'm not even an officer.

789
01:24:57,022 --> 01:25:02,858
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

790
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:08,989
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with an officer.

791
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:12,231
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol, and he was killed.

792
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:16,041
I figured I would be captured, so--

793
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:19,044


794
01:25:19,044 --> 01:25:19,339
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.

795
01:25:19,545 --> 01:25:22,047
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.

796
01:25:22,047 --> 01:25:24,311
- Very sensible. - Not that it did me any good.

797
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:27,052
At Saito's camp, the officers worked along with the rest.

798
01:25:27,052 --> 01:25:29,714
Yes, there's always the unexpected.

799
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:35,356
I got used to being a commander...

800
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:38,063
so when I arrived here at the hospital...

801
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:42,466
I looked at the enlisted men's ward and the officers' ward...

802
01:25:42,568 --> 01:25:48,268
and I said to myself, '' Let's let it ride along for awhile.''

803
01:25:48,574 --> 01:25:50,075
There were certain definite advantages.

804
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:52,009
Yes, I saw one on the beach.

805
01:25:52,077 --> 01:25:54,580
Anyway, that's the whole story.

806
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,174
The point is that you can't use me.

807
01:25:57,583 --> 01:26:01,587
You want an American commander named Shears, and he doesn't exist.

808
01:26:01,587 --> 01:26:03,714
When the Navy brass learns the truth about me, they'll say...

809
01:26:04,089 --> 01:26:07,581
''Ship him home in irons for impersonating an officer!''

810
01:26:07,593 --> 01:26:10,153
Once that happens, I've got it made.

811
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:12,097
- Got it what? - '' Made.''

812
01:26:12,097 --> 01:26:14,657
- I'd like that drink now. - Of course.

813
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,603
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

814
01:26:17,603 --> 01:26:22,905
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.

815
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:28,113
I'm getting worse, you know? Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

816
01:26:28,113 --> 01:26:30,411
That's a clever plan.

817
01:26:31,617 --> 01:26:33,949
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.

818
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:36,622
When my navy finds out who I am...

819
01:26:36,622 --> 01:26:39,648
those temporary orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.

820
01:26:54,139 --> 01:26:56,300
Is this your photograph?

821
01:26:59,144 --> 01:27:02,341
- Where did you get this? - It took a bit of doing.

822
01:27:02,648 --> 01:27:04,650
Naturally, your people couldn't identify you at first.

823
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:09,655
But finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record:

824
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:11,520
the photograph, fingerprints.

825
01:27:11,657 --> 01:27:13,750
It has everything. Would you care to have a look?

826
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,592


827
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:20,461
We've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.

828
01:27:23,168 --> 01:27:26,171
Your navy's in an awkward position.

829
01:27:26,171 --> 01:27:31,131
In one sense, you're a hero for making an escape from the jungle.

830
01:27:31,176 --> 01:27:38,183
But they can't very well bring you home... and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.

831
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:41,687
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over to us.

832
01:27:41,687 --> 01:27:44,690
- You see? - Hot potato.

833
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:47,682
As far as your present rank is concerned...

834
01:27:48,193 --> 01:27:51,697
we're fairly informal about those things in Force 3. 6.

835
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:54,097
So you'll have a simulated rank of major.

836
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,601
A simulated major. That figures.

837
01:28:00,706 --> 01:28:01,832


838
01:28:05,711 --> 01:28:08,714


839
01:28:08,714 --> 01:28:10,944
Good show.

840
01:28:12,217 --> 01:28:16,017
Colonel Green, this is Major Shears.

841
01:28:16,221 --> 01:28:19,725
He has just volunteered to go back and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.

842
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:21,158
Really?

843
01:28:22,227 --> 01:28:23,956
Good show.

844
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:26,629
Jolly good show, Major.

845
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:19,427
Get up to sick bay, Baker. This foot's infected.

846
01:29:19,768 --> 01:29:21,770
The colonel might think I'm malingering, sir.

847
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:24,330
I'm the medical officer. Get cracking.

848
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:34,282
Will someone tell me why the old man wants us to build a proper bridge?

849
01:29:34,282 --> 01:29:37,843
Don't worry about old Nick. He knows what he's doing.

850
01:29:48,296 --> 01:29:49,422


851
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:52,596
It's about time you paid a visit.

852
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:55,531
Fine job our chaps are doing. Really first rate.

853
01:29:55,804 --> 01:29:58,306
Yes. How's he behaving?

854
01:29:58,306 --> 01:30:00,809
He's been most reasonable since we took over.

855
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:03,972
- I wonder what he's thinking. - I haven't the foggiest.

856
01:30:04,312 --> 01:30:06,815
- Thanks, Reeves. - Right, sir.

857
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:09,113
What do you think?

858
01:30:09,317 --> 01:30:11,217
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

859
01:30:14,322 --> 01:30:18,782
Sir, are you convinced building this bridge is a good idea?

860
01:30:18,827 --> 01:30:20,328
- Are you serious? - Yes, sir.

861
01:30:20,328 --> 01:30:24,731
''A good idea''? Let's take another look.

862
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:26,801
You don't agree the men's morale is high...

863
01:30:27,335 --> 01:30:29,337
that discipline has been restored...

864
01:30:29,337 --> 01:30:31,498
that their condition has been improved?

865
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,342
- Aren't they a happier lot? - Yes, sir, but--

866
01:30:34,342 --> 01:30:37,175
They feel better, and they are no longer abused or maltreated.

867
01:30:37,345 --> 01:30:39,347
- That's all true. - Well then?

868
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:42,350
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.

869
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,352
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.

870
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,755
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as...

871
01:30:48,857 --> 01:30:51,860
collaboration with the enemy...

872
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,862
perhaps even as treasonable activity.

873
01:30:53,862 --> 01:30:55,363
Are you all right?

874
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:57,831
We're prisoners of war. We haven't the right to refuse work.

875
01:30:58,366 --> 01:31:01,369
I understand that, sir, but must we work so well?

876
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:05,396
Must we build them a better bridge than they could have built themselves?

877
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:10,038
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?

878
01:31:11,379 --> 01:31:14,041
Would you prefer to see this battalion disintegrate in idleness?

879
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:16,885
Would you have it said that our chaps can't do a proper job?

880
01:31:16,885 --> 01:31:20,082
Don't you realize how important it is to show these people...

881
01:31:20,388 --> 01:31:22,288
they can't break us in body or in spirit?

882
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:24,893
Take a good look.

883
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:27,521
One day the war will be over.

884
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:34,903
I hope the people who use this bridge in years to come... will remember how it was built and who built it.

885
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:37,405
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.

886
01:31:37,405 --> 01:31:40,806
- British soldiers even in captivity. - Yes, sir.

887
01:31:40,909 --> 01:31:45,073
You're a fine doctor, but you've a lot to learn about the army.

888
01:32:09,437 --> 01:32:11,098
Hold it!

889
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:14,840
Use your boot. Get your boot in there.

890
01:32:22,951 --> 01:32:24,350
Good morning.

891
01:32:28,456 --> 01:32:30,356


892
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:40,468
What on Earth are you people staring at?

893
01:32:40,468 --> 01:32:42,368
Get on with your jobs!

894
01:32:43,972 --> 01:32:45,530
Get him with your boot!

895
01:32:58,503 --> 01:33:01,904
- I'm sorry I'm late, sir. - Four minutes late, to be exact.

896
01:33:02,007 --> 01:33:04,009
You were in need of medical attention?

897
01:33:04,009 --> 01:33:07,308
- Sir? - I was referring to the nurse.

898
01:33:07,512 --> 01:33:10,015
Yes, very ingenious. Warden was right.

899
01:33:10,015 --> 01:33:12,279
Sit down.

900
01:33:12,517 --> 01:33:14,178
Now, the main reason I asked you here today...

901
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:17,022
was to help us pick the fourth member of your team.

902
01:33:17,022 --> 01:33:20,014
- Ask Mr.Joyce to come in. - Yes, sir.

903
01:33:20,025 --> 01:33:23,426
Chapman here wants Joyce, but I have my doubts about him.

904
01:33:23,528 --> 01:33:27,464
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.

905
01:33:27,532 --> 01:33:30,535
As I've told you before, in a job like yours, even when it's finished...

906
01:33:30,535 --> 01:33:33,129
there's always one more thing to do.

907
01:33:33,538 --> 01:33:36,041
He's the best swimmer in the school, sir, and we'll need a good swimmer.

908
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:40,000
Yes, I'm well aware of your evaluation, Chapman. I want Shears' opinion.

909
01:33:44,049 --> 01:33:45,949
All right, at ease.

910
01:33:50,555 --> 01:33:54,252
These gentlemen are thinking of taking you for a little hike into the jungle.

911
01:33:54,559 --> 01:33:56,561
Yes, sir.

912
01:33:56,561 --> 01:33:58,586
You were an accountant in Montreal?

913
01:33:59,064 --> 01:34:03,068
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant, sir. That is, I didn't have my charter.

914
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:05,059
Exactly what did you do then?

915
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:09,574
Sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures...

916
01:34:09,574 --> 01:34:16,059
which three or four people had checked before me... and then other people checked them after I had checked them.

917
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:17,582
Sounds a frightful bore.

918
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:19,482
Sir, it was a frightful bore.

919
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:21,142
How did you wind up here?

920
01:34:21,586 --> 01:34:24,089
Sir, in '39, I came over to London to enlist...

921
01:34:24,089 --> 01:34:26,580
and about two years later, I volunteered for this work.

922
01:34:26,591 --> 01:34:30,595
- You volunteered? - Yes, sir. You see, the regular army--

923
01:34:30,595 --> 01:34:32,392
Go ahead. You can be frank.

924
01:34:32,597 --> 01:34:38,103
Sir, the regular army sort of reminded me of my job in civilian life.

925
01:34:38,103 --> 01:34:40,094
They don't expect you to think.

926
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:44,609
Think about this.

927
01:34:44,609 --> 01:34:47,510
Are you quite sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?

928
01:34:47,612 --> 01:34:49,204
I know how to use it, sir.

929
01:34:49,614 --> 01:34:51,616
That's not what I meant.

930
01:34:51,616 --> 01:34:57,122
Could you use it in cold blood? Could you kill without hesitation?

931
01:34:57,122 --> 01:35:02,627
That's a question I've often asked myself, sir. It's worried me quite a bit.

932
01:35:02,627 --> 01:35:04,788
What was the answer?

933
01:35:05,130 --> 01:35:07,632
I don't honestly know, sir.

934
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:10,260
I've tried to imagine myself--

935
01:35:12,137 --> 01:35:16,437
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.

936
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:18,905
It's an old army problem.

937
01:35:19,144 --> 01:35:22,636
I think that's all. Thank you,Joyce.

938
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:29,314
- Am I to go with the team, sir? - We'll let you know.

939
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,424
Now you see what I mean?

940
01:35:38,663 --> 01:35:40,665
At least he was honest about it, sir.

941
01:35:40,665 --> 01:35:45,364
None of us ever knows the answer to that question until the moment arises.

942
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:47,137
What's your opinion, Shears?

943
01:35:48,173 --> 01:35:49,606
He's Canadian.

944
01:35:49,674 --> 01:35:54,577
That's in keeping with the international composition of this outfit.

945
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:56,909
If he wants to go that bad, he can even take my place.

946
01:35:57,182 --> 01:36:01,186
If you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.

947
01:36:01,186 --> 01:36:04,917
Now then, I've had a report from air reconnaissance on that village.

948
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:08,250
There's sufficient clearing to make your jump at last light.

949
01:36:08,693 --> 01:36:11,696
- You've had parachute training? - No, sir.

950
01:36:11,696 --> 01:36:14,460
Blast. This is awkward.

951
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:17,202
Silly, it never occurred to me.

952
01:36:17,202 --> 01:36:19,602
- In that case, maybe-- - Yes, he's right.

953
01:36:19,704 --> 01:36:21,831
We'd better arrange some practice jumps for him immediately.

954
01:36:22,207 --> 01:36:24,209
I'll pop over and check with Freddy right away.

955
01:36:24,209 --> 01:36:25,801
All right, Chapman. You can run along.

956
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:27,610
Yes, sir.

957
01:36:29,714 --> 01:36:33,673
- Feel like a sniff of air? - Yes, sir.

958
01:36:33,718 --> 01:36:36,653
You don't realize what a plum you are for us.

959
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:40,225
Your knowledge of the area, your making friends in that village.

960
01:36:40,225 --> 01:36:44,127
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.

961
01:36:47,232 --> 01:36:51,191
By the way, here's something that will interest you: the new L pill.

962
01:36:52,737 --> 01:36:53,567
- '' L pill''? - L for lethal; instantaneous, painless.

963
01:36:53,738 --> 01:36:56,468


964
01:36:56,741 --> 01:37:00,245
Much better than the old ones. For capture of course.

965
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:02,747
In other words, you're telling me not to be taken alive.

966
01:37:02,747 --> 01:37:05,147
I wouldn't recommend it.

967
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,411
You see, if any of you get hurt or wounded on the trek...

968
01:37:07,752 --> 01:37:09,754
the others will have to leave him behind.

969
01:37:09,754 --> 01:37:12,689
The objective comes first in our work.

970
01:37:12,757 --> 01:37:15,385
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation of this team?

971
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,694
I didn't want to speak out in front of the others.

972
01:37:17,762 --> 01:37:19,730
I understand. Go ahead.

973
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:24,166
Chapman will be fine. Ice water in his veins.

974
01:37:24,269 --> 01:37:27,170
Joyce is-- He'll be okay.

975
01:37:27,272 --> 01:37:30,275
- It's Warden I don't get. - Why not?

976
01:37:30,275 --> 01:37:32,175
Cambridge don and all that.

977
01:37:32,277 --> 01:37:35,780
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers, but--

978
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,338
He's not without experience.

979
01:37:39,284 --> 01:37:42,036
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind and blew up a couple of bridges...

980
01:37:42,036 --> 01:37:44,789
one or two trains and I don't know how many other installations...

981
01:37:44,789 --> 01:37:46,291
before theJaps caught him.

982
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:48,759
- ''Caught him''? - Yes. Fascinating story.

983
01:37:49,294 --> 01:37:50,795
Sir, it's most annoying.

984
01:37:50,795 --> 01:37:52,797
They say, in view of the time element...

985
01:37:52,797 --> 01:37:55,800
they don't think a few practice jumps would be worthwhile.

986
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:59,554
They say if you make one jump, you've only got 50% chance of injury...

987
01:37:59,554 --> 01:38:03,308
two jumps, 80% and three jumps, you're bound to catch a backache.

988
01:38:03,308 --> 01:38:07,210
The consensus is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do...

989
01:38:07,312 --> 01:38:10,815
is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.

990
01:38:10,815 --> 01:38:13,079
With or without parachute?

991
01:38:18,323 --> 01:38:20,416
Very good, old man.

992
01:38:23,828 --> 01:38:25,796
''With or without--''

993
01:39:22,887 --> 01:39:23,945
He's in the trees.

994
01:40:02,927 --> 01:40:07,864
Yai says we'll never reach the Kwai by the route you took. There are too many Japanese patrols now.

995
01:40:07,932 --> 01:40:09,934


996
01:40:09,934 --> 01:40:10,298
We'll have to swing north through heavy jungle.

997
01:40:10,435 --> 01:40:12,437
- Who's leading? - Yai himself.

998
01:40:12,437 --> 01:40:15,133
He hates theJapanese. They've taken all his men for railroad work...

999
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,238
which means we shall have to use women bearers.

1000
01:40:18,443 --> 01:40:19,444


1001
01:40:32,457 --> 01:40:35,426
- Women bearers. - They're very capable, I'm told.

1002
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:37,655
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village.

1003
01:40:37,962 --> 01:40:39,964
There's an enemy post about three miles away...

1004
01:40:39,964 --> 01:40:42,933
so we shall have to sleep in the jungle.

1005
01:40:43,468 --> 01:40:44,969
- What about Chapman, sir? - Yai's people will bury him...

1006
01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:47,335
and his chute.

1007
01:40:47,472 --> 01:40:49,736
Is there something wrong?

1008
01:40:49,974 --> 01:40:52,738
I was just thinking.

1009
01:40:52,977 --> 01:40:54,945
You speak Yai's language, I don't.

1010
01:40:54,979 --> 01:40:56,879
He's leading you back to the river Kwai himself...

1011
01:40:56,981 --> 01:41:00,883
by a route I never took.

1012
01:41:00,985 --> 01:41:05,388
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1013
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:07,651
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected.

1014
01:41:07,992 --> 01:41:09,391
Tell that to Chapman.

1015
01:41:57,024 --> 01:41:58,389
Let's get cracking.

1016
01:44:13,661 --> 01:44:15,060
Go ahead.

1017
01:44:17,665 --> 01:44:19,166


1018
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:21,566
You're lovely.

1019
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:23,102
Be happy in your work.

1020
01:44:50,197 --> 01:44:53,132
Yes, sir.

1021
01:45:09,233 --> 01:45:13,237
Leeches.

1022
01:45:13,237 --> 01:45:15,831
She's telling you to hold still. She wants to take the leeches off you.

1023
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,743
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

1024
01:45:18,743 --> 01:45:22,440
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese, if you like. That would spoil it.

1025
01:45:22,747 --> 01:45:24,749
Too much talk always spoils it.

1026
01:45:24,749 --> 01:45:27,752
- What's wrong with that thing,Joyce? - I don't know, sir.

1027
01:45:27,752 --> 01:45:29,379
It's taken a beating. I can't get a strong signal.

1028
01:45:29,754 --> 01:45:31,756
I'll tell you what's wrong with it.

1029
01:45:31,756 --> 01:45:33,656
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten...

1030
01:45:33,758 --> 01:45:35,419
like everything else in this rotten jungle.

1031
01:45:40,765 --> 01:45:42,960
You might as well dump it.

1032
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:44,769
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1033
01:45:44,769 --> 01:45:47,260
This is your friendliest enemy...

1034
01:45:47,772 --> 01:45:50,172
reminding you to take it easy...

1035
01:46:03,287 --> 01:46:05,380
and neer olunteer for anything.

1036
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:07,792
If we stay here much longer, we'll be up to our necks.

1037
01:46:07,792 --> 01:46:12,296
- I have it all decoded, sir. - Right. Read it.

1038
01:46:12,296 --> 01:46:14,958
Yes, sir. ''One: Original bridge works reported abandoned.

1039
01:46:15,299 --> 01:46:20,304
New construction downstream from first site. Two: Enemy intends to open railway...

1040
01:46:20,304 --> 01:46:25,037
with passage of special train, Bangkok for Rangoon... with troops and VI P...

1041
01:46:25,309 --> 01:46:28,996
estimated to arrive target morning . 3th.

1042
01:46:28,996 --> 01:46:30,815
Three: You should synchronize demolition with passage this train.

1043
01:46:30,815 --> 01:46:31,804


1044
01:46:32,316 --> 01:46:33,818
Four: Good hunting. Have fun.'' That's all, sir.

1045
01:46:33,818 --> 01:46:36,378
A train and a bridge would be something.

1046
01:46:36,821 --> 01:46:39,255
Yes, sir, that would really be a show. Can we get there in time, sir?

1047
01:46:39,323 --> 01:46:43,783
Yai says we're two to three days' march from the Kwai.

1048
01:46:43,828 --> 01:46:45,830
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the . 2th.

1049
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:47,331
It's worth having a go for the train, don't you think?

1050
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:49,060
By all means.

1051
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:51,335
Good hunting. Good show.

1052
01:46:51,335 --> 01:46:55,271
Jolly good fun.

1053
01:46:55,339 --> 01:46:58,672
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.

1054
01:47:04,565 --> 01:47:08,126
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1055
01:47:24,084 --> 01:47:26,484
Heave!

1056
01:47:28,589 --> 01:47:30,921
- Half a pint, sir. - Quinine.

1057
01:47:32,092 --> 01:47:36,096
We'll complete this later.

1058
01:47:36,096 --> 01:47:40,499
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis. - Yes, sir?

1059
01:47:40,601 --> 01:47:45,504
I've spoken with Reeves and Hughes, and we won't finish the bridge on time. We just haven't the manpower.

1060
01:47:45,606 --> 01:47:47,506
I've asked the officers to help and they've agreed, but that won't do it.

1061
01:47:47,608 --> 01:47:51,544
The officers are working on the bridge?

1062
01:47:51,612 --> 01:47:54,376
Yes. I explained the situation, and they volunteered, but it's not enough.

1063
01:47:54,615 --> 01:47:57,117
- Ask Saito for some of his men. - Wouldn't dream of it.

1064
01:47:57,117 --> 01:48:00,109
This is our show. We must use our own resources.

1065
01:48:00,621 --> 01:48:04,124
I came to talk to you about the sick list.

1066
01:48:04,124 --> 01:48:05,455
Sir, there's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.

1067
01:48:05,626 --> 01:48:09,663
Don't jump to conclusions.

1068
01:48:09,663 --> 01:48:12,132
No reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.

1069
01:48:12,132 --> 01:48:14,327
Be honest. Keep an open mind is all I ask.

1070
01:48:15,636 --> 01:48:17,001
Come along. Let's see.

1071
01:48:21,141 --> 01:48:22,643
Don't move.

1072
01:48:22,643 --> 01:48:24,645
What's the matter with Haskins?

1073
01:48:24,645 --> 01:48:27,671
He has amebic dysentery and blackwater fever.

1074
01:48:31,151 --> 01:48:33,654
- His temperature was . 04 last night. - Right, I see.

1075
01:48:33,654 --> 01:48:36,623
- And this man? - Leg ulcers.

1076
01:48:36,657 --> 01:48:38,750
I may be able to save the leg if I do some more cutting tonight.

1077
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:41,024
Do you really want to send him out to work, sir?

1078
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:48,168
Don't talk rot.

1079
01:48:48,168 --> 01:48:50,671
- And that man there? - His arm's infected.

1080
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:53,840
Most of them are so run-down, their wounds won't heal properly.

1081
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,176
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air and light duties...

1082
01:48:56,176 --> 01:48:56,677


1083
01:48:56,677 --> 01:49:01,181
might do him more good than being cooped up here. It's not our policy to keep a man in the hospital...

1084
01:49:01,181 --> 01:49:02,683


1085
01:49:02,683 --> 01:49:07,143
just because he scratched his arm, is it?

1086
01:49:07,688 --> 01:49:09,690
A man may not be on the top of his form, but he can still make himself useful...

1087
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,055
trimming and finishing jobs.

1088
01:49:11,191 --> 01:49:14,388
Stand easy, Baker.

1089
01:49:16,697 --> 01:49:19,029
Tell me, do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?

1090
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,758
- Anything you say, sir. - Good show.

1091
01:49:22,202 --> 01:49:24,568
What about you? Nothing difficult.

1092
01:49:26,206 --> 01:49:28,003
- I'll try, sir. - Good man.

1093
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:31,177
Look here, men.

1094
01:49:31,211 --> 01:49:33,441
It goes without saying, I'm proud of all of you...

1095
01:49:33,714 --> 01:49:38,218
but we are facing a crisis.

1096
01:49:38,218 --> 01:49:42,222
For those who feel up to it, how about lending the others a hand? Fetch and carry. A spot of paint here and there.

1097
01:49:42,222 --> 01:49:45,783
What do you say?

1098
01:51:27,327 --> 01:51:29,192
- Yes, sir. - Good show. Follow me.

1099
01:53:26,947 --> 01:53:29,711
Ten minutes.

1100
01:53:32,452 --> 01:53:33,885
Make sure they're all dead.

1101
01:53:35,956 --> 01:53:39,084
Come on,Joyce.

1102
01:53:50,971 --> 01:53:52,836
Use your knife, man, or we'll be shooting each other.

1103
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,092
Go that way.

1104
01:56:08,608 --> 01:56:10,110
I could have done it. I was ready.

1105
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:11,543
Are you hit, sir?

1106
01:56:33,133 --> 01:56:36,636
Let's go.

1107
01:56:36,636 --> 01:56:39,070
It's superficial. There's nothing broken.

1108
01:56:39,139 --> 01:56:41,641
- It's my fault, sir. - Shut up,Joyce.

1109
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:46,101
I can walk on it. That's all that counts now.

1110
01:59:59,339 --> 02:00:01,307
- Yeah, but how far and how fast? - We won't know till I try.

1111
02:00:01,341 --> 02:00:03,343
What are you doing?

1112
02:00:03,343 --> 02:00:04,935
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1113
02:00:08,848 --> 02:00:13,119
We all need it.

1114
02:00:13,119 --> 02:00:14,854
We're still five hours fast march from the objective.

1115
02:00:14,854 --> 02:00:16,321


1116
02:00:16,856 --> 02:00:19,620
Maybe six. Come on.

1117
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:22,555
You keep walking on that foot, you'll bleed to death.

1118
02:00:26,866 --> 02:00:29,869
Yeah.

1119
02:00:29,869 --> 02:00:33,706
- You're going to leave me here. - If you stop, we stop.

1120
02:00:33,706 --> 02:00:35,875
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.

1121
02:00:35,875 --> 02:00:40,335
You've got to get there before sundown.

1122
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:42,780
Sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route...

1123
02:00:42,882 --> 02:00:46,682
or whether we could find you if we did.

1124
02:00:46,886 --> 02:00:48,683
If you were in my shoes, you know I wouldn't hesitate to leave you here.

1125
02:00:48,888 --> 02:00:51,049
He doesn't know it, but I do.

1126
02:00:52,892 --> 02:00:55,895
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.

1127
02:00:55,895 --> 02:00:57,453
You'll go on without me. That's an order.

1128
02:01:01,401 --> 02:01:03,665
You're in command, Shears.

1129
02:01:03,903 --> 02:01:07,039
I won't obey that order.

1130
02:01:07,039 --> 02:01:08,908
You make me sick with your heroics. There's a stench of death about you.

1131
02:01:08,908 --> 02:01:10,910
You carry it in your pack like the plague.

1132
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:13,045
Explosives and L pills go well together.

1133
02:01:13,045 --> 02:01:14,603
With you, it's just one thing or the other:

1134
02:01:15,181 --> 02:01:16,916
destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1135
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:18,816
This war is just a game.

1136
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:20,909
You and that Colonel Nicholson are two of a kind.

1137
02:01:21,421 --> 02:01:24,424
Crazy with courage! For what?

1138
02:01:24,424 --> 02:01:28,121
How to die like a gentleman. How to die by the rules.

1139
02:01:31,931 --> 02:01:36,163
The only important thing is how to live like a human being!

1140
02:01:36,436 --> 02:01:40,440
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden...

1141
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,034
because I don't care about your bridge and your rules.

1142
02:01:46,446 --> 02:01:48,437
If we go on, we go on together.

1143
02:01:59,959 --> 02:02:01,483
Good old Yai.

1144
02:02:11,971 --> 02:02:13,336
I'm all right.

1145
02:03:02,522 --> 02:03:04,319
Come on.

1146
02:03:23,026 --> 02:03:25,995
Let's get closer.

1147
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:29,532
Still sorry we brought you along?

1148
02:03:29,532 --> 02:03:31,591
- Feeling better? - Yeah.

1149
02:03:32,035 --> 02:03:34,435
You're in command again.

1150
02:03:34,537 --> 02:03:36,039
Thank you, Major.

1151
02:03:36,039 --> 02:03:39,440
I can't understand it.

1152
02:03:42,045 --> 02:03:45,037
It's such a solid, well-designed job.

1153
02:03:45,548 --> 02:03:46,947
Not like the temporary bridges the enemy usually throws together.

1154
02:03:48,551 --> 02:03:50,610
Look.

1155
02:03:51,054 --> 02:03:53,105
Those poor devils down there.

1156
02:03:53,105 --> 02:03:54,936
Imagine being forced to build something like that...

1157
02:03:55,058 --> 02:03:59,062
in the condition they must be in.

1158
02:03:59,062 --> 02:04:01,360
They've got a British officer working down there on his knees.

1159
02:04:01,564 --> 02:04:05,728
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.

1160
02:04:12,575 --> 02:04:15,578


1161
02:04:15,578 --> 02:04:19,981


1162
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:27,774


1163
02:04:27,774 --> 02:04:29,207
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale a little. If it wasn't for the train, we could set a time fuse and leave.

1164
02:04:29,275 --> 02:04:31,410


1165
02:04:31,410 --> 02:04:34,038
But since we don't know what time it will cross tomorrow morning...

1166
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:37,550
we'll have to do the job manually.

1167
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:40,383
We'll set the charges against the piles...

1168
02:04:40,787 --> 02:04:44,188
about three feet under the water, I should think...

1169
02:04:45,792 --> 02:04:48,260
and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.

1170
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:56,701
The problem is where to hide it.

1171
02:04:56,803 --> 02:04:58,862
Our side of the river is quite obviously used by theJapanese.

1172
02:05:02,809 --> 02:05:05,972
They'd spot it at once.

1173
02:05:06,312 --> 02:05:09,315
Look. You see those fallen tree trunks...

1174
02:05:09,315 --> 02:05:11,044
and the gray rock just below them on that little beach?

1175
02:05:11,317 --> 02:05:13,512
Yes, sir, I see them.

1176
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:15,788
That's our key position.

1177
02:05:15,822 --> 02:05:19,519
It's on the wrong side of the river...

1178
02:05:21,327 --> 02:05:23,693
but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.

1179
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:26,731
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1180
02:05:26,833 --> 02:05:29,131
whoever's there will have to swim back.

1181
02:05:29,335 --> 02:05:31,838
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.

1182
02:05:31,838 --> 02:05:34,340
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.

1183
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:37,935
Yeah.

1184
02:05:38,344 --> 02:05:41,780
- It looks like your line of country. - Thank you, sir.

1185
02:05:41,848 --> 02:05:44,851
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can coverJoyce.

1186
02:05:44,851 --> 02:05:47,649
Yai will be with you, so you two should be able to occupy the Nips...

1187
02:05:47,854 --> 02:05:50,516
if they make any trouble forJoyce.

1188
02:05:50,857 --> 02:05:55,294
On the theory that there's always one more thing to do...

1189
02:05:55,361 --> 02:05:58,364
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion if necessary.

1190
02:05:58,364 --> 02:06:00,264
I might even take a few potshots at the train.

1191
02:06:00,366 --> 02:06:03,733
All clear?

1192
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:05,337
Any questions? Right. We'll start as soon as it's dark.

1193
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:08,207
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge...

1194
02:06:08,207 --> 02:06:10,607
so you'll have to float the stuff down...

1195
02:06:10,877 --> 02:06:13,812
from upriver...

1196
02:06:18,885 --> 02:06:20,944
which means building a raft.

1197
02:06:21,387 --> 02:06:25,050
Yai will take three women to help you build the raft.

1198
02:06:27,393 --> 02:06:28,553


1199
02:06:29,896 --> 02:06:33,332
One will stay here with me. Get cracking.

1200
02:06:33,399 --> 02:06:34,832
If it wasn't for my ankle, I'd takeJoyce's assignment.

1201
02:06:34,901 --> 02:06:37,028
I know.

1202
02:06:37,403 --> 02:06:39,906
Do you think he'll be all right?

1203
02:06:39,906 --> 02:06:41,965
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1204
02:06:42,408 --> 02:06:45,411
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.

1205
02:06:45,411 --> 02:06:48,346
- I know. - I'm sorry.

1206
02:06:48,414 --> 02:06:50,143
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge...

1207
02:06:50,416 --> 02:06:51,849
and not the hard way.

1208
02:07:29,956 --> 02:07:31,355
Thanks.

1209
02:08:37,023 --> 02:08:40,823
Load.

1210
02:08:41,027 --> 02:08:42,722
- Beautiful. - Yes, beautiful.

1211
02:08:43,029 --> 02:08:46,055
A first-rate job.

1212
02:08:49,035 --> 02:08:53,062
I had no idea it would turn out so well.

1213
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:56,940
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1214
02:08:57,043 --> 02:09:01,707
I've been thinking.

1215
02:09:02,048 --> 02:09:05,848
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.

1216
02:09:06,052 --> 02:09:10,352
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

1217
02:09:10,556 --> 02:09:13,150
I don't suppose I've been at home more than ten months in all that time.

1218
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:16,028
Still, it's been a good life.

1219
02:09:17,563 --> 02:09:20,031
I love India.

1220
02:09:21,567 --> 02:09:24,764
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1221
02:09:25,071 --> 02:09:29,098
But there are times...

1222
02:09:30,576 --> 02:09:33,579
when suddenly you realize you're nearer the end than the beginning.

1223
02:09:33,579 --> 02:09:36,275
You wonder...

1224
02:09:36,582 --> 02:09:40,882
you ask yourself...

1225
02:09:41,087 --> 02:09:45,091
what the sum total of your life represents...

1226
02:09:45,091 --> 02:09:47,355
what difference your being there at any time made to anything...

1227
02:09:49,595 --> 02:09:52,598
or if it made any difference at all really.

1228
02:09:52,598 --> 02:09:55,692
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.

1229
02:09:56,102 --> 02:10:00,439
I don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy...

1230
02:10:00,439 --> 02:10:04,500
but I must admit I've had some thoughts along those lines...

1231
02:10:05,611 --> 02:10:09,775
from time to time.

1232
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:14,518
But tonight--

1233
02:10:21,627 --> 02:10:23,527
Blast.

1234
02:10:26,132 --> 02:10:28,464
I must be off.

1235
02:11:16,182 --> 02:11:17,615
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.

1236
02:13:26,312 --> 02:13:30,616
Lovely.

1237
02:13:30,616 --> 02:13:33,319
If you were the only

1238
02:13:33,319 --> 02:13:38,723
Girl in the world

1239
02:13:38,824 --> 02:13:41,327
And you were the only boy

1240
02:13:41,327 --> 02:13:44,728
Nothing else would matter

1241
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:47,025
In the world today

1242
02:13:47,333 --> 02:13:50,336
We could go on loing

1243
02:13:50,336 --> 02:13:54,340
In the same old way

1244
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:56,331
A garden of Eden

1245
02:18:29,565 --> 02:18:31,624
Just made for two

1246
02:18:32,067 --> 02:18:34,763
I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say...

1247
02:18:36,572 --> 02:18:42,033
this has been an enjoyable evening.

1248
02:18:42,077 --> 02:18:46,741
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.

1249
02:18:47,082 --> 02:18:49,846
It's a pity you won't be here to see the first practical use of the bridge.

1250
02:18:50,085 --> 02:18:52,087
However, you'll be glad to know...

1251
02:18:52,087 --> 02:18:56,141
the completion of this link in the railway...

1252
02:18:56,141 --> 02:18:59,508
will enable us to transport the sick and the disabled...

1253
02:19:00,596 --> 02:19:02,826
to the new camp by train.

1254
02:19:03,098 --> 02:19:06,499
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me...

1255
02:19:06,602 --> 02:19:10,038
to stay behind with Major Clipton and the sick men...

1256
02:19:12,107 --> 02:19:15,110


1257
02:19:15,110 --> 02:19:15,508
and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.

1258
02:19:15,611 --> 02:19:19,911
Now that your work here is finished...

1259
02:19:20,115 --> 02:19:22,515
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.

1260
02:19:22,618 --> 02:19:24,609
That's quite understandable.

1261
02:19:26,622 --> 02:19:30,649
It's a very natural reaction.

1262
02:19:31,126 --> 02:19:35,028
But one day, in a week, a month, a year...

1263
02:19:35,130 --> 02:19:38,817
or that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again...

1264
02:19:38,817 --> 02:19:41,136
you're going to feel very proud...

1265
02:19:41,136 --> 02:19:44,128
of what you have achieved here...

1266
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:48,041
in the face of great adversity.

1267
02:19:48,143 --> 02:19:50,145
What you have done should be...

1268
02:19:50,145 --> 02:19:52,147
and I think will be...

1269
02:19:52,147 --> 02:19:55,708
an example to all our countrymen...

1270
02:19:56,151 --> 02:19:58,278
soldier and civilian alike.

1271
02:19:59,655 --> 02:20:02,658
You have survived with honor.

1272
02:20:02,658 --> 02:20:05,160
That and more...

1273
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:08,129
here in the wilderness.

1274
02:20:10,666 --> 02:20:15,160
You have turned defeat into victory.

1275
02:20:20,676 --> 02:20:22,075
I congratulate you. Well done.

1276
02:23:04,339 --> 02:23:05,841
The King.

1277
02:23:05,841 --> 02:23:09,777
You're in business.

1278
02:23:09,845 --> 02:23:11,472
You got everything? Stand, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?

1279
02:23:11,847 --> 02:23:13,838
Yes.

1280
02:23:15,350 --> 02:23:18,410
I'll be directly across the river.

1281
02:23:18,854 --> 02:23:22,312
The professor says there's always one more thing to do...

1282
02:23:22,357 --> 02:23:25,360
but I can't think of what it could be...

1283
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:26,793
except to wish you a long and happy life.

1284
02:25:42,497 --> 02:25:44,692
Thank you.

1285
02:25:48,503 --> 02:25:51,006


1286
02:25:51,006 --> 02:25:52,030


1287
02:26:13,028 --> 02:26:15,258
What's happened?

1288
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:18,158
You can see the wire.

1289
02:28:25,627 --> 02:28:27,925
The charges.

1290
02:28:28,129 --> 02:28:29,528
Don't wait for the train.

1291
02:28:57,158 --> 02:28:58,591
Do it now.

1292
02:28:58,660 --> 02:29:00,992
If Saito's information is correct...

1293
02:29:01,162 --> 02:29:04,063
the train should be along in five or ten minutes.

1294
02:29:04,165 --> 02:29:06,167
If you don't mind, sir, I'll watch the ceremonies from up on the hill.

1295
02:29:06,167 --> 02:29:09,671
Why? You'll get a better view from the bridge.

1296
02:29:09,671 --> 02:29:11,104
It's hard to explain, sir, but I'd rather not be a part of it.

1297
02:29:11,172 --> 02:29:14,198
As you please.

1298
02:29:14,676 --> 02:29:18,772
Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.

1299
02:29:25,687 --> 02:29:27,177
As you once said, sir, I have a lot to learn about the army.

1300
02:29:27,689 --> 02:29:29,589
Good morning.

1301
02:31:13,795 --> 02:31:15,422
River's gone down in the night.

1302
02:32:02,343 --> 02:32:05,642
What's he doing?

1303
02:32:05,847 --> 02:32:09,248
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.

1304
02:33:07,892 --> 02:33:09,894
I think we'd better have another look around before that train comes across.

1305
02:33:09,894 --> 02:33:11,896
He's gone mad.

1306
02:33:11,896 --> 02:33:13,796
He's leading him right to it.

1307
02:33:57,942 --> 02:34:00,672
Our own man.

1308
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,525
I was right. There is something going on.

1309
02:34:58,002 --> 02:34:59,435
You have to do it, boy.

1310
02:35:02,006 --> 02:35:04,008
You have to do it now!

1311
02:35:04,008 --> 02:35:06,033
Colonel Saito, have you a knife?

1312
02:35:06,511 --> 02:35:07,011


1313
02:35:07,011 --> 02:35:07,636
I just realized the bridge has been mined.

1314
02:35:14,018 --> 02:35:15,542
'' Mined''?

1315
02:35:21,042 --> 02:35:23,544
Good boy.

1316
02:35:23,544 --> 02:35:25,876
British officer, sir, here to blow up the bridge.

1317
02:35:26,047 --> 02:35:27,674
- Blow up the bridge? - Yes, sir.

1318
02:35:28,049 --> 02:35:29,500


1319
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:31,092
British commando orders, sir.

1320
02:35:32,053 --> 02:35:33,520
Look out. There's no time.

1321
02:35:40,561 --> 02:35:43,029
Help!

1322
02:35:43,064 --> 02:35:45,794
Kill him!

1323
02:35:47,068 --> 02:35:49,832
Let me go, sir. You don't understand, sir.

1324
02:36:54,635 --> 02:36:56,125
Kill him!

1325
02:36:57,638 --> 02:37:00,141


1326
02:37:00,141 --> 02:37:01,108


1327
02:37:12,653 --> 02:37:14,348
You?

1328
02:38:23,224 --> 02:38:24,589
What have I done?

1329
02:38:37,738 --> 02:38:41,139
Madness!

1330
02:38:41,242 --> 02:38:43,744
I had to do it.

1331
02:38:43,744 --> 02:38:45,336
They might have been captured alive.

1332
02:39:21,782 --> 02:39:27,448
It was the only thing to do!

1333
02:40:43,864 --> 02:40:46,833
