1
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,084
Finish work

2
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,482
Go to hut

3
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,161
Yeah  that figures

4
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:35,997
If the new prisoners see us digging graves  they may run

5
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:39,160
No time for jokes  Finish work

6
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,282
Dig  dig

7
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,957
How about putting us on sick list

8
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:47,162
Have a heart  captain  Put us in hospital

9
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:50,565
You no sick  You never sick

10
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,157
Why you always play sick  Shears

11
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:56,166
Don't want one of these over my head  I guess

12
00:04:57,408 --> 00:04:58,602
Captain Kanematsu

13
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,402
how about a butt

14
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:04,208
I give you butt this morning  Both of you

15
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:07,520
That's what I mean  I want to return the favor

16
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:10,401
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart

17
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:14,357
like you gave me that butt  I remember it from the heart

18
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,366
That's why

19
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,358
I want you to keep this lighter

20
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:25,966
Think I stole it

21
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,762
It belonged to that English kid we just buried

22
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,602
He gave it to me for a favor I'd done him

23
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,681
Before I pass on  I want to do the same for you

24
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:37,362
You funny man  Shears

25
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:42,959
You go on sick list  Him too

26
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:47,765
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him

27
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,566
then where'll we be

28
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:54,365
Before that happens we'll be far away from here  chum

29
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:56,566
Far away

30
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:59,159
Okay  let's knock off

31
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:02,761
Here lies

32
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,206
I forgot who we just buried

33
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:07,642
Thomson

34
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:09,162
Ah  yes

35
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,280
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson

36
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:15,157
serial number zero one two three four five six seven

37
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:20,158
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something

38
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,761
who died of beri beri in the year of our Lord  1943

39
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,358
for the greater glory of

40
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:30,599
What did he die for   Come off it

41
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,964
No need to mock the grave

42
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,163
I don't mock the grave or the man

43
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:39,159
May he rest in peace

44
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:44,482
He found little of it while he was alive

45
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:38,838
"A" Company  mark time

46
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:55,006
Mark time

47
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:07,322
Halt

48
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:13,287
Into line  left turn

49
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,366
Stand easy

50
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:27,162
We're going to be busy gravediggers  Weaver

51
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,561
Well done  well done

52
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,203
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for

53
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,359
You going to tell him the truth

54
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,802
Of course not

55
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:46,760
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman

56
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,481
My name is Nicholson

57
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,557
I am Colonel Saito

58
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:39,564
In the name of His Imperial Majesty

59
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,565
I welcome you

60
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:45,557
I am the commanding officer of this camp

61
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:48,681
which is Camp 16

62
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,158
along the great railroad

63
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:56,363
which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon

64
00:11:57,808 --> 00:12:01,596
You British prisoners have been chosen

65
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:04,885
to build a bridge across the River Kwai

66
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:09,887
It will be pleasant work  requiring skill

67
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:14,758
And officers will work as well as men

68
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,123
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed

69
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:25,121
If you work hard  you will be treated well

70
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,767
But if you do not work hard

71
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:31,436
you will be punished

72
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:36,163
A word to you about escape

73
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:39,368
There is no barbed wire

74
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,566
No stockade

75
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:43,481
No watchtower

76
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,001
They are not necessary

77
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,768
We are an island in the jungle

78
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,846
Escape is impossible

79
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:55,762
You would die

80
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,163
Today you rest  Tomorrow you'll begin

81
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:07,247
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:

82
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,201
"Be happy in your work "

83
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,757
Be happy in your work

84
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,602
Dismissed

85
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:23,484
Battalion  stand at ease

86
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,081
Fall out  Major Hughes

87
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:27,364
Battalion  stand easy

88
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:30,563
Hughes  get the men to their quarters  See who's sick

89
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:33,038
I'm going to have a word with this fellow

90
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,957
I heard your remarks just now  sir

91
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:44,758
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier

92
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:48,199
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct

93
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:52,361
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labor

94
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:54,923
is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention

95
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,322
Is that so

96
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,166
I have a copy of the convention

97
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:01,246
and would be glad to let you glance through it

98
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:03,758
That will not be necessary

99
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,160
Sit down  please

100
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,802
Yes  sir

101
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:41,357
I'm going to have a word with Clipton

102
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,802
Clipton  don't let me interrupt

103
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:46,766
How's the arm   Nearly healed

104
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:50,318
Sir  this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy

105
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:51,722
How do you do  sir

106
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,566
We found him and an Australian

107
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:55,759
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp

108
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:57,600
U S  Navy  Out here

109
00:15:57,848 --> 00:15:59,759
I am sort of landlocked

110
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:02,078
You lost your ship   The Houston

111
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,604
I made it ashore  but I got separated from the other survivors

112
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,201
And your group here

113
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,564
Mostly Aussies  Some lime

114
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,963
Some British  Indians  Burmese  Siamese

115
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:13,760
And what happened to them

116
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:15,367
They died

117
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:20,559
of malaria  dysentery  beri beri  gangrene

118
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,002
Other causes of death:

119
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:26,161
Famine  overwork  bullet wounds  snakebites

120
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,041
Saito

121
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:31,447
Then there were some who just got tired of living

122
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:32,882
Has Clipton seen you

123
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:36,120
Just about to  Come over here  you can shave later

124
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,447
All right

125
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:42,765
You'll stay with the officers

126
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:44,600
We'll find some decent clothing

127
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,207
Don't bother about me

128
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:48,564
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list

129
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,527
Besides  this is working kit  It's the fashion here

130
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:53,798
The officers in your party did manual labor

131
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,646
I think you could call it that

132
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,961
I raised that very point with Colonel what's his name

133
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,362
Saito

134
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:03,366
I think he understands now   Is that so

135
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:06,760
Yes  I must say he seems quite a reasonable type

136
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,805
Well  I must be pushing on

137
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,766
There's an officer's meeting at 7

138
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,761
Give me a list of your requirements   Yes  sir

139
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:15,682
Anything we can do

140
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,520
Thank you  sir

141
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,998
What is it   Never mind

142
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:23,567
Go on  say it

143
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,807
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito

144
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:30,358
but reasonable  that's a new one

145
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:33,566
Perhaps Col  Nicholson defines the word differently

146
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,402
Any other points

147
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,047
By your leave  sir   Jennings

148
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:48,200
About the escape committee  I've spoken with Cmd  Shears

149
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,200
There won't be any escape committee

150
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,882
I don't understand  sir  Lt  Jennings has a plan

151
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,801
Yes  yes  I'm sure Jennings has a plan  but escape

152
00:17:56,048 --> 00:18:00,280
Where  Into this jungle  That fellow  Saito  is right

153
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:04,362
No need for barbed wire here  One chance in 100 of survival

154
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:08,564
I'm sure a man of Cmdr  Shears' experience will back me up on that

155
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:12,397
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 100 to one

156
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,356
But may I add another word

157
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:15,802
Please

158
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:19,045
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse

159
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,166
You've seen the graveyard  They're your real odds

160
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,562
To give up hope of escape

161
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:27,005
to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence

162
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:29,808
Why haven't you tried to escape  commander

163
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:33,757
I'm biding my time  Waiting for the right moment  the right company

164
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:35,959
I understand how you feel

165
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,880
Of course  it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape

166
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,881
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point

167
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,198
of which you are unaware

168
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:49,963
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters

169
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:51,806
Ordered  mind you

170
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:56,366
Therefore  in our case  escape might well be an infraction of military law

171
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:57,802
Interesting point  sir

172
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:00,482
I'm sorry  sir  I didn't quite follow you

173
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:04,158
You intend to uphold the letter of the law  no matter what it costs

174
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:06,968
Without law  commander  there is no civilization

175
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,446
That's just my point  Here  there is no civilization

176
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:13,367
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it

177
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:16,562
I suggest we drop the subject of escape

178
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:20,159
Is there anything else

179
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:24,759
I think we're clear on the program

180
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:28,478
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning

181
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:30,201
And remember this:

182
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,360
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us

183
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,485
and not by the Japanese

184
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:39,801
So long as they have that idea  they'll be soldiers and not slaves

185
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:42,039
Are you with me there  commander

186
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,365
I hope they can remain soldiers  colonel

187
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,638
As for me  I'm just a slave

188
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:53,884
A living slave

189
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:08,765
Queer bird  Even for an Ameri

190
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:11,882
He's been in isolation too long  poor chap

191
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:14,541
Cut off from his unit  It should be a lesson to all of us

192
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:31,257
English prisoners

193
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,860
Notice I do not say English soldiers

194
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,704
From the moment you surrendered  you ceased to be soldiers

195
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:48,463
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May

196
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:53,744
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer

197
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,898
Time is short  All men will work

198
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:04,062
Your officers will work beside you

199
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,980
This is only just

200
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:10,058
for it is they who betrayed you by surrender

201
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,736
Your shame is their dishonor

202
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:15,379
It is they who told you

203
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:20,019
better to live like a coolie then die like a hero

204
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:23,385
It is they who brought you here  not I

205
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:28,863
Therefore  they will join you in useful labor

206
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,061
That is all

207
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:35,182
Officer prisoners  collect your tools

208
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,862
Bradley  back in your place

209
00:21:43,908 --> 00:21:46,468
I must call your attention  Colonel Saito

210
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:49,262
to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention

211
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,502
"Belligerents may employ prisoners of war

212
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,704
who are fit  other than officers   "

213
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,142
Give me the book

214
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:58,822
By all means  You read English  I take it

215
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,098
Do you read Japanese   I'm sorry  no

216
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:04,465
If it's a matter of translation  I'm sure it can be arranged

217
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:06,579
You see  the Code states that

218
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:10,668
Stand fast in the ranks

219
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:13,618
You speak to me of Code

220
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:16,261
What "Code"

221
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,584
The coward's code

222
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:22,183
What do you know of the soldier's code

223
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:25,465
Of bushido  Nothing

224
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,063
You are unworthy of command

225
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:43,385
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world

226
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:47,098
we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you

227
00:22:47,348 --> 00:22:50,465
My officers will not do manual labor

228
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:52,341
We shall see

229
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:59,062
All enlisted prisoners to work

230
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:12,260
Sergeant Major Take the men to work

231
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:16,062
Battalion  take up tools

232
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:22,866
Move to the left in columnar route  Left turn

233
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:27,660
"A" Company  by the right  quick march

234
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:31,181
Eyes right

235
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:34,058
Eyes right

236
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:43,259
Eyes front

237
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:54,857
Quick march  eyes right

238
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:08,264
"C" Company  by the right

239
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:10,226
What's he up to

240
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,467
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses

241
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:33,581
Now  you will be reasonable

242
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:36,903
You will order your officers to work

243
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:38,342
No

244
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,259
I will count three

245
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:12,379
If by the third count

246
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:16,860
you and your officers are not on the way to work

247
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:19,662
I will give the order to fire

248
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:30,861
He's going to do it

249
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:33,778
Believe me  he's really going to do it

250
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,902
One

251
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,627
I warn you  Colonel

252
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,261
Two

253
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,501
Stop

254
00:25:57,508 --> 00:26:00,068
Colonel Saito  I've seen and heard everything

255
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,099
So has every man in the hospital

256
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:03,667
They're too many witnesses

257
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:07,742
You can't call it a mass escape  Most of those men can't walk

258
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:13,823
Is this your soldier's code  Murdering unarmed men

259
00:27:22,828 --> 00:27:26,867
You see  Jennings  there are advantages to being on the sick list

260
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:29,906
I'll say this for the old man  He's got guts

261
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,298
"Into the valley of death rode the 600 "

262
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:33,867
How's that  sir

263
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:35,987
That kind of guts

264
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:37,900
Also the kind they had in 1914

265
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,708
when officers fought with only a swagger stick

266
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:44,065
I see what you mean   You don't see what I mean at all

267
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:47,067
The kind of guts that can get us all killed

268
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:29,657
Excuse me  sir  I'd like to go along too

269
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:33,666
Arm's almost healed  sir  really it is

270
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,861
What about him

271
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:39,381
He didn't order us not to escape  he suggested

272
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:44,258
Listen  when a man like your colonel suggests something  it's an order

273
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,827
Here we go again

274
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,863
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut

275
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:01,861
Tell them to go

276
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,186
Not you

277
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:25,742
Come

278
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,620
Leave him alone

279
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:50,986
Leave him alone

280
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:43,663
They're going to put him in the oven

281
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:08,663
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

282
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:13,223
For he's a jolly good fellow

283
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:15,618
And so say all of us

284
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:20,458
And so say all of us And so say all of us

285
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:25,583
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

286
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:29,099
For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,623
And so say all of us

288
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,744
Timber

289
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:44,585
One  two  three  four

290
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:49,623
One  two  three  four

291
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,066
No  no  no

292
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,936
Let go

293
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:58,702
Let go

294
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,387
You wish to see me

295
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,744
I've tried to see you for three days

296
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:51,946
It's about the colonel  He's been shut up in that hut

297
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,904
I could have you shot

298
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:01,586
Those prisoners who tried to escape  they were in your charge

299
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:03,581
I knew nothing about the escape

300
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:06,299
It does not matter

301
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:09,306
One must respect those who tried

302
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:13,143
For a brief moment  between escape and death

303
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,026
they were soldiers again

304
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:19,946
But it is insane to try and escape

305
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:24,306
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned

306
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:25,947
To what end

307
00:35:26,148 --> 00:35:28,901
It was an escape from reality

308
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:38,506
There is your reality

309
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:43,304
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today

310
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,218
And this shows the position of actual progress

311
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:53,824
Because of your colonel's stubbornness  we are far behind schedule

312
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,023
That is not all

313
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:58,462
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work

314
00:35:58,668 --> 00:36:02,456
Yes  I have seen it  I could have them all shot

315
00:36:02,908 --> 00:36:05,217
Then who would build your bridge

316
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:07,345
Besides  are you sure it's sabotage

317
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:10,500
The men don't work well without their own officers

318
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:15,344
My officers will direct them  Your officers will work beside them

319
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,380
That's for Nicholson to decide

320
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,300
As he said  it's against the rules

321
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:21,544
Do not speak to me of rules

322
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,506
This is war

323
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:25,705
This is not a game of cricket

324
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,104
He's mad  your colonel

325
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:35,306
quite mad

326
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,096
Sit down  please

327
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,178
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel

328
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:49,822
Thank you

329
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:54,342
Tell him that if his officers will not work

330
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,421
I'll be forced to close the hospital

331
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:00,899
and your patients will work in their place

332
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:05,300
Many will die  and he will be responsible

333
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:09,827
Go and speak to him  You have five minutes

334
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:40,183
Doc's going to see the old man

335
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,102
Sir

336
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,707
It's Clipton  sir

337
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:54,500
I brought you a few things

338
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:02,062
How are the men   Fine  sir  fine

339
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:06,301
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut

340
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:10,781
And the officers

341
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:13,542
Not so good  They're still in detention

342
00:38:13,788 --> 00:38:17,906
And Lieutenant Jennings    Jennings is dead

343
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:20,544
What   Killed  attempting to escape

344
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:24,098
Also two others  Corporal Weaver and the American

345
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:28,624
Jennings  Poor  brave lad

346
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,938
I warned him  didn't I  Clipton

347
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:33,907
Look  sir  we haven't much time

348
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:40,422
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk

349
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,704
I've got something to tell you

350
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:45,303
I've just had a word with Saito

351
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:49,064
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across

352
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:52,226
Actually  I think he's mad  Carry on

353
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:09,936
Blackmail

354
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:14,625
I know  sir  but he means it  I'm sure he does

355
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:18,338
It's a question of face  pure and simple  And he can't give in

356
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:20,818
It's still blackmail

357
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:27,300
Sir  you can't stand much more of this

358
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:32,503
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole

359
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,542
The men are doing a wonderful job  They're going as slow as they dare

360
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:40,706
But Saito's cut their food rations

361
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:42,939
and if he makes the sick men work

362
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:46,817
Well  they're going to die  That's all there is to it

363
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:49,747
Yes  Clipton  I understand  Truly

364
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,422
But don't you see  It's a matter of principle

365
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:56,297
If we give in now  there'll be no end to it  No

366
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:03,501
Sir  we're lost in the jungle  a thousand miles from anywhere

367
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:08,224
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way  Principle

368
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:12,417
No one will ever know or care what happens to us

369
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:15,066
Give in  sir  Please

370
00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:16,707
I'm adamant

371
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,497
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie

372
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:22,340
Time   All right

373
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,907
Please thank those concerned

374
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:30,907
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece

375
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:32,706
Reynolds stole the coconut

376
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:36,902
We'll be able to get you food sometimes

377
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,503
We've bribed one of your guards

378
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:48,985
Goodbye  sir  And good luck

379
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:51,027
Many thanks

380
00:40:58,508 --> 00:41:00,624
Did you say that American was killed

381
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:02,904
Yes  sir  Shot and drowned

382
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,301
It's insane to plan escapes

383
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:11,220
Three men killed  and to what end

384
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:12,662
Time

385
00:41:13,548 --> 00:41:15,823
Here is where we must win through

386
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:39,101
Doc just looked at us and shook his head  Whatever that means

387
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:42,744
Means only one thing  the colonel won't give in

388
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:56,262
Well

389
00:41:56,588 --> 00:41:58,101
It's like this

390
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,908
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force

391
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:03,184
It's a question of principle

392
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,745
As medical officer  I protest the way he's being treated

393
00:42:06,988 --> 00:42:08,865
It's a wonder he's still alive

394
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,902
Should a tragedy occur  it would be tantamount to murder

395
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:17,064
He is responsible

396
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:19,661
Not I

397
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,061
You sick

398
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,658
Are they both mad

399
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:40,059
Or am I going mad

400
00:42:41,988 --> 00:42:43,307
Or is it the sun

401
00:45:38,428 --> 00:45:39,861
Attention

402
00:45:41,068 --> 00:45:43,662
Battalion  attention

403
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:48,464
English prisoners

404
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:51,063
Let us ask the question

405
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:54,345
why does the bridge not progress

406
00:45:54,868 --> 00:45:59,783
You know why  because your officers are lazy

407
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:04,261
They think themselves too good to share your burden

408
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:06,707
This is not just

409
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:09,985
Therefore  you are not happy in your work

410
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:14,018
Therefore  the bridge does not progress

411
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,704
But there is another cause

412
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:19,860
I do not hide the truth

413
00:46:20,468 --> 00:46:22,857
With deep shame and regret

414
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:25,303
I admit to you the failure

415
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:28,267
of a member of the Japanese staff

416
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:30,618
I refer to Lieutenant Miura

417
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:33,179
He is a bad engineer

418
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:35,578
He is unworthy of command

419
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:40,340
Therefore  I have removed him from his post

420
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:45,857
Tomorrow we begin again

421
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:49,459
I shall be in personal command

422
00:46:49,948 --> 00:46:51,939
Today we rest

423
00:46:53,828 --> 00:46:58,265
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy

424
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:02,058
As token of regard for your efforts in the future

425
00:47:02,308 --> 00:47:04,742
I give presents to you all

426
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:18,857
Let us be happy in our work

427
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:22,387
Company  dismissed

428
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:27,064
Battalion  dismissed

429
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:43,177
Hey  take a look at this

430
00:47:43,428 --> 00:47:45,988
Red Cross He's given us our

431
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:49,061
Hey  he's given us our own Red Cross parcels

432
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:52,465
"Tomorrow we begin again "

433
00:48:51,968 --> 00:48:53,321
Hey  Harry  look

434
00:48:54,248 --> 00:48:56,239
They're letting the old man out

435
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:20,760
Most likely going to give him another pasting

436
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:04,681
Good evening  colonel

437
00:50:11,448 --> 00:50:13,359
Do you mind sitting over here

438
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:16,966
I am having rather a late supper

439
00:50:39,128 --> 00:50:41,358
English corned beef

440
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,761
No  thank you

441
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:51,285
Produce of Scotland

442
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,078
I prefer it to sake

443
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:58,122
I spent three years in London  you know

444
00:50:58,568 --> 00:51:01,878
I studied at the London Polytechnic

445
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:04,721
Cheers

446
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:06,481
Sorry

447
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:08,480
Later  perhaps

448
00:51:08,728 --> 00:51:10,286
Perhaps

449
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:17,878
I was not a good artist

450
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:20,318
My father disapproved

451
00:51:20,568 --> 00:51:22,877
He felt I belonged in the army

452
00:51:23,928 --> 00:51:27,477
So I changed from art to engineering

453
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:32,079
I must tell you  Colonel Saito

454
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:35,917
I intend to make a full report of your activities

455
00:51:41,088 --> 00:51:44,683
I do not think you quite realize my position

456
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,319
I must carry out my orders   Oh  quite  quite

457
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:52,322
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 12th day of May

458
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,128
I have only 12 weeks more   No doubt

459
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:59,919
Therefore  I am compelled to use all available personnel

460
00:52:00,168 --> 00:52:02,887
No officers  except for administration

461
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:07,081
But officers are working along the entire railway

462
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:08,886
You know it  I know it

463
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:11,886
I'm not responsible for other officers

464
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,521
Personally  I'm appalled

465
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:16,037
Let's not get excited

466
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:22,887
Will you have a cigar

467
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,999
No  Thank you

468
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:30,284
When I said all officers must work

469
00:52:30,488 --> 00:52:33,798
naturally  I never meant you  the commanding officer

470
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:38,087
My orders were only intended for officers below

471
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,279
No officers will do manual labor

472
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:43,679
Please I was about to say:

473
00:52:43,888 --> 00:52:47,085
I've thought the matter over and have decided

474
00:52:47,328 --> 00:52:51,606
to put majors and above on administrative duties

475
00:52:51,848 --> 00:52:54,487
leaving only junior officers to work

476
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:58,124
No  The Convention's quite clear on that point

477
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:15,719
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time

478
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:17,526
I haven't the foggiest

479
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:20,282
I'd have to kill myself

480
00:53:20,728 --> 00:53:23,288
What would you do if you were me

481
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,282
I suppose if I were you

482
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:29,078
I'd have to kill myself

483
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:32,356
Cheers

484
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:36,002
I warn you  colonel

485
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:40,526
if I am to die  others will die before me

486
00:53:40,768 --> 00:53:41,962
Do you understand

487
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,722
Clipton did mention that

488
00:53:44,928 --> 00:53:47,317
That won't solve your problem

489
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:49,877
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution

490
00:53:50,128 --> 00:53:51,686
Please sit down

491
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:58,078
Now  Tell me  colonel

492
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:01,918
do you agree that the first job of an officer is command

493
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:03,965
Of course   Good

494
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,562
Now

495
00:54:10,048 --> 00:54:11,879
Take this bridge of yours

496
00:54:12,568 --> 00:54:14,684
It's quite an enormous undertaking

497
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:18,881
Frankly  I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's his name

498
00:54:19,128 --> 00:54:20,880
Miura

499
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:25,483
is capable of tackling a job of such importance

500
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:30,880
On the other hand  I have officers  Reeves and Hughes for instance

501
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,678
who have built bridges all over India

502
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:37,281
The men respect them

503
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:41,043
It's essential for an officer to have that respect

504
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:43,318
If it's gone  he ceases to command

505
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:45,877
What then  Demoralization and chaos

506
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:49,484
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen

507
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:54,643
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command

508
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:58,483
Really  And may I ask  are you satisfied with the work

509
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:00,918
I am not  You've proved my point

510
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:03,284
I hate the British

511
00:55:03,488 --> 00:55:06,525
You are defeated but you have no shame

512
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:09,077
You are stubborn but have no pride

513
00:55:09,328 --> 00:55:12,206
You endure but you have no courage

514
00:55:12,448 --> 00:55:14,120
I hate the British

515
00:55:15,168 --> 00:55:16,999
Pointless  going on like this

516
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:18,442
Stay there

517
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:48,684
Stand down  Stand down

518
00:58:57,808 --> 00:59:00,197
Battalion  attention

519
00:59:38,568 --> 00:59:41,207
Battalion  stand at ease

520
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:45,081
Please

521
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:49,081
Do you know what is the date today  colonel

522
00:59:49,528 --> 00:59:50,961
I've lost count

523
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:53,881
It's the anniversary of our great victory

524
00:59:54,088 --> 00:59:56,727
over Russia in 1905

525
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,927
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date

526
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:02,920
In honor of this occasion

527
01:00:03,168 --> 01:00:05,762
I have given your troops a day of rest

528
01:00:06,008 --> 01:00:07,202
Many thanks

529
01:00:07,448 --> 01:00:10,326
I am declaring a general amnesty

530
01:00:10,568 --> 01:00:13,924
You and your officers may return to your quarters

531
01:00:14,168 --> 01:00:16,318
As part of this amnesty

532
01:00:16,688 --> 01:00:21,603
it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labor

533
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:51,802
He's done it

534
01:03:08,968 --> 01:03:11,118
Somebody deserves a medal  sir

535
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:24,160
How many men in your party

536
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:26,285
I don't really know  sir

537
01:03:26,528 --> 01:03:28,564
You don't know   Twelve  usually

538
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:31,959
One of the men took sick this morning  sir

539
01:03:32,168 --> 01:03:35,399
It took three or four to help him to the hospital

540
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:40,518
And    He took terrible sick  sir

541
01:03:40,808 --> 01:03:44,323
A corporal should know how many men he has under him

542
01:03:44,808 --> 01:03:46,719
Oh  yes  sir

543
01:03:47,608 --> 01:03:51,123
Have you a nervous affliction  Stop making those faces

544
01:03:52,688 --> 01:03:56,761
It may be funny to you  but it's not military behavior

545
01:03:57,008 --> 01:03:58,123
No  sir

546
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:04,328
We must put a stop to these demonstrations

547
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,117
I say  Reeves   Yes  sir

548
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:19,718
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai

549
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:23,364
Yes  sir  half a dozen of them in Madras  Bengal

550
01:04:23,608 --> 01:04:25,519
If this were your bridge

551
01:04:26,288 --> 01:04:28,324
how would you get it under way

552
01:04:30,288 --> 01:04:31,960
Get it under way  sir

553
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,722
First of all  I wouldn't build it here

554
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:37,038
Oh  why not

555
01:04:37,288 --> 01:04:38,767
I was trying to tell you

556
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,717
the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location

557
01:04:43,408 --> 01:04:45,319
You see those piles

558
01:04:45,568 --> 01:04:47,126
They're sinking

559
01:04:49,408 --> 01:04:53,117
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold

560
01:04:53,408 --> 01:04:55,319
Where would you build it

561
01:04:56,408 --> 01:04:59,366
Further downstream  sir  Across those narrows

562
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:02,327
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks

563
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:07,120
Hughes  if this were your bridge  how would you use the men

564
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:11,441
Not the way they're doing it  It's chaos  as you can see

565
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:15,324
Uncoordinated activity

566
01:05:15,568 --> 01:05:17,126
No teamwork

567
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:21,725
Some parties are working against each other

568
01:05:23,928 --> 01:05:25,122
Yes

569
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:31,525
I say  gentlemen  we have a problem on our hands

570
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:34,362
Thanks to the Japanese  we command a rabble

571
01:05:34,608 --> 01:05:36,917
There's no order  no discipline

572
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:41,166
Our task is to rebuild the battalion   Yes  sir

573
01:05:41,408 --> 01:05:43,160
Which isn't going to be easy

574
01:05:43,408 --> 01:05:46,764
Fortunately  we have the means at hand  The bridge

575
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:49,317
The bridge  sir   The bridge

576
01:05:51,608 --> 01:05:56,124
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame

577
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:58,922
Show what a British soldier is capable of

578
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,728
Yes  I see your point  sir

579
01:06:01,928 --> 01:06:04,567
I know how difficult it's going to be here

580
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:07,163
where you can't find what you need

581
01:06:07,408 --> 01:06:10,320
There's the challenge   I beg your pardon  sir

582
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:12,957
You really want them to build the bridge

583
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,722
You're not usually so slow in the uptake

584
01:06:15,928 --> 01:06:18,761
I know our men  You've got to keep them occupied

585
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:21,920
If there weren't any work  we'd invent some

586
01:06:22,168 --> 01:06:24,921
That we would  sir   So we're lucky

587
01:06:25,168 --> 01:06:27,557
But it's going to be a proper bridge

588
01:06:27,808 --> 01:06:29,844
Here again I know the men

589
01:06:30,088 --> 01:06:32,966
It's essential that they take pride in their job

590
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,721
Right  men   Yes  sir

591
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:37,726
Reeves  you're the key man here as engineer

592
01:06:37,968 --> 01:06:41,722
Tell me what you want and we'll get it  Can we make a go of it

593
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:44,123
We'll do out best  sir   Fine

594
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:47,517
We must draw up our plans

595
01:06:48,128 --> 01:06:50,722
then arrange a conference with Saito

596
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:53,319
and set him straight

597
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:59,119
That takes care of all the procedural matters

598
01:07:00,168 --> 01:07:01,521
Oh  yes

599
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:05,748
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned  I'm afraid

600
01:07:06,008 --> 01:07:09,523
Sorry to say  the position of the bridge was fixed hastily

601
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:11,923
and  I have to add  incorrectly

602
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:15,637
Incorrectly

603
01:07:15,888 --> 01:07:17,321
Unfortunately  yes

604
01:07:17,568 --> 01:07:20,162
Our engineer has made a study of the site

605
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:23,605
and decided that the river bottom there is too soft

606
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:25,602
Too soft

607
01:07:25,848 --> 01:07:28,203
Mud All the work has been useless

608
01:07:28,448 --> 01:07:31,308
Reeves  will you carry on   Yes  sir

609
01:07:31,608 --> 01:07:36,523
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold

610
01:07:36,808 --> 01:07:39,447
It would collapse under the first train

611
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,761
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch

612
01:07:43,968 --> 01:07:48,883
Reeves  before you get too involved    Colonel  could we have a cup of tea

613
01:08:01,568 --> 01:08:05,356
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster

614
01:08:05,608 --> 01:08:10,523
we build a new bridge  at the site picked by Reeves  400 yards downstream

615
01:08:13,968 --> 01:08:16,128
Let's proceed to the next point

616
01:08:16,928 --> 01:08:19,522
I decided to alter the work quota of our men

617
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,366
Alter   I've increased it

618
01:08:21,608 --> 01:08:24,042
From 1 5 yards of earth moved to two

619
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:26,927
I'm sure it will meet with your approval

620
01:08:27,128 --> 01:08:30,325
Hughes has all the facts  Would you take over

621
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:33,441
I've done a time study of the entire project

622
01:08:33,688 --> 01:08:37,363
You see  the available forces have been badly distributed

623
01:08:37,608 --> 01:08:41,157
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties

624
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:46,323
Just a moment  Colonel  it would save time if we could work during dinner

625
01:08:46,568 --> 01:08:48,923
Would it be possible to have dinner

626
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:50,317
Of course

627
01:08:53,728 --> 01:08:55,127
Carry on   Yes  sir

628
01:08:55,328 --> 01:08:59,037
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions

629
01:08:59,288 --> 01:09:03,440
I'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30%

630
01:09:03,688 --> 01:09:06,725
Now  Colonel Saito  I have one more point

631
01:09:07,528 --> 01:09:12,318
Now  there's another important decision that can't be postponed

632
01:09:12,568 --> 01:09:14,718
As the British will work on the bridge

633
01:09:14,968 --> 01:09:17,766
only a few will be available for railway work

634
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:22,718
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang

635
01:09:22,928 --> 01:09:27,319
so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible

636
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:30,723
I have already given the order

637
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:33,926
We must fix the daily work quota for your men

638
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:37,916
I thought to set it at 1 5 yards so as not to overtire them

639
01:09:38,168 --> 01:09:40,762
but isn't it best to be the same as ours

640
01:09:41,008 --> 01:09:44,125
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit

641
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:49,085
I have already given the order

642
01:09:49,328 --> 01:09:51,762
We'll try to surpass that  won't we  Hughes

643
01:09:52,008 --> 01:09:54,841
I think that completes the agenda for tonight

644
01:09:55,088 --> 01:09:58,364
Thank you  Colonel Saito  for your kind attention

645
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,361
Are there any other questions

646
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:04,326
One question

647
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:07,363
Can you finish the bridge in time

648
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:10,964
Frankly  the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible

649
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,517
But we'll certainly give it a go

650
01:10:14,728 --> 01:10:18,846
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement

651
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:20,840
for which I was not to blame

652
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:24,126
Is there anything else

653
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:25,923
No

654
01:10:26,528 --> 01:10:30,316
Thank you  The meeting is closed

655
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:33,922
Good night   Good night

656
01:10:57,168 --> 01:11:01,320
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them

657
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:05,125
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation

658
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:08,527
Good night  Clipton   Good night  sir

659
01:11:10,568 --> 01:11:12,559
By the way  I meant to tell you

660
01:11:12,808 --> 01:11:15,527
there are trees here similar to elm

661
01:11:15,728 --> 01:11:19,516
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years

662
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:22,726
Six hundred years  Reeves   Yes  sir

663
01:11:23,768 --> 01:11:25,918
Six hundred years

664
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:28,524
That would be quite something

665
01:12:15,608 --> 01:12:19,157
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears

666
01:12:19,408 --> 01:12:22,525
Yes  down on the beach   Oh  thank you very much

667
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:31,122
Kiss

668
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,708
Too many eyes

669
01:12:34,008 --> 01:12:37,921
You give me powders  pills  baths  injections  enemas

670
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:39,561
All I need is love

671
01:12:39,808 --> 01:12:42,527
It's true  All you really need is love

672
01:12:47,128 --> 01:12:50,120
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge

673
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:52,563
Because I'm a civilian at heart  lover

674
01:12:52,808 --> 01:12:54,844
And I always follow my heart

675
01:12:55,088 --> 01:12:56,316
Kiss

676
01:13:04,528 --> 01:13:06,519
How's that  commander

677
01:13:07,528 --> 01:13:09,120
Don't call me commander

678
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:10,647
It's unromantic

679
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:12,526
You're an officer yourself

680
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:15,561
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover

681
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,163
Let's be democratic  Just call me "sir "

682
01:13:18,368 --> 01:13:19,437
Yes  sir

683
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:22,641
Brass ahoy

684
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:25,120
He wants you  He's all yours

685
01:13:25,328 --> 01:13:27,717
I'm going for a swim   Don't leave me

686
01:13:29,328 --> 01:13:30,761
Commander Shears   Yes

687
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:32,726
My name's Warden

688
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:34,646
How do you do   Sorry to intrude

689
01:13:34,888 --> 01:13:37,243
That's okay  major  I'm used to it

690
01:13:37,448 --> 01:13:38,437
Like a martini

691
01:13:38,688 --> 01:13:40,360
That's very kind  I think not

692
01:13:40,608 --> 01:13:41,723
Mind if I have one

693
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:43,242
How did you get that

694
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:46,719
Where there's a hospital  there's alcohol

695
01:13:46,968 --> 01:13:49,323
Yes  of course  Jolly good

696
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:52,117
Well  I'll be as brief as possible

697
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:55,758
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 316

698
01:13:56,008 --> 01:13:58,363
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens

699
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:01,725
Protecting rare plants from the enemy   Not quite

700
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:04,717
Sure you won't have one   No  thanks

701
01:14:04,928 --> 01:14:08,716
We have an interest in that railway you worked on

702
01:14:08,968 --> 01:14:12,119
You could give us no end of valuable information

703
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:15,718
Well  I'm leaving for the States in a few days

704
01:14:15,928 --> 01:14:18,920
and I told your people everything I know

705
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:22,365
But you could help us in a rather special sense

706
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:27,523
I know it's a terrible imposition  but could you possibly come out and see us

707
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:31,766
If you want to go over the whole thing again

708
01:14:32,008 --> 01:14:34,568
Very kind  Lord Louis'll be grateful

709
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:35,957
Who   Mountbatten

710
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:38,722
We're one of his special pigeons

711
01:14:38,928 --> 01:14:42,523
Shall we say this evening  then  About 8  I'll send a car

712
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,719
This evening  Out of the question

713
01:14:44,968 --> 01:14:47,118
Tomorrow morning then  About 10

714
01:14:47,408 --> 01:14:49,763
Okay  10:00   Thanks very much

715
01:14:50,008 --> 01:14:52,124
Cheerio   Cheerio

716
01:14:52,328 --> 01:14:53,522
Good luck

717
01:14:54,408 --> 01:14:55,523
Thanks

718
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:06,917
You're sorry  but you're going to stand me up tonight

719
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,119
You couldn't be more wrong

720
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:15,848
General salute

721
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:17,760
Present arms

722
01:15:31,008 --> 01:15:33,727
May I see your pass  please   Oh  yes

723
01:15:45,968 --> 01:15:48,926
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path

724
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:03,519
Good show  Jenkins  Good show

725
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:07,125
Come along  Thomson  Use your knife  man

726
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:12,328
On your feet Away to the debriefing room

727
01:16:12,528 --> 01:16:14,917
Come on  move yourselves Move quickly

728
01:16:17,768 --> 01:16:21,317
Very clumsy  Joyce  very clumsy

729
01:16:22,528 --> 01:16:25,361
Always use your knife immediately  Joyce

730
01:16:25,608 --> 01:16:28,122
You see  he's gained the initiative

731
01:16:28,328 --> 01:16:31,957
Wait a minute I'm terribly sorry  sir

732
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,324
You're sorry   So am I

733
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:37,719
I thought you were the enemy   I'm American  if that's what you mean

734
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:41,722
That'll be all  Joyce   Yes  sir  Sorry  sir

735
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:45,925
What can I do for you   I'm going to see Major Warden

736
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:50,348
I'll show you the way  He'll finish his lecture any moment now

737
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:59,325
That's the end of his lecture   Thunderous ovation

738
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:03,528
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible

739
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,918
Major Warden  sir   Yes

740
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:09,527
Good of you to come

741
01:17:09,768 --> 01:17:12,362
They took care of you   They certainly have

742
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:15,566
Thank you  staff  Well  come along  then

743
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:18,527
Col  Green is looking forward to meeting you

744
01:17:19,888 --> 01:17:24,803
Fascinating place  isn't it   Didn't know it was a commando school

745
01:17:25,128 --> 01:17:29,724
We're trying to discourage the use of that word  Such a melodramatic air

746
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:31,322
What do you do here

747
01:17:31,528 --> 01:17:33,837
Sabotage  demolition  that line of country

748
01:17:34,088 --> 01:17:36,966
We're using P E   plastic explosives  It's wonderful

749
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,722
That pop was made with a lump half this size

750
01:17:39,968 --> 01:17:43,278
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight

751
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:47,321
It's quite harmless until it's detonated

752
01:17:47,688 --> 01:17:49,121
Thanks for telling me

753
01:17:49,328 --> 01:17:52,638
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic

754
01:17:52,848 --> 01:17:55,123
You can do what you like with it

755
01:17:55,968 --> 01:17:57,526
This is my place

756
01:18:02,768 --> 01:18:04,121
Go ahead

757
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:10,144
Oh  I'm dying for a cup of tea

758
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:13,615
Would you care for one   No  thanks

759
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:15,941
A drink   No  thank you

760
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:19,143
Pot of tea for one  please  Peter   Very good  sir

761
01:18:22,905 --> 01:18:24,179
Do you read this

762
01:18:24,425 --> 01:18:28,134
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war

763
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:35,341
I never congratulated you on your escape  Good show

764
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:39,254
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me  I wouldn't be here

765
01:18:39,505 --> 01:18:41,143
No  I suppose not

766
01:18:44,225 --> 01:18:46,739
Would you like to see where you were

767
01:18:47,665 --> 01:18:48,541
All right

768
01:18:50,185 --> 01:18:53,575
Our information's scanty  It's based on your report

769
01:18:53,825 --> 01:18:55,543
We think the camp's here

770
01:18:55,785 --> 01:18:59,425
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col  Nicholson

771
01:18:59,705 --> 01:19:03,584
He had guts  They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye

772
01:19:03,825 --> 01:19:06,862
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do

773
01:19:07,105 --> 01:19:11,425
Here is the river Kwai  and here's the village where you were helped

774
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,138
Here is the railway

775
01:19:13,345 --> 01:19:15,939
You must be fairly familiar with this area

776
01:19:16,145 --> 01:19:18,579
No  I was out of my head half the time

777
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:22,261
The railway starts down here in Singapore  Malaya

778
01:19:22,505 --> 01:19:27,181
Bangkok  Rangoon  Their idea is to drive on through  into India

779
01:19:27,425 --> 01:19:30,735
Where was I picked up   Oh  about here

780
01:19:30,985 --> 01:19:35,740
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok Rangoon section by the middle of May

781
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:38,025
We'll try to prevent them

782
01:19:38,225 --> 01:19:40,944
It's too far for bombers to carry a load

783
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:43,375
We'll have to go smash it on the ground

784
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:46,139
How   Parachute drop  then march

785
01:19:46,345 --> 01:19:49,143
With demolition equipment through that jungle

786
01:19:49,745 --> 01:19:53,579
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge

787
01:19:53,825 --> 01:19:56,259
You see  none of us have ever been there

788
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:59,577
I don't want to discourage     It should be interesting

789
01:19:59,825 --> 01:20:04,535
Col  Green's given me the Kwai bridge  I'm taking a team in to blow it up

790
01:20:05,225 --> 01:20:06,738
Lucky you

791
01:20:09,345 --> 01:20:10,744
Sure you won't have tea

792
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:15,336
No  thanks  I don't want to be rude  but I've got a date at 2

793
01:20:15,585 --> 01:20:19,134
If there are any questions     Of course  I'm sorry

794
01:20:21,785 --> 01:20:24,743
Well  there is only one question  actually

795
01:20:25,145 --> 01:20:27,340
How would you feel about going back

796
01:20:29,585 --> 01:20:30,495
Come again

797
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:34,219
Under the circumstances it's a bit much

798
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:37,462
but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose

799
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:39,423
We'd love to have you with us

800
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,575
That's why you brought me here

801
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:45,258
To ask me this

802
01:20:45,505 --> 01:20:47,143
Well  frankly  yes

803
01:20:47,345 --> 01:20:48,983
I just got out of there

804
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:53,138
My escape was a miracle  Now you want me to go back Ridiculous

805
01:20:53,345 --> 01:20:54,573
This is embarrassing

806
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:58,340
I don't belong to you  I belong to the American Navy

807
01:20:58,585 --> 01:21:02,339
Actually  Col  Green has taken the matter up with your people

808
01:21:02,545 --> 01:21:06,220
With my people   Your Navy's turned you over to us

809
01:21:06,705 --> 01:21:10,061
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific

810
01:21:10,305 --> 01:21:14,184
authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 316

811
01:21:14,425 --> 01:21:17,098
They can't do this  I'm afraid they have

812
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:19,975
It was hard to break it to you

813
01:21:20,225 --> 01:21:24,537
But they can't do this to me  I mean it  My Navy's made a mistake

814
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:32,185
Look  I'm not a Navy commander  I'm not even an officer

815
01:21:32,425 --> 01:21:37,340
The whole thing's a fake  I'm just an ordinary swab jockey  second class

816
01:21:39,825 --> 01:21:43,659
When the Houston sunk  I made it ashore with a real commander

817
01:21:43,905 --> 01:21:46,942
We ran into a Japanese patrol  He was killed

818
01:21:47,145 --> 01:21:50,342
I figured it was just a matter of time till I

819
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:53,305
So you changed uniforms with a dead man

820
01:21:53,745 --> 01:21:57,340
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps

821
01:21:57,585 --> 01:22:01,021
But with Saito  the officers worked along with the rest

822
01:22:01,265 --> 01:22:03,699
There's always the unexpected  isn't there

823
01:22:05,745 --> 01:22:08,976
I kind of got used to being a commander

824
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:11,375
so when I arrived at the hospital

825
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:16,540
I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward

826
01:22:16,785 --> 01:22:21,176
and I said to myself  "Let's let it ride along for a while "

827
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:23,063
There were certain advantages

828
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,057
I saw one of them on the beach

829
01:22:25,945 --> 01:22:27,378
That's the whole story

830
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:31,379
The point is  you can't use me  You want an officer

831
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,378
an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist

832
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,980
When the Navy learns the truth  they'll say:

833
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,904
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer "

834
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,537
Once that happens  I've got it made   Got it what

835
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:46,140
Made I'd like that drink now

836
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:49,495
I'll apply for a medical discharge

837
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:54,455
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle

838
01:22:55,865 --> 01:22:59,540
I'm getting worse  Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey

839
01:23:00,265 --> 01:23:01,903
It's quite a clever plan

840
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:05,095
Not only clever  it's foolproof

841
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:07,575
If my Navy finds out who I am

842
01:23:07,825 --> 01:23:11,659
those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on

843
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:26,622
Isn't this your photograph

844
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:32,104
Where did you get this   It took some doing

845
01:23:32,345 --> 01:23:34,654
since your people couldn't identify you

846
01:23:34,945 --> 01:23:39,496
Finally your C in C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record

847
01:23:39,745 --> 01:23:43,579
The photograph  fingerprints  Would you care to have a look

848
01:23:45,585 --> 01:23:49,658
You see  we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week

849
01:23:52,465 --> 01:23:54,899
Your Navy's in an awkward position

850
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:57,225
In one sense you're a hero

851
01:23:57,505 --> 01:24:00,065
for making an escape from the jungle

852
01:24:00,265 --> 01:24:03,098
At the same time  they can't bring you home

853
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:06,661
and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer

854
01:24:06,865 --> 01:24:10,096
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over

855
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,858
You see

856
01:24:12,065 --> 01:24:13,134
Hot potato

857
01:24:14,145 --> 01:24:16,261
As far as your rank is concerned

858
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,502
we're fairly informal about that in Force 316

859
01:24:19,745 --> 01:24:22,020
You'd have the simulated rank of major

860
01:24:23,345 --> 01:24:26,860
A simulated major  That figures

861
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:29,664
Well

862
01:24:33,185 --> 01:24:36,025
As long as I'm hooked  I might as well volunteer

863
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:38,139
Good show

864
01:24:39,545 --> 01:24:41,183
Oh  Colonel Green  sir

865
01:24:41,425 --> 01:24:46,340
This is Major Shears  He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge

866
01:24:46,745 --> 01:24:48,064
Really

867
01:24:49,105 --> 01:24:50,697
Good show

868
01:24:50,945 --> 01:24:53,664
Jolly good show  major

869
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:43,738
Get up to sick bay  This foot's infected

870
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:45,976
Colonel might think I'm malingering

871
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:48,864
I'm the medical officer  Get cracking

872
01:25:54,425 --> 01:25:58,054
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge

873
01:25:58,305 --> 01:26:01,661
Don't worry about old Nick  He knows what he's doing

874
01:26:11,665 --> 01:26:15,658
Hello  Clipton  About time you paid us a visit

875
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:18,381
Fine job our chaps are doing

876
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,855
Yes  How's he behaving

877
01:26:21,105 --> 01:26:23,699
He's been most reasonable since we took over

878
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:26,698
What's he thinking   I haven't the foggiest

879
01:26:26,945 --> 01:26:28,856
Thanks  Reeves   Right  sir

880
01:26:29,545 --> 01:26:30,864
What do you think

881
01:26:32,505 --> 01:26:34,257
Quite a challenge  isn't it

882
01:26:36,345 --> 01:26:40,497
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea

883
01:26:40,745 --> 01:26:42,258
Are you serious   Yes  sir

884
01:26:42,505 --> 01:26:46,054
A good idea  Take another look

885
01:26:46,945 --> 01:26:50,699
You don't agree morale is high  Discipline has been restored

886
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:52,901
Their condition has improved

887
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:55,579
Are they a happier lot or aren't they

888
01:26:55,825 --> 01:26:59,056
They feed better and they are no longer abused

889
01:26:59,305 --> 01:27:03,298
Honestly  Clipton  there are times when I don't understand you at all

890
01:27:03,545 --> 01:27:05,376
I'll try to make myself clear

891
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:09,334
The fact is  what we're doing could be construed as

892
01:27:09,545 --> 01:27:12,457
forgive me  sir  collaboration with the enemy

893
01:27:12,705 --> 01:27:14,263
Perhaps even treason

894
01:27:14,465 --> 01:27:18,378
We're prisoners of war  We haven't the right to refuse to work

895
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:21,745
I understand that  sir  But must we work so well

896
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,857
Must we do better than they could themselves

897
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:30,063
If you had to operate on Saito  would you do your best or let him die

898
01:27:31,025 --> 01:27:33,698
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness

899
01:27:33,945 --> 01:27:36,664
Or have it said we can't do a proper job

900
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:41,655
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit

901
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:44,061
Take a good look  Clipton

902
01:27:44,865 --> 01:27:46,856
One day the war will be over

903
01:27:47,065 --> 01:27:50,182
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come

904
01:27:50,425 --> 01:27:53,497
will remember how it was built  and who built it

905
01:27:53,745 --> 01:27:58,660
Not a gang of slaves  but soldiers  British soldiers  even in captivity

906
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,295
Yes  sir   You're a fine doctor

907
01:28:01,545 --> 01:28:04,264
but you've a lot to learn about the army

908
01:28:27,025 --> 01:28:28,504
Hold him Hold him

909
01:28:28,745 --> 01:28:32,658
Use your boot Get your boot in there  will you

910
01:28:39,665 --> 01:28:41,064
Good morning

911
01:28:54,225 --> 01:28:57,058
What on earth are you people staring at

912
01:28:59,905 --> 01:29:01,657
Get him with your boot

913
01:29:13,745 --> 01:29:15,178
I'm sorry I'm late  sir

914
01:29:15,425 --> 01:29:19,100
Four minutes  to be exact  You were in need of medical attention

915
01:29:19,345 --> 01:29:21,859
Sir   I was referring to the nurse

916
01:29:22,785 --> 01:29:25,299
Very ingenious  Warden was right

917
01:29:25,545 --> 01:29:26,864
Sit down

918
01:29:27,545 --> 01:29:31,697
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team

919
01:29:31,945 --> 01:29:34,505
Ask Mr  Joyce to come in   Yes  sir

920
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:37,784
Chapman wants Joyce  but I have my doubts

921
01:29:38,025 --> 01:29:41,654
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation

922
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:42,894
I've told you

923
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:47,377
in this job  even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do

924
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,900
He's the best swimmer in the school

925
01:29:50,145 --> 01:29:54,263
I'm well aware of your evaluation  The opinion I want is Shears'

926
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,456
All right  at ease

927
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:07,535
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle

928
01:30:07,785 --> 01:30:09,059
Yes  sir

929
01:30:09,705 --> 01:30:11,855
You were an accountant in Montreal

930
01:30:12,105 --> 01:30:14,175
Yes  sir  Not really an accountant

931
01:30:14,425 --> 01:30:16,461
That is  I didn't have my charter

932
01:30:16,665 --> 01:30:18,018
Exactly what did you do

933
01:30:18,265 --> 01:30:22,053
Well  sir  I just checked columns and columns of figures

934
01:30:22,305 --> 01:30:24,660
which people had checked before me

935
01:30:24,865 --> 01:30:28,175
and other people checked them after I had checked them

936
01:30:28,425 --> 01:30:31,497
Sounds a frightful bore   Sir  it was a bore

937
01:30:31,745 --> 01:30:33,258
How did you wind up here

938
01:30:33,465 --> 01:30:38,380
In '39 I came over to London to enlist  Later I volunteered for this work

939
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:42,220
You volunteered  Yes  sir  See  the regular Army

940
01:30:42,465 --> 01:30:44,023
Go ahead  you can be frank

941
01:30:44,425 --> 01:30:49,294
Well  the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life

942
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,661
They don't expect you to think

943
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,457
Think about this

944
01:30:55,745 --> 01:30:58,578
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood

945
01:30:59,025 --> 01:31:00,253
I know how to use it

946
01:31:00,505 --> 01:31:04,339
That's not what I meant  Could you use it in cold blood

947
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:06,860
Could you kill without hesitation

948
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:12,780
That's a question I've asked myself  It's worried me quite a bit

949
01:31:13,225 --> 01:31:14,863
And what was the answer

950
01:31:15,265 --> 01:31:17,256
I don't honestly know  sir

951
01:31:17,945 --> 01:31:20,459
I've tried to imagine myself

952
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:26,059
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime

953
01:31:26,745 --> 01:31:28,622
It's an old army problem

954
01:31:29,225 --> 01:31:32,262
Well  I think that's all  Thank you  Joyce

955
01:31:34,745 --> 01:31:36,144
Am I to go with the team

956
01:31:37,585 --> 01:31:38,813
We'll let you know

957
01:31:46,145 --> 01:31:47,260
You see what I mean

958
01:31:47,465 --> 01:31:49,296
Well  at least he was honest

959
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:53,857
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises

960
01:31:54,265 --> 01:31:56,256
What's your opinion  Shears

961
01:31:56,865 --> 01:31:58,378
Well  he's Canadian

962
01:31:58,585 --> 01:32:02,464
That fits with the international composition of this outfit

963
01:32:02,945 --> 01:32:05,175
If he wants to go  he can take my place

964
01:32:05,945 --> 01:32:09,301
Well  if you're all agreed on Joyce  he's yours

965
01:32:09,985 --> 01:32:12,897
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village

966
01:32:13,145 --> 01:32:15,978
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk

967
01:32:16,225 --> 01:32:19,297
You've had parachute training   No  sir

968
01:32:19,505 --> 01:32:22,099
Blast This is awkward

969
01:32:22,345 --> 01:32:24,461
Silly  it never occurred to me

970
01:32:24,985 --> 01:32:26,020
Well  maybe

971
01:32:26,265 --> 01:32:29,063
He's right  Arrange some practice jumps for him

972
01:32:29,305 --> 01:32:31,102
I'll go check right away

973
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:34,257
All right  Chapman  you can run along   Yes  sir

974
01:32:36,505 --> 01:32:38,700
Well  feel like a sniff of air

975
01:32:38,945 --> 01:32:40,264
Yes  sir

976
01:32:40,505 --> 01:32:43,065
You don't realize what a plum you are

977
01:32:43,305 --> 01:32:46,661
Your knowledge of the area  making friends in that village

978
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:50,858
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind

979
01:32:53,545 --> 01:32:57,857
By the way  here's something that'll interest you  The new "L" pill

980
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:02,255
L pill   L for lethal  Instant  painless

981
01:33:02,465 --> 01:33:05,662
Much better than the old ones  For capture  of course

982
01:33:05,865 --> 01:33:08,299
You're telling me not to be taken alive

983
01:33:08,545 --> 01:33:10,263
I wouldn't recommend it

984
01:33:10,745 --> 01:33:14,784
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind

985
01:33:15,025 --> 01:33:17,255
The objective comes first in our work

986
01:33:17,905 --> 01:33:22,296
You want my honest evaluation  I didn't want to say in front of them

987
01:33:22,545 --> 01:33:24,263
I understand  go ahead

988
01:33:25,665 --> 01:33:28,782
Well  Chapman will be fine  Ice water in his veins

989
01:33:29,025 --> 01:33:31,664
Joyce is    He'll be okay

990
01:33:31,905 --> 01:33:34,465
It's Warden I don't get   Oh  Why not

991
01:33:34,665 --> 01:33:36,337
Cambridge don and all of that

992
01:33:36,545 --> 01:33:39,981
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers

993
01:33:40,225 --> 01:33:42,455
He's not without experience  you know

994
01:33:43,305 --> 01:33:47,093
When Singapore fell  he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges

995
01:33:47,345 --> 01:33:50,462
Many other installations before the Japs caught him

996
01:33:50,705 --> 01:33:54,061
Fascinating story  He     Sir  it's most annoying

997
01:33:54,305 --> 01:33:58,696
In view of time  they don't think practice jumps would be worth it

998
01:33:58,945 --> 01:34:02,699
If you make one jump there's only a 50% chance of injury

999
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:06,381
Two jumps  80%  Three jumps  you're bound to get your packet

1000
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:10,379
The consensus is  the most sensible thing for Shears to do

1001
01:34:10,585 --> 01:34:13,463
is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best

1002
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:15,661
With or without parachute

1003
01:34:20,545 --> 01:34:22,661
Oh  very good

1004
01:34:26,105 --> 01:34:27,663
With or without

1005
01:35:22,505 --> 01:35:23,494
He's in the trees

1006
01:36:00,905 --> 01:36:03,465
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way

1007
01:36:03,665 --> 01:36:07,905
There are too many Japanese patrols  We'll swing north through heavy jungle

1008
01:36:08,145 --> 01:36:10,101
Then who's going to lead   Yai

1009
01:36:10,345 --> 01:36:12,779
He hates the Japanese  They took all his men

1010
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:15,664
Which means we shall have to use women bearers

1011
01:36:15,905 --> 01:36:17,975
Women bearers  They're capable

1012
01:36:29,305 --> 01:36:32,263
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here

1013
01:36:32,505 --> 01:36:36,498
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle

1014
01:36:36,745 --> 01:36:41,261
What about Chapman   Yai will bury him and his chute

1015
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:43,063
Is there something wrong

1016
01:36:44,145 --> 01:36:48,696
I was just thinking  You speak Yai's language  I don't

1017
01:36:48,945 --> 01:36:52,779
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took

1018
01:36:53,025 --> 01:36:56,495
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit

1019
01:36:56,745 --> 01:37:00,863
I know how you feel  but there's always the unexpected  isn't there

1020
01:37:01,425 --> 01:37:03,063
Tell that to Chapman

1021
01:37:03,345 --> 01:37:04,858
Let's get cracking

1022
01:40:01,265 --> 01:40:02,857
You're lovely

1023
01:40:05,305 --> 01:40:06,499
Lovely

1024
01:40:06,745 --> 01:40:08,861
Be happy in your work

1025
01:40:09,145 --> 01:40:10,260
Yes  sir

1026
01:40:36,545 --> 01:40:37,864
Leeches

1027
01:40:38,425 --> 01:40:39,858
Leeches

1028
01:40:54,545 --> 01:40:58,458
She's telling you to hold still  She'll take the leeches off your back

1029
01:40:58,825 --> 01:41:01,055
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this

1030
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:03,694
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese

1031
01:41:03,945 --> 01:41:07,301
No  that would spoil it  Too much talk always spoils it

1032
01:41:07,505 --> 01:41:08,904
What's wrong with that thing

1033
01:41:09,145 --> 01:41:12,660
It's taken an awful beating  I can't get a strong signal

1034
01:41:12,905 --> 01:41:17,820
I'll tell you  It's wet  mildewed Like everything else in this jungle

1035
01:41:18,225 --> 01:41:19,863
You might as well dump it

1036
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:26,861
This is Radio Tokyo signing off

1037
01:41:27,065 --> 01:41:31,377
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy

1038
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:34,059
and never volunteer for anything

1039
01:41:46,705 --> 01:41:48,661
If we stay  we'll be up to our necks

1040
01:41:48,865 --> 01:41:51,060
I've got it all decoded  sir   Read it

1041
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:54,980
Yes  sir  "One  original bridge works reported abandoned

1042
01:41:55,185 --> 01:41:57,699
New construction downstream from first site

1043
01:41:57,945 --> 01:42:01,858
Two  enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train

1044
01:42:02,065 --> 01:42:04,898
Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V I P

1045
01:42:05,145 --> 01:42:07,659
Estimated to arrive target  a m  13th

1046
01:42:07,865 --> 01:42:10,902
Three  synchronize demolition with passage of train

1047
01:42:11,145 --> 01:42:14,137
Four  good hunting  Have fun " That's all

1048
01:42:14,385 --> 01:42:16,103
A train and a bridge

1049
01:42:16,345 --> 01:42:18,461
Can we get there in time  sir

1050
01:42:18,665 --> 01:42:21,020
Yai says we're two to three days away

1051
01:42:21,265 --> 01:42:25,178
If we set a faster pace  we could make it before sundown on the 12th

1052
01:42:25,425 --> 01:42:27,256
It's worth it for the train

1053
01:42:27,505 --> 01:42:30,656
Oh  by all means  Good hunting  Good show

1054
01:42:30,865 --> 01:42:32,776
Jolly good fun  Jolly good

1055
01:42:33,865 --> 01:42:37,175
If you hadn't fixed the radio  we wouldn't know about the train

1056
01:42:37,425 --> 01:42:40,064
There's always the unexpected  isn't there

1057
01:43:04,185 --> 01:43:06,574
Half a pint  sir   Quinine

1058
01:43:08,225 --> 01:43:10,785
Well  we'll complete this later

1059
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:14,981
Clipton  we're facing a crisis   Yes  sir

1060
01:43:15,945 --> 01:43:19,824
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes  We can't finish the bridge on time

1061
01:43:20,065 --> 01:43:21,578
We haven't the manpower

1062
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:24,982
I've asked the officers to help  but that won't do it

1063
01:43:25,225 --> 01:43:26,738
The officers are working

1064
01:43:26,985 --> 01:43:30,580
I explained the situation and they volunteered  but it's not enough

1065
01:43:30,825 --> 01:43:32,497
Why not ask Saito for some men

1066
01:43:32,745 --> 01:43:35,623
This is ours  We'll make the most of our resources

1067
01:43:35,865 --> 01:43:38,618
That's why I came to talk to you  The sick list

1068
01:43:38,865 --> 01:43:42,494
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there

1069
01:43:42,745 --> 01:43:47,216
It's no reflection on you  but there are always a few malingerers

1070
01:43:47,465 --> 01:43:49,774
Keep an open mind  that's all I ask

1071
01:43:50,025 --> 01:43:51,777
Come along  let's see

1072
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:54,982
Don't move  don't move

1073
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:00,183
What's wrong with Haskins

1074
01:44:00,425 --> 01:44:03,895
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever  Temperature of 104

1075
01:44:04,145 --> 01:44:05,578
Right  I see

1076
01:44:08,545 --> 01:44:09,694
And this man

1077
01:44:09,945 --> 01:44:13,699
Leg ulcers  I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight

1078
01:44:13,945 --> 01:44:15,822
Want to send him out to work

1079
01:44:16,065 --> 01:44:17,783
Don't talk rot  Clipton

1080
01:44:22,065 --> 01:44:23,100
That man there

1081
01:44:23,345 --> 01:44:24,494
His arm's infected

1082
01:44:24,745 --> 01:44:26,975
Most of their wounds won't heal properly

1083
01:44:27,185 --> 01:44:31,895
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up

1084
01:44:32,145 --> 01:44:35,023
Light duties   It's not our policy to keep a man

1085
01:44:35,265 --> 01:44:38,905
just because he scratched his arm   Not our policy

1086
01:44:39,145 --> 01:44:42,979
A man may not be on top of his form  but he can still be useful

1087
01:44:43,225 --> 01:44:46,695
Trimmings and finishing jobs  Stand easy  Baker

1088
01:44:46,945 --> 01:44:50,381
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge

1089
01:44:51,945 --> 01:44:54,379
Anything you say  sir   Good show

1090
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:57,024
You  Nothing difficult

1091
01:44:57,265 --> 01:44:59,574
I'll try  sir   Good man

1092
01:45:01,265 --> 01:45:05,816
Look here  men  It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you

1093
01:45:06,065 --> 01:45:10,422
But we're facing a crisis  For those of you who feel up to it

1094
01:45:10,665 --> 01:45:14,578
how about lending us a hand  Fetch and carry  paint here and there

1095
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:16,178
What do you say

1096
01:45:16,385 --> 01:45:19,855
Yes  sir   Good show  Come on  follow me

1097
01:46:58,225 --> 01:46:59,214
Ten minutes

1098
01:48:52,425 --> 01:48:54,222
Make sure they're all dead

1099
01:48:57,545 --> 01:48:58,864
Come on  Joyce

1100
01:49:00,985 --> 01:49:03,499
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other

1101
01:49:15,305 --> 01:49:16,897
Go that way  Joyce

1102
01:51:20,065 --> 01:51:22,784
I could have done it  I was ready

1103
01:51:27,105 --> 01:51:28,424
Are you hit  sir

1104
01:51:28,785 --> 01:51:30,013
Let's go

1105
01:51:50,505 --> 01:51:54,054
It's superficial  Maybe a chipped bone  but nothing broken

1106
01:51:54,305 --> 01:51:56,341
It's my fault  sir   Oh  shut up

1107
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:58,974
I can walk on it  That's all that counts

1108
01:51:59,185 --> 01:52:00,857
Yeah  but how far and how fast

1109
01:52:01,065 --> 01:52:03,625
We won't know that till I've tried it  will we

1110
01:55:06,925 --> 01:55:08,517
What are you doing

1111
01:55:08,965 --> 01:55:10,956
I didn't give orders for a halt

1112
01:55:11,165 --> 01:55:12,564
We all need it

1113
01:55:16,485 --> 01:55:19,875
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective

1114
01:55:20,085 --> 01:55:21,359
Maybe six

1115
01:55:22,365 --> 01:55:23,480
Come on

1116
01:55:23,685 --> 01:55:26,119
If you keep walking  you'll bleed to death

1117
01:55:33,405 --> 01:55:36,317
You're going to leave me here   If you stop  we stop

1118
01:55:37,205 --> 01:55:39,719
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark

1119
01:55:39,925 --> 01:55:41,961
You've got to get there before sundown

1120
01:55:42,165 --> 01:55:46,636
But  sir  when the job's done  who knows if we can return by this route

1121
01:55:46,885 --> 01:55:48,921
or whether we could find you if we did

1122
01:55:49,165 --> 01:55:52,555
If you were me  I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that

1123
01:55:52,965 --> 01:55:54,159
He doesn't know  but I do

1124
01:55:54,405 --> 01:55:57,715
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it

1125
01:55:58,405 --> 01:56:01,715
You'll go on without me  That's an order

1126
01:56:01,925 --> 01:56:04,120
You're in command now  Shears

1127
01:56:06,765 --> 01:56:08,517
I won't obey that order

1128
01:56:09,085 --> 01:56:10,564
Your heroics make me sick

1129
01:56:10,765 --> 01:56:13,438
You carry the stench of death like the plague

1130
01:56:13,685 --> 01:56:15,801
Explosives and L pills go well together

1131
01:56:16,165 --> 01:56:19,475
It's one thing or the other  Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself

1132
01:56:19,805 --> 01:56:21,443
This is just a game  this war

1133
01:56:21,685 --> 01:56:25,439
You and that Colonel Nicholson  You're crazy with courage  For what

1134
01:56:25,685 --> 01:56:28,518
How to die like a gentleman  how to die by the rules

1135
01:56:28,725 --> 01:56:32,320
when the only important thing is how to live like a human being

1136
01:56:36,165 --> 01:56:38,918
I'm not gonna leave you here to die  Warden

1137
01:56:40,205 --> 01:56:43,914
because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules

1138
01:56:44,365 --> 01:56:46,925
If we go on  we go on together

1139
01:56:49,725 --> 01:56:51,317
Good old Yai

1140
01:57:02,805 --> 01:57:03,920
All right

1141
01:57:14,165 --> 01:57:15,393
Come on

1142
01:58:02,885 --> 01:58:04,284
Let's get closer

1143
01:58:23,005 --> 01:58:25,121
Still sorry we brought you along

1144
01:58:26,725 --> 01:58:28,556
Feeling better   Yeah

1145
01:58:28,765 --> 01:58:30,915
You're in command again  you know

1146
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:32,717
Thank you  major

1147
01:58:33,565 --> 01:58:38,355
I can't understand it  It's such a solid  well designed job

1148
01:58:40,965 --> 01:58:43,718
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together

1149
01:58:44,045 --> 01:58:45,239
Look

1150
01:58:47,005 --> 01:58:48,961
Those poor devils down there

1151
01:58:49,205 --> 01:58:52,880
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in

1152
01:58:53,965 --> 01:58:56,843
They've got a British officer working on his knees

1153
01:58:57,085 --> 01:58:59,076
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too

1154
01:59:00,205 --> 01:59:02,924
If he knew we were here  it might boost his morale

1155
01:59:21,605 --> 01:59:24,845
If not for the train  we could set a time fuse and be miles away

1156
01:59:25,045 --> 01:59:27,764
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow

1157
01:59:28,005 --> 01:59:30,125
we'll have to do the job manually

1158
01:59:30,765 --> 01:59:33,404
We'll set the charges against the piles

1159
01:59:33,645 --> 01:59:37,001
about three feet underwater  I should think

1160
01:59:37,245 --> 01:59:40,442
and run the main wire downstream to the plunger

1161
01:59:41,645 --> 01:59:44,364
The problem is where to hide it

1162
01:59:49,325 --> 01:59:52,237
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese

1163
01:59:52,565 --> 01:59:54,362
They'd spot it at once

1164
01:59:58,045 --> 02:00:01,082
Look  Do you see those fallen tree trunks

1165
02:00:01,325 --> 02:00:04,476
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach

1166
02:00:05,045 --> 02:00:08,401
Yes  sir  I see them   That's our key position

1167
02:00:09,405 --> 02:00:10,918
The wrong side of the river

1168
02:00:11,165 --> 02:00:14,601
but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance

1169
02:00:16,005 --> 02:00:17,996
As soon as the bridge goes up

1170
02:00:18,445 --> 02:00:21,198
whoever's there will have to swim back

1171
02:00:21,405 --> 02:00:23,316
It won't be a pleasant swim

1172
02:00:23,565 --> 02:00:25,999
Sir  I was the best swimmer in my course

1173
02:00:28,765 --> 02:00:31,040
It looks like your line of country  then

1174
02:00:31,245 --> 02:00:32,041
Thank you

1175
02:00:32,245 --> 02:00:35,920
Shears  pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce

1176
02:00:36,165 --> 02:00:38,963
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips

1177
02:00:39,165 --> 02:00:41,235
if they make trouble for Joyce

1178
02:00:41,485 --> 02:00:43,840
On the theory that there's always one more thing

1179
02:00:44,085 --> 02:00:48,317
I'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion

1180
02:00:48,565 --> 02:00:51,796
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train

1181
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:53,239
All clear

1182
02:00:53,485 --> 02:00:56,636
Any questions  Right  you'll start as soon as it's dark

1183
02:00:56,845 --> 02:00:59,564
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge

1184
02:00:59,765 --> 02:01:03,440
so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver

1185
02:01:03,685 --> 02:01:05,437
which means building a raft

1186
02:01:05,645 --> 02:01:06,634
Yai

1187
02:01:11,445 --> 02:01:13,800
Yai will take three women to help you

1188
02:01:14,045 --> 02:01:17,003
One will stay here with me  All right  get cracking

1189
02:01:22,045 --> 02:01:26,197
You know  if it wasn't for my ankle  I'd take Joyce's assignment

1190
02:01:26,805 --> 02:01:28,602
You think he'll be all right

1191
02:01:28,885 --> 02:01:31,194
I think so  Want me to handle it

1192
02:01:31,765 --> 02:01:34,598
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could

1193
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:36,399
I'm sorry

1194
02:01:37,085 --> 02:01:39,519
When it's over  I hope you get that medical discharge

1195
02:01:39,725 --> 02:01:41,602
and not the hard way

1196
02:01:41,805 --> 02:01:42,999
Thanks

1197
02:02:19,605 --> 02:02:20,594
Load

1198
02:03:23,725 --> 02:03:24,953
Beautiful

1199
02:03:25,685 --> 02:03:27,277
Yes  beautiful

1200
02:03:27,565 --> 02:03:29,283
A first rate job

1201
02:03:29,725 --> 02:03:32,080
I had no idea it would turn out so well

1202
02:03:37,245 --> 02:03:39,475
Yes  a beautiful creation

1203
02:03:40,645 --> 02:03:42,078
I've been thinking

1204
02:03:43,045 --> 02:03:47,482
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service

1205
02:03:47,765 --> 02:03:50,279
Twenty eight years in peace and war

1206
02:03:51,525 --> 02:03:55,074
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time

1207
02:03:55,645 --> 02:03:57,875
Still  it's been a good life

1208
02:03:59,165 --> 02:04:01,201
I love India

1209
02:04:02,725 --> 02:04:04,875
I wouldn't have had it any other way

1210
02:04:06,485 --> 02:04:08,123
But there are times

1211
02:04:09,725 --> 02:04:13,877
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning

1212
02:04:14,845 --> 02:04:16,324
And you wonder

1213
02:04:17,925 --> 02:04:19,881
You ask yourself

1214
02:04:21,165 --> 02:04:24,282
what the sum total of your life represents

1215
02:04:25,045 --> 02:04:28,481
what difference your being there at any time made to anything

1216
02:04:28,965 --> 02:04:31,479
or if it made any difference at all  really

1217
02:04:33,045 --> 02:04:36,276
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers

1218
02:04:36,925 --> 02:04:39,314
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy

1219
02:04:39,885 --> 02:04:43,514
but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines

1220
02:04:43,765 --> 02:04:45,676
from time to time

1221
02:04:48,645 --> 02:04:50,283
But tonight

1222
02:04:51,685 --> 02:04:52,674
Tonight

1223
02:04:56,285 --> 02:04:57,684
Blast

1224
02:05:04,325 --> 02:05:05,724
I must be off

1225
02:05:08,445 --> 02:05:11,676
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment

1226
02:05:56,645 --> 02:05:57,873
Lovely

1227
02:08:01,525 --> 02:08:04,676
If you were the only

1228
02:08:04,885 --> 02:08:07,524
Girl in the world

1229
02:08:07,725 --> 02:08:12,640
And you were the only boy

1230
02:08:13,045 --> 02:08:15,320
Nothing else would matter

1231
02:08:15,525 --> 02:08:18,483
In the world today

1232
02:08:18,965 --> 02:08:20,921
We could go on loving

1233
02:08:21,125 --> 02:08:24,197
In the same old way

1234
02:08:24,765 --> 02:08:29,680
A Garden of Eden just made for two

1235
02:12:52,365 --> 02:12:54,117
I'm sure I speak for all of us

1236
02:12:54,325 --> 02:12:57,283
when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening

1237
02:12:58,965 --> 02:13:03,880
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction

1238
02:13:04,325 --> 02:13:08,477
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge

1239
02:13:08,725 --> 02:13:11,285
You'll be glad to know that the completion

1240
02:13:11,525 --> 02:13:13,641
of this link in the railway

1241
02:13:13,845 --> 02:13:17,076
will enable us to transport the sick and disabled

1242
02:13:17,325 --> 02:13:20,283
to the new camp by train

1243
02:13:21,845 --> 02:13:24,678
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind

1244
02:13:24,885 --> 02:13:27,115
with Major Clipton and the sick men

1245
02:13:27,365 --> 02:13:30,721
and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time

1246
02:13:32,685 --> 02:13:35,685
Now that your work here is finished

1247
02:13:35,925 --> 02:13:39,804
I suppose many of you feel somewhat let down

1248
02:13:40,565 --> 02:13:42,476
That's quite understandable

1249
02:13:42,765 --> 02:13:45,279
It's a very natural reaction

1250
02:13:47,565 --> 02:13:50,682
But one day  in a week  a month  a year

1251
02:13:50,885 --> 02:13:54,560
on that day when  God willing  we all return to our homes again

1252
02:13:55,245 --> 02:14:00,160
you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here

1253
02:14:00,485 --> 02:14:03,079
in the face of great adversity

1254
02:14:04,245 --> 02:14:06,281
What you have done should be

1255
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:08,877
and I think will be

1256
02:14:09,245 --> 02:14:13,682
an example to all our countrymen  soldier and civilian alike

1257
02:14:14,845 --> 02:14:17,279
You have survived with honor

1258
02:14:18,165 --> 02:14:19,883
That  and more

1259
02:14:21,445 --> 02:14:23,481
Here in the wilderness

1260
02:14:23,765 --> 02:14:27,075
you have turned defeat into victory

1261
02:14:29,725 --> 02:14:31,681
I congratulate you

1262
02:14:32,205 --> 02:14:33,194
Well done

1263
02:14:38,365 --> 02:14:39,593
To the king

1264
02:17:15,325 --> 02:17:16,724
You're in business

1265
02:17:16,925 --> 02:17:20,884
Now  you got everything  Stem  ammunition  pack  canteen  knife

1266
02:17:22,485 --> 02:17:24,680
I'll be directly across the river

1267
02:17:26,085 --> 02:17:28,883
The professor says there's always one more thing to do

1268
02:17:29,565 --> 02:17:31,681
I can't think of what it could be

1269
02:17:33,045 --> 02:17:35,479
Except to wish you a long and happy life

1270
02:17:35,885 --> 02:17:36,920
Thank you

1271
02:19:47,085 --> 02:19:48,484
What's happened

1272
02:19:53,445 --> 02:19:55,117
The river's gone down

1273
02:20:16,445 --> 02:20:18,276
You can see the wire

1274
02:20:19,085 --> 02:20:20,313
The charges

1275
02:22:23,365 --> 02:22:25,674
Don't wait for the train

1276
02:22:25,965 --> 02:22:27,000
Do it now

1277
02:22:53,445 --> 02:22:57,120
If Saito is correct  the train will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes

1278
02:22:57,365 --> 02:23:00,004
If you don't mind  I'll watch from up on the hill

1279
02:23:00,245 --> 02:23:02,076
Why  It's better from the bridge

1280
02:23:02,325 --> 02:23:05,681
It's hard to explain  sir  I'd rather not be a part of it

1281
02:23:05,925 --> 02:23:10,077
As you please  Honestly  sometimes I don't understand you at all

1282
02:23:10,325 --> 02:23:14,477
As you once said  sir  I've got a lot to learn about the army

1283
02:23:21,165 --> 02:23:22,484
Good morning

1284
02:23:22,725 --> 02:23:24,875
River's gone down in the night

1285
02:25:05,325 --> 02:25:06,440
What's he doing

1286
02:25:51,325 --> 02:25:54,317
Colonel  there's something rather odd going on

1287
02:25:54,565 --> 02:25:58,080
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across

1288
02:26:54,525 --> 02:26:55,878
He's gone mad

1289
02:26:56,085 --> 02:26:58,076
He's leading him right to it

1290
02:26:58,325 --> 02:26:59,678
Our own man

1291
02:27:42,085 --> 02:27:44,883
I was right  There is something going on

1292
02:28:37,765 --> 02:28:40,962
You've got to do it  boy You've got to do it now

1293
02:28:43,685 --> 02:28:47,473
Have you a knife  I just realized the bridge has been mined

1294
02:28:47,685 --> 02:28:49,045
Mined

1295
02:28:55,685 --> 02:28:56,720
Good boy

1296
02:29:01,485 --> 02:29:04,124
British officer Here to blow up the bridge

1297
02:29:04,365 --> 02:29:08,324
Blow up the bridge  Yes  sir  British commando orders

1298
02:29:08,565 --> 02:29:11,079
Blow up the bridge   Yes  There's no time

1299
02:29:11,285 --> 02:29:13,640
No  no Help

1300
02:29:20,605 --> 02:29:22,800
Kill him Kill him

1301
02:29:23,165 --> 02:29:25,520
Let me go  sir You don't understand

1302
02:29:26,525 --> 02:29:29,278
Kill him Kill him

1303
02:29:39,165 --> 02:29:40,883
Kill him  Joyce

1304
02:30:32,165 --> 02:30:33,154
You

1305
02:30:34,125 --> 02:30:35,717
You

1306
02:30:49,045 --> 02:30:50,717
What have I done

1307
02:31:56,605 --> 02:31:58,084
Madness

1308
02:32:10,125 --> 02:32:11,877
I had to do it

1309
02:32:12,765 --> 02:32:15,882
I had to do it  They might have been captured alive

1310
02:32:16,365 --> 02:32:18,276
It was the only thing to do

1311
02:32:53,085 --> 02:32:54,484
Madness

1312
02:32:57,165 --> 02:32:58,314
Madness
