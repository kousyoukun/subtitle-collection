1
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,936
快点干完活！
Finish work!

2
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,396
到棚屋去
Go to hut.

3
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,148
是啊 要不让新来的俘虏
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,152
看到我们在挖坟墓 他们会要逃跑的
If the new prisoners see us digging graves, they may run.

5
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,447
没时间说笑了 快点干！
No time for jokes. Finish work!

6
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,657
挖 挖
Dig, dig.

7
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,452
把我们算作病号 怎么样？
How about putting us on sick list?

8
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,789
发发慈悲吧 上尉 把我们放到医院里吧
Have a heart, captain. Put us in hospital.

9
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,334
你现在没有病 你从来没有病
You no sick. You never sick.

10
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,045
你为什么一直要装病 舍尔斯？
Why you always play sick, Shears?

11
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,173
我猜我不想放个这玩意儿在我头顶上
Don't want one of these over my head, I guess.

12
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,717
金松上尉…
Captain Kanematsu...

13
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,637
…烟屁股怎么样？
...how about a butt?

14
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,556
我今早才给你的 给你们俩
I give you butt this morning. Both of you.

15
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,018
是的 我不是那意思 我想回报一下
That's what I mean. I want to return the favour.

16
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,021
当一个好心人给我礼物…
When a man gives a gift from the goodness of his heart...

17
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,150
…就像你给我那烟屁股 我会牢记在心的
...like you gave me that butt, I remember it from the heart.

18
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,278
这就是为什么…
That's why...

19
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,406
…我想给你这打火机
...l want you to keep this lighter.

20
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,246
以为是我偷的？
Think I stole it?

21
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,165
这是我们刚刚埋的那个英国小伙子的
It belonged to that English kid we just buried.

22
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,126
是他感激我而送给我的
He gave it to me for a favour I'd done him.

23
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,338
在我死前 我想把它送给你
Before I pass on, I want to do the same for you.

24
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
你这个人真有趣 舍尔斯
You funny man, Shears.

25
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,972
你现在是病号了 他也是
You go on sick list. Him too.

26
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,977
总有一天 Saito 上校会发现你在贿赂他…
One of these days Colonel Saito will catch you bribing him...

27
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,854
…那时我们会怎么样？
...then where'll we be?

28
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,859
在那之前 我们早就离开这里了 伙计
Before that happens we'll be far away from here, chum.

29
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,152
逃得远远的
Far away.

30
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,864
好吧 我们收工吧
Okay, let's knock off.

31
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,617
这里躺着…
Here lies....

32
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,204
我忘掉了我们刚才埋的是谁
I forgot who we just buried.

33
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,706
汤姆森
Thomson.

34
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,291
啊 对
Ah, yes.

35
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,501
这里躺着赫伯特 汤姆森下士…
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

36
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,547
…编号是:01234567
...serial number zero- one- two-  three- four- five- six- seven.

37
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,760
国王或女王或着什么的勇敢的战士…
Valiant member of the King's Own or the Queen's Own or something...

38
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,557
…在我主纪元1943 死于脚气病…
...who died of beri- beri in the year of our Lord, 1 943...

39
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,268
…为了光荣伟大的…
...for the greater glory of....

40
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,646
- 他是为了什么死的？ - 算了
- What did he die for? - Come off it.

41
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,107
不要嘲笑死人
No need to mock the grave.

42
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,444
我没有嘲笑死人
I don't mock the grave or the man.

43
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,572
希望他能在和平中安息
May he rest in peace.

44
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,119
虽然在他活着的时候没有找到和平
He found little of it while he was alive.

45
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,363
A 队 原地踏步走！
"A" Company, mark time!

46
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,213
原地踏步走！
Mark time!

47
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,622
立定
Halt.

48
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,836
排成一行 向左转
Into line, left turn.

49
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,091
稍息
Stand easy.

50
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,309
我们又要挖很多墓 维佛
We're going to be busy gravediggers, Weaver.

51
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,812
干的好 干的好
Well done, well done.

52
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,949
那个上校还不知道他将会遭遇到什么
That colonel doesn't know what he's in for.

53
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,201
你准备去告诉他真相？
You going to tell him the truth?

54
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,702
当然不
Of course not.

55
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,746
你既不是军官也不是个绅士
You're neither an officer nor a gentleman.

56
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,906
我叫 尼科尔森
My name is Nicholson.

57
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,118
我是Saito 上校
I am Colonel Saito.

58
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:58,801
我以天皇的名义…
In the name of His lmperial Majesty...

59
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,887
…欢迎你们
...l welcome you.

60
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,057
我是这个战俘营的指挥官…
I am the commanding officer of this camp...

61
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,311
…这里是沿着这条大铁路…
...which is Camp 1 6...

62
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,897
…的第16战俘营…
...along the great railroad...

63
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:16,319
…这条铁路很快就将曼谷和仰光连接起来
...which will soon connect Bangkok with Rangoon.

64
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,782
你们这些英军俘虏…
You British prisoners have been chosen...

65
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,202
…将要去修建一座跨越桂河的大桥
...to build a bridge across the River Kwai.

66
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:30,416
这将是一个愉快的工作 但需要技能
It will be pleasant work, requiring skill.

67
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,504
军官也要和士兵一起工作
And officers will work as well as men.

68
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:41,093
我们小日本军队不会养吃白饭的懒人
The Japanese Army cannot have idle mouths to feed.

69
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:46,307
如果你努力工作 就会得到优待
If you work hard, you will be treated well.

70
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,102
但是如果你不努力工作…
But if you do not work hard...

71
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,897
…你将受到惩罚
...you will be punished.

72
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,818
关于逃跑 我要说几句
A word to you about escape.

73
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,155
这里没有铁丝网
There is no barbed wire.

74
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,449
没有围栏
No stockade.

75
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,451
也没有了望哨
No watchtower.

76
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,121
这些都不需要
They are not necessary.

77
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,999
我们处于热带雨林中一个孤岛
We are an island in the jungle.

78
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,211
逃出去是不可能的
Escape is impossible.

79
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,255
会死在雨林中的
You would die.

80
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,886
今天休息 明天开始干活
Today you rest. Tomorrow you'll begin.

81
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,226
最后让我告诉你们山下将军的格言:
Let me remind you of General Yamashita's motto:

82
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,269
"在工作中寻求快乐"
" Be happy in your work."

83
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,939
在工作中寻求快乐
Be happy in your work.

84
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,943
解散
Dismissed.

85
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,159
全体 稍息
Battalion, stand at ease.

86
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,828
出队 休斯上校
Fall out, Major Hughes.

87
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,205
全体 稍息
Battalion, stand easy.

88
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,542
休斯 把他们带到岗位上去 看看谁生病了
Hughes, get the men to their quarters. See who's sick.

89
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,128
我要和这家伙说句话
I'm going to have a word with this fellow.

90
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,386
我刚才听了你的训话 先生
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

91
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,348
我的部下会坚持英国士兵的一贯方式
My men will carry on in the way one expects of a British soldier.

92
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,935
我的军官和我会对他们的行为负责
My officers and I will be responsible for their conduct.

93
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:17,273
你可能没注意到让军官去劳动…
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour...

94
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,942
…在日内瓦公约中是不允许的
...is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention.

95
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,402
是那样的吗？
Is that so?

96
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,320
我有一份公约的复印件…
I have a copy of the convention...

97
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,532
…我很乐意让你看一下
...and would be glad to let you glance through it.

98
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,160
不用了
That will not be necessary.

99
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,456
请坐
Sit down, please.

100
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,507
是 长官
Yes, sir.

101
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,928
我要和科林普顿说句话
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.

102
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,515
科林普顿 不要让别人打扰我
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

103
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,558
- 胳膊怎么样了？ - 快好了
- How's the arm? - Nearly healed.

104
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,270
先生 这是美国海军的舍尔斯司令官
Sir, this is Commander Shears of the United States Navy.

105
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
你好 先生
How do you do, sir?

106
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,649
我们发现他和一个澳大利亚人
We found him and an Australian.

107
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,943
是修建这个营地的仅存俘虏
All that's left of the prisoners who built the camp.

108
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,861
美国海军？ 大老远的跑到这里？
U.S. Navy? Out here?

109
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,114
我们差不多被陆地包围了
I am sort of landlocked.

110
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,533
- 然后你丢弃了你的船？ - 休斯顿号
- You lost your ship? - The Houston.

111
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:36,203
我让它搁浅 但是我和其他的幸存者失散了
I made it ashore, but I got separated from the other survivors.

112
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,871
这儿原来和你在一起的人呢？
And your group here?

113
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,332
多数是澳洲人 一些…
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

114
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,835
英国人还有印度人 缅甸人 暹罗人
Some British. Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

115
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,712
他们怎么了？
And what happened to them?

116
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
他们都死于…
They died...

117
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:51,802
…疟疾 痢疾 脚气和坏疽
...of malaria, dysentery, beri- beri, gangrene.

118
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,303
其他的死因是:
Other causes of death:

119
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,641
饥饿 劳累过度 枪伤 蛇咬…
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds, snakebites...

120
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,601
…还有 Saito
...Saito.

121
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,147
然后还有一些不想过了
Then there were some who just got tired of living.

122
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,648
科林普顿给你检查过了吗？
Has Clipton seen you?

123
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,026
正好就要看了 过来 你可以待会刮脸
Just about to. Come over here, you can shave later.

124
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,446
好的
All right.

125
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,950
你可以和军官待在一起
You'll stay with the officers.

126
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,869
我们会给你找一些象样的衣服
We'll find some decent clothing.

127
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,537
不要为我操心了
Don't bother about me.

128
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,998
我还不想急着离开病号房
I'm not anxious to get off the sick list.

129
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,084
另外 这是劳动工具 这儿流行这个
Besides, this is working kit. It's the fashion here.

130
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,462
你们当时连军官都干体力劳动吗？
The officers in your party did manual labour?

131
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,380
我想是的
I think you could call it that.

132
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,842
我可以列举出那个上校让我们做的每一点 他叫什么来着
I raised that very point with Colonel what's- his- name.

133
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,302
斋藤
Saito.

134
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,430
- 我认为他现在明白那样做是不对的了 - 是吗？
- I think he understands now. - Is that so?

135
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,975
是的 我必须说明 他看起来好像是那种很通情达理的类型
Yes. I must say he seems quite a reasonable type.

136
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,102
是这样啊 那我可得抓紧了
Well, I must be pushing on.

137
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,146
7点钟有个军官会议
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

138
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,274
- 把你的要求列个单子 - 是 长官
- Give me a list of your requirements. - Yes, sir.

139
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,276
我们会尽量满足
Anything we can do.

140
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,195
谢谢 长官
Thank you, sir.

141
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,866
- 这是为什么？ - 别介意
- What is it? - Never mind.

142
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,493
说说看
Go on, say it.

143
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,871
我可以想象出很多称呼Saito的词
I can think of a lot of things to call Saito...

144
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,583
…"通情达理" 倒是第一次听说
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

145
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,920
或许尼科尔森上校对这个词有不同的定义
Perhaps Col. Nicholson defines the word differently.

146
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,180
有其他补充的吗？
Any other points?

147
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
- 可以允许我说吗 长官？ - 詹宁斯？
- By your leave, sir? - Jennings?

148
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,185
有关逃跑委员会 我已经和舍尔斯司令官讨论过了…
About the escape committee. I've spoken with Cmd. Shears...

149
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,270
不会再有什么逃跑委员会了
There won't be any escape committee.

150
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,065
我不明白 长官 詹宁斯少尉有个计划
I don't understand, sir. Lt. Jennings has a plan.

151
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,109
是的 是的 我相信詹宁斯有个计划 但是 逃到哪里？
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings has a plan, but escape?

152
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,781
逃进雨林？ 那个Saito家伙说的是对的
Where? lnto this jungle? That fellow, Saito, is right.

153
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:40,035
这里是不需要铁丝网 逃进雨林只有1/100的生存可能
No need for barbed wire here. One chance in 1 00 of survival.

154
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,414
我认为象舍尔斯司令官 那样有经验的人会支持我的计划
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears' experience will back me up on that.

155
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,418
我说过了逃跑成功的可能性是1/100
I'd say that the odds against a successful escape are 1 00 to one.

156
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,462
我可以插个嘴吗？
But may I add another word?

157
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,964
请
Please.

158
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,342
在这个战俘营的生存概率还要小
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse.

159
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,595
你已经看到了那些坟墓 他们是你在这里生存的真实几率
You've seen the graveyard. They're your real odds.

160
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,055
放弃逃走的希望…
To give up hope of escape...

161
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,642
…甚至不去考虑逃走 意味着接受死亡宣判
...to stop thinking about it means accepting a death sentence.

162
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,561
为什么到目前你还没有试着逃跑呢 司令官先生？
Why haven't you tried to escape, commander?

163
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,691
我在等候良机 等待正确的时间 和正确的伙伴
I'm biding my time. Waiting for the right moment, the right company.

164
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,985
我知道你的感受
I understand how you feel.

165
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,115
当然 作为一个被俘士兵 逃跑是他的天职
Of course, it's the duty of a captured soldier to attempt escape.

166
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,243
但是我和我的部下正处在一个奇怪的境地…
But my men and I are involved in a curious legal point...

167
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,662
而你并不知道这个
...of which you are unaware.

168
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,582
在新加坡 是指挥部命令我们投降的
In Singapore we were ordered to surrender by command headquarters.

169
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,501
请注意 是命令
Ordered, mind you.

170
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:34,256
所以 在我们这种情况下 逃跑就会违反战争法
Therefore, in our case, escape might well be an infraction of military law.

171
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,757
这真有意思 长官
Interesting point, sir.

172
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,552
对不起 长官 我不能同意你的观点
I'm sorry, sir, I didn't quite follow you.

173
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,389
你想不惜一切代价去遵守法律条文？
You intend to uphold the letter of the law, no matter what it costs?

174
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,308
没有了法律 指挥官先生 就不会有文明的存在
Without law, commander, there is no civilization.

175
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,937
这正是我的观点 在这里 没有文明
That's just my point. Here, there is no civilization.

176
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,982
那么 我们正好有机会在这里引进文明
Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.

177
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,318
我建议否决逃跑的议题
I suggest we drop the subject of escape.

178
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,072
还有什么要说的吗？
Is there anything else?

179
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,869
我想我们都清楚了
I think we're clear on the program.

180
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,748
我想从明天开始所有的事情都能顺利展开
I want everything to go off smoothly starting tomorrow morning.

181
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,541
并且 请各位记住:
And remember this:

182
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,836
必须要让我们的人感觉是我们在指挥他们…
Our men must always feel they are still commanded by us...

183
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,046
…而不是小日本
...and not by the Japanese.

184
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,551
这样 他们就会还是士兵 而不是奴隶
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

185
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,887
同意我的观点吗 指挥官先生？
Are you with me there, commander?

186
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,519
我希望他们还能是士兵 上校
I hope they can remain soldiers, colonel.

187
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,897
可我只是个奴隶
As for me, I'm just a slave.

188
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,232
一个还活着的奴隶
A living slave.

189
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,748
即使在美国人来说 他也是个古怪的家伙…
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

190
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,001
被囚禁得太久了 可怜的家伙
He's been in isolation too long, poor chap.

191
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:57,339
这就是脱离自己人的结果 对我们也是个教训
Cut off from his unit. It should be a lesson to all of us.

192
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,773
英军俘虏们！
English prisoners!

193
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:20,612
请注意我不是说"英军士兵"
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

194
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:26,701
当你们投降的那一刻起 你们就不是士兵了
From the moment you surrendered, you ceased to be soldiers.

195
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:32,707
你们要在五月12号前完成大桥
You will finish the bridge by the twelfth day of May.

196
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,213
你们会在小日本工程师的指导下工作
You will work under the direction of a Japanese engineer.

197
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,679
时间很短 所有人都得工作
Time is short. All men will work.

198
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
你们的军官会和你们一起工作
Your officers will work beside you.

199
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,976
投降就是你们的军官对你们的背叛
This is only just...

200
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,230
这就是对他们背叛你们的处罚
...for it is they who betrayed you by surrender.

201
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:58,024
羞辱你们就是要让羞辱他们
Your shame is their dishonour.

202
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,777
是他们告诉你们…
It is they who told you...

203
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:05,615
…好死不如赖活着
...better to live like a coolie then die like a hero.

204
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,119
是他们让你们来这里的 不是我
It is they who brought you here, not l.

205
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:14,833
所以 他们也要和你们一起干体力活
Therefore, they will join you in useful labour.

206
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,127
完毕
That is all.

207
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,423
军官俘虏们 拿好你们的工具
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

208
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,217
布拉德利 归队
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,184
我必须让你注意 Saito上校…
I must call your attention, Colonel Saito...

210
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,104
…在日内瓦公约的27条
...to Article 27 of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:39,482
" 交战国可以雇用战俘去做他们合适做的工作…
" Belligerents may employ prisoners of war...

212
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,776
…指挥官除外… "
...who are fit, other than officers..."

213
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,278
把书给我
Give me the book.

214
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,072
当然你能读懂英文吗？我有点怀疑
By all means. You read English, I take it?

215
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,450
- 你能读懂日文吗？ - 很遗憾 不会
- Do you read Japanese? - I'm sorry, no.

216
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,953
如果需要翻译 我想我可以安排
If it's a matter of translation, I'm sure it can be arranged.

217
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,164
你看 规则(Code)指出…
You see, the Code states that...

218
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,418
站着别动
Stand fast in the ranks.

219
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,504
你和我说"规则"？
You speak to me of Code?

220
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,257
你说的是什么"规则"？
What " Code"?

221
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,676
你说的是懦夫的"规则"！
The coward's code!

222
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,430
你知道什么是士兵的规则？
What do you know of the soldier's code?

223
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,850
你知道什么是武士道的规则？ 你什么都不知道！
Of bushido? Nothing!

224
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,561
你不配当指挥官！
You are unworthy of command!

225
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:32,535
如果你拒绝遵守文明世界的法规…
If you refuse to abide by the laws of the civilized world...

226
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,414
…那我们要考虑是否有义务去听从你的命令
...we must consider ourselves absolved from our duty to obey you.

227
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:39,918
我的军官不会去做体力劳动
My officers will not do manual labour.

228
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:41,878
我们走着瞧
We shall see.

229
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,885
所有战俘开始去工作
All enlisted prisoners to work.

230
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,649
军士长！ 带他们去工作
Sergeant Major! Take the men to work.

231
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,611
全体注意 拿起工具
Battalion, take up tools.

232
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:13,701
向左靠齐 向左转！
Move to the left in columnar route. Left turn!

233
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:18,706
"A" 队 齐步走
"A" Company, by the right, quick march.

234
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,377
向右看
Eyes right.

235
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,380
向右看
Eyes right.

236
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,973
向前看
Eyes front.

237
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:47,068
齐步走 向右看
Quick march, eyes right.

238
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,040
" C" 队
" C" Company, by the right.

239
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,084
他在等什么？
What's he up to?

240
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,548
好像他不想有人看到
Looks like he doesn't want any witnesses.

241
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,442
现在 你是否会明白一些
Now, you will be reasonable.

242
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,903
命令你的指挥官去开始工作
You will order your officers to work.

243
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,405
不
No.

244
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,688
我数三下
I will count three.

245
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,899
如果数到第三下…
If by the third count...

246
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,570
…你和你的指挥官还没有去工作的话…
...you and your officers are not on the way to work...

247
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,490
…我就下令开枪
...l will give the order to fire.

248
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,168
他会这样做的
He's going to do it.

249
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,213
相信我 他确实想杀了他们
Believe me, he's really going to do it.

250
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:41,808
一
One.

251
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,601
我警告你 上校…
I warn you, Colonel....

252
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,311
二
Two.

253
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:49,732
等一等！
Stop!

254
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,615
Saito上校 我耳闻目睹了一切
Colonel Saito, I've seen and heard everything.

255
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,742
医院里的人也这样
So has every man in the hospital.

256
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,369
有太多的证人
They're too many witnesses.

257
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,623
你不能谎称这是集体逃跑 那些人很多连路都不能走
You can't call it a mass escape. Most of those men can't walk.

258
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,963
这就是你的士兵规则？ 屠杀手无寸铁的人？
Is this your soldier's code? Murdering unarmed men?

259
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,122
詹宁斯 你看 当个病号多好
You see, Jennings, there are advantages to being on the sick list.

260
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,292
我认为那老家伙勇气十足
I'll say this for the old man. He's got guts.

261
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,794
这样会死得更快
" Into the valley of death rode the 600."

262
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,421
怎么会那样 长官？
How's that, sir?

263
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,631
那种愚蠢的勇气
That kind of guts.

264
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,633
就像他们在1914一样…
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4...

265
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,553
…那时 军官们用拐杖来反抗
...when officers fought with only a swagger stick.

266
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:46,057
- 我明白你的意思 - 你一点也不明白我的意思
- I see what you mean. - You don't see what I mean at all.

267
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,185
那种勇气会让我们全部送命的
The kind of guts that can get us all killed.

268
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:33,604
对不起 长官 我也要和你一起逃跑
Excuse me, sir, I'd like to go along too.

269
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:37,775
我的胳膊差不多好了 长官 情况确实象你说的那样
Arm's almost healed, sir, really it is.

270
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,069
那他会同意吗？
What about him?

271
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,739
他并没有命令我们不准逃跑 他只是建议我们不逃跑
He didn't order us not to escape, he suggested.

272
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:48,828
听着 象你们上校那样人的建议就是命令
Listen, when a man like your colonel suggests something, it's an order.

273
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,497
又开始了
Here we go again.

274
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,094
Saito上校命令所有军官去惩戒室
Colonel Saito says all officers to punishment hut.

275
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:07,179
告诉他们去惩戒室
Tell them to go.

276
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:16,897
你留下
Not you.

277
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,079
过来
Come.

278
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,893
放了他！
Leave him alone!

279
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,397
放了他！
Leave him alone!

280
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,327
他们要把他关进闷室
They're going to put him in the oven.

281
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:19,395
# For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

282
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:24,149
# For he's a jolly good fellow

283
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:26,652
# And so say all of us

284
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,698
# And so say all of us And so say all of us

285
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:37,037
# For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

286
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:40,707
# For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,335
# And so say all of us

288
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,799
倒啦！
Timber!

289
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:01,973
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

290
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:07,229
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

291
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:11,858
不行！
No, no, no!

292
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:13,819
松开！
Let go!

293
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:16,696
松开！
Let go!

294
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,413
你想来见我？
You wish to see me?

295
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:08,874
3天来 我一直想见你
I've tried to see you for three days.

296
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:12,210
上校已经被关在闷室里…
It's about the colonel. He's been shut up in that hut...

297
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,382
我应该枪毙你
I could have you shot.

298
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:22,262
那些想逃跑的俘虏是你的手下
Those prisoners who tried to escape, they were in your charge.

299
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:24,347
对逃跑我毫不知情
I knew nothing about the escape.

300
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,184
那无关紧要
It does not matter.

301
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:30,312
那些逃跑的人值得尊敬
One must respect those who tried.

302
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:34,316
在逃亡和死亡的一瞬间…
For a brief moment, between escape and death...

303
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,276
他们又成了战士
...they were soldiers again.

304
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,406
但是试图从这里逃出去是愚蠢的
But it is insane to try and escape.

305
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:45,952
两个被枪打死 第三个被淹死
Two soldiers shot and the third drowned.

306
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,662
到头来又有什么好结果呢？
To what end?

307
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,749
只不过是逃避现实罢了
It was an escape from reality.

308
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,759
这是你的现实
There is your reality.

309
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:05,764
按计划 你们今天中午应该修到这里了
This shows the position work should have reached by noon today.

310
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:09,851
而实际上只到这里
And this shows the position of actual progress.

311
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,733
由于你们上校的愚顽不化 我们的进度远远落后了
Because of your colonel's stubbornness, we are far behind schedule.

312
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:17,984
还不止这些
That is not all.

313
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:21,571
战俘还蓄意破坏
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.

314
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,742
是的 我看到的 我早就应该枪毙他们
Yes, I have seen it. I could have them all shot.

315
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,620
然后 谁替你造桥呢？
Then who would build your bridge?

316
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,830
另外 你认为那真的是蓄意破坏吗？
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

317
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,125
没有了自己的指挥官 他们的工作肯定不会做得太好
The men don't work well without their own officers.

318
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:39,172
我的指挥官会直接领导他们工作 你们的指挥官要和他们一块工作
My officers will direct them. Your officers will work beside them.

319
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,299
那要由尼科尔森来决定
That's for Nicholson to decide.

320
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:43,301
而且就像他说的那样 这样做是违背条约的
As he said, it's against the rules.

321
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,637
别和我谈什么条约
Do not speak to me of rules.

322
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:47,681
这是战争！
This is war!

323
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,974
并不是什么公平的游戏
This is not a game of cricket.

324
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,648
你的上校是个疯子
He's mad, your colonel...

325
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,984
完全是疯了
...quite mad.

326
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:03,947
请坐
Sit down, please.

327
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:13,415
我决定了 只让你一个人去看你们的上校
I have decided to allow you one visit to your colonel.

328
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:15,125
谢谢
Thank you.

329
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:19,838
告诉他 如果他的指挥官还不参加劳动的话…
Tell him that if his officers will not work...

330
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:23,049
我将不得不关闭医院…
...l'll be forced to close the hospital...

331
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,678
然后你的病人将替他们劳动
...and your patients will work in their place.

332
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:31,266
会死掉一些人 这全都要怪他
Many will die, and he will be responsible.

333
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:35,979
去和他讲你只有5分钟时间
Go and speak to him. You have five minutes.

334
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:07,635
医生要去看那老伙计了
Doc's going to see the old man.

335
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,765
长官…
Sir....

336
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,605
是科林普顿 长官
It's Clipton, sir.

337
00:39:20,732 --> 00:39:22,567
我给你带来些东西
I brought you a few things.

338
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:30,450
- 我的部下怎么样了？ - 他们还好 长官
- How are the men? - Fine, sir, fine.

339
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,871
我们给您凑了点肉和一个椰子
We scraped together a little meat and a coconut.

340
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,542
军官们怎么样？
And the officers?

341
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:42,420
不太好 他们还在关禁闭
Not so good. They're still in detention.

342
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,966
詹宁斯上尉死了
And Lieutenant Jennings.... Jennings is dead.

343
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,719
- 什么？ - 在逃跑的时候被枪打死了
- What? - Killed, attempting to escape.

344
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:53,431
还有维佛下士和那个美国人
Also two others, Corporal Weaver and the American.

345
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:58,144
詹宁斯 真可怜 勇敢的小伙子
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

346
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,563
我警告过他 对不对？
I warned him, didn't l, Clipton?

347
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:03,650
长官 我们时间不多了
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

348
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,448
我一边给你清理 一边说
I'm going to clean you up a little while I talk.

349
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:12,825
我有些事情要告诉你
I've got something to tell you.

350
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,536
我和Saito吵过了
I've just had a word with Saito.

351
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,457
那个家伙是我遇过的最差的指挥官
That man is the worst commanding officer I've ever come across.

352
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,752
他是个疯子 你说
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

353
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,229
讹诈！
Blackmail!

354
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:46,109
我知道 长官 但他是认真的
I know, sir, but he means it. I'm sure he does.

355
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,988
很简单 这是个关于面子的问题 但他是不会屈服的
It's a question of face, pure and simple. And he can't give in.

356
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:52,573
但那仍然是讹诈
It's still blackmail.

357
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:59,330
长官 你是撑不过他的
Sir, you can't stand much more of this.

358
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:04,752
我们那些军官被憋在那个闷室里也不是办法
Wouldn't the officers be better off working than suffocating in that hole?

359
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:10,007
我们的士兵在尽量地拖延工期
The men are doing a wonderful job. They're going as slow as they dare.

360
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,302
但是Saito在削减他们的食物配额…
But Saito's cut their food rations...

361
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:15,638
并且一旦他让病人去工作…
...and if he makes the sick men work....

362
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:19,684
很显然就会死很多人
Well, they're going to die. That's all there is to it.

363
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:22,729
是的 科林普顿 我很清楚
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

364
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,523
但是你看到了吗？这关乎原则
But don't you see? It's a matter of principle.

365
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:29,569
如果我们现在屈服了 就会无休无止 不行
If we give in now, there'll be no end to it. No.

366
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:37,076
长官 我们陷在雨林里 远离文明
Sir, we're lost in the jungle, a thousand miles from anywhere.

367
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:41,998
我们是在一个为了达到自己目的可以不择手段的家伙的统治下 更别说原则了！
We're under a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way. Principle!

368
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:46,377
没有人会知道这儿发生了什么 也不会有人关心
No one will ever know or care what happens to us.

369
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,130
退一步吧 长官 求求你了！
Give in, sir. Please!

370
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:50,840
我不会动摇的
I'm adamant.

371
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,802
我不会让我的军官去象一个小工一样干苦力
I will not have an officer from my battalion working as a coolie.

372
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:56,721
- 时间到 - 好的
- Time. - All right.

373
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:02,518
谢谢关心我的人
Please thank those concerned.

374
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:05,646
医院里的每个人都献了一片肉
Everybody in the hospital contributed one piece.

375
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:07,523
雷诺兹偷了个椰子
Reynolds stole the coconut.

376
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:11,903
我们还会给你带来食物的
We'll be able to get you food sometimes.

377
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:14,614
我们已经贿赂了一个看管你的守卫
We've bribed one of your guards.

378
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:24,499
再见 长官 祝好运
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

379
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:26,626
多谢
Many thanks.

380
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:36,636
你说那个美国人被打死了？
Did you say that American was killed?

381
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:39,013
是的 长官 被枪打倒后淹死了
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

382
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:43,601
计划逃跑真是个愚蠢的念头
It's insane to plan escapes.

383
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,688
3人被杀 结果怎么样呢？
Three men killed, and to what end?

384
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:49,190
时间到！
Time!

385
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:52,485
我们在这里一定能胜利
Here is where we must win through.

386
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:16,759
医生看着我们并摇摇头 什么意思
Doc just looked at us and shook his head. Whatever that means.

387
00:43:16,968 --> 00:43:20,554
只有一个意思 上校不会屈服
Means only one thing, the colonel won't give in.

388
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:34,652
怎么样？
Well?

389
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,570
是这样的
It's like this.

390
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:39,490
尼科尔森上校不准备向武力屈服
Colonel Nicholson won't give in to force.

391
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,867
这是个原则的问题
It's a question of principle.

392
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,579
作为医疗官 我抗议对他的折磨
As medical officer, I protest the way he's being treated.

393
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,790
他还能活着 真是奇迹
It's a wonder he's still alive.

394
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:52,003
如果发生悲剧 那和谋杀是一样的
Should a tragedy occur, it would be tantamount to murder.

395
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,340
要怪就怪他
He is responsible.

396
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,051
不是我
Not l.

397
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,938
你病了？
You sick?

398
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:16,777
他们都疯了吗？
Are they both mad?

399
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,322
或者我也要发疯了？
Or am I going mad?

400
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:23,701
太阳也疯了？
Or is it the sun?

401
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,801
立正！
Attention!

402
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,764
全体立正
Battalion, attention.

403
00:47:34,558 --> 00:47:36,769
英军俘虏们
English prisoners.

404
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,480
让我们问一个问题…
Let us ask the question...

405
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,900
…为什么大桥进展迟缓？
...why does the bridge not progress?

406
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:48,572
你们知道为什么 因为你们的指挥官是懒惰的！
You know why, because your officers are lazy!

407
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:53,243
他们认为自己高人一等 而不愿和你们分担
They think themselves too good to share your burden.

408
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:55,788
这是不公平的
This is not just.

409
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:59,208
所以 你们工作起来也不愉快
Therefore, you are not happy in your work.

410
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:03,420
所以 大桥也没有什么进展
Therefore, the bridge does not progress.

411
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:06,215
但是还有一个原因
But there is another cause.

412
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:09,510
我不避讳事实
I do not hide the truth.

413
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:12,638
我很惭愧…
With deep shame and regret...

414
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:15,182
…我承认也是由于我们的一个小日本狗屎
...l admit to you the failure...

415
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:18,268
…的无能
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

416
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:20,729
我是指 Miura上尉
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

417
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,398
他是一个很差的工程师
He is a bad engineer.

418
00:48:23,649 --> 00:48:25,901
他的指挥毫不称职
He is unworthy of command.

419
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,864
所以 我把他撤换了
Therefore, I have removed him from his post.

420
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:36,620
明天 我们重新开始
Tomorrow we begin again.

421
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,374
我会亲自指挥
I shall be in personal command.

422
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:42,960
今天 我们休息
Today we rest.

423
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,550
只有工作而没有娱乐会很不爽的！
All work and no play make Jack a dull boy!

424
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,512
为了你们明天努力工作…
As token of regard for your efforts in the future...

425
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:56,306
…我给你们每个人一份礼物
...l give presents to you all.

426
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:11,029
工作愉快
Let us be happy in our work.

427
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:14,700
解散
Company, dismissed.

428
00:49:16,076 --> 00:49:19,580
全体解散
Battalion, dismissed.

429
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:36,388
嘿 看看
Hey, take a look at this.

430
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:39,308
红十字！ 他把我们的…
Red Cross! He's given us our...

431
00:49:39,558 --> 00:49:42,519
嘿 他把我方的红十字包裹发给我们
Hey, he's given us our own Red Cross parcels.

432
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:46,064
"明天重新开始"
"Tomorrow we begin again."

433
00:50:51,129 --> 00:50:52,547
嘿 哈里 看！
Hey, Harry, look!

434
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:55,592
他们要把老伙计放出来了
They're letting the old man out.

435
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:21,159
看来 他们要再毒打他一顿
Most likely going to give him another pasting.

436
00:52:05,453 --> 00:52:06,955
晚上好 上校
Good evening, colonel.

437
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,006
愿意过来坐一坐吗？
Do you mind sitting over here?

438
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,759
我晚饭还没有吃
I am having rather a late supper.

439
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:45,201
英国咸牛肉
English corned beef.

440
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:47,704
不用 谢谢
No, thank you.

441
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:55,545
产自苏格兰
Produce of Scotland.

442
00:52:57,255 --> 00:52:59,507
我宁愿它是日本米酒
I prefer it to sake.

443
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,677
我在伦敦呆了3年
I spent three years in London, you know.
I spent three years in London, you know.

444
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:06,598
我在伦敦工艺学校学习
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

445
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:09,559
敬你！
Cheers!

446
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:11,394
抱歉
Sorry.

447
00:53:11,644 --> 00:53:13,480
下次？
Later, perhaps?

448
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,357
也许
Perhaps.

449
00:53:20,945 --> 00:53:23,281
我不是一个好的艺术家
I was not a good artist.

450
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,825
我爸爸不赞成我搞艺术
My father disapproved.

451
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:28,495
他觉得我应该在军队发展
He felt I belonged in the army.

452
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:33,291
所以我放弃了艺术 改学工程
So I changed from art to engineering.

453
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,088
我必须告诉你 Saito上校
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

454
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:42,092
我要将你的行为写一份完整的报告
I intend to make a full report of your activities.

455
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:51,226
我不认为你理解我的处境
I do not think you quite realize my position.

456
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:55,021
- 我必须执行给我的命令 - 噢 当然
- I must carry out my orders. - Oh, quite, quite.

457
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:59,192
我必须在5月12号之前完成大桥
My orders are to complete the bridge by the 1 2th day of May.

458
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:02,112
- 我只有12个星期多一点 - 是的
- I have only 1 2 weeks more. - No doubt.

459
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:07,117
所以 我必须启用我手上的任何一个人
Therefore, I am compelled to use all available personnel.

460
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:10,203
军官不行 除非是管理工作
No officers, except for administration.

461
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:14,582
但是在这条铁路线上 所有的军官都在工作
But officers are working along the entire railway.

462
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,459
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it. I know it.

463
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:19,587
其他地方的军官我不管
I'm not responsible for other officers.

464
00:54:19,796 --> 00:54:21,297
从我个人来讲 我很震惊
Personally, I'm appalled.

465
00:54:21,506 --> 00:54:23,925
别激动
Let's not get excited.

466
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,057
来枝雪茄吗？
Will you have a cigar?

467
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:33,268
不 谢谢
No. Thank you.

468
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:38,773
当我说所有的指挥官都要劳动的时候…
When I said all officers must work...

469
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:42,443
…事实上是指少尉至上校阶级之各指挥官 并没有包括你
...naturally, I never meant you, the commanding officer.

470
00:54:42,694 --> 00:54:46,906
我的命令只适用于下级军官…
My orders were only intended for officers below...

471
00:54:47,115 --> 00:54:49,200
任何军官都不能做苦力劳动
No officers will do manual labour.

472
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,745
拜托！ 我是要说:
Please! I was about to say:

473
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:56,291
我通盘考虑过了
I've thought the matter over and have decided...

474
00:54:56,541 --> 00:55:01,004
…我要让他们大部分做管理工作
...to put majors and above on administrative duties...

475
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:04,007
…只有很低级的军官去劳动
...leaving only junior officers to work.

476
00:55:04,215 --> 00:55:07,802
不行 公约关于这个的规定很清楚
No. The Convention's quite clear on that point.

477
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:26,154
你知道如果大桥不能准时建成 我会怎样？
Do you know what will happen to me if the bridge is not ready in time?

478
00:55:26,404 --> 00:55:28,031
一点也不知道
I haven't the foggiest.

479
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,908
我必须自杀
I'd have to kill myself.

480
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:34,037
如果你是我 你会怎样？
What would you do if you were me?

481
00:55:34,537 --> 00:55:37,165
如果我是你…
I suppose if I were you...

482
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:40,084
…我想我会自杀
...l'd have to kill myself.

483
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:43,504
敬你
Cheers.

484
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:47,300
我警告你 上校…
I warn you, colonel...

485
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,013
…在我死之前 其他的人都得死
...if I am to die, others will die before me.

486
00:55:52,263 --> 00:55:53,514
你明白了吗？
Do you understand?

487
00:55:53,765 --> 00:55:56,392
科林普顿并没有这么说
Clipton did mention that.

488
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,103
但那样也不能解决你的问题
That won't solve your problem.

489
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:01,773
我想我们可以达成一个解决办法
I'm sure we can arrive at a solution.

490
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:03,650
请坐
Please sit down.

491
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:10,323
请你告诉我 上校…
Now. Tell me, colonel...

492
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:14,327
你认为军人的天职是服从命令吗？
...do you agree that the first job of an officer is command?

493
00:56:14,577 --> 00:56:16,454
- 当然 - 好的
- Of course. - Good.

494
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,208
现在
Now.

495
00:56:22,794 --> 00:56:24,712
我们来看看你的大桥
Take this bridge of yours.

496
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:27,632
真是一个巨大的工程
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

497
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,011
坦率地说 我怀疑你的那个叫什么来着的上尉…
Frankly, I doubt whether your Lieutenant what's- his- name...

498
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:34,097
三浦
Miura.

499
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:38,893
能胜任这样的工作
...is capable of tackling a job of such importance.

500
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:44,524
另外 我有些军官 比如里夫和休斯…
On the other hand, I have officers, Reeves and Hughes for instance...

501
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:48,486
…他们在印度到处修桥
...who have built bridges all over lndia.

502
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:51,197
人们都尊敬他们
The men respect them.

503
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:55,118
尊重对一个军官来说是很重要的
It's essential for an officer to have that respect.

504
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,495
如果没有尊重 则不能服众
If it's gone, he ceases to command.

505
00:56:57,745 --> 00:57:00,164
然后会怎么样？ 部下漫无纪律 指挥混乱
What then? Demoralization and chaos.

506
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:03,918
如果让这种情况发生 那么我就是个非常不称职的指挥官
A poor commander I would be if I allowed that to happen.

507
00:57:04,168 --> 00:57:09,298
也许你忘记了 修建大桥是由我来指挥的
Perhaps you are not aware that the bridge is now under my command.

508
00:57:09,632 --> 00:57:13,302
真的吗？ 你对进度满意吗？
Really? And may I ask, are you satisfied with the work?

509
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:15,847
- 很不满意！ - 你证明了我的观点
- I am not! - You've proved my point.

510
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:18,307
我痛恨英国人！
I hate the British!

511
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:21,686
你们被打败了 还不知羞耻
You are defeated but you have no shame.

512
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:24,355
你们很顽固 但没有什么值得自豪的
You are stubborn but have no pride.

513
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:27,608
你们会忍耐 但你们没有勇气
You endure but you have no courage.

514
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,610
我痛恨英国人！
I hate the British!

515
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:32,613
这样不能解决任何问题
Pointless, going on like this.

516
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:34,115
站着！
Stay there!

517
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:13,334
暂停！
Stand down. Stand down!

518
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:25,346
全体立正！
Battalion, attention!

519
01:02:05,344 --> 01:02:08,097
全体 稍息
Battalion, stand at ease.

520
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:12,142
请…
Please....

521
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:16,313
你知道今天是什么日子吗 上校？
Do you know what is the date today, colonel?

522
01:02:16,772 --> 01:02:18,273
我已经不会记数了
I've lost count.

523
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:21,318
这是我们1905年
It's the anniversary of our great victory...

524
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,279
大胜俄国人的纪念日…
...over Russia in 1 905.

525
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:28,659
整个东亚都在庆祝这个日子
Throughout East Asia we are celebrating this date.

526
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:30,744
趁着这个伟大的日子…
In honour of this occasion...

527
01:02:30,994 --> 01:02:33,706
…我给你的部下放了一天假
...l have given your troops a day of rest.

528
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:35,207
多谢
Many thanks.

529
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:38,460
我要宣布一个特赦
I am declaring a general amnesty.

530
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:42,214
你和你的军官可以回到你们的住处
You and your officers may return to your quarters.

531
01:02:42,464 --> 01:02:44,717
作为这个特赦的一部分…
As part of this amnesty...

532
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:50,222
…军官不需要做体力劳动了
...it will not be necessary for officers to do manual labour.

533
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,712
他做到了！
He's done it!

534
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,982
应该给某些人发勋章
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

535
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,579
你的手下有多少人？
How many men in your party?

536
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,789
我不是很清楚 长官
I don't really know, sir.

537
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,167
- 你不清楚？ - 通常有12个人
- You don't know? - Twelve, usually.

538
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,712
今早有一个生病了 长官
One of the men took sick this morning, sir.

539
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,299
有三四个人把他抬到医院去了
It took three or four to help him to the hospital.

540
01:06:14,176 --> 01:06:17,637
嗯 他病得很厉害 长官
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

541
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:21,600
一个下士必须清楚他管辖多少人
A corporal should know how many men he has under him.

542
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,102
是 长官
Oh, yes, sir.

543
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,690
你的面部神经有问题吗？ 否则 不要那样做鬼脸
Have you a nervous affliction? Stop making those faces.

544
01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:34,571
也许你认为很有趣 但不要那样做鬼脸
It may be funny to you, but it's not military behaviour.

545
01:06:34,821 --> 01:06:35,989
没有问题 长官
No, sir.

546
01:06:39,784 --> 01:06:42,454
我们必须停止这些作假行为
We must put a stop to these demonstrations.

547
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:54,758
- 我说 里夫？ - 什么 长官？
- I say, Reeves? - Yes, sir?

548
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:58,512
以前在这类河上修建过大桥吗？
Ever built a bridge over a stream like the Kwai?

549
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,307
是的 长官 我们在马德拉斯和孟加拉修的桥有半数是这类的
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them in Madras, Bengal....

550
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:04,559
如果这是你负责修建的大桥…
If this were your bridge...

551
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:07,479
你会怎样来做…？
...how would you get it under way?

552
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:11,274
怎样来做？
Get it under way, sir?

553
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:14,152
首先 我不会把它修在这里
First of all, I wouldn't build it here.

554
01:07:14,402 --> 01:07:16,571
噢 为什么？
Oh, why not?

555
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:18,365
我可以说…
I was trying to tell you...

556
01:07:18,615 --> 01:07:22,494
…小日本不可能再找到比这里糟糕的地点了
...the Japanese couldn't have picked a worse location.

557
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:25,205
你看到这些桥桩了吗？
You see those piles?

558
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:27,082
他们正在下沉
They're sinking.

559
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:33,338
他们要经常受到压力 而他们不可能支撑的住
We could drive those logs forever and they wouldn't hold.

560
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,632
那你会在哪里建桥？
Where would you build it?

561
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:39,844
下游较远一点的地方 长官 在那些河道狭窄的地方跨越河流
Further downstream, sir. Across those narrows.

562
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:42,931
这样两岸都会有坚实的岩床
Then we'd have solid bedrock on both banks.

563
01:07:43,515 --> 01:07:47,936
休斯 如果是你负责修建大桥 你会怎么安排人手？
Hughes, if this were your bridge, how would you use the men?

564
01:07:48,353 --> 01:07:52,440
绝对不是现在这样子 正如你看到的 太混乱了
Not the way they're doing it. It's chaos, as you can see.

565
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:56,486
作业互不协调
Uncoordinated activity.

566
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:58,363
相互没有配合
No teamwork.

567
01:07:59,906 --> 01:08:03,159
很多组的工作相互制约
Some parties are working against each other.

568
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:06,705
是的
Yes.

569
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:13,378
我说 先生们 我们手上有个难题
I say, gentlemen, we have a problem on our hands.

570
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:16,339
感谢小日本所赐 我们在指挥一群乌合之众
Thanks to the Japanese, we command a rabble.

571
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:19,009
没有秩序 没有原则
There's no order, no discipline.

572
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:23,430
- 我们的任务是要重组军队 - 是的 长官
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion. - Yes, sir.

573
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,515
那并不容易
Which isn't going to be easy.

574
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:29,269
幸运的是 我们手上有个对象 那座大桥
Fortunately, we have the means at hand. The bridge.

575
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:31,938
- 那座大桥 长官？ - 是的 那座大桥
- The bridge, sir? - The bridge.

576
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:39,029
我们要展示我们西方的效率 给他们上一课 让他们出出丑
We'll teach them a lesson in Western efficiency that'll put them to shame.

577
01:08:39,237 --> 01:08:41,948
展示我们英军士兵的能力
Show what a British soldier is capable of.

578
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:44,868
是的 长官 我明白你的意思
Yes. I see your point, sir.

579
01:08:45,076 --> 01:08:47,829
我知道这儿环境很艰苦…
I know how difficult it's going to be here...

580
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:50,540
…找不到合手的东西
...where you can't find what you need.

581
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,835
- 这是一个挑战 - 请原谅 长官
- There's the challenge. - I beg your pardon, sir.

582
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:56,588
你真的要给他们修一座大桥？
You really want them to build the bridge?

583
01:08:56,838 --> 01:08:59,466
你们平时可不是这么迟钝的
You're not usually so slow in the uptake.

584
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:02,635
我知道我们的战士 必须让他们有活干
I know our men. You've got to keep them occupied.

585
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:05,930
如果他们没有事干 我们就找一些给他们做
If there weren't any work, we'd invent some.

586
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:09,058
- 我们会的 长官 - 我们很幸运
- That we would, sir. - So we're lucky.

587
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:11,811
但是我们还要把它造好
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

588
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:14,189
我还知道我们的战士
Here again I know the men.

589
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:17,442
他们需要在工作中寻找自豪感
It's essential that they take pride in their job.

590
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,277
- 对不对 各位？ - 是的 长官
- Right, men? - Yes, sir.

591
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:22,405
里夫 你是这里的关键人员 你在这里要充当一个工程师
Reeves, you're the key man here as engineer.

592
01:09:22,655 --> 01:09:26,576
告诉我你需要的 我们会尽量去满足 我们能干好吗？
Tell me what you want and we'll get it. Can we make a go of it?

593
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:29,078
- 我们会干的很漂亮的 长官 - 很好
- We'll do out best, sir. - Fine.

594
01:09:30,205 --> 01:09:32,624
我们必须先制定计划…
We must draw up our plans...

595
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:35,960
…然后和Saito开个会议…
...then arrange a conference with Saito...

596
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:38,671
…然后纠正他的错误
...and set him straight.

597
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:47,430
那些全是程序上的事情
That takes care of all the procedural matters.

598
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:49,933
噢 是的
Oh, yes.

599
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:54,229
下面我要说的可能相关的人员会不高兴
The next point is unpleasant for all concerned, I'm afraid.

600
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:58,274
我不得不说 大桥的选址是草率的…
Sorry to say, the position of the bridge was fixed hastily...

601
01:09:58,483 --> 01:10:00,777
…嗯 或者说是错误的
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

602
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,656
错误的？
Incorrectly?

603
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,407
很不幸 是的
Unfortunately, yes.

604
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:09,369
我们的技术人员研究了你们选的地点…
Our engineer has made a study of the site...

605
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:12,956
…认为河床太软
...and decided that the river bottom there is too soft.

606
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,041
太软？
Too soft?

607
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,752
全是泥浆！ 所有的工作都是无用工
Mud! All the work has been useless.

608
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:19,420
- 里夫 请你继续 - 是的 长官
- Reeves, will you carry on? - Yes, sir.

609
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,005
- 里夫 请你继续 - 是的 长官
- Reeves, will you carry on? - Yes, sir.

610
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:26,427
桥墩的受力会把它们压到水面以下的
Those piles of yours could be hammered below water level before they'd hold.

611
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,472
当第一列火车通过的时候 大桥就会倒塌
It would collapse under the first train.

612
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:33,977
这是压力和泥土形变的图表 单位是吨/平方英寸
The pressure and soil resistance figures in tons per square inch.

613
01:10:34,185 --> 01:10:39,315
里夫 在你深入介绍之前… 上校 我们可以来杯茶吗？
Reeves, before you get too involved.... Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?

614
01:10:52,537 --> 01:10:56,499
我认为大家都同意了 为了避免灾难…
I take it we all agree that if we're to avoid disaster...

615
01:10:56,749 --> 01:11:01,879
…我们必须在下游400码的地方 在里夫挑选的地址上建一座新桥
...we build a new bridge, at the site picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.

616
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:07,302
现在我们来看下一个问题
Let's proceed to the next point.

617
01:11:07,302 --> 01:11:07,719
现在我们来看下一个问题
Let's proceed to the next point.

618
01:11:08,553 --> 01:11:11,264
我要改变他们的劳动强度
I decided to alter the work quota of our men.

619
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:13,182
- 改变劳动强度？ - 我要增加他们的劳动强度
- Alter? - I've increased it.

620
01:11:13,433 --> 01:11:15,977
从挖土15码改成2码
From 1 .5 yards of earth moved to two.

621
01:11:16,227 --> 01:11:18,980
你肯定会赞同这个决定
I'm sure it will meet with your approval.

622
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:22,525
休斯 你来详细介绍一下
Hughes has all the facts. Would you take over?

623
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:25,778
我仔细研究了一下整个工程
I've done a time study of the entire project.

624
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:29,866
我认为 作业分配是错误的
You see, the available forces have been badly distributed.

625
01:11:30,116 --> 01:11:33,828
我们应该修改作业分配
I'd urge we revise the organization of the working parties.

626
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:39,208
稍等一下 上校 我们边吃边谈可能会节约时间
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save time if we could work during dinner.

627
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:41,919
我们可以有晚饭吃的吧？
Would it be possible to have dinner?

628
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,379
当然
Of course.

629
01:11:46,924 --> 01:11:48,384
- 继续 - 是 长官
- Carry on. - Yes, sir.

630
01:11:48,593 --> 01:11:52,472
如果增加班组 细化分工…
If we increase the squads and specialize their functions...

631
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:57,060
…那么 每天的工作量会增加30%
...l'm certain the total daily output can be increased by 30?0 .

632
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:00,480
现在 Saito 上校 我还有一点补充…
Now, Colonel Saito, I have one more point....

633
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:06,319
现在 还有一项决定刻不容缓
Now, there's another important decision that can't be postponed.

634
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:08,821
当英军士兵在修桥的时候…
As the British will work on the bridge...

635
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:11,991
…修建铁路的人手就少了
...only a few will be available for railway work.

636
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:17,163
你必须用你的人来支援铁路的修建…
I must ask you to lend us some of your men to reinforce the railway gang...

637
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:21,959
…那样 铺轨的工作也能尽快的完成
...so the final stretch of track can be completed as quickly as possible.

638
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:25,505
我已经下令了
I have already given the order.

639
01:12:25,755 --> 01:12:28,841
我们也必须改变你们的工作强度
We must fix the daily work quota for your men.

640
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:33,012
我曾想过定为每天15码 这样不会太过疲劳…
I thought to set it at 1 .5 yards so as not to overtire them...

641
01:12:33,262 --> 01:12:35,973
…但是和我们一样是不是更好一些？
...but isn't it best to be the same as ours?

642
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:39,477
这样也会形成良性竞争
That would also create a healthy competitive spirit.

643
01:12:41,395 --> 01:12:44,649
我已经下令了
I have already given the order.

644
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:47,443
我们会尽善尽美的 对不对 休斯？
We'll try to surpass that, won't we, Hughes?

645
01:12:47,693 --> 01:12:50,655
我想今晚的议程就到这里
I think that completes the agenda for tonight.

646
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:54,325
谢谢你的关注 Saito上校
Thank you, Colonel Saito, for your kind attention.

647
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:57,453
还有问题吗？
Are there any other questions?

648
01:12:58,913 --> 01:13:00,540
我有一个问题
One question.

649
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:03,709
你能在期限内完成大桥吗？
Can you finish the bridge in time?

650
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,463
坦率地讲 看起来是不可能的
Frankly, the consensus of opinion is that it's impossible.

651
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:10,132
当然我们要试一试
But we'll certainly give it a go.

652
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:15,680
别忘了 我们因为分歧而浪费了一个月…
Don't forget we wasted a month through an unfortunate disagreement...

653
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,765
…当然那不是我的错
...for which I was not to blame.

654
01:13:19,392 --> 01:13:21,185
还有什么问题吗？
Is there anything else?

655
01:13:21,978 --> 01:13:23,062
没有了
No.

656
01:13:23,688 --> 01:13:27,650
谢谢 会议结束
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

657
01:13:28,776 --> 01:13:31,404
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

658
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:59,974
我希望这些小日本会感激我们所做的
I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.

659
01:14:00,683 --> 01:14:03,936
虽然现在我还没有感觉到这一点
For now I'm not concerned with their appreciation.

660
01:14:04,729 --> 01:14:07,481
- 晚安 科林普顿 - 晚安 长官
- Good night, Clipton. - Good night, sir.

661
01:14:09,608 --> 01:14:11,694
另外 我想告诉你…
By the way, I meant to tell you...

662
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:14,780
…这里有一些树比较象榆树
...there are trees here similar to elm.

663
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:18,951
伦敦桥的榆树桩已经支撑了600年了
And the elm piles of London Bridge lasted 600 years.

664
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:22,288
- 600年 里夫？ - 是的 长官
- Six hundred years, Reeves? - Yes, sir.

665
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:25,624
600年
Six hundred years.

666
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:28,336
真是奇迹
That would be quite something.

667
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:21,138
我在找一个美国人 他叫 舍尔斯
I'm looking for an American named Commander Shears.

668
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:24,642
- 在海滩上 - 谢谢
- Yes, down on the beach. - Oh, thank you very much.

669
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:33,609
吻一下！
Kiss!

670
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:35,569
那么多人
Too many eyes.

671
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:36,320
那么多人
Too many eyes.

672
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:40,699
你给了我药粉 药片 沐浴 注射 灌肠…
You give me powders, pills, baths, injections, enemas....

673
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:42,409
其实我只需要爱
All I need is love.

674
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:45,496
是的 你只需要爱
It's true. All you really need is love.

675
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:53,420
为什么你这么肯定你想病休？
Why are you so sure you'll get a medical discharge?

676
01:15:53,671 --> 01:15:55,965
因为我内心里一直是老百姓 宝贝
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover.

677
01:15:56,215 --> 01:15:58,342
而且我一直是性情中人
And I always follow my heart.

678
01:15:58,592 --> 01:15:59,885
吻一下
Kiss.

679
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,521
怎么会那样 司令官？
How's that, commander?

680
01:16:11,564 --> 01:16:13,232
不要叫我司令官
Don't call me commander.

681
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,817
太不浪漫了
It's unromantic.

682
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:16,777
你自己也是个军官
You're an officer yourself.

683
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:19,947
你会喜欢我叫你宝贝上尉吗？
How'd you like it if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

684
01:16:20,197 --> 01:16:22,658
让我们用平民的称呼吧 就叫我"先生"吧
Let's be democratic. Just call me "sir."

685
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:23,993
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

686
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,329
厚颜无耻
Brass ahoy.

687
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,915
他来找你
He wants you. He's all yours.

688
01:16:30,124 --> 01:16:32,626
- 我要去游泳了 - 别走！
- I'm going for a swim. - Don't leave me!

689
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:35,796
- 舍尔斯 司令官？ - 是的
- Commander Shears? - Yes.

690
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:37,840
我叫 华登
My name's Warden.

691
01:16:38,215 --> 01:16:39,842
- 你好 - 对不起 打扰了…
- How do you do? - Sorry to intrude...

692
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:42,553
没事 少校 我习惯了
That's okay, major. I'm used to it.

693
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:43,804
来点马丁尼酒吗？
Like a martini?

694
01:16:44,054 --> 01:16:45,806
谢谢 不用了
That's very kind. I think not.

695
01:16:46,056 --> 01:16:47,224
介意我来一点吗？
Mind if I have one?

696
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:48,809
哪里搞来的？
How did you get that?

697
01:16:49,059 --> 01:16:52,438
有医院就有酒精
Where there's a hospital, there's alcohol.

698
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:55,149
噢 那当然
Yes, of course. Jolly good.

699
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:58,068
嗯 我尽量简洁一些
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

700
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:01,864
我隶属于316部队 那是个比较古怪的部门
I belong to a rather rum group called Force 31 6.

701
01:17:02,114 --> 01:17:04,575
我们的总部在布坦尼可公园 (Botanical Gardens(植物园))
Our headquarters is in the Botanical Gardens.

702
01:17:04,825 --> 01:17:08,078
- 保护稀有植物不被敌人破坏？ - 当然不是
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy? - Not quite.

703
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,206
- 你当真不来一点？ - 不 谢谢
- Sure you won't have one? - No, thanks.

704
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:15,377
我们对你工作过的铁路很感兴趣
We have an interest in that railway you worked on.

705
01:17:15,628 --> 01:17:18,922
你可以给我们很多有价值的情报
You could give us no end of valuable information.

706
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:22,676
嗯 我已经离开那地方已经很多天了…
Well, I'm leaving for the States in a few days...

707
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:26,013
…而且我把所知的都告诉你们了
...and I told your people everything I know.

708
01:17:26,263 --> 01:17:29,600
但是你可以用一种更特殊的方式来帮助我们
But you could help us in a rather special sense.

709
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:34,980
我知道有点强人所难 但是你能否出来去见一下我们？
I know it's a terrible imposition, but could you possibly come out and see us?

710
01:17:36,482 --> 01:17:39,401
如果你想让我再重复报告一遍的话
If you want to go over the whole thing again.

711
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:42,321
太好了 路易斯阁下会感激不尽的
Very kind. Lord Louis'll be grateful.

712
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:43,781
- 谁？ - 蒙巴顿
- Who? - Mountbatten.

713
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:46,658
我们是他的部下
We're one of his special pigeons.

714
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:50,621
那么今晚怎么样？ 8点我会派一辆车来
Shall we say this evening, then? About 8. I'll send a car.

715
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:52,915
今晚？ 不行
This evening? Out of the question.

716
01:17:53,165 --> 01:17:55,417
你明早怎么样？ 10点？
Tomorrow morning then? About 1 0?

717
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:58,170
- 好 就10点 - 多谢
- Okay, 1 0:00. - Thanks very much.

718
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,631
- 再见 - 再见
- Cheerio. - Cheerio.

719
01:18:00,839 --> 01:18:02,091
祝你好运
Good luck.

720
01:18:03,008 --> 01:18:04,176
谢谢
Thanks.

721
01:18:12,184 --> 01:18:16,063
你很抱歉 你今晚要让我空等了
You're sorry, but you're going to stand me up tonight.

722
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:18,357
大错特错
You couldn't be more wrong.

723
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:24,530
敬礼！
General salute!

724
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,364
敬礼！
General salute!

725
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:27,366
举枪致敬！
Present arms!

726
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:44,007
- 可以看你的通行证吗？ - 好的
- May I see your pass, please? - Oh, yes.

727
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,857
华登少校的办公室在路的尽头
Major Warden's bungalow is at the end of the path.

728
01:19:11,702 --> 01:19:15,080
干得好 Jenkins 干得好！
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

729
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:18,834
快 汤姆森用你的匕首
Come along, Thomson. Use your knife, man.

730
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,796
站起来！快去指定地点
On your feet! Away to the debriefing room.

731
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,256
站起来！快去指定地点
On your feet! Away to the debriefing room.

732
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:26,967
快 快点！
Come on, move yourselves! Move quickly!

733
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:33,640
动作太笨了 乔依斯
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

734
01:19:34,892 --> 01:19:37,853
要立即用匕首捅 乔依斯
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.

735
01:19:38,103 --> 01:19:40,731
你看 他占了主动
You see, he's gained the initiative.

736
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:44,735
停下！ 对不起 长官
Wait a minute! I'm terribly sorry, sir.

737
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:47,195
- 你对不起？ - 是的
- You're sorry? - So am l.

738
01:19:47,446 --> 01:19:50,741
- 我以为你是敌人 - 我是美国人 如果你是指这个的话
- I thought you were the enemy. - I'm American, if that's what you mean.

739
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:54,911
- 就这样 乔依斯 - 是 长官 对不起 长官
- That'll be all, Joyce. - Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

740
01:19:55,954 --> 01:19:59,291
- 我能做什么？ - 我要找华登上校
- What can I do for you? - I'm going to see Major Warden.

741
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:03,170
我来带路 他现在应该快下课了
I'll show you the way. He'll finish his lecture any moment now.

742
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:03,879
我来带路 他现在应该快下课了
I'll show you the way. He'll finish his lecture any moment now.

743
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:13,263
- 他现在下课了 - 这么大的声音
- That's the end of his lecture. - Thunderous ovation.

744
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,643
他认为训练越接近实战越好
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.
He believes in keeping our training as close to real life as possible.

745
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:22,230
- 华登少校 - 嗯？
- Major Warden, sir? - Yes?

746
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,899
很高兴见到你
Good of you to come.

747
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:26,860
- 他们待你还好吧？ - 确实是的
- They took care of you? - They certainly have.

748
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,197
谢谢你 跟我来
Thank you, staff. Well, come along, then.

749
01:20:30,447 --> 01:20:33,283
格林上校要见你
Col. Green is looking forward to meeting you.

750
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:39,831
- 这个地方还不错吧？ - 我不知道这里还是一所军事学校
- Fascinating place, isn't it? - Didn't know it was a commando school.

751
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:44,961
我们尽量不用这种称呼 那样会制造紧张空气
We're trying to discourage the use of that word. Such a melodramatic air.

752
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:46,630
你在这里干什么？
What do you do here?

753
01:20:46,838 --> 01:20:49,257
爆破 摧毁一类的事情
Sabotage, demolition, that line of country.

754
01:20:49,508 --> 01:20:52,511
我们使用 PE 塑胶炸药 很不错的东西
We're using P.E., plastic explosives. It's wonderful.

755
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:55,389
刚才那个爆炸的炸药只有这个一半大
That pop was made with a lump half this size.

756
01:20:55,639 --> 01:20:59,101
只要硝化甘油炸药的一半 而威力却有两倍
It's twice as powerful as gelignite at half the weight.

757
01:21:00,352 --> 01:21:03,313
没引爆的情况下是很安全的
It's quite harmless until it's detonated.

758
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:05,190
谢谢你的介绍
Thanks for telling me.

759
01:21:05,399 --> 01:21:08,860
它完全防水 而且可塑性很好
It's completely waterproof and actually plastic.

760
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,277
看到吗？你可以用它来做你想用它做的事情
See? You can do what you like with it.

761
01:21:12,153 --> 01:21:13,780
这是我的办公室
This is my place.

762
01:21:19,245 --> 01:21:20,663
这里
Go ahead.

763
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:24,928
喔 渴死了 我要来杯茶
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

764
01:21:27,347 --> 01:21:29,599
- 你也来一杯？ - 不 谢谢
- Would you care for one? - No, thanks.

765
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:32,019
- 来杯酒？ - 不 谢谢
- A drink? - No, thank you.

766
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:35,356
- 给我来壶茶 彼得 - 是的 长官
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter. - Very good, sir.

767
01:21:39,278 --> 01:21:40,612
这个你也看得懂？
Do you read this?

768
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:44,741
战前 我在剑桥教东方语言
I taught Oriental languages at Cambridge before the war.

769
01:21:48,663 --> 01:21:52,250
我还没有祝贺你的成功逃亡呢 干得好！
I never congratulated you on your escape. Good show!

770
01:21:52,459 --> 01:21:56,337
如果你的海上救援飞机没有看到我 我也不会呆在这里
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

771
01:21:56,589 --> 01:21:58,299
是的 我想不会
No, I suppose not.

772
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,138
你愿意再来看看你逃出来的地方吗？
Would you like to see where you were?

773
01:22:05,097 --> 01:22:06,015
好的
All right.

774
01:22:07,726 --> 01:22:11,271
我们的情报很有限 主要来源于你的报告
Our information's scanty. It's based on your report.

775
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:13,315
我们认为战俘营在这里
We think the camp's here.

776
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:17,402
你们是否有尼科尔森上校的消息？
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?
Do your people have any idea what happened to Col. Nicholson?

777
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:21,699
他很勇敢 要枪毙他时 他也不眨一下眼睛
He had guts. They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

778
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:25,119
当你要被枪毙的时候 你本来就什么也不能做
If you're about to be shot there's not much you can do.

779
01:22:25,495 --> 01:22:29,833
这里是桂河 这里是你求助的村子
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.
Here is the river Kwai, and here's the village where you were helped.

780
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:31,668
这里是铁路
Here is the railway.

781
01:22:31,877 --> 01:22:34,588
你肯定非常熟悉这一带
You must be fairly familiar with this area.

782
01:22:34,797 --> 01:22:37,342
不 大部分时间我脑袋里只是一片空白
No, I was out of my head half the time.

783
01:22:37,592 --> 01:22:41,179
铁路从新加坡开始 经过马来西亚…
The railway starts down here in Singapore. Malaya...

784
01:22:41,429 --> 01:22:46,309
…曼谷 仰光 他们想一直贯通到印度
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea is to drive on through, into lndia.

785
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,022
- 我是在哪里被救起的？ - 在这里附近
- Where was I picked up? - Oh, about here.

786
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:55,236
日军想在五月中旬贯通曼谷和仰光
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-  Rangoon section by the middle of May.

787
01:22:55,528 --> 01:22:57,572
我们必须阻止他们
We'll try to prevent them.
We'll try to prevent them.

788
01:22:57,822 --> 01:23:00,659
太远了 轰炸机飞不到这里
It's too far for bombers to carry a load.

789
01:23:00,867 --> 01:23:03,203
我们必须用地面部队把它摧毁
We'll have to go smash it on the ground.

790
01:23:03,454 --> 01:23:06,082
- 那你想怎么办？ - 空降之后 徒步到那里
- How? - Parachute drop, then march.

791
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:09,210
带着爆破装置穿过雨林吗？
With demolition equipment through that jungle?

792
01:23:09,835 --> 01:23:13,839
我们的主要问题是对那里一无所知
Our chief problem is lack of firsthand knowledge.

793
01:23:14,091 --> 01:23:16,635
我们没有人到过哪里
You see, none of us have ever been there.

794
01:23:16,885 --> 01:23:20,097
- 我其实不想让你失望 但是… - 那很有趣
- I don't want to discourage... - It should be interesting.

795
01:23:20,347 --> 01:23:25,268
格林上校把桂河大桥交给我了 我要带一队人去炸掉它
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge. I'm taking a team in to blow it up.

796
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:27,563
你真幸运
Lucky you.

797
01:23:30,275 --> 01:23:31,735
你真的不想来点茶？
Sure you won't have tea?

798
01:23:31,944 --> 01:23:36,532
不 谢谢 我不想失礼 但是我在2点钟要和一个漂亮的姑娘约会
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude, but I've got a date at 2.

799
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:40,494
- 如果还有问题的话… - 很抱歉 是的
- If there are any questions.... - Of course, I'm sorry.

800
01:23:43,248 --> 01:23:46,334
嗯 只有一个问题
Well, there is only one question, actually.

801
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:49,045
你觉得再去哪里一趟怎么样？
How would you feel about going back?

802
01:23:51,382 --> 01:23:52,341
什么？
Come again?

803
01:23:53,509 --> 01:23:56,220
在某种情况下 有点儿…
Under the circumstances it's a bit much...

804
01:23:56,429 --> 01:23:59,598
…但是你是我们完成这个任务的关键
...but you have a unique knowledge for our purpose.

805
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,643
我们很希望你能和我们一起去
We'd love to have you with us.

806
01:24:03,812 --> 01:24:05,981
这就是你找我来这里的原因？
That's why you brought me here?

807
01:24:06,231 --> 01:24:07,733
来请我再去哪里一趟？
To ask me this?

808
01:24:07,984 --> 01:24:09,694
嗯 坦率的说 是的
Well, frankly, yes.

809
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:11,612
我才从那里逃出来
I just got out of there.

810
01:24:11,863 --> 01:24:15,950
我能从那里逃出来 简直是个奇迹 而你现在却让我再回去！ 真荒唐！
My escape was a miracle. Now you want me to go back! Ridiculous!

811
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,452
我知道这很令人为难…
This is embarrassing...

812
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:21,373
我不属于你们的部队 我隶属于美国海军
I don't belong to you. I belong to the American Navy.

813
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:25,544
事实上 格林上校和你的部队讨论过这件事
Actually, Col. Green has taken the matter up with your people.

814
01:24:25,753 --> 01:24:29,590
- 和我的部队？ - 你的海军把你转借给我们
- With my people? - Your Navy's turned you over to us.

815
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:33,595
昨天早上 从太平洋舰队指挥部来了一个命令…
A signal arrived yesterday morning from the Pacific...

816
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:37,891
确认把你暂借给316部队
...authorizing your temporary transfer of duty to Force 31 6.

817
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,936
- 他们不能这样做！ - 恐怕他们不这样认为
- They can't do this! - I'm afraid they have.

818
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:43,939
很遗憾告诉你这个消息
It was hard to break it to you.

819
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:48,694
但是他们不能这样对我 海军搞错了！
But they can't do this to me. I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake!

820
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:56,620
你看 我不是海军司令官 我甚至不是一名军官
Look. I'm not a Navy commander. I'm not even an officer.
Look. I'm not a Navy commander. I'm not even an officer.

821
01:24:56,913 --> 01:25:02,043
整个事情都不是真的 我只是一个擦炮筒的普通士兵
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

822
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:08,634
当休斯顿号沉没的时候 我和一名真正的司令官上岸
When the Houston sunk, I made it ashore with a real commander.

823
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:12,054
我们碰上了日军巡逻队 他被打死了
We ran into a Japanese patrol. He was killed.

824
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:15,599
我认为只是时间问题 直到我…
I figured it was just a matter of time till l...

825
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,686
所以你和死人换了服装
So you changed uniforms with a dead man.

826
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:22,899
我认为在战俘营中军官会受到较好的待遇
I thought officers would get better treatment in prison camps.

827
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:26,737
但是我遇到的Saito 他命令指挥官和其他人一起劳动
But with Saito, the officers worked along with the rest.

828
01:25:26,987 --> 01:25:29,532
总是有意想不到的事情 对不对？
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

829
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:35,037
我已经有点习惯当司令官了…
I kind of got used to being a commander...

830
01:25:35,288 --> 01:25:37,541
…所以当我来到医院的时候…
...so when I arrived at the hospital...

831
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:42,921
…我看了一下普通战士的病房和指挥官的病房…
...l took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward...

832
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:47,760
…然后我对自己说 "就继续冒充一些时间吧"
...and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."

833
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,720
军官还真有优待
There were certain advantages.

834
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:51,806
我在海滩上就看到一个
I saw one of them on the beach.

835
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:54,226
这就是整个故事
That's the whole story.

836
01:25:54,476 --> 01:25:58,397
问题是 你不能用我 你需要的是一名指挥官…
The point is, you can't use me. You want an officer...

837
01:25:58,647 --> 01:26:01,525
…一个并不存在的美军司令官舍尔斯
...an American Commander Shears who doesn't exist.

838
01:26:01,776 --> 01:26:04,237
当海军发现了真相 他们会说:
When the Navy learns the truth, they'll say:

839
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:07,282
"由于假扮指挥官 把他遣送回家"
"Ship him home for impersonating an officer."

840
01:26:08,032 --> 01:26:11,077
- 一旦结果是那样 我就成功了 - 你就怎样？
- Once that happens, I've got it made. - Got it what?

841
01:26:11,328 --> 01:26:13,789
成功了！ 我现在想喝点酒
Made! I'd like that drink now.

842
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,293
我想申请病退
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

843
01:26:17,543 --> 01:26:22,464
我会说假装指挥官是由于在森林中得了神经病
I'll say I impersonated an officer because I went crazy in the jungle.

844
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:27,762
甚至 有时我觉得我是海尔森海军舰队司令
I'm getting worse. Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

845
01:26:28,514 --> 01:26:30,224
很聪明的计划
It's quite a clever plan.

846
01:26:31,309 --> 01:26:33,561
不仅仅是是聪明的计划 而且是简单安全的
Not only clever, it's foolproof.

847
01:26:33,811 --> 01:26:36,147
如果海军发现了我的真实身份
If my Navy finds out who I am...

848
01:26:36,397 --> 01:26:40,401
那份命令就是一张废纸
...those orders won't be worth the paper they're written on.

849
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,002
这是你的照片吗？
Isn't this your photograph?

850
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,717
- 从哪里搞到的？ - 由于你的部队不能确认你的身份…
- Where did you get this? - It took some doing...

851
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,386
…就费了些事
...since your people couldn't identify you.

852
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:09,433
最后你的太平洋舰队发了一份你的服役档案过来
Finally your C- in- C Pacific sent us a copy of your service record.

853
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:13,688
照片和指纹 你愿意看看吗？
The photograph, fingerprints. Would you care to have a look?

854
01:27:15,775 --> 01:27:20,029
我们知道你的真实身份已经有一个星期了
You see, we've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.

855
01:27:22,948 --> 01:27:25,493
你的海军处在一个两难的境地
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

856
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:27,954
一方面你是个英雄…
In one sense you're a hero...
In one sense you're a hero...

857
01:27:28,205 --> 01:27:30,874
…成功逃出雨林
...for making an escape from the jungle.

858
01:27:31,082 --> 01:27:34,044
同时 因为你假扮指挥官
At the same time, they can't bring you home...

859
01:27:34,253 --> 01:27:37,757
他们又不好把你送回家 然后颁发一枚海军十字勋章给你
...and give you the Navy Cross for impersonating an officer.

860
01:27:37,965 --> 01:27:41,344
我想因此他们很乐意把你转交给我们
I suppose that's why they were happy to hand you over.

861
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:43,179
你明白了吗？
You see?

862
01:27:43,387 --> 01:27:44,514
棘手的问题
Hot potato.

863
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:47,768
说到你的军阶
As far as your rank is concerned...

864
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:51,146
在316部队 我们并不在意那个
...we're fairly informal about that in Force 31 6.

865
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:53,774
你可以假装你是少校
You'd have the simulated rank of major.

866
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:58,822
假装上校 那意味着…
A simulated major. That figures.

867
01:28:00,365 --> 01:28:01,741
嗯…
Well....

868
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:08,374
我最好是志愿参加
As long as I'm hooked, I might as well volunteer.

869
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,584
很好！
Good show!

870
01:28:12,045 --> 01:28:13,755
格林上校 长官
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

871
01:28:14,005 --> 01:28:19,135
这是舍尔斯上校 他志愿帮助我们炸掉那座桥
This is Major Shears. He volunteered to go and help me blow up the bridge.

872
01:28:19,553 --> 01:28:20,929
真的？
Really?

873
01:28:22,014 --> 01:28:23,683
很好！
Good show!

874
01:28:23,933 --> 01:28:26,769
太好了 上校！
Jolly good show, major!

875
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:18,993
去医务室吧 这只脚感染了
Get up to sick bay. This foot's infected.

876
01:29:19,244 --> 01:29:21,330
上校会以为我在装病
Colonel might think I'm malingering.

877
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:24,333
我是医疗官快去吧！
I'm the medical officer. Get cracking!

878
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:33,926
有人愿意告诉我为什么他想建一座真的大桥吗？
Will someone tell me why he wants to build a proper bridge?

879
01:29:34,177 --> 01:29:37,680
不要担心老尼克他知道自己在干什么
Don't worry about old Nick. He knows what he's doing.

880
01:29:48,109 --> 01:29:52,280
嘿 柯林普顿该给我们展示一下了
Hello, Clipton. About time you paid us a visit.

881
01:29:52,989 --> 01:29:55,116
我们的小伙子干得真不错
Fine job our chaps are doing.

882
01:29:55,368 --> 01:29:57,703
是的 他怎么样？
Yes. How's he behaving?

883
01:29:57,953 --> 01:30:00,664
当我们接管过来以后 他已经变得很讲理了
He's been most reasonable since we took over.

884
01:30:00,915 --> 01:30:03,793
- 他在想什么？ - 我不清楚
- What's he thinking? - I haven't the foggiest.

885
01:30:04,043 --> 01:30:06,045
- 谢谢你 里夫 - 好的 长官
- Thanks, Reeves. - Right, sir.

886
01:30:06,755 --> 01:30:08,131
你怎么看？
What do you think?

887
01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:11,676
绝对是个挑战 对不对？
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

888
01:30:13,846 --> 01:30:18,184
你真认为建这座桥是个好主意吗？
Are you convinced that building this bridge is a good idea?

889
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:20,019
- 你是认真的吗？ - 是的 长官
- Are you serious? - Yes, sir.

890
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:23,981
一个好主意吗？ 我们再看看
A good idea? Take another look.

891
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,821
你不认为他们士气很高吗？ 你不认为军纪又得到恢复了吗？
You don't agree morale is high? Discipline has been restored?

892
01:30:29,071 --> 01:30:31,115
你不认为他们的待遇得到提高了吗？
Their condition has improved?

893
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:33,909
他们难道没有更快乐了一些了吗？
Are they a happier lot or aren't they?

894
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,539
他们吃得也好了 再也得不到虐待
They feed better and they are no longer abused.

895
01:30:37,789 --> 01:30:41,960
坦率地说 柯林普顿 有时我一点也不了解你
Honestly, Clipton, there are times when I don't understand you at all.

896
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:44,130
让我说得更清楚一些
I'll try to make myself clear.

897
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,259
事实上 我们所作的事情可以被理解为…
The fact is, what we're doing could be construed as...

898
01:30:48,467 --> 01:30:51,512
…对不起 长官 是通敌合作
...forgive me, sir, collaboration with the enemy.

899
01:30:51,763 --> 01:30:53,390
甚至可以被认为是叛国罪
Perhaps even treason.

900
01:30:53,598 --> 01:30:57,686
我们是战俘 我们没有权利拒绝劳动
We're prisoners of war. We haven't the right to refuse to work.

901
01:30:58,061 --> 01:31:01,147
我知道 长官 但是我们一定要做得这么好吗？
I understand that, sir. But must we work so well?
I understand that, sir. But must we work so well?

902
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:04,443
我们一定要做得比他们自己还好吗？
Must we do better than they could themselves?

903
01:31:05,486 --> 01:31:09,866
如果你替Saito做手术 你是会尽力治好他还是杀死他？
If you had to operate on Saito, would you do your best or let him die?

904
01:31:10,868 --> 01:31:13,662
你难道不认为懒散会击垮我们？
Would you prefer we disintegrate in idleness?

905
01:31:13,912 --> 01:31:16,748
让世人说我们连一件正常的工作都不会做？
Or have it said we can't do a proper job?

906
01:31:16,957 --> 01:31:21,962
这很重要 要让他们知道 他们不可能在身体或精神上打垮我们
It's important to show them they can't break us in body or in spirit.

907
01:31:22,255 --> 01:31:24,465
好好看看 柯林普顿
Take a good look, Clipton.

908
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,385
有一天 当战争结束
One day the war will be over.

909
01:31:27,594 --> 01:31:30,847
我希望将来那些使用这座桥的人…
I hope that those who use the bridge in years to come...

910
01:31:31,098 --> 01:31:34,310
…会记住它是怎么样被建成的 是谁修建了他们
...will remember how it was built, and who built it.

911
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,690
不是一群奴隶 而是一群战士 是一群英国战士 甚至是在被俘的情况下修建的
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers. British soldiers, even in captivity.

912
01:31:40,108 --> 01:31:42,444
- 是的 长官 - 你是一个好医生
- Yes, sir. - You're a fine doctor...

913
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:45,530
但是对于战争 你还要学习很多
...but you've a lot to learn about the army.

914
01:32:09,265 --> 01:32:10,808
抓住他！ 抓住他！
Hold him! Hold him!

915
01:32:11,059 --> 01:32:15,146
用脚！
Use your boot! Get your boot in there, will you?

916
01:32:22,446 --> 01:32:23,906
早上好！
Good morning!

917
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,591
你们到底在看什么？
What on earth are you people staring at?

918
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:45,388
用脚踹倒他！
Get him with your boot!

919
01:32:57,985 --> 01:32:59,487
对不起我来迟了 长官
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

920
01:32:59,737 --> 01:33:03,574
迟到4分钟 你在做内科检查吗？
Four minutes, to be exact. You were in need of medical attention?

921
01:33:03,826 --> 01:33:06,453
- 对不起 长官？ - 我是指那个女护士
- Sir? - I was referring to the nurse.

922
01:33:07,413 --> 01:33:10,040
足智多谋 华登 说的一点也不错
Very ingenious. Warden was right.

923
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:11,667
请坐
Sit down.

924
01:33:12,377 --> 01:33:16,714
我请你来这里 是要你挑选行动小组里的第四个人
I asked you here to help us pick the fourth member of your team.

925
01:33:16,965 --> 01:33:19,634
- 请乔伊斯先生进来 - 是的 长官
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in. - Yes, sir.

926
01:33:20,301 --> 01:33:23,054
查普曼想要乔伊斯 但是我有疑虑
Chapman wants Joyce, but I have my doubts.

927
01:33:23,305 --> 01:33:27,101
他有太多的想象力了
He has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.

928
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,394
我已经告诉过你…
I've told you...

929
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:33,065
…在这个任务中 总会有万一
...in this job, even when it's finished there's always one more thing to do.

930
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,694
他在学校里是游泳最好的
He's the best swimmer in the school.

931
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:40,240
我早已清楚你的观点 我现在要舍尔斯的意见
I'm well aware of your evaluation. The opinion I want is Shears'.

932
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:45,663
好的 稍息
All right, at ease.

933
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:54,089
这些人想带你到雨林一游
These men are thinking of taking you for a hike in the jungle.

934
01:33:54,339 --> 01:33:55,674
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

935
01:33:56,341 --> 01:33:58,594
你在蒙特利尔是个会计师？
You were an accountant in Montreal?

936
01:33:58,844 --> 01:34:01,013
是的 长官 但还不是个正式的会计师
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant.

937
01:34:01,264 --> 01:34:03,391
因为我还没有得到许可证
That is, I didn't have my charter.

938
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,018
那么你实际上做什么呢？
Exactly what did you do?

939
01:34:05,268 --> 01:34:09,230
嗯 长官 我只是核算数据…
Well, sir, I just checked columns and columns of figures...

940
01:34:09,481 --> 01:34:11,942
…核算那些别人核算过的数据…
...which people had checked before me...

941
01:34:12,151 --> 01:34:15,613
…然后别人再核算我核算过的数据
...and other people checked them after I had checked them.

942
01:34:15,863 --> 01:34:19,074
- 听起来很烦人 - 长官 是很烦人
- Sounds a frightful bore. - Sir, it was a bore.

943
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:20,911
你怎么会在这里的？
How did you wind up here?

944
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:26,249
1939年 我去伦敦应征 后来 我志愿来到这里
In '39 I came over to London to enlist. Later I volunteered for this work.

945
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:30,253
- 你是志愿的！ - 是的 长官 你看 正规部队…
- You volunteered! - Yes, sir. See, the regular Army...

946
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,131
请继续 你可以很坦率地说
Go ahead, you can be frank.

947
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:37,637
嗯 正规部队使我回想起我原来的工作
Well, the regular Army reminded me of my job in civilian life.

948
01:34:37,888 --> 01:34:40,098
他们不需要你去思考
They don't expect you to think.

949
01:34:42,392 --> 01:34:44,061
那你思考这个看看
Think about this.

950
01:34:44,353 --> 01:34:47,314
你能用它来杀人吗？
Are you sure you'd be able to use it in cold blood?

951
01:34:47,774 --> 01:34:49,067
我知道怎么使用它
I know how to use it.

952
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:53,321
不是那意思 我问你能用它来杀人吗？
That's not what I meant. Could you use it in cold blood?

953
01:34:53,571 --> 01:34:55,949
你可以毫不犹豫地杀人吗？
Could you kill without hesitation?

954
01:34:56,992 --> 01:35:02,122
这个问题我曾经问过自己 它很困扰我
That's a question I've asked myself. It's worried me quite a bit.

955
01:35:02,581 --> 01:35:04,291
那么答案是什么？
And what was the answer?

956
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,794
事实上 我并不知道答案 长官
I don't honestly know, sir.

957
01:35:07,504 --> 01:35:10,131
我曾经试图想象自己…
I've tried to imagine myself....

958
01:35:11,966 --> 01:35:15,970
我很难使自己相信杀戮不是犯罪
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself that killing isn't a crime.

959
01:35:16,681 --> 01:35:18,641
那是军队里的一个古老的问题
It's an old army problem.

960
01:35:19,266 --> 01:35:22,436
嗯 好了 谢谢你 乔伊斯
Well, I think that's all. Thank you, Joyce.

961
01:35:25,023 --> 01:35:26,483
我可以参加行动了吗？
Am I to go with the team?

962
01:35:27,984 --> 01:35:29,277
我们会让你知道的
We'll let you know.

963
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:38,079
你们看到了吧
You see what I mean.

964
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:40,206
嗯 至少他是诚实的
Well, at least he was honest.

965
01:35:40,456 --> 01:35:44,961
不到那时候 我们谁也不知道答案
None of us ever know the answer to that question until the moment arises.

966
01:35:45,379 --> 01:35:47,464
你的意见呢 舍尔斯？
What's your opinion, Shears?

967
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:49,675
嗯 他是加拿大人
Well, he's Canadian.

968
01:35:49,883 --> 01:35:53,929
正好吻合我们这个多国组合行动
That fits with the international composition of this outfit.

969
01:35:54,431 --> 01:35:56,766
如果他想去 他可以替我去！
If he wants to go, he can take my place!

970
01:35:57,559 --> 01:36:01,062
嗯 如果大家都同意乔伊斯去 那就让他们参加吧
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce, he's yours.

971
01:36:01,772 --> 01:36:04,817
我们对那个村庄进行了空中侦察
I had an air reconnaissance report on the village.

972
01:36:05,067 --> 01:36:08,028
你们可以在晚上空降到那里
There's enough clearing to make your jump at dusk.

973
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:11,490
- 你经过跳伞训练吗？ - 没有 长官
- You've had parachute training? - No, sir.

974
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,411
该死！ 这个可麻烦了
Blast! This is awkward.

975
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:16,872
从来没遇到过这样的事情！
Silly, it never occurred to me!

976
01:36:17,414 --> 01:36:18,498
也许 我可以不…
Well, maybe...

977
01:36:18,748 --> 01:36:21,668
我们可以给他安排一些训练
He's right. Arrange some practice jumps for him.

978
01:36:21,919 --> 01:36:23,796
我现在就去安排
I'll go check right away.

979
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:27,091
- 好的 查普曼 你也可以走了 - 是的 长官
- All right, Chapman, you can run along. - Yes, sir.

980
01:36:29,427 --> 01:36:31,721
嗯 是不是很简单？
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

981
01:36:31,972 --> 01:36:33,348
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

982
01:36:33,599 --> 01:36:36,268
你不知道你是多么的重要
You don't realize what a plum you are.

983
01:36:36,518 --> 01:36:40,022
你熟悉那地区 你和那村庄里的人结交朋友
Your knowledge of the area, making friends in that village.

984
01:36:40,231 --> 01:36:44,402
就好像整个逃跑 都是我们计划好的
It's almost as if your whole escape had been planned with us in mind.

985
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:51,701
这里有些东西 你可能会感兴趣 新的" L"药片
By the way, here's something that'll interest you. The new " L" pill.

986
01:36:52,745 --> 01:36:56,290
- " L"药片？ - 致命毒药 迅速 无痛
- L pill? - L for lethal. Instant, painless.

987
01:36:56,498 --> 01:36:59,835
比老的型号要好很多 当然是为了被俘时使用
Much better than the old ones. For capture, of course.

988
01:37:00,045 --> 01:37:02,589
你是想告诉我不要被活捉
You're telling me not to be taken alive.

989
01:37:02,839 --> 01:37:04,633
算我没说
I wouldn't recommend it.

990
01:37:05,133 --> 01:37:09,346
如果你们谁受伤了 其他人会把他扔在身后的
If any of you get hurt or wounded the others will have to leave him behind.

991
01:37:09,597 --> 01:37:11,933
在这次行动中 炸毁目标是第一要务
The objective comes first in our work.

992
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,188
你想听我对这小组的真实评价吗？ 在他们面前我没有说
You want my honest evaluation? I didn't want to say in front of them.

993
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:19,233
我明白 请讲
I understand, go ahead.

994
01:37:20,692 --> 01:37:23,946
嗯 查普曼很好 在他血管里流的是冰水
Well, Chapman will be fine. Ice water in his veins.

995
01:37:24,196 --> 01:37:26,949
乔伊斯 吗… 他会好的
Joyce is.... He'll be okay.

996
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:29,869
- 华登 我觉得不行 - 为什么？
- It's Warden I don't get. - Oh? Why not?

997
01:37:30,078 --> 01:37:31,829
他只是个剑桥老师
Cambridge don and all of that.

998
01:37:32,038 --> 01:37:35,625
他就像个玩鞭炮的孩子…
It's one thing to play with explosives like a kid with firecrackers...

999
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:38,212
他经验很丰富的
He's not without experience, you know.

1000
01:37:39,088 --> 01:37:43,050
当新加坡陷落的时候 他在后面炸掉了几座大桥
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind to blow up a couple of bridges.

1001
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,553
还在小日本抓住他之前 安装了好几个装置
Many other installations before the Japs caught him.

1002
01:37:46,805 --> 01:37:50,308
- 真精彩 他… - 长官 有些麻烦
- Fascinating story. He... - Sir, it's most annoying.

1003
01:37:50,558 --> 01:37:55,146
从时间上考虑 他们认为练习跳伞意义不大
In view of time, they don't think practice jumps would be worth it.

1004
01:37:55,398 --> 01:37:59,318
如果你跳一次 只有50%机会受伤
If you make one jump there's only a 50?0 chance of injury.

1005
01:37:59,568 --> 01:38:03,155
跳两次 80% 3次 他肯定要受伤
Two jumps, 80?0. Three jumps, you're bound to get your packet.

1006
01:38:03,406 --> 01:38:07,326
大家的一致的结论是 最好的办法就是让舍尔斯…
The consensus is, the most sensible thing for Shears to do...

1007
01:38:07,536 --> 01:38:10,539
不要训练 直接去跳下去
...is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best.

1008
01:38:10,789 --> 01:38:12,833
带不带降落伞？
With or without parachute?

1009
01:38:17,922 --> 01:38:20,133
噢 很好！
Oh, very good!

1010
01:38:23,721 --> 01:38:25,347
带不带降落伞！
With or without!

1011
01:39:22,535 --> 01:39:23,578
他挂在树上！
He's in the trees!

1012
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,249
Yai 说我们不能从你的那条路去桂河
Yai says we can't reach the Kwai your way.

1013
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:09,670
有太多的日军岗哨 我们要迂回到北方穿越原始森林
There are too many Japanese patrols. We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

1014
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,173
- 那么谁带路？ - Yai
- Then who's going to lead? - Yai.

1015
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,968
他恨日本人 他们抓走了这里所有的男人
He hates the Japanese. They took all his men.

1016
01:40:15,219 --> 01:40:17,972
我们必须用妇女来帮我们搬东西
Which means we shall have to use women bearers.

1017
01:40:18,222 --> 01:40:20,391
- 妇女！ - 她们能胜任的
- Women bearers! - They're capable.

1018
01:40:32,195 --> 01:40:35,282
他说在这里过夜很危险
He says it's dangerous to spend the night here.

1019
01:40:35,533 --> 01:40:39,704
3里外有个日军岗哨 所以我们要在森林里睡觉了
There's an enemy post three miles away so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

1020
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:44,667
- 查普曼怎么办？ - Yai会把他和伞埋起来
- What about Chapman? - Yai will bury him and his chute.

1021
01:40:44,918 --> 01:40:46,545
有什么问题吗？
Is there something wrong?

1022
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:52,426
我正在想你会说他们的语言 而我不会
I was just thinking. You speak Yai's language. I don't.

1023
01:40:52,676 --> 01:40:56,680
他要带路走我从未走过的路
He's going to lead you to the river by a route I never took.

1024
01:40:56,931 --> 01:41:00,560
那么还要我来干什么呢？
Will someone tell me why I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1025
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:05,106
我知道你的感受 但事情总有万一 对不对？
I know how you feel, but there's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1026
01:41:05,691 --> 01:41:07,401
和查普曼讲万一吧
Tell that to Chapman.

1027
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:09,278
我们开始行动吧！
Let's get cracking!

1028
01:44:13,231 --> 01:44:14,900
你很可爱
You're lovely.

1029
01:44:17,444 --> 01:44:18,695
可  爱
Lovely.

1030
01:44:18,945 --> 01:44:21,156
工作愉快！
Be happy in your work!

1031
01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:22,617
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1032
01:44:50,022 --> 01:44:51,398
蚂蝗
Leeches.

1033
01:44:51,982 --> 01:44:53,484
蚂蝗
Leeches.

1034
01:45:08,793 --> 01:45:12,880
她让你别动她会把你背上的蚂蝗弄下来
She's telling you to hold still. She'll take the leeches off your back.

1035
01:45:13,256 --> 01:45:15,591
象你这样的女孩怎么能在这种地方呢？
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?

1036
01:45:15,843 --> 01:45:18,345
我会教你说暹罗语
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1037
01:45:18,595 --> 01:45:22,099
不 太多的交谈会坏事
No, that would spoil it. Too much talk always spoils it.

1038
01:45:22,307 --> 01:45:23,767
那玩意儿怎么了？
What's wrong with that thing?

1039
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:27,688
信号太弱了
It's taken an awful beating. I can't get a strong signal.

1040
01:45:27,939 --> 01:45:33,069
因为这里又湿又霉！ 雨林里所有的一切都是这样
I'll tell you. It's wet, mildewed! Like everything else in this jungle.

1041
01:45:33,486 --> 01:45:35,196
你最好把它扔掉！
You might as well dump it!

1042
01:45:40,286 --> 01:45:42,496
这里是东京电台 广播结束
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1043
01:45:42,705 --> 01:45:47,209
提醒您不要紧张…
This is your friendliest enemy reminding you to take it easy...

1044
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:50,005
…不要盲动
...and never volunteer for anything.

1045
01:46:03,186 --> 01:46:05,230
如果我们还呆在这里 我们就出不去了
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.

1046
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:07,733
- 就快译好了 长官 - 快读！
- I've got it all decoded, sir. - Read it!

1047
01:46:07,983 --> 01:46:11,820
是 长官 "1 原来说的大桥已经不再建了
Yes, sir. "One, original bridge works reported abandoned.

1048
01:46:12,029 --> 01:46:14,656
在原址下游的地方 在建新的大桥
New construction downstream from first site.

1049
01:46:14,907 --> 01:46:18,995
2 敌人想在通车典礼上从曼谷到仰光
Two, enemy intends to open railway with passage of special train...

1050
01:46:19,203 --> 01:46:22,165
开出一列专列…满载军队和重要人物
...Bangkok for Rangoon with troops and V.I.P.

1051
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:25,044
估计在13号上午到达目的地
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 1 3th.

1052
01:46:25,252 --> 01:46:28,422
3 同时要炸掉专列
Three, synchronize demolition with passage of train.

1053
01:46:28,672 --> 01:46:31,800
4 好好干 玩的开心" 就是这些
Four, good hunting. Have fun." That's all.

1054
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:33,845
一列火车和一座大桥！
A train and a bridge!

1055
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:36,306
我们能及时赶到那里吗 长官？
Can we get there in time, sir?

1056
01:46:36,514 --> 01:46:38,975
Yai说我们还有2- 3天的路程
Yai says we're two to three days away.

1057
01:46:39,225 --> 01:46:43,313
如果我们快走的话 我们会在12号日落前赶到那里
If we set a faster pace, we could make it before sundown on the 1 2th.

1058
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,483
搭上一列火车 很值
It's worth it for the train.

1059
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:49,028
好 我们要尽一切办法 好好干 玩的开心
Oh, by all means. Good hunting. Good show.

1060
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,238
玩的开心 干得很好
Jolly good fun. Jolly good.

1061
01:46:52,366 --> 01:46:55,827
如果你没有修好收音机 我们就不会知道还有一列火车
If you hadn't fixed the radio, we wouldn't know about the train.

1062
01:46:56,078 --> 01:46:58,830
总有万一 对不对？
There's always the unexpected, isn't there?

1063
01:47:23,983 --> 01:47:26,486
- 半品脱 长官 - 奎宁
- Half a pint, sir. - Quinine.

1064
01:47:28,197 --> 01:47:30,866
嗯 我们回头再弄
Well, we'll complete this later.

1065
01:47:31,742 --> 01:47:35,246
- 柯林普顿 我们遇到一个问题 - 是吗 长官？
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis. - Yes, sir?

1066
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:40,292
我与里夫 和休斯谈过 我们不可能及时建好大桥
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes. We can't finish the bridge on time.

1067
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:42,129
我们人力不够
We haven't the manpower.

1068
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:45,674
我已经请指挥官参加劳动 但是还不够
I've asked the officers to help, but that won't do it.

1069
01:47:45,924 --> 01:47:47,509
指挥官也在干活？
The officers are working?

1070
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,514
我解释了情况 他们志愿参加 但是人还不够
I explained the situation and they volunteered, but it's not enough.

1071
01:47:51,764 --> 01:47:53,516
为什么不向 Saito要求一些人？
Why not ask Saito for some men?

1072
01:47:53,766 --> 01:47:56,769
这是我们的任务 要用我们自己最大的资源
This is ours. We'll make the most of our resources.

1073
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,898
这就是我为什么来和你谈 我要病人名单
That's why I came to talk to you. The sick list.

1074
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:03,944
这里都是病人
There's not a man in this hospital who doesn't belong there.

1075
01:48:04,194 --> 01:48:08,866
我并不是责备你 但总有一些人要装病
It's no reflection on you, but there are always a few malingerers.

1076
01:48:09,117 --> 01:48:11,536
保持警惕 这就是我要说的
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.

1077
01:48:11,786 --> 01:48:13,621
过来 我们来看看
Come along, let's see.

1078
01:48:15,082 --> 01:48:16,959
别动 别动
Don't move, don't move.

1079
01:48:20,754 --> 01:48:22,381
Haskins什么病？
What's wrong with Haskins?

1080
01:48:22,631 --> 01:48:26,260
阿米巴痢疾和发烧 104度
Amoebic dysentery and black water fever. Temperature of 1 04.

1081
01:48:26,511 --> 01:48:28,013
好的 我知道了
Right. I see.

1082
01:48:31,099 --> 01:48:32,309
这个人呢？
And this man?

1083
01:48:32,559 --> 01:48:36,479
腿部溃疡 如果我昨天多切一点的话 就可以保住这条腿
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save it if I do more cutting tonight.

1084
01:48:36,731 --> 01:48:38,691
要把他派去劳动吗？
Want to send him out to work?

1085
01:48:38,941 --> 01:48:40,735
不许胡说八道 柯林普顿
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1086
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:46,283
那个人呢？
That man there?

1087
01:48:46,533 --> 01:48:47,743
胳膊感染
His arm's infected.

1088
01:48:47,993 --> 01:48:50,329
这些人的伤大多数都不会彻底痊愈
Most of their wounds won't heal properly.

1089
01:48:50,537 --> 01:48:55,459
我在想 新鲜空气和轻微的劳动 会比关在这笼子里好些
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.

1090
01:48:55,710 --> 01:48:58,713
- 轻微的劳动？ - 因为擦伤胳膊就把他放在这里…
- Light duties? - It's not our policy to keep a man...

1091
01:48:58,963 --> 01:49:02,759
- 不符合我们的原则 - 不符合我们的原则？
- ...just because he scratched his arm. - Not our policy?

1092
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:07,014
即使状态不佳 但是还是可以利用的
A man may not be on top of his form, but he can still be useful.

1093
01:49:07,264 --> 01:49:10,893
比如清理焊缝啦 收拾现场啦 稍息 贝克
Trimmings and finishing jobs. Stand easy, Baker.

1094
01:49:11,144 --> 01:49:14,731
你想去桥上做些轻微的工作吗？
Do you feel up to doing a little light work on the bridge?

1095
01:49:16,358 --> 01:49:18,902
- 随您吩咐 长官 - 很好
- Anything you say, sir. - Good show.

1096
01:49:20,196 --> 01:49:21,656
你呢？ 有困难吗
You? Nothing difficult.

1097
01:49:21,906 --> 01:49:24,325
- 我会尽力 长官 - 好样的
- I'll try, sir. - Good man.

1098
01:49:26,077 --> 01:49:30,831
同志们 不言而喻 我以你们为荣
Look here, men. It goes without saying that I'm proud of all of you.

1099
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:35,629
但是我们现在遇到困难 如果你们觉得自己能行的话
But we're facing a crisis. For those of you who feel up to it...

1100
01:49:35,879 --> 01:49:39,966
能援助我们一下吗？ 做一些力所能及的事情 搬搬弄弄 涂涂抹抹？
...how about lending us a hand? Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1101
01:49:40,218 --> 01:49:41,636
怎么样？
What do you say?

1102
01:49:41,844 --> 01:49:45,473
- 是的 长官 - 好样的 跟我来吧
- Yes, sir. - Good show. Come on, follow me.

1103
01:51:28,045 --> 01:51:29,087
10分钟
Ten minutes.

1104
01:53:27,135 --> 01:53:29,012
要确认他们全都死了
Make sure they're all dead.

1105
01:53:32,474 --> 01:53:33,850
跟我来 乔伊斯
Come on, Joyce.

1106
01:53:36,061 --> 01:53:38,689
用匕首 否则我们会打到自己人
Use your knife or we'll be shooting each other.

1107
01:53:50,994 --> 01:53:52,662
走那边 乔伊斯
Go that way, Joyce.

1108
01:56:01,096 --> 01:56:03,932
我可以干掉他的 我已经准备好了
I could have done it. I was ready.

1109
01:56:08,438 --> 01:56:09,814
你受伤了 长官？
Are you hit, sir?

1110
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:11,483
走
Let's go.

1111
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,552
只是表面伤 不会有骨折
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone, but nothing broken.

1112
01:56:36,803 --> 01:56:38,930
- 是我的错 长官 - 噢 住嘴
- It's my fault, sir. - Oh, shut up.

1113
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,682
我可以走的不很严重
I can walk on it. That's all that counts.

1114
01:56:41,892 --> 01:56:43,644
是啊 但是还有多远 我们能走多快呢？
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1115
01:56:43,852 --> 01:56:46,522
不试不知道 对不对？
We won't know that till I've tried it, will we?

1116
01:59:59,026 --> 02:00:00,695
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1117
02:00:01,153 --> 02:00:03,239
我没有命令停止
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1118
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:04,907
我们都需要休息一下
We all need it.

1119
02:00:08,996 --> 02:00:12,541
我们还要5小时急行军才能到达目标
We're still five hours' fast march from the objective.

1120
02:00:12,749 --> 02:00:14,084
也许要6小时
Maybe six.

1121
02:00:15,127 --> 02:00:16,295
快
Come on.

1122
02:00:16,503 --> 02:00:19,047
如果你一直走的话 你会流血不止而死的
If you keep walking, you'll bleed to death.

1123
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,684
- 你们必须把我留在这里 - 你停下来 我们就停下来
- You're going to leave me here. - If you stop, we stop.

1124
02:00:30,603 --> 02:00:33,230
你不可能在夜里研究大桥的结构
You can't study the layout of the bridge after dark.

1125
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:35,566
你们必须在日落前赶到那里
You've got to get there before sundown.

1126
02:00:35,774 --> 02:00:40,446
但是 长官 任务结束后 我们不能保证顺这条路返回…
But, sir, when the job's done, who knows if we can return by this route...

1127
02:00:40,697 --> 02:00:42,824
即使我们走这条路 也不能保证找到你
...or whether we could find you if we did?

1128
02:00:43,074 --> 02:00:46,620
如果我是你的话 你知道的 我就一点也不犹豫就会离开你
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate to leave you and you know that.

1129
02:00:47,038 --> 02:00:48,289
他不知道 但是我知道
He doesn't know, but I do.

1130
02:00:48,539 --> 02:00:52,001
你会把你妈妈抛弃在这里的 如果规则要求这样的话
You'd leave your own mother here if the rules called for it.

1131
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:56,172
你们必须继续前进这是命令
You'll go on without me. That's an order.

1132
02:00:56,381 --> 02:00:58,675
舍尔斯 现在由你来指挥
You're in command now, Shears.

1133
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:03,263
我不遵守这条命令
I won't obey that order.

1134
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:05,390
你的英雄主义让我恶心
Your heroics make me sick.

1135
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:08,394
你们都带着死亡的臭气
You carry the stench of death like the plague.

1136
02:01:08,645 --> 02:01:10,855
爆炸 L药片
Explosives and L- pills go well together.

1137
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:14,692
不是这个就是那个 要么毁掉大桥 要么毁掉自己
It's one thing or the other. Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1138
02:01:15,027 --> 02:01:16,737
这场战争只是个游戏
This is just a game, this war.

1139
02:01:16,987 --> 02:01:20,908
你和那个尼科尔森上校都有疯狂的勇气 为了什么？
You and that Colonel Nicholson. You're crazy with courage. For what?

1140
02:01:21,158 --> 02:01:24,119
怎样才能死的象个绅士 怎样死才符合规矩…
How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules...

1141
02:01:24,329 --> 02:01:28,083
而问题是要怎样才能象个人那样活着！
...when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!

1142
02:01:32,087 --> 02:01:34,964
我不会让你死在这里的 华登…
I'm not gonna leave you here to die, Warden...

1143
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,179
因为我才不管你那个什么大桥或者你的什么规则
...because I don't care about your bridge or about your rules.

1144
02:01:40,638 --> 02:01:43,307
如果我们继续前进 我们就一块走
If we go on, we go on together.

1145
02:01:46,228 --> 02:01:47,896
老Yai 干得好
Good old Yai.

1146
02:01:59,867 --> 02:02:01,035
好的
All right.

1147
02:02:11,714 --> 02:02:13,007
快过来
Come on.

1148
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:03,980
我们走近些
Let's get closer.

1149
02:03:23,501 --> 02:03:25,712
还在耿耿于怀我们带你一起来吗？
Still sorry we brought you along?

1150
02:03:27,381 --> 02:03:29,300
- 感觉好点了吗？ - 是的
- Feeling better? - Yeah.

1151
02:03:29,508 --> 02:03:31,761
现在还由你指挥
You're in command again, you know.

1152
02:03:31,969 --> 02:03:33,638
谢谢 上校
Thank you, major.

1153
02:03:34,513 --> 02:03:39,518
真奇怪这是一座坚固的 设计得很好的大桥
I can't understand it. It's such a solid, well- designed job.

1154
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:45,108
并不象敌人一贯拼凑的的那种东西
Not like the bridges the enemy usually throws together.

1155
02:03:45,443 --> 02:03:46,694
看
Look.

1156
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:50,573
下面那些可怜的小鬼子
Those poor devils down there.

1157
02:03:50,823 --> 02:03:54,661
可以想象他们被逼着在这样的条件下建桥的情景
Imagine being forced to build that in the condition they must be in.

1158
02:03:55,788 --> 02:03:58,791
还有英国军官在地上工作
They've got a British officer working on his knees.

1159
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:01,126
小日本好像很高兴
The Japanese seem to be enjoying it too.

1160
02:04:02,294 --> 02:04:05,130
如果他知道我们在这里 肯定可以鼓舞他的士气
If he knew we were here, it might boost his morale.

1161
02:04:24,611 --> 02:04:27,781
如果不是也要炸那火车 我们就可以设置个定时炸弹 然后跑到几里之外
If not for the train, we could set a time fuse and be miles away.

1162
02:04:28,198 --> 02:04:31,034
我们不知道火车明天是什么时间通过这里…
Since we don't know what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1163
02:04:31,284 --> 02:04:33,286
我们不得不手动引爆炸药
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1164
02:04:33,287 --> 02:04:33,538
我们不得不手动引爆炸药
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1165
02:04:34,163 --> 02:04:36,916
我们可以把炸药填在桥墩3尺水面下
We'll set the charges against the piles...

1166
02:04:37,166 --> 02:04:40,670
我想…
...about three feet underwater, I should think...

1167
02:04:40,921 --> 02:04:44,258
把主线缆布到下游引爆者那里
...and run the main wire downstream to the plunger.

1168
02:04:45,509 --> 02:04:48,345
问题是引爆者应该藏在哪里？
The problem is where to hide it.

1169
02:04:53,518 --> 02:04:56,563
我们这一边河流很显然被日军占用
Our side of the river is obviously used by the Japanese.

1170
02:04:56,896 --> 02:04:58,773
他们一眼就能发现
They'd spot it at once.

1171
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:05,781
看 你们看到那些树段和它们下面的岩石了吗？
Look. Do you see those fallen tree trunks?

1172
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:09,326
在那边的小沙滩上？
And the grey rock just below them on that little beach?

1173
02:05:09,911 --> 02:05:13,415
- 是的 长官 我看到他们了 - 那里就是我们的引爆位置
- Yes, sir, I see them. - That's our key position.

1174
02:05:14,458 --> 02:05:16,042
虽然在河的那边…
The wrong side of the river...

1175
02:05:16,293 --> 02:05:19,880
…但是是在有效距离内的唯一藏身之处
...but it's the only hiding place within feasible distance.

1176
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,426
当桥被引爆之后…
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1177
02:05:23,885 --> 02:05:26,762
…那个人必须游回来
...whoever's there will have to swim back.

1178
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:28,973
这样游泳可不好受
It won't be a pleasant swim.

1179
02:05:29,224 --> 02:05:31,768
长官 我的游泳技术是最好的
Sir, I was the best swimmer in my course.

1180
02:05:34,646 --> 02:05:37,024
看来只能是你了
It looks like your line of country, then.

1181
02:05:37,233 --> 02:05:38,067
谢谢
Thank you.

1182
02:05:38,276 --> 02:05:42,113
舍尔斯 在这个岸边找个地方掩护乔伊斯
Shears, pick a spot on our side of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1183
02:05:42,363 --> 02:05:45,283
Yai会和你一起 当小日本发现乔伊斯时
Yai will be with you so you can occupy the Nips...

1184
02:05:45,491 --> 02:05:47,660
你们可以帮助他
...if they make trouble for Joyce.

1185
02:05:47,912 --> 02:05:50,372
理论上总有万一…
On the theory that there's always one more thing...

1186
02:05:50,623 --> 02:05:55,044
我也会在这边用迫击炮牵制他们的
...l'll set up the mortar here to create an additional diversion.

1187
02:05:55,294 --> 02:05:58,672
甚至我还可以对火车来几下
Perhaps I might even take a few potshots at the train.

1188
02:05:58,924 --> 02:06:00,175
都明白了吗？
All clear?

1189
02:06:00,425 --> 02:06:03,720
还有问题吗？ 好的 你天一黑就行动
Any questions? Right, you'll start as soon as it's dark.

1190
02:06:03,929 --> 02:06:06,765
他们肯定在桥上有岗哨…
They're sure to have sentries on the bridge...

1191
02:06:06,974 --> 02:06:10,811
所以你必须从上游把炸药送过去
...so you'll have to float the stuff down from upriver...

1192
02:06:11,062 --> 02:06:12,897
也就是说要扎一个筏子
...which means building a raft.

1193
02:06:13,105 --> 02:06:14,148
Yai.

1194
02:06:19,154 --> 02:06:21,615
Yai会带3个妇女帮助你
Yai will take three women to help you.

1195
02:06:21,865 --> 02:06:24,952
还有一个要和我呆在一起 好 开始行动！
One will stay here with me. All right, get cracking!

1196
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:34,545
你知道 如果不是脚踝受伤 乔伊斯的任务就是我的了
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle, I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1197
02:06:35,172 --> 02:06:37,049
你认为他行吗？
You think he'll be all right?

1198
02:06:37,341 --> 02:06:39,760
我觉得可以 要我来处理吗？
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1199
02:06:40,344 --> 02:06:43,305
如果可以的话 我会让你和迫击炮呆在一起
I'd let you stay up here with the mortar if I could.

1200
02:06:43,932 --> 02:06:45,183
对不起
I'm sorry.

1201
02:06:45,892 --> 02:06:48,436
结束之后 我希望你能得到病休…
When it's over, I hope you get that medical discharge...

1202
02:06:48,645 --> 02:06:50,605
而且是毫不困难地得到
...and not the hard way.

1203
02:06:50,814 --> 02:06:52,065
谢谢
Thanks.

1204
02:07:30,233 --> 02:07:31,276
装弹
Load.

1205
02:08:37,098 --> 02:08:38,391
真漂亮
Beautiful.

1206
02:08:39,142 --> 02:08:40,810
是的 很漂亮
Yes, beautiful.

1207
02:08:41,102 --> 02:08:42,896
一流的工程
A first- rate job.

1208
02:08:43,355 --> 02:08:45,815
我从未想到会做得这么好
I had no idea it would turn out so well.

1209
02:08:51,197 --> 02:08:53,532
是啊 干得很漂亮
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1210
02:08:54,743 --> 02:08:56,245
我一直在想…
I've been thinking....

1211
02:08:57,246 --> 02:09:01,875
明天就是我服役28年
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day that I've been in the service.

1212
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:04,795
28年的和平与战争
Twenty- eight years in peace and war.

1213
02:09:06,089 --> 02:09:09,801
我呆在家里的时间不超过10个月
I haven't been at home more than ten months in all that time.

1214
02:09:10,385 --> 02:09:12,720
当然 这仍然是完美的人生
Still, it's been a good life.

1215
02:09:14,056 --> 02:09:16,183
我热爱印度
I love lndia.

1216
02:09:17,768 --> 02:09:20,020
我不可能从头再来
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1217
02:09:21,689 --> 02:09:23,399
但是 有时候…
But there are times....

1218
02:09:25,068 --> 02:09:29,406
突然你会意识到你又回到了起点
Suddenly you realize you are nearer the end than the beginning.

1219
02:09:30,407 --> 02:09:31,950
而你感到彷徨…
And you wonder....

1220
02:09:33,619 --> 02:09:35,663
你问自己…
You ask yourself...

1221
02:09:36,998 --> 02:09:40,251
…人生的意义是什么…
...what the sum total of your life represents...

1222
02:09:41,043 --> 02:09:44,630
…这样和那样又有什么差别…
...what difference your being there at any time made to anything...

1223
02:09:45,132 --> 02:09:47,759
…这样和那样又有什么差别…
...or if it made any difference at all, really.

1224
02:09:49,386 --> 02:09:52,764
与其他的职业比起来
Particularly in comparison with other men's careers.

1225
02:09:53,433 --> 02:09:55,935
我不知道这样想是否正确的…
I don't know if that kind of thinking's healthy...

1226
02:09:56,519 --> 02:10:00,314
但是我必须承认 我一直在思考这些问题
...but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines...

1227
02:10:00,566 --> 02:10:02,568
但是我必须承认 我一直在思考这些问题
...from time to time.

1228
02:10:05,654 --> 02:10:07,364
但 今晚…
But tonight....

1229
02:10:08,824 --> 02:10:09,867
今晚…
Tonight....

1230
02:10:13,621 --> 02:10:15,081
糟糕
Blast.

1231
02:10:22,006 --> 02:10:23,466
我得走了
I must be off.

1232
02:10:26,302 --> 02:10:29,680
他们在准备一些娱乐活动
The men are preparing some sort of entertainment.

1233
02:11:16,566 --> 02:11:17,859
真可爱
Lovely.

1234
02:13:26,793 --> 02:13:30,088
如果你是
If you were the only

1235
02:13:30,297 --> 02:13:33,050
世上唯一的女孩
Girl in the world

1236
02:13:33,258 --> 02:13:38,388
你是世上唯一男孩
And you were the only boy

1237
02:13:38,807 --> 02:13:41,184
其他的一切都不重要
Nothing else would matter

1238
02:13:41,392 --> 02:13:44,479
在今天
In the world today

1239
02:13:44,979 --> 02:13:47,023
我们要相爱
We could go on loving

1240
02:13:47,233 --> 02:13:50,444
用古老的方式
In the same old way

1241
02:13:51,028 --> 02:13:56,158
伊甸园只是为两个人而建
A Garden of Eden just made for two

1242
02:18:30,087 --> 02:18:31,922
我代表大家说几句…
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1243
02:18:32,130 --> 02:18:35,217
这是一个愉快的夜晚
...when I say this has been a most enjoyable evening.

1244
02:18:36,969 --> 02:18:42,100
明天你们大多数都要转移到一个新的战俘营 开始新的工作
Most of you move on tomorrow to a new camp and new construction.

1245
02:18:42,558 --> 02:18:46,896
很遗憾你们看不到大桥的首次使用
It's a pity you won't see the first practical use of this bridge.

1246
02:18:47,147 --> 02:18:49,817
你们会很高兴的知道这座大桥
You'll be glad to know that the completion...

1247
02:18:50,067 --> 02:18:52,277
所连接的铁路
...of this link in the railway...

1248
02:18:52,486 --> 02:18:55,864
可以让我们用火车来
...will enable us to transport the sick and disabled...

1249
02:18:56,116 --> 02:18:59,202
把伤病员运输到新的营地
...to the new camp by train.

1250
02:19:00,829 --> 02:19:03,790
Saito上校善意的允许
Colonel Saito has kindly permitted me to stay behind...

1251
02:19:03,998 --> 02:19:06,334
我和柯林普顿上校留在最后
...with Major Clipton and the sick men...

1252
02:19:06,585 --> 02:19:10,089
几天后我们就会会合
...and we'll rejoin you in a few days' time.

1253
02:19:12,133 --> 02:19:15,261
现在你们这里的工作已经结束了
Now that your work here is finished...

1254
02:19:15,512 --> 02:19:19,558
我想你们有很多人会松弛下来
...l suppose many of you feel somewhat let down.

1255
02:19:20,350 --> 02:19:22,352
这完全可以理解
That's quite understandable.

1256
02:19:22,644 --> 02:19:25,272
这是很自然的反应
It's a very natural reaction.

1257
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:30,903
但是某年某月某周某天
But one day, in a week, a month, a year...

1258
02:19:31,112 --> 02:19:34,949
在那一天 上帝保佑 我们全部回到自己的家乡
...on that day when, God willing, we all return to our homes again...

1259
02:19:35,659 --> 02:19:40,789
你会对自己在这里的工作感到自豪
...you're going to feel very proud of what you've achieved here...

1260
02:19:41,123 --> 02:19:43,834
你会对自己在这里的工作感到自豪
...in the face of great adversity.

1261
02:19:45,044 --> 02:19:47,172
你们所做的
What you have done should be...

1262
02:19:48,047 --> 02:19:49,883
我想会是
...and I think will be...

1263
02:19:50,258 --> 02:19:54,888
我们国民 战士和市民的榜样
...an example to all our countrymen, soldier and civilian alike.

1264
02:19:56,098 --> 02:19:58,642
你们光荣地生存下来
You have survived with honour.

1265
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,353
另外
That, and more.

1266
02:20:02,981 --> 02:20:05,108
在这个蛮荒之地
Here in the wilderness...

1267
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:08,862
你们转败为胜
...you have turned defeat into victory.

1268
02:20:11,616 --> 02:20:13,659
我祝贺你们
I congratulate you.

1269
02:20:14,202 --> 02:20:15,244
干得不错
Well done.

1270
02:20:20,626 --> 02:20:21,919
为了国王
To the king.

1271
02:23:04,306 --> 02:23:05,766
你现在就位了
You're in business.

1272
02:23:05,974 --> 02:23:10,103
还差什么吗？ 树干 弹药 背包 水壶 匕首
Now, you got everything? Stem, ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1273
02:23:11,773 --> 02:23:14,067
我会直接穿过河流
I'll be directly across the river.

1274
02:23:15,526 --> 02:23:18,446
教授说总要以防万一
The professor says there's always one more thing to do.

1275
02:23:19,156 --> 02:23:21,367
但我想不起来要防什么
I can't think of what it could be.

1276
02:23:22,785 --> 02:23:25,329
除了祝你你长命百岁
Except to wish you a long and happy life.

1277
02:23:25,746 --> 02:23:26,830
谢谢
Thank you.

1278
02:25:42,564 --> 02:25:44,024
发生了什么事情？
What's happened?

1279
02:25:49,197 --> 02:25:50,949
水位降低了
The river's gone down.

1280
02:26:13,181 --> 02:26:15,100
可以看到电线了
You can see the wire.

1281
02:26:15,934 --> 02:26:17,227
炸药包！
The charges!

1282
02:28:25,536 --> 02:28:27,955
别等火车了
Don't wait for the train.

1283
02:28:28,247 --> 02:28:29,331
现在引爆！
Do it now!

1284
02:28:56,903 --> 02:29:00,740
如果Saito是对的 火车在5到10分钟后就会过来
If Saito is correct, the train will arrive in 5 or 1 0 minutes.

1285
02:29:00,992 --> 02:29:03,744
如果你不介意 我想从山顶上看
If you don't mind, I'll watch from up on the hill.

1286
02:29:03,995 --> 02:29:05,913
为什么？ 从桥上最好
Why? It's better from the bridge.

1287
02:29:06,163 --> 02:29:09,667
很难解释 先生 我不想成为这典礼的一部分
It's hard to explain, sir. I'd rather not be a part of it.

1288
02:29:09,918 --> 02:29:14,256
随你 说真的 有时我真不了解你
As you please. Honestly, sometimes I don't understand you at all.

1289
02:29:14,506 --> 02:29:18,844
如你所说 长官 我还要好好学习战争
As you once said, sir, I've got a lot to learn about the army.

1290
02:29:25,811 --> 02:29:27,187
早上好
Good morning.

1291
02:29:27,438 --> 02:29:29,690
夜里水位降低了
River's gone down in the night.

1292
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:15,598
他在干什么？
What's he doing?

1293
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:05,528
上校 有古怪
Colonel, there's something rather odd going on.

1294
02:32:05,779 --> 02:32:09,450
我认为在火车到来之前 我们应该检查一下
I think we better have a look around before that train comes across.

1295
02:33:08,306 --> 02:33:09,724
他简直疯了
He's gone mad.

1296
02:33:09,933 --> 02:33:12,018
他把他带到那里去了！
He's leading him right to it!

1297
02:33:12,269 --> 02:33:13,688
可是我们自己人！
Our own man!

1298
02:33:57,903 --> 02:34:00,823
我是对的 有古怪
I was right. There is something going on.

1299
02:34:55,967 --> 02:34:59,304
干掉他 孩子！
You've got to do it, boy! You've got to do it now!

1300
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:06,102
你有刀子吗？ 我认为大桥被下了炸药了！
Have you a knife? I just realized the bridge has been mined!

1301
02:35:06,312 --> 02:35:07,313
炸药！
Mined!

1302
02:35:07,313 --> 02:35:07,772
炸药！
Mined!

1303
02:35:14,655 --> 02:35:15,739
好小子！
Good boy!

1304
02:35:20,702 --> 02:35:23,455
英军指挥官！ 我来炸掉大桥
British officer! Here to blow up the bridge.

1305
02:35:23,706 --> 02:35:27,835
- 炸掉大桥！ - 对 长官 英军指挥部的命令
- Blow up the bridge! - Yes, sir. British commando orders.

1306
02:35:28,086 --> 02:35:30,713
- 炸掉大桥？！ - 是的 没有时间了！
- Blow up the bridge?! - Yes. There's no time!

1307
02:35:30,922 --> 02:35:33,383
不 不行！ 救命！
No, no! Help!

1308
02:35:40,641 --> 02:35:42,935
杀掉他！ 杀掉他！
Kill him! Kill him!

1309
02:35:43,311 --> 02:35:45,772
让我走 长官！ 你不明白！
Let me go, sir! You don't understand!

1310
02:35:46,815 --> 02:35:49,693
杀掉他！ 杀掉他！
Kill him! Kill him!

1311
02:35:59,996 --> 02:36:01,790
杀掉他 乔伊斯！
Kill him, Joyce!

1312
02:36:55,265 --> 02:36:56,308
你！
