2
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,084
Finish work!

3
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,482
Go to hut.

4
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,161
Yeah, that figures.

5
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:23,997
If the new prisoners see us
digging graves, they may run.

6
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:27,160
No time for jokes. Finish work!

7
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,282
Dig, dig.

8
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:31,957
How about putting us
on sick list?

9
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,162
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.

10
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:38,565
You no sick. You never sick.

11
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:41,157
Why you always play sick, Shears?

12
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,166
Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.

13
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,602
Captain Kanematsu...

14
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,402
...how about a butt?

15
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,208
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

16
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:55,520
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.

17
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,401
When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart...

18
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:02,357
...like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.

19
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:05,366
That's why...

20
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,358
...I want you to keep this lighter.

21
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,966
Think I stole it?

22
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,762
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.

23
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:19,602
He gave it to me
for a favor I'd done him.

24
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:22,681
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

25
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:25,362
You funny man, Shears.

26
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,959
You go on sick list. Him too.

27
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:35,765
One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him...

28
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,566
...then where'll we be?

29
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:42,365
Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.

30
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,566
Far away.

31
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,159
Okay, let's knock off.

32
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,761
Here lies...

33
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,206
I forgot who we just buried.

34
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:55,642
Thomson.

35
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,162
Ah, yes.

36
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:59,280
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

37
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:03,157
...serial number zero-one-two-
three-four-five-six-seven.

38
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:08,158
Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something...

39
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:12,761
...who died of beri-beri
in the year of our Lord, 1943...

40
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,358
...for the greater glory of...

41
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,599
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.

42
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:20,964
No need to mock the grave.

43
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,163
I don't mock the grave or the man.

44
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:27,159
May he rest in peace.

45
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:32,482
He found little of it
while he was alive.

46
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:26,838
"A" Company, mark time!

47
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:43,006
Mark time!

48
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,322
Halt.

49
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:01,287
Into line, left turn.

50
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,366
Stand easy.

51
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:15,162
We're going to be
busy gravediggers, Weaver.

52
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,561
Well done, well done.

53
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,203
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

54
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,359
You going to tell him the truth?

55
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:32,802
Of course not.

56
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,760
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

57
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,481
My name is Nicholson.

58
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,557
I am Colonel Saito.

59
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:27,564
In the name of His Imperial Majesty...

60
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,565
...I welcome you.

61
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:33,557
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

62
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,681
...which is Camp 16...

63
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,158
...along the great railroad...

64
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:44,363
...which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

65
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:49,596
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

66
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,885
...to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

67
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:57,887
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.

68
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:02,758
And officers will work as well as men.

69
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:08,123
The Japanese Army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.

70
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:13,121
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

71
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,767
But if you do not work hard...

72
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,436
...you will be punished.

73
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:24,163
A word to you about escape.

74
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:27,368
There is no barbed wire.

75
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,566
No stockade.

76
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,481
No watchtower.

77
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:35,001
They are not necessary.

78
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,768
We are an island in the jungle.

79
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:40,846
Escape is impossible.

80
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:43,762
You would die.

81
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,163
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.

82
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:55,247
Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:

83
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,201
"Be happy in your work."

84
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:59,757
Be happy in your work.

85
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,602
Dismissed.

86
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:11,484
Battalion, stand at ease.

87
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,081
Fall out, Major Hughes.

88
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:15,364
Battalion, stand easy.

89
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:18,563
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.

90
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:21,038
I'm going to have a word
with this fellow.

91
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,957
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

92
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:32,758
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.

93
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:36,199
My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

94
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,361
You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labor...

95
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,923
...is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

96
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:44,322
Is that so?

97
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,166
I have a copy of the convention...

98
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,246
...and would be glad to
let you glance through it.

99
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,758
That will not be necessary.

100
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,160
Sit down, please.

101
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:45,802
Yes, sir.

102
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,357
I'm going to have a word with Clipton.

103
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,802
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

104
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,766
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.

105
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:38,318
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

106
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:39,722
How do you do, sir?

107
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,566
We found him and an Australian.

108
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,759
All that's left of the
prisoners who built the camp.

109
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:45,600
U.S. Navy? Out here?

110
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,759
I am sort of landlocked.

111
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:50,078
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.

112
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:53,604
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

113
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:55,201
And your group here?

114
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:57,564
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

115
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:59,963
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

116
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,760
And what happened to them?

117
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,367
They died...

118
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:08,559
...of malaria, dysentery,
beri-beri, gangrene.

119
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,002
Other causes of death:

120
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:14,161
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites...

121
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,041
...Saito.

122
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:19,447
Then there were some
who just got tired of living.

123
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,882
Has Clipton seen you?

124
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:24,120
Just about to. Come over here,
you can shave later.

125
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,447
All right.

126
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,765
You'll stay with the officers.

127
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,600
We'll find some decent clothing.

128
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,207
Don't bother about me.

129
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:36,564
I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.

130
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,527
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion here.

131
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,798
The officers in your party
did manual labor?

132
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:43,646
I think you could call it that.

133
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,961
I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.

134
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:48,362
Saito.

135
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:51,366
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?

136
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:54,760
Yes. I must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.

137
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:56,805
Well, I must be pushing on.

138
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,766
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

139
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:01,761
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.

140
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,682
Anything we can do.

141
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:05,520
Thank you, sir.

142
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,998
- What is it?
- Never mind.

143
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,567
Go on, say it.

144
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,807
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito...

145
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:18,358
...but reasonable, that's a new one.

146
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:21,566
Perhaps Col. Nicholson
defines the word differently.

147
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:31,402
Any other points?

148
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,047
- By your leave, sir?
- Jennings?

149
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:36,200
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Cmd. Shears...

150
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,200
There won't be any escape committee.

151
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,882
I don't understand, sir.
Lt. Jennings has a plan.

152
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,801
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?

153
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:48,280
Where? Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.

154
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:52,362
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.

155
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:56,564
I'm sure a man of Cmdr. Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

156
00:17:56,848 --> 00:18:00,397
I'd say that the odds against a
successful escape are 100 to one.

157
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:02,356
But may I add another word?

158
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:03,802
Please.

159
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:07,045
The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.

160
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:10,166
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.

161
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:11,562
To give up hope of escape...

162
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:15,005
...to stop thinking about it
means accepting a death sentence.

163
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:17,808
Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?

164
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:21,757
I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.

165
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,959
I understand how you feel.

166
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:28,880
Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.

167
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:31,881
But my men and I are
involved in a curious legal point...

168
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,198
...of which you are unaware.

169
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,963
In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.

170
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:39,806
Ordered, mind you.

171
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:44,366
Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.

172
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:45,802
Interesting point, sir.

173
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:48,482
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.

174
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:52,158
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

175
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,968
Without law, commander,
there is no civilization.

176
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,446
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilization.

177
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:01,367
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

178
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:04,562
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

179
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:08,159
Is there anything else?

180
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,759
I think we're
clear on the program.

181
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:16,478
I want everything to go off smoothly
starting tomorrow morning.

182
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,201
And remember this:

183
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,360
Our men must always feel they are
still commanded by us...

184
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,485
...and not by the Japanese.

185
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:27,801
So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

186
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:30,039
Are you with me there, commander?

187
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:37,365
I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.

188
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,638
As for me, I'm just a slave.

189
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,884
A living slave.

190
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:56,765
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

191
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:59,882
He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.

192
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:02,541
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.

193
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:19,257
English prisoners!

194
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:24,860
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

195
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:30,704
From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.

196
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:36,463
You will finish the bridge
by the twelfth day of May.

197
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:41,744
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.

198
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:48,898
Time is short. All men will work.

199
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,062
Your officers will work beside you.

200
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:53,980
This is only just...

201
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,058
...for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.

202
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:00,736
Your shame is their dishonor.

203
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,379
It is they who told you...

204
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:08,019
...better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.

205
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:11,385
It is they who brought you here,
not I.

206
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:16,863
Therefore, they will join you
in useful labor.

207
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,061
That is all.

208
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:23,182
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

209
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:25,862
Bradley, back in your place.

210
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:34,468
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

211
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,262
...to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

212
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:40,502
"Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war...

213
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,704
...who are fit,
other than officers..."

214
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:44,142
Give me the book.

215
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,822
By all means.
You read English, I take it?

216
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:49,098
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.

217
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:52,465
If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.

218
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:54,579
You see, the Code states that...

219
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,668
Stand fast in the ranks.

220
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,618
You speak to me of Code?

221
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,261
What "Code"?

222
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:06,584
The coward's code!

223
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:10,183
What do you know
of the soldier's code?

224
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:13,465
Of bushido? Nothing!

225
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,063
You are unworthy of command!

226
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,385
If you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilized world...

227
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:35,098
...we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.

228
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:38,465
My officers will not do manual labor.

229
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:40,341
We shall see.

230
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:47,062
All enlisted prisoners to work.

231
00:22:57,348 --> 00:23:00,260
Sergeant Major! Take the men to work.

232
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:04,062
Battalion, take up tools.

233
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:10,866
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!

234
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,660
"A" Company, by the right,
quick march.

235
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:19,181
Eyes right.

236
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:22,058
Eyes right.

237
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:31,259
Eyes front.

238
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:42,857
Quick march, eyes right.

239
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:56,264
"C" Company, by the right.

240
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,226
What's he up to?

241
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,467
Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.

242
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:21,581
Now, you will be reasonable.

243
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,903
You will order your officers to work.

244
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,342
No.

245
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:58,259
I will count three.

246
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,379
If by the third count...

247
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:04,860
...you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

248
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:07,662
...I will give the order to fire.

249
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,861
He's going to do it.

250
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:21,778
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

251
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,902
One.

252
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,627
I warn you, Colonel...

253
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:36,261
Two.

254
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:40,501
Stop!

255
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:48,068
Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.

256
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,099
So has every man in the hospital.

257
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,667
They're too many witnesses.

258
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:55,742
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.

259
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:01,823
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?

260
00:27:10,828 --> 00:27:14,867
You see, Jennings, there are
advantages to being on the sick list.

261
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,906
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.

262
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:20,298
"Into the valley of death
rode the 600."

263
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:21,867
How's that, sir?

264
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,987
That kind of guts.

265
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,900
Also the kind they had in 1914...

266
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:28,708
...when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.

267
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:32,065
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.

268
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:35,067
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

269
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:17,657
Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.

270
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:21,666
Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.

271
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:23,861
What about him?

272
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:27,381
He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.

273
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:32,258
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

274
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:34,827
Here we go again.

275
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:47,863
Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.

276
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:49,861
Tell them to go.

277
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:59,186
Not you.

278
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:13,742
Come.

279
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:35,620
Leave him alone!

280
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:38,986
Leave him alone!

281
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:31,663
They're going to put him in the oven.

282
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:56,663
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

283
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:01,223
For he's a jolly good fellow

284
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:03,618
And so say all of us

285
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:08,458
And so say all of us
And so say all of us

286
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:13,583
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

287
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:17,099
For he's a jolly good fellow

288
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:19,623
And so say all of us

289
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:24,744
Timber!

290
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:32,585
One, two, three, four.

291
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,623
One, two, three, four.

292
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:42,066
No, no, no!

293
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:43,936
Let go!

294
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:46,702
Let go!

295
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:34,387
You wish to see me?

296
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,744
I've tried to see you for three days.

297
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,946
It's about the colonel.
He's been shut up in that hut...

298
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,904
I could have you shot.

299
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:49,586
Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.

300
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,581
I knew nothing about the escape.

301
00:34:52,468 --> 00:34:54,299
It does not matter.

302
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:57,306
One must respect those who tried.

303
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:01,143
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

304
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:03,026
...they were soldiers again.

305
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:07,946
But it is insane to try and escape.

306
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:12,306
Two soldiers shot
and the third drowned.

307
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:13,947
To what end?

308
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:16,901
It was an escape from reality.

309
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:26,506
There is your reality.

310
00:35:26,788 --> 00:35:31,304
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.

311
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:35,218
And this shows the position
of actual progress.

312
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:41,824
Because of your colonel's stubbornness,
we are far behind schedule.

313
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:43,023
That is not all.

314
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:46,462
Enlisted prisoners sabotaged the work.

315
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:50,456
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.

316
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:53,217
Then who would build your bridge?

317
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:55,345
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

318
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:58,500
The men don't work well
without their own officers.

319
00:35:58,748 --> 00:36:03,344
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.

320
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,380
That's for Nicholson to decide.

321
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:07,300
As he said,
it's against the rules.

322
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,544
Do not speak to me of rules.

323
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:11,506
This is war!

324
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:13,705
This is not a game of cricket.

325
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:20,104
He's mad, your colonel...

326
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:23,306
...quite mad.

327
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:27,096
Sit down, please.

328
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:36,178
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

329
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,822
Thank you.

330
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:42,342
Tell him that if his officers
will not work...

331
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:45,421
...I'll be forced
to close the hospital...

332
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,899
...and your patients will
work in their place.

333
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:53,300
Many will die,
and he will be responsible.

334
00:36:53,948 --> 00:36:57,827
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

335
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,183
Doc's going to see the old man.

336
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,102
Sir...

337
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:38,707
It's Clipton, sir.

338
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:42,500
I brought you a few things.

339
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:50,062
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.

340
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:54,301
We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.

341
00:37:57,268 --> 00:37:58,781
And the officers?

342
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,542
Not so good.
They're still in detention.

343
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:05,906
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.

344
00:38:06,508 --> 00:38:08,544
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.

345
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:12,098
Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.

346
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:16,624
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

347
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,938
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?

348
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:21,907
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

349
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:28,422
I'm going to clean you up a little
while I talk.

350
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:30,704
I've got something to tell you.

351
00:38:30,948 --> 00:38:33,303
I've just had a word with Saito.

352
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:37,064
That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

353
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:40,226
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.

354
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,936
Blackmail!

355
00:38:58,188 --> 00:39:02,625
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.

356
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:06,338
It's a question of face, pure and
simple. And he can't give in.

357
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,818
It's still blackmail.

358
00:39:10,988 --> 00:39:15,300
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

359
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:20,503
Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

360
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:25,542
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.

361
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:28,706
But Saito's cut their food rations...

362
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:30,939
...and if he makes
the sick men work...

363
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:34,817
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.

364
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:37,747
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

365
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:40,422
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.

366
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:44,297
If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.

367
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:51,501
Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.

368
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:56,224
We're under a man who'll stop at
nothing to get his way. Principle!

369
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:00,417
No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.

370
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,066
Give in, sir. Please!

371
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:04,707
I'm adamant.

372
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:08,497
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

373
00:40:08,748 --> 00:40:10,340
- Time.
- All right.

374
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:15,907
Please thank those concerned.

375
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:18,907
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

376
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:20,706
Reynolds stole the coconut.

377
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:24,902
We'll be able to get you
food sometimes.

378
00:40:25,148 --> 00:40:27,503
We've bribed one of your guards.

379
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:36,985
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

380
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:39,027
Many thanks.

381
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:48,624
Did you say that American
was killed?

382
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:50,904
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

383
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:55,301
It's insane to plan escapes.

384
00:40:56,308 --> 00:40:59,220
Three men killed, and to what end?

385
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,662
Time!

386
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:03,823
Here is where we must win through.

387
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:27,101
Doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.

388
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:30,744
Means only one thing,
the colonel won't give in.

389
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:44,262
Well?

390
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,101
It's like this.

391
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:48,908
Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

392
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:51,184
It's a question of principle.

393
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,745
As medical officer, I protest
the way he's being treated.

394
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:56,865
It's a wonder he's still alive.

395
00:41:57,068 --> 00:42:00,902
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

396
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:05,064
He is responsible.

397
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:07,661
Not I.

398
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,061
You sick?

399
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,658
Are they both mad?

400
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:28,059
Or am I going mad?

401
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:31,307
Or is it the sun?

402
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:27,861
Attention!

403
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:31,662
Battalion, attention.

404
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:36,464
English prisoners.

405
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:39,063
Let us ask the question...

406
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:42,345
...why does the bridge not progress?

407
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:47,783
You know why,
because your officers are lazy!

408
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:52,261
They think themselves too good
to share your burden.

409
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:54,707
This is not just.

410
00:45:54,948 --> 00:45:57,985
Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.

411
00:45:58,628 --> 00:46:02,018
Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.

412
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:04,704
But there is another cause.

413
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:07,860
I do not hide the truth.

414
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:10,857
With deep shame and regret...

415
00:46:11,108 --> 00:46:13,303
...I admit to you the failure...

416
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:16,267
...of a member of the Japanese staff.

417
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:18,618
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

418
00:46:19,348 --> 00:46:21,179
He is a bad engineer.

419
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:23,578
He is unworthy of command.

420
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:28,340
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

421
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:33,857
Tomorrow we begin again.

422
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:37,459
I shall be in personal command.

423
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:39,939
Today we rest.

424
00:46:41,828 --> 00:46:46,265
All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy!

425
00:46:46,748 --> 00:46:50,058
As token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

426
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,742
...I give presents to you all.

427
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:06,857
Let us be happy in our work.

428
00:47:07,748 --> 00:47:10,387
Company, dismissed.

429
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:15,064
Battalion, dismissed.

430
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:31,177
Hey, take a look at this.

431
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,988
Red Cross! He's given us our...

432
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:37,061
Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

433
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:40,465
"Tomorrow we begin again."

434
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:41,321
Hey, Harry, look!

435
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:44,239
They're letting the old man out.

436
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:08,760
Most likely going to give him
another pasting.

437
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:52,681
Good evening, colonel.

438
00:49:59,448 --> 00:50:01,359
Do you mind sitting over here?

439
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:04,966
I am having rather a late supper.

440
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:29,358
English corned beef.

441
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:31,761
No, thank you.

442
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:39,285
Produce of Scotland.

443
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:43,078
I prefer it to sake.

444
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:46,122
I spent three years in London,
you know.

445
00:50:46,568 --> 00:50:49,878
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

446
00:50:51,368 --> 00:50:52,721
Cheers!

447
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:54,481
Sorry.

448
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:56,480
Later, perhaps?

449
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:58,286
Perhaps.

450
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:05,878
I was not a good artist.

451
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:08,318
My father disapproved.

452
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:10,877
He felt I belonged in the army.

453
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:15,477
So I changed from art to engineering.

454
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:20,079
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

455
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:23,917
I intend to make a full report
of your activities.

456
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:32,683
I do not think you
quite realize my position.

457
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:36,319
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.

458
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:40,322
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

459
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:43,128
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.

460
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:47,919
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

461
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,887
No officers, except
for administration.

462
00:51:51,088 --> 00:51:55,081
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

463
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,886
You know it. I know it.

464
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:59,886
I'm not responsible
for other officers.

465
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:01,521
Personally, I'm appalled.

466
00:52:01,728 --> 00:52:04,037
Let's not get excited.

467
00:52:09,488 --> 00:52:10,887
Will you have a cigar?

468
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,999
No. Thank you.

469
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:18,284
When I said all officers must work...

470
00:52:18,488 --> 00:52:21,798
...naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

471
00:52:22,048 --> 00:52:26,087
My orders were only intended
for officers below...

472
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,279
No officers will do manual labor.

473
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:31,679
Please! I was about to say:

474
00:52:31,888 --> 00:52:35,085
I've thought the matter over
and have decided...

475
00:52:35,328 --> 00:52:39,606
...to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

476
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:42,487
...leaving only junior officers
to work.

477
00:52:42,688 --> 00:52:46,124
No. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.

478
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:03,719
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

479
00:53:03,968 --> 00:53:05,526
I haven't the foggiest.

480
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,282
I'd have to kill myself.

481
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,288
What would you do if you were me?

482
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:14,282
I suppose if I were you...

483
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:17,078
...I'd have to kill myself.

484
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:20,356
Cheers.

485
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:24,002
I warn you, colonel...

486
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:28,526
...if I am to die,
others will die before me.

487
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:29,962
Do you understand?

488
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,722
Clipton did mention that.

489
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:35,317
That won't solve your problem.

490
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:37,877
I'm sure we can
arrive at a solution.

491
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:39,686
Please sit down.

492
00:53:42,768 --> 00:53:46,078
Now. Tell me, colonel...

493
00:53:46,528 --> 00:53:49,918
...do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

494
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:51,965
- Of course.
- Good.

495
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:55,562
Now.

496
00:53:58,048 --> 00:53:59,879
Take this bridge of yours.

497
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:02,684
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

498
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:06,881
Frankly, I doubt whether
your Lieutenant what's-his-name...

499
00:54:07,128 --> 00:54:08,880
Miura.

500
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:13,483
...is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.

501
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:18,880
On the other hand, I have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance...

502
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:22,678
...who have built bridges
all over India.

503
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:25,281
The men respect them.

504
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:29,043
It's essential for an officer
to have that respect.

505
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:31,318
If it's gone, he ceases to command.

506
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,877
What then?
Demoralization and chaos.

507
00:54:34,128 --> 00:54:37,484
A poor commander I would be if
I allowed that to happen.

508
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:42,643
Perhaps you are not aware that
the bridge is now under my command.

509
00:54:42,968 --> 00:54:46,483
Really? And may I ask, are you
satisfied with the work?

510
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:48,918
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.

511
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:51,284
I hate the British!

512
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,525
You are defeated
but you have no shame.

513
00:54:54,768 --> 00:54:57,077
You are stubborn
but have no pride.

514
00:54:57,328 --> 00:55:00,206
You endure
but you have no courage.

515
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:02,120
I hate the British!

516
00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:04,999
Pointless, going on like this.

517
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,442
Stay there!

518
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:36,684
Stand down. Stand down!

519
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:48,197
Battalion, attention!

520
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:29,207
Battalion, stand at ease.

521
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,081
Please...

522
00:59:34,248 --> 00:59:37,081
Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?

523
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:38,961
I've lost count.

524
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,881
It's the anniversary of
our great victory...

525
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:44,727
...over Russia in 1905.

526
00:59:44,968 --> 00:59:48,927
Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.

527
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,920
In honor of this occasion...

528
00:59:51,168 --> 00:59:53,762
...I have given your troops
a day of rest.

529
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,202
Many thanks.

530
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:58,326
I am declaring a general amnesty.

531
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:01,924
You and your officers may
return to your quarters.

532
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:04,318
As part of this amnesty...

533
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:09,603
...it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labor.

534
01:00:38,608 --> 01:00:39,802
He's done it!

535
01:02:56,968 --> 01:02:59,118
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

536
01:03:10,488 --> 01:03:12,160
How many men in your party?

537
01:03:12,408 --> 01:03:14,285
I don't really know, sir.

538
01:03:14,528 --> 01:03:16,564
- You don't know?
- Twelve, usually.

539
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:19,959
One of the men took sick
this morning, sir.

540
01:03:20,168 --> 01:03:23,399
It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.

541
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:28,518
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

542
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:32,323
A corporal should know
how many men he has under him.

543
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:34,719
Oh, yes, sir.

544
01:03:35,608 --> 01:03:39,123
Have you a nervous affliction?
Stop making those faces.

545
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:44,761
It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behavior.

546
01:03:45,008 --> 01:03:46,123
No, sir.

547
01:03:49,768 --> 01:03:52,328
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

548
01:04:01,808 --> 01:04:04,117
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?

549
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:07,718
Ever built a bridge
over a stream like the Kwai?

550
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:11,364
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them
in Madras, Bengal...

551
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:13,519
If this were your bridge...

552
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:16,324
...how would you get it under way?

553
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:19,960
Get it under way, sir?

554
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,722
First of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

555
01:04:22,968 --> 01:04:25,038
Oh, why not?

556
01:04:25,288 --> 01:04:26,767
I was trying to tell you...

557
01:04:27,008 --> 01:04:30,717
...the Japanese couldn't have
picked a worse location.

558
01:04:31,408 --> 01:04:33,319
You see those piles?

559
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:35,126
They're sinking.

560
01:04:37,408 --> 01:04:41,117
We could drive those logs
forever and they wouldn't hold.

561
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:43,319
Where would you build it?

562
01:04:44,408 --> 01:04:47,366
Further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.

563
01:04:47,608 --> 01:04:50,327
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

564
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:55,120
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

565
01:04:55,528 --> 01:04:59,441
Not the way they're doing it.
It's chaos, as you can see.

566
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:03,324
Uncoordinated activity.

567
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:05,126
No teamwork.

568
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:09,725
Some parties are working
against each other.

569
01:05:11,928 --> 01:05:13,122
Yes.

570
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:19,525
I say, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.

571
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:22,362
Thanks to the Japanese,
we command a rabble.

572
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:24,917
There's no order, no discipline.

573
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:29,166
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.

574
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:31,160
Which isn't going to be easy.

575
01:05:31,408 --> 01:05:34,764
Fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.

576
01:05:35,008 --> 01:05:37,317
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.

577
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:44,124
We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that'll put them to shame.

578
01:05:44,328 --> 01:05:46,922
Show what a British
soldier is capable of.

579
01:05:47,168 --> 01:05:49,728
Yes. I see your point, sir.

580
01:05:49,928 --> 01:05:52,567
I know how difficult
it's going to be here...

581
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:55,163
...where you can't find what you need.

582
01:05:55,408 --> 01:05:58,320
- There's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

583
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:00,957
You really want them
to build the bridge?

584
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,722
You're not usually
so slow in the uptake.

585
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:06,761
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

586
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,920
If there weren't any work,
we'd invent some.

587
01:06:10,168 --> 01:06:12,921
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.

588
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,557
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

589
01:06:15,808 --> 01:06:17,844
Here again I know the men.

590
01:06:18,088 --> 01:06:20,966
It's essential that they
take pride in their job.

591
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,721
- Right, men?
- Yes, sir.

592
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:25,726
Reeves, you're
the key man here as engineer.

593
01:06:25,968 --> 01:06:29,722
Tell me what you want and we'll
get it. Can we make a go of it?

594
01:06:29,928 --> 01:06:32,123
- We'll do out best, sir.
- Fine.

595
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:35,517
We must draw up our plans...

596
01:06:36,128 --> 01:06:38,722
...then arrange a conference
with Saito...

597
01:06:39,408 --> 01:06:41,319
...and set him straight.

598
01:06:43,968 --> 01:06:47,119
That takes care of all
the procedural matters.

599
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:49,521
Oh, yes.

600
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:53,748
The next point is unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.

601
01:06:54,008 --> 01:06:57,523
Sorry to say, the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily...

602
01:06:57,728 --> 01:06:59,923
...and, I have to add, incorrectly.

603
01:07:02,568 --> 01:07:03,637
Incorrectly?

604
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:05,321
Unfortunately, yes.

605
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:08,162
Our engineer has made
a study of the site...

606
01:07:08,408 --> 01:07:11,605
...and decided that the river bottom
there is too soft.

607
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:13,602
Too soft?

608
01:07:13,848 --> 01:07:16,203
Mud! All the work
has been useless.

609
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:19,308
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.

610
01:07:19,608 --> 01:07:24,523
Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.

611
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:27,447
It would collapse
under the first train.

612
01:07:27,688 --> 01:07:31,761
The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.

613
01:07:31,968 --> 01:07:36,883
Reeves, before you get too involved...
Colonel, could we have a cup of tea?

614
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:53,356
I take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

615
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:58,523
...we build a new bridge, at the site
picked by Reeves, 400 yards downstream.

616
01:08:01,968 --> 01:08:04,128
Let's proceed to the next point.

617
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:07,522
I decided to alter
the work quota of our men.

618
01:08:07,728 --> 01:08:09,366
- Alter?
- I've increased it.

619
01:08:09,608 --> 01:08:12,042
From 1.5 yards of earth moved
to two.

620
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,927
I'm sure it will
meet with your approval.

621
01:08:15,128 --> 01:08:18,325
Hughes has all the facts.
Would you take over?

622
01:08:18,768 --> 01:08:21,441
I've done a time study
of the entire project.

623
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:25,363
You see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

624
01:08:25,608 --> 01:08:29,157
I'd urge we revise the
organization of the working parties.

625
01:08:29,408 --> 01:08:34,323
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.

626
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,923
Would it be possible
to have dinner?

627
01:08:37,168 --> 01:08:38,317
Of course.

628
01:08:41,728 --> 01:08:43,127
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

629
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:47,037
If we increase the squads
and specialize their functions...

630
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:51,440
...I'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30%.

631
01:08:51,688 --> 01:08:54,725
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point...

632
01:08:55,528 --> 01:09:00,318
Now, there's another important
decision that can't be postponed.

633
01:09:00,568 --> 01:09:02,718
As the British
will work on the bridge...

634
01:09:02,968 --> 01:09:05,766
...only a few will be available
for railway work.

635
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:10,718
I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang...

636
01:09:10,928 --> 01:09:15,319
...so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.

637
01:09:16,368 --> 01:09:18,723
I have already given the order.

638
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:21,926
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

639
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:25,916
I thought to set it at 1.5 yards
so as not to overtire them...

640
01:09:26,168 --> 01:09:28,762
...but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?

641
01:09:29,008 --> 01:09:32,125
That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.

642
01:09:33,968 --> 01:09:37,085
I have already given the order.

643
01:09:37,328 --> 01:09:39,762
We'll try to surpass that,
won't we, Hughes?

644
01:09:40,008 --> 01:09:42,841
I think that completes
the agenda for tonight.

645
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:46,364
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

646
01:09:46,608 --> 01:09:49,361
Are there any other questions?

647
01:09:50,768 --> 01:09:52,326
One question.

648
01:09:53,008 --> 01:09:55,363
Can you finish the bridge in time?

649
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,964
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.

650
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:01,517
But we'll certainly give it a go.

651
01:10:02,728 --> 01:10:06,846
Don't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement...

652
01:10:07,088 --> 01:10:08,840
...for which I was not to blame.

653
01:10:10,408 --> 01:10:12,126
Is there anything else?

654
01:10:12,888 --> 01:10:13,923
No.

655
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:18,316
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

656
01:10:19,408 --> 01:10:21,922
- Good night.
- Good night.

657
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:49,320
I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

658
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:53,125
For now I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

659
01:10:53,888 --> 01:10:56,527
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.

660
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:00,559
By the way, I meant to tell you...

661
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:03,527
...there are trees here
similar to elm.

662
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:07,516
And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

663
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:10,726
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.

664
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,918
Six hundred years.

665
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:16,524
That would be quite something.

666
01:12:03,608 --> 01:12:07,157
I'm looking for an American
named Commander Shears.

667
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:10,525
- Yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.

668
01:12:17,928 --> 01:12:19,122
Kiss!

669
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,708
Too many eyes.

670
01:12:22,008 --> 01:12:25,921
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas...

671
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,561
All I need is love.

672
01:12:27,808 --> 01:12:30,527
It's true.
All you really need is love.

673
01:12:35,128 --> 01:12:38,120
Why are you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

674
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,563
Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.

675
01:12:40,808 --> 01:12:42,844
And I always follow my heart.

676
01:12:43,088 --> 01:12:44,316
Kiss.

677
01:12:52,528 --> 01:12:54,519
How's that, commander?

678
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:57,120
Don't call me commander.

679
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:58,647
It's unromantic.

680
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:00,526
You're an officer yourself.

681
01:13:00,728 --> 01:13:03,561
How'd you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

682
01:13:03,808 --> 01:13:06,163
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."

683
01:13:06,368 --> 01:13:07,437
Yes, sir.

684
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:10,641
Brass ahoy.

685
01:13:11,368 --> 01:13:13,120
He wants you. He's all yours.

686
01:13:13,328 --> 01:13:15,717
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me!

687
01:13:17,328 --> 01:13:18,761
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.

688
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:20,726
My name's Warden.

689
01:13:21,088 --> 01:13:22,646
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...

690
01:13:22,888 --> 01:13:25,243
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it.

691
01:13:25,448 --> 01:13:26,437
Like a martini?

692
01:13:26,688 --> 01:13:28,360
That's very kind.
I think not.

693
01:13:28,608 --> 01:13:29,723
Mind if I have one?

694
01:13:29,968 --> 01:13:31,242
How did you get that?

695
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:34,719
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

696
01:13:34,968 --> 01:13:37,323
Yes, of course. Jolly good.

697
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:40,117
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

698
01:13:40,368 --> 01:13:43,758
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 316.

699
01:13:44,008 --> 01:13:46,363
Our headquarters is in
the Botanical Gardens.

700
01:13:46,608 --> 01:13:49,725
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.

701
01:13:50,408 --> 01:13:52,717
- Sure you won't have one?
- No, thanks.

702
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:56,716
We have an interest
in that railway you worked on.

703
01:13:56,968 --> 01:14:00,119
You could give us no end
of valuable information.

704
01:14:00,328 --> 01:14:03,718
Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

705
01:14:03,928 --> 01:14:06,920
...and I told your people
everything I know.

706
01:14:07,168 --> 01:14:10,365
But you could help us
in a rather special sense.

707
01:14:10,608 --> 01:14:15,523
I know it's a terrible imposition, but
could you possibly come out and see us?

708
01:14:16,968 --> 01:14:19,766
If you want to go over
the whole thing again.

709
01:14:20,008 --> 01:14:22,568
Very kind.
Lord Louis'll be grateful.

710
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:23,957
- Who?
- Mountbatten.

711
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:26,722
We're one of his special pigeons.

712
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:30,523
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car.

713
01:14:30,728 --> 01:14:32,719
This evening? Out of the question.

714
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,118
Tomorrow morning then?
About 10?

715
01:14:35,408 --> 01:14:37,763
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.

716
01:14:38,008 --> 01:14:40,124
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

717
01:14:40,328 --> 01:14:41,522
Good luck.

718
01:14:42,408 --> 01:14:43,523
Thanks.

719
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:54,917
You're sorry, but
you're going to stand me up tonight.

720
01:14:55,128 --> 01:14:57,119
You couldn't be more wrong.

721
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:03,848
General salute!

722
01:15:04,088 --> 01:15:05,760
Present arms!

723
01:15:19,008 --> 01:15:21,727
- May I see your pass, please?
- Oh, yes.

724
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:36,926
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.

725
01:15:48,288 --> 01:15:51,519
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

726
01:15:51,928 --> 01:15:55,125
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man.

727
01:15:57,608 --> 01:16:00,328
On your feet!
Away to the debriefing room.

728
01:16:00,528 --> 01:16:02,917
Come on, move yourselves!
Move quickly!

729
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:09,317
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

730
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:13,361
Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.

731
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:16,122
You see, he's gained the initiative.

732
01:16:16,328 --> 01:16:19,957
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

733
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,324
- You're sorry?
- So am I.

734
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:25,719
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.

735
01:16:25,968 --> 01:16:29,722
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

736
01:16:30,728 --> 01:16:33,925
- What can I do for you?
- I'm going to see Major Warden.

737
01:16:34,168 --> 01:16:38,348
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

738
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:47,325
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.

739
01:16:47,528 --> 01:16:51,528
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

740
01:16:53,688 --> 01:16:55,918
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?

741
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:57,527
Good of you to come.

742
01:16:57,768 --> 01:17:00,362
- They took care of you?
- They certainly have.

743
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:03,566
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.

744
01:17:03,808 --> 01:17:06,527
Col. Green is looking forward
to meeting you.

745
01:17:07,888 --> 01:17:12,803
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Didn't know it was a commando school.

746
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:17,724
We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.

747
01:17:18,128 --> 01:17:19,322
What do you do here?

748
01:17:19,528 --> 01:17:21,837
Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.

749
01:17:22,088 --> 01:17:24,966
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful.

750
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,722
That pop was made
with a lump half this size.

751
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:31,278
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
at half the weight.

752
01:17:32,488 --> 01:17:35,321
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

753
01:17:35,688 --> 01:17:37,121
Thanks for telling me.

754
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:40,638
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.

755
01:17:40,848 --> 01:17:43,123
You can do what you like with it.

756
01:17:43,968 --> 01:17:45,526
This is my place.

757
01:17:50,768 --> 01:17:52,121
Go ahead.

758
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:58,144
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

759
01:17:59,465 --> 01:18:01,615
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

760
01:18:01,825 --> 01:18:03,941
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

761
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:07,143
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.

762
01:18:10,905 --> 01:18:12,179
Do you read this?

763
01:18:12,425 --> 01:18:16,134
I taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.

764
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:23,341
I never congratulated you
on your escape. Good show!

765
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:27,254
If your sea rescue plane hadn't
spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

766
01:18:27,505 --> 01:18:29,143
No, I suppose not.

767
01:18:32,225 --> 01:18:34,739
Would you like to see where you were?

768
01:18:35,665 --> 01:18:36,541
All right.

769
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:41,575
Our information's scanty.
It's based on your report.

770
01:18:41,825 --> 01:18:43,543
We think the camp's here.

771
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:47,425
Do your people have any idea
what happened to Col. Nicholson?

772
01:18:47,705 --> 01:18:51,584
He had guts. They were about to
shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

773
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:54,862
If you're about to be shot
there's not much you can do.

774
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:59,425
Here is the river Kwai, and here's
the village where you were helped.

775
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:01,138
Here is the railway.

776
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:03,939
You must be fairly familiar
with this area.

777
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:06,579
No, I was out of my head
half the time.

778
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:10,261
The railway starts down here
in Singapore. Malaya...

779
01:19:10,505 --> 01:19:15,181
...Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea
is to drive on through, into India.

780
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:18,735
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.

781
01:19:18,985 --> 01:19:23,740
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-
Rangoon section by the middle of May.

782
01:19:23,945 --> 01:19:26,025
We'll try to prevent them.

783
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:28,944
It's too far for bombers
to carry a load.

784
01:19:29,145 --> 01:19:31,375
We'll have to go smash it
on the ground.

785
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:34,139
- How?
- Parachute drop, then march.

786
01:19:34,345 --> 01:19:37,143
With demolition equipment
through that jungle?

787
01:19:37,745 --> 01:19:41,579
Our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge.

788
01:19:41,825 --> 01:19:44,259
You see, none of us have
ever been there.

789
01:19:44,505 --> 01:19:47,577
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.

790
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:52,535
Col. Green's given me the Kwai bridge.
I'm taking a team in to blow it up.

791
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:54,738
Lucky you.

792
01:19:57,345 --> 01:19:58,744
Sure you won't have tea?

793
01:19:58,945 --> 01:20:03,336
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude,
but I've got a date at 2.

794
01:20:03,585 --> 01:20:07,134
- If there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.

795
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:12,743
Well, there is only
one question, actually.

796
01:20:13,145 --> 01:20:15,340
How would you feel about going back?

797
01:20:17,585 --> 01:20:18,495
Come again?

798
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:22,219
Under the circumstances
it's a bit much...

799
01:20:22,425 --> 01:20:25,462
...but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose.

800
01:20:25,705 --> 01:20:27,423
We'd love to have you with us.

801
01:20:29,505 --> 01:20:31,575
That's why you brought me here?

802
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:33,258
To ask me this?

803
01:20:33,505 --> 01:20:35,143
Well, frankly, yes.

804
01:20:35,345 --> 01:20:36,983
I just got out of there.

805
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:41,138
My escape was a miracle. Now
you want me to go back! Ridiculous!

806
01:20:41,345 --> 01:20:42,573
This is embarrassing...

807
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:46,340
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.

808
01:20:46,585 --> 01:20:50,339
Actually, Col. Green has taken
the matter up with your people.

809
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:54,220
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.

810
01:20:54,705 --> 01:20:58,061
A signal arrived yesterday morning
from the Pacific...

811
01:20:58,305 --> 01:21:02,184
...authorizing your temporary transfer
of duty to Force 316.

812
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:05,098
- They can't do this!
- I'm afraid they have.

813
01:21:05,905 --> 01:21:07,975
It was hard to break it to you.

814
01:21:08,225 --> 01:21:12,537
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake!

815
01:21:15,345 --> 01:21:20,185
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

816
01:21:20,425 --> 01:21:25,340
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just
an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

817
01:21:27,825 --> 01:21:31,659
When the Houston sunk, I made
it ashore with a real commander.

818
01:21:31,905 --> 01:21:34,942
We ran into a Japanese patrol.
He was killed.

819
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:38,342
I figured it was just
a matter of time till I...

820
01:21:38,585 --> 01:21:41,305
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

821
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:45,340
I thought officers would get better
treatment in prison camps.

822
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:49,021
But with Saito, the officers
worked along with the rest.

823
01:21:49,265 --> 01:21:51,699
There's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

824
01:21:53,745 --> 01:21:56,976
I kind of got used
to being a commander...

825
01:21:57,225 --> 01:21:59,375
...so when I arrived
at the hospital...

826
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:04,540
...I took a look at the enlisted men's
ward and then the officer's ward...

827
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:09,176
...and I said to myself, "Let's let
it ride along for a while."

828
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,063
There were certain advantages.

829
01:22:11,305 --> 01:22:13,057
I saw one of them on the beach.

830
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:15,378
That's the whole story.

831
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:19,379
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer...

832
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:22,378
...an American Commander Shears
who doesn't exist.

833
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,980
When the Navy learns the truth,
they'll say:

834
01:22:25,185 --> 01:22:27,904
"Ship him home
for impersonating an officer."

835
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,537
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?

836
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:34,140
Made! I'd like that drink now.

837
01:22:35,345 --> 01:22:37,495
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

838
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:42,455
I'll say I impersonated an officer
because I went crazy in the jungle.

839
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:47,540
I'm getting worse. Sometimes
I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

840
01:22:48,265 --> 01:22:49,903
It's quite a clever plan.

841
01:22:50,945 --> 01:22:53,095
Not only clever, it's foolproof.

842
01:22:53,345 --> 01:22:55,575
If my Navy finds out who I am...

843
01:22:55,825 --> 01:22:59,659
...those orders won't be worth
the paper they're written on.

844
01:23:12,825 --> 01:23:14,622
Isn't this your photograph?

845
01:23:17,465 --> 01:23:20,104
- Where did you get this?
- It took some doing...

846
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:22,654
...since your people
couldn't identify you.

847
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:27,496
Finally your C-in-C Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record.

848
01:23:27,745 --> 01:23:31,579
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?

849
01:23:33,585 --> 01:23:37,658
You see, we've known about your actual
rank for nearly a week.

850
01:23:40,465 --> 01:23:42,899
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

851
01:23:43,145 --> 01:23:45,225
In one sense you're a hero...

852
01:23:45,505 --> 01:23:48,065
...for making an escape
from the jungle.

853
01:23:48,265 --> 01:23:51,098
At the same time, they can't
bring you home...

854
01:23:51,305 --> 01:23:54,661
...and give you the Navy Cross for
impersonating an officer.

855
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:58,096
I suppose that's why they were
happy to hand you over.

856
01:23:58,345 --> 01:23:59,858
You see?

857
01:24:00,065 --> 01:24:01,134
Hot potato.

858
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:04,261
As far as your rank is concerned...

859
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:07,502
...we're fairly informal
about that in Force 316.

860
01:24:07,745 --> 01:24:10,020
You'd have the simulated
rank of major.

861
01:24:11,345 --> 01:24:14,860
A simulated major. That figures.

862
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:17,664
Well...

863
01:24:21,185 --> 01:24:24,025
As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.

864
01:24:24,945 --> 01:24:26,139
Good show!

865
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:29,183
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

866
01:24:29,425 --> 01:24:34,340
This is Major Shears. He volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge.

867
01:24:34,745 --> 01:24:36,064
Really?

868
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:38,697
Good show!

869
01:24:38,945 --> 01:24:41,664
Jolly good show, major!

870
01:25:29,065 --> 01:25:31,738
Get up to sick bay.
This foot's infected.

871
01:25:31,985 --> 01:25:33,976
Colonel might think I'm malingering.

872
01:25:34,225 --> 01:25:36,864
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking!

873
01:25:42,425 --> 01:25:46,054
Will someone tell me why
he wants to build a proper bridge?

874
01:25:46,305 --> 01:25:49,661
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.

875
01:25:59,665 --> 01:26:03,658
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.

876
01:26:04,345 --> 01:26:06,381
Fine job our chaps are doing.

877
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,855
Yes. How's he behaving?

878
01:26:09,105 --> 01:26:11,699
He's been most reasonable
since we took over.

879
01:26:11,945 --> 01:26:14,698
- What's he thinking?
- I haven't the foggiest.

880
01:26:14,945 --> 01:26:16,856
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.

881
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:18,864
What do you think?

882
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:22,257
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

883
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:28,497
Are you convinced that building
this bridge is a good idea?

884
01:26:28,745 --> 01:26:30,258
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.

885
01:26:30,505 --> 01:26:34,054
A good idea? Take another look.

886
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:38,699
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?

887
01:26:38,945 --> 01:26:40,901
Their condition has improved?

888
01:26:41,145 --> 01:26:43,579
Are they a happier lot
or aren't they?

889
01:26:43,825 --> 01:26:47,056
They feed better
and they are no longer abused.

890
01:26:47,305 --> 01:26:51,298
Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when I don't understand you at all.

891
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:53,376
I'll try to make myself clear.

892
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:57,334
The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as...

893
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:00,457
...forgive me, sir,
collaboration with the enemy.

894
01:27:00,705 --> 01:27:02,263
Perhaps even treason.

895
01:27:02,465 --> 01:27:06,378
We're prisoners of war. We haven't
the right to refuse to work.

896
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:09,745
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?

897
01:27:09,945 --> 01:27:12,857
Must we do better
than they could themselves?

898
01:27:13,865 --> 01:27:18,063
If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?

899
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,698
Would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness?

900
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,664
Or have it said
we can't do a proper job?

901
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:29,655
It's important to show them they
can't break us in body or in spirit.

902
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:32,061
Take a good look, Clipton.

903
01:27:32,865 --> 01:27:34,856
One day the war will be over.

904
01:27:35,065 --> 01:27:38,182
I hope that those who use the bridge
in years to come...

905
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:41,497
...will remember how it was built,
and who built it.

906
01:27:41,745 --> 01:27:46,660
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.

907
01:27:47,065 --> 01:27:49,295
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor...

908
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:52,264
...but you've a lot to learn
about the army.

909
01:28:15,025 --> 01:28:16,504
Hold him! Hold him!

910
01:28:16,745 --> 01:28:20,658
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?

911
01:28:27,665 --> 01:28:29,064
Good morning!

912
01:28:42,225 --> 01:28:45,058
What on earth
are you people staring at?

913
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,657
Get him with your boot!

914
01:29:01,745 --> 01:29:03,178
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

915
01:29:03,425 --> 01:29:07,100
Four minutes, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?

916
01:29:07,345 --> 01:29:09,859
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.

917
01:29:10,785 --> 01:29:13,299
Very ingenious. Warden was right.

918
01:29:13,545 --> 01:29:14,864
Sit down.

919
01:29:15,545 --> 01:29:19,697
I asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team.

920
01:29:19,945 --> 01:29:22,505
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.

921
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:25,784
Chapman wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts.

922
01:29:26,025 --> 01:29:29,654
He has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.

923
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:30,894
I've told you...

924
01:29:31,145 --> 01:29:35,377
...in this job, even when it's finished
there's always one more thing to do.

925
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,900
He's the best swimmer in the school.

926
01:29:38,145 --> 01:29:42,263
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.

927
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:47,456
All right, at ease.

928
01:29:52,065 --> 01:29:55,535
These men are thinking of taking you
for a hike in the jungle.

929
01:29:55,785 --> 01:29:57,059
Yes, sir.

930
01:29:57,705 --> 01:29:59,855
You were an accountant in Montreal?

931
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:02,175
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant.

932
01:30:02,425 --> 01:30:04,461
That is, I didn't have my charter.

933
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:06,018
Exactly what did you do?

934
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:10,053
Well, sir, I just checked columns
and columns of figures...

935
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:12,660
...which people had checked
before me...

936
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:16,175
...and other people checked them
after I had checked them.

937
01:30:16,425 --> 01:30:19,497
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a bore.

938
01:30:19,745 --> 01:30:21,258
How did you wind up here?

939
01:30:21,465 --> 01:30:26,380
In '39 I came over to London to enlist.
Later I volunteered for this work.

940
01:30:26,705 --> 01:30:30,220
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir. See, the regular Army...

941
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:32,023
Go ahead, you can be frank.

942
01:30:32,425 --> 01:30:37,294
Well, the regular Army reminded me
of my job in civilian life.

943
01:30:37,545 --> 01:30:39,661
They don't expect you to think.

944
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:43,457
Think about this.

945
01:30:43,745 --> 01:30:46,578
Are you sure you'd be able
to use it in cold blood?

946
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,253
I know how to use it.

947
01:30:48,505 --> 01:30:52,339
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?

948
01:30:52,585 --> 01:30:54,860
Could you kill without hesitation?

949
01:30:55,865 --> 01:31:00,780
That's a question I've asked myself.
It's worried me quite a bit.

950
01:31:01,225 --> 01:31:02,863
And what was the answer?

951
01:31:03,265 --> 01:31:05,256
I don't honestly know, sir.

952
01:31:05,945 --> 01:31:08,459
I've tried to imagine myself...

953
01:31:10,225 --> 01:31:14,059
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.

954
01:31:14,745 --> 01:31:16,622
It's an old army problem.

955
01:31:17,225 --> 01:31:20,262
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.

956
01:31:22,745 --> 01:31:24,144
Am I to go with the team?

957
01:31:25,585 --> 01:31:26,813
We'll let you know.

958
01:31:34,145 --> 01:31:35,260
You see what I mean.

959
01:31:35,465 --> 01:31:37,296
Well, at least he was honest.

960
01:31:37,545 --> 01:31:41,857
None of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises.

961
01:31:42,265 --> 01:31:44,256
What's your opinion, Shears?

962
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:46,378
Well, he's Canadian.

963
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:50,464
That fits with the international
composition of this outfit.

964
01:31:50,945 --> 01:31:53,175
If he wants to go,
he can take my place!

965
01:31:53,945 --> 01:31:57,301
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.

966
01:31:57,985 --> 01:32:00,897
I had an air reconnaissance
report on the village.

967
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:03,978
There's enough clearing
to make your jump at dusk.

968
01:32:04,225 --> 01:32:07,297
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.

969
01:32:07,505 --> 01:32:10,099
Blast! This is awkward.

970
01:32:10,345 --> 01:32:12,461
Silly, it never occurred to me!

971
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:14,020
Well, maybe...

972
01:32:14,265 --> 01:32:17,063
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.

973
01:32:17,305 --> 01:32:19,102
I'll go check right away.

974
01:32:19,345 --> 01:32:22,257
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.

975
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:26,700
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

976
01:32:26,945 --> 01:32:28,264
Yes, sir.

977
01:32:28,505 --> 01:32:31,065
You don't realize what a plum you are.

978
01:32:31,305 --> 01:32:34,661
Your knowledge of the area,
making friends in that village.

979
01:32:34,865 --> 01:32:38,858
It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.

980
01:32:41,545 --> 01:32:45,857
By the way, here's something that'll
interest you. The new "L" pill.

981
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:50,255
- L pill?
- L for lethal. Instant, painless.

982
01:32:50,465 --> 01:32:53,662
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.

983
01:32:53,865 --> 01:32:56,299
You're telling me
not to be taken alive.

984
01:32:56,545 --> 01:32:58,263
I wouldn't recommend it.

985
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:02,784
If any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind.

986
01:33:03,025 --> 01:33:05,255
The objective comes first in our work.

987
01:33:05,905 --> 01:33:10,296
You want my honest evaluation?
I didn't want to say in front of them.

988
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:12,263
I understand, go ahead.

989
01:33:13,665 --> 01:33:16,782
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.

990
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:19,664
Joyce is... He'll be okay.

991
01:33:19,905 --> 01:33:22,465
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh? Why not?

992
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:24,337
Cambridge don and all of that.

993
01:33:24,545 --> 01:33:27,981
It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers...

994
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:30,455
He's not without experience, you know.

995
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:35,093
When Singapore fell, he stayed behind
to blow up a couple of bridges.

996
01:33:35,345 --> 01:33:38,462
Many other installations
before the Japs caught him.

997
01:33:38,705 --> 01:33:42,061
- Fascinating story. He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.

998
01:33:42,305 --> 01:33:46,696
In view of time, they don't think
practice jumps would be worth it.

999
01:33:46,945 --> 01:33:50,699
If you make one jump there's
only a 50% chance of injury.

1000
01:33:50,945 --> 01:33:54,381
Two jumps, 80%. Three jumps,
you're bound to get your packet.

1001
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:58,379
The consensus is, the most
sensible thing for Shears to do...

1002
01:33:58,585 --> 01:34:01,463
...is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.

1003
01:34:01,705 --> 01:34:03,661
With or without parachute?

1004
01:34:08,545 --> 01:34:10,661
Oh, very good!

1005
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:15,663
With or without!

1006
01:35:10,505 --> 01:35:11,494
He's in the trees!

1007
01:35:48,905 --> 01:35:51,465
Yai says we can't
reach the Kwai your way.

1008
01:35:51,665 --> 01:35:55,905
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

1009
01:35:56,145 --> 01:35:58,101
- Then who's going to lead?
- Yai.

1010
01:35:58,345 --> 01:36:00,779
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.

1011
01:36:01,025 --> 01:36:03,664
Which means we shall have to
use women bearers.

1012
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:05,975
- Women bearers!
- They're capable.

1013
01:36:17,305 --> 01:36:20,263
He says it's dangerous
to spend the night here.

1014
01:36:20,505 --> 01:36:24,498
There's an enemy post three miles away
so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

1015
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:29,261
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.

1016
01:36:29,505 --> 01:36:31,063
Is there something wrong?

1017
01:36:32,145 --> 01:36:36,696
I was just thinking. You speak
Yai's language. I don't.

1018
01:36:36,945 --> 01:36:40,779
He's going to lead you
to the river by a route I never took.

1019
01:36:41,025 --> 01:36:44,495
Will someone tell me why I'm
so indispensable to this outfit?

1020
01:36:44,745 --> 01:36:48,863
I know how you feel, but there's
always the unexpected, isn't there?

1021
01:36:49,425 --> 01:36:51,063
Tell that to Chapman.

1022
01:36:51,345 --> 01:36:52,858
Let's get cracking!

1023
01:39:49,265 --> 01:39:50,857
You're lovely.

1024
01:39:53,305 --> 01:39:54,499
Lovely.

1025
01:39:54,745 --> 01:39:56,861
Be happy in your work!

1026
01:39:57,145 --> 01:39:58,260
Yes, sir.

1027
01:40:24,545 --> 01:40:25,864
Leeches.

1028
01:40:26,425 --> 01:40:27,858
Leeches.

1029
01:40:42,545 --> 01:40:46,458
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.

1030
01:40:46,825 --> 01:40:49,055
What's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

1031
01:40:49,305 --> 01:40:51,694
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

1032
01:40:51,945 --> 01:40:55,301
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.

1033
01:40:55,505 --> 01:40:56,904
What's wrong with that thing?

1034
01:40:57,145 --> 01:41:00,660
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.

1035
01:41:00,905 --> 01:41:05,820
I'll tell you. It's wet, mildewed!
Like everything else in this jungle.

1036
01:41:06,225 --> 01:41:07,863
You might as well dump it!

1037
01:41:12,745 --> 01:41:14,861
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1038
01:41:15,065 --> 01:41:19,377
This is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy...

1039
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:22,059
...and never volunteer for anything.

1040
01:41:34,705 --> 01:41:36,661
If we stay, we'll
be up to our necks.

1041
01:41:36,865 --> 01:41:39,060
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it!

1042
01:41:39,305 --> 01:41:42,980
Yes, sir. "One, original
bridge works reported abandoned.

1043
01:41:43,185 --> 01:41:45,699
New construction downstream
from first site.

1044
01:41:45,945 --> 01:41:49,858
Two, enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train...

1045
01:41:50,065 --> 01:41:52,898
...Bangkok for Rangoon
with troops and V.I.P.

1046
01:41:53,145 --> 01:41:55,659
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.

1047
01:41:55,865 --> 01:41:58,902
Three, synchronize demolition
with passage of train.

1048
01:41:59,145 --> 01:42:02,137
Four, good hunting. Have fun."
That's all.

1049
01:42:02,385 --> 01:42:04,103
A train and a bridge!

1050
01:42:04,345 --> 01:42:06,461
Can we get there in time, sir?

1051
01:42:06,665 --> 01:42:09,020
Yai says we're two to three days away.

1052
01:42:09,265 --> 01:42:13,178
If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 12th.

1053
01:42:13,425 --> 01:42:15,256
It's worth it for the train.

1054
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:18,656
Oh, by all means. Good hunting.
Good show.

1055
01:42:18,865 --> 01:42:20,776
Jolly good fun. Jolly good.

1056
01:42:21,865 --> 01:42:25,175
If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.

1057
01:42:25,425 --> 01:42:28,064
There's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

1058
01:42:52,185 --> 01:42:54,574
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.

1059
01:42:56,225 --> 01:42:58,785
Well, we'll complete this later.

1060
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:02,981
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?

1061
01:43:03,945 --> 01:43:07,824
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We can't finish the bridge on time.

1062
01:43:08,065 --> 01:43:09,578
We haven't the manpower.

1063
01:43:09,785 --> 01:43:12,982
I've asked the officers to help,
but that won't do it.

1064
01:43:13,225 --> 01:43:14,738
The officers are working?

1065
01:43:14,985 --> 01:43:18,580
I explained the situation and they
volunteered, but it's not enough.

1066
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:20,497
Why not ask Saito for some men?

1067
01:43:20,745 --> 01:43:23,623
This is ours. We'll make the most
of our resources.

1068
01:43:23,865 --> 01:43:26,618
That's why I came to talk to you.
The sick list.

1069
01:43:26,865 --> 01:43:30,494
There's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.

1070
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:35,216
It's no reflection on you, but
there are always a few malingerers.

1071
01:43:35,465 --> 01:43:37,774
Keep an open mind, that's all I ask.

1072
01:43:38,025 --> 01:43:39,777
Come along, let's see.

1073
01:43:41,185 --> 01:43:42,982
Don't move, don't move.

1074
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:48,183
What's wrong with Haskins?

1075
01:43:48,425 --> 01:43:51,895
Amoebic dysentery and black
water fever. Temperature of 104.

1076
01:43:52,145 --> 01:43:53,578
Right. I see.

1077
01:43:56,545 --> 01:43:57,694
And this man?

1078
01:43:57,945 --> 01:44:01,699
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save it
if I do more cutting tonight.

1079
01:44:01,945 --> 01:44:03,822
Want to send him out to work?

1080
01:44:04,065 --> 01:44:05,783
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

1081
01:44:10,065 --> 01:44:11,100
That man there?

1082
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:12,494
His arm's infected.

1083
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:14,975
Most of their wounds
won't heal properly.

1084
01:44:15,185 --> 01:44:19,895
I wonder if fresh air and light duties
might do more than being cooped up.

1085
01:44:20,145 --> 01:44:23,023
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...

1086
01:44:23,265 --> 01:44:26,905
...just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?

1087
01:44:27,145 --> 01:44:30,979
A man may not be on top of his form,
but he can still be useful.

1088
01:44:31,225 --> 01:44:34,695
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.

1089
01:44:34,945 --> 01:44:38,381
Do you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?

1090
01:44:39,945 --> 01:44:42,379
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.

1091
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:45,024
You? Nothing difficult.

1092
01:44:45,265 --> 01:44:47,574
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

1093
01:44:49,265 --> 01:44:53,816
Look here, men. It goes without
saying that I'm proud of all of you.

1094
01:44:54,065 --> 01:44:58,422
But we're facing a crisis. For those
of you who feel up to it...

1095
01:44:58,665 --> 01:45:02,578
...how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

1096
01:45:02,825 --> 01:45:04,178
What do you say?

1097
01:45:04,385 --> 01:45:07,855
- Yes, sir.
- Good show. Come on, follow me.

1098
01:46:46,225 --> 01:46:47,214
Ten minutes.

1099
01:48:40,425 --> 01:48:42,222
Make sure they're all dead.

1100
01:48:45,545 --> 01:48:46,864
Come on, Joyce.

1101
01:48:48,985 --> 01:48:51,499
Use your knife
or we'll be shooting each other.

1102
01:49:03,305 --> 01:49:04,897
Go that way, Joyce.

1103
01:51:08,065 --> 01:51:10,784
I could have done it.
I was ready.

1104
01:51:15,105 --> 01:51:16,424
Are you hit, sir?

1105
01:51:16,785 --> 01:51:18,013
Let's go.

1106
01:51:38,505 --> 01:51:42,054
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped
bone, but nothing broken.

1107
01:51:42,305 --> 01:51:44,341
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up.

1108
01:51:44,585 --> 01:51:46,974
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.

1109
01:51:47,185 --> 01:51:48,857
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

1110
01:51:49,065 --> 01:51:51,625
We won't know that
till I've tried it, will we?

1111
01:54:54,925 --> 01:54:56,517
What are you doing?

1112
01:54:56,965 --> 01:54:58,956
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1113
01:54:59,165 --> 01:55:00,564
We all need it.

1114
01:55:04,485 --> 01:55:07,875
We're still five hours' fast march
from the objective.

1115
01:55:08,085 --> 01:55:09,359
Maybe six.

1116
01:55:10,365 --> 01:55:11,480
Come on.

1117
01:55:11,685 --> 01:55:14,119
If you keep walking,
you'll bleed to death.

1118
01:55:21,405 --> 01:55:24,317
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.

1119
01:55:25,205 --> 01:55:27,719
You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.

1120
01:55:27,925 --> 01:55:29,961
You've got to get there
before sundown.

1121
01:55:30,165 --> 01:55:34,636
But, sir, when the job's done, who
knows if we can return by this route...

1122
01:55:34,885 --> 01:55:36,921
...or whether we could find you
if we did?

1123
01:55:37,165 --> 01:55:40,555
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate
to leave you and you know that.

1124
01:55:40,965 --> 01:55:42,159
He doesn't know, but I do.

1125
01:55:42,405 --> 01:55:45,715
You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.

1126
01:55:46,405 --> 01:55:49,715
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.

1127
01:55:49,925 --> 01:55:52,120
You're in command now, Shears.

1128
01:55:54,765 --> 01:55:56,517
I won't obey that order.

1129
01:55:57,085 --> 01:55:58,564
Your heroics make me sick.

1130
01:55:58,765 --> 01:56:01,438
You carry the stench of death
like the plague.

1131
01:56:01,685 --> 01:56:03,801
Explosives and L-pills
go well together.

1132
01:56:04,165 --> 01:56:07,475
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

1133
01:56:07,805 --> 01:56:09,443
This is just a game, this war.

1134
01:56:09,685 --> 01:56:13,439
You and that Colonel Nicholson.
You're crazy with courage. For what?

1135
01:56:13,685 --> 01:56:16,518
How to die like a gentleman,
how to die by the rules...

1136
01:56:16,725 --> 01:56:20,320
...when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being!

1137
01:56:24,165 --> 01:56:26,918
I'm not gonna leave you
here to die, Warden...

1138
01:56:28,205 --> 01:56:31,914
...because I don't care about
your bridge or about your rules.

1139
01:56:32,365 --> 01:56:34,925
If we go on, we go on together.

1140
01:56:37,725 --> 01:56:39,317
Good old Yai.

1141
01:56:50,805 --> 01:56:51,920
All right.

1142
01:57:02,165 --> 01:57:03,393
Come on.

1143
01:57:50,885 --> 01:57:52,284
Let's get closer.

1144
01:58:11,005 --> 01:58:13,121
Still sorry we brought you along?

1145
01:58:14,725 --> 01:58:16,556
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1146
01:58:16,765 --> 01:58:18,915
You're in command again, you know.

1147
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:20,717
Thank you, major.

1148
01:58:21,565 --> 01:58:26,355
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.

1149
01:58:28,965 --> 01:58:31,718
Not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together.

1150
01:58:32,045 --> 01:58:33,239
Look.

1151
01:58:35,005 --> 01:58:36,961
Those poor devils down there.

1152
01:58:37,205 --> 01:58:40,880
Imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in.

1153
01:58:41,965 --> 01:58:44,843
They've got a British officer
working on his knees.

1154
01:58:45,085 --> 01:58:47,076
The Japanese seem
to be enjoying it too.

1155
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,924
If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale.

1156
01:59:09,605 --> 01:59:12,845
If not for the train, we could
set a time fuse and be miles away.

1157
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:15,764
Since we don't know
what time it'll cross tomorrow...

1158
01:59:16,005 --> 01:59:18,125
...we'll have to do the job manually.

1159
01:59:18,765 --> 01:59:21,404
We'll set the charges
against the piles...

1160
01:59:21,645 --> 01:59:25,001
...about three feet underwater,
I should think...

1161
01:59:25,245 --> 01:59:28,442
...and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger.

1162
01:59:29,645 --> 01:59:32,364
The problem is where to hide it.

1163
01:59:37,325 --> 01:59:40,237
Our side of the river is
obviously used by the Japanese.

1164
01:59:40,565 --> 01:59:42,362
They'd spot it at once.

1165
01:59:46,045 --> 01:59:49,082
Look. Do you see
those fallen tree trunks?

1166
01:59:49,325 --> 01:59:52,476
And the grey rock just below them
on that little beach?

1167
01:59:53,045 --> 01:59:56,401
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.

1168
01:59:57,405 --> 01:59:58,918
The wrong side of the river...

1169
01:59:59,165 --> 02:00:02,601
...but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.

1170
02:00:04,005 --> 02:00:05,996
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1171
02:00:06,445 --> 02:00:09,198
...whoever's there
will have to swim back.

1172
02:00:09,405 --> 02:00:11,316
It won't be a pleasant swim.

1173
02:00:11,565 --> 02:00:13,999
Sir, I was the best swimmer
in my course.

1174
02:00:16,765 --> 02:00:19,040
It looks like
your line of country, then.

1175
02:00:19,245 --> 02:00:20,041
Thank you.

1176
02:00:20,245 --> 02:00:23,920
Shears, pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

1177
02:00:24,165 --> 02:00:26,963
Yai will be with you
so you can occupy the Nips...

1178
02:00:27,165 --> 02:00:29,235
...if they make trouble for Joyce.

1179
02:00:29,485 --> 02:00:31,840
On the theory that
there's always one more thing...

1180
02:00:32,085 --> 02:00:36,317
...I'll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversion.

1181
02:00:36,565 --> 02:00:39,796
Perhaps I might even take
a few potshots at the train.

1182
02:00:40,045 --> 02:00:41,239
All clear?

1183
02:00:41,485 --> 02:00:44,636
Any questions? Right, you'll
start as soon as it's dark.

1184
02:00:44,845 --> 02:00:47,564
They're sure to have
sentries on the bridge...

1185
02:00:47,765 --> 02:00:51,440
...so you'll have to float
the stuff down from upriver...

1186
02:00:51,685 --> 02:00:53,437
...which means building a raft.

1187
02:00:53,645 --> 02:00:54,634
Yai.

1188
02:00:59,445 --> 02:01:01,800
Yai will take three women to help you.

1189
02:01:02,045 --> 02:01:05,003
One will stay here with me.
All right, get cracking!

1190
02:01:10,045 --> 02:01:14,197
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd take Joyce's assignment.

1191
02:01:14,805 --> 02:01:16,602
You think he'll be all right?

1192
02:01:16,885 --> 02:01:19,194
I think so. Want me to handle it?

1193
02:01:19,765 --> 02:01:22,598
I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if I could.

1194
02:01:23,205 --> 02:01:24,399
I'm sorry.

1195
02:01:25,085 --> 02:01:27,519
When it's over, I hope
you get that medical discharge...

1196
02:01:27,725 --> 02:01:29,602
...and not the hard way.

1197
02:01:29,805 --> 02:01:30,999
Thanks.

1198
02:02:07,605 --> 02:02:08,594
Load.

1199
02:03:11,725 --> 02:03:12,953
Beautiful.

1200
02:03:13,685 --> 02:03:15,277
Yes, beautiful.

1201
02:03:15,565 --> 02:03:17,283
A first-rate job.

1202
02:03:17,725 --> 02:03:20,080
I had no idea it would
turn out so well.

1203
02:03:25,245 --> 02:03:27,475
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1204
02:03:28,645 --> 02:03:30,078
I've been thinking...

1205
02:03:31,045 --> 02:03:35,482
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that I've been in the service.

1206
02:03:35,765 --> 02:03:38,279
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

1207
02:03:39,525 --> 02:03:43,074
I haven't been at home more
than ten months in all that time.

1208
02:03:43,645 --> 02:03:45,875
Still, it's been a good life.

1209
02:03:47,165 --> 02:03:49,201
I love India.

1210
02:03:50,725 --> 02:03:52,875
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1211
02:03:54,485 --> 02:03:56,123
But there are times...

1212
02:03:57,725 --> 02:04:01,877
Suddenly you realize you are
nearer the end than the beginning.

1213
02:04:02,845 --> 02:04:04,324
And you wonder...

1214
02:04:05,925 --> 02:04:07,881
You ask yourself...

1215
02:04:09,165 --> 02:04:12,282
...what the sum total
of your life represents...

1216
02:04:13,045 --> 02:04:16,481
...what difference your being there
at any time made to anything...

1217
02:04:16,965 --> 02:04:19,479
...or if it made any difference
at all, really.

1218
02:04:21,045 --> 02:04:24,276
Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.

1219
02:04:24,925 --> 02:04:27,314
I don't know if that
kind of thinking's healthy...

1220
02:04:27,885 --> 02:04:31,514
...but I must admit I've had
some thoughts on those lines...

1221
02:04:31,765 --> 02:04:33,676
...from time to time.

1222
02:04:36,645 --> 02:04:38,283
But tonight...

1223
02:04:39,685 --> 02:04:40,674
Tonight...

1224
02:04:44,285 --> 02:04:45,684
Blast.

1225
02:04:52,325 --> 02:04:53,724
I must be off.

1226
02:04:56,445 --> 02:04:59,676
The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.

1227
02:05:44,645 --> 02:05:45,873
Lovely.

1228
02:07:49,525 --> 02:07:52,676
If you were the only

1229
02:07:52,885 --> 02:07:55,524
Girl in the world

1230
02:07:55,725 --> 02:08:00,640
And you were the only boy

1231
02:08:01,045 --> 02:08:03,320
Nothing else would matter

1232
02:08:03,525 --> 02:08:06,483
In the world today

1233
02:08:06,965 --> 02:08:08,921
We could go on loving

1234
02:08:09,125 --> 02:08:12,197
In the same old way

1235
02:08:12,765 --> 02:08:17,680
A Garden of Eden just made for two

1236
02:12:40,365 --> 02:12:42,117
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

1237
02:12:42,325 --> 02:12:45,283
...when I say this has been
a most enjoyable evening.

1238
02:12:46,965 --> 02:12:51,880
Most of you move on tomorrow
to a new camp and new construction.

1239
02:12:52,325 --> 02:12:56,477
It's a pity you won't see the first
practical use of this bridge.

1240
02:12:56,725 --> 02:12:59,285
You'll be glad to know
that the completion...

1241
02:12:59,525 --> 02:13:01,641
...of this link in the railway...

1242
02:13:01,845 --> 02:13:05,076
...will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled...

1243
02:13:05,325 --> 02:13:08,283
...to the new camp by train.

1244
02:13:09,845 --> 02:13:12,678
Colonel Saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind...

1245
02:13:12,885 --> 02:13:15,115
...with Major Clipton
and the sick men...

1246
02:13:15,365 --> 02:13:18,721
...and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.

1247
02:13:20,685 --> 02:13:23,685
Now that your work here is finished...

1248
02:13:23,925 --> 02:13:27,804
...I suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.

1249
02:13:28,565 --> 02:13:30,476
That's quite understandable.

1250
02:13:30,765 --> 02:13:33,279
It's a very natural reaction.

1251
02:13:35,565 --> 02:13:38,682
But one day, in a week,
a month, a year...

1252
02:13:38,885 --> 02:13:42,560
...on that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again...

1253
02:13:43,245 --> 02:13:48,160
...you're going to feel very proud
of what you've achieved here...

1254
02:13:48,485 --> 02:13:51,079
...in the face of great adversity.

1255
02:13:52,245 --> 02:13:54,281
What you have done should be...

1256
02:13:55,125 --> 02:13:56,877
...and I think will be...

1257
02:13:57,245 --> 02:14:01,682
...an example to all our countrymen,
soldier and civilian alike.

1258
02:14:02,845 --> 02:14:05,279
You have survived with honor.

1259
02:14:06,165 --> 02:14:07,883
That, and more.

1260
02:14:09,445 --> 02:14:11,481
Here in the wilderness...

1261
02:14:11,765 --> 02:14:15,075
...you have turned defeat
into victory.

1262
02:14:17,725 --> 02:14:19,681
I congratulate you.

1263
02:14:20,205 --> 02:14:21,194
Well done.

1264
02:14:26,365 --> 02:14:27,593
To the king.

1265
02:17:03,325 --> 02:17:04,724
You're in business.

1266
02:17:04,925 --> 02:17:08,884
Now, you got everything? Stem,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

1267
02:17:10,485 --> 02:17:12,680
I'll be directly across the river.

1268
02:17:14,085 --> 02:17:16,883
The professor says there's
always one more thing to do.

1269
02:17:17,565 --> 02:17:19,681
I can't think of what it could be.

1270
02:17:21,045 --> 02:17:23,479
Except to wish you
a long and happy life.

1271
02:17:23,885 --> 02:17:24,920
Thank you.

1272
02:19:35,085 --> 02:19:36,484
What's happened?

1273
02:19:41,445 --> 02:19:43,117
The river's gone down.

1274
02:20:04,445 --> 02:20:06,276
You can see the wire.

1275
02:20:07,085 --> 02:20:08,313
The charges!

1276
02:22:11,365 --> 02:22:13,674
Don't wait for the train.

1277
02:22:13,965 --> 02:22:15,000
Do it now!

1278
02:22:41,445 --> 02:22:45,120
If Saito is correct, the train
will arrive in 5 or 10 minutes.

1279
02:22:45,365 --> 02:22:48,004
If you don't mind,
I'll watch from up on the hill.

1280
02:22:48,245 --> 02:22:50,076
Why? It's better from the bridge.

1281
02:22:50,325 --> 02:22:53,681
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.

1282
02:22:53,925 --> 02:22:58,077
As you please. Honestly, sometimes
I don't understand you at all.

1283
02:22:58,325 --> 02:23:02,477
As you once said, sir, I've got
a lot to learn about the army.

1284
02:23:09,165 --> 02:23:10,484
Good morning.

1285
02:23:10,725 --> 02:23:12,875
River's gone down in the night.

1286
02:24:53,325 --> 02:24:54,440
What's he doing?

1287
02:25:39,325 --> 02:25:42,317
Colonel, there's something
rather odd going on.

1288
02:25:42,565 --> 02:25:46,080
I think we better have a look around
before that train comes across.

1289
02:26:42,525 --> 02:26:43,878
He's gone mad.

1290
02:26:44,085 --> 02:26:46,076
He's leading him right to it!

1291
02:26:46,325 --> 02:26:47,678
Our own man!

1292
02:27:30,085 --> 02:27:32,883
I was right. There is
something going on.

1293
02:28:25,765 --> 02:28:28,962
You've got to do it, boy!
You've got to do it now!

1294
02:28:31,685 --> 02:28:35,473
Have you a knife? I just realized
the bridge has been mined!

1295
02:28:35,685 --> 02:28:37,045
Mined!

1296
02:28:43,685 --> 02:28:44,720
Good boy!

1297
02:28:49,485 --> 02:28:52,124
British officer!
Here to blow up the bridge.

1298
02:28:52,365 --> 02:28:56,324
- Blow up the bridge!
- Yes, sir. British commando orders.

1299
02:28:56,565 --> 02:28:59,079
- Blow up the bridge?!
- Yes. There's no time!

1300
02:28:59,285 --> 02:29:01,640
No, no! Help!

1301
02:29:08,605 --> 02:29:10,800
Kill him! Kill him!

1302
02:29:11,165 --> 02:29:13,520
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand!

1303
02:29:14,525 --> 02:29:17,278
Kill him! Kill him!

1304
02:29:27,165 --> 02:29:28,883
Kill him, Joyce!

1305
02:30:20,165 --> 02:30:21,154
You!

1306
02:30:22,125 --> 02:30:23,717
You!

1307
02:30:37,045 --> 02:30:38,717
What have I done?

1308
02:31:44,605 --> 02:31:46,084
Madness!

1309
02:31:58,125 --> 02:31:59,877
I had to do it!

1310
02:32:00,765 --> 02:32:03,882
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive!

1311
02:32:04,365 --> 02:32:06,276
It was the only thing to do!

1312
02:32:41,085 --> 02:32:42,484
Madness!

1313
02:32:45,165 --> 02:32:46,314
Madness!

1314
02:35:11,525 --> 02:35:12,514
