2
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:30,076
Finish work. Hurry!
Go to hut.

3
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:32,206
Yeah, that figures.

4
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:36,048
Those new prisoners see us digging
graves, they might all run away.

5
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:41,682
No time for jokes.
Finish work. Dig!

6
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:44,989
How about putting us
on the sick list?

7
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:47,758
Have a heart, Captain.
Put us in the hospital.

8
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,492
You no sick.

9
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,329
You never sick.

10
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,097
Why you always play sick, Shears?

11
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:56,833
Don't want one of these
over my head.

12
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:02,602
Captain Kanematsu,
how about a butt?

13
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,443
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

14
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:09,178
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favor.

15
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:11,517
When a man gives me something
from the goodness of his heart...

16
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:16,184
like you gave me that this morning,
I remember it from the heart.

17
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:22,193
That's why I want you
to keep this lighter.

18
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,167
Think I stole it?

19
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,173
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried over there.

20
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,176
He willed that lighter to me
for a favor I done him.

21
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:37,441
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

22
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,108
You funny man, Shears.

23
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:45,553
You go on the sick list.
Him too.

24
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:50,656
One day, Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him.

25
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,160
Then what?

26
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:58,032
Before that happens,
we'll be far away from here, chum.

27
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:03,170
Let's knock off.

28
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,909
Here lies--

29
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:11,746
- Weaver, I've forgotten who we buried.
- Thomson.

30
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:13,476
Ah, yes.

31
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,484
Here lies Corporal Herbert Thomson...

32
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:19,545
serial number 01 234567...

33
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:22,183
valiant member
of the King's own...

34
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,727
or the Queen's own
or something...

35
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:29,425
who died of beriberi
in the year of our Lord 1 943...

36
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:32,093
for the greater glory of--

37
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:35,771
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.

38
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,501
No need to mock the grave.

39
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:42,375
I don't mock the grave or the men.

40
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:44,607
May he rest in peace.

41
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:50,153
He found little enough of it
while he was alive.

42
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,958
Battalion, halt.

43
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,330
End of the line.

44
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,336
Left turn!

45
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:30,268
Stand at ease.

46
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,773
Stand easy.

47
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,351
We're going to be a busy pair
of gravediggers.

48
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,353
Well done.

49
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:57,096
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

50
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:00,159
- You going to tell him the truth?
- Of course not.

51
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:02,761
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

52
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,934
My name is Nicholson.

53
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,568
I am Colonel Saito.

54
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:57,756
In the name
of His Imperial Majesty...

55
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:59,954
I welcome you.

56
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,057
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

57
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:07,433
which is Camp 1 6...

58
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:09,995
along the great railroad...

59
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:15,534
which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

60
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,946
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

61
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:24,248
to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

62
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,280
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill...

63
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:34,490
and officers will work
as well as men.

64
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:40,264
TheJapanese Army
cannot have idle mouths to feed.

65
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:45,330
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

66
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:49,139
But if you do not work hard...

67
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:52,181
you will be punished!

68
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,276
A word to you about escape.

69
00:12:57,353 --> 00:13:00,550
There is no barbed wire...

70
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,818
no stockade...

71
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,484
no watchtower.

72
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:08,053
They are not necessary.

73
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,964
We are an island in the jungle.

74
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:14,401
Escape is impossible.

75
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:17,099
You would die.

76
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,910
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you will begin.

77
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:29,213
Let me remind you
of General Yamashita's motto:

78
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:33,187
Be happy in your work.

79
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,992
Dismissed!

80
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:46,226
Battalion, stand at ease!

81
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,031
Fall out, Major Hughes.

82
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,538
Hughes, get the men to their quarters.
Tell Clipton to see to the sick.

83
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,170
- I'll have a word with this fellow.
- Very good.

84
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:04,684
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

85
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:08,383
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of the British soldier.

86
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,985
Naturally, my officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

87
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:16,395
You may have overlooked that the use
of officers for manual labor...

88
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,934
is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

89
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,435
Is that so?

90
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,437
I have a copy
of the Convention with me...

91
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:25,474
and would be glad to let you
glance through it if you wish.

92
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,238
That will not be necessary.

93
00:15:07,016 --> 00:15:08,483
Attention.

94
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:14,114
Sit down, please.

95
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:24,829
Yes, sir.

96
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,311
- I'll speak to Clipton. See you later.
- Very good, sir.

97
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,679
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

98
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,513
- How's the arm,Jennings?
- Nearly healed, sir.

99
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:18,850
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

100
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,719
- Good heavens.
- How do you do, sir?

101
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,724
We found him and an Australian
in the hospital here.

102
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,022
They're all that's left
of the prisoners who built the camp.

103
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:26,857
The U.S. Navy out here?

104
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,194
For a deepwater sailor,
I am sort of landlocked.

105
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,495
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.

106
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:35,367
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

107
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:37,030
And your group here?

108
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:40,166
Mostly Aussies, some Lime--
some British...

109
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:41,870
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

110
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,674
What happened to them?

111
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:46,010
They died...

112
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:49,711
of malaria, dysentery,
beriberi, gangrene.

113
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,946
Other causes of death:
famine, overwork...

114
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:56,890
bullet wounds, snake bites...

115
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,053
Saito...

116
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:02,154
and then there were some
who just got tired of living.

117
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,698
Has Clipton looked at you?

118
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:07,759
Just about to, sir. Commander,
you can finish that shave later.

119
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:09,270
All right.

120
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:15,900
You'll stay with the officers,
and we'll find some decent clothing.

121
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,674
Don't bother about me, Colonel.

122
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,113
I'm not anxious
to get off the sick list.

123
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:23,084
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.

124
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,552
The officers in your party
did manual labor?

125
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:27,714
You could call it that.

126
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,918
Actually, I raised that very point
with Colonel-- What's his name?

127
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,820
I think he understands
the situation now.

128
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:38,856
- Is that so?
- Yes. He's seems a reasonable type.

129
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:41,130
I must be pushing on.

130
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:44,640
There's an officers' meeting at 7:00.
Get me a list of your requirements.

131
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:46,868
Yes, sir.

132
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:50,106
- Anything we can do.
- Thank you, sir.

133
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:55,040
- What is it?
- Never mind.

134
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:56,915
Go on, say it.

135
00:17:56,986 --> 00:18:01,753
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito, but ''reasonable''?

136
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:03,792
That's a new one.

137
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,761
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson
defines the word differently.

138
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,298
Any other points?

139
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,068
- By your leave, sir.
- Yes,Jennings?

140
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:22,236
About the escape committee, sir.
I've talked with Commander Shears--

141
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,472
There won't be any escape committee.

142
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,015
I don't understand, sir.
LieutenantJennings has a plan.

143
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:31,486
Yes, I'm sureJennings has a plan,
but escape? Where?

144
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:33,317
Into this jungle?

145
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:36,381
Saito was right.
No need for barbed wire here.

146
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:39,553
One chance in a hundred
of survival.

147
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:43,497
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

148
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:47,468
I'd say the odds against a successful
escape are a hundred to one.

149
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,528
- Right.
- But may I add another word?

150
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,038
Please.

151
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:54,201
The odds against survival
in this camp are even worse.

152
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:57,508
You've seen the graveyard.
There are your real odds.

153
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,276
To give up hope of escape,
to even stop thinking about it...

154
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,681
is like accepting a death sentence.

155
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:05,619
Why haven't you tried
to escape, Commander?

156
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:09,681
I've been biding my time, waiting
for the right moment, the right company.

157
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,319
I understand how you feel.

158
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:15,694
Of course, it's normally the duty
of a captured soldier...

159
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,198
to attempt escape...

160
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:20,201
but my men and I are involved
in a curious legal point...

161
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,669
of which you are unaware.

162
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:26,538
In Singapore, we were ordered
to surrender by Command Headquarters.

163
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,600
''Ordered.''

164
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:32,478
Therefore, in our case, escape
might be an infraction of military law.

165
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,015
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,519
- Interesting point.
- I didn't quite follow you.

167
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:41,387
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

168
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:44,324
Without law, Commander,
there is no civilization.

169
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,920
That's just my point:
Here there is no civilization.

170
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:51,023
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

171
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,126
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

172
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,065
Is there anything else?

173
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:02,873
I think we're all clear
on the program.

174
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:06,745
I want everything to go off without
a hitch starting tomorrow morning.

175
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,613
Remember this:

176
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:11,847
Our men must always feel
they are still commanded by us...

177
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,048
and not by theJapanese.

178
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:18,457
If they have that idea to cling to,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

179
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:20,120
Are you with me, Commander?

180
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:28,531
I hope they can remain soldiers,
Colonel.

181
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:32,472
As for me, I'm just a slave,
a living slave.

182
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:49,019
Queer bird,
even for an American.

183
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:52,117
He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.

184
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,493
Cut off from his unit.

185
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:56,293
It should be a lesson
to all of us.

186
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:04,131
Attention!

187
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,512
English prisoners!

188
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:19,577
Notice I do not say,
'' English soldiers.''

189
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,352
From the moment you surrendered...

190
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:25,690
you ceased to be soldiers.

191
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:29,128
You will finish the bridge...

192
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:32,224
by the 1 2th day of May.

193
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:36,795
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer...

194
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:38,863
Lieutenant Mioura.

195
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:42,977
Time is short.

196
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:44,706
All men will work!

197
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,977
Your officers will work beside you.

198
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,984
This is only just...

199
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:54,113
for it is they who betrayed you
by surrender.

200
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,057
Your shame is their dishonor.

201
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,856
It is they who told you...

202
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:04,662
'' Better to live like a coolie
than die like a hero.''

203
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:08,170
It is they who brought you here,
not I!

204
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:09,932
Therefore...

205
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:14,340
they will join you
in useful labor.

206
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,173
That is all.

207
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:20,477
Officer prisoners,
collect your tools.

208
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,017
Bradley, back in your place.

209
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:31,516
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

210
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:35,360
to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

211
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:37,729
'' Belligerents
may employ as workmen...

212
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,963
prisoners of war who are physically fit
other than officers--''

213
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:43,369
- Give me the book.
- By all means.

214
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,134
You read English, I take it?

215
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:47,573
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.

216
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:51,044
If it's a matter of precise translation,
I'm sure that can be arranged.

217
00:22:51,113 --> 00:22:53,138
The code specifically states
that the--

218
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:57,420
Stand fast in the ranks!

219
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,909
Stand fast in the ranks!

220
00:22:57,987 --> 00:23:00,512
You speak to me of code?

221
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:04,683
What code?
The coward's code!

222
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,990
What do you know
of the soldier's code, of Bushido?

223
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:14,935
Nothing!
You are unworthy of command!

224
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:31,516
Since you refuse to abide
by the laws of the civilized world...

225
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:35,455
we must consider ourselves absolved
from our duty to obey you.

226
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:38,982
My officers
will not do manual labor.

227
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:40,995
We shall see.

228
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:47,462
All enlisted prisoners to work!

229
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:01,010
Sergeant Major,
take the men to work.

230
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:05,713
Yes, sir.
Battalion, take up tools.

231
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,067
What's he up to?

232
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,580
Looks like he doesn't want
any witnesses.

233
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:26,299
Now you will be reasonable.

234
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,065
You will order
your officers to work.

235
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,630
I will count three.

236
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:07,073
If by the third count...

237
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:11,602
you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

238
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,581
I will give the order to fire.

239
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:26,586
He's going to do it.

240
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:29,222
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

241
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,274
One.

242
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:42,640
I warn you, Colonel.

243
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,645
Two.

244
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,650
Stop!

245
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:56,653
I've seen and heard everything.

246
00:26:56,725 --> 00:27:00,286
So has every man in the hospital.
There are too many witnesses.

247
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,296
You'll never get away
with calling it a mass escape.

248
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,161
- Most of those men can't walk.
- Shut up!

249
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:10,938
Is this your soldier's code,
murdering unarmed men?

250
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:27,314
You see, there are certain advantages
to being on the sick list.

251
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:30,375
I'll say this for the old man:
He's got guts.

252
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:32,920
Into the valley of death
rode the 600.

253
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:36,685
- How's that, sir?
- That kind of guts.

254
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,853
Also the kind they had in 1 91 4,
when your officers went over the top...

255
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,589
with nothing but a swagger stick.

256
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:45,259
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all!

257
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,996
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

258
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:32,308
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to go along too.

259
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:37,210
Arm's almost healed, sir.
Really it is.

260
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:39,652
What about him?

261
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:42,816
He didn't actually order us
not to escape. He only suggested--

262
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:47,658
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

263
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:50,531
Here we go again.

264
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:04,509
Colonel Saito say,
all officers to punishment hut.

265
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,172
Tell them to go.

266
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,887
Not you.

267
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:31,104
Come.

268
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:55,086
Leave him alone!

269
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:49,284
They're putting him in the oven.

270
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,151
They're putting him in the oven.

271
00:32:13,175 --> 00:32:16,872
For he's a jolly good fellow

272
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,643
As so say all of us

273
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,837
Hurray!

274
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:52,826
Timber!

275
00:34:57,906 --> 00:35:01,171
- One, two, three, pull!
- Hurry!

276
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,853
Let go!

277
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:05,535
You wish to see me?

278
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:07,905
I've been trying to see you
for three days.

279
00:36:07,976 --> 00:36:11,207
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut--

280
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,475
I could have you shot.

281
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:21,250
Those prisoners who tried to escape
were in your charge.

282
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:23,348
I knew nothing about the escape.

283
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:26,087
It does not matter.

284
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:29,255
One must even respect
those who tried.

285
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:33,233
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

286
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:35,235
they were soldiers again.

287
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,433
But it is insane
to try and escape.

288
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:43,000
Two soldiers shot...

289
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,046
the third drowned!

290
00:36:45,113 --> 00:36:46,705
To what end?

291
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:50,217
It was an escape from reality.

292
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,725
Here is reality.

293
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:05,061
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today...

294
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:08,830
and this shows the position
of actual progress.

295
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:13,368
Because of your colonel's
stubbornness...

296
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,773
we are far behind the schedule!

297
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:20,577
That is not all.
Enlisted prisoners sabotage the work.

298
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:22,640
Yes, I have seen it.

299
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:24,742
I could have them all shot.

300
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:27,481
Then who would build your bridge?

301
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:29,854
Besides,
are you sure it's sabotage?

302
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:33,088
Perhaps the men don't work well without
their own officers to direct them.

303
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:35,789
My officers will direct them.

304
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:38,128
Your officers will work beside them.

305
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,395
That's for Colonel Nicholson
to decide.

306
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:42,299
As he pointed out,
it's against the rules.

307
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,702
Do not speak to me of rules!

308
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:46,832
This is war!

309
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:48,967
This is not a game of cricket.

310
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:55,812
Your colonel is mad.

311
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:58,318
Quite mad.

312
00:38:01,423 --> 00:38:03,357
Sit down, please.

313
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:12,428
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

314
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,092
Thank you.

315
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:18,731
Tell him that
if his officers will not work...

316
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:22,038
I'll be forced
to close the hospital...

317
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,671
and your patients will work
in their place.

318
00:38:25,747 --> 00:38:30,275
Many will die,
and he will be responsible.

319
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:34,516
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

320
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:06,609
The doc's going to see the old man.

321
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:11,758
Sir?

322
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,723
It's Clipton, sir.

323
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:21,526
I brought you a few things.

324
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:29,276
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir.

325
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:33,303
We scraped together
a little meat and a coconut.

326
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,648
And the officers?

327
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,587
They're not so good.
They're still in detention.

328
00:39:41,656 --> 00:39:45,251
And LieutenantJennings is dead.

329
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:48,758
- What?
- Killed attempting to escape.

330
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,596
Two others were with him:
Corporal Weaver and the American.

331
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,127
Poor, brave lad.

332
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:59,639
I warned him, didn't I?

333
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:03,041
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

334
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:09,411
I'd like to clean you up
while I talk.

335
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:11,884
I've got something to tell you.

336
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:14,547
I've had a word with Saito.

337
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:18,558
That man's the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

338
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:22,494
Actually, I think he's mad.
Carry on.

339
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,315
- Blackmail.
- I know, sir, but he means it.

340
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:47,822
It's a question of face,
pure and simple.

341
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:51,256
- He can't give in.
- It's still blackmail.

342
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:58,531
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

343
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,731
And wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

344
00:41:04,973 --> 00:41:08,875
The men are going
as slow on it as they dare...

345
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:12,242
but Saito's cut their food rations.

346
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:17,478
If he makes the sick men work,
they're going to die.

347
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:21,784
- That's all there is to it.
- Yes, I truly understand...

348
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,552
but it's a matter of principle.

349
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:28,562
If we give in now,
there will be no end to it.

350
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:36,103
Sir, we're lost in the jungle
a thousand miles from anywhere.

351
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:39,868
We're under the heel of a man
who will stop at nothing to get his way.

352
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:45,846
'' Principle''? No one will ever know
or care what happens to us.

353
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:49,816
- Give in, sir, please.
- I'm adamant.

354
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:53,820
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

355
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,549
- Time.
- All right.

356
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,657
Please thank those concerned.

357
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:04,630
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

358
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:06,496
Reynolds stole the coconut.

359
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:10,900
We'll be able to get you
a little something from time to time.

360
00:42:10,972 --> 00:42:13,463
We've bribed one of your guards.

361
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:23,415
Good-bye, sir,
and good luck.

362
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:24,918
Many thanks.

363
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:35,595
Did you say
that American chap was killed?

364
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:37,790
Yes, sir.
Shot and drowned.

365
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:43,267
It's insane to plan escapes.

366
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:47,741
Three men killed,
and to what end?

367
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:51,472
Here is where
we must win through.

368
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:15,901
The doc just looked at us
and shook his head. What does that mean?

369
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,531
It means only one thing:
The colonel won't give in.

370
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:38,484
It's like this: Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

371
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,960
It's a question of principle.

372
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:44,658
As medical officer, I must protest
at the way he's being treated.

373
00:43:44,732 --> 00:43:46,757
It's a wonder he's still alive.

374
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:50,793
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

375
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:57,244
He is responsible, not I.

376
00:44:08,423 --> 00:44:09,856
You sick?

377
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:15,354
Are they both mad?

378
00:44:17,098 --> 00:44:19,794
Or am I going mad?

379
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:22,669
Or is it the sun?

380
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:26,782
Attention!

381
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:31,220
Battalion, attention!

382
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:35,955
English prisoners...

383
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,396
let us ask the question...

384
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:41,902
''Why does the bridge
not progress?''

385
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:47,771
You know why.
Because your officers are lazy!

386
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:52,245
They think themselves too good
to share your burdens.

387
00:47:53,314 --> 00:47:54,838
This is not just.

388
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:58,181
Therefore,
you are not happy in your work.

389
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:02,416
Therefore,
the bridge does not progress.

390
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,254
But there is another cause.

391
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:08,762
I do not hide the truth.

392
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,628
With deep shame and regret...

393
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:17,262
I admit to you the failure
of a member of theJapanese staff.

394
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:19,704
I refer to Lieutenant Mioura.

395
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,436
He is a bad engineer.

396
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,910
He is unworthy of command.

397
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:29,882
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

398
00:48:31,686 --> 00:48:35,622
Tomorrow we begin again.

399
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,592
I shall be in personal command.

400
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,958
Today we rest.

401
00:48:43,764 --> 00:48:48,861
All work and no play
makeJack a dull boy.

402
00:48:48,936 --> 00:48:52,497
As a token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

403
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:55,303
I give presents to you all.

404
00:49:07,388 --> 00:49:10,721
Let us be happy in our work.

405
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,726
Company, dismiss.

406
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:18,161
Battalion, dismissed.

407
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,314
Take a look at this!

408
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:37,681
Red Cross?

409
00:49:37,752 --> 00:49:41,518
He's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

410
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:44,786
Tomorrow we begin again.

411
00:50:49,824 --> 00:50:54,261
Harry, look.
They're letting the old man out.

412
00:51:16,984 --> 00:51:20,579
Most likely going to give him
another pasting.

413
00:52:04,231 --> 00:52:05,994
Good evening, Colonel.

414
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:15,469
Do you mind sitting over here?

415
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:18,341
I am having rather
a late supper.

416
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:44,763
English corned beef.

417
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:46,864
No, thank you.

418
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:54,740
Produce of Scotland.

419
00:52:56,283 --> 00:52:58,843
I prefer it to saki.

420
00:52:58,919 --> 00:52:59,053
I spent three years in London.

421
00:52:59,053 --> 00:53:01,715
I spent three years in London.

422
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:06,817
I studied
at the London Polytechnic.

423
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:10,261
- Cheers.
- Sorry.

424
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:13,300
- Later, perhaps.
- Perhaps.

425
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,365
I was not a good artist.

426
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:24,877
My father disapproved.

427
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:27,505
He felt I belonged in the army...

428
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:32,280
so I changed
from art to engineering.

429
00:53:32,353 --> 00:53:37,222
I must tell you, Colonel Saito...

430
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:41,125
I intend to make a full report
of your activities in this camp.

431
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:50,429
I do not think
you quite realize my position.

432
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:53,871
- I must carry out my orders.
- Quite.

433
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:58,275
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 1 2th day of May.

434
00:53:58,345 --> 00:54:01,246
- Time is short. I only have 1 2 weeks.
- No doubt.

435
00:54:01,315 --> 00:54:06,048
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

436
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,248
But no officers, except
in an administrative capacity.

437
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:13,316
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

438
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:15,726
You know it! I know it!

439
00:54:15,796 --> 00:54:18,526
I'm not responsible for the actions
of other commanding officers.

440
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,294
Personally, I'm appalled.

441
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:22,597
Let's not get excited.

442
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:32,074
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you.

443
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:37,744
When I said all officers must work...

444
00:54:37,818 --> 00:54:41,413
naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

445
00:54:41,488 --> 00:54:45,948
My orders were only intended
for officers below--

446
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:48,290
None of my officers
will do manual labor.

447
00:54:48,362 --> 00:54:49,954
Please.

448
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:54,057
I was about to say, I have been
thinking the matter over...

449
00:54:54,134 --> 00:55:00,039
and decided to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

450
00:55:00,107 --> 00:55:03,076
leaving only the junior officers
to lend a hand.

451
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:06,840
I'm afraid not.
The Convention's clear on that point.

452
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,154
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

453
00:55:25,232 --> 00:55:27,166
I haven't the foggiest.

454
00:55:27,234 --> 00:55:30,067
I'll have to kill myself.

455
00:55:30,137 --> 00:55:33,334
What would you do if you are me?

456
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:36,570
I suppose if I were you...

457
00:55:36,644 --> 00:55:39,408
I'd have to kill myself.

458
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:42,414
Cheers.

459
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:46,414
I warn you, Colonel.

460
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:50,947
If I am to die,
others will die before me.

461
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:52,617
Do you understand that?

462
00:55:52,693 --> 00:55:55,184
Major Clipton did mention
something to that effect.

463
00:55:55,262 --> 00:55:57,890
That won't solve your problem.

464
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:00,763
I'm sure we can arrive
at a proper solution.

465
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,267
Please sit down.

466
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,536
Now, tell me, Colonel...

467
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:13,478
do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

468
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:15,606
- Of course.
- Good.

469
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:23,946
Take this bridge of yours.

470
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:26,720
It's quite
an enormous undertaking.

471
00:56:26,794 --> 00:56:30,127
I have grave doubts
whether your lieutenant--

472
00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:33,633
- What's his name?
- Mioura.

473
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:38,638
Is he capable of tackling a job
of such importance?

474
00:56:38,706 --> 00:56:43,666
On the other hand,
my officers Reeves and Hughes...

475
00:56:43,744 --> 00:56:47,111
have built bridges
all over India.

476
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:50,280
The men respect them.

477
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:53,946
It's essential for an officer
to have that respect.

478
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:59,015
If he loses it, he ceases to command.
Then there's demoralization and chaos.

479
00:56:59,093 --> 00:57:02,961
I would be a poor commander
if I allowed that to happen to my men.

480
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,964
Perhaps you are not aware...

481
00:57:05,032 --> 00:57:08,468
that the bridge is now
under my personal command.

482
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:12,335
Really?
Are you satisfied with the work?

483
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:14,840
- I am not!
- You prove my point.

484
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:17,342
I hate the British!

485
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:20,676
You are defeated,
but you have no shame.

486
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:23,410
You are stubborn,
but have no pride.

487
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:26,351
You endure,
but you have no courage.

488
00:57:29,923 --> 00:57:33,017
- It's pointless going on like this.
- Stay there!

489
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:10,799
Stand down!

490
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:24,386
Battalion, attention!

491
01:02:04,297 --> 01:02:07,130
Battalion, stand at ease!

492
01:02:09,336 --> 01:02:10,769
Please.

493
01:02:12,339 --> 01:02:17,436
- Do you know the date today?
- I'm afraid I've lost count.

494
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:23,313
It's the anniversary of our great
victory over Russia in 1 905.

495
01:02:23,383 --> 01:02:27,649
Throughout East Asia,
we are celebrating this date.

496
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,746
In honor of this occasion...

497
01:02:29,823 --> 01:02:33,088
I have given your troops
a day of rest.

498
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,529
- Many thanks.
- I am declaring a general amnesty.

499
01:02:37,597 --> 01:02:41,158
You and your officers
may return to your quarters.

500
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:43,794
As part of this amnesty...

501
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:49,399
it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labor.

502
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:20,667
He's done it.

503
01:05:43,516 --> 01:05:45,950
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

504
01:05:57,364 --> 01:05:59,298
How many men in your party,
Corporal?

505
01:05:59,366 --> 01:06:02,927
- I don't really know, sir.
- You don't know?

506
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:07,838
Twelve usually, but one of the men
took sick suddenly this morning...

507
01:06:07,908 --> 01:06:11,344
and it took three or four others
to help him to the hospital, sir.

508
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:16,674
He took terrible sick, sir.

509
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,652
A corporal should always know
exactly how many men he has under him.

510
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,689
Yes, sir.

511
01:06:23,757 --> 01:06:27,056
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces.

512
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:31,689
It may be funny, and I'm sure
it's done with the best motives...

513
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:33,699
but it's not military behavior.

514
01:06:33,767 --> 01:06:35,200
No, sir.

515
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:40,771
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

516
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,273
Yes, sir.

517
01:06:51,451 --> 01:06:53,851
- Reeves.
- Yes, sir?

518
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,583
Have you ever constructed a bridge
across a stream like the Kwai?

519
01:06:57,657 --> 01:07:01,423
Yes, sir. Half a dozen of them
in Madras, Bengal.

520
01:07:01,494 --> 01:07:06,363
If this were your bridge,
how would you get it underway?

521
01:07:08,468 --> 01:07:10,368
Get it underway, sir?

522
01:07:10,437 --> 01:07:14,396
First of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

523
01:07:14,474 --> 01:07:17,568
- Why not?
- As I was trying to tell you, sir...

524
01:07:17,644 --> 01:07:19,942
theJapanese couldn't have
picked a worse location.

525
01:07:20,013 --> 01:07:22,038
There's no bottom.

526
01:07:22,115 --> 01:07:24,106
You see those piles?

527
01:07:24,184 --> 01:07:26,118
They're sinking.

528
01:07:28,288 --> 01:07:32,349
Our chaps could drive those logs
till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.

529
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:35,258
Where would you build it?

530
01:07:35,328 --> 01:07:38,957
Further downstream, sir,
across those narrows.

531
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:42,263
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

532
01:07:42,335 --> 01:07:47,034
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

533
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:51,476
Not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.

534
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:57,448
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity;
no teamwork.

535
01:07:58,852 --> 01:08:01,946
Some parties are actually
working against each other.

536
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:05,622
Yes.

537
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:12,420
I tell you, gentlemen,
we have a problem on our hands.

538
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:15,468
Thanks to theJapanese,
we now command a rabble.

539
01:08:15,535 --> 01:08:17,799
There's no order, no discipline.

540
01:08:19,205 --> 01:08:22,368
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.

541
01:08:22,442 --> 01:08:27,470
It won't be easy,
but we have the means at hand.

542
01:08:27,547 --> 01:08:29,481
- The bridge.
- ''The bridge,'' sir?

543
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:36,416
We can teach these barbarians a lesson
in Western methods and efficiency...

544
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:38,184
that will put them to shame.

545
01:08:38,258 --> 01:08:40,988
We'll show them what the British
soldier is capable of doing.

546
01:08:41,061 --> 01:08:43,894
Yes, I see your point, sir.

547
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:46,898
It's going to be difficult
in this godforsaken place...

548
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:49,628
where you can't find
what you need.

549
01:08:49,702 --> 01:08:53,001
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

550
01:08:53,073 --> 01:08:55,701
You mean you really want them
to build a bridge?

551
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:58,573
You're not so usually slow
on the uptake, Evans.

552
01:08:58,645 --> 01:09:01,671
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

553
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:04,842
If there weren't any work
for them to do, we'd invent some.

554
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:08,012
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.

555
01:09:08,088 --> 01:09:11,023
But it will be a proper bridge.

556
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:13,184
Here again, I know the men.

557
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,558
It's essential that they should
take pride in their job.

558
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:18,358
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

559
01:09:18,431 --> 01:09:21,525
Reeves, you're the key man
in this situation as engineer.

560
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:23,865
Tell me what you want,
and Hughes and I will organize it.

561
01:09:23,937 --> 01:09:26,872
- Can we make a go of it?
- We'll do our best, sir.

562
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:29,033
Fine.

563
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:31,976
We must draw up our plans...

564
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:35,378
then arrange a conference
with Saito...

565
01:09:35,448 --> 01:09:38,042
and set him straight.

566
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:45,887
I think that takes care
of all the procedural matters.

567
01:09:45,959 --> 01:09:49,053
Now-- Oh, yes.

568
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:53,233
The next point is somewhat
unpleasant for all concerned.

569
01:09:53,466 --> 01:09:57,061
We feel the position of the bridge
was fixed rather hastily...

570
01:09:57,137 --> 01:09:59,833
and incorrectly.

571
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,573
Unfortunately, yes.

572
01:10:05,645 --> 01:10:08,409
Major Reeves, our engineer,
has made a careful study of the site...

573
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:12,008
and has come to the conclusion
that the river bottom there is too soft.

574
01:10:14,187 --> 01:10:17,088
Mud. All the work up to now
has been quite useless.

575
01:10:17,157 --> 01:10:18,458
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.

576
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:20,119
- Reeves, carry on.
- Yes, sir.

577
01:10:20,193 --> 01:10:22,058
Colonel Saito, I've made tests.

578
01:10:22,128 --> 01:10:25,564
Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.

579
01:10:25,632 --> 01:10:28,430
That bridge would collapse
under the first train to cross it.

580
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:30,765
Look, it's all here.

581
01:10:30,837 --> 01:10:33,101
These are the pressure
and soil resistance figures.

582
01:10:33,173 --> 01:10:35,767
Just a moment, Reeves,
before you get too involved.

583
01:10:35,842 --> 01:10:38,367
Colonel, can we have a cup of tea?

584
01:10:51,491 --> 01:10:55,450
Then we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

585
01:10:55,528 --> 01:10:58,292
we build a new bridge at the site
selected by Major Reeves...

586
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:01,162
400 yards downstream.

587
01:11:04,204 --> 01:11:06,306
Let's proceed to the next point.

588
01:11:06,306 --> 01:11:07,364
Let's proceed to the next point.

589
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,238
I've decided to alter
the daily work quota of our men.

590
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:12,301
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it...

591
01:11:12,378 --> 01:11:14,869
from a yard and a half
of earth moved to two yards.

592
01:11:14,948 --> 01:11:18,042
It's in the general interest,
and I was sure you would approve.

593
01:11:18,117 --> 01:11:18,151
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?

594
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:20,642
Major Hughes has all facts and figures.
Hughes, will you take over?

595
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,816
Yes, sir. I've done a time study
of the entire project.

596
01:11:24,891 --> 01:11:28,884
As you can see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

597
01:11:28,962 --> 01:11:32,693
I would strongly urge we revise
the organization of the working parties.

598
01:11:32,765 --> 01:11:34,323
Just a moment.

599
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,461
Colonel, it would save considerable time
if we could carry on during dinner.

600
01:11:38,538 --> 01:11:40,972
Would it be possible
to have a meal served here?

601
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,473
Of course.

602
01:11:45,912 --> 01:11:47,504
Carry on, Hughes.

603
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,141
If we increase the number of squads
and specialize the functions of each...

604
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:56,052
I'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30 percent.

605
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:58,852
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point.

606
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:05,526
There's another important decision
that can't be postponed.

607
01:12:05,598 --> 01:12:07,862
As most of the British soldiers
will be working on the bridge...

608
01:12:07,934 --> 01:12:11,062
only a small number will be available
for railway work.

609
01:12:11,137 --> 01:12:13,935
So I must ask you, Colonel Saito,
to lend us some of your own men...

610
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:16,202
to reinforce the railway gang...

611
01:12:16,276 --> 01:12:21,179
so the final stretch of track
can be completed as quickly as possible.

612
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,705
I have already given the order.

613
01:12:24,784 --> 01:12:27,878
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

614
01:12:27,954 --> 01:12:32,050
I thought of setting it at a yard
and a half, not to overtire them...

615
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:35,094
but wouldn't it be best if we made it
the same as the British soldiers?

616
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:38,289
That would also create
a healthy competitive spirit.

617
01:12:40,133 --> 01:12:43,694
I have already given the order.

618
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,671
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.

619
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:49,799
That completes the agenda
for this evening.

620
01:12:49,876 --> 01:12:53,573
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

621
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:56,513
Are there any other questions?

622
01:12:57,817 --> 01:13:00,081
One question.

623
01:13:00,153 --> 01:13:02,781
Can you finish the bridge in time?

624
01:13:02,855 --> 01:13:06,586
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible...

625
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:10,026
but we'll certainly give it a go.

626
01:13:10,096 --> 01:13:12,587
We mustn't forget
that we've wasted over a month...

627
01:13:12,665 --> 01:13:16,795
through an unfortunate disagreement,
for which I was not to blame.

628
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:20,205
Is there anything else?

629
01:13:22,675 --> 01:13:24,267
Thank you.

630
01:13:24,344 --> 01:13:27,575
The meeting is closed.

631
01:13:27,647 --> 01:13:29,945
Good night.

632
01:13:54,507 --> 01:13:59,376
I hope theseJapanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

633
01:13:59,445 --> 01:14:03,347
For the moment, I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

634
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:05,646
Good night.

635
01:14:08,388 --> 01:14:10,822
By the way, sir,
I meant to tell you...

636
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:13,882
there are trees in this forest
very similar to elm.

637
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,191
The elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

638
01:14:17,263 --> 01:14:21,324
- Six hundred years?
- Yes, sir.

639
01:14:24,904 --> 01:14:26,428
That would be something.

640
01:15:19,755 --> 01:15:23,657
Good morning. I'm looking
for an American named Commander Shears.

641
01:15:23,726 --> 01:15:26,718
- Yes. Down on the beach.
- Thank you very much.

642
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:36,400
Kiss!

643
01:15:36,472 --> 01:15:38,074
Too many eyes.

644
01:15:38,074 --> 01:15:38,938
Too many eyes.

645
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:43,445
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas...

646
01:15:43,512 --> 01:15:45,081
when all I need is love.

647
01:15:45,247 --> 01:15:47,738
It's true.
All you really need is love.

648
01:15:52,621 --> 01:15:55,920
What makes you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

649
01:15:55,992 --> 01:16:00,929
Because I'm a civilian at heart, lover,
and I always follow my heart.

650
01:16:00,997 --> 01:16:02,430
Kiss.

651
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:12,768
How's that, Commander?

652
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:17,343
Don't call me Commander.
It's unromantic.

653
01:16:17,413 --> 01:16:19,278
Look, you're an officer yourself.

654
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:22,511
How would you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

655
01:16:22,585 --> 01:16:25,053
Let's be democratic.
Just call me sir.

656
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:26,554
Yes, sir.

657
01:16:28,357 --> 01:16:29,881
Brass ahoy.

658
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:32,450
He wants to see you,
and he's all yours.

659
01:16:32,528 --> 01:16:34,792
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.

660
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:38,529
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.

661
01:16:38,601 --> 01:16:40,535
My name's Warden.

662
01:16:40,603 --> 01:16:42,571
- How do you do?
- I'm sorry to intrude.

663
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:46,404
That's okay, Major.
I'm used to it by now. Like a martini?

664
01:16:46,475 --> 01:16:49,672
- That's very kind, but I think not.
- Mind if I have one?

665
01:16:49,745 --> 01:16:52,646
- How did you manage to get that?
- This is a hospital, Major.

666
01:16:52,715 --> 01:16:54,979
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

667
01:16:55,051 --> 01:16:57,713
Of course.Jolly good.

668
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:00,654
I'll be as brief as possible.

669
01:17:00,723 --> 01:17:04,420
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 31 6.

670
01:17:04,493 --> 01:17:07,155
Our headquarters is up
in the botanical gardens.

671
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:09,163
Protecting rare plants
from the enemy?

672
01:17:09,231 --> 01:17:11,165
Not quite.

673
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,667
- Are you sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.

674
01:17:13,736 --> 01:17:18,002
Among other things, we have a particular
interest in that railway you worked on.

675
01:17:18,074 --> 01:17:21,339
You could give us no end
of very valuable information.

676
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:24,504
You know, Major, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

677
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:27,481
and I've already told your
intelligence people everything I know.

678
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:32,214
Yes, but you could help us
in a rather special sense.

679
01:17:32,288 --> 01:17:37,351
I know it's a terrible imposition,
but could you come out and see us?

680
01:17:38,928 --> 01:17:42,193
If you want to go over it again,
I'll come.

681
01:17:42,264 --> 01:17:44,960
That's very kind of you.
Lord Louis will be most grateful.

682
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:46,524
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.

683
01:17:46,602 --> 01:17:49,196
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- I see.

684
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:52,866
Shall we say this evening then,
about 8:00? I'll send a car for you.

685
01:17:52,942 --> 01:17:55,536
This evening?
Out of the question.

686
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:57,875
Tomorrow morning then,
about 1 0:00?

687
01:17:58,948 --> 01:18:01,382
Thanks very much.
Cheerio.

688
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:05,250
Good luck.

689
01:18:05,321 --> 01:18:06,754
Thanks.

690
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:18,560
I know. You're terribly sorry,
but you're standing me up tonight

691
01:18:18,634 --> 01:18:21,068
You couldn't be more wrong.

692
01:18:43,392 --> 01:18:45,917
- May I see your pass, sir?
- Yes.

693
01:18:49,165 --> 01:18:50,928
Carry on, driver.

694
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,601
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the pathway, sir.

695
01:19:01,677 --> 01:19:03,611
All right. Thanks.

696
01:19:14,089 --> 01:19:17,957
Good show,Jenkins!

697
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:21,827
Come along, Thomson!
Use your knife, man!

698
01:19:23,799 --> 01:19:25,301
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly. Move!

699
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:28,964
On your feet, chaps.
To the debriefing room quickly. Move!

700
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:34,301
Very clumsy,Joyce.

701
01:19:37,112 --> 01:19:40,479
Always use your knife
immediately,Joyce.

702
01:19:40,549 --> 01:19:43,143
You see?
He's gained the initiative.

703
01:19:43,219 --> 01:19:45,153
Wait a minute.

704
01:19:45,221 --> 01:19:48,247
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?

705
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:51,487
So am I, sir.
I thought you were the enemy, sir.

706
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,323
I'm an American,
if that's what you mean.

707
01:19:53,395 --> 01:19:56,831
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

708
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,827
What can I do for you, sir?

709
01:19:59,902 --> 01:20:03,133
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.
- Yes, I'll show you the way, sir.

710
01:20:03,205 --> 01:20:05,674
He should be finishing his lecture
at any moment now.

711
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:15,878
- That's the end of his lecture, sir.
- Thunderous ovation.

712
01:20:15,951 --> 01:20:16,185
The major believes in keeping training
as close to real life as possible, sir.

713
01:20:16,185 --> 01:20:19,848
The major believes in keeping training
as close to real life as possible, sir.

714
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:24,726
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?

715
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:28,160
Very good of you to come along.
Have they been taking care of you?

716
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:31,529
- They certainly have.
- Thank you.

717
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,037
Come along then. Colonel Green
is looking forward to meeting you.

718
01:20:36,939 --> 01:20:39,032
Fascinating place, isn't it?

719
01:20:39,108 --> 01:20:42,373
Utterly charming. I didn't realize
it was a commando school.

720
01:20:42,444 --> 01:20:44,378
We're discouraging
the use of that word.

721
01:20:44,446 --> 01:20:47,643
It has such a melodramatic air.

722
01:20:47,716 --> 01:20:51,743
- What do you do here?
- Sabotage, demolition.

723
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,050
We're using plastic explosives now.
It's wonderful stuff.

724
01:20:55,124 --> 01:20:58,059
That last little pop was made
with a lump half the size of this.

725
01:20:58,127 --> 01:21:01,654
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
and only half the weight. Here.

726
01:21:02,798 --> 01:21:05,926
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

727
01:21:06,001 --> 01:21:07,696
Thanks for telling me.

728
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:11,672
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic. See?

729
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,731
You can do what you like with it.

730
01:21:14,643 --> 01:21:16,736
This is my place.

731
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,184
Go ahead.

732
01:21:25,121 --> 01:21:27,385
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

733
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:32,220
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

734
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:34,559
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

735
01:21:34,631 --> 01:21:37,657
- A pot of tea for one, Peter.
- Very good, sir.

736
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:43,202
Do you read this?

737
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:47,437
I taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.

738
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:54,545
By the way, I never congratulated you
on your escape. It was a good show.

739
01:21:52,014 --> 01:21:55,864
I was lucky. If your sea rescue plane
hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

740
01:21:55,936 --> 01:21:57,369
I suppose not.

741
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,901
Would you like
to see where you were?

742
01:22:03,977 --> 01:22:05,410
All right.

743
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:10,780
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.

744
01:22:10,851 --> 01:22:12,785
But we think the camp
is about here.

745
01:22:12,853 --> 01:22:17,355
Do your intelligence people have any
idea what happened to Colonel Nicholson?

746
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:19,289
He had the guts of a maniac.

747
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:21,293
They were about to shoot him,
and he didn't bat an eye.

748
01:22:21,361 --> 01:22:24,626
I suppose if you're about to be shot,
there isn't a great deal you can do.

749
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,628
Here is the River Kwai...

750
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,328
and here is the Siamese village
where you were helped...

751
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,166
and here is the railway.

752
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:34,002
You must be fairly familiar
with all this area.

753
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,668
Not really.
I was out of my head half the time.

754
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,803
Now then, the railway starts
down here in Singapore.

755
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,474
Malaya, Bangkok, Rangoon.

756
01:22:42,549 --> 01:22:45,541
Their idea is
to drive on through into India.

757
01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:47,314
Where was I picked up?

758
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:49,514
About here.

759
01:22:49,589 --> 01:22:54,549
As you know, theJapanese aim to open
the Bangkok-Rangoon section by mid-May.

760
01:22:54,628 --> 01:22:54,861
Naturally,
we'll try to prevent them.

761
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,988
Naturally,
we'll try to prevent them.

762
01:22:57,064 --> 01:23:00,033
It's too far for bombers
to carry an adequate load...

763
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,625
so we shall have to go in
and smash it up on the ground.

764
01:23:02,703 --> 01:23:05,501
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop and then march.

765
01:23:05,572 --> 01:23:09,064
- With demolition equipment?
- Yes.

766
01:23:09,142 --> 01:23:13,442
Our chief problem is lack
of firsthand knowledge.

767
01:23:13,513 --> 01:23:16,141
None of us have ever been there.

768
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:19,481
- I don't want to discourage you, but--
- It should be interesting.

769
01:23:19,553 --> 01:23:21,521
Colonel Green has given me
the Kwai bridge.

770
01:23:21,588 --> 01:23:25,046
I'm taking a team in
and blow it up.

771
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,558
Lucky you.

772
01:23:29,496 --> 01:23:32,056
- Are you sure you won't have tea?
- No, thanks.

773
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:36,034
I don't want to be rude, but I have
a luncheon date, and she's beautiful.

774
01:23:36,103 --> 01:23:39,869
- So if there are any questions--
- Yes, of course. I am sorry.

775
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:47,608
There is only one question, actually.
How would you feel about going back?

776
01:23:50,283 --> 01:23:51,716
Come again?

777
01:23:51,785 --> 01:23:54,686
I know under the circumstances
it's a bit much...

778
01:23:54,755 --> 01:23:58,953
but you do have a unique knowledge
for our purpose...

779
01:23:59,025 --> 01:24:01,016
and we'd love to have you with us.

780
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:07,229
You mean to tell me
you brought me here to ask me this?

781
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,063
Frankly, yes.

782
01:24:09,136 --> 01:24:13,402
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.

783
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:15,407
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous.

784
01:24:15,475 --> 01:24:18,911
- This is embarrassing.
- I can't go back!

785
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:20,742
I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.

786
01:24:20,814 --> 01:24:24,910
Actually, Colonel Green has already
taken up the manner with your people.

787
01:24:24,985 --> 01:24:28,978
- With my people?
- Yes, your navy turned you over to us.

788
01:24:29,055 --> 01:24:33,082
A signal arrived yesterday morning
from your C in C Pacific...

789
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,358
authorizing your temporary
transfer of duty to Force 31 6.

790
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:40,331
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.

791
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,426
It was difficult
to know how to break it to you.

792
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:45,437
They can't do this to me.

793
01:24:45,505 --> 01:24:47,598
My navy's made a mistake.

794
01:24:50,744 --> 01:24:50,977
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

795
01:24:50,977 --> 01:24:56,108
Look, I'm not a navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

796
01:24:56,183 --> 01:25:01,951
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just
an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

797
01:25:04,024 --> 01:25:08,085
When the Houston sunk,
I made it ashore with an officer.

798
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:11,392
Later, we ran into a Japanese patrol,
and he was killed.

799
01:25:11,464 --> 01:25:15,025
I figured I would be captured, so--

800
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:18,004
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

801
01:25:18,004 --> 01:25:18,299
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

802
01:25:18,371 --> 01:25:21,101
I thought officers would get
better treatment in prison camps.

803
01:25:21,174 --> 01:25:23,472
- Very sensible.
- Not that it did me any good.

804
01:25:23,543 --> 01:25:26,103
At Saito's camp, the officers
worked along with the rest.

805
01:25:26,179 --> 01:25:28,875
Yes, there's always the unexpected.

806
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:34,318
I got used to being a commander...

807
01:25:34,387 --> 01:25:36,981
so when I arrived here
at the hospital...

808
01:25:37,057 --> 01:25:41,494
I looked at the enlisted men's ward
and the officers' ward...

809
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:47,329
and I said to myself,
'' Let's let it ride along for awhile.''

810
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,095
There were certain
definite advantages.

811
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:51,160
Yes, I saw one on the beach.

812
01:25:51,238 --> 01:25:53,672
Anyway, that's the whole story.

813
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,334
The point is that you can't use me.

814
01:25:56,409 --> 01:26:00,778
You want an American commander named
Shears, and he doesn't exist.

815
01:26:00,847 --> 01:26:03,008
When the Navy brass learns
the truth about me, they'll say...

816
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:06,644
''Ship him home in irons
for impersonating an officer!''

817
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,348
Once that happens,
I've got it made.

818
01:26:09,422 --> 01:26:11,287
- Got it what?
- '' Made.''

819
01:26:11,358 --> 01:26:13,918
- I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.

820
01:26:13,994 --> 01:26:16,656
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

821
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:22,032
I'll say I impersonated an officer
because I went crazy in the jungle.

822
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:24,999
I'm getting worse, you know?

823
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:27,130
Sometimes I think
I'm Admiral Halsey.

824
01:26:27,207 --> 01:26:29,573
That's a clever plan.

825
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:33,010
It's not only clever,
it's foolproof.

826
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:35,547
When my navy finds out who I am...

827
01:26:35,615 --> 01:26:38,743
those temporary orders won't be worth
the paper they're written on.

828
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,360
Is this your photograph?

829
01:26:58,138 --> 01:27:01,403
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing.

830
01:27:01,474 --> 01:27:03,738
Naturally, your people couldn't
identify you at first.

831
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:08,804
But finally your C in C Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record:

832
01:27:08,882 --> 01:27:10,816
the photograph, fingerprints.

833
01:27:10,884 --> 01:27:13,045
It has everything.
Would you care to have a look?

834
01:27:14,955 --> 01:27:19,255
We've known about your actual rank
for nearly a week.

835
01:27:22,095 --> 01:27:24,962
Your navy's in an awkward position.

836
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:25,131
In one sense, you're a hero
for making an escape from the jungle.

837
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:30,091
In one sense, you're a hero
for making an escape from the jungle.

838
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:33,264
But they can't very well
bring you home...

839
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:37,071
and give you the Navy Cross
for impersonating an officer.

840
01:27:37,143 --> 01:27:40,704
I suppose that's why they were happy
to hand you over to us.

841
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,874
- You see?
- Hot potato.

842
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:46,942
As far as your present rank
is concerned...

843
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:50,615
we're fairly informal
about those things in Force 31 6.

844
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:53,124
So you'll have
a simulated rank of major.

845
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,795
A simulated major.
That figures.

846
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:07,674
As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.

847
01:28:07,807 --> 01:28:10,105
Good show.

848
01:28:11,177 --> 01:28:14,977
Colonel Green,
this is Major Shears.

849
01:28:15,048 --> 01:28:18,814
He has just volunteered to go back
and help me blow up the Kwai Bridge.

850
01:28:18,885 --> 01:28:20,318
Really?

851
01:28:21,388 --> 01:28:23,151
Good show.

852
01:28:23,223 --> 01:28:25,657
Jolly good show, Major.

853
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,705
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.

854
01:29:18,778 --> 01:29:20,871
The colonel might think
I'm malingering, sir.

855
01:29:20,947 --> 01:29:23,541
I'm the medical officer.
Get cracking.

856
01:29:29,222 --> 01:29:33,352
Will someone tell me why the old man
wants us to build a proper bridge?

857
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:37,021
Don't worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.

858
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:51,775
It's about time you paid a visit.

859
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:54,609
Fine job our chaps are doing.
Really first rate.

860
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:57,149
Yes. How's he behaving?

861
01:29:57,217 --> 01:30:00,015
He's been most reasonable
since we took over.

862
01:30:00,086 --> 01:30:03,249
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.

863
01:30:03,323 --> 01:30:06,019
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.

864
01:30:06,092 --> 01:30:08,390
What do you think?

865
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:10,395
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

866
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,636
Sir, are you convinced
building this bridge is a good idea?

867
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,535
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.

868
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:24,009
''A good idea''?
Let's take another look.

869
01:30:24,077 --> 01:30:26,068
You don't agree
the men's morale is high...

870
01:30:26,146 --> 01:30:28,341
that discipline has been restored...

871
01:30:28,414 --> 01:30:30,609
that their condition
has been improved?

872
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:33,345
- Aren't they a happier lot?
- Yes, sir, but--

873
01:30:33,419 --> 01:30:36,252
They feel better, and they are
no longer abused or maltreated.

874
01:30:36,322 --> 01:30:38,256
- That's all true.
- Well then?

875
01:30:38,324 --> 01:30:41,350
Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when I don't understand you at all.

876
01:30:41,427 --> 01:30:43,554
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.

877
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:48,966
The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as...

878
01:30:49,035 --> 01:30:50,866
collaboration with the enemy...

879
01:30:50,937 --> 01:30:52,871
perhaps even as treasonable activity.

880
01:30:52,939 --> 01:30:54,531
Are you all right?

881
01:30:54,607 --> 01:30:57,098
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse work.

882
01:30:57,177 --> 01:30:57,343
I understand that, sir,
but must we work so well?

883
01:30:57,343 --> 01:31:00,574
I understand that, sir,
but must we work so well?

884
01:31:00,647 --> 01:31:04,708
Must we build them a better bridge
than they could have built themselves?

885
01:31:04,784 --> 01:31:09,016
If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?

886
01:31:10,523 --> 01:31:13,219
Would you prefer to see this battalion
disintegrate in idleness?

887
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:16,160
Would you have it said
that our chaps can't do a proper job?

888
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:18,390
Don't you realize how important it is
to show these people...

889
01:31:18,464 --> 01:31:21,331
they can't break us
in body or in spirit?

890
01:31:21,401 --> 01:31:23,995
Take a good look.

891
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:26,732
One day the war will be over.

892
01:31:26,806 --> 01:31:30,173
I hope the people who use this bridge
in years to come...

893
01:31:30,243 --> 01:31:33,838
will remember how it was built
and who built it.

894
01:31:33,913 --> 01:31:36,541
Not a gang of slaves,
but soldiers.

895
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:40,052
- British soldiers even in captivity.
- Yes, sir.

896
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:44,351
You're a fine doctor, but you've a lot
to learn about the army.

897
01:32:08,514 --> 01:32:10,209
Hold it!

898
01:32:10,283 --> 01:32:13,684
Use your boot.
Get your boot in there.

899
01:32:21,794 --> 01:32:23,227
Good morning.

900
01:32:36,909 --> 01:32:39,434
What on Earth
are you people staring at?

901
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,446
Get on with your jobs!

902
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,407
Get him with your boot!

903
01:32:57,363 --> 01:33:00,764
- I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
- Four minutes late, to be exact.

904
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,892
You were in need
of medical attention?

905
01:33:02,969 --> 01:33:06,268
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.

906
01:33:06,339 --> 01:33:09,069
Yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.

907
01:33:09,142 --> 01:33:11,440
Sit down.

908
01:33:11,511 --> 01:33:13,240
Now, the main reason
I asked you here today...

909
01:33:13,313 --> 01:33:15,873
was to help us pick the fourth member
of your team.

910
01:33:15,948 --> 01:33:18,940
- Ask Mr.Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.

911
01:33:19,018 --> 01:33:22,454
Chapman here wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts about him.

912
01:33:22,522 --> 01:33:26,515
I think he has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.

913
01:33:26,592 --> 01:33:29,720
As I've told you before, in a job
like yours, even when it's finished...

914
01:33:29,796 --> 01:33:32,390
there's always one more thing to do.

915
01:33:32,465 --> 01:33:35,127
He's the best swimmer in the school,
sir, and we'll need a good swimmer.

916
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:39,137
Yes, I'm well aware of your evaluation,
Chapman. I want Shears' opinion.

917
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:45,010
All right, at ease.

918
01:33:49,716 --> 01:33:53,413
These gentlemen are thinking of taking
you for a little hike into the jungle.

919
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:55,681
Yes, sir.

920
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,882
You were an accountant in Montreal?

921
01:33:57,957 --> 01:34:02,189
Yes, sir. Not really an accountant, sir.
That is, I didn't have my charter.

922
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,320
Exactly what did you do then?

923
01:34:04,397 --> 01:34:08,629
Sir, I just checked columns and columns
of figures...

924
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:11,534
which three or four people
had checked before me...

925
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:14,937
and then other people checked them
after I had checked them.

926
01:34:15,007 --> 01:34:16,634
Sounds a frightful bore.

927
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:18,643
Sir, it was a frightful bore.

928
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:20,303
How did you wind up here?

929
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,110
Sir, in '39, I came over to London
to enlist...

930
01:34:23,182 --> 01:34:25,707
and about two years later,
I volunteered for this work.

931
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:29,585
- You volunteered?
- Yes, sir. You see, the regular army--

932
01:34:29,655 --> 01:34:31,452
Go ahead. You can be frank.

933
01:34:31,524 --> 01:34:37,087
Sir, the regular army sort of
reminded me of my job in civilian life.

934
01:34:37,163 --> 01:34:39,097
They don't expect you to think.

935
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:43,658
Think about this.

936
01:34:43,736 --> 01:34:46,637
Are you quite sure
you'd be able to use it in cold blood?

937
01:34:46,706 --> 01:34:48,367
I know how to use it, sir.

938
01:34:48,441 --> 01:34:50,568
That's not what I meant.

939
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,634
Could you use it in cold blood?

940
01:34:52,712 --> 01:34:56,170
Could you kill without hesitation?

941
01:34:56,249 --> 01:34:59,184
That's a question
I've often asked myself, sir.

942
01:34:59,252 --> 01:35:01,584
It's worried me quite a bit.

943
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:03,884
What was the answer?

944
01:35:03,956 --> 01:35:06,516
I don't honestly know, sir.

945
01:35:06,592 --> 01:35:09,220
I've tried to imagine myself--

946
01:35:11,264 --> 01:35:15,564
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.

947
01:35:15,635 --> 01:35:17,967
It's an old army problem.

948
01:35:18,037 --> 01:35:21,598
I think that's all.
Thank you,Joyce.

949
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:28,574
- Am I to go with the team, sir?
- We'll let you know.

950
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,484
Now you see what I mean?

951
01:35:37,557 --> 01:35:39,650
At least he was honest about it, sir.

952
01:35:39,725 --> 01:35:44,424
None of us ever knows the answer to
that question until the moment arises.

953
01:35:44,497 --> 01:35:45,964
What's your opinion, Shears?

954
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:48,766
He's Canadian.

955
01:35:48,835 --> 01:35:53,738
That's in keeping with the international
composition of this outfit.

956
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:56,070
If he wants to go that bad,
he can even take my place.

957
01:35:56,142 --> 01:36:00,374
If you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.

958
01:36:00,446 --> 01:36:04,212
Now then, I've had a report from
air reconnaissance on that village.

959
01:36:04,283 --> 01:36:07,411
There's sufficient clearing
to make your jump at last light.

960
01:36:07,487 --> 01:36:10,820
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.

961
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,723
Blast. This is awkward.

962
01:36:13,793 --> 01:36:16,387
Silly, it never occurred to me.

963
01:36:16,462 --> 01:36:18,862
- In that case, maybe--
- Yes, he's right.

964
01:36:18,931 --> 01:36:21,092
We'd better arrange some practice jumps
for him immediately.

965
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,226
I'll pop over and check with Freddy
right away.

966
01:36:23,302 --> 01:36:24,963
All right, Chapman.
You can run along.

967
01:36:25,037 --> 01:36:26,470
Yes, sir.

968
01:36:28,674 --> 01:36:32,633
- Feel like a sniff of air?
- Yes, sir.

969
01:36:32,712 --> 01:36:35,704
You don't realize
what a plum you are for us.

970
01:36:35,781 --> 01:36:39,376
Your knowledge of the area,
your making friends in that village.

971
01:36:39,452 --> 01:36:43,354
It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.

972
01:36:46,459 --> 01:36:50,452
By the way, here's something
that will interest you: the new L pill.

973
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:55,628
- '' L pill''?
- L for lethal; instantaneous, painless.

974
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:59,193
Much better than the old ones.
For capture of course.

975
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:01,797
In other words,
you're telling me not to be taken alive.

976
01:37:01,874 --> 01:37:04,274
I wouldn't recommend it.

977
01:37:04,343 --> 01:37:06,573
You see, if any of you get hurt
or wounded on the trek...

978
01:37:06,646 --> 01:37:08,705
the others will have
to leave him behind.

979
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,750
The objective comes first
in our work.

980
01:37:11,817 --> 01:37:14,479
Colonel, you want my honest evaluation
of this team?

981
01:37:14,554 --> 01:37:16,545
I didn't want to speak out
in front of the others.

982
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:18,556
I understand. Go ahead.

983
01:37:19,892 --> 01:37:23,328
Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.

984
01:37:23,396 --> 01:37:26,297
Joyce is-- He'll be okay.

985
01:37:26,365 --> 01:37:29,266
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Why not?

986
01:37:29,335 --> 01:37:31,235
Cambridge don and all that.

987
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:34,831
It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers, but--

988
01:37:34,907 --> 01:37:36,499
He's not without experience.

989
01:37:38,344 --> 01:37:41,177
When we lost Singapore, he stayed behind
and blew up a couple of bridges...

990
01:37:41,247 --> 01:37:43,772
one or two trains and I don't know
how many other installations...

991
01:37:43,849 --> 01:37:45,441
before theJaps caught him.

992
01:37:45,518 --> 01:37:48,043
- ''Caught him''?
- Yes. Fascinating story.

993
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:49,678
Sir, it's most annoying.

994
01:37:49,755 --> 01:37:51,689
They say,
in view of the time element...

995
01:37:51,757 --> 01:37:54,885
they don't think a few practice jumps
would be worthwhile.

996
01:37:54,961 --> 01:37:58,692
They say if you make one jump,
you've only got 50% chance of injury...

997
01:37:58,764 --> 01:38:02,291
two jumps, 80% and three jumps,
you're bound to catch a backache.

998
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:06,236
The consensus is that the most sensible
thing for Major Shears to do...

999
01:38:06,305 --> 01:38:09,900
is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.

1000
01:38:09,976 --> 01:38:12,240
With or without parachute?

1001
01:38:17,149 --> 01:38:19,276
Very good, old man.

1002
01:38:22,888 --> 01:38:24,822
''With or without--''

1003
01:39:21,681 --> 01:39:22,841
He's in the trees.

1004
01:40:01,754 --> 01:40:04,587
Yai says we'll never reach the Kwai
by the route you took.

1005
01:40:04,657 --> 01:40:06,716
There are too many
Japanese patrols now.

1006
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:08,894
We'll have to swing north
through heavy jungle.

1007
01:40:08,894 --> 01:40:09,258
We'll have to swing north
through heavy jungle.

1008
01:40:09,328 --> 01:40:11,592
- Who's leading?
- Yai himself.

1009
01:40:11,664 --> 01:40:14,394
He hates theJapanese. They've taken
all his men for railroad work...

1010
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:17,300
which means we shall have
to use women bearers.

1011
01:40:17,369 --> 01:40:17,403
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.

1012
01:40:17,403 --> 01:40:19,735
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.

1013
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:34,476
He says it's dangerous
to spend the night in the village.

1014
01:40:34,553 --> 01:40:36,851
There's an enemy post
about three miles away...

1015
01:40:36,922 --> 01:40:39,083
so we shall have to sleep
in the jungle.

1016
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:42,184
- What about Chapman, sir?
- Yai's people will bury him...

1017
01:40:42,261 --> 01:40:44,058
and his chute.

1018
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:46,496
Is there something wrong?

1019
01:40:46,565 --> 01:40:48,897
I was just thinking.

1020
01:40:48,968 --> 01:40:51,801
You speak Yai's language,
I don't.

1021
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:53,896
He's leading you back
to the river Kwai himself...

1022
01:40:53,973 --> 01:40:55,907
by a route I never took.

1023
01:40:55,975 --> 01:40:59,911
Will someone tell me why
I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

1024
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:04,473
I know how you feel,
but there's always the unexpected.

1025
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,745
Tell that to Chapman.

1026
01:41:06,819 --> 01:41:08,252
Let's get cracking.

1027
01:41:55,868 --> 01:41:57,301
Go ahead.

1028
01:44:12,504 --> 01:44:13,937
You're lovely.

1029
01:44:18,177 --> 01:44:20,543
Be happy in your work.

1030
01:44:20,612 --> 01:44:22,045
Yes, sir.

1031
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:50,971
Leeches.

1032
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:12,360
She's telling you to hold still.
She wants to take the leeches off you.

1033
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:15,093
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

1034
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,692
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese,
if you like.

1035
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:19,499
That would spoil it.

1036
01:45:19,571 --> 01:45:21,505
Too much talk always spoils it.

1037
01:45:21,573 --> 01:45:23,837
- What's wrong with that thing,Joyce?
- I don't know, sir.

1038
01:45:23,909 --> 01:45:26,844
It's taken a beating.
I can't get a strong signal.

1039
01:45:26,912 --> 01:45:28,539
I'll tell you what's wrong with it.

1040
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,605
It's wet, mildewed,
corroded, rotten...

1041
01:45:30,682 --> 01:45:32,582
like everything else
in this rotten jungle.

1042
01:45:32,651 --> 01:45:34,414
You might as well dump it.

1043
01:45:39,558 --> 01:45:41,822
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

1044
01:45:41,894 --> 01:45:43,885
This is your friendliest enemy...

1045
01:45:43,962 --> 01:45:46,522
reminding you to take it easy...

1046
01:45:46,598 --> 01:45:49,032
and never volunteer for anything.

1047
01:46:02,414 --> 01:46:04,541
If we stay here much longer,
we'll be up to our necks.

1048
01:46:04,616 --> 01:46:06,811
- I have it all decoded, sir.
- Right. Read it.

1049
01:46:06,885 --> 01:46:11,288
Yes, sir. ''One: Original bridge works
reported abandoned.

1050
01:46:11,356 --> 01:46:14,018
New construction downstream
from first site.

1051
01:46:14,093 --> 01:46:16,789
Two: Enemy intends to open railway...

1052
01:46:16,862 --> 01:46:19,490
with passage of special train,
Bangkok for Rangoon...

1053
01:46:19,565 --> 01:46:21,499
with troops and VI P...

1054
01:46:21,567 --> 01:46:24,297
estimated to arrive target
morning 1 3th.

1055
01:46:24,369 --> 01:46:27,770
Three: You should synchronize demolition
with passage this train.

1056
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,071
Four: Good hunting. Have fun.''
That's all, sir.

1057
01:46:31,143 --> 01:46:33,008
A train and a bridge
would be something.

1058
01:46:33,078 --> 01:46:35,638
Yes, sir, that would really be a show.
Can we get there in time, sir?

1059
01:46:35,714 --> 01:46:38,205
Yai says we're two to three days' march
from the Kwai.

1060
01:46:38,383 --> 01:46:42,820
If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 1 2th.

1061
01:46:42,888 --> 01:46:44,822
It's worth having a go for the train,
don't you think?

1062
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:46,619
By all means.

1063
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:48,421
Good hunting. Good show.

1064
01:46:48,494 --> 01:46:50,587
Jolly good fun.

1065
01:46:50,662 --> 01:46:54,621
If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.

1066
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:58,033
There's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

1067
01:47:03,442 --> 01:47:04,875
Heave!

1068
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:25,495
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.

1069
01:47:27,499 --> 01:47:29,831
We'll complete this later.

1070
01:47:31,103 --> 01:47:35,267
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?

1071
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,800
I've spoken with Reeves and Hughes,
and we won't finish the bridge on time.

1072
01:47:39,878 --> 01:47:41,436
We just haven't the manpower.

1073
01:47:41,513 --> 01:47:44,812
I've asked the officers to help and
they've agreed, but that won't do it.

1074
01:47:44,883 --> 01:47:46,817
The officers are working
on the bridge?

1075
01:47:46,885 --> 01:47:50,844
Yes. I explained the situation, and
they volunteered, but it's not enough.

1076
01:47:50,923 --> 01:47:53,687
- Ask Saito for some of his men.
- Wouldn't dream of it.

1077
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:56,319
This is our show.
We must use our own resources.

1078
01:47:56,395 --> 01:47:59,421
I came to talk to you
about the sick list.

1079
01:47:59,498 --> 01:48:03,195
Sir, there's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.

1080
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:04,701
Don't jump to conclusions.

1081
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:08,399
No reflection on you, but there are
always a few malingerers.

1082
01:48:08,473 --> 01:48:11,101
Be honest.
Keep an open mind is all I ask.

1083
01:48:11,176 --> 01:48:13,440
Come along. Let's see.

1084
01:48:14,513 --> 01:48:15,946
Don't move.

1085
01:48:20,185 --> 01:48:21,777
What's the matter with Haskins?

1086
01:48:21,853 --> 01:48:23,821
He has amebic dysentery
and blackwater fever.

1087
01:48:23,889 --> 01:48:26,983
- His temperature was 1 04 last night.
- Right, I see.

1088
01:48:30,329 --> 01:48:32,854
- And this man?
- Leg ulcers.

1089
01:48:32,931 --> 01:48:35,900
I may be able to save the leg
if I do some more cutting tonight.

1090
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,095
Do you really want
to send him out to work, sir?

1091
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:39,637
Don't talk rot.

1092
01:48:44,509 --> 01:48:47,171
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.

1093
01:48:47,246 --> 01:48:49,771
Most of them are so run-down,
their wounds won't heal properly.

1094
01:48:49,848 --> 01:48:52,612
Yes, but I wonder if fresh air
and light duties...

1095
01:48:52,684 --> 01:48:55,585
might do him more good
than being cooped up here.

1096
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,918
It's not our policy
to keep a man in the hospital...

1097
01:48:57,990 --> 01:48:59,958
just because
he scratched his arm, is it?

1098
01:49:00,025 --> 01:49:01,927
- '' Not our policy''?
- Is it?

1099
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:06,454
A man may not be on the top of his form,
but he can still make himself useful...

1100
01:49:06,531 --> 01:49:08,761
trimming and finishing jobs.

1101
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:10,267
Stand easy, Baker.

1102
01:49:10,335 --> 01:49:13,634
Tell me, do you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?

1103
01:49:15,607 --> 01:49:17,939
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.

1104
01:49:19,478 --> 01:49:21,070
What about you?
Nothing difficult.

1105
01:49:21,146 --> 01:49:23,580
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

1106
01:49:25,417 --> 01:49:27,214
Look here, men.

1107
01:49:27,286 --> 01:49:30,255
It goes without saying,
I'm proud of all of you...

1108
01:49:30,322 --> 01:49:32,552
but we are facing a crisis.

1109
01:49:32,624 --> 01:49:37,118
For those who feel up to it,
how about lending the others a hand?

1110
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:39,322
Fetch and carry.
A spot of paint here and there.

1111
01:49:39,398 --> 01:49:41,127
What do you say?

1112
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:44,794
- Yes, sir.
- Good show. Follow me.

1113
01:51:26,538 --> 01:51:28,403
Ten minutes.

1114
01:53:26,224 --> 01:53:29,022
Make sure they're all dead.

1115
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,196
Come on,Joyce.

1116
01:53:34,866 --> 01:53:37,994
Use your knife, man,
or we'll be shooting each other.

1117
01:53:50,181 --> 01:53:52,046
Go that way.

1118
01:55:59,644 --> 01:56:03,205
I could have done it.
I was ready.

1119
01:56:07,719 --> 01:56:09,346
Are you hit, sir?

1120
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:10,854
Let's go.

1121
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:35,807
It's superficial.
There's nothing broken.

1122
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:38,371
- It's my fault, sir.
- Shut up,Joyce.

1123
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,884
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts now.

1124
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:45,389
- Yeah, but how far and how fast?
- We won't know till I try.

1125
01:59:58,316 --> 02:00:00,284
What are you doing?

1126
02:00:00,351 --> 02:00:02,546
I didn't give orders for a halt.

1127
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,247
We all need it.

1128
02:00:08,092 --> 02:00:11,892
We're still five hours fast march
from the objective.

1129
02:00:11,963 --> 02:00:15,626
Maybe six. Come on.

1130
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,533
You keep walking on that foot,
you'll bleed to death.

1131
02:00:19,837 --> 02:00:21,600
Yeah.

1132
02:00:25,743 --> 02:00:29,008
- You're going to leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.

1133
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:32,481
You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.

1134
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:34,848
You've got to get there
before sundown.

1135
02:00:34,919 --> 02:00:39,447
Sir, when the job's done, who knows
if we can return by this route...

1136
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:41,992
or whether we could find you
if we did.

1137
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:45,894
If you were in my shoes, you know
I wouldn't hesitate to leave you here.

1138
02:00:45,964 --> 02:00:47,795
He doesn't know it, but I do.

1139
02:00:47,865 --> 02:00:50,060
You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.

1140
02:00:51,736 --> 02:00:55,137
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.

1141
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:56,798
You're in command, Shears.

1142
02:01:00,478 --> 02:01:02,810
I won't obey that order.

1143
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,815
You make me sick with your heroics.
There's a stench of death about you.

1144
02:01:05,883 --> 02:01:07,817
You carry it in your pack
like the plague.

1145
02:01:07,885 --> 02:01:10,115
Explosives and L pills
go well together.

1146
02:01:10,188 --> 02:01:11,815
With you,
it's just one thing or the other:

1147
02:01:11,889 --> 02:01:13,948
destroy a bridge
or destroy yourself.

1148
02:01:14,025 --> 02:01:16,118
This war is just a game.

1149
02:01:16,194 --> 02:01:18,094
You and that Colonel Nicholson
are two of a kind.

1150
02:01:18,162 --> 02:01:20,221
Crazy with courage!
For what?

1151
02:01:20,298 --> 02:01:23,426
How to die like a gentleman.
How to die by the rules.

1152
02:01:23,501 --> 02:01:27,267
The only important thing
is how to live like a human being!

1153
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:35,375
I'm not gonna leave you here
to die, Warden...

1154
02:01:35,446 --> 02:01:39,610
because I don't care
about your bridge and your rules.

1155
02:01:39,684 --> 02:01:42,346
If we go on, we go on together.

1156
02:01:45,356 --> 02:01:47,290
Good old Yai.

1157
02:01:58,936 --> 02:02:00,528
I'm all right.

1158
02:02:10,815 --> 02:02:12,248
Come on.

1159
02:03:01,432 --> 02:03:03,229
Let's get closer.

1160
02:03:21,886 --> 02:03:24,946
Still sorry we brought you along?

1161
02:03:26,524 --> 02:03:28,719
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

1162
02:03:28,793 --> 02:03:30,920
You're in command again.

1163
02:03:30,995 --> 02:03:33,463
Thank you, Major.

1164
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:35,294
I can't understand it.

1165
02:03:35,366 --> 02:03:38,767
It's such a solid,
well-designed job.

1166
02:03:41,305 --> 02:03:44,365
Not like the temporary bridges
the enemy usually throws together.

1167
02:03:44,442 --> 02:03:45,875
Look.

1168
02:03:47,712 --> 02:03:49,873
Those poor devils down there.

1169
02:03:49,947 --> 02:03:51,881
Imagine being forced
to build something like that...

1170
02:03:51,949 --> 02:03:53,883
in the condition they must be in.

1171
02:03:53,951 --> 02:03:58,012
They've got a British officer
working down there on his knees.

1172
02:03:58,089 --> 02:04:00,387
TheJapanese seem to be enjoying it.

1173
02:04:00,458 --> 02:04:04,656
If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale a little.

1174
02:04:23,648 --> 02:04:26,851
If it wasn't for the train,
we could set a time fuse and leave.

1175
02:04:26,851 --> 02:04:27,374
If it wasn't for the train,
we could set a time fuse and leave.

1176
02:04:27,451 --> 02:04:30,181
But since we don't know what time
it will cross tomorrow morning...

1177
02:04:30,254 --> 02:04:32,222
we'll have to do the job manually.

1178
02:04:33,391 --> 02:04:36,326
We'll set the charges
against the piles...

1179
02:04:36,394 --> 02:04:40,023
about three feet under the water,
I should think...

1180
02:04:40,097 --> 02:04:43,498
and run the main wire downstream
to the plunger.

1181
02:04:44,835 --> 02:04:47,326
The problem is
where to hide it.

1182
02:04:52,877 --> 02:04:55,812
Our side of the river is quite
obviously used by theJapanese.

1183
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:58,007
They'd spot it at once.

1184
02:05:01,919 --> 02:05:05,116
Look.
You see those fallen tree trunks...

1185
02:05:05,189 --> 02:05:08,590
and the gray rock just below them
on that little beach?

1186
02:05:08,659 --> 02:05:10,388
Yes, sir, I see them.

1187
02:05:10,461 --> 02:05:12,656
That's our key position.

1188
02:05:12,730 --> 02:05:14,698
It's on the wrong side
of the river...

1189
02:05:14,765 --> 02:05:18,462
but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.

1190
02:05:20,371 --> 02:05:22,737
As soon as the bridge goes up...

1191
02:05:22,807 --> 02:05:25,776
whoever's there
will have to swim back.

1192
02:05:25,843 --> 02:05:28,175
It's not likely
to be a pleasant swim.

1193
02:05:28,246 --> 02:05:30,840
Sir, I was the best swimmer
in my course.

1194
02:05:30,915 --> 02:05:33,543
Yeah.

1195
02:05:33,618 --> 02:05:37,281
- It looks like your line of country.
- Thank you, sir.

1196
02:05:37,355 --> 02:05:40,813
Shears, pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can coverJoyce.

1197
02:05:40,891 --> 02:05:44,019
Yai will be with you, so you two
should be able to occupy the Nips...

1198
02:05:44,095 --> 02:05:46,893
if they make any trouble forJoyce.

1199
02:05:46,964 --> 02:05:49,660
On the theory that there's always
one more thing to do...

1200
02:05:49,734 --> 02:05:54,262
I'll set up the mortar here to create
an additional diversion if necessary.

1201
02:05:54,338 --> 02:05:57,432
I might even take a few potshots
at the train.

1202
02:05:57,508 --> 02:05:59,408
All clear?

1203
02:05:59,477 --> 02:06:02,913
Any questions? Right.
We'll start as soon as it's dark.

1204
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:04,447
They're sure to have sentries
on the bridge...

1205
02:06:04,515 --> 02:06:06,983
so you'll have to
float the stuff down...

1206
02:06:07,051 --> 02:06:09,986
from upriver...

1207
02:06:10,054 --> 02:06:12,113
which means building a raft.

1208
02:06:18,129 --> 02:06:20,188
Yai will take three women
to help you build the raft.

1209
02:06:20,264 --> 02:06:23,995
One will stay here with me.
Get cracking.

1210
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:32,576
If it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd takeJoyce's assignment.

1211
02:06:32,643 --> 02:06:34,076
I know.

1212
02:06:34,145 --> 02:06:36,306
Do you think he'll be all right?

1213
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,178
I think so.
Want me to handle it?

1214
02:06:39,250 --> 02:06:41,309
I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if I could.

1215
02:06:41,385 --> 02:06:44,616
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

1216
02:06:44,689 --> 02:06:47,453
When it's over,
I hope you get that medical discharge...

1217
02:06:47,525 --> 02:06:49,493
and not the hard way.

1218
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:50,993
Thanks.

1219
02:07:29,166 --> 02:07:30,599
Load.

1220
02:08:36,233 --> 02:08:40,067
- Beautiful.
- Yes, beautiful.

1221
02:08:40,137 --> 02:08:41,900
A first-rate job.

1222
02:08:41,972 --> 02:08:45,032
I had no idea
it would turn out so well.

1223
02:08:48,379 --> 02:08:52,440
Yes, a beautiful creation.

1224
02:08:53,851 --> 02:08:56,285
I've been thinking.

1225
02:08:56,353 --> 02:09:01,052
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to the day
that I've been in the service.

1226
02:09:01,125 --> 02:09:04,959
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

1227
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:09,363
I don't suppose I've been at home more
than ten months in all that time.

1228
02:09:09,433 --> 02:09:12,095
Still, it's been a good life.

1229
02:09:13,304 --> 02:09:15,272
I love India.

1230
02:09:16,807 --> 02:09:19,298
I wouldn't have had it
any other way.

1231
02:09:20,811 --> 02:09:24,042
But there are times...

1232
02:09:24,114 --> 02:09:28,141
when suddenly you realize you're
nearer the end than the beginning.

1233
02:09:29,587 --> 02:09:32,852
You wonder...

1234
02:09:32,923 --> 02:09:35,619
you ask yourself...

1235
02:09:35,693 --> 02:09:39,993
what the sum total
of your life represents...

1236
02:09:40,064 --> 02:09:44,160
what difference your being there
at any time made to anything...

1237
02:09:44,235 --> 02:09:46,533
or if it made any difference
at all really.

1238
02:09:48,472 --> 02:09:51,873
Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.

1239
02:09:51,942 --> 02:09:55,036
I don't know whether that kind
of thinking is very healthy...

1240
02:09:55,112 --> 02:09:59,208
but I must admit I've had some thoughts
along those lines...

1241
02:09:59,283 --> 02:10:01,274
from time to time.

1242
02:10:04,722 --> 02:10:06,690
But tonight--

1243
02:10:12,329 --> 02:10:13,762
Blast.

1244
02:10:20,938 --> 02:10:22,872
I must be off.

1245
02:10:25,142 --> 02:10:27,508
The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.

1246
02:11:15,526 --> 02:11:16,959
Lovely.

1247
02:13:25,522 --> 02:13:29,390
If you were the only

1248
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:32,224
Girl in the world

1249
02:13:32,296 --> 02:13:37,734
And you were the only boy

1250
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:40,429
Nothing else would matter

1251
02:13:40,504 --> 02:13:43,940
In the world today

1252
02:13:44,007 --> 02:13:46,271
We could go on loving

1253
02:13:46,343 --> 02:13:49,506
In the same old way

1254
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:53,414
A garden of Eden

1255
02:13:53,484 --> 02:13:55,418
Just made for two

1256
02:18:28,925 --> 02:18:31,018
I'm sure I speak for all of us
when I say...

1257
02:18:31,094 --> 02:18:33,858
this has been
an enjoyable evening.

1258
02:18:35,966 --> 02:18:41,370
Most of you move on tomorrow
to a new camp and new construction.

1259
02:18:41,438 --> 02:18:46,137
It's a pity you won't be here to see
the first practical use of the bridge.

1260
02:18:46,209 --> 02:18:49,042
However,
you'll be glad to know...

1261
02:18:49,112 --> 02:18:51,410
the completion of this link
in the railway...

1262
02:18:51,481 --> 02:18:54,917
will enable us to transport
the sick and the disabled...

1263
02:18:54,985 --> 02:18:58,079
to the new camp by train.

1264
02:18:59,856 --> 02:19:02,120
Colonel Saito
has kindly permitted me...

1265
02:19:02,192 --> 02:19:05,593
to stay behind with Major Clipton
and the sick men...

1266
02:19:05,662 --> 02:19:09,120
and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.

1267
02:19:11,068 --> 02:19:14,237
Now that your work here
is finished...

1268
02:19:14,237 --> 02:19:14,703
Now that your work here
is finished...

1269
02:19:14,771 --> 02:19:19,105
I suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.

1270
02:19:19,176 --> 02:19:21,576
That's quite understandable.

1271
02:19:21,645 --> 02:19:23,738
It's a very natural reaction.

1272
02:19:26,016 --> 02:19:30,043
But one day,
in a week, a month, a year...

1273
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:33,988
or that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again...

1274
02:19:34,057 --> 02:19:37,584
you're going to feel very proud...

1275
02:19:37,661 --> 02:19:40,061
of what you have achieved here...

1276
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:43,099
in the face of great adversity.

1277
02:19:44,101 --> 02:19:47,036
What you have done
should be...

1278
02:19:47,104 --> 02:19:49,163
and I think will be...

1279
02:19:49,239 --> 02:19:51,332
an example
to all our countrymen...

1280
02:19:51,408 --> 02:19:55,003
soldier and civilian alike.

1281
02:19:55,078 --> 02:19:57,308
You have survived with honor.

1282
02:19:58,682 --> 02:20:01,879
That and more...

1283
02:20:01,952 --> 02:20:04,477
here in the wilderness.

1284
02:20:04,554 --> 02:20:07,523
You have turned defeat
into victory.

1285
02:20:09,726 --> 02:20:14,254
I congratulate you.
Well done.

1286
02:20:19,736 --> 02:20:21,169
The King.

1287
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:04,927
You're in business.

1288
02:23:05,001 --> 02:23:08,994
You got everything? Stand,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife?

1289
02:23:09,072 --> 02:23:10,699
Yes.

1290
02:23:10,774 --> 02:23:12,708
I'll be directly across the river.

1291
02:23:14,511 --> 02:23:17,674
The professor says there's
always one more thing to do...

1292
02:23:17,747 --> 02:23:21,205
but I can't think
of what it could be...

1293
02:23:21,284 --> 02:23:24,515
except to wish you
a long and happy life.

1294
02:23:24,587 --> 02:23:26,020
Thank you.

1295
02:25:41,624 --> 02:25:43,819
What's happened?

1296
02:25:47,597 --> 02:25:49,966
The river's gone down.

1297
02:26:12,288 --> 02:26:14,586
You can see the wire.

1298
02:26:14,657 --> 02:26:17,285
The charges.

1299
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:26,886
Don't wait for the train.

1300
02:28:26,956 --> 02:28:28,389
Do it now.

1301
02:28:56,152 --> 02:28:57,642
If Saito's information is correct...

1302
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:00,052
the train should be along
in five or ten minutes.

1303
02:29:00,123 --> 02:29:02,990
If you don't mind, sir, I'll watch
the ceremonies from up on the hill.

1304
02:29:03,059 --> 02:29:05,152
Why? You'll get a better view
from the bridge.

1305
02:29:05,228 --> 02:29:08,857
It's hard to explain, sir,
but I'd rather not be a part of it.

1306
02:29:08,931 --> 02:29:10,364
As you please.

1307
02:29:10,433 --> 02:29:13,459
Honestly, sometimes I don't
understand you at all.

1308
02:29:13,536 --> 02:29:17,632
As you once said, sir,
I have a lot to learn about the army.

1309
02:29:24,881 --> 02:29:26,439
Good morning.

1310
02:29:26,516 --> 02:29:28,450
River's gone down in the night.

1311
02:31:12,922 --> 02:31:14,617
What's he doing?

1312
02:32:01,504 --> 02:32:04,803
Colonel,
there's something rather odd going on.

1313
02:32:04,874 --> 02:32:08,310
I think we'd better have another look
around before that train comes across.

1314
02:33:06,736 --> 02:33:08,897
He's gone mad.

1315
02:33:08,971 --> 02:33:11,030
He's leading him right to it.

1316
02:33:11,107 --> 02:33:13,041
Our own man.

1317
02:33:56,752 --> 02:33:59,550
I was right.
There is something going on.

1318
02:34:54,643 --> 02:34:56,736
You have to do it, boy.

1319
02:34:56,812 --> 02:34:58,302
You have to do it now!

1320
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:03,182
Colonel Saito,
have you a knife?

1321
02:35:03,252 --> 02:35:05,311
I just realized
the bridge has been mined.

1322
02:35:05,388 --> 02:35:06,188
'' Mined''?

1323
02:35:06,188 --> 02:35:06,813
'' Mined''?

1324
02:35:13,162 --> 02:35:14,720
Good boy.

1325
02:35:19,835 --> 02:35:22,702
British officer, sir,
here to blow up the bridge.

1326
02:35:22,772 --> 02:35:25,070
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir.

1327
02:35:25,141 --> 02:35:26,836
British commando orders, sir.

1328
02:35:28,344 --> 02:35:30,778
Look out.
There's no time.

1329
02:35:30,846 --> 02:35:32,370
Help!

1330
02:35:39,488 --> 02:35:41,956
Kill him!

1331
02:35:42,024 --> 02:35:44,754
Let me go, sir.
You don't understand, sir.

1332
02:35:45,928 --> 02:35:48,692
Kill him!

1333
02:36:53,762 --> 02:36:55,286
You?

1334
02:36:56,565 --> 02:36:59,135
You!

1335
02:37:11,847 --> 02:37:13,610
What have I done?

1336
02:38:22,151 --> 02:38:23,584
Madness!

1337
02:38:36,565 --> 02:38:38,499
I had to do it.

1338
02:38:40,069 --> 02:38:42,799
They might have been captured alive.

1339
02:38:42,871 --> 02:38:44,498
It was the only thing to do!

1340
02:39:20,876 --> 02:39:22,571
Madness.

1341
02:39:23,305 --> 02:39:29,738
