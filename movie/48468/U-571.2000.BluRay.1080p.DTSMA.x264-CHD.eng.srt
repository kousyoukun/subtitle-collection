<i>Engine room, secure the diesels.</i> <i>Shift propulsion to the battery.</i>

00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,959
Engine room, secure diesels, shift propulsion to the battery.

157
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,990
Main induction indicates shut. <i>Aye.</i>

158
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,626
Green board, Skipper. Very well.

Passing the 100-fathom curve. On course, on time, sir.

160
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,690
Engine room reports secured diesels, propulsion switched to battery.

Very well. All ahead two-thirds. All ahead two-thirds, aye.

162
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:42,956
Mr. Emmett, take her down. Make her depth 1-5-0 feet, ten degree down bubble.

163
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,752
One-five-zero feet, ten degree down bubble. Aye, sir.

164
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:49,086
Chief of the watch, sound the dive alarm. Pass the word to 1 MC.

165
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,692
Open the main ballast tank vents. Aye, sir, passing the word.

166

First time on a submarine?

173
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,290
That's right.

174
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,523
Six-zero feet.

175
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:54,159
<i>[Dahlgren]</i> <i>Lower the scope.</i>

176
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:59,891
Captain, engine room reports minor flooding from shaft seals and brine pump.

177
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:03,526
- <i>Bilge is at 18 inches</i> <i>and rising.</i> - <i>Very well.</i>

178
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:06,859
<i>How deep does</i> <i>this thing go?</i>

179
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:09,924
She'll go all the way to the bottom if we don't stop her.

180
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,685
Normally we try not to get below 150 feet.

181
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,825
Any deeper, the leaks overwhelm the pumps.

182
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,628
<i>These S-boats are antiques,</i>

183
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,657
<i>older than most of the crew.</i>

184
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:24,994
<i>One-zero-zero feet.</i> <i>Aye.</i>

185
00:23:30,763 --> 00:23:32,490
Excuse me, Mr. Emmett.

186
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,556
Put a pipe patch on it, lash it with marline.

187
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:40,923
<i>The yard can fix it</i> <i>when we get back to port.</i> Aye, sir.

188
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:46,628
Relax, gentlemen. She's old, but she'll hold.

189
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,391
<i>Last night, at 0300 hours,</i>

190
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,389
<i>a British destroyer reported</i> <i>depth charging and sinking</i> <i>a German U-boat.</i>

191
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:57,891
However, some time thereafter,

192
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:02,424
Allied direction finding stations triangulated a coded enemy radio signal...

193
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:05,685
to this position here, near the chop line.

194
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:08,587
We believe the U-boat was disabled, not sunk,

195
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:11,454
and is drifting eastward on a four-knot current.

196
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:14,593
<i>Now, French resistance reported</i> <i>a resupply submarine...</i>

197
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,021
sailed from the Lorient U-boat pens yesterday afternoon,

198
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,056
with engine parts and mechanics.

199
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:23,625
We believe it's gonna rendezvous with the disabled U-boat.

200
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:28,319
On board that U-boat is this.

201
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,459
- A typewriter? - An Enigma code machine.

202
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:39,286
It allows the German navy to communicate with its submarines in secret,

203
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:43,494
and our inability to decipher their messages is costing us this war.

204
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:48,423
Mr. Coonan? All right, this is basically a Trojan Horse operation.

205
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:53,320
The S-33 will rendezvous with the U-boat, posing as the German resupply sub.

206
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:57,323
I will lead a boarding party dressed in Kriegsmarine uniforms to the enemy submarine.

207
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,424
<i>We will take it by force</i> <i>and secure the Enigma.</i>

208
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:04,389
Any German survivors will be transferred to the S-33, and the U-boat will be scuttled.

209
00:25:04,663 --> 00:25:07,128
The German resupply submarine will arrive at the rendezvous...

210
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:10,418
and will assume that the U-boat succumbed to its wounds and sank.

211
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,820
The Germans must never suspect we have the Enigma.

212
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:15,721
<i>That is vital.</i> So it's a race?

213
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:18,428
<i>Yes, effectively.</i> Who's the boarding party?

214
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,786
Well, since you're the X.O., you, sir.

215
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,960
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson, Mr. Hirsch and nine of your ship's company.

216
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:27,126
<i>The captain, of course,</i> <i>will remain onboard the S-33.</i>

217
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:33,053
Mr. Coonan, our boys are submarine sailors, not combat Marines.

218
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:35,124
The boys onboard that U-boat are sailors too.

219
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:39,158
Your men'll be ready, Lieutenant. I'll train them myself.

220
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:42,190
You've come to the right boat.

but she was classy, you know?

239
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,493
The type of girl that wants you to take her to a country club dance.

240

<i>Yeah? Like you've ever seen</i> <i>the inside of a country club?</i> <i>Hey!</i>

<i>I tell her about the S-26.</i> <i>Does the trick right away.</i>

Don't be talking about that while we're underway.

246

Why? What happened with the S-26? Yeah, what happened?

She was running a test dive down off Norfolk.

249
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:11,325
Shaft seal failed.

250

<i>She sunk to 400 feet.</i>

251
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:17,856
Know how much water pressure there is that deep?

This is our position, Captain. We're still bucking some pretty heavy seas.

256
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:59,625
I estimate us to be about three hours behind schedule.

257
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,157
I told Mr. Emmett to run at flank speed and hold off a trim dive...

258
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:06,156
until we make up the lost time. That's fine, Lieutenant.

259

You're a first-rate X.O., Andy.

I know you would. I'm not questioning your bravery.

264
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:27,723
The question is: What about their lives?

265
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,089
You and Mr. Emmett are good friends.

266
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:36,260
You went to the Academy together.

267
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:39,358
Would you be willing to sacrifice his life?

268
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:42,458
<i>Or what about</i> <i>some of the younger</i> <i>enlisted men?</i>

269
00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:45,887
You know, a lot of those guys look up to you like a big brother.

270

You willing to lay their lives on the line?

271
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:54,089
You see? You hesitate.

272
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,521
But as a captain, you can't.

273
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:59,657
You have to act.

274
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:02,790
If you don't, you put the entire crew at risk.

275
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:07,459
<i>Now that's the job.</i> <i>It's not a science.</i>

276
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:12,354
<i>You have to be able to make</i> <i>hard decisions, based on</i> <i>imperfect information.</i>

277
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:16,186
<i>Asking men to carry out orders</i> <i>that may result in their deaths.</i>

<i>And if you're wrong,</i> <i>you suffer the consequences.</i>

279
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,325
If you're not prepared to make those decisions...

00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:30,493
without pause, without reflection,

281
00:31:30,828 --> 00:31:33,658
then you've got no business being a submarine captain.

282
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:42,923
<i>Tell Mr. Hirsch</i> <i>I'd like a word with him,</i> <i>would you?</i>

But have a look. Chief.

770
01:23:04,193 --> 01:23:06,125
There is no way a two-knot submarine...

771
01:23:06,426 --> 01:23:10,949
can get in firing position against a 30-knot destroyer unless we go deep.

772
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:13,384
At 160 meters,

773
01:23:13,692 --> 01:23:16,454
we can shoot out a bunch of junk from the forward tubes.

774
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,589
It will resurface and create a debris field.

775
01:23:19,892 --> 01:23:21,881
Now the destroyer's gonna go to the center of that debris field,

776
01:23:22,193 --> 01:23:24,488
shut off its engines to make it real nice and quiet...

777
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,224
and do an acoustic search to make sure we're dead.

778
01:23:27,525 --> 01:23:30,356
But we're not. See, we're here,

779
01:23:30,692 --> 01:23:33,284

<i>All right, principle</i> <i>of ascent velocity.</i>

781
01:23:36,592 --> 01:23:39,490
Our positive buoyancy pulls us up and away from the destroyer.

782
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:42,723
And when we surface, we'll be showing it our ass at 700 yards.
