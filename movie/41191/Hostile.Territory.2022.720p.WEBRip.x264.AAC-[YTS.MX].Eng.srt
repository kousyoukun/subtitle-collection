00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:58,244
<i>By the end of
our nation's great Civil War,</i>

3
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:01,047
<i>thousands of children
found themselves orphaned,</i>

4
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:05,017
<i>their fathers
killed in battle,</i>

5
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:08,586
<i>their mothers taken
by disease, or grief.</i>

6
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,693
<i>Many ended up
on the Orphan Train,</i>

7
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,495
<i>a program to relocate children</i>

8
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,532
<i>from the decimated
northern cities</i>

9
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:22,868
<i>to families
in other territories.</i>

10
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:26,906
<i>Families with love to give.</i>

11
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,474
<i>and farms to run.</i>

12
00:02:34,813 --> 00:02:39,352
<i>My brother, sister and I
rode the Orphan Train,</i>

13
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>cold, hungry, and scared.</i>

14
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,857
<i>Little did we know
at the time</i>

15
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,360
<i>that the only thing
stronger than death</i>

16
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:49,594
<i>was our father's love
for his children.</i>

17
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,302
I'll miss you, Daddy.

18
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:57,669
I'll miss you too.

19
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,209
This is a doll.

20
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:04,844
for both you girls.

21
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,179
that's gonna protect you
while I'm gone.

22
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,282
And anytime you miss Daddy,

23
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,518
you can hold that doll
when you go to sleep at night,

24
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,322
and know that I'm always
thinkin' about you.

25
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,291
Okay?

26
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:21,293
Come here, Lily.

27
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:23,896
Oh, I love you.

28
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,663
<i>When Father
started talking about</i>

29
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:28,100
<i>leaving for the war,</i>

30
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:31,736
<i>our oldest brother, Phillip,
was determined to go with him.</i>

31
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,275
Charlie, you're
the man of the house now.

32
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,745
<i>Father told him
to stay and look after us,</i>

33
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,882
<i>but eventually relented.</i>

34
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,322
- Bye.
- Bye.

35
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:56,262
I'll be home soon.

36
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:55,653
Phillip!

37
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,860
Phillip!

38
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:07,566
Father.

39
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:08,968
Where are you hurt?

40
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,702
I can't feel my legs.

41
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,404
Come on, I got you.

42
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:15,673
Get in the back.

43
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,148
Get him to safety;
get him to safety.

44
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,850
Lieutenant!

45
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,186
Get him down here.

46
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,320
Get him down.

47
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,056
Move down.

48
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,658
They're comin',
they're comin'.

49
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,726
Move in!
There's more of 'em comin',

50
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,995
there's more of 'em comin'.

51
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,463
I'm fine.
I can go back.

52
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:38,631
- No, you're not goin' back.
- I can go back.

53
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:39,797
You can't go back!

54
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,400
- Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:42,667
- I can't leave them, Father.
- Stay with me.

56
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,904
- I love you.
- No! Father, no!

57
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:46,771
- Father, no!
- Stay with me.

58
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,073
- Stay with me.
- No!

59
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,042
Corporal,
stay with me.

60
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:05,783
All aboard!

61
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,857
Thank you.

62
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,560
Let's get
these children on the train.

63
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,462
We leave in five minutes.

64
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,307
<i>Mother got word that
Father had died in battle.</i>

65
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,309
<i>It was like part of her broke.</i>

66
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,113
<i>like she had a hole inside.</i>

67
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:40,986
<i>Before too long, tuberculosis
came and aimed to fill it.</i>

68
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,025
Watch your step.

69
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,116
<i>Riding on that train, though,</i>

70
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,152
<i>we felt a little less lonely.</i>

71
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,589
<i>Next to the rest
of the orphan children,</i>

72
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,525
<i>we considered ourselves lucky.</i>

73
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,295
<i>At least we had each other,</i>

74
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:25,397
<i>least we were still
part of a family.</i>

75
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,942
So, how'd you end up
on this Orphan Train?

76
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:44,116
My father, he didn't
come back from the war.

77
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:48,387
And. and my mother,
she recently died.

78
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:53,926
So, we're gonna live
with my brother, Phil.

79
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,214
Order!

80
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,048
Arms!

81
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:31,530
Manhood comes
sooner for some.

82
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:35,701
Why don't you follow me down
to the Children's Aid Society.

83
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,603
We told them you were alive,

84
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,072
and I think your siblings
should be here soon.

85
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:48,580
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:50,916
Son, you'll be all right.

87
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,019
Carry on.

88
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,489
Thank you.

89
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:59,525
Um-hmm.

90
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:03,562
Corporal, the Army
is movin' your post.

91
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,331
There's a lot of folks
moving out west

92
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:08,066
and they wanna
relocate your post

93
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,369
to one along the Bozeman Trail.

94
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:12,839
Government's gonna
give you land, aid,

95
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:13,772
so you can build a home
on the river

96
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:14,973
just outside of Bozeman.

97
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,809
Hmm.

98
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:17,943
Son, that's a lot
to take in.

99
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,678
You understand what I'm sayin'?

100
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:22,481
I think this could be
a real good start

101
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,082
for you and your family.

102
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:27,152
Yes, sir. I do.
My apologies.

103
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,721
It'll be
a good beginning.

104
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,158
I hope it is.
Thank you.

105
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,798
There's a couple of
angry tribes out there, son.

106
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,468
And I can't blame 'em.

107
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,736
Settlements have moved west
rather quickly

108
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,139
and things have gotten messy.

109
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,309
We need good soldiers
like yourself to.

110
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,477
help bring some peace.

111
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:55,013
Okay.

112
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,689
Just give me a minute
to gather myself.

113
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:13,325
Oh, I...

114
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,726
And then
we can go upstairs.

115
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:15,862
I don't. I don't want
anything from you.

116
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:17,162
I just.

117
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:20,299
Uh, I like to.

118
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:22,467
I'd like to buy this lady
a drink.

119
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:30,309
Are you, uh,
you all right?

120
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:37,115
Yes.

121
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,123
You can come in.

122
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:07,479
Um.

123
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,349
Four years ago, I had to put
my baby on the Orphan Train.

124
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,619
Just wonder what she's like now.

125
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:18,323
I want her bed to be ready
just in case she does come back.

126
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:25,130
We can talk about it if...
if you'd like to.

127
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,768
Ain't no man ever wanted to
stay up all night

128
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:31,670
and talk to me.

129
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,477
What was, uh.
what's your daughter's name?

130
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,548
Gretyl.

131
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,685
I named her after my mother.

132
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,388
I wanted her to have
a better life

133
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:50,722
than I could give her.

134
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:53,525
What will you do
now the war's over?

135
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:59,866
Um. I.

136
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,135
I lost. both my parents.

137
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,938
So, I have to be taking care
of my little siblings now.

138
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:13,512
The Army's relocated me up to
Montana, so.

139
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,547
Your siblings,
what's their names?

140
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,986
So, my younger brother,
his name is Charlie.

141
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,722
And, uh, so proud
of that little guy.

142
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,792
He's.

143
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:30,897
he's gonna be a big man
someday, you know.

144
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,731
Reminds me a lot of my father.

145
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:37,302
And, uh,
gosh. Lizzy.

146
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:38,704
a little ball of fire.

147
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:44,676
And then Lily, kind of afraid
that she won't remember me.

148
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:50,215
And the thing that I can't
stop thinkin' about is

149
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,650
how am I gonna.

150
00:14:53,618 --> 00:15:01,526
how am I gonna break it to them,
you know, Father, he's gone.

151
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,695
And it's just gonna be me.

152
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,299
And how am I gonna be him?

153
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,306
Um, maybe
I could walk you

154
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,375
to the train station
tomorrow, Mister...

155
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,677
what's your name again?

156
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,514
Uh, Phillip.
Phillip Calgrove.

157
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,817
Thank you for just
wanting to talk to me.

158
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:28,653
Yeah. You're welcome.

159
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,300
What's the matter, sweetheart?

160
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,768
I miss my mom and dad.

161
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:51,403
I'm so sorry.

162
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,574
Why does God
let bad things happen?

163
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,045
I don't
have any answer to that,

164
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:00,880
but we have to have faith.

165
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,184
I want you to try to
get some sleep.

166
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,751
It's a long train ride.

167
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,421
My mom
would always sing me to sleep.

168
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:20,933
<i>♪ O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder ♪</i>

169
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:26,906
<i>♪ Consider all the works
Thy Hands hath made ♪</i>

170
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,913
<i>♪ I see the stars
I hear the roaring thunder ♪</i>

171
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:40,719
<i>♪ Thy powers throughout
The universe displayed ♪</i>

172
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:47,159
<i>♪ Then sings my soul,
My Savior God to Thee ♪</i>

173
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:51,197
<i>♪ How great Thou art ♪</i>

174
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,467
<i>♪ How great Thou art ♪</i>

175
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:12,051
Come on. Get up.

176
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:13,085
War's over.

177
00:18:36,976 --> 00:18:40,478
Move, boy!

178
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:56,829
Keep walkin'.

179
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:07,505
Come on.

180
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,210
Go on, get.

181
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,081
Keep walkin', Desmond.

182
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:17,049
Keep walking. Go.

183
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:20,618
Don't look back.

184
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,376
Come on, Desmond.

185
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,671
Whoa.

186
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,208
Jack Calgrove.

187
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:18,944
Samuel Hagan.

188
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,981
Boys look like you had it rough.

189
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:23,949
Yeah.

190
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,387
Desmond Richards.

191
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,889
Samuel Hagan.

192
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:35,261
I got these horses here.

193
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:38,898
Strays I picked up
off the battlefield.

194
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,698
How you boys gettin' home?

195
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,115
Molly!

196
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:01,353
Charlie!

197
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,125
I'm home!

198
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,029
Molly?

199
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:13,899
Nobody's home.

200
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,800
Everything all right,
Mr. Calgrove?

201
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,073
Molly!

202
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:39,859
Whoa, whoa.

203
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,973
Molly.

204
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:04,682
They think I'm dead.

205
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:13,959
I gotta find my children.

206
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,034
Gentlemen,
allow me to welcome you home

207
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,270
on behalf of our great nation,

208
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:28,773
and know that
while you have lost comrades,

209
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:33,245
brothers, and friends,
that it was not in vain.

210
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:37,249
That your nation thanks you.

211
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,155
Well, I'll be damned.

212
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:49,428
Company, present arms!

213
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,806
Several days after
Molly had heard of your death,

214
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,808
she passed, Jack.

215
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,247
Tuberculosis.

216
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:12,284
I'm sorry.

217
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:16,488
Molly's wish was
that the young ones

218
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:19,824
be sent to live with
your son Phillip in Missouri.

219
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,230
Phil is still alive?

220
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:27,900
Yes.

221
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,734
Thank you, God.

222
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:34,440
Who's been tendin' to Charlie,

223
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:35,941
Lizzy, and Lily?

224
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:39,078
The Army contacted
an orphanage in New York.

225
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:42,181
A gentleman by the name
of Edward Pagan.

226
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:45,484
He's doin' many fine works,

227
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:47,453
placing children
with good homes.

228
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:49,355
The Orphan Train movement.

229
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,958
You mean to tell me,

230
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:56,228
you put my children
in an orphanage?

231
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:59,565
Jack, when I found out
Phillip was still alive,

232
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:02,800
I needed to get those children
to Missouri to meet him.

233
00:24:02,935 --> 00:24:05,037
There's 50 kids on that train.

234
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,505
It seemed to me to be

235
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:09,275
the most reasonable option
to transport them.

236
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,709
Oh, help me God.

237
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:14,513
You put my kids on a train,
you sent them to Missouri?

238
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:17,650
You realize how dangerous
that is?!

239
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:20,286
That's hostile territory!

240
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,021
We just finished
fightin' the war

241
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:24,056
right where
that train's goin'!

242
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,191
Are there armed officers
on that train?

243
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,260
Yes, Jack.

244
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:30,696
The government has ordered
that Company K

245
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:34,366
ride with the Orphan Trains
to guard them against

246
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,268
hostile Confederates
and Natives.

247
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:39,371
Company K's a group
of sharpshootin' Natives

248
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,773
from Michigan.

249
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,274
I was in the 54th Regiment

250
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:44,677
and I did some work
with Company K.

251
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,581
Jack, I can send
a message through Company K

252
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:54,420
alerting your son Phillip
that you're still alive.

253
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:57,089
I reckon you point me
in the direction of that train.

254
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:07,800
God bless your soul.

255
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:25,117
All packed up.

256
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:29,121
You know you don't
have to go with me.

257
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:30,856
You might enjoy
some peace and quiet.

258
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,391
Yeah.

259
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,626
I ain't got nowhere else
I got to be.

260
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:39,198
And I want to help you
get your family back.

261
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,469
You're a good man.

262
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:44,470
Let's get on the trail.

263
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:58,250
Let's ride.

264
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:12,791
Charlie, I'm hungry.

265
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:15,160
Okay, um,
wait right here.

266
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:22,134
Um, excuse me.
Would it be okay

267
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,770
if I get a few more
pieces of bread and water?

268
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,338
Yes, dear. Um.

269
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,806
I'll go ahead and distribute
the bread to everyone.

270
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,141
Thank you.

271
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:34,813
What happened to you?

272
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:36,615
Mom not want you anymore?

273
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:38,952
Or she just work at
one of them whorehouses?

274
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,627
Here,
you come sit with us.

275
00:27:50,897 --> 00:27:52,631
- Charlie, you good?
- Yeah.

276
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:04,510
Some bread for you.

277
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,345
Thank you.

278
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:10,382
Here.

279
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,887
Good morning to you all!

280
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,488
Good morning.

281
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:52,224
Beautiful day
for some new families.

282
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:57,629
Fathers mothers, brothers,
and sisters.

283
00:28:57,763 --> 00:28:59,731
thank you for comin'.

284
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,935
We've arrived
in Independence, Missouri,

285
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:03,702
and you're all about to go home.

286
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,637
Please stay seated
for right now,

287
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,739
and Mr. Smith will be right on
to tell you where to go next.

288
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,808
You'll have to
fill out the paperwork

289
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,143
for this gentleman.

290
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:12,979
It's required by law.

291
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:15,280
Those of you who've already
filled out the paperwork

292
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:18,183
can just step to the front
of the line over there.

293
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:19,886
We'll bring out the children.

294
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,020
I need some strong boys
for helping me.

295
00:29:21,153 --> 00:29:22,287
It's gonna be okay.

296
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:23,422
Oh, we got
strong ones and...

297
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,924
and strong girls too.

298
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,358
Do they have names?

299
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,160
Oh yeah,
they all have names.

300
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:41,406
Everyone,
get off the train.

301
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:52,852
Follow me
and we'll form a line.

302
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,122
Watch your step.

303
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:00,192
Step right down.

304
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,426
There you go.

305
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,131
There you go, Jimmy.

306
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,166
There we go.

307
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,036
Please form a line
at the stand.

308
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:12,839
There we go, little one.

309
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:14,239
Got it, young lady?

310
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,707
There you go.

311
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:16,708
Phil!

312
00:30:16,843 --> 00:30:18,210
Lizzy!

313
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,511
Phil!

314
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,647
It's okay.

315
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:23,782
Watch your step.

316
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,453
Hey, buddy.

317
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,823
Oh, my gosh.
Look how big you've grown.

318
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,860
Dang.

319
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:38,330
Hey. Hey, uh, Lily, I...
I know you may not remember me.

320
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,299
Uh, but I'm your older brother,
Phil.

321
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,002
I'm gonna take care of you.
Okay?

322
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,470
She hasn't talked
since Mother and Father died.

323
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,242
Okay.

324
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,543
That's all your stuff
right there?

325
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,245
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll get that...

326
00:30:53,378 --> 00:30:55,213
Sir, you will need, uh, to
fill out the proper paperwork.

327
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,150
Okay. All right,
you guys get in line.

328
00:30:57,282 --> 00:30:58,183
I'll be right back.

329
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,518
Okay.

330
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,227
Ingrid?

331
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:12,065
All right, parents,
step up to the front.

332
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:13,665
We'll need your paperwork.

333
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,168
Come on up.
Come on up.

334
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,169
Don't be afraid.

335
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:18,203
Thank you.

336
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,911
This way, please.

337
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:38,490
Uh-uh.

338
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,028
Step this way.

339
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,295
Thank you.

340
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:44,529
Thank you, sir.

341
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,432
This way, please.

342
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:50,302
Paperwork looks good to me.

343
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:51,636
Next group.

344
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,239
What's your name?

345
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:55,540
Emily.

346
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,077
Hi, Emily.
Welcome to our family.

347
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:00,146
Next.

348
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:02,547
In our house,
you earn your keep.

349
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,984
You work hard, get rewarded
with a good supper.

350
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:07,920
If you don't work hard,
you hit the road.

351
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:10,355
In this house, I'm the law.
That understood?

352
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:11,790
Yes, sir.

353
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:12,925
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,793
All right. Come on.

355
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,863
Come on down this way.
Right around.

356
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,297
Come on now. Come on.

357
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:26,738
For Charlie, Lizzy,
and Lily Calgrove, please.

358
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:29,775
That's my brother, Phil.

359
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:33,545
Phil, can we take Mary with us?

360
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:35,181
I'm so...
I'm sorry, children.

361
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:38,918
I have, uh, Addison, Mary,
Johnny, Ray and Jacob down

362
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:41,954
as all getting adopted
by the Smith family and they...

363
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:43,555
they've not shown up yet.

364
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:47,093
If they don't show up
by tomorrow morning,

365
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:48,660
you'll go back on the train.

366
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:50,897
But... but tonight you'll sleep
in the local orphanage.

367
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,000
Wait, what about Jimmy?

368
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:57,536
Uh. well, the family
didn't take Jimmy.

369
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:01,773
Uh, lots of times, they don't
take the older children.

370
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:06,645
Bye.

371
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,480
My dad gave me this doll.

372
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,049
I'd like you to have it.

373
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,685
Bye.

374
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:17,857
All right, uh,
Lily, Lizzy, Charlie,

375
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,159
it's time to get goin'.

376
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:24,096
Here. I got this for ya.

377
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,564
Go on, sweetheart.

378
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,667
Bye.

379
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:37,944
You're one brave cowboy.

380
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:41,314
And sometimes, cowboys have to
part ways to their cattle.

381
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:48,753
All right, bud.

382
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,330
I beg you,
please help me.

383
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:32,832
My daughter has been taken.

384
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,400
Please.

385
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,004
You lost?

386
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,940
Ain't much around here but men
returnin' home from the war.

387
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:46,745
And for a Black woman,
it ain't a safe place to be.

388
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,889
There's a town.

389
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:00,659
about 25 miles back
the way we came.

390
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:07,532
- Thank you.
- I'm sure there's someone

391
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:08,767
there can help you.

392
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,818
Keep the guns down.

393
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:29,688
Looks like we got a couple of
no-good Yanks.

394
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:31,456
Yankees.

395
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,394
War's over.
You guys keep on movin'.

396
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:37,063
Over when we say it's over.

397
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:39,432
How 'bout I just rip you
off that horse?

398
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:46,738
Keep goin'.

399
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,148
We gotta keep moving.

400
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:58,550
I want to rip their throats out
just as bad as you do.

401
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,851
One more step, she's done!

402
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:36,055
She's done!

403
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:41,626
One more step...!

404
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,073
Come with us.

405
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:10,523
Your daughter.

406
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:14,759
was in an alley living
out of a cardboard box.

407
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,229
You gave us no choice
but to remove her.

408
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,901
Don't you tell me that!

409
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:26,771
You don't know what I've
been through to find freedom!

410
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:30,242
Now to have my child
ripped away!

411
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,146
You tell me what
my child is right now!

412
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,548
Right now!

413
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:39,784
Please, I beg you, sir.

414
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,820
I beg you, please.
She ain't ever been without me.

415
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:43,456
I'm a good mother. I promise,
I'm a good mother.

416
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:46,392
I promise.

417
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,227
I'm a good mom.

418
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:54,732
Forgive me.

419
00:37:56,302 --> 00:37:57,536
Now, let's see
what we can do for you.

420
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,976
Looks like Mary is on a train
heading to Missouri

421
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,810
with about 40 other children.

422
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:12,017
She will be at the orphanage,
in good care.

423
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,999
You sure your daughter's
on that Orphan Train?

424
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:46,886
I lost two years of my life
in those Confederate camps.

425
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:52,424
My babies' voices echoed
through my head every day.

426
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,197
It's what kept me from dyin'.

427
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,171
How old is your daughter?

428
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,740
She's 10.

429
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:10,675
You said her name was?

430
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:11,776
- Mary.
- Mary?

431
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,212
Mary Beggs.

432
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:14,947
Mary.

433
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,198
Where are you
headed off to?

434
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,269
Told you that you can't
get emotionally involved

435
00:39:37,403 --> 00:39:39,737
with these men
who come in here.

436
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:41,739
They aren't safe.

437
00:39:54,486 --> 00:39:55,921
I never wanted this life.

438
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:58,357
Do you think
any of us want this life?

439
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,229
I hate myself for bringing you
here with me and Jimmy.

440
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:07,633
When he died, I thought
I could work here

441
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:10,202
until I found another man or...

442
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:14,006
or got me an honest job
to take care of you.

443
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:19,044
I never intended to drag you
into this dark hole with me.

444
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:21,547
We can leave
in the morning.

445
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,015
And never look back.

446
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,151
I met an honest soldier.

447
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,553
He ain't your normal man.
He just wanted to talk to me.

448
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,588
Ingrid, you little fool.

449
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,090
Where do you think
this honest man

450
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:33,192
is goin' to take you?

451
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,593
What do you think
is gonna happen?

452
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:35,861
I'm leaving!

453
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,066
I would rather die
a gruesome death

454
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,903
than spend one more night here
havin' a man touch me.

455
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,774
I remember
when we was little girls.

456
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:53,445
We used to run through
the sunflower fields

457
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,180
in North Carolina.

458
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:58,984
You used to tell me
that dreams are from God.

459
00:41:00,552 --> 00:41:04,822
And that when you stop dreaming,
you stop living.

460
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:09,361
Sarah, we aren't living.

461
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:14,799
Dreams aren't real.

462
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:17,903
I ain't too sure God is real.

463
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:22,308
But I ain't goin' to stop you
from leavin' here.

464
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:56,542
There you go.

465
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,177
Lily, this is yours.

466
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,645
- And Charlie.
- Thank you.

467
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,547
- There you go.
- Ooo, muffins are my favorite.

468
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,918
And last, but certainly
not least, Miss Lizzy.

469
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,786
Thank you.

470
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,621
You're welcome.

471
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:17,629
So, I got some news. The Army
is relocating me up to Montana.

472
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:21,300
That means that we're going to
be leaving tomorrow morning.

473
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:24,670
I think it will be
a good start for all of us.

474
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,138
What will we do up there?

475
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:28,474
The Army has given me
some land by a river.

476
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,409
And, um.

477
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,244
I plan on turning it
into a farm.

478
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:34,747
So, we'll be raising crops,
and we'll have horses

479
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,582
and we'll have sheep and cattle.

480
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:38,183
And there's even a town.

481
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:39,885
And in that town,
there's a little school

482
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,320
that I'll take you all to.

483
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:43,288
Oh, can I fish
on the river?

484
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:44,923
I used to love fishing
with Father.

485
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:46,492
You can fish all you want.

486
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,862
Yeah. As a family.

487
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:50,830
Yeah.
But I caught the most fish.

488
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:03,008
Did you see Father die?

489
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:09,648
No.

490
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:22,194
Hi.

491
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:24,163
Uh, hi.

492
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:26,165
Uh, come in, come in.

493
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,669
Hi. I'm Lizzy.

494
00:43:30,803 --> 00:43:33,572
Hello, Lizzy.
Nice to meet you. I'm Ingrid.

495
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:34,606
Hi, Charlie.

496
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,707
Hello, Lily.

497
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:40,646
Um, here. Let me give you
somethin' to eat.

498
00:43:43,482 --> 00:43:45,250
The three of you
sure look alike.

499
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:47,686
Uh, Charlie,
Lily, and Lizzy, uh,

500
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,155
Ingrid is a. a friend of mine.

501
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:57,362
Um.
Can I come with you to Montana?

502
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:59,798
I won't be any trouble.
I just.

503
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,433
I want a better life.

504
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:06,071
I think it would be
nice for her to come with us.

505
00:44:07,673 --> 00:44:13,111
Yeah. Um, I...
I suppose, yeah.

506
00:44:14,513 --> 00:44:15,581
Thank you.

507
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:17,483
Ingrid, do you think
you can talk Phil

508
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:21,053
into letting our friends
come with us to Montana?

509
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,654
I don't think
they have any homes.

510
00:44:22,788 --> 00:44:24,790
Um, they made friends
with other children

511
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:26,291
on the Orphan Train,

512
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:30,162
and they didn't get
adopted this morning.

513
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:31,663
But you know what?

514
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:33,465
I know you had a long day
today on the trains.

515
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,000
And we're gonna have
a very long day tomorrow,

516
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,702
'cause if we're
gonna be traveling,

517
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:38,270
we're gonna have to pack up.

518
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,506
So, I think it's time
for you guys to get to bed.

519
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,008
I can make a pallet
for them by the fireplace.

520
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,409
- Oh.
- Lizzy and Lily,

521
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:45,879
how about I braid your hair
before bed?

522
00:44:46,011 --> 00:44:47,412
- Okay.
- Yeah.

523
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:49,147
Okay.

524
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

525
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:19,171
Go, go, go, go.

526
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:40,359
Jack,
there're too many!

527
00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:52,638
Jack,
there's Company K!

528
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:09,922
Thanks for the help,
soldier.

529
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:18,764
Let's move out.

530
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,036
There may be more comin'.

531
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:24,269
Come on.

532
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,851
We've been tracking
these Apaches for a while now.

533
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:39,952
Lieutenant Calgrove.

534
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:41,154
Shantu.

535
00:47:41,286 --> 00:47:43,522
United States Army, Company K.

536
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,691
Ah, you're the Native Union
sharpshooting group.

537
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,359
Yes, sir.

538
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,861
Wait a minute.

539
00:47:48,995 --> 00:47:50,930
Calgrove.

540
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:52,731
The letter, please.

541
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:54,033
What letter?

542
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,434
You're the father
coming for his children.

543
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:56,836
Here's a letter
we're delivering

544
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:58,637
to the station
in Independence, Missouri.

545
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,372
But why didn't it
get there?

546
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:02,240
We guard
these Orphan Trains at night.

547
00:48:02,374 --> 00:48:03,809
We'll pull over
to pick on those Apaches

548
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:05,310
you just encountered.

549
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:07,880
And it took us far off track.

550
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:11,616
My son, Phillip Calgrove,
lives in Independence, Missouri.

551
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,452
That's where he's stationed.

552
00:48:13,585 --> 00:48:15,253
They're supposed to be
holding them with him there.

553
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:16,621
How far is it?

554
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:18,724
It's about
a hundred miles from here.

555
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:19,758
Let's move.

556
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,245
The kids are still sleeping.

557
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:41,413
Mornin'.

558
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:45,885
All, uh, all loaded up now.

559
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:52,758
Is everything okay?

560
00:49:14,713 --> 00:49:16,581
We don't.
we don't know each other,

561
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:20,385
but what I do know is
we seem to be

562
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,788
in the same place
in our lives.

563
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,492
We're both searching
for a greater purpose.

564
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:37,702
I just.

565
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:41,473
I just can't walk in there
and adopt six children.

566
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,480
I can barely
take care of myself.

567
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:54,887
I had stopped
believing in goodness.

568
00:49:56,454 --> 00:49:57,924
Until the night we met.

569
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:03,896
From that night on, I.

570
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:07,867
I started thinking maybe
there's another way for me.

571
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:14,706
Maybe with these children,
I.

572
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:20,445
I could be worth something.

573
00:50:23,682 --> 00:50:24,951
I can help you.

574
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:30,923
We can do it.

575
00:50:55,814 --> 00:50:57,917
Mary, Addi,
Johnny, Jacob, Ray, Jimmy,

576
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,551
get out here!

577
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:01,820
Get out here!

578
00:51:03,189 --> 00:51:04,090
Lizzy!

579
00:51:05,457 --> 00:51:07,559
I miss you.

580
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:10,229
- Jacob.
- I miss you so much.

581
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:11,463
Jimmy!

582
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,968
Well.

583
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:18,838
your brother already
sendin' you back, huh?

584
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:20,072
No, sir.

585
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:22,241
We would like to take
our friends with us.

586
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,344
I'd, uh, like to formally
adopt all these children

587
00:51:25,477 --> 00:51:26,312
that were left behind.

588
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:27,445
You serious, sir?

589
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:28,480
Dead serious.

590
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:30,917
Whoo!

591
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,986
We could use your help on
the farm from all of you guys.

592
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,390
Well, you'll all be glad

593
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:39,892
to have a family again, right?

594
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:41,626
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,896
I'll get the paperwork
and you can be on your way.

596
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,998
- Okay, thank you.
- All of ya.

597
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:47,599
Thank you.

598
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,168
Ray, welcome to the family.

599
00:51:49,302 --> 00:51:50,970
I'm Phil.

600
00:51:51,103 --> 00:51:52,939
- What's your name?
- Mary.

601
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:53,940
I'm Phil.

602
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,011
Goodbye, Frank.

603
00:51:59,145 --> 00:52:00,413
I'll miss you, Ray.

604
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:01,746
I'll miss you too.

605
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:04,449
Goodbye, Jimmy.

606
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:08,421
Good luck to ya.

607
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:09,487
Hope to see you again.

608
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,722
Thank you.

609
00:52:11,623 --> 00:52:12,724
God bless.

610
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,660
All right, everyone.

611
00:52:27,672 --> 00:52:30,943
<i>We met up with
another family leaving town,</i>

612
00:52:31,077 --> 00:52:34,546
<i>and together, we set out
to start our lives over.</i>

613
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:44,957
<i>Huddled in the back
of those wagons,</i>

614
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:47,792
<i>we were ready
to take on the world.</i>

615
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:04,343
Charlie, why don't you
get up here

616
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:05,211
and show 'em how it's done.

617
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:12,351
- Right over there.
- Okay.

618
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:13,718
On your sights.

619
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:15,054
Sit back, everybody.

620
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:19,358
Ooh.

621
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:20,960
Dang, Charlie.

622
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:23,362
- Yeah, Charlie.
- Bull's eye, buddy.

623
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:25,297
Doesn't surprise me
at all, buddy.

624
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:27,366
Who's next?

625
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,401
Can I go next?

626
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:29,634
Yeah, get up here.

627
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,103
All right,
just like your brother,

628
00:53:31,237 --> 00:53:33,005
right at those tin cans
I set up.

629
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:34,073
Okay.

630
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,143
Now, it's a little loud,
so I'm gonna cover your ears.

631
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:39,945
All right.
Line up a little bit.

632
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,579
You got it?

633
00:53:42,747 --> 00:53:44,383
Ooh.

634
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:45,518
Nice shooting, cowgirl.

635
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,718
Thanks.

636
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,521
Dang, Lizzy,
you can shoot.

637
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:50,622
I'll go. That's easy.

638
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:52,757
Hit that one right there.

639
00:53:52,892 --> 00:53:54,160
Here you go.

640
00:53:54,293 --> 00:53:56,929
Now just like the other two,
line it up.

641
00:53:57,063 --> 00:53:58,297
Now let her rip
when you're ready.

642
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:00,665
Which one of these
is the trigger?

643
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:02,201
- Whoa.
- Hey.

644
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:04,837
All right, so first
rule of handling a gun is,

645
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,839
you never aim
at another person.

646
00:54:06,972 --> 00:54:08,374
Only if
it's the bad guy, though.

647
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,608
Thank you, Charlie.
Only if it's the bad guy.

648
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:12,111
Children,
supper's ready.

649
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:14,013
All right,
we'll do this later.

650
00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:15,147
Come on, Jimmy.

651
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:21,454
<i>As we traveled West,</i>

652
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:23,721
<i>our hearts began to heal</i>

653
00:54:23,856 --> 00:54:26,258
<i>from the wound
of losing our parents.</i>

654
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:32,797
<i>We let go of our
fear and anger.</i>

655
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:35,000
<i>Love re-entered our lives.</i>

656
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:25,650
Corporal.

657
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,052
Welcome to
Missouri, Lieutenant.

658
00:55:27,186 --> 00:55:28,487
Looking for
the local orphanage.

659
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,256
Can you point us
in that direction?

660
00:55:30,389 --> 00:55:32,558
Down that way
at the edge of town.

661
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,791
Thank you.

662
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:41,267
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

663
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,510
I'm here for my children.

664
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:53,145
Oh, yes, sir.

665
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:56,081
Well, I will need for you
to fill out the necessary...

666
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:58,284
I don't think you understand!

667
00:55:58,417 --> 00:56:00,419
My children arrived here
a few days ago.

668
00:56:00,553 --> 00:56:01,620
Phillip Calgrove.

669
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:03,222
Phillip Calgrove, yes.

670
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:04,523
A... And the children.

671
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:06,091
They're... they're with him.

672
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:07,526
Where the hell are they?

673
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,994
They're...
they're on a wagon train

674
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:10,462
on the way to the Oregon Trail.

675
00:56:10,596 --> 00:56:11,931
- It's West.
- Tell me! You got a map?

676
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:13,265
You got a map in here?

677
00:56:13,399 --> 00:56:14,967
I have many maps. I.

678
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,435
I'm sure you can find it.

679
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:24,310
Was there a child named
Mary Beggs with them?

680
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:27,779
Mary Beggs, Mary Beggs.

681
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:29,448
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.

682
00:56:29,582 --> 00:56:31,417
You cannot travel that alone.

683
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:32,651
You know the route?

684
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:33,718
Sure do.

685
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,054
We'll all ride together.

686
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:36,754
Mary's, yes, yes, yes,
she's with them.

687
00:56:36,889 --> 00:56:38,257
Yes, yes. I remember Mary.

688
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,291
She's with them.

689
00:56:39,425 --> 00:56:40,626
You'll need this paper.

690
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:41,860
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

691
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:43,229
- Thank you.
- Yes.

692
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:48,367
Phil's been assigned
to a new post.

693
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,202
Someone must have
given the order.

694
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:54,473
<i>Looks like you folks
left one war,</i>

695
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:55,841
jumped right into another one.

696
00:56:55,975 --> 00:56:57,209
Where are they?

697
00:56:58,277 --> 00:56:59,311
Here.

698
00:56:59,445 --> 00:57:01,146
Bozeman, Montana.

699
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,082
See, a lot of these tribes
were forced West,

700
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:06,685
and they had their land
seized by the government.

701
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:11,023
They blamed the settlers and
started raiding the whole area.

702
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:12,958
We had to station men
at different posts

703
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:14,792
to help keep the peace.

704
00:57:14,927 --> 00:57:16,328
Are the children
in danger?

705
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:21,300
Well, the Cheyenne
have been causing

706
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:22,468
most of the trouble.

707
00:58:15,654 --> 00:58:16,821
Charlie, get the girls.

708
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:23,329
Come on, come on.

709
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:24,196
This way.

710
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,131
Come on, come on you guys.

711
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:18,317
We don't want any trouble.

712
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,018
We're just passing through.

713
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:24,356
On our way to
Montana to farm.

714
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:27,926
Here, come,
break bread with us.

715
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:28,961
Hmm.

716
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:31,029
Okay, yeah. Okay.

717
00:59:31,163 --> 00:59:33,999
Guys, let's break bread.

718
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:35,267
It'll be okay.

719
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,310
No!

720
00:59:49,948 --> 00:59:51,049
Get down.

721
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:54,119
Please, please no more.

722
00:59:56,755 --> 00:59:58,490
Please, please.

723
00:59:58,624 --> 00:59:59,525
Please, enough.

724
01:00:00,894 --> 01:00:02,060
Stop!

725
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:03,830
No!

726
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:07,266
Please, please, no more.

727
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:09,067
They're just children.

728
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:10,602
They're children, no!

729
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,210
No!

730
01:00:24,616 --> 01:00:25,584
No!

731
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:28,320
Charlie, no!

732
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:36,562
Charlie!

733
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,072
Charlie, no!

734
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:27,446
Here.

735
01:01:36,221 --> 01:01:37,389
He's gone.

736
01:01:39,926 --> 01:01:41,026
These children.

737
01:01:46,231 --> 01:01:47,332
She's dead.

738
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,402
Please, no.

739
01:01:51,537 --> 01:01:52,471
Oh no.

740
01:01:53,472 --> 01:01:58,845
No. Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie.

741
01:01:58,978 --> 01:02:00,245
Charlie's still breathing.

742
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:05,417
Come here, I got you.

743
01:02:05,551 --> 01:02:08,487
I got you, I got you.

744
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:11,256
I got you.

745
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:12,992
Daddy, it hurts.

746
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,531
I tried to protect them.

747
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:22,634
You did so good, Charlie.

748
01:02:22,768 --> 01:02:23,769
You did so good.

749
01:02:23,903 --> 01:02:25,470
Don't you go.

750
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,779
Don't you go.

751
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:35,113
Please stay.

752
01:02:36,782 --> 01:02:38,784
You're my boy.

753
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:39,886
You're my boy, Charlie.

754
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:41,453
Don't go.

755
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:47,392
I got you.

756
01:02:47,526 --> 01:02:51,096
Daddy's here, Daddy's here.

757
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:56,869
Please God,
please don't take him.

758
01:02:57,003 --> 01:02:58,170
Don't take him.

759
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,638
Don't take him.

760
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:03,775
No!

761
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:12,711
Every night.

762
01:04:15,414 --> 01:04:16,983
we'd sit around the table.

763
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:22,554
She'd read a Bible
verse out of this Bible.

764
01:04:22,688 --> 01:04:25,390
We'd take turns
sayin' the nightly prayer.

765
01:04:28,694 --> 01:04:29,628
Char.

766
01:04:33,066 --> 01:04:38,603
Charlie was always the first
to say the same prayer.

767
01:04:43,076 --> 01:04:46,846
He became a man
the day I left.

768
01:04:49,314 --> 01:04:50,749
And died an innocent.

769
01:04:55,554 --> 01:04:57,990
I know if they shot him.

770
01:05:01,326 --> 01:05:02,828
he was trying to save somebody.

771
01:05:13,106 --> 01:05:14,306
My husband Charles and I

772
01:05:14,439 --> 01:05:18,510
planned to escape
the plantation.

773
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:22,915
Mary was a baby.

774
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:29,621
And we wanted to give her
a better life.

775
01:05:31,757 --> 01:05:34,392
We almost got
off that plantation

776
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:36,028
when we got noticed.

777
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,736
Charles told me, "You run,
and you don't look back."

778
01:05:49,108 --> 01:05:51,510
Well, I circled back and.

779
01:05:55,148 --> 01:05:57,582
they hammered him to a cross.

780
01:06:00,285 --> 01:06:06,625
and set him on fire
right in front of my eyes.

781
01:06:23,341 --> 01:06:27,280
It doesn't seem fair
what some have to go through

782
01:06:27,412 --> 01:06:28,881
on this side of life.

783
01:06:33,286 --> 01:06:34,452
I'm sorry.

784
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:49,601
Thank you.

785
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,344
I'm gonna find
your daughter, Miss Beggs.

786
01:07:02,315 --> 01:07:04,050
I'm gonna get my children back.

787
01:07:06,484 --> 01:07:07,954
Nothin's gonna stop me.

788
01:07:09,222 --> 01:07:10,355
Nothin'.

789
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:21,834
Just give me a minute.

790
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,522
I'm gonna miss you, son.

791
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:16,454
<i>Father, don't go.</i>

792
01:08:23,963 --> 01:08:24,864
Oh, Lily.

793
01:08:25,932 --> 01:08:29,634
I promise you;
I'll be home soon.

794
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:42,415
How do you reckon
we find them?

795
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:44,250
We'll lure them to us.

796
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:45,817
Yes.

797
01:08:45,952 --> 01:08:48,687
They'll be back for the next
wagon train passing by.

798
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,889
Just a matter of time.

799
01:08:54,492 --> 01:08:56,128
Let's get ready.

800
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,122
Take your time.

801
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:24,589
Don't be nervous.

802
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:09,727
Keep calm.

803
01:11:09,862 --> 01:11:11,097
It's gonna be okay.

804
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:13,665
It's okay.

805
01:11:37,456 --> 01:11:39,024
Phil. Phil.

806
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:56,808
Tell me.

807
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:58,676
Is that where my children are?

808
01:12:14,759 --> 01:12:16,862
Did you kill my son?!

809
01:12:16,996 --> 01:12:19,731
Did you kill my son?!

810
01:12:48,427 --> 01:12:49,929
How many men
inside your camp?

811
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:53,532
Many.

812
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:54,667
Many men.

813
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,238
All right,
you're gonna lead us there.

814
01:14:38,637 --> 01:14:40,172
Shantu, take your men.

815
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:41,974
You guys drop down the ridge.

816
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,242
I'll meet you in the middle.

817
01:15:36,362 --> 01:15:37,663
[Ingrid No! Get off of her.

818
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:40,466
No, get off of her.

819
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:05,057
No. Get back, get back.

820
01:16:10,996 --> 01:16:12,564
Move back
that way, that way.

821
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:19,505
Lily!

822
01:16:27,346 --> 01:16:28,580
- Where'd they go?
- They ran that way.

Get up. Get up, come on.

827
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:05,451

828
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:10,355
Are you okay?

829
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:12,524
- I'm sorry.

830
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,431
Watch it.
Go get the kids.

831
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:20,732
- Get the kids.
- Get her to safety.

832
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:21,967
Where's the girls?

833
01:17:34,881 --> 01:17:35,981
Whoa,

Daddy! Daddy!

836
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:35,173
Lizzy, where's your sister?

837
01:18:35,307 --> 01:18:36,575
They took her.
They took her.

838
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,210
- Where? Where?
- Under the bridge.

839
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:41,948
Okay.

840
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,215
Here's my pistol.

841
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:45,852
If anybody
comes near you, shoot.

842
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:47,753
Okay?

843
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:49,022
Okay.

844
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:13,111
Yah! Yah! Yah!

845
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,276
Oh, Lily.

849
01:20:03,963 --> 01:20:04,897
Lily!

850
01:20:17,809 --> 01:20:19,144
There you go.

851
01:20:22,949 --> 01:20:24,316
Alice.

852
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,425
Mary?

853
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,029
Mary!

854
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:37,696
- Mary. Mary.

855
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:39,231
Mary!

856
01:20:39,364 --> 01:20:40,699
Oh my God.

857
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:52,011
Let me look at you.

858
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:54,113
Oh, you okay?

859
01:20:54,246 --> 01:20:55,514
Huh?

860
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:57,816
I missed you so much.

861
01:21:05,892 --> 01:21:08,895
I hope you've
made peace with God.

862
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:13,231
You killed my son,
and I'm gonna make sure

863
01:21:13,365 --> 01:21:16,035
every single one of you
pay the price.

864
01:21:16,169 --> 01:21:17,269
Jack.

865
01:21:19,237 --> 01:21:20,372
Please stop.

866
01:22:11,023 --> 01:22:11,924
Thank you.

867
01:22:17,496 --> 01:22:19,264
We want peace as well.

868
01:22:23,268 --> 01:22:25,270
Raise!

869
01:22:25,403 --> 01:22:28,373
Fire!

<i>Shantu suggested to Father</i>

871
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:34,279
<i>that we honor all lives
lost that day.</i>

872
01:22:36,548 --> 01:22:38,450
<i>That in order to bring peace,</i>

873
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:42,021
<i>we must first acknowledge
our own mistakes</i>

874
01:22:42,155 --> 01:22:43,789
<i>and that those in power</i>

875

876
01:23:00,973 --> 01:23:03,408
<i>We ended up moving to Montana</i>

877
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:05,577
<i>and used the land
the government gave us</i>

878
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,946
<i>to start an orphanage.</i>

879
01:23:17,123 --> 01:23:21,060

881
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:38,044
Welcome.
Nice to see you.

882
01:23:39,511 --> 01:23:40,980
Thanks for bringing
the children.

883
01:23:41,113 --> 01:23:42,347
My pleasure.

884
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,582
Watch your step.

885
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:02,801
Figure it was time
I started dreaming again.

886

[horses' hooves clopping

888
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:34,746
What is your name, child?

889
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,115
Little Jack.

890
01:27:36,248 --> 01:27:39,085
Little Jack,
I'm Lizzy Calgrove.

891
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:41,320
This is my sister
Lily Calgrove.

892
01:27:41,454 --> 01:27:43,055
Hi, Lily Calgrove.

893
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:45,257
We're gonna take
really good care of you.

<i>You taught me
