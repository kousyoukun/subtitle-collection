1
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:11,946
On the other side
of the world...

2
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:15,613
in Europe the Allied forces
are pounding the Germans...

3
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,451
with relentless force.

4
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,289
We do not expect to have
a winter lull in Europe.

5
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:23,624
We expect to
keep striking...

6
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:25,289
to keep the enemy
on the move...

7
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,797
and hit him again
and again.

8
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:29,130
1944, December.

9
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:30,294
I was miles
from the front...

10
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,962
and a stranger to war.

11
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,631
Troops, fuel dumps...

12
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:34,798
enemy units...

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,808
they were pins
on a map to me.

14
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:38,002
Champagne?

15
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:40,478
Are you trying
to score a few points?

16
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:42,639
Just trying to aid
the war effort, Hart.

17
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:43,807
Tom.

18
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:44,975
Sir.

19
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,314
The captain needs a lift
back to the 106th.

20
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,818
Can you find him a driver?

21
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,650
I can take him, sir.

22
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,315
Funny. I had a feeling
you'd say that.

23
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,324
Well, there hasn't been
much movement today, sir.

24
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,155
So I see. Captain.

25
00:01:55,194 --> 00:01:56,320
Oh, don't forget, sir.

26
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:57,885
You wanted to send some of that
champagne along as well.

27
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,158
Yes.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,134
Yes, thank you
for reminding me, Tom.

29
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,793
The general should get
a kick out of that.

30
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,265
Colonel.

31
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:09,433
Troops are now fighting...

32
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:13,104
along a battle line
of 300 miles in Poland...

33
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,113
France, and Germany.

34
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:17,615
Within 10 weeks
after the first landings

35
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,947
in France last June,

36
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:24,115
the Allies have landed
nearly 2 million men.

37
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,290
You know what
this army could use, sir?

38
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:34,629
Snowplow services.

39
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,792
What we could use...

40
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,131
is half a million gallons
of gasoline...

41
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,466
and a road
that wasn't paved...

42
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:39,664
for Bouncing Betties.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,307
German S-mines.

44
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,502
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:46,641
You really ought
to spend a night...

46
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:47,838
on the line sometime,
Lieutenant.

47
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:50,815
I know that, sir.

48
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,477
Of course,
it's not too likely, is it?

49
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,679
Sir?

50
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,814
The Colonel says
your father is a senator.

51
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,323
So I guess you won't
spend too many nights...

52
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:00,848
in a foxhole, will you?

53
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,263
It's nothing
to be ashamed of, son.

54
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:07,128
That's a hell
of a father to have.

55
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,650
- Where to, sir?
- St. Vith.

56
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:35,793
I'm afraid you've gone
the wrong way, sir.

57
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:37,158
St. Vith is due west.

58
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:42,160
I'm pretty sure
St. Vith is due east.

59
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,166
Sergeant,
it's straight ahead.

60
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,164
Can I see that, sir?

61
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:56,473
I drove this route
yesterday, Sergeant.

62
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:57,675
Mm-hmm.

63
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:08,619
Get your hands up.

64
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:11,288
Out!

65
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:33,477
Halt!

66
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:16,844
Are you in great pain?

67
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,976
First Lieutenant...

68
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:21,815
Thomas Hart.

69
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:23,013
Serial number...

70
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:27,847
1841287.

71
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,360
Would you care
for a cigarette?

72
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:37,357
Your train is
an 8 kilometer march from here.

73
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,166
Of course,
with some shoes on...

74
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:41,364
you might be all right.

75
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,171
First Lieutenant...

76
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,369
Thomas Hart.

77
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:51,705
Serial number 1841287.

78
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,344
Thank you, Lieutenant.

79
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:56,012
But we both know...

80
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:57,885
there is much more
to you than that.

81
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,661
Show me locations
of the fuel dumps.

82
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,293
Just point...

83
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,666
and we can end all this.

84
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,523
I'll have your clothes
returned to you immediately.

85
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:40,190
When you are dressed,
we'll have another chat.

86
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,192
Our last one, I hope.

87
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,285
Smile, Joe.

88
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:06,756
For you the war is over.

89
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,022
Lieutenant.

90
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,199
This will help
against the cold.

91
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,331
No thanks, soldier.

92
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,499
I'll be all right.

93
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,667
No, you won't.

94
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,834
Come on. Take it.

95
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,343
Just till you warm up.

96
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:01,504
Take it, sir.

97
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:21,791
Hey, Captain...

98
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,631
does somebody tell our folks
about us being captured?

99
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,296
Germans give a list
to the military...

100
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:28,464
and the military
notifies the family.

101
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:29,837
Is that voluntary, sir?

102
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:32,472
How do you mean,
Lieutenant?

103
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,307
Uh, I mean...

104
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:35,676
can you ask them not to?

105
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:39,342
I don't think so.

106
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,542
Have to put
some straw in there.

107
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,845
Straw in your shoes...

108
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,044
for frostbite.

109
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,945
Another slave detail, sir.

110
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,782
Hey, ladies...

111
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,287
next batch of shells
you turn out...

112
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:53,449
nothing but duds
this time, all right?

113
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,321
Mortars no boom boom, ja?

114
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,290
Fire!

115
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,391
Captain, P-51 incoming.

116
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:04,731
- Incoming!
- Ours?

117
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:05,894
Get down, everybody!

118
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:07,096
Get down!

119
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:18,176
Everybody stay down!

120
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,375
Keep low!

121
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:25,585
Captain, what's happening?

122
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:26,749
Why are they
shooting at us?

123
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,950
They can't read the roof.

124
00:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,090
All right, get the doors!

125
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:36,429
Everybody get the doors!

126
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,627
Come on, now!

127
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:39,629
Get down!

128
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,838
Get down! Down!

129
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:50,973
Hart, help out!

130
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,683
- Come on!
- Go! Go! Go!

131
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,102
Go on, now!
Let's go!

132
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:22,404
Moving out!

133
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,209
Get the other cars!

134
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:30,753
Get the other cars!

135
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,085
Let's go! Now!

136
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,851
We're spelling out!

137
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:36,086
Round up your men now!

138
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:38,094
We're spelling out
our position!

139
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,288
We're spelling out!

140
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,758
Hart, get that man
clear of here.

141
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,427
Let's get in line!

142
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:45,935
Assemble on me!

143
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:48,028
- Assemble!
- Move it! Move it!

144
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,612
All right, men!

145
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,174
Let's get back in line!

146
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:02,741
Move it!

147
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,711
It's not helping.

148
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:31,941
Come on, men!

149
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,011
Oh, Christ.

150
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,111
Are you OK?

151
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,772
Keep looking at me.
Look at me.

152
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:04,973
Look at me.

153
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:07,910
Oh, shit. Shit.

154
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:10,317
All right.
Are you all right?

155
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:35,174
They're telling us to march.

156
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,044
Probably ought to take
his boots, Lieutenant.

157
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,647
Lieutenant!

158
00:14:41,685 --> 00:14:43,653
Take his boots.

159
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,484
'Cause either you
or some Jerry's gonna get 'em.

160
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:46,648
Take 'em, sir...

161
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,351
while you still got feet
to put 'em on.

162
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:50,819
His socks, too.

163
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,191
Ain't gonna help him any.

164
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,189
Stay together.

165
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,860
All right.

166
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:10,792
Once again...

167
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:17,467
I'm forced to remind you
escape is not a sport.

168
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:29,478
Think of it this way.

169
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:32,621
Now these Russians
have a chance...

170
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,145
at a happy new year.

171
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,331
Those are dogs
you're saluting, Colonel.

172
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,003
Animals.

173
00:17:58,848 --> 00:17:59,974
My country doesn't make...

174
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,483
those kinds of
distinctions, Colonel.

175
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:15,795
They're our allies, Colonel.

176
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,291
Oh, yes.
You and your allies.

177
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:23,470
Let me tell you
about you and your allies.

178
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,939
The Ministry of War
has just released the figures...

179
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,641
from our offensive
in the Ardennes.

180
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:37,116
Two hundred thousand Allies
killed or captured.

181
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,279
Your Third Army...

182
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:40,448
Patton...
in full retreat.

183
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,948
And the wehrmacht has captured
enough abundant fuel...

184
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:45,290
to retake Paris...

185
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:47,819
perhaps even drive
your troops back to the sea.

186
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:51,998
Might be a bit crowded
around here this winter.

187
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,243
Turn around, Joes.

188
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,378
Yes. Turn around.

189
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:21,119
Ross. Hart.

190
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,763
Ross and Hart.

191
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:25,961
I'm Captain Ross.

192
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:28,600
Major Clary.

193
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:29,764
Lieutenant Hart.

194
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,603
Lieutenant.

195
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,108
Debriefing, gentleman.
Officer's hut.

196
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:34,871
On the double.

197
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,846
The German counterattack on
the American Third Army front...

198
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:37,437
The German counterattack on
the American Third Army front...

199
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,606
is still going on.

200
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,774
The entire front...

201
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:41,943
stretching about
30 miles south of Monschau...

202
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,111
is in full view.

203
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:45,450
On our side,
countermeasures are being taken.

204
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,787
On the enemy's side,
more strafes are being flown in.

205
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:51,123
This is a major German effort.

206
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,787
Some of the best units
in the German army...

207
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:54,319
were involved
in this penetration.

208
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:56,958
At ease, soldier.

209
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,160
Sit down.

210
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:03,498
Thank you, sir.

211
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,674
So tell me, Lieutenant...

212
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,673
How come you're not dead?

213
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:13,675
Sir?

214
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:16,811
First you survive
crashing that jeep...

215
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:18,980
then Hans and Fritz
take your boots.

216
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:20,853
You got a rabbit's foot
in your pocket, son?

217
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,990
Two horseshoes
and a 4-leaf clover, sir.

218
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:26,188
Atta boy.

219
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:28,322
By the way...

220
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:29,695
you might want to take it easy
on that bread.

221
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,168
You haven't had anything
solid for a while.

222
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:35,329
Wouldn't want you to wind up
in the infirmary.

223
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:36,531
I don't know, sir.

224
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,675
After the march I just made...

225
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:42,041
and infirmary might look
like the Waldorf to me.

226
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:47,709
A stomach can shrink
quite a bit in 17 days.

227
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,679
That's the number, isn't it?

228
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,187
Seventeen days?

229
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:54,018
Six days on the train...

230
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,854
another 6 days of marching.

231
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,359
What was it, Joe?

232
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,553
Five days of interrogation?

233
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:00,555
No, sir.

234
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,160
Three days.

235
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:11,163
Well, anyway...
easy does it.

236
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:14,169
Yes, sir. Thank you.

237
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:17,472
So this interrogator
they threw at you...

238
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:18,844
his name wasn't Schumann,
was it?

239
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:25,847
No, sir.

240
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,350
Lutz.

241
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:33,689
Schumann was a real prick.

242
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,861
Almost broke me in two.

243
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:02,180
Not much for small talk,
I guess.

244
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:04,118
You come to appreciate that.

245
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,051
Smoke, Lieutenant?

246
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:13,225
Would you care
for a cigarette?

247
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,221
Again, Lieutenant,
I need to ask you...

248
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:19,227
the fuel dumps...

249
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:23,731
Thank you.

250
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:28,706
This Captain Lutz...

251
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,905
he know much about
your operations at the chateau?

252
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:34,909
He knew everything, sir.

253
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:37,879
Fuel dump locations?

254
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,080
Troop movements?

255
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:43,551
Sir, he knew what
I'd had for breakfast...

256
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:44,889
the morning of my capture.

257
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:54,763
Point,
and we can end all this.

258
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:02,710
Just name, rank,
and serial number.

259
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:08,376
Good enough.

260
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,045
You're excused, Lieutenant.

261
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:13,685
Unfortunately,
we won't be able...

262
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:14,848
to quarter you here.

263
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,016
We're full up.

264
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,616
We're gonna have to
put you in Barracks 27.

265
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:22,363
Isn't barracks 27
for enlisted men, sir?

266
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:23,524
Yes, it is...

267
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:24,691
but as you can see...

268
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,894
the Germans are doing a rather
brisk business these days.

269
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,063
You'll be comfortable there.

270
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,399
Sir.

271
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:37,575
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

272
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:16,878
Point.

273
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:24,188
Point or say
hello to stumps...

274
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:25,386
for the rest
of your life.

275
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,399
Good.

276
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,198
Don, are you in?
I called.

277
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:44,606
Hold your water, Joe.

278
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:45,573
Hold your water, Joe.

279
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,736
Looks like a whole division
just surrendered.

280
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:51,739
Who's in charge here?

281
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,211
Hey, how many we up to?

282
00:25:58,253 --> 00:25:59,880
Three lovely ladies,
big shot.

283
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:01,048
That's right.

284
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:02,147
That's right.

285
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:03,658
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

286
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,489
I'm looking for
who's in charge here.

287
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:07,358
From the looks of things,
I'd say Adolf Hitler.

288
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:10,195
I'm Lieutenant Tom Hart.

289
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,360
It's OK, folks.

290
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:14,995
Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford.

291
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:16,664
- Good to meet you.
- You, too.

292
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,332
You just come in
from Ardennes?

293
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:19,499
Yeah.

294
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,668
Colonel sent me over
to bunk in here.

295
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,200
Officers' barracks are full.

296
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,374
Well, in that case,
welcome to Rio.

297
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:28,842
Hope you don't mind, sir.

298
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:30,215
All we have is this
middle bunk right here.

299
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,847
It looks fine.

300
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,015
I'm betting you're
a Lucky Strike man.

301
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:36,854
You bet right.

302
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:38,018
Care for some hooch,
Lieutenant?

303
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,357
Ringing in the new year.

304
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:41,021
Uh, thanks. I'm fine.

305
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,530
It's fermented raisins,
mostly.

306
00:26:42,564 --> 00:26:44,361
A little turpentine
thrown in for flavor.

307
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:45,525
I'm fine.

308
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,535
We got anybody
left up front, sir?

309
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,537
How are you doing,
Lieutenant?

310
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,368
Private.

311
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:54,034
Give him a break, fellas.
He just got here.

312
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:55,543
Lieutenant.

313
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:56,703
Guard 'em with your life.

314
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:57,871
They double for cash
around here...

315
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,039
especially with the guards.

316
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:00,571
- Thanks, Sergeant.
- Excuse me a second.

317
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,181
Fellas, listen up.

318
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:04,978
Lieutenant Hart here...

319
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,817
is going to be staying
with us for a while.

320
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:08,686
- Hello, sir.
- Men.

321
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:11,689
Say, what's it take
to get in that poker game?

322
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:14,325
I expect we can work
something out.

323
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:16,160
Good.

324
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:19,167
Sir, are you about a size 10?

325
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:20,327
Why?

326
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,030
They got a Woolworth's
behind one of these barracks?

327
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:24,365
You never know.

328
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,156
Just piss on him, sir.

329
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:24,324
Huh?

330
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:25,697
It's the only thing
that gets him moving.

331
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:31,031
Happy New Year.

332
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:52,184
New year.

333
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:55,060
It's 1945!

334
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:57,387
Happy New Year!

335
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,338
Ten and a half
is the best I could do.

336
00:29:08,844 --> 00:29:10,175
The holiday season.

337
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:37,164
Look at the smile
on this guy.

338
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,672
Socks, too.

339
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,231
Could have used those
in the...

340
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:42,334
What's the matter,
you don't like trench foot?

341
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:45,005
Sure, it's just that
once my toenails turned black...

342
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:46,878
I didn't have a single purse
that matched.

343
00:29:58,473 --> 00:29:59,599
Square 'em up, Major.

344
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:00,801
Yes, sir.

345
00:30:11,553 --> 00:30:12,747
Look at this.

346
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:15,119
They've got those poor bastards
going around the clock now.

347
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:18,886
See that factory
up past the North tower?

348
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:21,054
The Germans are making bombs
right under our noses.

349
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:23,464
It's supposed to be
a shoe factory.

350
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,965
Instead, they've got the
Russians running in and out...

351
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,558
making mortar shells.

352
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:31,962
What the hell is that?

353
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,739
One of their flyers.

354
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:39,144
Wait a minute, they've got
niggers flying airplanes, now?

355
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,478
Three hundred and thirty-second
Fight Squadron.

356
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,881
I read about them
in "Yank Magazine."

357
00:30:43,852 --> 00:30:44,876
I'll be damned.

358
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,511
Well, we got us
some nigger officers.

359
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:50,514
Fucking Jerry's right.
We must be losing this war.

360
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:06,064
Five, 6, 7, 8. Lift! Lift!

361
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,151
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

362
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:28,860
Looks like it'll be a good show.

363
00:31:28,897 --> 00:31:29,886
Yeah, it does.

364
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,164
It's high stakes
around here, sir.

365
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:35,825
What do you mean?

366
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,632
Half the smokes in camp
are riding on...

367
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,163
where you're putting
the new men.

368
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,169
Where do you think
we should put them?

369
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:49,807
I think I'd give them
their own billet tent, sir.

370
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,609
Well, we can't do that.

371
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:56,751
I was thinking about
putting them in 27 with you.

372
00:31:58,426 --> 00:32:01,088
Sir, wouldn't they be better off
in the officers' barracks?

373
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,799
I don't carry enough weight
to move 2 officers out of 22.

374
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,298
I can't make them
the only 2 officers...

375
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:08,962
in the enlisted men's barracks.

376
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:12,238
You're in 27.

377
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:14,241
Figure you can keep
an eye on them for me.

378
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,140
Sir, I'm still new
to that barracks.

379
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:19,080
Don't carry a lot of weight
with the men yet.

380
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:21,810
You've got bars
on your shoulder, Lieutenant.

381
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,408
That ought to be weight enough.

382
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:30,751
Be done. Come on.

383
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:31,884
Tastes like chicken, right?

384
00:32:31,926 --> 00:32:33,985
No, you've got maggots.

385
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:35,461
It's protein. Eat.

386
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,124
- You called?
- Yeah.

387
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,826
What do you got?

388
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,699
Gonna have to to make
some room in here, fellas.

389
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:43,795
Come on in, men.

390
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:45,328
We got 2 more guests.

391
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,170
Second Lieutenants
Lamar Archer and Lincoln Scott.

392
00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:59,181
You've got to be kidding, sir.

393
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,211
They're gonna live here?

394
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,421
Two officers just
entered the barracks.

395
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,518
Where's your salute?

396
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:29,947
What's the big idea, sir?

397
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:31,713
I mean, we're all
full up in here.

398
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:33,380
Not anymore.

399
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:35,013
- Croutch, Krasner.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,889
You've been reassigned.
Barracks 28.

401
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:39,826
The Colonel wants you
situated before lockdown.

402
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,628
What were you flying?

403
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:50,001
P-51 bomber escorts.

404
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:52,640
Must be a shitload
of dead bomber crews...

405
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:53,971
scattered across Europe.

406
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,835
You see these bars,
Sergeant?

407
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:58,311
A pair of bars
don't make you fit to share...

408
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,813
the same roof
with white folks, boy.

409
00:33:59,847 --> 00:34:00,814
Bedford!

410
00:34:00,848 --> 00:34:02,713
That's Lieutenant, boy.
You got that?

411
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,241
Call yourself
whatever you want.

412
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:06,913
You're still just
a nigger to me.

413
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:08,149
I didn't quite catch that,
Sergeant.

414
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:09,747
- What was that?
- All right!

415
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,383
- That's enough!
- Just let it go.

416
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:22,429
Set, go!

417
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:23,794
Over... Over here!

418
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,825
Nice. Very nice!

419
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:39,707
Uh-oh! Deadline.

420
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:43,712
Lieutenant!
Mind grabbing that, boy?

421
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,090
What are you doing?

422
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:08,970
Nice one, sir!

423
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,704
Cookie, hey!

424
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,302
More bread.
More bread.

425
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:12,608
Das ist verboten!

426
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:16,808
Das ist verboten, Bedford!

427
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,884
Bon appetit!

428
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:45,267
Shit!

429
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:53,847
Nobody moves!

430
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,156
How bad, Sergeant?

431
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:00,956
Yeah, it's just a nick.
I'll be fine.

432
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:02,963
- You all right?
- Yeah.

433
00:37:30,224 --> 00:37:31,714
Fuck 'em!

434
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:49,471
- Go get that hand looked at.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:54,975
Hey, Bed.

436
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:56,567
Cigarettes?

437
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:17,219
You're a regular bank, Vic.

438
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,335
How's the hand?

439
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,996
Is that really what you
came over here to ask me?

440
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,563
No. Major Clary told me
that you went to see him...

441
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:30,907
to lodge a complaint about
Lieutenants Archer and Scott.

442
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:33,846
I'm sure he'll take it up with
Eisenhower first chance he gets.

443
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:36,277
They don't belong here.

444
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:39,643
Nobody belongs here.

445
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,951
But this is where
the colonel put them.

446
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,685
Yeah. I bet you wish the colonel
would have given you...

447
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,420
that open bunk
in the officers' barracks...

448
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,018
right about now, Lieutenant.

449
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:53,094
I mean, this is hardly
the Waldorf.

450
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:54,828
Ain't that right?

451
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,496
We're not going
to have a problem...

452
00:38:56,537 --> 00:38:58,596
about this, Sergeant,
understood?

453
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,166
What did you do before the war
for a living?

454
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,681
I was in law school.
Second year.

455
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:10,741
Harvard?

456
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:11,773
Yale.

457
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,117
- Meet many coloreds up there?
- A few.

458
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:16,247
Yeah, well,
I dealt with their kind.

459
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,121
Two years I was
on the police force...

460
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,683
in East St. Louis,
and I know what they are.

461
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:23,629
So let's not pretend like
we're fucking neighbors.

462
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,131
You finished, Sergeant?

463
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:26,598
No, I'm not finished.

464
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,797
Never did settle on a price,
did we...

465
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,135
for them boots and socks?

466
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,408
I mean, might be as cold as
the North Pole around here...

467
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,875
but that don't make me
Santa Claus.

468
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:41,144
What do you want?

469
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:44,147
I'll take your watch.

470
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,119
This was a gift from my father.

471
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:50,681
I bet your daddy
can afford you another one.

472
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,735
Is this going to buy me
a little civility, Sergeant?

473
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,036
Tons.

474
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:47,911
Not much of a picture, is it?

475
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,247
Well, we do feel
a little misled, sir.

476
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,378
Guard told us
they'd be showing...

477
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:55,888
the life and time
of Jesse Owens.

478
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,890
You know, you men can sit
up front with everyone else.

479
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,197
We're fine, sir.

480
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:09,668
Nobody's going to bother you.

481
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,567
I said we're fine, sir.

482
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:51,670
That was nice, C.W.
That was 18 inches.

483
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:53,838
Ah, come on, Joe.
It was 2 feet, at least.

484
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,280
Hey, either way,
my record still stands.

485
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,340
Cut it out, you guys.

486
00:41:57,384 --> 00:41:59,409
Up, up, up.

487
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,613
Everybody.
Out of the way.

488
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:02,815
- Out!
- Out of the bunks.

489
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:09,818
Attention.

490
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:11,330
Attention near the bunks.

491
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:12,831
Now.

492
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,432
Who is the ranking man in here?

493
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:19,902
Lieutenant Thomas Hart.

494
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:25,173
One of your men was out on the
compound tonight, Lieutenant.

495
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:28,806
He was spotted
on the East field...

496
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,976
removing a spike from
one of the billet tents.

497
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,211
Your men are aware of
this camp's policy...

498
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:36,449
concerning the possession
and concealment of weapons...

499
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,650
are they not?

500
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:40,888
Major, no one has
left this barracks.

501
00:42:58,912 --> 00:42:59,970
Whoa, wait a minute.
What the hell...

502
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:00,980
Quiet.

503
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:02,641
- But this is a plant.
- Quiet.

504
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:03,944
- Somebody put that...
- Quiet.

505
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,485
You bastard, I heard you go out.

506
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,588
I should have seen this coming.

507
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,462
Major, where are
you taking this man?

508
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:21,660
Examples must be made,
Lieutenant.

509
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:24,397
We take the safety of
our men very seriously.

510
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,468
Major, where are you all
taking him?

511
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,572
What did he do?

512
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:29,459
I'll kill you.

513
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:32,562
I'll fucking kill you, Bedford.

514
00:44:32,606 --> 00:44:33,971
You put that spike...

515
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,565
Watch your mouth, nigger.

516
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:37,600
You put that spike there.
Get off of me.

517
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:39,111
- Lincoln, look at me.
- Get off of me.

518
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:46,810
Can I let you go, Lincoln?

519
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:50,753
It's a minor offense, Colonel.

520
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:55,190
This man deserved 15 days
in the cooler, not execution.

521
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:56,354
He attempted to escape.

522
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:57,829
Bullshit.

523
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,128
You dragged him out of his
barracks barely clothed.

524
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,929
Your men lined him up
and shot him.

525
00:45:01,968 --> 00:45:03,435
This man wasn't trying
to escape...

526
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,734
any more than those Russians
you hung the other day.

527
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:06,796
Is he a dog?

528
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,199
A lesser race?

529
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:13,913
There's a word you
Americans use, as I remember.

530
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:18,749
But of course, your country
doesn't make such distinctions.

531
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:22,214
And neither do you, I'm sure.

532
00:45:22,255 --> 00:45:23,313
He was an officer...

533
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,814
a lieutenant in
the Army Air Corps.

534
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,851
Yeah. That's why you were
so eager...

535
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:31,363
to welcome him and the other one
into your barracks.

536
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:34,126
Look it up, Colonel.

537
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,828
We have every right
to question a man...

538
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,269
for concealment of
a dangerous weapon.

539
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:39,862
This man had rights, too.

540
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,932
The Geneva Convention...

541
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:43,408
specifically forbids
summary executions.

542
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:45,070
Take a look around you, Colonel.

543
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,544
This is not Geneva.

544
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,188
Where are you going?

545
00:45:57,223 --> 00:45:58,451
To check on my men.

546
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,056
You're welcome to do so,
of course.

547
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:05,364
In the meantime, I'll be looking
in on your barracks...

548
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:08,492
to listen to what's on
the B.B.C. This evening.

549
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:06,215
Now go see your men, Colonel.

550
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:09,988
Good night.

551
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:46,494
Not to love the Fuhrer
is a great disgrace

552
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:50,873
so we heil, heil
right in the Fuhrer's face

553
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:57,207
Is we not the super friend?

554
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,241
Aryan pure supermen?

555
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:01,253
Ja, we is der supermen

556
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,255
Super-duper supermen

557
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,187
Is this Nazi land

558
00:48:04,223 --> 00:48:05,383
Let's go.

559
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:14,659
How's Scott holding up?

560
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:17,227
It's hard to tell.

561
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,430
He isn't saying much.

562
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:22,105
He was asking about the body.

563
00:48:23,142 --> 00:48:25,576
And there's some personal
effects... dog tags.

564
00:48:51,771 --> 00:48:52,795
Come on, boys.

565
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,756
Take that, you bastard.

566
00:49:14,794 --> 00:49:16,284
Careful, Bedford.

567
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,354
That's a nigger
you're rooting for.

568
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:20,160
Tail's painted red...

569
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:23,362
means he's 99th,
right out of Tuskegee, boy.

570
00:49:46,993 --> 00:49:48,358
Come on, let's get him out!

571
00:49:49,328 --> 00:49:50,989
Get them out of there.

572
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:57,594
Get him to the doc, now.

573
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:03,934
Put this out. Come on!

574
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,678
More buckets, more buckets.
Quickly, come on.

575
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,978
Come on!

576
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,066
- Move around this corner.
- Yes, sir.

577
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:44,940
Do you know where
I wish I'd never been?

578
00:51:45,945 --> 00:51:47,139
Where's that?

579
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:48,578
The goddamn Waldorf.

580
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:51,538
It's not personal.

581
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,282
He just can't stand
being lied to.

582
00:51:55,421 --> 00:51:57,719
- I never lied to him.
- Go on.

583
00:51:57,757 --> 00:52:00,225
You hung yourself the minute
he debriefed you.

584
00:52:01,227 --> 00:52:02,990
That guy Lutz
they threw on you...

585
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,490
he was a level 1 interrogator.

586
00:52:06,432 --> 00:52:07,899
McNamara had him, too.

587
00:52:09,101 --> 00:52:12,400
When a guy won't talk, they just
keep kicking him up the ladder.

588
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,132
Level 2, level 3.

589
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,266
It takes weeks.

590
00:52:18,144 --> 00:52:19,907
He was in there for a month.

591
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:21,810
The only guy you saw was Lutz...

592
00:52:22,481 --> 00:52:24,312
and he spit you out of there
in 3 days.

593
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,446
All I gave them was name,
rank, and serial number.

594
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:32,650
See, the thing about the colonel
is he's not like you and me.

595
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,454
He's West Point,
fourth generation.

596
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,461
He was raised on all this.

597
00:52:37,596 --> 00:52:38,995
The crap like this...

598
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,499
catching a junior officer
in an obvious lie...

599
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,999
all it does is remind him
of how far away he is...

600
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,368
from the real war...

601
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,030
the one he's supposed
to be fighting.

602
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,672
You see?

603
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:36,149
Lieutenant Lincoln.

604
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:50,429
Should have sold some tickets
for this one.

605
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:33,886
Two of your men dead
in 2 days, Colonel.

606
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:35,549
It seems you've lost control
of your company.

607
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,593
Will Lieutenant Scott be granted
the right to stand trial...

608
00:54:40,629 --> 00:54:42,187
and face this charge?

609
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,357
Major Fussel saw him
standing over the body.

610
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:46,299
I would say he's had his trial.

611
00:54:46,968 --> 00:54:49,163
Any prisoner accused of a crime
against another prisoner...

612
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:50,466
has a right to a trial.

613
00:54:50,505 --> 00:54:52,666
And if the boy
were being held in Alabama...

614
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:54,106
there wouldn't be
any trial at all.

615
00:54:54,142 --> 00:54:55,473
Is this not so?

616
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,006
Yeah, maybe you're
right, Colonel.

617
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:00,947
Maybe we should
just forget the trial.

618
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:02,609
Let's just drag him
out of the barracks...

619
00:55:02,651 --> 00:55:03,811
and shoot 2 holes
in his chest...

620
00:55:03,852 --> 00:55:05,479
like you do with
Lieutenant Archer.

621
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,218
A trial.

622
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,086
A court-martial.

623
00:55:14,296 --> 00:55:16,628
Like in your American movies?

624
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,691
Yes?

625
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:21,329
Yeah, something like that.

626
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:23,831
That should be fun.

627
00:55:25,173 --> 00:55:26,333
Yeah.

628
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:29,169
All right, Colonel.

629
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:32,306
You may conduct it...

630
00:55:32,347 --> 00:55:33,507
in your theater here.

631
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:52,075
Colonel, my men are in
this theater every day.

632
00:55:52,113 --> 00:55:53,239
With your permission...

633
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:54,407
we'd like to erect
a billet tent...

634
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:55,575
to house the proceedings.

635
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:56,743
No.

636
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:58,912
Your theater
will do quite nicely.

637
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:00,250
You have until
the end of the week...

638
00:56:00,288 --> 00:56:01,414
to conduct your trial.

639
00:56:01,456 --> 00:56:03,083
It's a capital charge,
Colonel.

640
00:56:03,124 --> 00:56:04,751
The trial will take
more than a few days.

641
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:06,761
One thousand more American
prisoners from the Ardennes...

642
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:08,763
will be arriving
over the weekend.

643
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:11,265
I am putting them
in your theater.

644
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:12,425
Colonel, I just
explained to you...

645
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:13,627
Colonel...

646
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,300
Saturday, your theater is mine.

647
00:56:30,084 --> 00:56:31,244
Wait. Colonel!

648
00:56:32,754 --> 00:56:33,914
This is a murder site.

649
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:44,894
I beg your pardon,
Lieutenant.

650
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:46,093
I said
this is a murder site.

651
00:56:47,602 --> 00:56:48,728
The body and
everything around it...

652
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,738
are now evidence.

653
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:52,069
This area cannot
be disturbed...

654
00:56:52,106 --> 00:56:53,596
until everything
is photographed.

655
00:56:57,779 --> 00:56:58,939
Of course.

656
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:13,450
I'm appointing you counsel
for Lieutenant Scott.

657
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:19,031
Sir, I'm not a lawyer.

658
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:20,557
You sounded like one
a minute ago.

659
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:24,402
I could be
a material witness.

660
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,867
I mean, I heard
the lieutenant going out.

661
00:57:26,908 --> 00:57:28,205
The lieutenant
needs our help.

662
00:57:28,243 --> 00:57:30,541
I've appointed you counsel.

663
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:31,738
Understood?

664
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:34,540
Yes, sir.

665
00:57:34,582 --> 00:57:35,742
Dismissed, Lieutenant.

666
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:38,912
Sir.

667
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:24,531
And this guy
that's prosecuting me...

668
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:25,897
this Captain Sisk...

669
00:58:26,901 --> 00:58:28,232
is he a real lawyer?

670
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:30,697
Yes.

671
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:32,228
That sounds about right.

672
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:37,210
I think we have to paint
this thing as a fight, Scott.

673
00:58:37,245 --> 00:58:38,712
That's all.

674
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:40,407
It was a fight
that got a little out of hand.

675
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:44,078
You're supposed to ask me
if I did it, first.

676
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:48,749
Look, I came here
to kill Nazis.

677
00:58:50,258 --> 00:58:52,385
If it was some crackers
that I wanted to kill...

678
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:53,724
I could have stayed in Macon.

679
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:55,888
Major Fussel ID'd you
standing over the body.

680
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,397
Fussel is a Nazi!

681
00:58:57,432 --> 00:58:59,764
No. Fussel is a witness...

682
00:59:01,936 --> 00:59:03,096
and he's enough to hang you.

683
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:07,066
Look, all I'm saying
is if it was a fight...

684
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:08,234
that got a little
out of hand...

685
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:09,573
then it's not murder.

686
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:10,737
It's manslaughter.

687
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:12,268
Do you understand that?

688
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:21,548
Man, oh, man.

689
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:25,859
Can I fire you?

690
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:27,190
Oh, look, Scott,
I'm just trying...

691
00:59:27,228 --> 00:59:29,059
If it's a colored guy
on trial...

692
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,359
and it's a white man
who's been murdered...

693
00:59:33,401 --> 00:59:35,699
there's no such thing
as manslaughter.

694
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:37,705
Don't you know that?

695
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:39,206
Or is that something
that they teach you...

696
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,071
in the third year
of law school?

697
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:45,542
What do you expect
from me, anyway?

698
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,047
A "Hey, yes, sir, boss."

699
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:50,710
Or "Why, thank you, boss.
You're mighty kind."

700
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:53,220
Is that the way
a railroaded colored man acts...

701
00:59:53,254 --> 00:59:54,380
where you're from?

702
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:55,548
Nobody's railroading you, Scott.

703
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,217
Then how come
the only real lawyer...

704
00:59:57,258 --> 00:59:58,725
is the guy
that's prosecuting me...

705
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,921
and I'm stuck with you
defending me?

706
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:05,755
That's how the Colonel
wanted it.

707
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,092
Yeah, but I ain't
being railroaded.

708
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:24,752
I'll meet you
back at the barracks.

709
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:25,946
Yes, sir.

710
01:00:37,632 --> 01:00:38,758
Well, Lieutenant?

711
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,098
I'm gonna need
a few things, sir.

712
01:00:41,135 --> 01:00:43,103
Who has Bedford's
personal effects?

713
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:44,434
We do.

714
01:00:44,472 --> 01:00:46,269
I'll need to see them...

715
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:47,968
and the photographs
that were taken of the scene...

716
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,300
and of course, his body.

717
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,140
What did Scott tell you?

718
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:56,609
Sir?

719
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:57,777
You were with him all day.

720
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:58,979
What did he tell you?

721
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:01,948
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't reveal that.

722
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:03,149
Sure you can.

723
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:07,157
Attorney-client privilege, sir.

724
01:01:08,663 --> 01:01:11,291
Only an attorney
has attorney-client privilege.

725
01:01:11,332 --> 01:01:12,629
I need to be briefed
on everything...

726
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,794
that Scott intends
to testify to.

727
01:01:14,836 --> 01:01:17,304
Sir, you're going to be
President of the court-martial.

728
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:19,568
How can I possibly
discuss our case with you?

729
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:20,733
Are you suggesting...

730
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:21,935
that I would betray
Lieutenant Scott?

731
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:24,404
That I would share
details of his case...

732
01:01:24,445 --> 01:01:25,605
with the prosecution?

733
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:30,414
No, sir.

734
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:33,249
Scott followed Bedford out
through the night latrine.

735
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:34,584
If he testifies to that fact...

736
01:01:34,622 --> 01:01:36,590
every German in this camp
will know how we get in...

737
01:01:36,624 --> 01:01:38,592
and out of the barracks
after dark...

738
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:40,253
and every man in this camp
would be compromised...

739
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:41,420
because of that.

740
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:42,929
Are you following this,
Lieutenant?

741
01:01:42,964 --> 01:01:44,454
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

742
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:48,928
Now, Scott will testify
that he went out...

743
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,597
through a hole
beneath the stove...

744
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:52,765
in the barracks.

745
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:55,605
And you will make certain
that he is clear on that.

746
01:01:55,643 --> 01:01:57,270
Do we understand each other,
Lieutenant?

747
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:58,471
We do, sir.

748
01:01:59,647 --> 01:02:00,807
Dismissed.

749
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,947
Permission to speak, sir.

750
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:05,452
Speak freely.

751
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:07,477
Scott thinks this is all
just for show.

752
01:02:09,323 --> 01:02:10,449
He thinks you passed sentence...

753
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:11,822
as soon as the body
hit the ground.

754
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:16,990
Is he right?

755
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:20,100
Bedford's footlocker
is in my barracks.

756
01:02:21,102 --> 01:02:22,262
I'll make sure you get it.

757
01:02:59,473 --> 01:03:01,464
Not much to look at, is he?

758
01:03:10,384 --> 01:03:11,544
Did you know him?

759
01:03:12,386 --> 01:03:13,683
No.

760
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:15,689
Not personally.

761
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:17,714
But my guards certainly
seemed to.

762
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:20,324
These are for you.

763
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:26,325
Thank you.

764
01:03:29,336 --> 01:03:30,496
How well?

765
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:34,040
Your guards,
you said they knew him.

766
01:03:34,074 --> 01:03:35,234
How well?

767
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:39,569
Well, you'll have to ask them
about that.

768
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:47,413
This is yours, too.

769
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:52,923
We found it on his wrist.

770
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,895
But with the inscription...

771
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,727
and those new boots
on your feet...

772
01:03:57,765 --> 01:03:58,925
I made the assumption.

773
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:03,896
It's a little hard
to imagine, Colonel...

774
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:07,237
your guards
sitting for an interview.

775
01:04:07,274 --> 01:04:08,605
I can arrange it.

776
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:11,771
I can arrange
anything you like.

777
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:15,074
It seems only fair...

778
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:17,675
what with your colonel
throwing you to the wolves.

779
01:04:19,954 --> 01:04:21,819
I'm not sure I follow you.

780
01:04:21,855 --> 01:04:23,015
Really?

781
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:27,692
Yale isn't in the habit
of accepting half-wits.

782
01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:31,889
At least it wasn't
when I was studying there.

783
01:04:34,468 --> 01:04:37,767
The oldest member
of the class of '28.

784
01:04:38,973 --> 01:04:41,874
My fellow students voted me
hardest worker.

785
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:49,182
But we can swap stories
some other time, can't we?

786
01:04:49,216 --> 01:04:51,980
Right now we've got a trial
to prepare for.

787
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,287
It's a sincere offer,
Lieutenant.

788
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,458
Anything I can do to help...

789
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,590
Truly.

790
01:05:08,035 --> 01:05:10,265
And exactly where were you,
Major Fussel...

791
01:05:10,304 --> 01:05:11,601
on the night in question?

792
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,268
I was walking the area
behind this theater...

793
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:16,833
and the Australian compound.

794
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:18,310
At about what time?

795
01:05:18,746 --> 01:05:20,873
Maybe about 1:00
in the morning.

796
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:23,542
And can you tell the court
what you saw?

797
01:05:24,218 --> 01:05:28,018
The schwarz Lieutenant Scott
was kneeling over the body.

798
01:05:28,055 --> 01:05:31,422
It looked to me like he was
checking that the man was dead.

799
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,483
I blew my whistle,
and he started to run.

800
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:35,290
And what did you do next?

801
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:38,423
I would have shot,
but it was dark.

802
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:40,564
And so was he.

803
01:05:42,236 --> 01:05:44,534
Major Fussel, how well
did you know Sergeant Bedford?

804
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:45,697
A little, I think.

805
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:47,263
You traded with him regularly.

806
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:48,867
Traded?

807
01:05:48,909 --> 01:05:50,035
Bartered.

808
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,908
Cigarettes for a pair of boots.

809
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:53,503
Chocolate for some spare parts.

810
01:05:53,547 --> 01:05:55,947
No. I never did this.

811
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,814
A kriegie trading
with a German soldier?

812
01:05:58,852 --> 01:06:00,012
I never saw it.

813
01:06:00,688 --> 01:06:03,316
Am I allowed to repeat what
he actually said to Captain?

814
01:06:03,357 --> 01:06:04,517
You may, Private.

815
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:06,855
Lieutenant Scott said,
"I'll kill you.

816
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,185
"I'll fucking kill you,
Bedford."

817
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,422
Corporal, have you ever
heard any other man...

818
01:06:11,465 --> 01:06:13,956
threaten a fellow soldier
during your time in the army?

819
01:06:14,001 --> 01:06:15,866
"Better shape up
or I'll kill you."

820
01:06:15,903 --> 01:06:17,530
"I'll kill you if you touch
my cigarettes again."

821
01:06:17,571 --> 01:06:19,436
- That sort of thing?
- Yes, sir.

822
01:06:19,473 --> 01:06:22,033
I'll bet you've even made such
a threat yourself once or twice.

823
01:06:22,076 --> 01:06:23,202
I suppose so.

824
01:06:23,243 --> 01:06:24,938
Corporal, did you ever
actually kill any of the men...

825
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:26,138
you threatened in this manner?

826
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:28,841
No, sir.

827
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:30,977
But I'm not colored.

828
01:06:31,819 --> 01:06:32,979
I can control myself.

829
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:35,455
So, you, too,
had heard the threats...

830
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:37,582
made by the accused
against Sergeant Bedford?

831
01:06:37,624 --> 01:06:39,615
Your Honor, this being the
fourth prosecution witness...

832
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,685
called to testify
in this matter...

833
01:06:41,729 --> 01:06:43,321
if the defense will stipulate
that the accused...

834
01:06:43,364 --> 01:06:45,662
did indeed threaten the life
of Sergeant Bedford...

835
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:47,291
could we dispense
with any further testimony...

836
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,494
- to his having done so?
- Your Honor...

837
01:06:48,535 --> 01:06:50,867
Sergeant Webb is being called
as an eyewitness...

838
01:06:50,904 --> 01:06:52,030
to the crime itself.

839
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:53,596
He's what?

840
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,800
Is that right, Sergeant?

841
01:06:55,409 --> 01:06:56,535
Yes, sir.

842
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:57,839
- Sir, that's a lie.
- Your Honor...

843
01:06:57,878 --> 01:07:00,210
the sergeant will testify that
on the night of the murder...

844
01:07:00,247 --> 01:07:03,045
he watched through a window
in barracks 27...

845
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,779
as Lieutenant Scott
accosted Sergeant Bedford...

846
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:07,878
outside the theater
and broke his neck.

847
01:07:07,921 --> 01:07:09,047
Your Honor,
he did no such thing.

848
01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:10,488
I was standing
right beside Sergeant Webb...

849
01:07:10,524 --> 01:07:11,786
at the exact time
of the murder.

850
01:07:11,825 --> 01:07:13,793
- He saw nothing of the sort.
- The hell I didn't.

851
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:15,895
You don't know what I saw.

852
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:18,523
Sir, I request that this court
instruct this witness

853
01:07:18,565 --> 01:07:20,760
as to the consequences of
perjuring himself in a court...

854
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:22,200
He put his hand on the Bible...

855
01:07:22,236 --> 01:07:23,669
and swore to tell the truth,
Lieutenant.

856
01:07:23,704 --> 01:07:24,830
- That's good enough for me.
- Objection, Your Honor.

857
01:07:24,872 --> 01:07:25,998
We've had no prior notice
of his testimony.

858
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:27,666
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
- Your Honor, his bias alone...

859
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:28,868
Lieutenant!

860
01:07:31,678 --> 01:07:32,838
Sit down, please.

861
01:07:44,558 --> 01:07:45,718
I'll catch up.

862
01:07:48,162 --> 01:07:50,062
I gotta go make some trades
in barracks 18.

863
01:07:50,097 --> 01:07:52,190
See if you
can get me some smokes.

864
01:07:52,232 --> 01:07:53,392
Webb...

865
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:55,993
You're a lying sack of shit,
you know that?

866
01:07:56,036 --> 01:07:57,367
Yeah, and maybe you ought
to mind your own business.

867
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:58,530
This doesn't concern you, West.

868
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:00,130
- Hey, Lieutenant.
- Or you. Any of you.

869
01:08:00,174 --> 01:08:02,233
What do you know, Joe?
George S. Patton just showed up.

870
01:08:02,276 --> 01:08:04,039
Return to your barracks,
Corporal.

871
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:05,510
Take your 2 friends with you.

872
01:08:10,784 --> 01:08:11,944
So, what is it, Webb?

873
01:08:12,352 --> 01:08:13,842
Up there today.

874
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:15,983
You think you owe it to Vic?

875
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,552
Why are you so bent about
that flying bellhop anyway?

876
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:21,720
He's a soldier.

877
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:23,286
Vic Bedford was a soldier.

878
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:26,397
He fought.
He had courage.

879
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,499
You wouldn't know too much about
that, would you, Lieutenant?

880
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:31,498
You lied in there today.

881
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:34,298
You didn't see what happened
any more than I did.

882
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:38,072
I didn't have to.
I know.

883
01:08:38,111 --> 01:08:39,271
Not good enough.

884
01:08:40,514 --> 01:08:42,038
It's good enough for McNamara.

885
01:09:05,138 --> 01:09:07,197
Sorry about what happened
in there today, Lincoln.

886
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:09,736
I didn't see it coming.

887
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,037
You're saying that's
the first time...

888
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:15,742
you seen a man lie
through his teeth...

889
01:09:15,782 --> 01:09:17,113
holding his hand on a bible?

890
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,113
I was writing a letter
to my father.

891
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:24,419
Figured I should tell him first.

892
01:09:28,695 --> 01:09:31,186
He was part of
the 369th Infantry...

893
01:09:31,231 --> 01:09:34,200
in the last war,
the old 15th.

894
01:09:35,068 --> 01:09:40,062
They was the first negro troops
to go into action in France.

895
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:43,875
Did your father serve?

896
01:09:46,013 --> 01:09:47,537
My father
was in headquarters.

897
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:49,948
He had an 8
on his shoulder, too.

898
01:09:49,983 --> 01:09:51,280
His father made sure of it.

899
01:09:52,886 --> 01:09:54,547
That's how we do things
in our family.

900
01:09:57,758 --> 01:09:58,918
That's a shame.

901
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:02,386
Got your testimony to prepare.

902
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:06,625
Yeah.

903
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:38,758
Lieutenant.

904
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:40,593
How are you?

905
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:43,532
Not too well, I imagine.

906
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:45,765
Come on up.

907
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,357
That was quite a beating
you took today.

908
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,160
It's warm inside.

909
01:11:05,378 --> 01:11:06,970
You've read Mark Twain?

910
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,173
It's wonderful.

911
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,082
Colonel, I have witnesses
to prepare for.

912
01:11:11,117 --> 01:11:12,607
Yes. I know.

913
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,112
It's why I wanted to see you.

914
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:34,235
We keep a library of all
American military manuals.

915
01:11:35,008 --> 01:11:38,341
I thought this one might be
of particular use to you.

916
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:44,546
I can't accept this, Colonel.

917
01:11:44,584 --> 01:11:45,608
We have a policy
about fraternizing...

918
01:11:45,652 --> 01:11:47,847
Lieutenant,
without this, your client...

919
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,684
will face the firing squad.

920
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:51,988
Would that be better?

921
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:01,627
Your son?

922
01:12:03,303 --> 01:12:04,463
Yes.

923
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:06,498
Where's he fighting?

924
01:12:11,978 --> 01:12:13,138
He is not anymore.

925
01:12:15,682 --> 01:12:17,172
The Russian front.

926
01:12:20,954 --> 01:12:22,114
Horrible place.

927
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,092
I'm sorry.

928
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:32,757
I killed my share of English
and French, I suppose...

929
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:35,796
in the first war.

930
01:12:38,204 --> 01:12:39,933
They had fathers, too.

931
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,011
It's verboten, you know.

932
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:56,214
Negro jazz.

933
01:12:58,224 --> 01:13:00,715
These might be the only copies
of their kind...

934
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,920
in the entire Reich.

935
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:07,328
But I'm quite fond of them.

936
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:13,332
Nice to read by, anyway.

937
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,500
Takes a man right back.

938
01:13:21,114 --> 01:13:22,547
Take a seat.

939
01:13:26,552 --> 01:13:27,712
Thank you for your time,
Colonel.

940
01:13:29,789 --> 01:13:30,949
Lieutenant...

941
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:36,021
Enjoy the manual.

942
01:13:58,151 --> 01:13:59,778
Come to order, gentlemen.

943
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:01,343
Captain Sisk,
is the prosecution...

944
01:14:01,387 --> 01:14:02,615
prepared to call
its next witness?

945
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,781
We are, Your Honor.

946
01:14:03,823 --> 01:14:05,654
Begging the court's pardon, sir.

947
01:14:06,459 --> 01:14:07,585
Yes, Lieutenant?

948
01:14:07,627 --> 01:14:08,753
Before we continue,
Your Honor...

949
01:14:08,795 --> 01:14:10,353
it's been brought to
my attention that the court...

950
01:14:10,396 --> 01:14:12,887
may have overlooked a few
procedural matters yesterday.

951
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:16,794
I'm referring to the "U.S. Army
Manual for Courts-Martial"...

952
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:20,000
chapter 12, sections 57, 58.

953
01:14:21,107 --> 01:14:22,233
Make your point.

954
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:23,708
According to these sections,
Your Honor...

955
01:14:23,743 --> 01:14:26,109
the court was obliged yesterday
to ask the accused...

956
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:28,477
if he wished to challenge
any members of the court...

957
01:14:28,514 --> 01:14:31,381
for peremptory disqualification
before any pleas were entered.

958
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,414
A little late in the game
for that, isn't it, Lieutenant?

959
01:14:35,455 --> 01:14:37,582
Nevertheless, it is a right...

960
01:14:37,623 --> 01:14:39,113
specifically granted
to the defendant.

961
01:14:44,263 --> 01:14:45,423
Very well.

962
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:49,264
Does the accused
wish to challenge...

963
01:14:49,302 --> 01:14:50,633
any member of the court now?

964
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,430
We do, Your Honor.

965
01:14:53,973 --> 01:14:55,133
You, sir.

966
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:59,841
Request denied.
Proceed, Captain Sisk.

967
01:14:59,879 --> 01:15:02,780
Sir, according to chapter 12,
section 58d...

968
01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:04,612
defense is allowed
1 peremptory challenge...

969
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:05,776
of the board,
and this challenge...

970
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:08,116
is not subject to any ruling
by the court itself.

971
01:15:08,154 --> 01:15:09,280
Request denied, Lieutenant.

972
01:15:09,322 --> 01:15:11,847
Then the court must address
section 58e...

973
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:13,586
which states the defense
may disqualify...

974
01:15:13,626 --> 01:15:15,423
a member of the board
for cause...

975
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:17,395
if that member
has displayed a bias...

976
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:18,897
toward the accused or his case.

977
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,398
This court has shown no bias
in this case, Lieutenant.

978
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:21,559
Your Honor,
the court has demonstrated...

979
01:15:21,601 --> 01:15:23,933
in ex parte conversations
before the commencement...

980
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:27,770
of this hearing a distinct
prejudice against the accused...

981
01:15:27,807 --> 01:15:30,935
his case, and his counsel, sir.

982
01:15:46,592 --> 01:15:47,923
Very well.

983
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,087
We'll take a short recess
to consider the matter.

984
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,931
- Lieutenant Hart.
- Sir?

985
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,626
Can I see you outside
for a moment, please?

986
01:16:08,915 --> 01:16:10,314
Sir?

987
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:12,010
Listen to me,
you pampered little shit.

988
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,647
I will not be laughed at.
Not by him.

989
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,453
Sir, I'm just trying
to protect my client.

990
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,789
Your client's about to lose
his lawyer, Lieutenant.

991
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:23,387
Sir?

992
01:16:23,429 --> 01:16:26,330
Article 32: Contempt of court.

993
01:16:26,966 --> 01:16:29,332
Article 70: Intentional delay.

994
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:32,567
I know the book, too.

995
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:33,902
Forwards and backwards.

996
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,407
Then you must know, sir, that...

997
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:37,272
Shut up and listen to me,
Lieutenant.

998
01:16:38,945 --> 01:16:42,278
You will not accept anything
from that commandant again.

999
01:16:42,315 --> 01:16:43,475
Is that clear?

1000
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:46,414
You will not allow him
to participate...

1001
01:16:46,452 --> 01:16:48,147
in these proceedings,
is that clear?

1002
01:16:49,222 --> 01:16:51,087
You will never set foot
in his office again...

1003
01:16:51,123 --> 01:16:52,351
without my permission.

1004
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:54,819
We understand each other?

1005
01:17:11,644 --> 01:17:15,512
...and propaganda reported
by them...

1006
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:18,108
and by the Germans
over Strasbourg.

1007
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,649
One minute you can hear
Hitler himself announcing...

1008
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:25,123
that he will be in Strasbourg
by January the 30th...

1009
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:28,320
the anniversary of the Nazis
coming to power in Germany.

1010
01:17:29,028 --> 01:17:32,259
The next, the Nazis are claiming
that 2 new divisions...

1011
01:17:32,298 --> 01:17:33,890
are advancing on Strasbourg...

1012
01:17:33,933 --> 01:17:37,061
and that the Americans are
in full flight from Alsace.

1013
01:17:38,104 --> 01:17:41,005
The closer they get,
the more violent they become.

1014
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,840
The Nazi menace are offering
their promises.

1015
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:46,669
But today...

1016
01:17:46,712 --> 01:17:49,306
Come in. Have a seat.

1017
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:53,484
We've checked German...

1018
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:58,950
Have a drink.

1019
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:00,785
Sure.

1020
01:18:03,629 --> 01:18:06,189
Maybe you can help me
decipher some of this code...

1021
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:09,827
coming through
the BBC tonight, yeah?

1022
01:18:09,869 --> 01:18:11,427
I don't think you need
my help, Colonel.

1023
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,629
Seems pretty clear
what they're saying.

1024
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,378
It would seem so.

1025
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:28,050
Or perhaps
it's all propaganda.

1026
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:29,714
How about that?

1027
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,733
Strange thing about war wounds.

1028
01:18:54,013 --> 01:18:58,245
The older you grow, the less
proud you become of them.

1029
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:27,305
Got another one of these
around here somewhere?

1030
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,742
Of course.

1031
01:19:29,782 --> 01:19:32,876
Good. Why don't you and I take
a walk out on your compound...

1032
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:34,613
and have ourselves
an old-fashioned duel?

1033
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:39,189
That would be fitting,
wouldn't it?

1034
01:19:40,659 --> 01:19:42,889
But surely you can think
of a more clever way...

1035
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:45,692
out of this camp
than that, yes?

1036
01:19:52,604 --> 01:19:57,598
You think the war will wait
for you, is that it, Colonel?

1037
01:19:59,812 --> 01:20:04,806
It won't, you know.
They never do.

1038
01:20:12,191 --> 01:20:13,351
You're drunk.

1039
01:20:14,693 --> 01:20:15,853
Yeah.

1040
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:20,227
But I'm seeing things
very clearly.

1041
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:29,139
You know, sometimes I think
your Lieutenant Scott...

1042
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:31,142
might have been better off
in Alabama.

1043
01:20:32,377 --> 01:20:35,107
Lynchings are over in minutes.

1044
01:20:36,715 --> 01:20:41,152
The kind of justice he's
suffering here is far crueler.

1045
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,282
Is that why you gave
Lieutenant Hart the manual?

1046
01:20:45,624 --> 01:20:48,184
I was merely
trying to help the lad.

1047
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:50,187
He's got enough
to worry about...

1048
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:51,958
without providing you
with amusement.

1049
01:20:53,732 --> 01:20:54,892
Yes.

1050
01:20:57,069 --> 01:20:59,594
He's got you to worry about,
hasn't he?

1051
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,740
Stay out of our business.

1052
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:09,039
Forgive me, Colonel,
but you're hardly...

1053
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:11,174
in a position
to hand out orders.

1054
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,046
Especially to me.

1055
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:21,018
For now.

1056
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:34,839
Unless, of course,
you think that's just...

1057
01:21:34,873 --> 01:21:37,205
the sound of propaganda
falling out there.

1058
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:50,513
Well, the idea was
to follow Bedford...

1059
01:21:50,556 --> 01:21:52,251
and catch him
on the compound.

1060
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,486
I wanted to drag him back
under the barracks...

1061
01:21:54,526 --> 01:21:55,959
and put his face in the mud.

1062
01:21:56,528 --> 01:21:58,462
Well, by the time
I got to him...

1063
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,465
he was already dead
behind the theater...

1064
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,966
neck had been snapped.

1065
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,490
That's when everything blew up.

1066
01:22:03,535 --> 01:22:06,993
Dogs, you know, hands up,
and that was that.

1067
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:08,870
Lieutenant,
did you apply anything...

1068
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:11,501
to your face or hands
before going out that night?

1069
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:13,774
Shoe polish? Soot?

1070
01:22:13,812 --> 01:22:15,211
No.

1071
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:16,737
Defense exhibit 1, Your Honor.

1072
01:22:17,883 --> 01:22:20,181
Photos of the deceased taken
in the camp morgue.

1073
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,843
The court will note
black smudges...

1074
01:22:22,888 --> 01:22:24,651
on Bedford's right cheek
and jaw.

1075
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,092
Your Honor, what is
the relevance of this?

1076
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,154
To demonstrate to the court...

1077
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,289
that whoever killed
Vic Bedford was white.

1078
01:22:34,933 --> 01:22:36,195
I'd like to ask
the court's permission...

1079
01:22:36,235 --> 01:22:38,362
to conduct a demonstration,
Your Honor.

1080
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:40,963
I'd also ask the trial judge
advocate to rise, if he would.

1081
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,200
Proceed.

1082
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:47,338
Based on Bedford's wounds
and the fact that...

1083
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,540
nobody reported hearing him
cry for help that night...

1084
01:22:49,581 --> 01:22:51,344
we have to assume
that he was either...

1085
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,714
friendly with his assailant...

1086
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:54,946
or that whoever killed him
did so from behind...

1087
01:22:54,987 --> 01:22:56,648
the positioning being
something like this.

1088
01:22:56,688 --> 01:22:58,212
Captain, if you wouldn't mind
grabbing at me...

1089
01:22:58,757 --> 01:23:00,486
at my face
to get me to stop.

1090
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:02,891
Now, of course, the killer
had the benefits...

1091
01:23:02,928 --> 01:23:06,193
of leverage and surprise,
so the neck was snapped...

1092
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:11,265
and Bedford fell,
and the smudge went with him.

1093
01:23:11,603 --> 01:23:13,730
It was also on his fingers.
Captain?

1094
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:18,270
At this time,
I would like the court...

1095
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,800
to note the following
for the record:

1096
01:23:19,845 --> 01:23:21,574
Whoever killed Vic Bedford...

1097
01:23:21,613 --> 01:23:24,081
had such a substance on his face
on the night of the murder...

1098
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,115
which raises 2 questions.

1099
01:23:26,952 --> 01:23:29,580
First, what call
would Lincoln Scott have...

1100
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:31,054
for darkening his face?

1101
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,522
To look more black?

1102
01:23:32,557 --> 01:23:36,254
Second, if he had done so,
when did he take it off?

1103
01:23:36,295 --> 01:23:37,523
Your Honor, you stood
face to face with him...

1104
01:23:37,562 --> 01:23:38,756
immediately
after his capture.

1105
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:39,991
His face was clean.

1106
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:41,992
I think it's fair to conclude...

1107
01:23:42,034 --> 01:23:44,832
that whoever killed Vic Bedford
was not only white...

1108
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:46,997
but was waiting
behind this theater...

1109
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:49,564
face blackened to avoid
detection by the guards.

1110
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:51,706
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1111
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:55,736
Lieutenant, you say that
Sergeant Bedford sneaked out...

1112
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:59,376
through a loose board
beneath the barracks' stove.

1113
01:24:00,686 --> 01:24:01,880
Is that right?

1114
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,418
Yes, sir.

1115
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,485
And you took that same route
on the night in question...

1116
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:11,791
after he'd gone out.

1117
01:24:13,932 --> 01:24:15,160
Yes, I did, sir.

1118
01:24:15,834 --> 01:24:17,495
What did you find down there,
Lieutenant?

1119
01:24:18,236 --> 01:24:19,294
Excuse me, sir?

1120
01:24:19,338 --> 01:24:22,171
What was down there
on the ground?

1121
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,576
Mud, right?

1122
01:24:26,611 --> 01:24:28,806
You stated that it had been
your intention...

1123
01:24:28,847 --> 01:24:30,872
to put the victim's face
in the mud...

1124
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,543
until he begged you to stop...

1125
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:35,075
so there was mud down there,
isn't that right, Lieutenant?

1126
01:24:36,254 --> 01:24:37,448
I suppose so.

1127
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,049
And a fair amount of soot
from the stove itself.

1128
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:43,560
So it's possible
that Sergeant Bedford...

1129
01:24:43,595 --> 01:24:45,995
having descended through
a hole lined with soot...

1130
01:24:46,031 --> 01:24:47,521
and then having crawled
facedown...

1131
01:24:47,566 --> 01:24:50,000
beneath the barracks
wet with mud...

1132
01:24:50,035 --> 01:24:53,562
might have emerged with mud
and soot on his face.

1133
01:24:57,109 --> 01:24:58,269
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1134
01:25:00,879 --> 01:25:02,073
Thank you, Captain Sisk.

1135
01:25:03,382 --> 01:25:04,781
Will you step down, Lieutenant?

1136
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:10,881
Lieutenant Scott?

1137
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:16,789
You know how hard they tried...

1138
01:25:16,828 --> 01:25:21,356
to wash us out of flight
school... the colored flyers?

1139
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:23,500
Your testimony's been entered,
Lieutenant.

1140
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,295
You can step down.

1141
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:26,895
It was test after test.

1142
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:31,772
I mean, anything they
could come up with to turn us...

1143
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:35,439
into the cooks or the drivers
or the shit shovelers.

1144
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,038
Your Honor,
this is highly unnecessary.

1145
01:25:37,082 --> 01:25:40,540
- The witness has already...
- But I refused to wash out.

1146
01:25:40,585 --> 01:25:44,146
So did Archer.
I mean, come hell or high water.

1147
01:25:44,189 --> 01:25:45,486
We hit the books.

1148
01:25:45,524 --> 01:25:47,014
We were just determined...

1149
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:51,017
that we were not going to spend
the war being some niggers.

1150
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:52,962
That's enough, Lieutenant.
You will take your seat.

1151
01:25:52,998 --> 01:25:54,158
With all due respect, sir...

1152
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:57,032
I would like to exercise
my right and address this court.

1153
01:25:57,803 --> 01:26:01,068
Now, I've been sitting down
ever since I got here.

1154
01:26:02,374 --> 01:26:04,535
And you know, I should have
stood up and said something...

1155
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,806
the moment that you threw us in
with the enlisted men...

1156
01:26:06,845 --> 01:26:09,905
instead of quartering us
properly as officers.

1157
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,086
But it's OK.

1158
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:21,391
You see, colored men
expect to have to jump...

1159
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:24,156
through a few hoops
in this man's army.

1160
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:26,960
Archer knew that.
We all did.

1161
01:26:31,336 --> 01:26:37,104
There's a camp right outside
of Macon, where I'm from, and...

1162
01:26:38,543 --> 01:26:41,512
there the army sends
the German POWs...

1163
01:26:43,248 --> 01:26:45,239
puts them to work
picking cotton.

1164
01:26:48,086 --> 01:26:49,713
But what's strange is
every once in a while...

1165
01:26:49,754 --> 01:26:51,779
we'd see them
walking through town...

1166
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:55,421
going to movies,
eating in diners...

1167
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,319
but if I wanted to go
to those same movies...

1168
01:26:58,363 --> 01:27:00,297
I had to sit way off
in the balcony.

1169
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:04,032
And those diners were closed
to me even in uniform.

1170
01:27:04,769 --> 01:27:08,569
But German POWs were allowed
to sit there and eat.

1171
01:27:08,606 --> 01:27:09,732
And this must have happened...

1172
01:27:09,774 --> 01:27:12,242
to at least half the guys
at Tuskegee.

1173
01:27:12,277 --> 01:27:13,403
But the thing is...

1174
01:27:13,445 --> 01:27:17,074
we just kept telling ourselves
that no matter what...

1175
01:27:17,115 --> 01:27:20,243
as long as we did our jobs,
it'd all be worth it...

1176
01:27:20,285 --> 01:27:24,119
because hey, the war would end,
we could go home...

1177
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,919
and be free to walk down
any street in America...

1178
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:30,223
with our heads held high as men.

1179
01:27:32,597 --> 01:27:34,690
So that's what we did.

1180
01:27:34,733 --> 01:27:36,098
We did our jobs.

1181
01:27:40,972 --> 01:27:45,671
We served our country, sir,
Archer and I.

1182
01:27:46,711 --> 01:27:48,440
And what you
let happen to him...

1183
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:52,280
what you allowed to happen
to him...

1184
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,952
was appalling.

1185
01:28:00,925 --> 01:28:02,256
And so is this.

1186
01:28:25,623 --> 01:28:26,647
At ease, Lieutenant.

1187
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,697
How are they treating you?

1188
01:28:38,336 --> 01:28:40,236
No worse than the men
in my barracks, sir.

1189
01:28:44,742 --> 01:28:46,710
I can probably find you
another blanket.

1190
01:28:46,744 --> 01:28:47,802
No. I'm fine.

1191
01:29:05,096 --> 01:29:06,358
Good night.

1192
01:30:33,818 --> 01:30:34,807
New order, gentlemen.

1193
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:38,015
Before you proceed, Your Honor,
the defense hasn't rested yet.

1194
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:39,613
Still like to call
one last witness.

1195
01:30:42,727 --> 01:30:45,719
Defense calls
Oberst Werner Visser.

1196
01:30:49,934 --> 01:30:51,333
This some kind of joke,
Lieutenant?

1197
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:52,859
He's material to our case, sir.

1198
01:30:54,305 --> 01:30:56,500
Unless, of course,
the colonel refuses to testify.

1199
01:30:59,443 --> 01:31:00,535
He does not.

1200
01:31:07,752 --> 01:31:08,741
Colonel, could you tell us...

1201
01:31:08,786 --> 01:31:10,549
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

1202
01:31:11,489 --> 01:31:14,219
I'll be happy to.
I didn't have one.

1203
01:31:14,258 --> 01:31:16,317
And what about your guards,
Colonel?

1204
01:31:17,028 --> 01:31:18,359
Major Fussel, for instance?

1205
01:31:19,363 --> 01:31:21,558
Were you aware of his dealings
with Vic Bedford...

1206
01:31:21,599 --> 01:31:23,760
at night after lockdown?

1207
01:31:24,936 --> 01:31:27,200
That would be impossible
in this camp, Lieutenant.

1208
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:28,262
Policy forbids.

1209
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:32,005
Do you remember
the conversation we had...

1210
01:31:32,043 --> 01:31:33,772
in the camp morgue 4 days ago?

1211
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:36,240
Vaguely.

1212
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,578
I asked you
if you knew Vic Bedford...

1213
01:31:38,616 --> 01:31:42,712
and you said, "No, but my guards
certainly seem to."

1214
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:44,084
Perhaps.

1215
01:31:44,121 --> 01:31:45,486
So, in your words...

1216
01:31:45,523 --> 01:31:47,821
no guard ever traded with
Vic Bedford...

1217
01:31:47,858 --> 01:31:51,021
and yet he was able to acquire
winter boots...

1218
01:31:51,062 --> 01:31:55,021
thick socks, fresh milk,
and parts for a hidden radio.

1219
01:31:55,066 --> 01:31:56,158
Isn't that a fact?

1220
01:31:57,401 --> 01:32:01,235
Lieutenant, I'm sitting here as
a gesture of military courtesy.

1221
01:32:02,406 --> 01:32:05,170
If it is your intention
to paint me as a liar...

1222
01:32:05,209 --> 01:32:06,870
No, Colonel.

1223
01:32:06,911 --> 01:32:08,310
It is my intention
to establish...

1224
01:32:08,346 --> 01:32:10,712
that Vic Bedford built up
enough of a rapport...

1225
01:32:10,748 --> 01:32:13,114
with your majors Wirtz
and Fussel...

1226
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:16,051
to engage in the framing of
Lamar Archer...

1227
01:32:16,087 --> 01:32:17,987
conspiring with them
in the tent spike incident...

1228
01:32:18,022 --> 01:32:20,320
which resulted in
Archer's death.

1229
01:32:20,358 --> 01:32:23,691
Lieutenant Archer was shot
while attempting escape.

1230
01:32:23,728 --> 01:32:24,990
No, Colonel.

1231
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:28,658
Lieutenant Archer was executed
in return for information.

1232
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:31,659
Archer dies.

1233
01:32:32,703 --> 01:32:33,692
Five minutes later...

1234
01:32:33,738 --> 01:32:36,730
Colonel Visser and Major Wirtz
enter Barracks 22...

1235
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,735
and destroy a hidden radio...

1236
01:32:38,776 --> 01:32:40,505
that they had been trying
to locate for months.

1237
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,779
Can you tell the court anything
about these items, sir?

1238
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:55,090
Identification papers,
some currency.

1239
01:32:55,926 --> 01:32:56,915
What of them?

1240
01:32:56,961 --> 01:33:00,488
Perfect German-made I.D. Papers
and reichsmarks.

1241
01:33:01,966 --> 01:33:02,990
Two thousand of them.

1242
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:08,267
More than enough cash to make it
through the country.

1243
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:11,705
Vic Bedford kept those
in a stash beside his bunk.

1244
01:33:11,742 --> 01:33:12,868
Again, can you tell the court...

1245
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:14,673
the nature of your relationship
with Vic Bedford?

1246
01:33:14,712 --> 01:33:16,612
I did not have one, Lieutenant.

1247
01:33:16,647 --> 01:33:17,636
Do you have any idea...

1248
01:33:17,682 --> 01:33:19,582
how he may have gotten
these items, sir?

1249
01:33:20,718 --> 01:33:22,117
If they didn't come from you...

1250
01:33:22,153 --> 01:33:24,587
and if he never had any dealings
with your guards...

1251
01:33:24,622 --> 01:33:25,953
the fact is, Colonel...

1252
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:28,652
Vic Bedford traded with you
and your men regularly.

1253
01:33:28,693 --> 01:33:29,682
Objection, Your Honor!

1254
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:31,695
As soon as he came up dry
on you, you ordered his murder.

1255
01:33:31,729 --> 01:33:33,196
Isn't that right, Colonel?

1256
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:34,254
Lieutenant Hart...

1257
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:38,699
I thought you tried
marvelously...

1258
01:33:38,736 --> 01:33:42,695
to establish that the killer had
blackened his face with soot.

1259
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:46,135
Now, if any of my guards...

1260
01:33:46,177 --> 01:33:49,374
or even I wanted to kill
one of my prisoners...

1261
01:33:49,413 --> 01:33:50,937
Vic Bedford in this case...

1262
01:33:52,149 --> 01:33:55,209
we would hardly need to blacken
our faces to do it.

1263
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:57,745
Would we?

1264
01:36:41,244 --> 01:36:43,576
Move. In the corner, Webb.

1265
01:37:29,459 --> 01:37:30,483
Captain.

1266
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,464
You see?

1267
01:37:45,976 --> 01:37:48,103
German uniforms, explosives.

1268
01:37:49,246 --> 01:37:51,271
Yes, Captain, I see.

1269
01:37:52,282 --> 01:37:54,443
The trial's got nothing to do
with Lincoln Scott, does it?

1270
01:37:55,485 --> 01:37:56,509
No.

1271
01:37:57,587 --> 01:37:58,815
It's the way it had to go.

1272
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,450
We're out of time, Hart.

1273
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:04,123
We lose this theater tomorrow.

1274
01:38:04,161 --> 01:38:06,823
Uh-huh, and I'm supposed to keep
Visser and his men distracted...

1275
01:38:06,863 --> 01:38:07,955
while half the camp goes out.

1276
01:38:08,765 --> 01:38:10,130
Is that it, Captain?

1277
01:38:14,938 --> 01:38:16,269
I'm asking
the wrong fucking guy.

1278
01:38:33,623 --> 01:38:34,954
I've just seen the tunnel,
Colonel.

1279
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:42,488
In here, Lieutenant.

1280
01:39:01,418 --> 01:39:03,477
Everything in this place
is a lie.

1281
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,544
Everything.

1282
01:39:12,128 --> 01:39:13,152
Jesus Christ.

1283
01:39:16,233 --> 01:39:18,030
First he told the Germans
about the radio.

1284
01:39:19,603 --> 01:39:20,592
It was only a matter of time...

1285
01:39:20,637 --> 01:39:22,002
before he told them about
the tunnel.

1286
01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:27,634
You killed Bedford.

1287
01:39:31,781 --> 01:39:32,805
That's right.

1288
01:39:41,124 --> 01:39:44,093
If you fuck with this operation
in any way, I'll kill you, too.

1289
01:39:48,965 --> 01:39:50,432
You will sit in
that courtroom...

1290
01:39:50,467 --> 01:39:52,731
as Captain Sisk drags out
these proceedings.

1291
01:39:54,471 --> 01:39:57,372
Make whatever summation
you like, but that's it.

1292
01:39:59,142 --> 01:40:01,110
When that board breaks
to deliberate,

1293
01:40:01,144 --> 01:40:02,771
35 men go under the wire.

1294
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:04,370
And Lincoln Scott will be dead.

1295
01:40:04,414 --> 01:40:05,403
That's war, Lieutenant.

1296
01:40:05,448 --> 01:40:07,109
The war's at the front, Colonel.
We're not even in it anymore.

1297
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:08,174
Speak for yourself!

1298
01:40:11,154 --> 01:40:12,143
You know those Russians...

1299
01:40:12,188 --> 01:40:13,280
they march in and out of here
every day?

1300
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:15,921
- You know where they go?
- Munitions plant.

1301
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:18,257
The army thinks
it's a goddamn shoe factory.

1302
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:24,791
Look...

1303
01:40:25,735 --> 01:40:27,896
I don't want to see Scott dead
any more than you do.

1304
01:40:28,972 --> 01:40:30,667
But if one man
has to be sacrificed...

1305
01:40:30,707 --> 01:40:31,696
to take out that target...

1306
01:40:31,741 --> 01:40:33,231
then that's the way
it has to be.

1307
01:40:33,276 --> 01:40:35,369
- I agree completely, sir.
- Good.

1308
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:39,442
But I think that one man
should be you.

1309
01:40:41,451 --> 01:40:42,941
And don't worry.
I'll play my part.

1310
01:40:42,986 --> 01:40:44,476
But at the end of the trial...

1311
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:46,989
you're going to tap
your little gavel.

1312
01:40:47,023 --> 01:40:48,047
You're going to stand up...

1313
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:49,683
and you're going to confess to
the murder.

1314
01:40:49,726 --> 01:40:51,159
Your duty demands that.

1315
01:40:51,194 --> 01:40:52,320
Fuck you, Hart.

1316
01:40:52,362 --> 01:40:54,796
What the fuck would you know
about duty?

1317
01:40:57,467 --> 01:40:59,264
I'll see you in court, sir.

1318
01:41:21,257 --> 01:41:22,485
I got a better question.

1319
01:41:22,525 --> 01:41:24,288
What was in that goddamn soup
last night?

1320
01:41:24,327 --> 01:41:26,124
I got 20 men
with food poisoning.

1321
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,866
Colonel? Whoa! Colonel!

1322
01:41:42,545 --> 01:41:44,069
You're in no shape
for the trial, sir.

1323
01:41:44,748 --> 01:41:46,773
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

1324
01:41:47,617 --> 01:41:48,641
Here we go.

1325
01:41:49,786 --> 01:41:52,050
We'll convene as scheduled
after the appell.

1326
01:41:52,956 --> 01:41:53,980
Square 'em up.

1327
01:41:56,126 --> 01:41:59,357
Prisoners, attention!

1328
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:04,928
New order, gentlemen.

1329
01:42:04,968 --> 01:42:05,992
Captain Sisk...

1330
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:10,837
is the prosecution ready
to present its summation?

1331
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:11,898
We are, Your Honor.

1332
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:14,133
Very well.

1333
01:42:25,255 --> 01:42:26,381
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

1334
01:42:26,423 --> 01:42:29,620
The court needs a 5-minute
recess before summations.

1335
01:42:31,428 --> 01:42:33,020
Colonel. Colonel!

1336
01:42:33,062 --> 01:42:35,189
Colonel? Colonel!

1337
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:37,392
Let's get him back
to the barracks.

1338
01:42:37,434 --> 01:42:38,526
Get his coat.

1339
01:42:38,568 --> 01:42:40,092
Get some rest, sir.

1340
01:42:40,136 --> 01:42:43,572
All right, come on.
Get back to the barracks.

1341
01:42:43,606 --> 01:42:45,437
We need an extension, Colonel.
He's very ill.

1342
01:42:46,443 --> 01:42:48,035
The agreement was
the end of the week.

1343
01:42:48,077 --> 01:42:49,567
It's a matter of courtesy,
Colonel.

1344
01:42:49,612 --> 01:42:51,580
The agreement was today!

1345
01:42:56,786 --> 01:42:57,810
I need to talk to you.

1346
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:15,631
Are you any good at poker,
Lincoln?

1347
01:43:17,574 --> 01:43:20,236
There's an escape going to take
place later on this afternoon.

1348
01:43:21,544 --> 01:43:23,375
Escape? How's that?

1349
01:43:25,048 --> 01:43:28,040
Down a tunnel through
that burned theater wing.

1350
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:31,913
While the jury's
in deliberation.

1351
01:43:35,692 --> 01:43:37,853
So what you mean?
This whole thing's been a joke?

1352
01:43:37,894 --> 01:43:39,953
Yes.

1353
01:43:39,996 --> 01:43:43,159
But Archer and Bedford
are dead for real.

1354
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,292
Is that part
of this big joke, too?

1355
01:43:45,335 --> 01:43:47,895
Look, we haven't got time now.

1356
01:43:47,937 --> 01:43:50,064
During deliberations you're
going out under the wire...

1357
01:43:50,106 --> 01:43:52,370
with 35 other men.

1358
01:43:52,408 --> 01:43:54,467
Is McNamara, too?

1359
01:43:55,845 --> 01:43:58,279
Yeah, McNamara, too.

1360
01:44:02,051 --> 01:44:05,282
It's funny.
I was just writing my son...

1361
01:44:05,321 --> 01:44:07,789
and in the letter I was
trying to explain to him...

1362
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:11,555
what the word honor means.

1363
01:44:13,296 --> 01:44:15,491
It would be a hell of a thing,
wouldn't it...

1364
01:44:15,532 --> 01:44:18,899
to find out that your father
helped 35 men...

1365
01:44:18,935 --> 01:44:20,835
escape from a place
like this, wouldn't it?

1366
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:23,839
You're going out, too, Lincoln.
You got that?

1367
01:44:25,241 --> 01:44:27,334
I can't do that, Tommy.

1368
01:44:28,778 --> 01:44:31,576
Suppose the board comes back...

1369
01:44:31,614 --> 01:44:34,310
and there's nobody sitting in
the defendant's chair anymore.

1370
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,647
It doesn't matter.
You'll already be out.

1371
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:37,710
Then the search begins...

1372
01:44:37,754 --> 01:44:41,087
and all those men,
they won't have a chance.

1373
01:44:41,124 --> 01:44:43,115
Lincoln, if you stay,
you'll be convicted.

1374
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:46,839
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

1375
01:44:46,839 --> 01:44:47,601
If I stay, those men
are gonna have a chance.

1376
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:49,574
And you'll be executed.

1377
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:56,313
Lincoln, listen to me, please.

1378
01:44:56,349 --> 01:44:59,250
Everything's fine, Tommy.

1379
01:44:59,285 --> 01:45:01,048
Everything's really OK...

1380
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,419
just as long as he knows
what happened here.

1381
01:45:08,861 --> 01:45:11,329
As long as there's
somebody to tell him.

1382
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:20,265
How far could I get anyway?

1383
01:45:20,306 --> 01:45:24,037
A colored man running through
the German countryside?

1384
01:45:24,076 --> 01:45:25,941
It'd be target practice.

1385
01:45:51,704 --> 01:45:53,729
It started with a noble idea.

1386
01:45:55,708 --> 01:45:58,142
Letting colored men
join the fight.

1387
01:45:59,545 --> 01:46:02,673
But no one in the Air Corps ever
considered what might happen...

1388
01:46:02,715 --> 01:46:05,741
if one of those Tuskegee men
ever got shot down.

1389
01:46:07,019 --> 01:46:08,919
No one ever asked
what would happen...

1390
01:46:08,954 --> 01:46:11,388
if a colored officer
was suddenly captured...

1391
01:46:11,424 --> 01:46:13,949
and sent to a stalag
like this one.

1392
01:46:15,127 --> 01:46:20,588
But Lincoln Scott was shot down
and he was sent to a stalag...

1393
01:46:20,633 --> 01:46:22,863
and once here,
he wasn't just thrown in...

1394
01:46:22,902 --> 01:46:26,429
amongst white enlisted men,
he was quartered with them.

1395
01:46:26,472 --> 01:46:28,838
Men like Staff Sergeant
Vic Bedford.

1396
01:46:28,874 --> 01:46:32,776
Bedford, the real Bedford,
was a man unknown to us.

1397
01:46:32,812 --> 01:46:37,772
Hateful, vengeful, with
a bigotry that ran bone-deep.

1398
01:46:39,485 --> 01:46:42,045
A man who simply couldn't
stomach the thought...

1399
01:46:42,088 --> 01:46:45,683
of sharing a roof
with colored officers.

1400
01:46:45,725 --> 01:46:47,989
So he badgered Scott,
baited him.

1401
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:50,996
Even refused
to respect Scott's rank.

1402
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:55,660
Then conspired to kill the only
friend Scott had in this camp.

1403
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:58,169
That's why Scott
followed Bedford out...

1404
01:46:58,204 --> 01:46:59,569
the night in question...

1405
01:46:59,605 --> 01:47:03,507
crept up behind him
and snapped his neck.

1406
01:47:04,844 --> 01:47:06,641
Members of the board,
we take no pleasure...

1407
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:09,147
in prosecuting
Lieutenant Scott...

1408
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:10,978
but a capital charge requires...

1409
01:47:11,016 --> 01:47:14,110
that we put aside
our passions and sympathies...

1410
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:18,089
wedding ourselves
solely to the truth.

1411
01:47:18,124 --> 01:47:19,751
It is this.

1412
01:47:19,792 --> 01:47:21,589
Lieutenant Scott
was positively...

1413
01:47:21,627 --> 01:47:24,152
and unimpeachably identified
at the scene of the crime.

1414
01:47:24,196 --> 01:47:27,131
He had motive,
he had opportunity...

1415
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:29,157
and he had an animus
for the victim...

1416
01:47:29,201 --> 01:47:32,170
which was confirmed
even by his own testimony.

1417
01:47:34,173 --> 01:47:39,042
Lincoln Scott is an officer,
he is a soldier...

1418
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:40,705
but he is also a murderer.

1419
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:10,803
There's a tenet that was
drummed into all of us...

1420
01:48:10,843 --> 01:48:12,640
from our first day in basic.

1421
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:15,974
Sometimes 1 man
must be sacrificed...

1422
01:48:16,015 --> 01:48:18,347
for the good
of the men around him.

1423
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:20,875
Someone has to be first
to hit the beach...

1424
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:25,050
or to jump on a grenade
or to draw enemy fire...

1425
01:48:25,090 --> 01:48:27,854
so coordinates can be drawn
for mortar teams.

1426
01:48:27,893 --> 01:48:30,657
Vic Bedford
learned that tenet, too...

1427
01:48:30,696 --> 01:48:33,028
except Vic got it backwards.

1428
01:48:33,065 --> 01:48:35,556
Vic thought that sometimes
a few hundred...

1429
01:48:35,601 --> 01:48:37,762
must be sacrificed
for the good of 1.

1430
01:48:39,238 --> 01:48:41,502
Him. For Vic.

1431
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:43,735
The watchword was expediency.

1432
01:48:43,776 --> 01:48:45,641
One day he'd trade
with our captors...

1433
01:48:45,678 --> 01:48:48,169
to get hard-to-find parts
for a radio...

1434
01:48:48,214 --> 01:48:50,273
earning him the loyalty
of our commanding officer...

1435
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:51,681
and his staff.

1436
01:48:51,717 --> 01:48:54,083
Then Vic would tell the Germans
where to find that radio...

1437
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:55,279
Go.

1438
01:48:55,321 --> 01:48:57,551
In exchange for the murder
of Lamar Archer.

1439
01:48:59,725 --> 01:49:01,784
The army has its share
of cowards...

1440
01:49:03,929 --> 01:49:05,829
and Vic Bedford was one of them.

1441
01:49:05,865 --> 01:49:09,995
It also has heroes...
soldiers like Lincoln Scott.

1442
01:49:10,035 --> 01:49:13,198
Lincoln Scott who wanted nothing
more than to serve his country.

1443
01:49:13,239 --> 01:49:14,866
And serve he did.

1444
01:49:14,907 --> 01:49:18,001
Nine downed German fighters,
30 missions...

1445
01:49:18,043 --> 01:49:22,173
until one of those missions
landed him here, Stalag 6A...

1446
01:49:22,214 --> 01:49:25,308
where Vic Bedford and the sad
sacks Bedford called friends...

1447
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:27,114
were lying in wait.

1448
01:49:27,152 --> 01:49:30,553
Scott was a target
from the second he got here.

1449
01:49:30,589 --> 01:49:35,219
He suffered insults, threats,
but he did not retaliate.

1450
01:49:35,261 --> 01:49:39,698
He did not kill Vic Bedford.

1451
01:49:39,732 --> 01:49:41,359
No.

1452
01:49:42,568 --> 01:49:43,728
Someone beat him to it.

1453
01:49:46,372 --> 01:49:48,932
It could've been
any number of people.

1454
01:49:48,974 --> 01:49:52,535
The guard who thought
that Bedford had cheated him.

1455
01:49:52,578 --> 01:49:55,513
A fellow kriegie who discovered
Bedford's treachery.

1456
01:49:55,547 --> 01:49:56,912
Even one of our
ranking officers...

1457
01:49:56,949 --> 01:49:58,974
as punishment for
ratting out that radio.

1458
01:49:59,018 --> 01:50:01,282
So this, then, is our victim?

1459
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:06,019
A bigot. A traitor. A rat.

1460
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:08,390
Enemy of every kriegie in camp.

1461
01:50:10,329 --> 01:50:13,856
The question is, who hated him
enough to kill him?

1462
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:20,070
Colonel.

1463
01:50:28,013 --> 01:50:29,207
I did.

1464
01:50:33,786 --> 01:50:35,981
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1465
01:50:36,021 --> 01:50:38,114
I killed Vic Bedford, sir.

1466
01:50:40,192 --> 01:50:42,285
Come on, Colonel. Here.

1467
01:50:45,064 --> 01:50:47,794
I want every man in the compound
present...

1468
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:49,892
for the execution
of Lieutenant Hart.

1469
01:50:52,237 --> 01:50:55,502
Very brave.
Very brave, indeed.

1470
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:56,633
Colonel, this man has rights.

1471
01:50:56,675 --> 01:50:57,699
Not anymore.

1472
01:50:57,743 --> 01:50:59,335
This court still has to
deliberate the matter.

1473
01:50:59,378 --> 01:51:00,640
I am the court now!

1474
01:51:00,679 --> 01:51:02,442
Now. Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

1475
01:51:10,022 --> 01:51:11,580
Get out.

1476
01:53:26,358 --> 01:53:27,825
I want every man...

1477
01:53:27,859 --> 01:53:29,622
who participated
in the court-martial...

1478
01:53:29,661 --> 01:53:31,561
removed from the line.

1479
01:53:36,902 --> 01:53:38,335
Line them up.

1480
01:53:39,037 --> 01:53:40,937
Line them up. Now.

1481
01:53:40,972 --> 01:53:42,872
These men knew nothing, Colonel.

1482
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:46,243
Line them up!

1483
01:53:48,246 --> 01:53:49,213
You will be the first.

1484
01:53:49,247 --> 01:53:50,578
These men knew nothing.

1485
01:53:50,615 --> 01:53:52,378
You will be the first!

1486
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:53,884
Colonel, they knew nothing!

1487
01:55:16,435 --> 01:55:20,030
So, your men are saboteurs
as well?

1488
01:55:20,071 --> 01:55:23,268
No, Colonel,
they're just soldiers.

1489
01:55:23,308 --> 01:55:25,333
They were following my orders.

1490
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:28,505
I assume complete
responsibility.

1491
01:55:31,183 --> 01:55:33,447
That's very noble of you.

1492
01:55:42,894 --> 01:55:46,193
Seems you've won our duel
after all, Colonel.

1493
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,592
No.

1494
01:55:52,671 --> 01:55:56,004
We both lose, don't we?

1495
01:55:58,844 --> 01:56:00,243
Yeah.

1496
01:56:03,515 --> 01:56:08,578
And now you wish to
trade your life for theirs?

1497
01:56:17,496 --> 01:56:19,293
Yes, I do.

1498
01:56:53,064 --> 01:56:54,759
Very well.

1499
01:59:25,183 --> 01:59:28,949
We buried the Colonel in
a marked grave behind the camp.

1500
01:59:28,986 --> 01:59:31,648
Three months later,
the German army surrendered.

1501
01:59:31,689 --> 01:59:34,249
Our stalag was liberated.

1502
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,351
The war was over.

1503
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:41,889
We returned home to America,
to our families.

1504
01:59:41,933 --> 01:59:43,423
Lincoln Scott got the chance...

1505
01:59:43,468 --> 01:59:46,266
to explain the word honor
to his son.

1506
01:59:46,304 --> 01:59:52,174
Honor and courage,
duty, sacrifice.

1507
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:55,646
Lincoln's son came
to understand those words...

1508
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:57,170
and so have I.
