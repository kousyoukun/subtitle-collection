1
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,913
I certainly hope you dance
as well as you dress.

2
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,583
There's only one way to find out.

3
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,147
Do you do the whirlybird?

4
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,149
Must you even ask?

5
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:10,005
Don't you know who I am?

6
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,256
No.

7
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,217
But I'd like to find out.

8
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,887
How I wish you were here
to capture my heart,

9
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,016
not simply to capture me, Agent Argylle.

10
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,491
I guess the whirlybird
doesn't catch the worm.

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,210
Any last words?

12
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,178
A little help, Keira?

13
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,763
Who's Keira?

14
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,893
The girl who gave up being the next
Steve Jobs to save his sorry ass.

15
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,812
<i>You're welcome.</i>

16
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,704
Need a lift?

17
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,956
Legrange made me.
She knew exactly who I was.

18
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,208
Well, then let's get the hell outta here.

19
00:03:59,031 --> 00:03:59,948
Keira!

20
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,659
She's hit. Keira's down.

21
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,744
<i>Sending medevac.</i>

22
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,330
You need to stay on target, Argylle.

23
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,915
<i>No, I can save her.</i>

24
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,375
Let medevac do their job. You do yours.

25
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,544
<i>That's an order.</i>

26
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,079
Wyatt, I lost her.

27
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,415
<i>What's your status?</i>

28
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,377
I'm about to enjoy
a delicious Greek coffee.

29
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,337
Well, I suggest you hurry up.

30
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,214
<i>She's inbound to your position.</i>

31
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,133
Relax.

32
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,779
Bad news for you,

33
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,282
this is the only exit route
off the island.

34
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,367
The good news?

35
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,536
This place makes phenomenal karydopita.

36
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,750
I hope you like it.

37
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,045
Because it's about to be your last meal

38
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,631
unless you tell us who told you
that we were coming.

39
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,509
Who?

40
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
You don't answer,

41
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,930
you're gonna be the same temperature
as my coffee right now.

42
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,058
Which, thanks to you, is ice-cold.

43
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,559
Phone.

44
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,364
You and I, we're not so different.

45
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,115
You're a terrorist.

46
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,161
Then what, Agent Argylle,
does that make you?

47
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,626
Argylle.

48
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,010
Be advised, Legrange,

49
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,639
Agent Argylle is en route
to your location now.

50
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,231
It seems we serve the same master.

51
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,002
<i>Argylle, Wyatt, complete your mission
and return to base.</i>

52
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,045
<i>Argylle.</i>

53
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,255
Cut your feed.

54
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,673
<i>Think clearly.</i>

55
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,092
<i>Use your head.</i>

56
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,011
<i>You can't believe a goddamn word she sa--</i>

57
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,103
We're on our own now.

58
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,607
The Directorate will come after us.

59
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,607
The Directorate will come after us.

60
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,194
-So we go dark. Off the grid.
-"'<i>So we go dark. Off the grid.</i>'

61
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,862
-Fully.
-'<i>Fully.</i>'

62
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,283
-We trust each other...
-'We trust each other and no one else.'

63
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,952
'You understand me?'

64
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:21,919
'From this moment forward, it's
a whole new ball game,' warned Argylle.

65
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,964
For he knew there was no turning back.

66
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:31,845
That nothing would ever
be the same again."

67
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,477
Elly Conway, ladies and gentlemen.
All right.

68
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,357
{\an8}Thank you. Thank you.

69
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,651
Okay, and now let's take some questions.

70
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,110
So-- Yes?

71
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,488
-Hi, Elly.
-Hi. Hi.

72
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:53,534
I'm actually an aspiring writer,
but I can never seem to find the time.

73
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,452
Do you have any advice?

74
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,622
Oh, my goodness,
I know how hard that can be.

75
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,252
For me, when I was a waitress,
I was juggling so many shifts.

76
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,252
For me, when I was a waitress,
I was juggling so many shifts.

77
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:07,714
I never had the time to really write
until the-- well, the--

78
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,593
the skating accident,
which I've obviously spoken about.

79
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:15,264
And I think when something like that
happens to you,

80
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,100
it makes you realize
that tomorrow isn't promised.

81
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,227
And that if you can't find the time,

82
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,481
you have to make the time to do the things
that are important to you.

83
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,902
And once I did that, all the characters
and stories and ideas

84
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,489
that had been trapped in my head
for so many years

85
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,992
finally got let out onto the page.

86
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,870
All right, let's take another question.

87
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,079
Yeah?

88
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,415
-Hello.
-Hello.

89
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,002
It's no secret that you are
the spy novelist actual spies read.

90
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,380
You have even predicted
real-life geopolitical events.

91
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,218
Fleming, Forsyth, le CarrÃ©,

92
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,513
they all had the same touch
and they turned out to be real spies.

93
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,432
So, what?

94
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,559
Are you a spy too?

95
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,559
Are you a spy too?

96
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,811
How do you do it?

97
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,397
Gosh, I wish. I wish.

98
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,526
That would make everything so much easier,
but no.

99
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,907
As boring as it may seem, the secret is
research, research, research.

100
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,455
Although, that is what I would say
if I was a real spy, so...

101
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,625
Okay, next question.

102
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,251
Yes? Young lady down in front.

103
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,587
When are we gonna get book five?

104
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,547
Well.

105
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,382
Sooner than you think.

106
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,176
Very exciting.

107
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,886
Yeah? The gentleman in the gray hoodie.

108
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,263
Sorry if this sounds a bit forward,

109
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,141
but I don't know
if I'll ever get another chance to ask,

110
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,519
so, do you have any plans tonight?

111
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,270
That's--

112
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,357
That's very flattering.

113
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,403
But tonight I actually do have a hot date.

114
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,168
Yep. Another hot date.

115
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,832
You ready?

116
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,379
Mama's got to get to work.

117
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,595
The stolen master file

118
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,890
held more than enough proof

119
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,475
to bring the Directorate down.

120
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,940
<i>Although the hacker's price was high,</i>

121
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,986
<i>Argylle knew that it would be
worth its weight in gold.</i>

122
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,405
Half now, half on delivery.

123
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,325
As discussed.

124
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,039
This phone is the key to the master file.

125
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,209
Go to London.

126
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:34,087
Once you've arrived, you'll receive a call
on that phone from my employer,

127
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,340
the world's greatest hacker.

128
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:44,681
<i>Finally in reach of the silver bullet</i>

129
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,227
which would destroy the Directorate

130
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,980
once and for all.

131
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,985
The end.

132
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,869
Book five finished.

133
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,287
Cheers, Argylle.

134
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,808
Mom, morning. Hi.

135
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,977
Did you see my email
I sent you last night?

136
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,353
I read it.

137
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,939
Overnight? The whole thing?

138
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,400
Sweetie, I'm your mother. Of course I did.

139
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,736
I took two Adderall, started,
couldn't put it down.

140
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,363
I was blown away.

141
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,990
You did it again, angel.

142
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,324
Mom, I'm so relieved.

143
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,245
I was going over and over it
in my head and stressing

144
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,914
and I'm just glad you like it, honestly.

145
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,166
<i>Now we can get it out to the publisher
and just--</i>

146
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,877
Right. Well...

147
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,545
Oh, no.

148
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,589
What?

149
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,759
<i>Nothing. The book is phenomenal,
sweetie, but--</i>

150
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,759
<i>Nothing. The book is phenomenal,
sweetie, but--</i>

151
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,180
You don't think it's ready.

152
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,016
Elly, it's just-- It's the ending.

153
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,726
-Oh, God.
-<i>I'm reading this thing.</i>

154
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,019
<i>I'm on the edge of my toilet.</i>

155
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,939
Argylle about to get the master file,
defeat those SOBs,

156
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,274
<i>and then the big twist is</i>

157
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,775
it's in London.

158
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:22,196
<i>What? No. No, no, no.</i>

159
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,198
Does he get the file or not?

160
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,783
-What happens next?
-It's called a cliff-hanger, Mother.

161
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,619
Elly, it's called a cop-out.

162
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,580
<i>And you can't do this to your readers.</i>

163
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,624
<i>How about I fly in on Friday?</i>

164
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,417
<i>Make a weekend of it.</i>

165
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,920
<i>Brainstorm, work a little bit
of our magic?</i>

166
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,463
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>

167
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,302
Friday's fine. I'll just--

168
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,179
I'll futz around with it until then.

169
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,640
You need to bring this story home, Elly.

170
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:54,811
Yeah, I think you have one more
teeny tiny chapter to write.

171
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,605
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

172
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,316
<i>Bye.</i>

173
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,029
You hear that, buddy?

174
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,949
One more chapter.

175
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,868
<i>Miss Li,</i>

176
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,539
the next flight to London
doesn't leave until morning.

177
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,876
Seeing as I have time to kill,

178
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,504
-I thought...
-Thought what?

179
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,215
That I'd stay here?

180
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,175
Enjoy the fireworks with you?

181
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,437
I'll show you fireworks.

182
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,956
No.

183
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,375
That was bad.

184
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,460
God, that was bad.

185
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,460
God, that was bad.

186
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,296
Delete.

187
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,006
You're better than this, Elly.

188
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,091
Come on, Elly.

189
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,053
-The whole tone--
-Is just--

190
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,471
It's way off.

191
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,223
Okay.

192
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:19,188
"What I meant to say, Miss Li, was"...

193
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,780
What I meant to say, Miss Li, was...

194
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,283
"Was"...

195
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,055
-I've got n--
-Nothing.

196
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,232
What about you, Alfie?

197
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,651
Any thoughts?

198
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,694
Anything?

199
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,452
Hey, Mom.

200
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,247
<i>Hi, dear. Just wanna make sure
you're okay.</i>

201
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,290
I know how stressed you get
with work and--

202
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,125
Tickets, please. Tickets.

203
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,877
Wait, Elly.

204
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,462
Are you on a train?

205
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,798
Surprise.

206
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,175
<i>I figured I'd just come down to the city
to see you.</i>

207
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,053
Well, your father will be so excited
to see you.

208
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,097
<i>And dear little Alfie, of course.</i>

209
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,849
We'll take you out for a nice dinner.

210
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,643
Maybe you'll even meet someone
while you're here, who knows?

211
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:44,898
As appealing as that sounds, Mother,
I am in a relationship.

212
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,608
You are?

213
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,818
<i>With who?</i>

214
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,945
A relationship with my work.

215
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,739
With Argylle.

216
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,783
<i>It kills me, Elly.</i>

217
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:58,161
What is the point of success
if you have no one to enjoy it with?

218
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,082
There's a reason I write about spies,
not romance, Mother.

219
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,082
There's a reason I write about spies,
not romance, Mother.

220
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,294
It's less complicated.

221
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,920
-<i>What's so complicated...</i>
-Yeah.

222
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,297
<i>...about falling in love, Elly?</i>

223
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,465
I'll call you when I get in, yeah?

224
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,176
Love you. Bye.

225
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,427
Hi.

226
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,638
Sorry to disturb. Is this seat taken?

227
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,724
Is that seat taken?

228
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,357
Yes. Yes, unfortunately, it is.

229
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:29,985
That's a shame.

230
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:49,421
I'm sorry, no. No. That seat is taken.

231
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,799
He got up, but a man was--

232
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,052
is sitting there.

233
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,471
That's fine. If he comes back,
I'll just get up.

234
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,516
Hey! There's a cat in there.

235
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,516
Hey! There's a cat in there.

236
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,851
This cat's supposed to be in a hat,
not in a backpack.

237
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,394
Look at this.

238
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,022
What are you doing, fur monster? Far out.

239
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,067
I love cats. What's his name?

240
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,403
-Excuse me.
-Alfie.

241
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,948
Alfie boy. Ooh, yeah.

242
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,617
Coochy-coochy-coochy-coochy-coo.

243
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,204
Is enough oxygen in there?

244
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,330
Yes, of course.

245
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,046
I'll leave you alone.
You wanna be left alone. I understand.

246
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,550
Have you read this?

247
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,721
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

248
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,807
Okay.

249
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,602
I get it. Okay.

250
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,123
{\an8}Wait--

251
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,422
Excuse me.

252
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,925
Oh, my God. Are you-- Is this?

253
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,219
You're Elly freaking Conway.

254
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,762
Far out!

255
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,016
How about that?

256
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,686
I am such a fan,
and this is honest to God your best yet.

257
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,770
I'm not just saying that.

258
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,355
How do you do it?

259
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,649
Book after book,
you just crank 'em out, man.

260
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,195
You know, when you're passionate
about what you do...

261
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,989
You never work a day in your life.

262
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,532
Ain't that the truth?

263
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,452
We're both lucky that way, you and I.

264
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,704
Oh, yeah? What is it you do?

265
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,372
Espionage.

266
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,167
Right.

267
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,213
"The greater the spy, the bigger the lie."

268
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,381
That's cheeky.

269
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,136
Not what you expected
a spy to look like, huh?

270
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,136
Not what you expected
a spy to look like, huh?

271
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,557
Well, yeah, in fairness, that is just
about the only thing your books get wrong.

272
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:09,520
A male model in a bespoke Nehru jacket
with a stupid haircut

273
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:14,191
tends to stand out on a train
as opposed to everyone else in this car.

274
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,155
Them you don't notice.

275
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,409
Have I lost you?

276
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,037
You all right?

277
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,250
No, I'm fine.

278
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,919
You know, I meant it
when I said I was a fan.

279
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,379
But the next fan that comes over,

280
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,965
he's not just dropping by for a selfie,
if you catch my drift.

281
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,299
He's one of them.

282
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,885
-Now, I realize this may be...
-...hard to believe,

283
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,762
but by the time I've broken his wrists...

284
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,472
...and his pistol falls into your lap,

285
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,641
perhaps we will have built up
a little trust with one another...

286
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,143
...and you'll be able to accept
two key realities.

287
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:53,647
Reality one, you are in grave danger.

288
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,650
-Reality...
-...two, when I say it's time,

289
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,153
it would really be beneficial for you
to hold on to me as tight as you can.

290
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,153
it would really be beneficial for you
to hold on to me as tight as you can.

291
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,071
I'm talking...

292
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,616
...bear-hug-like-you've-
never-held-anyone-before tight.

293
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,286
You understand?

294
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,246
You dig what I'm saying?

295
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,083
I am so sorry.

296
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,170
Miss Conway,
would you mind signing my book?

297
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,921
We're really gonna play this game?

298
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,006
Yeah.

299
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,674
Do you have a pen?

300
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,634
-It's embarrassing.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

301
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,555
Here we go.

302
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,809
God, I love this book.

303
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,200
See? I was telling the truth.

304
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,410
Who's the weirdo now?

305
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,540
Not a real fan. Don't worry.
I have it all under control.

306
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,251
I got everything under control.

307
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,311
What is happening?

308
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:18,941
Are you okay?

309
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,275
Yeah.

310
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,737
Gee, that's nice. Thanks.

311
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:08,615
See?

312
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:11,285
I give you the gun,
you give it back to me.

313
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,287
This is that trust
we were talking about, Elly.

314
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,330
Strangers on a train.

315
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,540
And now look at us.

316
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,584
Come on. Isn't this fun?

317
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,261
Wait a second. No, no, no.

318
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,847
Elly, hold on. Don't do that.

319
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:55,913
Elly!

320
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,763
It's a real beard, you dick.

321
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,641
Hey, hey, hey.

322
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,739
You okay?

323
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,074
No!

324
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,825
Okay, I'm gonna take care of this.

325
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,749
Okay, this could be a challenging--

326
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:08,735
Okay.

327
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,417
All right, I think it's
bear hug o'clock time. Follow me.

328
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,501
Let's go.

329
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,505
Okay. Hey, stay with me. Follow me.

330
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,590
Okay.

331
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,009
Let's go.

332
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,677
-Hey.
-No. Bad.

333
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,137
Bad. Very bad.

334
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:36,930
Let's go. Let's go.

335
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,942
-Hey, wait. That's your type?
-Get lost, Romeo.

336
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,027
No!

337
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,323
Freeze!

338
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,283
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Don't shoot.

339
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,702
I don't know this man.
I have nothing to do with this person.

340
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,037
I'm not involved. Please.

341
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,037
I'm not involved. Please.

342
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,914
Wilde, don't make me kill both of you.

343
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,207
Hey, Elly.

344
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,125
What?

345
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,543
It's time.

346
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,712
It's bear hug o'clock.

347
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,506
Enjoy the ride.

348
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,886
Yeah!

349
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,555
Okay!

350
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,117
What?

351
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,589
Good, you're up. Hey.

352
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,469
Okay, it's me. It's just me.

353
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,889
Remember the guy on the train?
The kung fu--

354
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,889
Remember the guy on the train?
The kung fu--

355
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,057
With the beard?

356
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,268
I shaved.

357
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,894
The guy from the train. Yeah, remember?

358
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:08,188
I know. I recognize you.

359
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,359
I'm sorry. I'm being rude. I apologize.

360
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:15,654
We haven't been formally introduced.
My name's Aidan. Aidan Wilde.

361
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,947
No, no, no! Stay back.

362
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,116
Okay. Relax.

363
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:21,493
Where's my cat?

364
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,330
Alfie's right over there in the kitchen
eating mercury-free tuna.

365
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,833
Just like Mom feeds him.

366
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,460
He's fine. You're not.

367
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,754
You're in big, big trouble.

368
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:35,174
You...

369
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,385
You have cameras in my house?

370
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,679
You're not a spy, you're a pervert.

371
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,890
No, not a pervert. A spy.

372
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,184
I'm a spy, doing my job.
I'm not a pervert.

373
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,644
That's the bad guys' feed
that we're tapped into.

374
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,190
Well, then, who are these people?

375
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,025
You see that guy right there?

376
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,235
<i>You remember him from the train?</i>

377
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,987
<i>His name's Carlos.</i>

378
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,780
<i>He works for the Division,</i>

379
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:02,993
<i>the real-life version
of those bad-guy spies in your books.</i>

380
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:02,993
<i>the real-life version
of those bad-guy spies in your books.</i>

381
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:07,039
<i>And the head honcho.
He's called Director Ritter.</i>

382
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,252
Do I need to remind you
what is at stake here?

383
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:20,093
What would happen if that turncoat
son of a bitch masquerading as an agent

384
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,638
were to recover our master file
before we do?

385
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,557
I'll find her. You have my word.

386
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,017
Deputy Director,

387
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,979
is that like when you gave me your word

388
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:34,107
Wilde would never get
within a hundred miles from her?

389
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,694
We can still contain this, sir.

390
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,405
I'm overwhelmed with confidence.

391
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,869
<i>No, this doesn't make sense.
Why would the Division care about me?</i>

392
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:48,664
Because you're
a goddamn fortune teller, Elly.

393
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:50,582
I mean, come on.

394
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,170
It doesn't take a genius to imagine
a covert intel organization

395
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,839
the world doesn't know about.

396
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:59,341
It sure as shit does
to predict they'd go rogue.

397
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,260
Yeah.

398
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:06,431
Somehow, you wrote a story that's
still unfolding as we speak. Book five.

399
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,016
You read book five?

400
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:10,519
Oh, yeah.

401
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:11,979
The bad guys too.

402
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:17,317
The Division has read book five?

403
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,195
The Division doesn't miss
a single keystroke of yours, Elly.

404
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,323
But your new manuscript kicked a hornet's
nest you didn't even know existed.

405
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:24,867
That's why the Division wants you,

406
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,495
and once they have you,
they're never gonna let you go, or worse.

407
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,456
Much, much worse.

408
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,418
Clementine...

409
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:38,463
you're my only comfort.

410
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,511
Did you know that Clementine
was my grandfather's?

411
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:46,054
Yeah.

412
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,724
He named it after his mother.

413
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,017
Oh, boy.

414
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,687
He was a very strict man.

415
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,815
But I always found him reasonable.

416
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:04,823
And he had a policy.

417
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:08,035
He would only kill
if it was absolutely necessary...

418
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,913
for food

419
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,916
or to vanquish an enemy

420
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,754
or to eliminate an incompetent imbecile.

421
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:22,007
Mistakes were made. It won't happen again.

422
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,885
I know it won't.

423
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,931
Of that I'm certain.

424
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,977
This isn't happening.

425
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,979
Yeah, it is. It's definitely happening.

426
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,234
But if you want a way out, if you want
your life back, I can help you.

427
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,693
I'm the good guy here.

428
00:31:41,777 --> 00:31:43,320
But you gotta help me first.

429
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,241
What exactly is it you need me to do?

430
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,868
I'll tell you on the way.

431
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,796
Goddamn, cats!

432
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,796
Goddamn, cats!

433
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,090
Had to bring your cat, man.

434
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:04,758
I thought you said you loved cats.

435
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,426
You have a hankie or a pocket square?

436
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,762
What, do you have allergies or something?

437
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,223
Never mind. It's fine.

438
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,309
You lied.

439
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:16,854
You lied about liking cats.

440
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,564
-Yeah.
-How am I supposed to trust you now?

441
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,983
I'm a spy. Spies lie.

442
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,276
It's part of the gig.

443
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,194
That and killing people.

444
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,488
That's really reassuring.

445
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,534
Okay, you want truth? Here's truth.

446
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,287
What you wrote in your new manuscript
actually happened.

447
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,789
But it wasn't Argylle, it was me.

448
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,041
I brought in this hacker.

449
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:42,379
Hired this scumbag called Bakunin
to steal the Division's master file.

450
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:48,635
Yeah, I've got all the dirt on 'em.
Everyone you asked for.

451
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,637
Ritter, Carlos.

452
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:55,392
I've got proof of bombings,
election fraud, radioactive poisonings.

453
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,229
I mean, these lot make Darth Vader
look like Mary Poppins.

454
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,859
I've put your precious master file
on a flash drive.

455
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,821
I reckon the Division
will give me a lot more

456
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,573
not to give this silver bullet to you.

457
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,577
So, the price just tripled.

458
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,205
We still got a deal?

459
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,582
<i>Yeah, okay, Bakunin, we got a deal.</i>

460
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,042
Yeah, I thought so.

461
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,003
<i>Spasibo.</i>

462
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:26,089
The master file was my silver bullet
to bring the Division down,

463
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,008
the proof I was gonna use to expose them.

464
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:32,429
But when I went to London to meet Bakunin,
scumbag didn't show.

465
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:36,683
So now the bad guys and I
are racing to find him.

466
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:41,313
And we both think that
your fantastic imagination is the key.

467
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,233
So where is he now?

468
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:48,028
No, no, no. You can't expect me
to know the answer to that.

469
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,446
Why not?

470
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,240
Just tell me what happens
in the next chapter.

471
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:55,702
What you're asking me to do
takes months of research.

472
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:56,870
Years.

473
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:01,416
Reading, interviewing,
memorizing maps, getting to know a city.

474
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:01,416
Reading, interviewing,
memorizing maps, getting to know a city.

475
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,627
I've never even been to London before.

476
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,045
Well, great.

477
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,215
Let's start there. Yes.

478
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:13,428
I don't do planes.
I met you on a train for a reason.

479
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:16,514
The chances of you dying in a plane crash
are, like, one in 11 million.

480
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,434
Chances if you stay here and let
the Division find you, not so good.

481
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,436
Right now, that plane is your best friend.

482
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:23,146
What do you say?

483
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:24,898
I can't do this.

484
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,610
Breathe. Breathe with me.

485
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,328
Delicious.

486
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,706
-More champagne, sir?
-Oh, no, I couldn't.

487
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,416
Okay. Twisted my arm.

488
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,710
How about this plane, huh?

489
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,879
I've never been on a plane before, so--

490
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,630
Well, this is one hell of a way
to pop that cherry.

491
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,425
You know what I mean?

492
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,512
<i>This is your captain speaking.
Please fasten your seat belts for takeoff.</i>

493
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,599
Yeah, like this is gonna help us
if we crash.

494
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,728
You okay?

495
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,897
It's a tapping exercise.

496
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,107
It's meant to bring
my stress response under control.

497
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,609
It's what army rangers do.

498
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,652
Oh, God.

499
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,487
You ever try alcohol?

500
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,947
It helps.

501
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,032
No.

502
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,160
Hey, look at me. Hey!

503
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,536
Look at me.

504
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,039
One of my first Division ops,
I'm in Algeria

505
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:26,168
cornered in a Sahrawi refugee camp
literally at the base of Mount "Tachat."

506
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,296
No, Tahat.

507
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,298
It's pronounced Tahat.

508
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,551
It's "Tachat." It's a-- Isn't it a "cha"?

509
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,261
No, no, no. There's no C. It's Tahat.

510
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,721
It's...

511
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:40,015
It's just Mount Tahat, okay?

512
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:41,433
Okay.

513
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,478
Now I start free-scaling this sucker.

514
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:45,854
I'm no mountain climber,

515
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:49,525
so I know any minute I'm gonna just, wham,
free fall a few hundred feet per second.

516
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:52,110
Burst like a water balloon on impact.

517
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:53,737
So what did I do?

518
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:58,367
I stopped worrying about
the ten-thousand-foot rock face above me,

519
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,286
and I worked the three-foot space
in front of me.

520
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,286
and I worked the three-foot space
in front of me.

521
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,501
So, when you feel that fear, remember
to focus on the only thing that's real.

522
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:09,795
What's right in front of you.

523
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:15,968
Look at that.

524
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,689
We're flying.

525
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,399
Yeah.

526
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,026
We're flying.

527
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,530
Thank you.

528
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:38,824
You bet.

529
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,472
Oh, God.

530
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,558
Had to bring the cat.

531
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:07,519
What did you expect me to do?
Leave him to fend for himself? Come on.

532
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:11,607
He'd be fine. Cat ladies always die alone.
The cats figure it out.

533
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,818
I am not a cat lady. I'm not.

534
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,863
And what's your problem
with my cat, exactly?

535
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,573
He's really cute. He's cuddly.

536
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,074
-He's loyal. He's kind.
-Please.

537
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:25,370
You suddenly drop dead, that cat's
chewing your ears off within 48 hours max.

538
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:28,290
Which, with you around,
gets more likely by the minute.

539
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:31,835
This is the spot.

540
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,421
The Albert Memorial.

541
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,256
Wow.

542
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,426
I showed up right on time.
Bakunin never called.

543
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,180
The question is, what happened?

544
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,723
It's a good question.

545
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:45,849
Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:46,892
Yeah, what happened?

547
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,810
It's not a rhetorical question.

548
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,438
What happened?

549
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:54,566
I can't just-- poof--
come up with the answer.

550
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,526
Sure you can.

551
00:37:55,609 --> 00:38:00,322
End of book five, Argylle was on his way
to meet a hacker in London, right?

552
00:37:55,609 --> 00:38:00,322
End of book five, Argylle was on his way
to meet a hacker in London, right?

553
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,116
So you just write one more chapter
and tell me what happens next.

554
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,368
No.

555
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,662
This is not my process.

556
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,374
Well, we're in a public park
being pursued by assassins

557
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,877
hunting you on behalf of the most
dangerous spy organization on Earth,

558
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:18,090
so unless you have a better idea,
perhaps you could compromise.

559
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,263
Okay, let's find a seat.

560
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,647
Sir, we've found them.

561
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,780
They're at the Albert Memorial
in Hyde Park.

562
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:45,409
This is live right now.
One of her fans is live streaming her.

563
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,287
That's definitely her. It's Elly Conway.

564
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,751
-Carlos.
-Yes, sir?

565
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,044
Deploy a local team.

566
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:59,423
I want all UK assets repositioned
and fixed on them now.

567
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,258
Get me the audio. I wanna hear this.

568
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,258
Get me the audio. I wanna hear this.

569
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,260
Digital lip-read activated.

570
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:06,763
<i>How are we doing there, boss?</i>

571
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:10,392
<i>Please. Please, just don't rush me.
I've gotta think.</i>

572
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,770
He's getting her
to write the next chapter.

573
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,816
It's not <i>War and Peace</i>, you know?
We just need a chapter.

574
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,067
Maybe a couple of pages.

575
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:31,580
As Argylle arrived
at the rendezvous point...

576
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,292
he realized...

577
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:58,482
So, what, is this guy just a no-show?

578
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:03,111
Why would he give me the phone
not to call? Unless...

579
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:03,111
Why would he give me the phone
not to call? Unless...

580
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,114
The phone is the message.

581
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,242
There. Look.

582
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:18,794
Why put a $2,200 encryption chip
in a $20 disposable phone?

583
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:19,962
He's trying to tell us how to...

584
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,338
...find him.

585
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:26,552
Could I see the phone?

586
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,095
You mean the flip phone? The burner?

587
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:29,847
Yeah. We need to open it up.

588
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,017
If I'm right, Bakunin could have fitted it
with an encryption CPU.

589
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,394
Sure.

590
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:36,812
-Where is it?
-Threw it out.

591
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:42,442
You don't have it? You threw it out?
That was a clue.

592
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,778
It ran out of juice. It's a burner.

593
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,488
What kind of spy are you?

594
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:49,616
Clearly, I'm not working
with Agent Argylle here.

595
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,829
With this chip, in theory,
could you make end-to-end encrypted calls?

596
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,957
In theory. But the person on the other end
would have to have a matching--

597
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,877
...matching DiSEqC satellite dish.
That's it.

598
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,212
You heard them. DiSEqC database.

599
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,212
You heard them. DiSEqC database.

600
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,007
He picked the chip to lead us
to his satellite.

601
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,050
We find the satellite, we find Bakunin.

602
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:09,469
The question is...

603
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,556
How do we find a list
of operational DiSEqC satellites in...

604
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,765
...in the UK?

605
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,898
Watch the master at work.

606
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,774
You know how to do that?

607
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,485
Keira did teach me a thing or two,
you know?

608
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,696
So, I'm just gonna backdoor my way
into the DiSEqC data--

609
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:32,284
...base. Every satellite they sell
would have to be registered with them.

610
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:38,332
If we don't crack this before they do,
heads will roll.

611
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,377
Look at this. Metasploit firewall.

612
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:45,964
-That's a Metasploit f--
-Yeah, I can crack it. Just hold on.

613
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,091
-Well?
-I can crack it. Hold on.

614
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,635
Challenge accepted.

615
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,094
Almost there.

616
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,347
Almost th--

617
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,431
There.

618
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,392
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

619
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,393
I'm in.

620
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,354
Like to see Argylle do that.

621
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,354
Like to see Argylle do that.

622
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,147
I'd like to see you try doing that.

623
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:03,982
So, what do we have here? How many...

624
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,651
...satellite locations are there?

625
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,778
A lot. That's ninety--

626
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,154
...six to be precise.

627
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,113
Shit.

628
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:13,158
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

629
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:18,872
But he would have picked this location,
the Albert Memorial, for a reason.

630
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:30,467
-What's the...
-...closest one to here?

631
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,678
Well, then you're looking
for this puppy right here.

632
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:34,930
And that-- that's the absolute
closest address...

633
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:36,473
-...to the Memorial?
-Yes, ma'am.

634
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,476
-Yes, sir.
-Coburg Street.

635
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,019
Coburg Street.

636
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:47,693
As in Prince Albert Saxe--

637
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,821
...Coburg. I...

638
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,030
-...think we've found...
-...our guy.

639
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:54,825
Let's hope you're right.

640
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,452
Writer's intuition.

641
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,591
No one's home. What should we do?

642
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:16,346
Well, I am a spy, after all.

643
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:26,273
All right. Writer's intuition, huh?

644
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,160
Notice anything?

645
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:41,205
Yeah, Bakunin was loaded.
He wouldn't live in a dump like this.

646
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,919
-Team one, what's your status?
-We're two miles out.

647
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:53,842
No, it's wallpaper over brick.
Does that seem normal to you?

648
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,429
Whoever lived here had bad taste?
Can we-- Let's split.

649
00:43:58,764 --> 00:43:59,932
What are you doing?

650
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,851
Look. There's a line. This is a clue.

651
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:10,025
-Look at this.
-That's Spackle. That's plaster. Let's go.

652
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:11,193
This is something.

653
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:14,947
We got 95 more locations to check.
Come on, let's get outta here.

654
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,117
No. Just wait. Let me figure it out.

655
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,328
I know this is the place.

656
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:23,789
Okay, you're gonna waste my time,
I'll waste your time.

657
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,750
-You like to dance?
-No.

658
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:28,418
I do. Yeah!

659
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,515
<i>Team leader, report.</i>

660
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,267
Sir, we're one mile out.

661
00:44:47,271 --> 00:44:48,522
Can you see anything?

662
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,362
Wait a second.

663
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:03,620
-It's a lockbox. You can pick it.
-Yeah.

664
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:03,620
-It's a lockbox. You can pick it.
-Yeah.

665
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:04,997
-Yeah.
-Great idea.

666
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:11,253
Will you please give me just,
like, a little bit of warning

667
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:13,505
-before you start shooting?
-What's wrong?

668
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:16,967
What happened to all the spy
lock-picking expertise?

669
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,510
That one looked harder.

670
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:24,308
Hey! All right. Now we're talking.

671
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,392
What's this?

672
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,312
This is a boat key.

673
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,022
How do you know that's a boat key?

674
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,190
I live on a lake.

675
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,404
IP addresses, VPN IDs, drop-sites.
It's all encoded.

676
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,699
This is the anarchist symbol.

677
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,035
It's Bakunin's namesake.

678
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:45,162
It's after the 19th-century
Russian anarchist.

679
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,956
This is it. This is Bakunin's.

680
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,376
Shit. This is his logbook.

681
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,047
Yeah, and it could lead us
to the master file. Look!

682
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,423
You were right.

683
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:58,342
You nailed it.

684
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:03,639
-I figured it out.
-Nice going. You figured it out.

685
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,397
I figured it out.

686
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,983
Can you figure this out?

687
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,411
All right.

688
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,841
We breach on my count.

689
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:45,180
Three, two, one. Go!

690
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:14,835
-Room is secure. The target's MIA.
-Shit!

691
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:21,341
God, I hate that cat.

692
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:31,018
No, no, no.

693
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,610
Why does this keep happening?

694
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:43,030
There's a guy!

695
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:03,926
-Watch this.
-Watch what?

696
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,886
This!

697
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,293
Oh, no.

698
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:01,859
I'm sorry.

699
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,945
That cat just used up
one of his nine lives. Trust me.

700
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:10,993
-Cat's a nightmare.
-Yeah, it's not his finest moment.

701
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:17,791
Actually, feels a lot better.
Feels pretty good.

702
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,751
Satchel, please. Thank you very much.

703
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:24,214
Okay, these Division dudes,
they come in waves.

704
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,299
There's gonna be more.

705
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:32,055
So, unless you wanna stick around
for a meet and greet, I suggest we boogie.

706
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,140
Okay.

707
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,683
Here, hold-- Wait.

708
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:36,685
No. Come here. Come here, come on.

709
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:38,061
Come on. Not that way.

710
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,399
-Hold that. Hold that for me.
-Okay.

711
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,752
-Take it.
-Thank you.

712
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,257
-I'm gonna take 'em out.
-Okay.

713
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:10,969
And you're gonna
stomp their heads as we pass.

714
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:12,596
-Yeah.
-Make sure they're 86'd.

715
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,514
Got it?

716
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,601
I can't stomp on their heads!

717
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:20,687
Course you can.
The human skull is shockingly brittle.

718
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:22,064
What?

719
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:25,776
It's just like crushing an egg.
Or you ever hit a melon with a hammer?

720
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:29,154
It's like-- You just lift up
your leg and crush.

721
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,198
Like that, right?

722
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,660
No, no. It's great. It's fun.
Like the twist. You ever do the twist?

723
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:40,749
It's like doing the twist. One, two, three
and crush that head. One, two, three.

724
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:43,168
I don't dance. I don't crush skulls.

725
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,629
Well, then this should be a fun
new experience for you.

726
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,714
Three, two, one.

727
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:54,638
Let's go.

728
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:09,486
Okay. You can do this. Twist and crush.

729
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,782
Twist and crush.

730
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:17,870
Okay.

731
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:19,454
Twist and...

732
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:22,749
And...

733
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:27,004
I can't do this. I can't do this.

734
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,173
Elly, what's happening?

735
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:38,432
Elly! What happened to all the crushing?

736
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:40,601
What happened?

737
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:46,148
I did my job. You didn't do your job.

738
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,608
Yes, right. No.

739
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:52,404
-So, I wanted to, I did. It just--
-Yeah.

740
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:55,574
It didn't really seem necessary. You know?

741
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,494
You were saying?

742
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:02,664
My bad.

743
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,543
Oh, no. There's more of them?

744
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:13,842
{\an8}Where you going? Where you going?

745
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:29,900
That was convenient.

746
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:33,987
Okay.

747
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:41,620
All right, wait a second.
Aidan, Aidan, that bar.

748
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:47,125
This boat. The boat key. This is Bakunin.
This is Bakunin's escape plan.

749
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:51,713
He must have left a rope
or a ladder or something to get down.

750
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:53,006
No, we're gonna jump.

751
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:55,509
-What?
-We're gonna jump.

752
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:56,969
No, no, no.

753
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,220
We're three stories up.

754
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,597
You were right.
Bakunin thought this whole thing through.

755
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,597
You were right.
Bakunin thought this whole thing through.

756
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,392
-Underneath that tarp is a crash mat.
-No.

757
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,228
-Guaranteed, I'm telling you.
-What if you are wrong?

758
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:09,439
Look, trust me.
Look where I've gotten you so far.

759
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:11,900
Yeah, cornered on a roof,
about to be killed.

760
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:13,402
-Okay, fair point.
-Oh, my God.

761
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:16,572
Let me ask you something.
You trust Alfie, right?

762
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,156
Of course.

763
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,595
Thank God.

764
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:41,597
Holy shit. It worked.

765
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,141
-Thank God. Oh, my God. No.
-We're gonna jump.

766
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,310
-Arms out, landing on our back.
-No.

767
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,811
-It's gonna-- Like a trust fall.
-No.

768
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,313
-You ever do a trust fall?
-No.

769
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,814
-It's gonna be great.
-Oh, God.

770
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:51,940
Alfie's all on his own.

771
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:54,484
-We gotta get down there.
-Oh, God. Oh, my God.

772
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,612
Look at him, he landed like a ninja.

773
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,739
-He's totally fine.
-Okay.

774
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,741
-Ready? On the count of three.
-Oh, my God.

775
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,741
-Ready? On the count of three.
-Oh, my God.

776
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,951
One, two,

777
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:10,292
-three!
-Alfie!

778
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,932
-Alfie, thank God.
-Come on, we're sitting ducks. Let's go.

779
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:28,101
-Come on. Let's go. You wanna get shot?
-You're my sweet little baby.

780
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,702
<i>They got away, sir.</i>

781
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,547
I'm so sorry, Mr. Director.

782
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,468
Regret for time wasted
is wasting more time.

783
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,468
Regret for time wasted
is wasting more time.

784
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:06,390
Fuel up the jet.
We're taking a little trip to Europe.

785
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:19,152
When I catch you, Bakunin.

786
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:22,698
Clever, clever, clever man.

787
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:34,835
Oh, God, no.

788
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:38,338
Leave me alone.

789
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,091
Finally, a little acknowledgment.

790
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:47,431
Look who wants to make friends.
You wanna be friends?

791
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,601
Why do you keep pretending I'm not here?

792
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,645
Because you're not real.

793
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:55,981
Then why are you talking to me?

794
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:58,400
No, that's the problem.
You're just a hallucination.

795
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:00,068
You're there because of my stress
and anxiety

796
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:00,068
You're there because of my stress
and anxiety

797
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:02,779
triggering a visual coping mechanism
or something.

798
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,948
You're just a character I made up.

799
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,242
Am I?

800
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:11,079
Yeah, you're a little pain in the ass.
Get outta here.

801
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,289
Go away.

802
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:14,666
Get outta here.

803
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,711
You are the author.
Your word is my command.

804
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:34,228
God--

805
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,021
Get outta here.

806
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,357
Cat scratched me.

807
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,360
I wonder why.

808
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:46,865
Our boy used a symmetric-key algorithm
to encrypt it.

809
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,408
Feistel construction?

810
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,786
Lai-Massey scheme.
Straight out of book one.

811
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,165
You actually do know your <i>Argylle</i>.

812
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,210
Yeah, that wasn't bullshit on the train.
I'm a loyal reader.

813
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:00,963
You're one hell of a writer, Elly Conway.

814
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:00,963
You're one hell of a writer, Elly Conway.

815
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,047
Okay.

816
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,007
You're not a half-bad spy either.

817
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:06,802
Yeah.

818
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:09,930
Well, thank you.

819
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:14,268
The shower's all yours.

820
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:19,189
You trying to tell me something?

821
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:25,070
Although, I sh-- Probably should do that.
Yeah, okay. I can take a hint.

822
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Leave him alone, buddy.

823
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:52,764
Leave him alone. Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

824
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:03,400
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I got her.
I don't know, some fleabag motel.

825
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:03,400
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I got her.
I don't know, some fleabag motel.

826
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:06,820
She doesn't suspect a goddamn thing.

827
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:10,115
No. Look, she's driving me nuts.

828
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,036
Elly Conway needs a bullet in her head.

829
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:20,876
No, listen. I bring her to you,

830
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:24,922
<i>and then we end it. Okay?
I'm done with this shit.</i>

831
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:30,761
Yeah. No, no. That's it. That's it.

832
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:57,579
Hey.

833
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,665
What are you doing here again, Leonard?

834
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:01,124
How much sugar can one man need?

835
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:01,124
How much sugar can one man need?

836
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:04,503
-I don't get it.
-No, no. I'm not here for sugar.

837
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:08,382
It's your daughter.
Calling collect from London. It's Elly.

838
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:13,554
-Hello.
-Mom. Mom, hi.

839
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:16,557
Elly, oh, baby. We were worried sick
when you didn't show up.

840
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,059
<i>What are you doing in London?</i>

841
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:21,186
Leonard, I'm trying to speak
with my daughter.

842
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,646
Can we have some privacy, please?

843
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:24,273
But it's my phone.

844
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:27,484
Like it was my sugar.
Did I pester you for it back?

845
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,319
Go home, Leonard.

846
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:33,657
Elly, wait. You got on an airplane?

847
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,492
<i>That is great.</i>

848
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:38,120
Yeah. Yeah, well,
not as great as it sounds.

849
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,415
I'm in some really big trouble, Mom.

850
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:43,500
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

851
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,961
<i>It's complicated--</i>

852
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:49,923
-I can't say, not on an open line.
-<i>Open line?</i>

853
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,844
So now you're trying to give me
a full-blown anxiety attack.

854
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,721
That's it. Come home, Elizabeth.

855
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:57,598
No. No, I can't.

856
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:00,559
I don't have any money,
I can't use my credit cards,

857
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:00,559
I don't have any money,
I can't use my credit cards,

858
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:06,398
I have no passport.
I just didn't know who else to call, okay?

859
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:08,483
<i>Well, then we'll come to you, dear.</i>

860
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:12,905
Barry! Book us flights to London! England!

861
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:16,325
Do you remember the hotel
that I put you and Dad up

862
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,492
for your 30th anniversary?

863
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:19,953
Like I'd forget. It's the--

864
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:24,458
<i>Don't say it out loud.
But book the same suite there.</i>

865
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:28,629
<i>If anyone asks,
say it's a business trip for Dad.</i>

866
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,631
<i>One of his dental conferences.</i>

867
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,925
Elly. Oh, my God.

868
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:36,178
Elly, are you okay? Are you hurt?

869
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,180
-Yeah-- No. I'm fine, I swear.
-Are you sure?

870
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:39,973
-Yeah.
-Okay, then give me Alfie.

871
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:43,477
You must be starving, dear.
I ordered all your favorites.

872
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:47,439
-Thank God. I'm so thirsty.
-And you, Alfie.

873
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:51,401
Look, I didn't forget you either.

874
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:56,448
Okay, now, is this all a tax thing?
Because we assumed it was taxes.

875
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:59,660
No, Mom. It's not a tax thing.

876
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:03,038
Listen, were you guys followed?

877
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,082
Followed?

878
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,503
Who on earth would want
to follow us? Dear.

879
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:12,631
I can explain, or try to. Where's Dad?

880
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:13,966
Down the hall, getting ice.

881
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,760
This whole cloak-and-dagger business,
dear, it's scaring me. Okay?

882
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,095
Now, I just wanna know--

883
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:21,014
-Don't open the door.
-It's your father.

884
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:22,933
No. Wait, Mom! Mom!

885
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:32,734
-Elly.
-Dad.

886
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:35,904
This damn hotel.

887
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:38,740
They make you call room service for ice,
can you believe it?

888
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:40,284
Come here, Ells Bells.

889
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,077
Oh, Dad. I'm so sorry

890
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,704
I dragged you and Mom into this.

891
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,706
I didn't have anywhere else to turn.

892
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,457
Don't apologize. It's what--

893
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:50,919
It's what parents are for,
no matter how old you get.

894
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:53,672
Oh, my God, you're trembling, hon.

895
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,465
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

896
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:14,401
It's all going to be just fine.

897
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,033
And what do we always say?

898
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:25,329
-"This too shall"-- Well? Yeah.
-"This too shall pass." No, I know.

899
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:29,458
But I sort of think this one
might not pass as...

900
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:31,710
easily.

901
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:33,837
Okay.

902
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:38,342
So, something I wrote in my new book,
something I made up,

903
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,177
got too close to something very real.

904
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,387
And because of it, a rogue spy agency--

905
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:46,600
A real Directorate suddenly thought I
could help them recover this digital file

906
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:49,269
they'd been searching for,
and so they came after me.

907
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,940
Well... how did you get away, dear?

908
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:55,692
Oh, well, another spy saved me.

909
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:58,070
He promised he could protect me

910
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,781
if I helped him track down
that same file first.

911
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,781
if I helped him track down
that same file first.

912
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:04,868
He convinced me he was the good guy
until I found out he was not.

913
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:08,789
So, I swiped the only lead we had
on this file and--

914
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,708
It's like a hacker's logbook or something.

915
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,502
And came here and--

916
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,254
Well, I just...

917
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:19,299
I just don't know who to trust.

918
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:22,636
So, now you're experimenting
with drugs, dear?

919
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:23,720
-Ruth!
-Mom!

920
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:24,763
-What?
-No!

921
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:27,307
-Look at her eyes. Look at the--
-That's not what's happening.

922
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:31,103
Elly. This logbook, where is it?

923
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,479
Did you bring it?

924
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:35,858
Oh, yeah. It's over there.
It's in my cat pack.

925
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:36,775
Okay.

926
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,205
You have to go to the police. Or the FBI.

927
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:54,877
No, Mom, you don't understand.
These people, they have eyes everywhere.

928
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,255
Well, we can't just do nothing.
No, you have to take it to the press.

929
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:00,424
That's what you do.
Take it to Anderson Cooper.

930
01:03:58,338 --> 01:04:00,424
That's what you do.
Take it to Anderson Cooper.

931
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:02,843
Someone like that, they can--
They-- I don't know---

932
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:06,013
Barry, what do you think? Barry!

933
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,806
-God.
-Pay attention, dear.

934
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,267
What do you think?

935
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:11,852
I'm just--

936
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:15,606
I'm just happy
that you made it here safe and sound,

937
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:18,483
and that psychopath didn't hurt you.

938
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:21,320
God forbid something happened to you,

939
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,614
I don't know
what your mother and I would do.

940
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:26,658
-I think you'd manage just fine.
-What's happening?

941
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:29,244
Oh, God. Mom, quick, get behind me.

942
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:30,412
Don't kill us, please.

943
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:32,748
I'll get you money. I'll get-- No.

944
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,125
I-- You have me mistaken

945
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,543
-for someone else. I'm a dentist.
-Shut up.

946
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:39,046
-Aidan, don't do this.
-It's not what it looks like, Elly.

947
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:42,049
-Let her go.
-This is all my fault. Oh, God. Dad.

948
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:44,218
-You gotta trust me, Elly.
-Trust you?

949
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:48,055
You said you wanted
to put a bullet in my head. I heard you!

950
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,807
You take things way too literally.

951
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:51,892
Oh, God.

952
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,853
But I would love to put
a bullet in his head, I mean it.

953
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:55,938
Enough.

954
01:04:56,939 --> 01:05:00,234
You kill me, the Division will never
stop hunting you. Never.

955
01:04:56,939 --> 01:05:00,234
You kill me, the Division will never
stop hunting you. Never.

956
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:03,278
Dad?

957
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:05,697
What?

958
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:08,951
He's not your dad. Don't you see?

959
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:16,124
-And she's not your--
-Shut up, Wilde.

960
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,377
Don't think I won't enjoy killing her.

961
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:32,266
Mom?

962
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:40,858
-Let's go.
-That's Dad and Mom.

963
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:43,944
Hey. Just look at me.
Hey, you gotta trust me.

964
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,196
You just shot my mother!

965
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,948
That's not your mother.

966
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,325
That woman just
tried to blow your brains out.

967
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:54,872
Who's the only person who hasn't tried
to kill you in the last 72 hours?

968
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:57,833
Intentionally? Let's go.

969
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,835
Come on! Let's go!

970
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:04,965
Get in the car! Let's go!

971
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,550
-What about Alfie?
-Alfie?

972
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,969
-I forgot Alfie.
-The cat?

973
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:11,597
I can't leave him.
I have to go back. I have to.

974
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,809
-You're kidding me.
-He is the only family I have. Please.

975
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:17,728
You wanna go up there
and die with the cat?

976
01:06:17,811 --> 01:06:19,980
Or do you wanna come with me
and hear the truth? It's your call.

977
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:25,194
But there's more bad guys coming, Elly.
Make the call.

978
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,448
What's wrong? You okay?

979
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:13,784
Am I okay?

980
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,704
-Oh, boy.
-You're asking if I'm okay?

981
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,667
My parents just tried to kill me.

982
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:26,004
My mom, who,
by the way, is suddenly British,

983
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:28,715
put a gun to my head.

984
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,467
I have nobody to trust.

985
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:33,720
And Alfie is with these monsters.

986
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,890
They have my Alfie and I'm never
gonna see him again, am I?

987
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:39,476
I'm never gonna see Alfie again.

988
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,897
So, I don't know.
I don't know, Aidan, you tell me.

989
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:49,152
You tell me, do you think I'm--
Do you think I'm okay?

990
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,489
Okay, maybe that was a dumb question.

991
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,578
I can tell you one thing
you're wrong about.

992
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:00,747
You do have someone you can trust.

993
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:00,747
You do have someone you can trust.

994
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:07,713
And trust me, you need some rest, kid.

995
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,758
I'm not tired.

996
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,636
Trust me, you are.

997
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:26,899
The greater the spy, the bigger the lie.
Everything is going to be okay.

998
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:14,571
Morning, sunshine.

999
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:16,907
Where are we?

1000
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:21,578
<i>OlÃ¡</i>, France. I mean, <i>buongiorno, France.</i>

1001
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,665
It's <i>bonjour</i>.

1002
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:25,749
That's what I said.

1003
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:29,419
You like France?

1004
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,464
Tell you what, French people,
they give me the crÃªpes.

1005
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:35,759
Get it? CrÃªpes?

1006
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:41,265
I have more where they came from,
let me tell you.

1007
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,402
Wow.

1008
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:04,538
Well, well. The prodigal spy returns.

1009
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:04,538
Well, well. The prodigal spy returns.

1010
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:10,460
That it?

1011
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:13,589
Good man.

1012
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,426
Elly, this is Alfie.

1013
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:19,469
Alfie?

1014
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:22,431
Her cat-- She named her cat Alfie.

1015
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:24,641
It's a perfect name.

1016
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:28,645
For a very cool cat.

1017
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:34,026
Alfie.

1018
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:37,696
-As in Alfred Solomon?
-Yeah.

1019
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:42,576
The former Deputy Director of CIA,
Alfred Solomon?

1020
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:49,750
No more tears. I promise.

1021
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:51,710
Thank you.

1022
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:54,171
Would you like to go for a walk?

1023
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:56,798
Sure.

1024
01:11:09,353 --> 01:11:10,354
You a wine drinker?

1025
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:11,939
Yeah, sometimes.

1026
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:21,740
Pinot noir.
One of the oldest grapes there is.

1027
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:27,162
Been around since the Roman Empire.
Grown all over the world.

1028
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:31,333
But you know why the wine we make
tastes so distinctly different

1029
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:35,838
from a pinot made in,
say, Napa or Tuscany?

1030
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:37,506
-Mm-mm.
-Same grape.

1031
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,092
The difference is where it's been.

1032
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:44,179
A summer heat wave gets you
a more exotic, tropical flavor.

1033
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:48,475
High elevation gives you a--
an acidic varietal and so on.

1034
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:54,648
They're products of their environment.
The <i>terroir</i>, as the French call it.

1035
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,404
Can't know what a grape is
till you know what it's been through.

1036
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,404
Can't know what a grape is
till you know what it's been through.

1037
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,753
This is how the ancients
fermented their wine.

1038
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:21,216
A technique forgotten by history
until thousands of years later,

1039
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:25,512
when a French farmer stumbled upon
the ruins of vats like these

1040
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:28,015
buried on his property.

1041
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:31,685
<i>Et voilÃ .</i> What was lost was now found.

1042
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,355
That's the thing about the past,
it's persistent.

1043
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:37,983
It can be buried but still down there,

1044
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:41,987
waiting for the right person
to come along and dig it up.

1045
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:49,077
Come in.

1046
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:55,000
What is all this?

1047
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:58,378
Why--

1048
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:01,882
Why are we here?

1049
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:03,926
Because, Elly Conway,

1050
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:09,723
it's time for you
to meet the real Agent Argylle.

1051
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:15,145
Those books you write?
Aidan told you they were predictions.

1052
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:17,648
Well, they're not.

1053
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:23,237
They're memories of who you truly are.

1054
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:34,790
Welcome back, Agent R. Kylle.

1055
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:42,214
This is BS.

1056
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:54,685
BS! Your friend? Looney tunes!

1057
01:13:54,768 --> 01:14:00,858
Do you hear me?
Looney tunes! I am a writer!

1058
01:13:54,768 --> 01:14:00,858
Do you hear me?
Looney tunes! I am a writer!

1059
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:03,402
Nothing more, nothing less.

1060
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:08,240
Regardless of whatever
deepfake nonsense he just showed me.

1061
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:10,367
Oh, for the love of baby Jesus!

1062
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,870
I can't even believe
what's happening to me!

1063
01:14:12,953 --> 01:14:14,246
Stop whining!

1064
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:19,334
Your name is Rachel Kylle
and you don't whine about anything.

1065
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:21,211
You're calling this whining?

1066
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:23,922
You think spy novels are cheesy crap!

1067
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:28,468
You don't even like cats.
You're a dog person.

1068
01:14:28,552 --> 01:14:30,345
I am not!

1069
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:35,225
I am Elly. Elly Conway.

1070
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:36,727
Well, I miss Rachel.

1071
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:40,898
I'm sorry. You clearly miss somebody
who is not me, okay?

1072
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:47,779
Okay, fine. You know what?
I never wanna see Elly Conway ever again.

1073
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:50,699
Car is all yours. Au revoir, Elly.

1074
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:53,076
Great. Au revoir.

1075
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,292
-What?
-Yeah.

1076
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,292
-What?
-Yeah.

1077
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:03,504
Let's go. How fast are you?

1078
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,068
Hi, Rachel.

1079
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,031
I wanna know everything.

1080
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:38,664
So, we meet again, Lai-Massey.

1081
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:40,415
My old foe.

1082
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:47,422
What is taking so goddamn long?

1083
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:52,761
I put myself out there in the field
to capture these images.

1084
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:56,390
There are my results. Where's yours?

1085
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:59,685
Decrypting a Lai-Massey scheme
takes time, Mr. Director.

1086
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:05,274
No, no, no. But there is no time.
Everything hinges on this.

1087
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:05,274
No, no, no. But there is no time.
Everything hinges on this.

1088
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:11,655
Why all the lies?

1089
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:14,324
I mean, why didn't you just
come out and tell me?

1090
01:16:14,408 --> 01:16:17,661
We had to let your memories come back
in their own time, naturally.

1091
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:22,291
Otherwise, you could lose everything
that's buried in there for good.

1092
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,628
What happened to me?

1093
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:29,882
Okay.

1094
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:31,091
Last time I saw you

1095
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:35,429
was the morning you left to rendezvous
with Bakunin at the Albert Memorial.

1096
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:40,017
<i>It wasn't me who went there, it was you.</i>

1097
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:43,437
And you never came back.

1098
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:49,359
We still don't know what went wrong,
how things went south that day.

1099
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:53,822
We just know that you turned up
in a local ER in a coma.

1100
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:57,326
A Jane Doe,
found on the banks of the Thames.

1101
01:16:58,577 --> 01:17:00,412
Which is where the Division found you.

1102
01:16:58,577 --> 01:17:00,412
Which is where the Division found you.

1103
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,081
<i>By the time I tracked you down,</i>

1104
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,709
<i>they'd already moved you
to a hospital in the States.</i>

1105
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:13,467
<i>Rachel, open your eyes.</i>

1106
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:15,928
<i>There you go.</i>

1107
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,556
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

1108
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,727
Do you know who you are?

1109
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,356
You weren't Rachel anymore.

1110
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:30,234
You were a blank slate.

1111
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,194
Couldn't remember a thing.

1112
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:36,365
So the Division
tried a different approach.

1113
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:40,827
One day, a woman I knew
as Dr. Margaret Vogler,

1114
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:43,205
Chief of Psyops for the Division,

1115
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,040
<i>walked in with Ritter.</i>

1116
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:50,379
We're your parents.

1117
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:51,505
Your family.

1118
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,967
-You are Elly.
-Conway.

1119
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:59,596
A small-town waitress
who survived a terrible skating accident.

1120
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,392
We brought in a few things
so that you can remember who you are.

1121
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,392
We brought in a few things
so that you can remember who you are.

1122
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:06,103
They laid it on real thick.

1123
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,401
Look at this, your music box.

1124
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:14,987
<i>Brought you mementos handpicked by Vogler.</i>

1125
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:20,868
Visual triggers to remind you of the life
they wanted you to believe you'd led.

1126
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,537
Ice-skating award. That's right.

1127
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:26,331
And this.

1128
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,375
-<i>Lights, please, dear.</i>
-<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1129
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:37,551
Remember.

1130
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:40,053
<i>Vogler's work was MK-ULTRA on steroids,</i>

1131
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:42,222
Manchurian Candidate<i>-type stuff.</i>

1132
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,185
<i>Elly.</i>

1133
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:48,020
<i>Ice-skating.</i>

1134
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:52,774
<i>They brainwashed you, Elly.
It's as simple as that.</i>

1135
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:56,403
<i>Hey.</i>

1136
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:59,656
<i>Dad. Mom.</i>

1137
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,492
<i>Which left me with only one place to turn.</i>

1138
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,492
<i>Which left me with only one place to turn.</i>

1139
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:05,329
<i>Alfie, the man who trained us.</i>

1140
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:10,334
<i>He opened an investigation,
but without the master file as proof,</i>

1141
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:13,795
<i>Ritter had him dismissed
as a conspiracy theorist</i>

1142
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:16,590
<i>and has been hunting him ever since.</i>

1143
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:19,468
With Alfie on the run
and no one else left to stop them,

1144
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,095
the Division set about
the last part of their plan.

1145
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:25,516
Now that you're starting to remember
who you are,

1146
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:28,977
we thought it might be time
to give you back your journal.

1147
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,145
Yeah.

1148
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:33,857
{\an8}So you can finally write all the stories
that you've wanted to tell.

1149
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:39,279
<i>The journal that they gave you
was a phony, written by Dr. Vogler.</i>

1150
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:42,824
<i>All she did was give you
the building blocks of your life</i>

1151
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,077
<i>with just enough distance from the truth</i>

1152
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,205
<i>to protect the actual names,
places, events.</i>

1153
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,999
Hoping to get a glimpse
of your real memories

1154
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:54,169
through the stories
they encouraged you to tell.

1155
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:56,755
<i>Crazy part is it worked.</i>

1156
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:59,800
<i>You started to write
a novelization of your real life.</i>

1157
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:03,637
<i>We just had to sit back
and watch it play out.</i>

1158
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,723
Book by book, you got closer and closer

1159
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:09,518
until, last week, you were on the verge
of giving the Division

1160
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,813
exactly what they needed to know.
At which point, they were gonna--

1161
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:14,982
They'd kill me.

1162
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:17,401
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

1163
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:18,861
Not on my watch.

1164
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,447
Wait, so, you've been watching me
for the last five years?

1165
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:26,577
Yeah, I guess I have.
But-- No, you know, not in a creepy way.

1166
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:29,788
Just because you forgot who you were...

1167
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:33,500
doesn't mean I ever did.

1168
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:38,005
I know you better than
you know yourself, kid.

1169
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:41,049
Who am I, Aidan?

1170
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,218
Well,

1171
01:20:43,302 --> 01:20:46,263
once upon a time,
there was a CIA operative,

1172
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:50,434
just about the finest field agent
Langley ever trained.

1173
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:54,771
Which is why you were recruited
by the Division.

1174
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,357
And just like in your books,

1175
01:20:57,441 --> 01:20:58,859
there was a real Wyatt.

1176
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,530
You're the real Wyatt?

1177
01:21:04,907 --> 01:21:06,283
You're welcome.

1178
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:07,784
I just-- I pictured Wyatt so much...

1179
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:10,537
<i>Bigger? Stronger? Yeah.</i>

1180
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:14,249
I guess that's how
your unconscious remembered me.

1181
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:16,043
I'm flattered, I think.

1182
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:18,462
There's a real Keira too.

1183
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:20,255
Look familiar?

1184
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:22,090
Unfortunately,

1185
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:26,303
Vogler didn't need to change
the way you described her in your books.

1186
01:21:26,386 --> 01:21:28,722
Because of what happened in Greece.

1187
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:32,434
So Keira... actually--

1188
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:34,937
Well, then let's get the hell out of here.

1189
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,022
Killed in action. Shot through the heart,

1190
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:39,441
just the way you wrote it,
by the real Legrange.

1191
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:44,655
Book six, I was gonna
bring her back, you know?

1192
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:51,370
A reader had emailed in this insane,
brilliant idea for a twist.

1193
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:58,377
More insane than all of this?

1194
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:01,296
Guess not.

1195
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:05,050
Agents! Get yourselves down here!

1196
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,803
Lai-Massey just got its ass whipped

1197
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:09,263
by me!

1198
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:14,601
The data in Bakunin's logbook

1199
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:16,770
tells us he left the master file

1200
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:20,774
with the Keeper of Secrets,
Miss Saba Al-Badr.

1201
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:22,651
According to the Koran,

1202
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:25,696
to keep another's secret
is a divinely mandated duty.

1203
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:28,240
To divulge it, an unholy sin.

1204
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:32,578
Miss Al-Badr has taken that belief
to a whole 'nother level.

1205
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:35,622
Now, Bakunin left specific instructions

1206
01:22:35,706 --> 01:22:41,086
that the master file is to be retrieved
by one person, and one person only:

1207
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:43,005
The agent he was making the deal with

1208
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:46,300
and an old acquaintance of the Keeper's,

1209
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:47,676
Rachel Kylle.

1210
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:49,136
No. No. No, no.

1211
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:51,722
If the Keeper is expecting Rachel Kylle,

1212
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:55,017
she will know something's up
when she meets me.

1213
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:57,644
I get anxiety. I have panic attacks.

1214
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:01,815
Only because you've been
systematically conditioned to by Vogler.

1215
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:01,815
Only because you've been
systematically conditioned to by Vogler.

1216
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:05,903
Well, whatever they did to my head worked,

1217
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,405
because I am not okay.

1218
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:11,533
I can't pull off a spy mission.

1219
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:15,370
I can't even look at him
without seeing Argylle.

1220
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:18,040
Yes, Argylle speaks to me.

1221
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:20,459
And you know what?
I find it kind of reassuring.

1222
01:23:21,335 --> 01:23:23,545
I mean, don't you get it?
I am losing my mind.

1223
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:26,006
You are not losing your mind,

1224
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:27,716
you are finding it.

1225
01:23:27,799 --> 01:23:31,595
Argylle is your subconscious
fighting to tell you who you really are.

1226
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:34,097
Elly.

1227
01:23:34,806 --> 01:23:36,058
Elly.

1228
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:38,852
If you can write Agent Argylle
for five years,

1229
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:41,396
you can be Rachel Kylle for one night.

1230
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:45,651
You got this.

1231
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:48,820
I know you do.

1232
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:55,994
We can do it together.

1233
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:01,208
Good.

1234
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,335
Let's get you two suited and booted.

1235
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,671
And if you can't remember the reality,

1236
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:08,924
I suggest you both dress like the fantasy.

1237
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:43,709
Looking good.

1238
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:45,836
Not feeling very good.

1239
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:47,671
It's gonna be all right.

1240
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:27,211
I think I'm gonna need a drink.

1241
01:25:27,294 --> 01:25:28,837
It's a dry palace, Elly.

1242
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:32,299
Alcohol and keeping secrets
don't pair well together.

1243
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:35,260
Two club sodas, please.

1244
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:38,555
When the Keeper's ready, she'll summon us.
For now, just relax.

1245
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:42,935
Listen, if you're nervous, that's okay.

1246
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:45,437
Why would I be nervous?
Of course I'm not nervous.

1247
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:47,898
There's nothing to be nervous about,
right, Aidan?

1248
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:48,982
Thank you.

1249
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:50,943
Of course I'm nervous.

1250
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:54,071
I'm freaking out.
I'm totally freaking out.

1251
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:57,407
You know what's good for nerves? Dancing.

1252
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,701
-Dancing?
-Yeah.

1253
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:02,996
-There's no one dancing.
-Just blend in.

1254
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,623
You're the only person dancing.

1255
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,291
What about this?

1256
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:09,461
Aidan, I can't dance, so...

1257
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:14,216
Maybe Elly Conway can't dance,
but Rachel Kylle sure could.

1258
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:17,177
-I can't dance.
-Oh, sure you can. You got it.

1259
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,429
God.

1260
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:21,598
I don't know. I don't know about--

1261
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:24,268
Let's get silly. What's this?

1262
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,395
This is ridiculous.

1263
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:29,815
-No, Aidan. No.
-You're not getting away that easily.

1264
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:32,651
This jet plane's all fueled up,
it's taking off.

1265
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:34,444
-Can't dance, huh?
-No.

1266
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:36,488
Then what the hell is this?

1267
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:40,367
-Remember the whirlybird?
-What?

1268
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:42,870
Rachel's go-to. Let me tell you.

1269
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:45,289
-What do you mean?
-Yeah, book four.

1270
01:26:45,372 --> 01:26:47,165
-No, no, no.
-Yeah. It's happening.

1271
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:48,542
No, no, no, no, no.

1272
01:27:11,023 --> 01:27:12,024
It's my song.

1273
01:27:12,608 --> 01:27:13,609
No.

1274
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,320
Our song.

1275
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:19,072
This was our song.

1276
01:27:19,615 --> 01:27:20,824
What do you mean?

1277
01:27:23,202 --> 01:27:24,912
Started in Mogadishu.

1278
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:27,956
Agents in the field, the heat of battle.

1279
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,668
It happens,
and it happened again and again.

1280
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:36,590
We just kept finding ways
to find each other, I guess.

1281
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,802
How long were we...

1282
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:45,390
Till the day you disappeared.

1283
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:52,773
When I tell you
the second I saw you on that train...

1284
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,278
that's been the toughest part.

1285
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:00,072
What has?

1286
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:00,072
What has?

1287
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:04,576
Pretending not to love you, kid.

1288
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:07,829
Hardest mission of my life.

1289
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:14,837
So, we were good together?

1290
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:21,969
Pretty goddamn great, if you ask me.

1291
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,763
Just have to take my word for it.

1292
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:27,307
No.

1293
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:29,810
I won't.

1294
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:33,397
I remember.

1295
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:36,817
Apologies,

1296
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:40,571
but public displays
of affection are not permitted.

1297
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:42,364
-Sorry.
-Of course.

1298
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:45,117
-We were just wrapping that up, boss.
-Yes. Sorry.

1299
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,910
The Keeper will see you now, Miss Kylle.

1300
01:28:48,161 --> 01:28:49,162
Great.

1301
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,540
Just Miss Kylle.

1302
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,186
Enjoying the soiree?

1303
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:15,272
Yes. Lovely. Thank you.

1304
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:18,317
The legendary Rachel Kylle,

1305
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:22,362
pretending to be a timid spy novelist
for five long years.

1306
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:25,157
Bravo, my darling. Bravo.

1307
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,040
But you must have missed it.

1308
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:37,419
Missed what?

1309
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:38,795
All of it.

1310
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:40,631
The killing, the lying.

1311
01:29:41,798 --> 01:29:42,799
Me.

1312
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:49,973
I'm not really here for a trip
down memory lane, so...

1313
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:53,936
Of course not.

1314
01:29:54,019 --> 01:29:55,479
Please sit.

1315
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:03,237
When your job is to keep secrets,

1316
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,280
you learn to spot a lie.

1317
01:30:05,822 --> 01:30:07,032
Which leaves me puzzled

1318
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:11,745
because I watched you as Elly Conway,

1319
01:30:12,663 --> 01:30:14,081
I never saw one.

1320
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:17,835
I was deep cover.

1321
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:19,336
I played the part well.

1322
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:22,005
Too well, it often seemed.

1323
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:28,428
So, tell me, who are you really?

1324
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:32,558
Agent Kylle or Elly Conway?

1325
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:35,435
Because I don't believe you're both,

1326
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:39,690
and only one is walking out
of this room alive.

1327
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:42,234
I--

1328
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:45,737
I don't know what to say.

1329
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:49,658
<i>Of course you do.</i>

1330
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:53,954
You don't need me.

1331
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,331
You just need you.

1332
01:31:00,711 --> 01:31:01,879
Farewell.

1333
01:31:08,427 --> 01:31:11,763
Other than that in my line of work, Saba,

1334
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:14,391
you tend not to give a shit

1335
01:31:14,474 --> 01:31:17,603
what a bottom-feeder like yourself
thinks about anything.

1336
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:21,607
So, I'm afraid I must ask...

1337
01:31:25,194 --> 01:31:28,447
are you going to give me my goddamn box,

1338
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,866
or are you going to make me take it?

1339
01:31:35,787 --> 01:31:38,957
Perhaps you haven't changed so much
after all, Agent Kylle.

1340
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:55,891
You're welcome to use my computer.

1341
01:31:57,226 --> 01:31:59,061
And how do I know that's secure?

1342
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:02,773
There is a reason
I'm the Keeper of Secrets.

1343
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:05,692
It's because I keep them.

1344
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:21,124
Oh, Aidan, you're gonna be
a very happy camper.

1345
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,002
Jackpot, Alfie boy.

1346
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:33,053
Shit.

1347
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:38,308
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1348
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:43,063
Hey. There she is.

1349
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,859
What do we got? How'd it go? How'd it go?

1350
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:49,069
That's my--

1351
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:52,614
All right, I'm so proud of you.

1352
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:54,658
Aidan, there's something
I need to know, okay?

1353
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:56,535
-Yeah?
-I need to know wh--

1354
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:58,161
Who you can trust?

1355
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:03,333
Well, now I know who I can't.

1356
01:33:04,376 --> 01:33:06,003
Now, don't blame our host.

1357
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:08,046
Blame yourself
for showing Ritter the ledger.

1358
01:33:09,047 --> 01:33:12,050
And you, please don't try anything stupid.

1359
01:33:12,134 --> 01:33:15,596
Unlike the Savoy, I don't need
to wear a bulletproof vest in here.

1360
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:23,645
Before either of us could start anything,
the Keeper's men would finish it.

1361
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:26,148
So, what do we do now?

1362
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,902
How about a nice cup of tea?

1363
01:33:34,072 --> 01:33:35,407
I'll be mother.

1364
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,585
All right. I'll be father.

1365
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:53,050
You first.

1366
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:11,109
So, you read what was on that drive,
didn't you?

1367
01:34:15,697 --> 01:34:19,034
You're starting
to learn the truth, Rachel.

1368
01:34:21,954 --> 01:34:23,705
It's coming back to you, isn't it?

1369
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:29,169
Starting to remember.

1370
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:34,633
Yes. Remember why you went to Bakunin.

1371
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:37,678
Remember who sent you.

1372
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:43,600
You found me in record time.
Maybe you are as good as they say.

1373
01:34:47,062 --> 01:34:48,522
Keep going.

1374
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:51,316
Follow the memory.

1375
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:55,529
Wire transfer complete.

1376
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:57,239
<i>Spasibo.</i>

1377
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,741
Then give me what I came here for.

1378
01:35:00,409 --> 01:35:01,827
Yeah, it's not here.

1379
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:06,623
Don't look so surprised.
Relax, sweetheart. File's still yours.

1380
01:35:06,707 --> 01:35:11,128
It's waiting for you, and only you,
with the Keeper of Secrets herself.

1381
01:35:11,712 --> 01:35:12,713
Al-Badr?

1382
01:35:14,715 --> 01:35:18,093
Rachel, follow the memory.

1383
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,970
Keep going.

1384
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:23,098
Our business here is done.

1385
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:02,179
I killed Bakunin.

1386
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:04,515
-What?
-Of course you did.

1387
01:36:04,598 --> 01:36:06,975
You never let us down, Rachel.

1388
01:36:07,809 --> 01:36:12,231
<i>You were the most loyal
of all the Division's acolytes.</i>

1389
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:15,692
Tell me that's not true.

1390
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:20,197
You tell me that's not true.
Tell me that's not true!

1391
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:21,990
Listen to me--

1392
01:36:26,954 --> 01:36:29,081
Weapons are not allowed.

1393
01:36:30,457 --> 01:36:33,752
But sleeping aids? Perfectly acceptable.

1394
01:36:57,359 --> 01:36:58,443
There she is.

1395
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:08,245
Where am I?

1396
01:37:09,162 --> 01:37:10,539
You're home, my dear.

1397
01:37:11,832 --> 01:37:12,833
"Dear"?

1398
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:16,920
Are we still dad and daughter?

1399
01:37:17,588 --> 01:37:22,509
Well, whether you remember yet or not...

1400
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:23,594
May I?

1401
01:37:27,431 --> 01:37:29,308
I do care about you, Rachel.

1402
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:35,439
And watching you these past five years
live this pathetic existence--

1403
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:42,988
a lion convinced she's a lamb--
just... just killed me.

1404
01:37:43,989 --> 01:37:45,449
Are you my daughter? No.

1405
01:37:45,532 --> 01:37:49,578
But I am the man who helped you
grow into the woman

1406
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:52,331
you were destined to become.

1407
01:37:55,584 --> 01:37:58,170
But we still have a problem.

1408
01:37:58,253 --> 01:37:59,630
Problem?

1409
01:38:00,672 --> 01:38:02,508
You have the master file.

1410
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:06,887
Yes, but what we don't have is Alfie.

1411
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:10,057
He will never stop trying to expose us.

1412
01:38:10,557 --> 01:38:14,061
So, please, just let us know where he is.

1413
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,103
Ritter, I don't know.

1414
01:38:16,563 --> 01:38:18,232
I'm not lying. I don't know.

1415
01:38:18,315 --> 01:38:20,442
I don't. It was a vineyard

1416
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:22,819
somewhere in the middle
of the French countryside.

1417
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:23,987
Aidan knows.

1418
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:26,281
He took me there. I was sleeping.

1419
01:38:26,365 --> 01:38:31,787
Well, despite our efforts of persuasion,
he won't talk.

1420
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,081
I see.

1421
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,793
I can get it out of him.

1422
01:38:40,462 --> 01:38:43,131
Let the lamb roar.

1423
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:48,637
I'll make you a deal.

1424
01:38:51,807 --> 01:38:52,808
Follow me.

1425
01:38:55,018 --> 01:38:58,272
You give me my Alfie,

1426
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:02,734
and then I will give you yours.

1427
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:02,734
and then I will give you yours.

1428
01:39:06,989 --> 01:39:08,490
Do whatever you want with him.

1429
01:39:11,326 --> 01:39:12,911
I hate cats.

1430
01:39:13,871 --> 01:39:14,872
Me too.

1431
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:20,627
Shall we?

1432
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:23,714
Yes.

1433
01:39:45,235 --> 01:39:46,236
Do you like it?

1434
01:39:46,862 --> 01:39:50,407
We had this reconstructed for when
the director and I were needed on base

1435
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:53,035
but you wanted to FaceTime
dear old Mum and Dad.

1436
01:39:55,162 --> 01:39:57,831
Agent Wilde here still refuses to speak.

1437
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:01,919
Not surprising.
But we're going to try something else.

1438
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:01,919
Not surprising.
But we're going to try something else.

1439
01:40:03,879 --> 01:40:06,757
Aidan, please, tell them.

1440
01:40:08,091 --> 01:40:10,761
Or this'll get ugly fast.

1441
01:40:13,805 --> 01:40:15,557
Where is Alfie?

1442
01:40:16,099 --> 01:40:19,978
Are we talking about the cat again?
'Cause, man...

1443
01:40:20,062 --> 01:40:22,189
Kill me. Kill me now, fellas.

1444
01:40:22,731 --> 01:40:25,776
If you tell me now,
I promise he won't suffer.

1445
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:29,238
But the longer you take
to answer the question--

1446
01:40:29,321 --> 01:40:32,366
and you will answer--

1447
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:35,744
that'll be the length of time
I take to kill him.

1448
01:40:37,037 --> 01:40:38,038
Do you understand?

1449
01:40:39,081 --> 01:40:41,583
How about this?
How about I answer your question

1450
01:40:41,667 --> 01:40:44,378
when you answer one of mine first? Cool?

1451
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,216
You don't wanna fuck with me
right now, Aidan.

1452
01:40:50,592 --> 01:40:53,178
There's one thing
I can't quite square away.

1453
01:40:53,262 --> 01:40:55,931
Once you knew I knew the truth
about the Division,

1454
01:40:56,014 --> 01:40:57,683
you could've killed me.

1455
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:01,186
Could've ended it right there,
but you didn't. Why?

1456
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:01,186
Could've ended it right there,
but you didn't. Why?

1457
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:04,273
<i>It seems we serve the same master.</i>

1458
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:10,445
Cut your feed.

1459
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:17,619
I think it's because...

1460
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:21,415
you wanted out too.

1461
01:41:21,498 --> 01:41:23,125
Just ignore him.

1462
01:41:24,168 --> 01:41:27,588
You were Division through and through.
You always were.

1463
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:30,924
It is why you killed Bakunin.

1464
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:34,011
You killed Bakunin because
you were playing both sides of the fence

1465
01:41:34,094 --> 01:41:36,263
till the very last second.

1466
01:41:36,346 --> 01:41:38,724
You were gonna get that file
and do the right thing.

1467
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:42,019
I know you were.

1468
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:44,354
'Cause...

1469
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:46,023
Elly Conway,

1470
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:47,524
that person,

1471
01:41:48,817 --> 01:41:50,777
that's not all pretend, you know.

1472
01:41:53,488 --> 01:41:55,365
They can't erase that person.

1473
01:42:01,622 --> 01:42:03,332
All that goodness, that's in you.

1474
01:42:03,415 --> 01:42:07,002
That's who Elly Conway is,
and that's who you are.

1475
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:18,472
My name is Rachel Kylle.

1476
01:42:27,856 --> 01:42:30,776
We're gonna wanna check his necklace
for a tracking device.

1477
01:42:36,365 --> 01:42:37,866
What about Alfie?

1478
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,118
How the hell are we gonna find him now?

1479
01:42:40,202 --> 01:42:42,496
He was never going to tell us.

1480
01:42:43,455 --> 01:42:45,457
That was a complete waste of time.

1481
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:49,002
Besides, my mind is clear now.

1482
01:42:50,504 --> 01:42:51,839
I know how to find him.

1483
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:05,894
I checked my watch when we got there,

1484
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:09,398
so it was at least a 12-hour drive.

1485
01:43:10,023 --> 01:43:12,276
Couldn't have been in Burgundy.

1486
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:13,902
Let's see here.

1487
01:43:13,986 --> 01:43:17,364
Okay, I'm gonna pull up OpSpecs
for every mission I was ever on

1488
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:19,616
in the South of France.

1489
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:22,077
See if it jars anything.

1490
01:43:22,703 --> 01:43:24,830
-Not so hard now, mate, are ya?
-Come on, mate.

1491
01:43:24,913 --> 01:43:27,374
-Leave it. He was kind of a legend.
-A legend?

1492
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:30,127
-Well, yeah, he was.
-Yeah. "Was" is the key word. Was.

1493
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:43,015
No, no, no. It was him--

1494
01:43:45,142 --> 01:43:46,768
Is that legendary enough for you?

1495
01:43:50,647 --> 01:43:53,483
His car. His car was parked outside.

1496
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:57,905
French license plates
are numbered by region.

1497
01:43:57,988 --> 01:43:59,615
His was 70.

1498
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:04,620
Seventy... something. I'm sure of it.

1499
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:10,792
Meaning what?

1500
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:14,755
Meaning it is south of Avallon
and north of Cluny.

1501
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:17,633
It means we're close.

1502
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:20,928
It means we're almost there.

1503
01:44:22,179 --> 01:44:25,349
<i>Director Ritter, it's clean.
No tracking device, sir.</i>

1504
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:26,808
Excellent.

1505
01:44:32,022 --> 01:44:33,815
Almost there.

1506
01:44:38,028 --> 01:44:40,864
You can always count on Agent Kylle.

1507
01:44:58,924 --> 01:45:00,551
Almost.

1508
01:44:58,924 --> 01:45:00,551
Almost.

1509
01:45:07,266 --> 01:45:08,267
Found him.

1510
01:45:13,355 --> 01:45:14,356
Brilliant.

1511
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:18,569
Brava, Agent.

1512
01:45:19,444 --> 01:45:20,737
Better yet,

1513
01:45:20,821 --> 01:45:24,116
because you gave me access
to your mainframe,

1514
01:45:24,783 --> 01:45:27,202
I just sent the master file to Alfie.

1515
01:45:28,704 --> 01:45:29,705
What?

1516
01:45:29,788 --> 01:45:33,542
Because I remember everything.

1517
01:45:43,468 --> 01:45:44,928
Almost everything.

1518
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:07,075
Alfie, baby, are you okay?

1519
01:46:07,159 --> 01:46:09,119
I didn't mean a word of what I said.

1520
01:46:09,203 --> 01:46:11,205
Okay, we're gonna go
on a little adventure right now.

1521
01:46:22,633 --> 01:46:24,718
{\an8}Red alert! Red alert!

1522
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:36,271
Okay.

1523
01:46:55,165 --> 01:46:57,584
You gotta be kidding me.

1524
01:46:57,668 --> 01:47:00,045
How are you still alive?

1525
01:46:57,668 --> 01:47:00,045
How are you still alive?

1526
01:47:00,128 --> 01:47:03,215
Remember the last time I saw you?
You scratched me.

1527
01:47:03,298 --> 01:47:05,384
Now look who has a claw.

1528
01:47:06,009 --> 01:47:07,010
Mano a mano.

1529
01:47:07,886 --> 01:47:09,263
Aidan, it's me.

1530
01:47:11,014 --> 01:47:12,641
Okay, I'm putting down my gun.

1531
01:47:14,476 --> 01:47:15,644
On the ground.

1532
01:47:18,063 --> 01:47:20,148
I'm gonna get up very slowly, okay?

1533
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:25,529
Same side, Aidan.

1534
01:47:28,365 --> 01:47:29,658
Same side.

1535
01:47:29,741 --> 01:47:30,951
Same side, huh?

1536
01:47:31,994 --> 01:47:33,787
You shot me in the heart!

1537
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:36,248
Two words, vascular corridor.

1538
01:47:37,708 --> 01:47:40,169
It's how I was gonna bring Keira back.

1539
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:42,379
Book six, remember?

1540
01:47:43,672 --> 01:47:44,840
Keira.

1541
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:47,968
<i>There's a two-inch space
you hit at just the right angle.</i>

1542
01:47:48,051 --> 01:47:49,428
<i>It looks like a shot to the heart,</i>

1543
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:51,722
<i>but the bullet
will go through and through...</i>

1544
01:47:52,264 --> 01:47:53,140
I can save her.

1545
01:47:55,642 --> 01:47:57,519
<i>...as long as you stop the bleeding.</i>

1546
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:11,575
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

1547
01:48:11,658 --> 01:48:13,744
Then why are you still alive?

1548
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:18,332
You purposely shot me through
a two-inch passageway in my chest

1549
01:48:18,415 --> 01:48:22,002
after not firing a gun for five years,
based on an idea a fan sent in.

1550
01:48:22,085 --> 01:48:23,253
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

1551
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:25,797
I mean, I did do the research on it,
but yes.

1552
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:27,299
Yeah, essentially, that's it.

1553
01:48:28,425 --> 01:48:30,469
Who's the fan? Jeffrey Dahmer?

1554
01:48:33,472 --> 01:48:35,807
Yeah, that's impressive.
I'd like to meet that fan.

1555
01:48:36,808 --> 01:48:39,061
Yeah. Well, you and me both.

1556
01:48:39,144 --> 01:48:41,772
Sir, I've found her. She's in the armory.

1557
01:48:41,855 --> 01:48:42,814
Put it up.

1558
01:48:43,482 --> 01:48:45,484
-With Agent Wilde.
-What?

1559
01:48:46,068 --> 01:48:48,320
How is this asshole alive?

1560
01:48:48,403 --> 01:48:51,782
But right now, we have to get to
the server room on the ground floor

1561
01:48:51,865 --> 01:48:54,117
to send Alfie the master file.

1562
01:48:54,701 --> 01:48:57,246
Which means we'll have to
make it through every soldier

1563
01:48:57,329 --> 01:48:58,872
the Division has on this base,

1564
01:48:58,956 --> 01:49:03,794
who Ritter has now had enough time
to make sure are waiting for us

1565
01:48:58,956 --> 01:49:03,794
who Ritter has now had enough time
to make sure are waiting for us

1566
01:49:03,877 --> 01:49:06,547
on the other side of that door.

1567
01:49:07,798 --> 01:49:11,093
So, what do you say, Aidan?

1568
01:49:12,094 --> 01:49:13,512
Wanna dance?

1569
01:49:14,096 --> 01:49:17,432
Oh, man. I thought you'd never ask.

1570
01:50:29,546 --> 01:50:31,256
I can't see shit.

1571
01:50:33,175 --> 01:50:36,595
Nolan, I can't see anything!
Give me thermal imaging now.

1572
01:50:36,678 --> 01:50:38,722
Thermal imaging coming up now.

1573
01:52:18,155 --> 01:52:20,490
Open the extraction vents. All of them.

1574
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:28,248
Come on.

1575
01:52:36,423 --> 01:52:37,424
Carlos!

1576
01:52:37,508 --> 01:52:40,052
Take every unit you have and go now.

1577
01:52:40,135 --> 01:52:41,553
I mean every single unit.

1578
01:52:41,637 --> 01:52:42,846
Yes, sir.

1579
01:53:12,584 --> 01:53:15,295
Hold fire! Hold your fire!

1580
01:53:15,379 --> 01:53:17,548
One spark and we could all die!

1581
01:53:21,385 --> 01:53:24,054
Shut down the pumps. Shut it all down!

1582
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:34,064
Holy shit.

1583
01:53:35,107 --> 01:53:37,109
He's right. It's crude. It's oil.

1584
01:53:37,192 --> 01:53:38,235
What is this place?

1585
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:40,571
Guns down, boys.

1586
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:43,282
Knives up.

1587
01:54:17,274 --> 01:54:19,943
Hey, will you check on Alfie? Is he okay?

1588
01:54:23,906 --> 01:54:26,575
Yeah. Yeah, Alfie's fine.

1589
01:54:28,493 --> 01:54:29,494
We're not.

1590
01:54:40,422 --> 01:54:41,423
Yeah.

1591
01:54:48,597 --> 01:54:50,557
Well, if we're gonna go out with a bang,

1592
01:54:51,975 --> 01:54:54,144
let's go out with a bang,
you know what I mean?

1593
01:55:00,275 --> 01:55:01,735
Ice-skating.

1594
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:05,280
Are those memories real?

1595
01:55:06,782 --> 01:55:09,826
Yeah. I mean, apart from the accident,
yeah. You can skate.

1596
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:11,745
You're a really good skater.

1597
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:16,124
The kissing memories are pretty real too.

1598
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:17,793
-Hold this.
-Do you--

1599
01:55:24,633 --> 01:55:26,051
What do you got in mind, hot sauce?

1600
01:55:31,974 --> 01:55:33,725
Mama's gotta get to work.

1601
01:56:44,171 --> 01:56:45,339
Rachel!

1602
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:48,675
For the record, I hated your books.

1603
01:56:49,551 --> 01:56:50,844
Come on.

1604
01:56:52,179 --> 01:56:53,889
Let's write your final chapter.

1605
01:56:54,515 --> 01:56:55,724
Let's write yours.

1606
01:56:58,769 --> 01:56:59,770
Come on!

1607
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:02,189
Let's finish this!

1608
01:57:27,256 --> 01:57:29,174
Ignore all safety protocols.

1609
01:57:29,258 --> 01:57:31,009
Open fire now!

1610
01:57:31,093 --> 01:57:32,261
Shoot her!

1611
01:57:57,202 --> 01:57:58,745
Now that deserves a kiss.

1612
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:02,165
How about a hot date in the server room?

1613
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:08,630
If you need something done right...

1614
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:20,100
Once we authorize the file to send,
Alfie will get them in minutes.

1615
01:58:24,021 --> 01:58:25,480
You really know what you're doing.

1616
01:58:25,981 --> 01:58:28,901
Now this should bypass
all the security system codes,

1617
01:58:28,984 --> 01:58:31,737
-and then it's game over for these--
-Good job.

1618
01:58:33,822 --> 01:58:34,823
Oh, no.

1619
01:58:34,907 --> 01:58:36,617
What? What's that? What's going on?

1620
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:42,247
She discovered that she'll need
an authorized retina scan

1621
01:58:42,331 --> 01:58:43,749
to get into the system,

1622
01:58:45,042 --> 01:58:49,254
and these are the only peepers
that will do.

1623
01:58:49,838 --> 01:58:52,424
Some safeguards we put into place
after Bakunin.

1624
01:58:53,258 --> 01:58:54,843
You were quite a team.

1625
01:58:55,469 --> 01:58:57,721
You can now say that you died as a team,

1626
01:58:58,347 --> 01:59:02,768
and that will happen right here,
right now.

1627
01:58:58,347 --> 01:59:02,768
and that will happen right here,
right now.

1628
01:59:08,482 --> 01:59:09,733
Jesus.

1629
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,364
Just get him off me! Get it off!

1630
01:59:15,447 --> 01:59:16,698
Oh, shit. The eyes.

1631
01:59:22,621 --> 01:59:26,625
Alfie, you are such a good boy.

1632
01:59:27,251 --> 01:59:31,421
Oh, baby. Yes, I am so proud of you.

1633
01:59:31,505 --> 01:59:34,341
Your little cat assassin
scratched the shit out of Ritter's eyes,

1634
01:59:34,424 --> 01:59:35,843
but I think we needed those.

1635
01:59:37,094 --> 01:59:40,013
-What's the plan?
-I know what to do. Come on. Follow me.

1636
01:59:43,183 --> 01:59:44,184
Roof.

1637
01:59:56,238 --> 01:59:57,739
Holy moly.

1638
02:00:09,334 --> 02:00:13,463
This is it. We can bypass the security
using the satellite dome.

1639
02:00:15,549 --> 02:00:16,550
You taught me that.

1640
02:00:17,134 --> 02:00:18,468
You're welcome.

1641
02:00:21,263 --> 02:00:22,389
Now we're talking.

1642
02:00:22,472 --> 02:00:24,892
Here we go, Lakers. Here we go.

1643
02:00:26,393 --> 02:00:28,478
Overriding mainframe.

1644
02:00:28,562 --> 02:00:30,731
Accessing outbox.

1645
02:00:31,273 --> 02:00:33,150
And just like that...

1646
02:00:35,444 --> 02:00:36,778
Good morning, Alfie.

1647
02:00:43,911 --> 02:00:44,870
Here we go.

1648
02:00:54,922 --> 02:00:57,716
What is that?
Where the hell's it coming from?

1649
02:00:57,799 --> 02:01:00,135
Agent R. Kylle.

1650
02:00:57,799 --> 02:01:00,135
Agent R. Kylle.

1651
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:03,514
Gamma. Delta. Bravo.

1652
02:01:03,597 --> 02:01:06,808
<i>Epsilon. Psi. Omega.</i>

1653
02:01:08,894 --> 02:01:10,479
Target: Wilde.

1654
02:01:10,562 --> 02:01:11,647
What?

1655
02:01:15,651 --> 02:01:17,819
Hey. Wha-- Whoa, whoa.

1656
02:01:20,322 --> 02:01:21,657
What are you doing?

1657
02:01:25,786 --> 02:01:26,745
Activate.

1658
02:01:29,248 --> 02:01:31,416
Goddamn it! Come on!

1659
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:35,504
Stop!

1660
02:01:42,678 --> 02:01:43,971
Yes!

1661
02:01:44,972 --> 02:01:47,558
You don't wanna do this.
She programmed you.

1662
02:01:47,641 --> 02:01:49,059
I'm not gonna fight you.

1663
02:01:49,142 --> 02:01:50,561
You're wasting your time.

1664
02:01:50,644 --> 02:01:51,854
Remember who you are!

1665
02:01:51,937 --> 02:01:53,063
Wilde!

1666
02:01:57,901 --> 02:02:00,445
Jesus! Come on. Come on!

1667
02:01:57,901 --> 02:02:00,445
Jesus! Come on. Come on!

1668
02:02:37,441 --> 02:02:38,609
Baby--

1669
02:02:39,568 --> 02:02:40,777
It's okay.

1670
02:02:41,361 --> 02:02:42,863
I just gotta kill her.

1671
02:03:03,926 --> 02:03:05,344
I'm gonna get you.

1672
02:03:11,683 --> 02:03:12,976
Don't make me do this.

1673
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:17,481
I don't wanna hurt you! Enough!

1674
02:03:17,564 --> 02:03:20,234
I'm afraid you'll have to kill her first.

1675
02:03:21,902 --> 02:03:23,278
I'm not gonna fight you.

1676
02:03:25,614 --> 02:03:27,616
I can't kill you.

1677
02:03:35,207 --> 02:03:36,375
Finish him.

1678
02:03:47,928 --> 02:03:49,555
I know you can't hear me, but--

1679
02:03:52,015 --> 02:03:53,517
I love you.

1680
02:03:58,188 --> 02:03:59,189
Always have.

1681
02:04:02,317 --> 02:04:03,861
Always will.

1682
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:23,255
Okay, babe, you got this.

1683
02:04:31,889 --> 02:04:33,056
Twist...

1684
02:04:39,563 --> 02:04:41,440
and...

1685
02:04:47,863 --> 02:04:51,533
crush.

1686
02:05:14,264 --> 02:05:17,017
You missed. I think.

1687
02:05:18,393 --> 02:05:19,811
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1688
02:05:20,687 --> 02:05:23,065
What have I done? What have I done?

1689
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:25,526
-What have I done? I'm so sorry.
-Hey.

1690
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:26,777
Are you back?

1691
02:05:27,694 --> 02:05:29,029
Yeah.

1692
02:05:29,112 --> 02:05:30,364
Yeah. I'm back.

1693
02:05:31,031 --> 02:05:32,366
Are you okay?

1694
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,284
Are you kidding?

1695
02:05:34,368 --> 02:05:36,203
Here. Come on. Come on. Get up.

1696
02:05:38,038 --> 02:05:40,999
All right. Three, two, one.

1697
02:05:41,083 --> 02:05:42,292
Up.

1698
02:05:42,876 --> 02:05:44,753
Okay, okay, okay.

1699
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:46,004
Give me your arm.

1700
02:05:51,969 --> 02:05:53,470
You got me good. Is that--

1701
02:05:53,554 --> 02:05:56,014
I'm seeing two Keiras.
Are you seeing two Keiras?

1702
02:05:56,098 --> 02:05:57,182
I see one.

1703
02:05:57,266 --> 02:05:58,600
Keira?

1704
02:05:58,684 --> 02:06:01,061
Keira! How are you alive?

1705
02:05:58,684 --> 02:06:01,061
Keira! How are you alive?

1706
02:06:01,645 --> 02:06:05,023
Who do you think was the fan
that sent you the vascular corridor idea?

1707
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:09,361
Personal experience with that one.

1708
02:06:11,655 --> 02:06:12,739
That's the fan?

1709
02:06:14,157 --> 02:06:15,158
Yeah. Come on.

1710
02:06:15,242 --> 02:06:16,535
Though when I didn't hear back,

1711
02:06:16,618 --> 02:06:18,954
I realized you really had
forgotten everything.

1712
02:06:19,037 --> 02:06:22,124
So I burrowed my way
into the Division's networks,

1713
02:06:22,207 --> 02:06:23,542
waiting for the moment to strike.

1714
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:25,711
And then when I saw that
they brought you in,

1715
02:06:25,794 --> 02:06:28,964
I thought, "The moment has arrived."

1716
02:06:29,047 --> 02:06:30,632
Damn straight.

1717
02:06:32,217 --> 02:06:34,178
Aren't you forgetting something?

1718
02:06:51,153 --> 02:06:52,154
Yes!

1719
02:07:00,621 --> 02:07:02,206
I need you to know,

1720
02:07:02,289 --> 02:07:05,083
I was always gonna bring you
the master file.

1721
02:07:33,445 --> 02:07:36,698
<i>Argylle had timed the charges perfectly.</i>

1722
02:07:37,407 --> 02:07:38,909
<i>As the ship sank,</i>

1723
02:07:39,493 --> 02:07:41,495
<i>and the Directorate along with it,</i>

1724
02:07:42,037 --> 02:07:45,666
<i>he realized that,
for the first time in a long time,</i>

1725
02:07:46,416 --> 02:07:49,044
<i>there was no next mission to go on,</i>

1726
02:07:49,127 --> 02:07:52,965
<i>target to acquire,
or threat to neutralize.</i>

1727
02:07:54,967 --> 02:07:56,718
<i>For the first time,</i>

1728
02:07:57,719 --> 02:08:00,848
<i>Argylle was finally free.</i>

1729
02:07:57,719 --> 02:08:00,848
<i>Argylle was finally free.</i>

1730
02:08:13,902 --> 02:08:18,407
And now our final questions
for the one and only Elly Conway.

1731
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:19,491
All right...

1732
02:08:19,575 --> 02:08:20,659
Yeah. Right down here.

1733
02:08:20,742 --> 02:08:24,621
Hi. If we're never gonna get
another Argylle adventure,

1734
02:08:24,705 --> 02:08:26,373
you've gotta at least tell us,

1735
02:08:26,456 --> 02:08:29,960
what do all of these characters do
once the story is over?

1736
02:08:31,503 --> 02:08:32,963
Well,

1737
02:08:33,046 --> 02:08:34,631
I'd like to think

1738
02:08:35,507 --> 02:08:38,552
Alfie got the Distinguished
Intelligence Medal from CIA

1739
02:08:38,635 --> 02:08:42,848
after using the master file to expose
the Directorate's remaining agents.

1740
02:08:45,267 --> 02:08:46,518
Keira--

1741
02:08:46,602 --> 02:08:49,479
Well, Keira always said
that she could be Steve Jobs,

1742
02:08:50,105 --> 02:08:52,357
so I think that's what she did.

1743
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:56,195
She went out, monetized the tech
she developed for the Directorate,

1744
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:59,031
and proved she was right.

1745
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,535
And as for Argylle and Wyatt...

1746
02:09:05,913 --> 02:09:07,206
they're partners.

1747
02:09:07,289 --> 02:09:09,416
So whatever it is they do next,

1748
02:09:10,459 --> 02:09:13,170
I'm sure they'd do it
the way they did everything else...

1749
02:09:15,839 --> 02:09:17,257
False alarm. False alarm.

1750
02:09:18,133 --> 02:09:19,092
Together.

1751
02:09:19,676 --> 02:09:21,929
So proud of you. Love you.

1752
02:09:23,597 --> 02:09:25,057
Okay. Next question.

1753
02:09:25,557 --> 02:09:27,768
Yeah, the gentleman,
yellow shirt in the back.

1754
02:09:31,396 --> 02:09:34,191
Yeah. I don't have
a question as such, but...

1755
02:09:36,985 --> 02:09:39,029
maybe you have one or two for me.

1756
02:10:39,798 --> 02:10:41,967
Cosmopolitan with a twist, please.

1757
02:10:42,467 --> 02:10:45,345
Does it look like
we're in a club or a pub?

1758
02:10:50,267 --> 02:10:51,643
Hold the vodka.

1759
02:10:52,352 --> 02:10:53,604
Yeah?

1760
02:10:55,272 --> 02:10:56,273
The Cointreau.

1761
02:10:57,441 --> 02:10:58,775
The cranberry juice.

1762
02:11:00,611 --> 02:11:01,987
Just the twist.

1763
02:11:05,407 --> 02:11:06,617
Coming right up.

1764
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:18,420
You must be in a lot of trouble
if they sent you to me, darling.

1765
02:11:29,723 --> 02:11:33,018
That... is a twist.

1766
02:11:35,729 --> 02:11:36,730
What's your name?

1767
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:39,358
Aubrey.

1768
02:11:42,653 --> 02:11:44,071
Aubrey Argylle.
