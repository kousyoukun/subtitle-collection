no sign of Kuzco.

Are you talking
to that squirrel?

I was a junior chipmunk.

No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

doing in there?

No, Kuzco!

OK, I'll make it simple
for you.

342
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:46,989
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

343

- You got it?
- Can do.

Can I order the potatoes
as a side dish?

00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,599
I'll have to charge you
full price.

362

Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

363
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,889
You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

364
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,439
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.

coming up.

the cheese

it was our birthday

A big guy
and a skinny old woman.

scary beyond all reason?

Trust me, they're
not here to save you.

They'll take me back

Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

I can take it from here.

They're trying to kill you.

00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,919
So, remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

495
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,719
Why, I'm his
third cousin's brother's

496
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,139
wife's step-niece's
great-aunt. Heh heh.

497
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:13,389
Twice removed. [Sips]

498
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,519
Uh-huh.

499
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,519
Isn't that right, Kronk?

500
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:18,979
99 monkeys
jumping on the bed

501
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,069
One fell off
and bumped his head

502
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:25,899
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way,

503
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,699
but as I said to you before,

504
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,569
you may recall,
Pacha is not here.

505
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:32,159
I'll be sure and tell him
you came by.

506
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,369
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

507
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,869
Oops. Silly me.

508
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:41,339
No, no. Allow me.

509
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,679
She's hiding something.

510
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,179
When I give the word,
we search the house.

511
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,969
OK, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

512
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:52,559
Grr!

513
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,849
So, while we're
waiting for Paca--

514
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,519
Pacha.

515
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,019
Oh, yes.

516
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,519
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

517
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,519
You know, why don't
you just come back

518
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:05,069
when Pacha gets home?

519
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,199
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

520
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,199
[Stammers]
Excuse me, won't you?

521
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,079
I think I left
something in the oven.

522
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,039
This is my variation
of double-dutch.

523
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,499
On the signal,
we switch places.

524
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,959
Kronk, it's time!

525
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:18,909
ok!

526
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,709
Ohh!

527
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,629
So, we have to get
back to the palace,

528
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,209
find the lab,
and change him back.

529
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,249
Hi there!

530
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,259
Aah!

531
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,759
- That was him.
- Whoops.

532
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:31,719
You know what?

533
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,969
I don't believe you're
really my great-aunt.

534
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,269
You're more like
my great-great-great...

535
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:38,059
Go. I'll stall them
long enough

536
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,139
for you two to get
a head start.

537
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:40,639
Thanks, honey.

538
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,649
You have a lovely wife.

539
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:43,899
They're both very pretty.

540
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,109
Great-great-
great...

541
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:47,739
Grr! All right!

542
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,609
Are you through?

543
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:50,609
...great-great-aunt.

544
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:51,659
So, where were we?

545
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,119
Listen, sister, we're
not leaving until--

546
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,079
I show you the house.
Of course.

547
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,579
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

548
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,329
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

549
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,329
What do you mean,
the door is stuck?

550
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,039
Try jiggling the handle.

551
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,799
There is no handle
in here.

552
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,129
There's not?
Are you sure?

553
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,179
All right, I've had
enough of this.

554
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,179
Tell us where
the talking llama is

555
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:14,759
and we'll burn your house
to the ground.

556
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,469
Uh,
don't you mean "or"?

557
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,969
[Sighs] Tell us where
the talking llama is

558
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,059
or we'll burn your house
to the ground.

559
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,559
Well, which is it?

560
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,939
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

561
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,189
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!

562
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,189
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?

563
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,609
This is hand-carved
mahogany.

564
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,029
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.

565
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,449
I'll break it down myself.

566
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:35,829
Yzma: A-one

567
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:37,279
OK, kids,
you know what to do.

568
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:38,289


569
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,659
Right, Mom!

570
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:40,789
3!

571
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,419
Aah!

572
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,889
OK, children,
on your mark,

573
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,139
get set, go!

574
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,679
[Giggling]

575
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,479
Ow! Ow! Stop it,
you little brats! Huh?

576
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:03,979
Yzma: Ow!

577
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,729
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

578
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,989
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.

579
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,989
Let's not wait until
the next family reunion

580
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,279
to get together.

581
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,449
Yzma: Kronk!

582
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,079
I, uh, I gotta run.

583
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,889
[Thunder]

584
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,009
[Thunder]

585
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:28,559
OK, why does she even
have that lever?

586
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:30,059
[Yelps]

587
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:33,229
Skull:
Please remain seated

588
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,239
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

589
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,909
Aah!

590
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,449
Huh?

591
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,079
What does it look like?

592
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,579
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

593
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:46,909
Over here!

594
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,089
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

595
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,959
Yzma: Oh, my

596
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,589
Looking for this?

597
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:58,759
No! It can't be!

598
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,759
How did you get
back here before us?

599
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:04,349
Uh...how did we, Kronk?

600
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:05,849
Well, you got me.

601
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,769
By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

602
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,059
Oh, well,
back to business.

603
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,559
OK, I admit it.

604
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:13,729
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

605
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,569
but, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

606
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,109
Just think of it
as you're being let go,

607
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,199
that your life's going
in a different direction,

608
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,789
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

609
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,789
Hey, that's kind of like
what he said to you

610
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,039
when you got fired.

611
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,039
I know. It's called
a cruel irony--

612
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:34,039
like my dependence
on you.

613
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,709
I can't believe
this is happening!

614
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:38,049
Then I bet you weren't
expecting this

615
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:39,509
- No!
- Aah!

616
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,139
Aha!

617
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,639
[Sighs]
Oh, ok.

618
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,809
Ha ha!
Finish them off.

619
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,139
Kronk devil: Hey, you're
not backing down now,

620
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,059
are you, big guy?

621
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,229
Uh, where's the other guy?

622
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,229
Yo!

623
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,859
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?

624
00:24:57,989 --> 00:24:59,529
Well, Yzma just
tossed me this knife

625
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,949
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

626
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:04,869
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

627
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:05,949
and quite honestly--

628
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,829
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

629
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:10,329
This one simple thing.

630
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:11,829
It's like I'm talking
to a monkey.

631
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,999
Whoa now.

632
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:16,129
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

633
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:17,169
Ouch.

634
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,759
And do you want
to know something else?

635
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,339
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

636
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:22,889
Never!

That's it.

Now, now,
remember, guys.

From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

All: That'll work.

642
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,569
Strange.
That usually works.

00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:46,829
And so does this!

Ah. Should have
seen that coming.

Oof!.

Oops. Clumsy me.

Better hurry

was upside-down

822
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:16,679
And now
the world and me

823
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:19,269
We know you carry me

824
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:25,309
You see the patterns
in the big sky

825
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:31,239
Those constellations
look like you and I

826
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,079
Just like the patterns
in the big sky

827
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,419
We could be lost,
we could refuse to try

828
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:45,419
But we made it through

829
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:49,009
In the dark night

830
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:53,629
Who would those lucky guys
turn out to be

831
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,849
But that unusual blend

832
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:03,229
Of my funny friend
and me

833
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:11,529
I'm not as clever
as I thought I was

834
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:19,119
I'm not the boy
I used to be because

835
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:21,249
You show me
something different

836
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:25,039
You show me something pure

837
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,089
I always seemed so certain,
but I was really never sure

838
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:31,879
But you stayed

839
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:36,589
And you called my name

840
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,019
When others would have
walked out on a lousy game

841
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:46,229
And look
who made it through

842
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,519
But your funny friend
and me

843
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:53,529
You see the patterns
in the big sky

844
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:55,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah

845
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,369
Those constellations
look like you and I

846
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:06,079
That tiny planet
and the bigger guy

847
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:11,839
I don't know whether
I should laugh or cry

848
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:16,089
Chorus: Just like
the patterns in the big sky

849
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:18,049
We'll be together

850
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:21,139
We'll be together
till the end this time

851
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,599
You don't know,
you don't know

852
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,899
Don't know the answer
or the reason why

853
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,479
We'll stick together

854
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:35,359
We'll stick together
till the day we die

855
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:39,529
If I had to do this all
a second time

856
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:45,709
I won't complain
or make a fuss

857
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,709
Who would
the angels send

858
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:53,709
But that unlikely blend

859
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,129
Of those
2 funny friends

860
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,839
That's us
