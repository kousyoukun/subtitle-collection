Will you take a look at that?

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,320
Pretty pathetic, huh?

Well, you'll never
believe this,

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,160
but that llama
you're looking at

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,000

And not just
any human being

Oh, is that hard to believe?

You go back away--

I was a llama,

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,320
and this will all make sense

26
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,280
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back

27

Oh, ho! Look at me!

is he babbling about?

I threw off
the emperor's groove.

- What?
- His groove!

124

I threw it off,

127

and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

128

Don't throw off
his groove!

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,690
Oh, ok.

132
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,440
Beware the groove.

133
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey, are you
gonna be all right?

134

what I mean?

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,200
This guy's trouble,
but as bad as he is,

he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next

come here today?

Kuzco: OK, gang
Check out this piece of work

142
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,250
This is Yzma,

living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth

144

And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man

145
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,800
Every decade or so

Yeah, I got
that there, Yzma.

149
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,520
- Kronk: Unh!
- [Buzzing]

150
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,480
Kuzco: Yep, that's Kronk

151
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,610
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

152
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,030
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

153
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,110
and I’m thinking 
that's got to stop

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
It is no concern
of mine

155
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,330
whether your family
has...

156
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,490
What was it again?

157
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,120
Um, food.

158
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,370
Ha! You really should
have thought of that

159
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,250
before you
became peasants.

160
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,460
We're through here.

161
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,500
Take him away. Next!

162
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,210
But I--

163
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh, ok.

164
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,340
Ugh.

165
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,430
Kuzco: The nerve of some
of those peasants, huh?

166
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,760
Tell me about it.
Aah!

167
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,850
Hi there.

168
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,350
Ooh, Your Highness.

169
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,350
Ahem.

170
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,810
Oh, oh, oh,
ha ha ha. Um...

171
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,350
Uh, you were
doing it again.

172
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,530
Doing my job.

174
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,530
I'm the emperor,

175
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,110
and you're the emperor's
advisor.

176
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,110
Remember that?

177
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,360
But, Your Highness,

178
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,070
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

179
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,080
Kuzco: Whoa

180
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,950
Look at these wrinkles

181
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,000
What is holding
this woman together?

182
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,710
What the--

183
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,540
How long
has that been there?

184
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,090
Kronk:
Good thinking , Yzma

185
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,090
What do you say,
Kuzco?

186
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,590
Whoa! No touchy!

187
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,800
No touchy.
No touch.

188
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,930
Servant: Excuse me,
Your Highness

189
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,430
The village leader
is here to see you.

190
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,050
Oh, great.
Send him in.

191
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,600
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired.

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,850
Fired?

193
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,390
W-W-What do you mean,
fired?

194
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,600
Um, how else
can I say it?

195
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,100
You're being let go,

196

your department's
being downsized,

197
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,190
you're part of
an outplacement,

198
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,440
we're going in a
different direction,

199
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,530
we're not picking
up your option...

200
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,150
Take your pick.
I got more.

Uhh.

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,120
But--
But, Your Highness,

204
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,830
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

205
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,960
for--for--for
many, many years.

206
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,540
Hey, hey, everybody
hits their stride.

207
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,460
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

208
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,510
So...who's
in my chair?

209
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,510
Kronk:
Oh, oh! I know!

210
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,510
Yzma.

211
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,970
Yzma's in your
chair, right?

212
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,760
Very good, Kronk.

213
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,930
Here. Get the snack.

214
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,600
Got it!

215
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,970
Unh! Oof!.

216
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,970
OK, you heard
the man.

217
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,980
Up, up, up.

218
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,230
Kronk: I’m ok
I'm fine

219
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,650
[Snarling]

220
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,110
Ah.

221
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,530
ok. Show him in.

222
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,610
Ahem.

223
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,320
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.

224
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm here because
I received a summons--

225
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,160
Kuzco: Hey,
there he is!

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,080
My main village man.

227
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,580
Um, Pacha.

228
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,500
Anyway, I got
this summons--

229
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,000
Pacha.

230
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,460
That's right.

231
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,250
You are just the man
I wanted to see.

232
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,590
I am?

233
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,920
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

234
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,340
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

235
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,600
Sure.
I'll do what I can.

236
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,220
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

237
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,020
Are you aware of
just how important

238
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,430
your village is
to the empire?

239
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,310
Well, I know
we grow the crops

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,690
that you use here
at the palace.

241
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,610
We also herd the lamas
that you--

242
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,320
My village?

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,450
Oh, yeah.

244
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,570
You got a pretty sweet
little setup there

245
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,160
on top of that hill,
don't you? Ha ha ha!

246
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,660
Yeah. My family has
lived on that hilltop

247
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,960
for the last
6 generations.

248
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,290
Uh-huh.

249
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,830
So tell me,

250
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,130
where do you find
you get the most sun?

251
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,380
Oh, I'd say

252
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,590
just on the other side
of those trees.

253
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,840
When the sun hits
that ridge just right,

254
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,140
these hills sing.

255
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,470
Well, that settles it.

256
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,510
Really?

257
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
Yep. Problem solved.

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,970
Thanks for coming.

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,020
That's it?

260
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,520
That's all
you wanted me for?

261
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,650
I just needed
an insider's opinion

262
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,190
before I ok'd this spot
for my pool.

263
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,650
Uh...your pool?

264

Isn't it great?

It's my birthday gift

Uh...uh...

273

um...I don't understand
how this could happen.

274
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,300
Well, let me
clear it up for you.

275

At my birthday
celebration tomorrow,

276

I give the word,

277
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,090
and your town
will be destroyed

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,680
I got 3 good reasons why
you should just walk away.

496
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,680
" Number one..."

497
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,730
Look at that guy!

498
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,850
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

499
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,060
We've been
through this.

500
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,110
It's a harp,
and you know it.

501
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,980
Oh, right.
That's a harp...

502
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,030
and that's a dress.

503
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,280
Robe!

504
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,200
Reason number 2.

505
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,530
Look what
I can do.

506
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,700
Ha ha ha!

507
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,830
But... what does that
have to do with anything?

508
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,910
No, no.
He's got a point.

509
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,410
Listen, you guys.

510
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,290
You're sort of confusing me,
so be gone!

511
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,880
Uh, or, uh, you know.

512
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,500
However I get rid
of you guys.

513
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,420
That'll work.

514
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,280
Kuzco: Um, what's with
the chimp and the bug?

515
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,320
Can we get back tome?

516
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,620
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

517
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,870
What to do, what to do?

518
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,870
What do we do
with the body?

519
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,290
[Sighs]

520
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,130
What am I gonna
tell the village?

521
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,800
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.

522
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,090
Kronk: What do I
do? What do I do?

523
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,170
- Aah!
- [Mrreoww]

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,610
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

528
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,780
Kronk: Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.

529
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,320
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

530
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,910
Coming through.
Hey, you with the cart!

531
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,910
Kronk: Uh-oh

532
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,120
This is not good.

533
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,330
Uhh. Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

534
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,550
Tipo: Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

535
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,050
Measure me again!

536
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,720
Chicha: Ha!
All right, Tipo.

537
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,010
Stand still
and let's see.

538
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
Mom, you and I
both know

539
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,930
that it's
impossible for him

540
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,180
to have grown in
the last 5 minutes.

541
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,770
Mmm! Mmm!

542
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,190
Isn't it?

543
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,150
[Gasps] Look how much
you've grown!

544
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,190
What? Tipo, get
out of the way.

545
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,070
It's my turn again.
Measure me.

546
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,900
Dad's home!

Hey, ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!

[All Three Laughing]

551
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,910
Dad! I ate
a bug today!

552
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,540
Oh! Was Mom
baking again?

553
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,080
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.

554
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,330
Chicha:
I heard that.

555
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,380
OK, everybody,
move aside

556

Lady with a baby
coming through.

557
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,300
Dad, Dad, Dad!

558
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,880
Look at
how big I am!

559
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,090
We were all
measured today.

560
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,090
Oh.

561
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm going through
a growth spurt.

562
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,140
I'm as big
as you were

563
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,140
when you were me.

564
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,770
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

565
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,600
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

566
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,810
OK, ok, you two.

567
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,400
Our deal was that
you could stay awake

568
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,610
until Daddy came home.

569
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,650
Now say good night.

570
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,950
Both: Dad,
do we have to?

571
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,820
[Whimpering]

572
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,200
No, you two can stay up.

573
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,790
We're just gonna be sitting 
here telling each other

574
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,250
how much we love each other.

575

[Both Laughing]

580
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,000
So what did
the emperor want?

581
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,010
Ahem.

582
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,090
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

583
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,180
Couldn't see you?

584
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,630
- Why not?
- I don't know.

585
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,050
Well, that's
just rude.

586
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,470
Well, he is
the emperor.

587
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,470
I'm sure he's busy.

588
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,680
No, no, no, no. No.

589
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,100
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

Honey...

591
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,770
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

592
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,560
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

593
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,110
Sweetie, sweetie,
think of the baby.

Pacha, I'm fine.

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,280
This baby's not coming
for a while,

596
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,690
but even if it was,

597
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,610
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

598
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,490
That kind of behavior
just--just--

Hmm?

a little tired from the trip.

in the cart. Remember?

not him.

change me back,

827
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,290
and then I'll start
construction

828
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,840
on Kuzcotopia.

829
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
Oh, yeah.

830
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
OK, now, look,

831
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,380
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

832
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,720
Mm-hmm.

833
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,050
I just think if you really
thought about it,

834
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,220
you'd decide
to build your home

835
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,680
on a different hilltop.

836
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,770
And why would I
do that?

837
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,190
Because...

838
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,730
deep down,
I think you'll realize

839
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,360
that you're forcing
an entire village

840
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,230
out of their homes
just for you.

841
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,110
And that's...

842
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,110
bad?

843
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,660
[Laughs]
Well, yeah.

844
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,120
Nobody's
that heartless.

845
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,160
Mmm.

846
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,450
Now take me back.

847
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,500
What?
Wait, wait.

848
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,210
How can you
be this way?

849
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,040
All you care about
is building your summer home

850
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,880
and filling it
with stuff for you.

851
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,500
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.

852
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,800
Everyone else
in the kingdom gets it.

853
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,050
You're the only one
that doesn't seem to be

854
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,380
with the program,

855
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,800
eh, Pacha?

856
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,890
You know what?

857
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,010
Someday, you're going
to wind up all alone,

858
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,020
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

859
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,730
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.

860
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,230
Now, for the final time,

861
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,190
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

862
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,400
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here,

863

you change your mind,

Moo, moo, moo.

Huh? What?

869
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,160
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--

870
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,420
Somebody's
throwing stuff.

or what? What's going on?

He's never going
to change his mind.

Ohh. How am I ever going
to get out of here?

it is
with great sadness

879
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,170
that we mourn
the sudden departure

880

so tragically

on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

884

Poor little guy.

His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

886
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,060
He never had
a chance.

887
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,930
for all eternity.

Yzma:
Kronk, darling ,

893
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,330
I must admit
you had me worried

894
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,500
when you mixed up
those poisons,

895
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,170
but now that
Kuzco is dead,

896
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,710
all is forgiven.

897
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,460
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...

898
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,800
Heh. He's dead,
all right. Heh heh.

899
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,090
I mean, you can't get
much deader than he--

900
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,680
than he is right now.

901
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,020
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

902
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,980
I suppose.

and a 31 waist.

Kuzco is dead, right?

Tell me Kuzco's dead.

Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

He's still alive?

Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

I'd give you the heads-up

ever came back.

He can't come back!

Yeah. That would be
kind of awkward--

out of control

Well, 4 days
is a long time.

Who knows? Maybe
you'll change your mind.

Uh-huh.

What are the chances
of you carrying me?

Not good.

no sign of Kuzco.

Are you talking
to that squirrel?

I was a junior chipmunk.

and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

OK, I'll make it simple
for you.

1331

I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

I'll have to charge you
full price.

Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,660
You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

1353
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,210
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.

Cheddar spuds
coming up.

the cheese

it was our birthday

A big guy
and a skinny old woman.

scary beyond all reason?

not here to save you.

You've been great.

I can take it from here.

stop at the house

1472
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,840
and get some supplies.

1473
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,470
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

1474
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,590
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1475
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,640
My relatives?

1476
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,060
We just sent them
up to your house.

1477
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,850
What did
they look like?

1478
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,850
See, there was
this big guy

1479
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,270
and this older woman
who was...

1480
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,350
How would
you describe her?

1481
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,940
Scary beyond all reason.

1482
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,400
Yeah, that's it.

1483
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,690
So, remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

1484
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,490
Why, I'm his
third cousin's brother's

1485
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,910
wife's step-niece's
great-aunt. Heh heh.

1486
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,160
Twice removed. [Sips]

1487
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,290
Uh-huh.

1488
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,290
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1489
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,750
99 monkeys
jumping on the bed

1490
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,840
One fell off
and bumped his head

1491
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,670
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way,

1492
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,470
but as I said to you before,

1493
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,340
you may recall,
Pacha is not here.

1494
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,930
I'll be sure and tell him
you came by.

1495
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:01,140
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1496
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,640
Oops. Silly me.

1497
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,110
No, no. Allow me.

1498
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,450
She's hiding something.

1499
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,950
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1500
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,740
OK, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

1501
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,330
Grr!

1502
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,620
So, while we're
waiting for Paca--

1503
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,290
Pacha.

1504
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,790
Oh, yes.

1505
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,290
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1506
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,290
You know, why don't
you just come back

1507
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,840
when Pacha gets home?

1508
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,970
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

1509
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,970
[Stammers]
Excuse me, won't you?

1510
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,850
I think I left
something in the oven.

1511
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,810
This is my variation
of double-dutch.

1512
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,270
On the signal,
we switch places.

1513
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,730
Kronk, it's time!

1514
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:43,680
ok!

1515
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,480
Ohh!

1516
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,400
So, we have to get
back to the palace,

1517
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,980
find the lab,
and change him back.

1518
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,020
Hi there!

1519
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,030
Aah!

1520
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,530
- That was him.
- Whoops.

1521
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,490
You know what?

1522
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,740
I don't believe you're
really my great-aunt.

1523
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,040
You're more like
my great-great-great...

1524
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,830
Go. I'll stall them
long enough

1525
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,910
for you two to get
a head start.

1526
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,410
Thanks, honey.

1527
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,420
You have a lovely wife.

1528
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,670
They're both very pretty.

1529
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,880
Great-great-
great...

1530
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,510
Grr! All right!

1531
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,380
Are you through?

1532
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:15,380
...great-great-aunt.

1533
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,430
So, where were we?

1534
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,890
Listen, sister, we're
not leaving until--

1535
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,850
I show you the house.
Of course.

1536
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,350
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1537
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,100
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1538
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,100
What do you mean,
the door is stuck?

1539
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,810
Try jiggling the handle.

1540
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,570
There is no handle
in here.

1541
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,900
There's not?
Are you sure?

1542
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,950
All right, I've had
enough of this.

1543
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,950
Tell us where
the talking llama is

1544
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,530
and we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1545
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,240
Uh,
don't you mean "or"?

1546
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,740
[Sighs] Tell us where
the talking llama is

1547
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,830
or we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1548
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,330
Well, which is it?

1549
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,710
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1550
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,960
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!

1551
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,960
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?

1552
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,380
This is hand-carved
mahogany.

1553
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,800
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.

1554
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,220
I'll break it down myself.

1555
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,600
Yzma: A-one

1556
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,050
OK, kids,
you know what to do.

1557
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,060
2

1558
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,430
Right, Mom!

1559
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,560
3!

1560
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,190
Aah!

1561
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,660
OK, children,
on your mark,

1562
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,910
get set, go!

1563
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,450
[Giggling]

1564
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,250
Ow! Ow! Stop it,
you little brats! Huh?

1565
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,750
Yzma: Ow!

1566
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:32,500
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1567
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,760
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.

1568
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,760
Let's not wait until
the next family reunion

1569
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,050
to get together.

1570
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,220
Yzma: Kronk!

1571
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,850
I, uh, I gotta run.

1572
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,660
[Thunder]

1573
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,780
[Thunder]

1574
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,330
OK, why does she even
have that lever?

1575
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,830
[Yelps]

1576
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,000
Skull:
Please remain seated

1577
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,010
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

1578
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,680
Aah!

1579
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,220
Huh?

1580
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,850
What does it look like?

1581
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,350
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

1582
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,680
Over here!

1583
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:15,860
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1584
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,730
Yzma: Oh, my

1585
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,360
Looking for this?

1586
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:23,530
No! It can't be!

1587
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,530
How did you get
back here before us?

1588
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:29,120
Uh...how did we, Kronk?

1589
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,620
Well, you got me.

1590
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,540
By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

1591
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,830
Oh, well,
back to business.

1592
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,330
OK, I admit it.

1593
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,500
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1594
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,340
but, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

1595
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:44,880
Just think of it
as you're being let go,

1596
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,970
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1597
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:50,560
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1598
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,560
Hey, that's kind of like
what he said to you

1599
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:53,810
when you got fired.

1600
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,810
I know. It's called
a cruel irony--

1601
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,810
like my dependence
on you.

1602
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,480
I can't believe
this is happening!

1603
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,820
Then I bet you weren't
expecting this

1604
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,280
- No!
- Aah!

1605
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,910
Aha!

1606
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,410
[Sighs]
Oh, ok.

1607
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,580
Ha ha!
Finish them off.

1608
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,910
Kronk devil: Hey, you're
not backing down now,

1609
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,830
are you, big guy?

1610
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,000
Uh, where's the other guy?

1611
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,000
Yo!

1612
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,630
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?

1613
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,300
Well, Yzma just
tossed me this knife

1614
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,720
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1615
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,640
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1616
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,720
and quite honestly--

1617
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,600
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1618
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,100
This one simple thing.

1619
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,600
It's like I'm talking
to a monkey.

1620
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,770
Whoa now.

1621
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,900
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1622
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:41,940
Ouch.

1623
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,530
And do you want
to know something else?

1624
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,110
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

1625
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,660
Never!

1626
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,870
[Sobs]

1627
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,700
That's it.
She's going down.

1628
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,700
Now, now,

1792
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,500
I'm so proud of you guys.

1793
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,630
Sting: In the quiet time
of evening

1794
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:30,930
When the stars
assume their patterns

1795
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:36,680
And the day
has made his journey

1796
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:43,480
And we wondered
just what happened

1797
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,360
To the life we knew

1798
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:49,280
Before the world
changed

1799
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:52,580
When not a thing I had

1800
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,870
Was true

1801
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,870
Was true

1802
01:12:57,330 --> 01:13:00,250
But you were kind to me

1803
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:03,250
And you reminded me

1804
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:07,840
That the world
is not my playground

1805
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,890
There are other things
that matter

1806
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,770
And what is simple
needs protecting

1807
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:26,400
Or my illusions
all would shatter

1808
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,320
But you stayed

1809
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:33,280
In my corner

1810
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:37,750
The only world I know
was upside-down

1811
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,250
And now
the world and me

1812
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,840
We know you carry me

1813
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:51,880
You see the patterns
in the big sky

1814
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:57,810
Those constellations
look like you and I

1815
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:03,650
Just like the patterns
in the big sky

1816
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:08,990
We could be lost,
we could refuse to try

1817
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,990
But we made it through

1818
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:15,580
In the dark night

1819
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:20,200
Who would those lucky guys
turn out to be

1820
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:25,420
But that unusual blend

1821
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,800
Of my funny friend
and me

1822
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:38,100
I'm not as clever
as I thought I was

1823
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:45,690
I'm not the boy
I used to be because

1824
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,820
You show me
something different

1825
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,610
You show me something pure

1826
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:56,660
I always seemed so certain,
but I was really never sure

1827
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,450
But you stayed

1828
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,160
And you called my name

1829
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:07,590
When others would have
walked out on a lousy game

1830
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,800
And look
who made it through

1831
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,090
But your funny friend
and me

1832
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:20,100
You see the patterns
in the big sky

1833
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1834
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:26,940
Those constellations
look like you and I

1835
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:32,650
That tiny planet
and the bigger guy

1836
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:38,410
I don't know whether
I should laugh or cry

1837
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:42,660
Chorus: Just like
the patterns in the big sky

1838
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,620
We'll be together

1839
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,710
We'll be together
till the end this time

1840
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,170
You don't know,
you don't know

1841
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,470
Don't know the answer
or the reason why

1842
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,050
We'll stick together

1843
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:01,930
We'll stick together
till the day we die

1844
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:06,100
If I had to do this all
a second time

1845
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,280
I won't complain
or make a fuss

1846
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Who would
the angels send

1847
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,280
But that unlikely blend

1848
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,700
Of those
2 funny friends

1849
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:26,410
That's u
