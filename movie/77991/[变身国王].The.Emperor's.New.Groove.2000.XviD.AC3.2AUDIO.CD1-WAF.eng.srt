of trying to run the country
behind my back,

and I’m thinking 
that's got to stop

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,850
Ahem.

170
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,310
Oh, oh, oh,
ha ha ha. Um...

171
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,850
Uh, you were
doing it again.

172
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,820
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?

173
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,030
Doing my job.

174
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm the emperor,

175
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,610
and you're the emperor's
advisor.

176
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,610
Remember that?

177
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,860
But, Your Highness,

178
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,570
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

179
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,580
Kuzco: Whoa

180
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,450
Look at these wrinkles

181
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,500
What is holding
this woman together?

182
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,210
What the--

183
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,040
How long
has that been there?

184
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,590
Kronk:
Good thinking , Yzma

185
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,590
What do you say,
Kuzco?

186
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,090
Whoa! No touchy!

187
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,300
No touchy.
No touch.

188

Servant: Excuse me,
Your Highness

189
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,930
The village leader
is here to see you.

190
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,550
Oh, great.
Send him in.

191
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,100
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired.

192
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,350
Fired?

193
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,890
W-W-What do you mean,
fired?

194
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,100
Um, how else
can I say it?

195
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,600
You're being let go,

196

your department's
being downsized,

197
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,690
you're part of
an outplacement,

198
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,940
we're going in a
different direction,

199

we're not picking
up your option...

200
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,650
Take your pick.
I got more.

Uhh.

But--
But, Your Highness,

204
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,330
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

205
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,460
for--for--for
many, many years.

206
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,040
Hey, hey, everybody
hits their stride.

207
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,960
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

208
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,010
So...who's
in my chair?

209
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,010
Kronk:
Oh, oh! I know!

210
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,010
Yzma.

211
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,470
Yzma's in your
chair, right?

212
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,260
Very good, Kronk.

213
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,430
Here. Get the snack.

214
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,100
Got it!

215
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,470
Unh! Oof!.

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,470
OK, you heard
the man.

217
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,480
Up, up, up.

218
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,730
Kronk: I’m ok
I'm fine

219

[Snarling]

220
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,610
Ah.

221
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,030
ok. Show him in.

222
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,110
Ahem.

223
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,820
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.

224
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,660
I'm here because
I received a summons--

225
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,660
Kuzco: Hey,
there he is!

226
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,580
My main village man.

227
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,080
Um, Pacha.

228
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Anyway, I got
this summons--

229
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,500
Pacha.

230
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,960
That's right.

231
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,750
You are just the man
I wanted to see.

232
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,090
I am?

233
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,420
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

234
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,840
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

235
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,100
Sure.
I'll do what I can.

236
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,720
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

237
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,520
Are you aware of
just how important

238
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,930
your village is
to the empire?

239
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,810
Well, I know
we grow the crops

240
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,190
that you use here
at the palace.

241
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,110
We also herd the lamas
that you--

242
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,820
My village?

243
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,950
Oh, yeah.

244
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,070
You got a pretty sweet
little setup there

245
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,660
on top of that hill,
don't you? Ha ha ha!

246
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,160
Yeah. My family has
lived on that hilltop

247
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,460
for the last
6 generations.

248
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,790
Uh-huh.

249
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,330
So tell me,

250
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,630
where do you find
you get the most sun?

251
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,880
Oh, I'd say

252
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,090
just on the other side
of those trees.

253
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,340
When the sun hits
that ridge just right,

254
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,640
these hills sing.

255
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,970
Well, that settles it.

256
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,010
Really?

257
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,260
Yep. Problem solved.

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,470
Thanks for coming.

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,520
That's it?

260
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,020
That's all
you wanted me for?

261
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,150
I just needed
an insider's opinion

262
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,690
before I ok'd this spot
for my pool.

263
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,150
Uh...your pool?

264

Isn't it great?

It's my birthday gift
to me. Ha!

I'm so happy.

Uh...uh...

273

um...I don't understand
how this could happen.

274
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,800
Well, let me
clear it up for you.

275
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,920
At my birthday
celebration tomorrow,

276

I give the word,

277
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,590
and your town
will be destroyed

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,230
Look at that guy!

498
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,350
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

499
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,560
We've been
through this.

500
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,610
It's a harp,
and you know it.

501
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,480
Oh, right.
That's a harp...

502
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,530
and that's a dress.

503
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,780
Robe!

504
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,700
Reason number 2.

505
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,030
Look what
I can do.

506
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,200
Ha ha ha!

507
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,330
But... what does that
have to do with anything?

508
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,410
No, no.
He's got a point.

509
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,910
Listen, you guys.

510
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,790
You're sort of confusing me,
so be gone!

511
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,380
Uh, or, uh, you know.

512
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,000
However I get rid
of you guys.

513
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,920
That'll work.

514
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,780
Kuzco: Um, what's with
the chimp and the bug?

515
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,820
Can we get back tome?

516
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,120
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

517
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,370
What to do, what to do?

518
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,370
What do we do
with the body?

519

[Sighs]

520
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,630
What am I gonna
tell the village?

521
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,300
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.

522
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,590
Kronk: What do I
do? What do I do?

523
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,670
- Aah!

Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

528
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,280
Kronk: Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.

529
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,820
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

530
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,410
Coming through.
Hey, you with the cart!

531

Kronk: Uh-oh

532
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,620
This is not good.

533
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,830
Uhh. Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

534

Tipo: Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

535
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,550
Measure me again!

536
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,220
Chicha: Ha!
All right, Tipo.

537
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,510
Stand still
and let's see.

538
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
Mom, you and I
both know

539
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,430
that it's
impossible for him

540
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,680
to have grown in
the last 5 minutes.

541
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,270
Mmm! Mmm!

542
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,690
Isn't it?

543
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,650
[Gasps] Look how much
you've grown!

544
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,690
What? Tipo, get
out of the way.

545
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,570
It's my turn again.
Measure me.

546
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,400
Dad's home!

[All Three Laughing]

551
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,410
Dad! I ate
a bug today!

552
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh! Was Mom
baking again?

553
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,580
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.

554
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,830
Chicha:
I heard that.

555
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
OK, everybody,
move aside

Lady with a baby
coming through.

557
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,800
Dad, Dad, Dad!

558
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,380
Look at
how big I am!

559
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,590
We were all
measured today.

560
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,590
Oh.

561
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,180
I'm going through
a growth spurt.

562
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,640
I'm as big
as you were

563
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,640
when you were me.

564
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,270
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

565
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,100
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

566
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,310
OK, ok, you two.

567
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,900
Our deal was that
you could stay awake

568
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,110
until Daddy came home.

569
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,150
Now say good night.

570
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,450
Both: Dad,
do we have to?

571
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,320
[Whimpering]

572
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,700
No, you two can stay up.

573
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,290
We're just gonna be sitting 
here telling each other

574
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,750
how much we love each other.

575
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,830

[Both Laughing]

580
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,500
So what did
the emperor want?

581
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,510
Ahem.

582
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,590
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

583
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,680
Couldn't see you?

584
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,130
- Why not?
- I don't know.

585
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,550
Well, that's
just rude.

586
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,970
Well, he is
the emperor.

587
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,970
I'm sure he's busy.

588
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,180
No, no, no, no. No.

589
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,600
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

590
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,690
Honey...

591
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,270
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

592
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,060
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

593
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,610
Sweetie, sweetie,
think of the baby.

594

Pacha, I'm fine.

595
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,780
This baby's not coming
for a while,

596
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,190
but even if it was,

597
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,110
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

598
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,990
That kind of behavior
just--just--

599
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,080
Uhh! [Snarls]

wash something.

You ok?

Hmm?

Oh, yeah. I'm just
a little tired from the trip.

put Misty away.

Um, I'm the one
in the cart. Remember?

609
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,080
This story's about me,
not him.

ok. You got it?
All right.

No touchy.

Aah! Demon llama!

look like

look like the emperor?

figure that out, ok?

anything.

I remember you.

telling you

that I was

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,340
Oh, yeah.

830
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,380
OK, now, look,

831
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,880
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

832
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,220
Mm-hmm.

833
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,550
I just think if you really
thought about it,

834
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,720
you'd decide
to build your home

835
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,180
on a different hilltop.

836
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,270
And why would I
do that?

837
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,690
Because...

838
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,230
deep down,
I think you'll realize

839
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,860
that you're forcing
an entire village

840
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,730
out of their homes
just for you.

841
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,610
And that's...

842
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,610
bad?

843
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,160
[Laughs]
Well, yeah.

844
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,620
Nobody's
that heartless.

845
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,660
Mmm.

846
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,950
Now take me back.

847
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,000
What?
Wait, wait.

848
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,710
How can you
be this way?

849
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,540
All you care about
is building your summer home

850
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,380
and filling it
with stuff for you.

851
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,000
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.

852
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,300
Everyone else
in the kingdom gets it.

853
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,550
You're the only one
that doesn't seem to be

854
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,880
with the program,

855
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,300
eh, Pacha?

856
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,390
You know what?

857
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,510
Someday, you're going
to wind up all alone,

858
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,520
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

859
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,230
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.

860
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,730
Now, for the final time,

861
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,690
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

862
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,900
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here,

863
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,190
because unless
you change your mind,

864

I'm not taking you back.

you change your mind,

I'm not

Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

868
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,830
Huh? What?

869
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,660
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--

870
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,920
Somebody's
throwing stuff.

871
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,880
You going to build a fire
or what? What's going on?

He's never going
to change his mind.

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,050
Ohh. How am I ever going
to get out of here?

878
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,500
it is
with great sadness

879
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,670
that we mourn
the sudden departure

880
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,250
of our beloved prince...

so tragically

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,630
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

884
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,930
Poor little guy.

885
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,260
His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

886
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,560
He never had
a chance.

887
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,430
for all eternity.

Yzma:
Kronk, darling ,

893
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,830
I must admit
you had me worried

894
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,000
when you mixed up
those poisons,

895
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,670
but now that
Kuzco is dead,

896
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,210
all is forgiven.

897
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,960
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...

898
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,300
Heh. He's dead,
all right. Heh heh.

899
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,590
I mean, you can't get
much deader than he--

900
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,180
than he is right now.

901
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,520
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

902
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,480
I suppose.

903

I'm kind of hard to fit.

I wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist.

908

Kuzco is dead, right?

909
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,910
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

I need to hear
these words.

Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

912

He's still alive?

913
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,960
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

I'd give you the heads-up

in case Kuzco
ever came back.

He can't come back!

Yeah. That would be
kind of awkward--

especially after
that lovely eulogy.

You and I are going out
to find him.

we are through!

Dad was tied to a log

and was careening
out of control

down a raging river
of death!

That's right.

would ever happen.
