00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,791
Will you take a look at that?
Pretty pathetic, huh?

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,993
Well, you'll never believe this,
but that llama you're looking at
was once a human being.

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,237
And not just any human being.
That guy was an emperor.

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,113
A rich, powerful ball of charisma.
Oh, yeah!

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,759
This is his story.
Well, actually, my story.

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,394
That's right...
I'm that llama.

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,750
The name is Kuzco...

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,110
Emperor Kuzco.

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,869
I was the world's nicest guy,
and they ruined my life for no reason.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,831
Oh, is that hard to believe?
Look, I tell you what.

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,318
You go back a ways,
you know, before I was a llama,
and this will all make sense.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,035
All right, now see. That's a little
too far back. Oh! Look at me.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,957
That's me as a baby.

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,629
Ahem.
All right, let's move ahead.

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,112
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- There are despots and dictators</i>

Okay, this is the real me.
Not this.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,915
This. Not this.
Winner. Loser.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,511
Okay, see this palace? Everyone in
it is at my command. Check this out.

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,110
Butler. Chef.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,798
Theme song guy.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,957
Oh, yeah!
<i>He's the sovereign lord of the nation</i>

<i>Kuzco</i>

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,232
<i>- That's his name</i>
<i>- Kuzco</i>

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,194
<i>- He's the king of the world</i>
<i>- Kuzco</i>

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,837
<i>Yeah</i>

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,077
You threw off my groove!

45
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,954
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off
the emperor's groove.

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,595
- Sorry!
- You were saying?

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,793
<i>What's his name</i>
<i>Kuzco</i>

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,037
<i>Kuzco</i>

<i>- That's his name</i>

<i>- Whoa, yeah</i>

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,437
Boom, baby!

55
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,795
Your Highness, it is time for you
to choose your bride.

56
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,310
All righty.
Trot out the ladies.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,149
Let's take a look-see.
Hate your hair. Not likely.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,511
Yikes, yikes, yikes.
And let me guess.

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,599
You have a great personality.
Is this really the best you could do?

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,870
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I-I mean, p-perhaps...

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,312
What is he babbling about? He's like
the thing that wouldn't shut up.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,513
Anyway, still wondering about
that llama in the opening?

63
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,949
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life.

64
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,991
First, there's Pacha.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,715
Uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Emperor
Kuzco. You see, I got this summons.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,515
Inside, up the stairs
and to the left. Just follow the signs.

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,110
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,391
Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look.

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,598
- Uh, pardon me. That's mine.
- Oh, here you go.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,439
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,393
- Oh, hey. Are you all right?
Here. Let me, uh...
- Oh, you're so very kind.

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,476
- What happened?
- Well, I...

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,477
I threw off the emperor's groove.

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,388
- What?
- His groove, the rhythm
in which he lives his life,
his pattern of behavior.

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,308
I threw it off, and the emperor
had me thrown out the window.

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,433
- Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.
- Don't throw off his groove!

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
- Oh, okay.
- Beware the groove.

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,118
- Hey, are you gonna be all right?
- Groove.

79
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,673
You see what I mean?

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,839
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is,
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,195
And why have you come here today?

82
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,676
Well, Y-Your Highness...
I mean, Your Grace.

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,030
Okay, gang.
Check out this piece of work.

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,038
This is Yzma,
the emperor's advisor...

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,958
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth.

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,355
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man.

87
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,995
Every decade or so she gets a new one.
This year's model is called Kronk.

88
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,715
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,990
Yep, that's Kronk.

90
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,509
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit...

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,790
of trying to run the country
behind my back...

92
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,831
and I'm thinkin'
that's got to stop.

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,918
It is no concern of mine
whether your family has...

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,600
- What was it again?
- Um, food.

95
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,554
Ha! You really should have thought
of that before you became peasants.

96
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,672
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,837
But I...
Oh, okay.

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,396
The nerve of some
of those peasants, huh?

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,476
Tell me about it.

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,955
- Hi there.
- Oh, Your Highness.

101
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,552
- Uh, you were doing it again.
- Doing? Doing... Doing... Doing what?

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,196
Doing my job. I'm the emperor and you're
the emperor's advisor. Remember that?

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,949
But, Your Highness, I was only dealing
with meaningless peasant matters.

104
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,119
Whoa.
Look at these wrinkles.

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,993
What is holding
this woman together?

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,032
What the... How long
has that been there?

107
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,469
Good thinkin', Yzma.
What do you say, Kuzco?

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,036
Whoa! No touchy!
No touchy. No touch.

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,515
Uh, excuse me, Your Highness.
The village leader is here to see you.

110
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,552
Oh, great. Send him in.
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,229
Fired?
W-W-What do you mean, fired?

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,794
Um, how else can I say it?
You're being let go...

113
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,798
your department's being downsized,
you're part of an outplacement...

114
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,990
we're going in a different direction,
we're not picking up your option.

115
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,715
- Take your pick. I got more.
- But I... You, uh...

116
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,748
But... But, Your Highness, I have been
nothing if not loyal to the empire...

117
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,917
for-for-for many, many years.

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,554
Hey, everybody
hits their stride.

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,148
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

120
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,113
So, who's in my chair?

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,437
Oh, oh! I know! Yzma.
Yzma's in your chair, right?

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,950
- Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.
- Got it.

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,077
Okay, you heard the man.
Up, up, up.

124
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,270
I'm okay. I'm fine.

125
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,277
Okay. Show him in.

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,915
Uh, afternoon, Your Highness.
I'm here because I received a summons...

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,429
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

128
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,752
Um, Pacha.
Anyway, I-I got this summons...

129
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,348
Pacha. That's right.

130
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,552
- You are just the man I wanted to see.
- I am?

131
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,274
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

132
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,070
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,270
Sure. I'll do what I can.

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,039
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

135
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,993
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,271
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

137
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,755
We also herd the llamas that you...

138
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,435
- My village?
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,076
You got a pretty sweet little set-up
there on top of that hill, don't you?

140
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,557
Yeah. My family has lived on that
hilltop for the last six generations.

141
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,274
Uh-huh.
So tell me...

142
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,470
where do you find
you get the most sun?

143
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,752
Oh, I-I'd say just on
the other side of those trees.

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,192
When the sun hits that ridge
just right, these hills sing.

145
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,117
- Well, that settles it.
- Really?

146
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,834
Yep. Problem solved.
Thanks for coming.

147
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,235
That's it?
That's all you wanted me for?

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,717
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okayed this spot for my pool.

149
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,550
- Uh, your pool?
- Boo-yah! Welcome to Kuzcotopia...

150
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,639
my ultimate summer getaway,
complete with water slide.

151
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,639
- What?
- Isn't it great?
It's my birthday gift to me.

152
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,352
I'm so happy.

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,196
I don't understand
how this could happen.

154
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,915
Well, let me clear it up for you.
At my birthday celebration tomorrow...

155
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,713
I give the word,
and your town will be destroyed...

156
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,751
to make way for this.

157
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,073
So, if I were you, I'd pick up
some change-of-address forms
on the way home.

158
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,668
But-But, um, where will we live?

159
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,633
Hmm.
Don't know, don't care.

160
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,228
- How's that?
- Oh, but wait. You can't...

161
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,112
When I give the word...

162
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,835
your little town thingy
will be bye-bye.

163
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,032
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, w-wait. No...

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,073
Boo-hoo. Oh, yeah.
Everything was goin' my way.

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,912
Or so I thought.

166
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,957
He can't get rid of me
that easily.

167
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,631
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is? Does he...

168
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,149
a little to the left...

169
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,033
have any idea of
who he's dealing with?

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,994
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

171
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,795
- Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.
- Yeah, go figure.

172
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,751
Well, it's better you're
takin' out your anger...

173
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,838
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco, huh?

174
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,916
That's it, Kronk!
That's it!

175
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,793
I'll get rid of Kuzco.

176
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,993
- The real Kuzco?
- Of course the real Kuzco.

177
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,917
Don't you see?
It's perfect.

178
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,190
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne...

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,790
I'll take over and rule the empire.

180
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,799
- Brilliant!
- So how does that work
with you bein' fired and all?

181
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,038
The only ones who know about
that are the three of us,
soon to be the two of us.

182
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,991
And I'm one of
those two, right?

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,037
To the secret lab!

184
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,714
Pull the lever, Kronk.

185
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,150
- Wrong lever!
- Huh?

186
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,396
Why do we even
have that lever?

187
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,557
Get out of my way!

188
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,595
<i>Please remain seated and keep your arms</i>
<i>and legs in at all times.</i>

189
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,915
Faster, faster!

190
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,315
Yzma, put your hands
in the air!

191
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,833
Ah, how shall I do it?
Oh, I know.

192
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,396
I'll turn him into a flea,
a harmless little flea...

193
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,195
and then I'll put that flea in a box
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box...

194
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,199
and then I'll mail that box
to myself, and when it arrives...

195
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,880
I'll smash it with a hammer!

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,276
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant,
I tell you! Genius, I say!

197
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,949
Or, to save on postage,
I'll just poison him with this.

198
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,709
Take it, Kronk.
Feel the power.

199
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,831
Oh, I can feel it.

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,951
Our moment of
triumph approaches.

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,591
It's dinnertime.

202
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,393
So, is everything
ready for tonight?

203
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,308
Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off
with soup and a light salad,
and then see how we feel after that.

204
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,671
Not the dinner.
The, you know...

205
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,995
Oh, right.
The poison...

206
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,669
The poison for Kuzco, the poison
chosen especially to kill Kuzco...

207
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,030
Kuzco's poison.

208
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,912
- That poison?
- Yes! That poison.

209
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,156
- Got you covered.
- Excellent.

210
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,352
A few drops in his drink,
and then I'll propose a toast...

211
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,311
and he will be dead before dessert.

212
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,750
Which is a real shame,
because it's gonna be delicious.

213
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,314
Boom, bam, baby!
Let's get to the grub.

214
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,830
I am one hungry
king of the world.

215
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,999
So, no hard feelings
about being let go?

216
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,429
None whatsoever.

217
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,155
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.

218
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,033
Drink. Right.

219
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,509
Your Highness.

220
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,359
- Is something burning?
- My spinach puffs!

221
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,194
So, he seems nice.

222
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,312
H-He is.

223
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,432
He's what,
in his late twenties?

224
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,030
- I'm not sure.
- Saved 'em!

225
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,071
- That's great. Good job.
- Great! Very good job.

226
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,078
Watch it.
They're still hot.

227
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,629
Kronk.
The emperor needs his drink.

228
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,911
Right. Oh. Right.

229
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,594
Hey, Kronky,
everything okay back there?

230
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,110
Well... Oh, uh...

231
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,993
The drinks were a bit on the...

232
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,839
oh, uh, warm side.

233
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,670
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.

234
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,234
Yes, Kronk. Riveting.

235
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,954
A toast to the emperor!

236
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,071
Long live Kuzco!

237
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,589
Don't drink the wine.
Poison.

238
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,840
Ah! Tasty.

239
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,879
Finally!
Good work, Kronk.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,355
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.

241
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,472
Now to get rid of the body.

242
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,397
Okay! What were we saying?

243
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,751
Uh, uh, w-we were just
making a toast...

244
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,396
to your long and healthy rule.

245
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,273
Right. So what are you gonna do?

246
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,630
I mean, you've been
around here a long time and...

247
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,832
I really mean a long time.

248
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,669
I mean, it might be difficult
for someone of your age...

249
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,597
adjusting to life
in the private sector.

250
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,191
Hey, Kronk, can you
top me off, pal? Be a friend?

251
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,313
- Now, about you finding new work,
that's-that's gonna be tough.
- Hit him on the head.

252
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,352
- More broccoli?
- Because you're, you know...

253
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,314
Let's face it. You're no
spring chicken, and I mean that
in the best possible way.

254
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,394
What? A llama?

255
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,397
He's supposed to be dead!

256
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,909
Yeah, weird.

257
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,349
Let me see that vial.

258
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,557
This isn't poison.

259
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,673
This is extract of llama.

260
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,155
You know, in my defense,
your poisons all look alike.

261
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,316
You might think about
relabeling some of them.

262
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,752
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

263
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,396
- What about dinner?
- Kronk, this is kind of important.

264
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,150
- How about dessert?
- Well, I suppose there's time
for dessert.

265
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,716
- And coffee?
- All right. A quick cup of coffee.

266
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,673
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

267
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,710
Guess where I am right now.
Uh-huh. In the bag.

268
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,674
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.

269
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,597
Hey!

270
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,790
He's doing his own theme music?

271
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,551
Big, dumb and tone deaf.

272
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,195
I am so glad I was unconscious
for all of this.

273
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,354
Mission accomplished.

274
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,469
- You're not just gonna let him
die like that, are you?
- My shoulder angel.

275
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,310
Don't listen to that guy. He's trying to
lead you down the path of righteousness.

276
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,113
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

277
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,356
- Oh, come off it.
- You come off it!

278
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,596
- You.
- You.
- You.
- You infinity.

279
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,189
Listen up, big guy. I got three good
reasons why you should just walk away.

280
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,151
Number one...
Look at that guy!

281
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,191
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

282
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,312
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.

283
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,591
Oh, right. That's a harp
and that's a dress.

284
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,109
- Robe!
- Reason number two...

285
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,515
Look what I can do.

286
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,631
But what does that
have to do with anything?

287
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,070
- No, no. He's got a point.
- Listen, you guys.

288
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,637
You're sort of confusing me,
so, uh, begone! Uh... Or, uh, you know.

289
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,718
- However I get rid of you guys.
- That'll work.

290
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,598
Um, what's with the chimp and the bug?
Can we get back to me?

291
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,748
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

292
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,872
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?

293
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,550
What am I gonna
tell the village?

294
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,639
Come on, Kronky. Come on, Kronky.
Okay. What do I do? What do I do?

295
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,233
Back! Elbow! Shoulder!

296
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,351
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

297
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,916
Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me. Stop!
Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry about that.

298
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,395
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!

299
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,351
Uh-oh.

300
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,436
This is not good.

301
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,596
Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

302
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,679
Mom! Mom! I think I'm still growing!
Measure me again!

303
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,836
All right, Tipo.
Stand still and let's see.

304
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
Mom, you and I both know
that it's impossible for him...

305
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,394
to have grown in
the last five minutes.

306
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,637
- Isn't it?
- Look how much you've grown.

307
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,557
What? Tipo, get out of the way.

308
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,150
- It's my turn again. Measure me.
- Dad's home.

309
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,755
Hey!

310
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,677
Come here.

311
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,750
- Dad! I ate a bug today!
- Oh! Was Mom baking again?

312
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,996
- Don't tell her I said that.
- I heard that.

313
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,917
Okay, everybody, move aside.

314
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,395
Lady with a baby
comin' through.

315
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,239
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Look at how big I am.

316
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,351
- We were all measured today.
- Oh.

317
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,234
I'm going through a growth spurt.
I'm as big as you were when you were me.

318
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,713
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

319
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,118
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

320
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,631
Okay, okay, you two.
Our deal was that you could
stay awake until Daddy came home.

321
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,910
Now say good night.

322
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,474
Dad, do we have to?

323
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,314
No, you two can stay up.
We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin'
each other how much we love each other.

324
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,476
Right, honey?

325
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,431
Good night.

326
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,755
So, what did the emperor want?

327
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,711
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

328
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,195
- Couldn't see you? Why not?
- I don't know.

329
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,676
- Well... Well, that's just rude.
- Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.

330
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,793
- No, no, no, no. No. Emperor or no
emperor, it's called common courtesy.
- Honey...

331
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,629
If that were me, I'd march right back
there and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

332
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,638
- Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.
- Pacha, I'm fine.

333
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,513
This baby's not coming
for a while, but even if it was...

334
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,437
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

335
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,109
That kind of behavior just-just...

336
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,117
I gotta go wash something.

337
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,194
Pacha? You okay?

338
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,790
Hmm? Oh, yeah. I'm just
a little tired from the trip.

339
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,037
Um, I'm gonna go
put Misty away.

340
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,670
Hi. Excuse me.
Two seconds here.

341
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,631
Um, I'm the one
in the cart. Remember?

342
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,070
This story's about me,
not him.

343
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,079
Okay. You got it? All right. We're gonna
move ahead. Sorry to slow you down.

344
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,557
Huh?

345
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,839
Whoa.

346
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,953
- Where'd you come from, little guy?
- No touchy.

347
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,799
- Demon llama!
- Demon llama? Where?

348
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,795
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

349
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,559
Ow! Ow, my head.

350
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,399
Okay, demon llama.
Just take it easy.

351
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,159
I mean you no harm.

352
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,114
What are you talking about...
Oh, wait, I know you.

353
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,313
- You're that whiny peasant.
- Emperor Kuzco?

354
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,237
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

355
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,351
Uh, how did...

356
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,436
You don't look like the emperor.

357
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,518
What do you mean I don't
look like the emperor?

358
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,760
- Do this...
- What is this, some kind of little
game you country folk like to...

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,950
It can't be!

360
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,638
My face!
My beautiful, beautiful face!

361
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,955
- Okay, okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm an ugly, stinky llama!

362
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,833
- Wait, okay, Your Majesty. Shh.
- Llama face!

363
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,269
What happened?

364
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,834
I'm tryin' to
figure that out, okay?

365
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,718
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.

366
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,559
Wait a minute.
I remember you.

367
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,035
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool...

368
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,754
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

369
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,679
- And you turned me into a llama!
- What? No, I did not.

370
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,439
- Yes, and then you kidnapped me.
- Why would I kidnap a llama?

371
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,632
I have no idea. You're
the criminal mastermind, not me.

372
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,672
- What?
- You're right.

373
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,677
That's giving you
way too much credit.

374
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,995
Okay. I have to get back
to the palace.

375
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,317
Yzma's got that "secret lab."

376
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,829
I'll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

377
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,032
Hey, you.
No time to waste. Let's go.

378
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,637
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this
body. Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

379
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,879
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,195
You wanna run that
by me again?

381
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,157
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind...

382
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,714
and build your summer home
somewhere else.

383
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,434
I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

384
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,358
I don't make deals
with peasants!

385
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,994
Then I guess I can't
take you back.

386
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,192
Fine. I don't need you.
I can find my own way back.

387
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,756
I wouldn't recommend it. It's a little
dangerous if you don't know the way.

388
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,189
- Nice try, pal.
- No, really. I'm telling you...

389
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,914
there are jaguars and snakes
and quicksand.

390
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,431
- I'm not listening.
- I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.

391
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,916
Ow! Still not listening.

392
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,955
Aw, you...
Fine. Fine. Go ahead.

393
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,390
If there's no Kuzco,
there's no Kuzcotopia.

394
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,317
Takes care of my problem.

395
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,954
Scary jungle. Right.
Oh, a leaf.

396
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,993
Oh, it might attack me.
Oh, it's a scary tree.

397
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,759
I'm afraid.

398
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,031
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such...

399
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,199
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

400
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,629
Okay, where am I?

401
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,950
Help me!
Help me! Help me!

402
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,838
- Too late.
- Okay, that was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

403
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,873
What do you want?

404
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,719
Oh, for me?
Why, I don't know what to say.

405
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,710
- Ow!
- Hit the road, bucky.

406
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,432
Ow! Huh? Huh?

407
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,398
Huh? Uh-oh.

408
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,071
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

409
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,668
No, no. No, don't.

410
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,269
Ha!

411
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,995
No!

412
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,468
You killer jaguars...

413
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,672
Whoa!

414
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,193
Don't worry, Your Highness.
I got ya. You're safe now.

415
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,038
Maybe I'm just new to this whole
rescuing thing, but this, to me...

416
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,515
might be considered kind of
a step backwards, wouldn't you say?

417
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,997
No, no, no. It's-It's okay. This-This
is all right. We can figure this out.

418
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,079
- I hate you.
- No!

419
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,157
Ow! Ow!

420
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,628
Ow! Ow!

421
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,116
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting all funned out.

422
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,276
- Uh-oh.
- Don't tell me.

423
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,470
- We're about to go over
a huge waterfall.
- Yep.

424
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,239
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?
- Most likely.

425
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,271
Bring it on.

426
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,999
Your Highness.
Your Highness, can you hear me?

427
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,190
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.

428
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,671
Breathe!

429
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,950
Oh. Why me?

430
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,560
All right.

431
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,759
For the last time,
it was not a kiss.

432
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,158
Well, whatever you call it,
it was disgusting.

433
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,748
And if you would've done what I ordered
you to do in the first place...

434
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,237
we all could've been spared
your little kiss of life.

435
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,678
But now that you're here,
you will take me back to the palace.

436
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,759
I'll have Yzma change me back, and then
I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia.

437
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,678
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, now look...

438
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,075
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

439
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,596
I just think if you really
thought about it...

440
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,109
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

441
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,310
And why would I do that?

442
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,431
Because...

443
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,472
deep down, I think you'll realize
that you're forcing an entire village...

444
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,397
out of their homes
just for you.

445
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,990
And that's bad?

446
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,429
Well, yeah.

447
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,790
Uh, nobody's that heartless.

448
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,629
- Now take me back.
- What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

449
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,150
All you care about
is building your summer home and
filling it with stuff for you.

450
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,955
Uh, yeah. Doy. Me.
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

451
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,755
You're the only one that doesn't seem
to be with the programme, eh, Pacha?

452
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,872
You know what? Someday,
you're gonna wind up all alone...

453
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,753
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

454
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,792
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.
Now, for the final time...

455
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,673
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

456
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,756
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here...

457
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,919
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

458
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,398
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

459
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,592
Me, me, me.

460
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,871
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything. I didn't...

461
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,992
Somebody's throwing stuff. You gonna
build a fire or what? What's going on?

462
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,916
He's never gonna
change his mind.

463
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,748
How am I ever gonna
get out of here?

464
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,874
And so, it is with
great sadness...

465
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,515
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

466
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,796
taken from us so tragically...

467
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,639
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

468
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,116
- Poor little guy.
- His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

469
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,119
- He never had a chance.
- for all eternity.

470
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,350
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

471
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,357
Back to work.

472
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,599
Kronk, darlin',
I must admit you had me worried...

473
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,676
when you mixed up those poisons.

474
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,679
But now that Kuzco is dead,
all is forgiven.

475
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,634
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's... He's dead, all right.

476
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,355
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he... than he is right now.

477
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,552
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

478
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,432
I suppose.

479
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,951
- Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.
- Kronk.

480
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,355
- I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.
- Kronk.

481
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,870
I wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist.

482
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,753
Kuzco is dead, right?

483
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,396
Tell me Kuzco's dead.
I need to hear these words.

484
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,513
- Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?
- He's still alive?

485
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,870
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

486
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,755
- Kronk.
- I just thought I'd give you the
heads-up in case Kuzco ever came back.

487
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,589
- He can't come back!
- Yeah. That would be kind of awkward...

488
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,517
especially after
that lovely eulogy.

489
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,950
You think? You and I
are going out to find him.

490
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,833
If he talks, we are through!
Now let's move.

491
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,476
Dad, look out!

492
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,670
Tipo, what is it?

493
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,315
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log
and was careening out of control...

494
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,396
down a raging river of death!

495
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,476
- All right, all right, it's okay. Shh.
- It was awful!

496
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,196
It's okay, it's okay. Tipo, calm down.
It was just a dream. Your dad's fine.

497
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,517
He just went back
to see the emperor.

498
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,030
Oh. Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

499
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,118
That's right. Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

500
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,037
Yeah, like that
would ever happen.

501
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,913
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

502
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,076
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-uh.
- Nuh-uh.

503
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,599
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

504
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,631
- Good night, you two.
- Yeah-huh. Night, Mom.
- Nuh-uh. Night, Mom.

505
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,432
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

506
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,952
Uh, hey.

507
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,672
- Thanks.
- Oh.

508
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,631
No problem.

509
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,234
- Feels like wool.
- Yeah.

510
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,954
- Alpaca?
- Oh, yeah, it is.

511
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,868
Oh, yeah, I thought so.
It's nice.

512
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,673
- My wife made it.
- Oh, she knits?

513
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,475
- Crochets.
- Crochets? Nice.

514
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,238
Thanks.

515
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,237
So...

516
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,753
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city, we'd, uh...

517
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,715
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know, I-I might...

518
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,152
Are you saying
you've changed your mind?

519
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,352
- Oh, well, I-I...
- Because you know that means...

520
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,153
you're doing something nice
for someone else.

521
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,909
- No, I know that. I know.
- And you're all right with that?

522
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,837
Yes.

523
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,837
What?

524
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,070
Don't shake unless you mean it.

525
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,478
All right.

526
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,955
Let's get you
back to the palace.

527
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,514
Oh, by the way, thanks.

528
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,076
No, thank you.

529
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,232
Okay. Once we cross this bridge,
it's only an hour to the palace.

530
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,796
- Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.
- I believe it.

531
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,036
- What was that?
- Nothing.

532
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,318
Whoa! Kuzco!

533
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,831
- Kuzco!
- Yeah?

534
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,679
Quick, help me up!

535
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,837
- No. I don't think I will.
- You're gonna leave me here?

536
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,589
Well, I was gonna have
you imprisoned for life,
but I kind of like this better.

537
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,711
I thought you were
a changed man.

538
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,434
Oh, come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

539
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,314
- So all of it was a lie?
- Well, yeah. No, wait.

540
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,631
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie. Toodles.

541
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,637
We shook hands on it!

542
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,678
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is you need hands.

543
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,598
Okay. Buh-bye.

544
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,153
- Are you okay? Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm all right.

545
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,716
Good! That's for going back
on your promise!

546
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,991
Yeah. That's for
kidnapping me...

547
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,272
and taking me to your village, which
I'm still gonna destroy, by the way.

548
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,038
No touchy.

549
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,913
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

550
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,510
I was always taught that
there was some good in everyone,
but, oh, you proved me wrong.

551
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,712
Oh, boo-hoo.
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

552
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,877
I could've let you die out there
in that jungle, and then
all my problems would be over.

553
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,150
Well, that makes you
ugly and stupid.

554
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,510
- Let's end this.
- Ladies first.

555
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,235
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

556
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,192
What are we gonna do?

557
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,118
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

558
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,629
That's it for me!

559
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,591
No, we're not.
Calm down.

560
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,757
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.

561
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,677
Okay, now the other one.

562
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,071
When I say go, push against my back
and we'll walk up the hill.

563
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,395
Ready? Go.

564
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,514
- Ow! You did that on purpose.
- No, I didn't!

565
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,916
Now, we're gonna have to work together
to get out of this, so follow my lead.

566
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,794
- Ready? Right foot.
- Whose right? Your right or-or mine?

567
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,036
- I don't care. Mine.
- Well, why yours?

568
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,151
- Okay, your right! Ready?
- Okay, got it.

569
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,077
Okay. Right.

570
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,193
- Left. Right.
- Look, we're moving!

571
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,800
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me. Stay with me.

572
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,276
Right. Left.
Right. Left.

573
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,154
Right. Left. Right!

574
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,558
- Now what, genius?
- Working on it.

575
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,750
Okay, here's the deal.

576
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,872
Stretch out your neck,
and I'll grab the rope.

577
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,514
How do I know you won't let me fall
after you grab the rope?

578
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,473
You're just gonna
have to trust me!

579
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,192
You know, it's a good thing
you're not a big, fat guy...

580
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,117
or this would be
really difficult.

581
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,755
Almost. Got it!

582
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,839
- It's stuck.
- Take your time. No hurry here.

583
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,589
- Scorpions!
- Kuzco!

584
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,150
Oh, no!

585
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,433
Huh?

586
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,678
Whoa!

587
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,552
Huh?

588
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,477
Look out!

589
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,315
Yeah! Oh, look at me
and my bad self.

590
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,034
I snatched you
right out of the air.

591
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,277
"Oh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall,
and I'm taking you with me."

592
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,675
Well, not today, pal.
Uh-huh.

593
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,916
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

594
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,235
- You just saved my life.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

595
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,511
Huh? So?

596
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,074
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
- That there is some good
in you after all.

597
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,316
- Oh, no.
- Admit it.
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

598
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,398
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.
- Nuh-uh.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.

599
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,832
Come on. What's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless!

600
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,316
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.

601
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,749
Right. Sure.

602
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,711
Well, we better get going.

603
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,991
With that bridge out, it's
a four-day walk to the palace.

604
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,429
What? You mean you're still
taking me back?

605
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,395
- I shook on it, didn't I?
- Well, yeah, uh, but I hope you
realize that doesn't change a thing.

606
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,273
I'm still building Kuzcotopia
when I get back.

607
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,756
Well, four days is a long time. Who
knows? Maybe you'll change your mind.

608
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,155
Uh-huh. Four days.

609
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,397
- What are the chances
of you carrying me?
- Not good.

610
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,670
No, no, no!

611
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,995
We've searched every village
surrounding the palace...

612
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,997
and still no sign of Kuzco.

613
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,395
Where is he?

614
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,192
- Kronk!
- Kronk here.

615
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,392
- I'm getting tired. Pull over.
- Sure thing. Kronk out.

616
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,794
Perfect.
These are my best shoes.

617
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,596
I hate this jungle.

618
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,792
Oh, look. A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

619
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,480
Just one more
for exotic bird bingo.

620
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,397
I am loving this.

621
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,080
Get away from me!

622
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,398
Yeah. Tell me about it.

623
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,910
No, no, it's not you. She's not
the easiest person to get close to.

624
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,429
There's a wall there.
Trust me.

625
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,471
Are you talking
to that squirrel?

626
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,556
I was a junior chipmunk, uh...

627
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,069
and I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

628
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,476
Please continue.

629
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,519
Why me? Why me?

630
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,756
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

631
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,632
This poor little guy
has had it rough.

632
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,718
Seems a talking llama
gave him a hard time the other day.

633
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,638
Oh, a talking llama?

634
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,557
Do tell.

635
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,070
Uh, he doesn't really
wanna talk to you.

636
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,191
Well, then you ask him.

637
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,629
I hate being in the middle.
Squeaky, uh...

638
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,990
squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.

639
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,276
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.

640
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,837
Uh, could you give us
a little room here?

641
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,076
Uh, sorry.

642
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,595
A little bit more, please.

643
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,712
- How's this?
- Yeah, that's good.

644
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,310
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

645
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,750
Uh, squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.

646
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,633
- Low blood sugar, huh?
- Yeah. It's a curse.

647
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,797
Well, as soon as we get something to
eat, you're walking the rest of the way.

648
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,071
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut...

649
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,910
home of the mug of meat.

650
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,031
What'll it be?

651
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,311
We'll have two specials.
Is that all right, dear?

652
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,910
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

653
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,238
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Bless you for coming out in public.

654
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,316
So that's two specials.

655
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,512
And an onion log.
To split.

656
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,116
Ordering!
I need two heartburns...

657
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,277
and a deep-fried doorstop
on table 12!

658
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,796
Okay, so I'll admit
this was a good idea.

659
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,832
When will you learn that
all my ideas are good ones?

660
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,952
That's funny, because I thought that
you going into the jungle by yourself...

661
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,835
being chased by jaguars, lying to me
to take you back to the palace
were all really bad ideas.

662
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,679
Oh, yeah. Anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude.

663
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,191
Hot and crispy pillbug
for the happy couple.

664
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,157
Oh, boy.

665
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,950
Oh, here.
Let me get that for you.

666
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,910
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna slip into the kitchen
and have a word with the chef.

667
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,600
- You're gonna get us thrown out.
- Please.

668
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,917
With this disguise,
I'm invisible.

669
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,240
We've been walking around in circles
for who knows how long.

670
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,114
That is the last time we take
directions from a squirrel.

671
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,277
I should have done away
with Kuzco myself when I had the chance.

672
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,513
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

673
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,390
Uh-oh. I'll get you
another one there, Yzma.

674
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,353
- You using that fork, pal?
- Hey, don't I know you?

675
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,074
- I don't think so.
- Wrestled you in high school?

676
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,997
- Don't remember that.
- No? Metal shop?
- Uh, no...

677
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,554
Oh, I got it. Miss Narca's
interpretive dance... two semesters.

678
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,389
I was usually in the back because
of my weak ankles. Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

679
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,637
Uh, no, look, I-I don't think
we've ever met, but, look, I gotta go.

680
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,116
- Don't worry. I'll think of it.
- Look, all I know is
the food looked iffy.

681
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,356
All right? And I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

682
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,040
- Psst! Hey!
- So I'm just checking to make sure...

683
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,957
that you're gonna take
the main course up a notch.

684
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,675
Is there anything on this menu
that is not swimming in gravy?

685
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,075
- Hang on. I'll go ask the chef.
- It's a simple question.

686
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,113
Is there or is there not
anything edible on this menu?

687
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,959
Hey, I didn't ask him
about dessert yet!

688
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,310
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

689
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,237
All right, buster,
that's it!

690
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,669
You want a special order,
then you make it! I quit!

691
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,429
- Yeah, but I... Hold on.
- You know, I try and I try, but there's
just no respect for anyone with vision.

692
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,950
- That-That's it! There's just
nothing I can do about it!
- Wait a second. Please don't go.
- Ordering.

693
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,709
- Three pork combos, extra bacon on
the side, two chili cheese samplers...
- No, no.

694
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,274
a basket of liver and onion rings,
a catch of the day...

695
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,278
and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

696
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,960
- You got all that, honey?
- Three oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air...

697
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,913
basket of Grandma's breakfast
and change the bull to a gill, got it.

698
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,828
- What's going on?
- There's no time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

699
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,916
What is he doing in there?

700
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,631
- Come on!
- In a minute. I'm still hungry.

701
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,228
- No, Kuzco!
- Okay, I'll make it simple for you.

702
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,954
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast. You got it?

703
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,436
- Can do.
- What's taking so long?

704
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,676
- Pickup!
- Kronk, what are you doing?

705
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,711
- Kind of busy here.
- Why am I not surprised?

706
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,638
Yo! Order's up!

707
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,833
Oh, well, while you're at it, make me
the special. And hold the gravy!

708
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,270
- Check. Pickup!
- You know what? On second thought,
make my omelet a meat pie.

709
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,278
- Meat pie. Check.
- Kronk!

710
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,359
- Can I order the potatoes
as a side dish?
- I'll have to charge you full price.

711
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,711
- Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?
- You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

712
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,434
- Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.
- Cheddar spuds coming up.

713
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,358
- Spuds yes, cheese no.
- Hold the cheese.
- No, I want the cheese.
- Cheese it is.

714
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,631
- Cheese me no "likee."
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!
- Come on. Make up your mind!

715
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,354
- Okay, okay, on second thought,
make my potatoes a salad.
- Make my potatoes a salad.

716
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,871
Excuse me. You see
that woman over there?

717
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,195
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

718
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,636
<i>One, two, three, four</i>
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>from all of us to you</i>

719
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,115
<i>We wish it was our birthday</i>
<i>so we could party too</i>

720
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,549
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>May all your dreams come true</i>

721
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,513
<i>- We wish it was our birthday</i>
<i>so we could party too</i>
- It's your birthday?

722
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,677
- What are you doing?
- Look, there's two people in there
looking for you.

723
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,791
- What?
- A big guy and a skinny old woman.

724
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,115
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

725
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,674
- Oh, yeah.
- That's Yzma and Kronk. I'm saved!

726
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,031
- Trust me, they're not here to save you.
- They'll take me back to the palace.

727
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,833
Thanks for your help. You've been great.
I can take it from here.

728
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,315
No, no, you don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

729
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,477
- Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.
- No, I can't let you!

730
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,354
What? Wha...
Oh! Oh, I get it.

731
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,436
- What?
- You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

732
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,552
- You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.
- No!

733
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,513
- This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.
- Will you just listen to me...

734
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,633
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is
your-your stupid hilltop!

735
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,672
- What?
- You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here. Go!

736
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,553
- But-But...
- Go on! Get out of here!

737
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,955
Fine!

738
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,390
- Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
- What'd I do?

739
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,149
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!

740
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,512
There'll be no more diversions until
we track that llama down and kill him!

741
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,713
Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go,
not even on your birthday.

742
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,070
Kuzco must be eliminated.

743
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,839
The empire will finally be rid
of that useless slug.

744
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,670
Well, you got a point. Nobody really
seems to care that he's gone, do they?

745
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,877
Pacha!

746
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,995
Pacha?

747
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,151
So this is where you came in.

748
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,158
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here.

749
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,919
I didn't do anything, and they ruined
my life and took everything I had.

750
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,999
- Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?
- What? I'm just telling them
what happened.

751
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,715
Who you kidding, pal? They saw the
whole thing. They know what happened.

752
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,958
- Well, yeah, but... but...
- Just leave me alone.

753
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,875
The peasant at the diner!

754
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,271
He didn't pay his check.

755
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,154
He's the peasant who I saw leaving
the city who disappeared into the crowd
with Kuzco on the back of his cart.

756
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,794
He must have taken him back to his
village, so if we find the village,
we find him...

757
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,639
and if we find him, we find Kuzco.

758
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,194
Oh, yeah,
it's all comin' together.

759
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,472
- Yzma!
- What?

760
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,910
This had better be good!

761
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,756
So there we were standing on the cliff,
and the ground started to rumble.

762
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,270
And just as it started to go,
he grabbed me before I fell.

763
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,072
Do you believe that?

764
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,078
You know, call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here...

765
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,954
but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him.

766
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,958
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

767
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,116
He's a lousy llama.

768
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,471
I mean,
a really lousy llama.

769
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,475
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know...

770
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,875
what I said to you
back at the diner, that-that...

771
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,797
I-I didn't really...

772
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,388
So, you tired of being a llama?

773
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,957
Yes!

774
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,833
Okay, we're just gonna stop at
the house and get some supplies.

775
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,552
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

776
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,592
Hey there, Pacha. Hey, you know,
you just missed your relatives.

777
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,518
- My relatives?
- Yeah. We just sent 'em
up to your house.

778
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,200
- What did they look like?
- Well, you see,
there was this big guy...

779
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,788
and this older woman who was, uh...

780
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,480
- How would you describe her?
- Scary beyond all reason.

781
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,874
Yeah, that's it.

782
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,948
So remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

783
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,550
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great aunt.

784
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,480
Twice removed.

785
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,068
- Uh-huh.
- Isn't that right, Kronk?

786
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,589
<i>Ninety-nine monkeys</i>
<i>jumpin' on the bed</i>

787
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,439
<i>One fell off</i>
<i>and bumped his head</i>

788
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,472
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way...

789
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,435
but as I said to you before,
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

790
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,711
- I'll be sure and tell him you came by.
- Oh, would you, please?

791
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,115
That would be just great.

792
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,515
Oops. Silly me.

793
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,835
No, no. Allow me.

794
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,279
She's hiding something. When I give
the word, we search the house.

795
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,914
Okay, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

796
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,319
- So while we're waiting for Paca...
- Pacha.

797
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,237
Yeah, I...
Oh, yes.

798
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,193
Um, perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

799
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,392
You know, why don't you just
come back when Pacha gets home?

800
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,592
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

801
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,392
Uh, excuse me, won't you?

802
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,239
I think I left something
in the oven.

803
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,909
This is my variation of double Dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

804
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,871
- Kronk, it's time!
- Okay.

805
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,110
So we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab and change him back.

806
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,719
Hi there!

807
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,354
- Um, that was him.
- Whoops.

808
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,516
You know what? I don't believe
you're really my great aunt.

809
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,596
You're more like
my great-great-great...

810
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,314
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

811
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,831
- Thanks, honey.
- You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

812
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,554
great-great-great-great-great...

813
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,355
- All right! Are you through?
- great-great aunt.

814
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,789
- So, where were we?
- Listen, sister,
we're not leaving until...

815
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,275
I show you the house.
Of course.

816
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,834
Hey, was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

817
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,838
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

818
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,077
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

819
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,079
- There is no handle in here.
- There's not? Are you sure?

820
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,270
All right,
I've had enough of this.

821
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,312
Tell us where the talking llama is,
and we'll burn your house to the ground.

822
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,954
Uh, don't you mean "or"?

823
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,516
Tell us where the talking llama is,
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

824
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,189
Well, which is it? That seems
like a pretty crucial conjunction.

825
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,550
That's it, Kronk!
Break the door down!

826
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,638
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

827
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,309
I don't care, you fool. Get out of
my way. I'll break it down myself.

828
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,318
- A-one!
- Okay, kids, you know what to do.

829
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,237
- Two!
- Right, Mom!

830
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,828
Three!

831
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,828
Okay, children,
on your mark...

832
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,155
get set, go!

833
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,231
Stop it, you little brats!
Huh?

834
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,275
Ow! Oh, there they go, Kronk!
And... They're getting away!

835
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,311
Well, I had a great time.
Let's not wait...

836
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,829
until the next family reunion
to get together.

837
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,157
- Kronk!
- I, uh... I gotta run.

838
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,189
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

839
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,310
<i>Please remain seated and keep your arms</i>
<i>and legs in at all times.</i>

840
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,037
Huh?

841
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,751
- What does it look like?
- I don't know. Just keep looking.

842
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,950
Over here!
It has to be one of these.

843
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,514
Lions, tigers, bears...

844
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,198
Oh, my.

845
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,117
Looking for this?

846
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,631
No! It can't be! How did you
get back here before us?

847
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,070
Uh... How did we, Kronk?

848
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,829
Well, ya got me. By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

849
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,076
Oh, well, back to business.

850
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,998
Okay, I admit it. Maybe I wasn't
as nice as I should have been.

851
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,793
But, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

852
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,878
Just think of it
as you're being let go...

853
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,195
that your life's going
in a different direction...

854
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,630
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

855
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,877
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

856
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,355
I know.
It's called a cruel irony...

857
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,596
like my dependence on you.

858
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,429
- I can't believe this is happening!
- Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

859
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,516
No!

860
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,790
- Aha!
- Oh, okay.

861
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,792
Finish them off.

862
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,912
Hey, you're not backing down now,
are you, big guy?

863
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,917
Uh, where's the other guy?

864
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,272
- Yo!
- Sorry I'm late. So what'd I miss?

865
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,154
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and
asked me to, you know, take them out.

866
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,193
And then this guy popped up and then
we waited for you, and quite honestly...

867
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,914
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

868
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,918
This one simple thing.
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

869
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,953
- Whoa now!
- A really, really
big stupid monkey named Kronk!

870
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,196
- Ouch.
- And do you want
to know something else?

871
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,914
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

872
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,837
Never!

873
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,916
- That's it. She's going down.
- Now, now, remember, guys.

874
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,918
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

875
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,037
That'll work.

876
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,756
- Strange. That usually works.
- And so does this!

877
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,758
Ah. Should have seen
that coming. Whoa!

878
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,349
Give me that vial!

879
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,276
Oops. Clumsy me.

880
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,636
Which one? Which one?

881
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,759
Better hurry.
I'm expecting company.

882
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,556
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!

883
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,319
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... Kuzco!

884
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,954
- They're not listening to me!
- Just take 'em all.

885
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,312
- Get them!
- Hey, I've been turned into a cow.

886
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,716
- Can I go home?
- You're excused. Anyone else?

887
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,479
- No, we're good.
- Yeah, we're-we're good.
- Get them!

888
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,068
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

889
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,437
Uh, Pacha?
Little help!

890
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,355
Come on! Come on!

891
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,869
Oh, please be
something with wings.

892
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,038
Yeah! We're flyin'!
Uh-oh.

893
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,954
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.
I'm picking the next one.

894
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,753
- Fine by me!
- Give me that one.

895
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,877
Don't you say a word.

896
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,678
Quick!
Drain the canals!

897
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,597
Open up!

898
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,473
Yea! I'm a llama again!

899
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,397
Wait.

900
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,669
- There they go! After them!
- Come on, men!

901
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,836
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

902
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,437
Okay, only two left.
It's gotta be one of these.

903
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,717
No!

904
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,077
I'll take that.

905
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,714
This is the one.
This'll change you back to a human.

906
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,035
Ow! Hey, get her off!

907
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,913
Ow! Get her off me!

908
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,756
- Drink the potion!
- Okay, okay!

909
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,919
- Where did it go? Where is it?
- Looking for this?

910
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,919
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?

911
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,315
- Oh, well.
- No, no! Don't drop it!

912
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,749
I'm not going to drop it,
you fool!

913
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,711
I'm going to drink it!

914
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,513
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self...

915
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,995
I'm going to kill you!

916
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,034
Oh! Uh-oh.

917
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,153
- Kuzco!
- Be right there! Give me a minute!

918
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,115
Kuzco! Whoa!

919
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,997
Kuzco!

920
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,158
The vial!

921
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,235
For the last time,
we did not order a giant trampoline.

922
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,158
You know, pal, you could have
told me that before I set it up.

923
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,478
The vial!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

924
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,116
- I win.
- Whoa.

925
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,598
Got it!

926
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,473
What are the odds of
that trap door leadin' me out here?

927
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,229
Here, uh, let me
get this for you.

928
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,433
Well, see ya
on the other side.

929
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,552
Oh, now, you-you-you stop
being so hard on yourself.

930
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,477
- All is forgiven.
- You're sure?

931
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,673
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,
and it won't be the last.

932
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,677
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.

933
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,597
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.
Oh, hey!

934
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,678
I gotta use that arm later.
Okay, buddy, take care.

935
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,197
He's a sweet guy.

936
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,315
So, you lied to me.

937
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,831
- I did?
- Yeah. You said...

938
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,236
when the sun hits this ridge
just right, these hills sing.

939
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,351
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills...

940
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,552
and I did not hear any singing.

941
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,476
So I'll be building my summer home
on a more magical hill.

942
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,670
Thank you.

943
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,597
Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

944
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,756
No, no, I'm sharp.
I'm on it.

945
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,872
Looks like you and your family are stuck
on the tuneless hilltop forever, pal.

946
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,549
You know, I'm pretty sure I heard
some singing on the hill next to us.

947
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,477
In case you're interested.

948
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,955
- Ha! Boom, baby!
- Ha! Boom, baby!

949
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,394
<i>You'd be the coolest dude</i>
<i>in the nation</i>

950
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,511
<i>Or the hippest cat in creation</i>

951
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,473
<i>But if you ain't got friends</i>
<i>then nothing's worth the fuss</i>

952
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,992
<i>A perfect world will come to be</i>

953
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,111
<i>When everybody here can see</i>

954
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,515
<i>That a perfect world begins and ends</i>

955
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,676
<i>A perfect world begins and ends</i>

956
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,360
<i>A perfect world</i>
<i>begins and ends with us</i>

957
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,316
- "My acorn is missing."
- Squeak, squeakin', squeak, squeakity.

958
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,955
- "Did you eat the acorn?"
- Squeaker, squeak, squeak, squeakin'?

959
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,392
- "You owe me a new acorn."
- Squeak, squeak, squeak,
squeak, squeaker...

960
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,431
- Squeakin'.
- I'm so proud of you guys.

961
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,519
<i>In the quiet time of evening</i>

962
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,513
<i>When the stars assume their patterns</i>

963
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,029
<i>And the day has made his journey</i>

964
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:41,597
<i>And we wondered just what happened</i>

965
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,359
<i>To the life we knew</i>

966
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,472
<i>Before the world changed</i>

967
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,273
<i>When not a thing I had</i>

968
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,231
<i>Was true</i>

969
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,673
<i>But you were kind to me</i>

970
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,872
<i>And you reminded me</i>

971
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,754
<i>That the world</i>
<i>is not my playground</i>

972
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,634
<i>There are other things that matter</i>

973
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,831
<i>And what is simple needs protecting</i>

974
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,872
<i>Or my illusions all would shatter</i>

975
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,798
<i>But you stayed</i>

976
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,549
<i>In my corner</i>

977
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,514
<i>The only world I know</i>
<i>was upside-down</i>

978
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,073
<i>And now the world and me</i>

979
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,509
<i>We know you carry me</i>

980
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:47,192
<i>You see the patterns</i>
<i>in the big sky</i>

981
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,917
<i>Those constellations look</i>
<i>like you and I</i>

982
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:58,637
<i>Just like the patterns</i>
<i>in the big sky</i>

983
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:03,675
<i>We could be lost</i>
<i>we could refuse to try</i>

984
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,598
<i>But we made it through</i>

985
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,156
<i>In the dark night</i>

986
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,989
<i>Who would those lucky guys</i>
<i>turn out to be</i>

987
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,473
<i>But that unusual blend</i>

988
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,388
<i>Of my funny friend and me</i>

989
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,317
<i>I'm not as clever as I thought I was</i>

990
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,953
<i>I'm not the boy</i>
<i>I used to be because</i>

991
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,911
<i>You show me somethin' different</i>

992
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,510
<i>You show me somethin' pure</i>

993
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,475
<i>I always seemed so certain</i>
<i>but I was really never sure</i>

994
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,239
<i>But you stayed</i>

995
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,909
<i>And you called my name</i>

996
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,589
<i>When others would have walked out</i>
<i>on a lousy game</i>

997
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,953
<i>And look who made it through</i>

998
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,150
<i>But your funny friend and me</i>

999
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:13,150
<i>- You see the patterns in the big sky</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1000
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:18,434
<i>Those constellations look</i>
<i>like you and I</i>

1001
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,998
<i>That tiny planet</i>
<i>and the bigger guy</i>

1002
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:29,797
<i>I don't know whether</i>
<i>I should laugh or cry</i>

1003
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,119
<i>- Just like the patterns in the big sky</i>
<i>- We'll be together</i>

1004
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,789
<i>We'll be together</i>
<i>till the end this time</i>

1005
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,797
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>you don't know</i>

1006
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:46,313

1007
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,992
<i>We'll stick together</i>

1008

1009
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,390
