00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,330
Ooh, Your Highness.

168
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,330
Ahem.

169
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,790
Oh, oh, oh,
ha ha ha. Um...

170
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,340
Uh, you were
doing it again.

171
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,260
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?

172
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,510
Doing my job.

173
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,510
I'm the emperor,

174
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,090
and you're the emperor's
advisor.

175
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,090
Remember that?

176
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,340
But, Your Highness,

177
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,060
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

178
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,060
Kuzco: Whoa

179
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,930
Look at these wrinkles

180
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,980
What is holding
this woman together?

181
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,690
What the--

182
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,520
How long
has that been there?

183
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,070
Kronk:
Good thinkin', Yzma

184
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,070
What do you say,
Kuzco?

185
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,570
Whoa! No touchy!

186
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,780
No touchy.
No touch.

187
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,870
Servant: Excuse me,
Your Highness

188
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,410
The village leader
is here to see you.

189
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,030
Oh, great.
Send him in.

190
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,580
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired.

191
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,830
Fired?

192
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,370
W-W-What do you mean,
fired?

193
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,580
Um, how else
can I say it?

194
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,080
You're being let go,

195
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,630
your department's
being downsized,

196
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,170
you're part of
an outplacement,

197
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,420
we're going in a
different direction,

198
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,470
we're not picking
up your option...

199
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,130
Take your pick.
I got more.

200
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,340
But l-- You--uh--

201

Uhh.

202
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,100
But--
But, Your Highness,

203
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,810
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

204
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,900
for--for--for
many, many years.

205
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,520
Hey, hey, everybody
hits their stride.

206
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,440
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

207
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,490
So...who's
in my chair?

208
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,490
Kronk:
Oh, oh! I know!

209
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,490
Yzma.

210
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,950
Yzma's in your
chair, right?

211
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,740
Very good, Kronk.

212
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,910
Here. Get the snack.

213
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,580
Got it!

214
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,950
Unh! Oof!.

215
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,960
Ok, you heard
the man.

216
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,960
Up, up, up.

217
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,210
Kronk: I’m ok
I'm fine

218
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,630
[Snarling]

219
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,090
Ah.

220
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,470
ok. Show him in.

221
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,590
Ahem.

222
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,300
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.

223
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,140
I'm here because
I received a summons--

224
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,140
Kuzco: Hey,
there he is!

225
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,060
My main village man.

226
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,560
Um, Pacha.

227
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Anyway, I got
this summons--

228
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,980
Pacha.

229
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,440
That's right.

230
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,230
You are just the man
I wanted to see.

231
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,570
I am?

232
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,900
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

233
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,320
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

234
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,580
Sure.
I'll do what I can.

235
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,200
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

236
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,000
Are you aware of
just how important

237
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,420
your village is
to the empire?

238
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,290
Well, I know
we grow the crops

239
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,670
that you use here
at the palace.

240
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,590
We also herd the llamas
that you--

241
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,300
My village?

242
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,390
Oh, yeah.

243
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,550
You got a pretty sweet
little setup there

244
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,140
on top of that hill,
don't you? Ha ha ha!

245
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,640
Yeah. My family has
lived on that hilltop

246
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,940
for the last
6 generations.

247
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,270
Uh-huh.

248
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,810
So tell me,

249
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,110
where do you find
you get the most sun?

250
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,360
Oh, I'd say

251
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,570
just on the other side
of those trees.

252
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,820
When the sun hits
that ridge just right,

253
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,120
these hills sing.

254
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,450
Well, that settles it.

255
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,490
Really?

256
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,750
Yep. Problem solved.

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,960
Thanks for coming.

That's it?

That's all
you wanted me for?

260
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,590
I just needed
an insider's opinion

261
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,170
before I ok'd this spot
for my pool.

262
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,630
Uh...your pool?

um...l don't understand
how this could happen.

Well, let me
clear it up for you.

At my birthday
celebration tomorrow,

will be destroyed

" Number one..."

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,710
Look at that guy!

497
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,830
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

498
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
We've been
through this.

499
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,090
It's a harp,
and you know it.

500
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,960
Oh, right.
That's a harp...

501
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,010
and that's a dress.

502
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,260
Robe!

503
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,180
Reason number 2.

504
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,510
Look what
I can do.

505
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,680
Ha ha ha!

506
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,810
But... what does that
have to do with anything?

507
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,890
No, no.
He's got a point.

508
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,390
Listen, you guys.

509
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,270
You're sort of confusing me,
so be gone!

510
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,860
Uh, or, uh, you know.

511
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,480
However I get rid
of you guys.

512
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,400
That'll work.

Kuzco: Um, what's with
the chimp and the bug?

514
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,300
Can we get back tome?

515
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

516

What to do, what to do?

517
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,850
What do we do
with the body?

What am I gonna
tell the village?

Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

This is not good.

Uhh. Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

I think I'm still growing!

All right, Tipo.

Stand still
and let's see.

Mom, you and I
both know

that it's
impossible for him

to have grown in
the last 5 minutes.

Mmm! Mmm!

Isn't it?

[Gasps] Look how much
you've grown!

What? Tipo, get
out of the way.

It's my turn again.
Measure me.

Dad! I ate
a bug today!

Oh! Was Mom
baking again?

Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.

Look at
how big I am!

We were all
measured today.

Oh.

560
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,660
I'm going through
a growth spurt.

561
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm as big
as you were

Mm-hmm. Sure are.

That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

Ok, ok, you two.

566
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,380
Our deal was that
you could stay awake

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,590
until Daddy came home.

568
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,630

do we have to?

No, you two can stay up.

We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

So what did
the emperor want?

580
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,990
Ahem.

581
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,070
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

582
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Couldn't see you?

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,620
- Why not?
- I don't know.

Well, that's
just rude.

585
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,450
Well, he is
the emperor.

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,450
I'm sure he's busy.

No, no, no, no. No.

588
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,080
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

If that were me,
I'd march right back there

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,540
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

Sweetie, sweetie,
think of the baby.

for a while,

but even if it was,

I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

597

That kind of behavior
just--just--

in the cart. Remember?

construction

827
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,820
on Kuzcotopia.

828
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,820
Oh, yeah.

829
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,860
Ok, now, look,

830
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,360
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

831
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,700
Mm-hmm.

832
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,030
I just think if you really
thought about it,

833
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,200
you'd decide
to build your home

834
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,660
on a different hilltop.

835
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,750
And why would I
do that?

836
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,130
Because...

837
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,710
deep down,
I think you'll realize

838
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,340
that you're forcing
an entire village

839
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,210
out of their homes
just for you.

840
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,090
And that's...

841
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,090
bad?

842
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,640
[Laughs]
Well, yeah.

843
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,100
Nobody's
that heartless.

844
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,140
Mmm.

845
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,430
Now take me back.

846
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,480
What?
Wait, wait.

847
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,190
How can you
be this way?

848
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,020
All you care about
is building your summer home

849
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,860
and filling it
with stuff for you.

850
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,480
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.

851
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,780
Everyone else
in the kingdom gets it.

852
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,030
You're the only one
that doesn't seem to be

853
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,360
with the program,

854
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,780
eh, Pacha?

855
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,870
You know what?

856
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,990
Someday, you're going
to wind up all alone,

857
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,000
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

858
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,710
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.

859
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,210
Now, for the final time,

860
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,170
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

861
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,380
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here,

862

you change your mind,

Moo, moo, moo.

Huh? What?

868
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,150
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--

869
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,400
Somebody's
throwing stuff.

or what? What's going on?

He's never going
to change his mind.

Ohh. How am I ever going
to get out of here?

it is
with great sadness

878
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,150
that we mourn
the sudden departure

of our beloved prince...

on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

883

Poor little guy.

His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

885
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,040
He never had
a chance.

886
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,920
for all eternity.

Yzma:
Kronk, darlin',

892
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,310
I must admit
you had me worried

893
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,480
when you mixed up
those poisons,

894
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,150
but now that
Kuzco is dead,

895
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,690
all is forgiven.

896
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,450
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...

897

Heh. He's dead,
all right. Heh heh.

898
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,080
I mean, you can't get
much deader than he--

than he is right now.

Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

He's still alive?

ever came back.

Yeah. That would be
kind of awkward--

out of control

Who knows? Maybe
you'll change your mind.

1154
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,440
Uh-huh.

What are the chances
of you carrying me?

00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,610
Not good.

surrounding the palace

and still
no sign of Kuzco.

00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,790
Where is he?

These are my best shoes.

Aah!

There's a wall there.
Trust me.

Are you talking
to that squirrel?

1190

I was a junior chipmunk.

all the woodland creatures.

and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

Ok, I'll make it simple
for you.

I'll have to charge you
full price.

Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,640
You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

1352
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,190
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.

Cheddar spuds
coming up.

the cheese

- Cheese in!

it was our birthday

A big guy
and a skinny old woman.

scary beyond all reason?

You've been great.

I can take it from here.

They're trying to kill you.

and get some supplies.

1472
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,450
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

1473
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,580
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1474
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,620
My relatives?

1475
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,040
We just sent them
up to your house.

1476
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,830
What did
they look like?

1477
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,830
See, there was
this big guy

1478
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,250
and this older woman
who was...

1479
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,340
How would
you describe her?

1480
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,920
Scary beyond all reason.

1481
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,380
Yeah, that's it.

1482
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,680
So, remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

1483
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,470
Why, I'm his
third cousin's brother's

1484
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,890
wife's step-niece's
great-aunt. Heh heh.

1485
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,140
Twice removed. [Sips]

1486
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,270
Uh-huh.

1487
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,270
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1488
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,730
99 monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

1489
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,820
One fell off
and bumped his head

1490
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,650
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way,

1491
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,450
but as I said to you before,

1492
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,330
you may recall,
Pacha is not here.

1493
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:55,910
I'll be sure and tell him
you came by.

1494
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1495
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,630
Oops. Silly me.

1496
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,050
No, no. Allow me.

1497
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,430
She's hiding something.

1498
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,930
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1499
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,720
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

1500
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,310
Grr!

1501
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:19,600
So, while we're
waiting for Paca--

1502
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,270
Pacha.

1503
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,770
Oh, yes.

1504
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,270
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1505
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,280
You know, why don't
you just come back

1506
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,820
when Pacha gets home?

1507
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,950
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

1508
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,950
[Stammers]
Excuse me, won't you?

1509
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:36,790
I think I left
something in the oven.

1510
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:38,790
This is my variation
of double-dutch.

1511
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:40,250
On the signal,
we switch places.

1512
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,670
Kronk, it's time!

1513
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:42,670
ok!

1514
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,460
Ohh!

1515
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,380
So, we have to get
back to the palace,

1516
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,960
find the lab,
and change him back.

1517
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,010
Hi there!

1518
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,010
Aah!

1519
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:52,510
- That was him.
- Whoops.

1520
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,470
You know what?

1521
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,720
I don't believe you're
really my great-aunt.

1522
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,020
You're more like
my great-great-great...

1523
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,810
Go. I'll stall them
long enough

1524
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:02,890
for you two to get
a head start.

1525
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,400
Thanks, honey.

1526
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,400
You have a lovely wife.

1527
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,650
They're both very pretty.

1528
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,860
Great-great-
great...

1529
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,490
Grr! All right!

1530
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,360
Are you through?

1531
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,360
...great-great-aunt.

1532
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,410
So, where were we?

1533
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:16,870
Listen, sister, we're
not leaving until--

1534
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,830
I show you the house.
Of course.

1535
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,330
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1536
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,080
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1537
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,090
What do you mean,
the door is stuck?

1538
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,800
Try jiggling the handle.

1539
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,550
There is no handle
in here.

1540
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,880
There's not?
Are you sure?

1541
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,890
All right, I've had
enough of this.

1542
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,930
Tell us where
the talking llama is

1543
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,510
and we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1544
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,220
Uh,
don't you mean "or"?

1545
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,730
[Sighs] Tell us where
the talking llama is

1546
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,810
or we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1547
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,310
Well, which is it?

1548
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,690
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1549
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,940
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!

1550
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,940
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?

1551
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:54,360
This is hand-carved
mahogany.

1552
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,780
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.

1553
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,200
I'll break it down myself.

1554
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,580
Yzma: A-one

1555
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,040
Ok, kids,
you know what to do.

1556
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,040
2

1557
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,410
Right, Mom!

1558
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,540
3!

1559
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,170
Aah!

1560
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,640
Ok, children,
on your mark,

1561
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,890
get set, go!

1562
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,430
[Giggling]

1563
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,230
Ow! Ow! Stop it,
you little brats! Huh?

1564
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,730
Yzma: Ow!

1565
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:31,480
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1566
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,740
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.

1567
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,740
Let's not wait until
the next family reunion

1568
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,030
to get together.

1569
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,200
Yzma: Kronk!

1570
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,790
I, uh, I gotta run.

1571
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,600
[Thunder]

1572
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,770
[Thunder]

1573
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,310
Ok, why does she even
have that lever?

1574
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,820
[Yelps]

1575
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,990
Skull:
Please remain seated

1576
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,990
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

1577
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,620
Aah!

1578
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Huh?

1579
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,830
What does it look like?

1580
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,330
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

1581
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,670
Over here!

1582
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:14,800
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1583
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,710
Yzma: Oh, my

1584
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,340
Looking for this?

1585
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,510
No! It can't be!

1586
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,510
How did you get
back here before us?

1587
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,100
Uh...how did we, Kronk?

1588
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,600
Well, you got me.

1589
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,520
By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

1590
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,810
Oh, well,
back to business.

1591
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,320
Ok, I admit it.

1592
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,480
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1593
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:40,320
but, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

1594
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,870
Just think of it
as you're being let go,

1595
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,950
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1596
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:49,540
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1597
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,540
Hey, that's kind of like
what he said to you

1598
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:52,790
when you got fired.

1599
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,790
I know. It's called
a cruel irony--

1600
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,800
like my dependence
on you.

1601
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,460
I can't believe
this is happening!

1602
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,800
Then I bet you weren't
expecting this

1603
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,260
- No!
- Aah!

1604
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,850
Aha!

1605
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,390
[Sighs]
Oh, ok.

1606
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:08,520
Ha ha!
Finish them off.

1607
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,890
Kronk devil: Hey, you're
not backing down now,

1608
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,810
are you, big guy?

1609
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,980
Uh, where's the other guy?

1610
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:18,980
Yo!

1611
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,610
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?

1612
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,280
Well, Yzma just
tossed me this knife

1613
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,700
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1614
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,620
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1615
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,700
and quite honestly--

1616
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:32,580
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1617
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,080
This one simple thing.

1618
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,580
It's like I'm talking
to a monkey.

1619
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,750
Whoa now.

1620
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,880
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1621
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:40,920
Ouch.

1622
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,510
And do you want
to know something else?

1623
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,090
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

1624
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,640
Never!

1625
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,850
[Sobs]

1626
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,680
That's it.
She's going down.

1627
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,680
Now, now,
remember, guys.

1628
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,480
From above, the wicked shall

1792
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,610
Sting: In the quiet time
of evening

1793
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:29,910
When the stars
assume their patterns

1794
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:35,670
And the day
has made his journey

1795
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,460
And we wondered
just what happened

1796
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:45,340
To the life we knew

1797
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:48,260
Before the world
changed

1798
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:51,560
When not a thing I had

1799
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,850
Was true

1800
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,850
Was true

1801
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:59,230
But you were kind to me

1802
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,230
And you reminded me

1803
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,820
That the world
is not my playground

1804
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,870
There are other things
that matter

1805
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:18,750
And what is simple
needs protecting

1806
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:25,380
Or my illusions
all would shatter

1807
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:27,300
But you stayed

1808
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:32,260
In my corner

1809
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:36,690
The only world I know
was upside-down

1810
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,230
And now
the world and me

1811
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,820
We know you carry me

1812
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:50,870
You see the patterns
in the big sky

1813
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:56,790
Those constellations
look like you and I

1814
01:13:56,910 --> 01:14:02,630
Just like the patterns
in the big sky

1815
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:07,970
We could be lost,
we could refuse to try

1816
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,970
But we made it through

1817
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:14,560
In the dark night
