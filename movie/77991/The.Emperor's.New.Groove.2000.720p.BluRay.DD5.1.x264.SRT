1
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,227
Aah!

2
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:34,255
Wee-be-be-bee.

3
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,981
Will you take a look at that?

4
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,514
Pretty pathetic, huh?

5
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:38,972
Well, you'll never
believe this,

6
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:40,238
but that llama
you're looking at

7
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:41,964
was once a human being

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,575
And not just
any human being

9
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:44,956
That guy was an emperor

10
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:46,989
A rich, powerful ball
of charisma

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,026
Oh, yeah!

12
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,517
This is his story

13
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,355
Well, actually my story

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,156
That's right--
I'm that llama

15
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,380
The name is Kuzco

16
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,683
Emperor Kuzco

17
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:02,561
I was the world's
nicest guy,

18
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,170
and they ruined my life
for no reason

19
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:05,859
Oh, is that hard to believe?

20
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,623
Look, I tell you what
You go back away--

21
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,694
you know, before
I was a llama,

22
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,075
and this will all make sense

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,913
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,755
Oh, ho! Look at me!

25
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,173
That's me as a baby

26
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,014
Waah!

27
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,466
Ahem! All right,
let' smove ahead

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,106
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,102
Theme song guy: There are
despots and dictators

30
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:45,210
Political manipulators

31
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:49,582
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

32
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,654
There are kings
and catty tyrants

33
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,492
Who are so lacking
in refinements

34
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:56,524
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

35
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:00,129
He was born and raised
to rule

36
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,392
No one has ever been
as cool

37
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:05,423
In a thousand years
of aristocracy

38
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:09,143
An enigma and a mystery

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,253
In Mesoamerican history

40
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:14,436
The quintessence of
perfection that is he

41
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,350
Ok, this is the real me

42
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:18,310
Not this

43
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,576
- This
- Not this.

44
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,072
- Winner!
- Loser.

45
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,181
Ok, see this palace?

46
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:24,676
Everyone in it
is at my command

47
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:25,674
Check this out

48
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:27,899
Butler.

49
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,930
Chef.

50
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,273
Theme song guy.

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,694
Oh, yeah!

52
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,993
He's the sovereign lord
of the nation

53
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,371
He's the hippest cat
in creation

54
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:40,057
He's the alpha,
the omega, A to Z

55
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:43,279
And this perfect world
will spin

56
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,426
Around his every
little whim

57
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:48,304
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

58
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,262
Me.

59
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,336
What's his name?

60
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:54,056
Kuzco

61
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,245
That's his name

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,894
Kuzco

63
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,194
He's the king
of the world

64
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:01,190
Kuzco

65
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,878
Is he hip or what?

66
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,718
Kuzco

67
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:06,328
Yeah

68
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,819
Gow!

69
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,545
You threw off my groove!

70
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,502
I'm sorry,
but you've thrown off

71
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,764
the emperor's groove.

72
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,644
Sorry!

73
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,407
You were saying?

74
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:25,775
What's his name?
Kuzco

75
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:28,806
Kuzco

76
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:31,336
That's his name

77
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,478
Is he hip or what?

78
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:39,735
Don't you know he's
the king of the world?

79
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,070
Whoa, yeah

80
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:45,298
Oww!

81
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,326
Ha!

82
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,286
Boom, baby!

83
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,935
Aah! Your Highness,

84
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,623
it is time for you
to choose your bride.

85
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,042
Allrighty

86
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,497
Trot out
the ladies

87
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,533
Let's take a look-see.

88
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,948
Hate your hair.
Not likely.

89
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,019
Yikes, yikes, yikes,

90
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:03,515
and let me guess.

91
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:05,586
You have
a great personality.

92
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:07,466
Is this really
the best you could do?

93
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:09,728
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I mean, perhaps--

94
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:11,455
What
is he babbling about?

95
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,793
He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up

96
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,515
Anyway, still wondering about
that llama in the opening?

97
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,579
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life

98
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,569
First, there's Pacha

99
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:26,527
Uh, excuse me.

100
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,138
I'm here to see
Emperor Kuzco.

101
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:29,749
You see,
I got this summons--

102
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,514
Inside, up the stairs,
and to the left

103
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,240
Just follow the signs

104
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,116
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.

105
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,028
Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look

106
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:41,523
Oh!

107
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,480
Pardon me
That's mine

108
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,477
Oh, here you go.

109
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:45,896
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

110
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,581
Aah! Oh, hey.
Are you all right?

111
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:49,539
Here. Let me, uh--

112
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:50,422
Oh, you're
so very kind.

113
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,381
What happened?

114
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:52,341
Well, I...

115
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:54,333
I threw off
the emperor's groove.

116
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,485
- What?
- His groove!

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,942
The rhythm in which
he lives his life,

118
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,207
his pattern of behavior.

119
00:04:58,322 --> 00:04:59,281
I threw it off,

120
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,698
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

121
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,808
Oh, really?

122
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:04,959
I'm supposed
to see him today.

123
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:06,263
Don't throw off
his groove!

124
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:07,298
Oh, ok.

125
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,985
Beware the groove.

126
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,366
Hey, are you
gonna be all right?

127
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,938
Groove.

128
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,627
Kuzco: You see
what I mean?

129
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:16,427
This guy's trouble,
but as bad as he is,

130
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:18,535
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next

131
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:19,917
And why have you
come here today?

132
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:21,604
Well

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,557
Your Highness--
I mean, Your Grace.

134
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,935
Ok, gang
Check out this piece of work

135
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:29,889
This is Yzma,
the emperor's advisor--

136
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,842
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth

137
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,220
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man

138
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:37,138
Every decade or so
she gets a new one

139
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,863
This year's model
is called Kronk

140
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:42,891
Yeah, I got
that there, Yzma.

141
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,499
Unh!

142
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:47,378
Yep, that's Kronk

143
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:50,370
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

144
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,670
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

145
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,666
and I’m thinkin'
that's got to stop

146
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,736
It is no concern
of mine

147
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:57,773
whether your family
has...

148
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,884
What was it again?

149
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,457
Um, food.

150
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:02,605
Ha! You really should
have thought of that

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,406
before you
became peasants.

152
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:05,558
We're through here.

153
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,514
Take him away. Next!

154
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,163
But l--

155
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:10,698
Oh, ok.

156
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,073
Ugh.

157
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,067
The nerve of some
of those peasants, huh?

158
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,330
Tell me about it.
Aah!

159
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,365
Hi there.

160
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,784
Ooh, Your Highness.

161
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:21,742
Ahem.

162
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,121
Oh, oh, oh,
ha ha ha. Um...

163
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:25,617
Uh, you were
doing it again.

164
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,416
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?

165
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:29,606
Doing my job.

166
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:30,565
I'm the emperor,

167
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,061
and you're the emperor's
advisor.

168
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:33,019
Remember that?

169
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:34,246
But, Your Highness,

170
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,855
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

171
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:37,814
Whoa

172
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,537
Look at these wrinkles

173
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,490
What is holding
this woman together?

174
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,101
What the--

175
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:46,866
How long
has that been there?

176
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,361
Good thinkin', Yzma

177
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:49,319
What do you say,
Kuzco?

178
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:50,739
Whoa! No touchy!

179
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,887
No touchy.
No touch.

180
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:53,922
Excuse me,
Your Highness

181
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,380
The village leader
is here to see you.

182
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,952
Oh, great.
Send him in.

183
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:58,448
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired.

184
00:06:58,524 --> 00:06:59,638
Fired?

185
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,053
W-W-What do you mean,
fired?

186
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,243
Um, how else
can I say it?

187
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:04,663
You're being let go,

188
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,157
your department's
being downsized,

189
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:07,616
you're part of
an outplacement,

190
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:08,841
we're going in a
different direction,

191
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:09,839
we're not picking
up your option...

192
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,411
Take your pick.
I got more.

193
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,559
But l-- You--uh--

194
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:14,864
Uhh.

195
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,165
But--
But, Your Highness,

196
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:19,736
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

197
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:22,726
for--for--for
many, many years.

198
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,219
Hey, hey, everybody
hits their stride.

199
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,020
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

200
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,934
So...who's
in my chair?

201
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:31,893
Oh, oh! I know!

202
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:32,853
Yzma.

203
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,272
Yzma's in your
chair, right?

204
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,996
Very good, Kronk.

205
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,109
Here. Get the snack.

206
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,719
Got it!

207
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,024
Unh! Oof!.

208
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:40,983
Ok, you heard
the man.

209
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,942
Up, up, up.

210
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,089
I’m ok
I'm fine

211
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:46,852
Ah.

212
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:50,111
ok. Show him in.

213
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,102
Ahem.

214
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,752
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.

215
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,515
I'm here because
I received a summons--

216
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,476
Hey,
there he is!

217
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,316
My main village man.

218
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:00,735
Um, Pacha.

219
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:02,576
Anyway, I got
this summons--

220
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,033
Pacha.

221
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,414
That's right.

222
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,140
You are just the man
I wanted to see.

223
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:08,406
I am?

224
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,669
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

225
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,889
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

226
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,074
Sure.
I'll do what I can.

227
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:19,567
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

228
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:21,293
Are you aware of
just how important

229
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:22,674
your village is
to the empire?

230
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,438
Well, I know
we grow the crops

231
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,781
that you use here
at the palace.

232
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,621
We also herd the llamas
that you--

233
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,147
My village?

234
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,182
Oh, yeah.

235
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,254
You got a pretty sweet
little setup there

236
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,747
on top of that hill,
don't you? Ha ha ha!

237
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:40,125
Yeah. My family has
lived on that hilltop

238
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,351
for the last
6 generations.

239
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,615
Uh-huh.

240
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,072
So tell me,

241
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:47,297
where do you find
you get the most sun?

242
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:48,485
Oh, I'd say

243
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,555
just on the other side
of those trees.

244
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,740
When the sun hits
that ridge just right,

245
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,927
these hills sing.

246
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,192
Well, that settles it.

247
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,189
Really?

248
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,417
Yep. Problem solved.

249
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:00,567
Thanks for coming.

250
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:01,565
That's it?

251
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,022
That's all
you wanted me for?

252
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:05,017
I just needed
an insider's opinion

253
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:07,472
before I ok'd this spot
for my pool.

254
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,849
Uh...your pool?

255
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:10,807
Boo-yah!

256
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,419
Welcome to
Kuzcotopia,

257
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,030
my ultimate
summer getaway

258
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,832
complete
with water slide.

259
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:17,367
What?

260
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:18,364
Isn't it great?

261
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,435
It's my birthday gift
to me. Ha!

262
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,161
I'm so happy.

263
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,156
Uh...uh...

264
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,993
um...l don't understand
how this could happen.

265
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,681
Well, let me
clear it up for you.

266
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,713
At my birthday
celebration tomorrow,

267
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:31,673
I give the word,

268
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,284
and your town
will be destroyed

269
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,546
to make way for this...

270
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,067
So, if I were you,

271
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,332
I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

272
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,330
on the way home.

273
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,478
But, um,
where will we live?

274
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:48,281
Hmm...

275
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,393
Don't know,
don't care.

276
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:50,351
How's that?

277
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,038
Oh, but wait.
You can't--

278
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,332
When I give the word,

279
00:09:57,408 --> 00:10:01,244
your little town thingy
will be bye-bye.

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,472
Bye-bye!

281
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:04,006
Oh, w--wait. No--

282
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,692
Heh heh. Boohoo.

283
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,877
Oh, yeah
Everything was goin' my way

284
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:11,753
Or so I thought

285
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,709
He can't get rid of me
that easily.

286
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:17,698
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

287
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:18,656
Does he...

288
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,191
A little to the left.

289
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,835
...have any idea of
who he's dealing with?

290
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,061
How could he
do this to me?

291
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,785
Why, I practically
raised him.

292
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,665
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

293
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,543
Yeah, go figure.

294
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,536
Well, it's better you're
takin' out your anger

295
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:35,456
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco, huh?

296
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:37,796
That's it, Kronk!

297
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:38,755
- That's it!

298
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:41,593
I'll get rid of Kuzco.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

299
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,395
The real Kuzco?

300
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,772
Of course
the real Kuzco.

301
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,575
Don't you see?
It's perfect.

302
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,991
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

303
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:53,175
I'll take over
and rule the empire.

304
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,480
Brilliant!

305
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:55,975
So how does that work

306
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,586
with you bein' fired
and all?

307
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,078
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

308
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,842
soon to be the two of us.

309
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:03,838
And I'm one of
those two, right?

310
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:04,912
To the secret lab!

311
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,515
Pull the lever, Kronk.

312
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:10,588
Wrong lever!

313
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:12,505
Huh?

314
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,190
Why do we even
have that lever?

315
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,335
Get out of my way!

316
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:21,826
Please remain seated

317
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,322
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

318
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:24,397
Whee!

319
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,581
Faster, faster!

320
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:29,113
Yzma, put your hands
in the air!

321
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,454
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

322
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:37,782
Ah, how shall I do it?

323
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,621
Oh, I know.

324
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,386
I'll turn him
into a flea,

325
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,226
a harmless little flea,

326
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,030
and then I'll
put that flea in a box,

327
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,024
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,

328
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,789
and then I'll
mail that box to myself,

329
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:49,863
and when it arrives,

330
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:50,974
Ah ha ha ha!

331
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,698
I'll smash it
with a hammer!

332
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:56,076
It's brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant, I tell you!

333
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:57,035
Genius, I say!

334
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,555
Or, to save on postage,

335
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,742
I'll just poison him
with this.

336
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,122
Take it, Kronk.

337
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:09,538
Oh ho ho ho.
Feel the power.

338
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:10,496
Oh...

339
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,609
I can feel it.

340
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:13,720
Our moment of
triumph approaches.

341
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:15,368
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

342
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,363
It's dinner time.

343
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,215
So...is everything
ready for tonight?

344
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,441
Oh, yeah. I thought
we'd start off

345
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:31,669
with soup
and a light salad

346
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,163
and then see how
we feel after that.

347
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,388
Not the dinner...

348
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,501
The you know.

349
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:38,803
Oh, right.
The poison--

350
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,183
The poison for Kuzco,

351
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,485
the poison chosen
specially to kill Kuzco,

352
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,597
Kuzco's poison.

353
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:45,629
That poison?

354
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:46,588
Yes! That poison.

355
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,700
Got you covered.

356
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:48,966
Excellent.

357
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,999
A few drops in his drink,

358
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:52,379
then I'll propose a toast,

359
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,069
and he will be dead
before dessert.

360
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,487
Which is a real shame,

361
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:56,599
because it's gonna
be delicious.

362
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:58,632
Boom, bam, baby!

363
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,051
Let's
get to the grub

364
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:02,927
I am one hungry
king of the world.

365
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:07,108
So...no hard feelings
about being let go?

366
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:09,294
None whatsoever.

367
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,742
Kronk, get
the emperor a drink.

368
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:16,850
Drink. Right.

369
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,035
Your Highness.

370
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,528
Is something burning?

371
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:37,140
My spinach puffs!

372
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:43,660
Ahem.

373
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,459
So... he seems...

374
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,494
nice.

375
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,335
Heh. He is.

376
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,747
He's what,
in his late twenties?

377
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:56,546
Heh heh. I'm not sure.

378
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:57,812
Saved 'em!

379
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:58,771
- That's great.
- Yzma: Great!

380
00:13:58,924 --> 00:13:59,882
- Good job.
- Very good job.

381
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:01,801
Watch it.
They're still hot.

382
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,450
Ahem.

383
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:04,640
Ahem!

384
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,598
Heh heh heh.

385
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,247
Kronk.
The emperor

386
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,433
needs his...
drink.

387
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,693
Right. Oh. Right.

388
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,898
Hey, Kronky,
everything ok back there?

389
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,394
Well, heh.

390
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,159
Oh, uh...

391
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,651
Ooh. The drinks
were a bit on the...

392
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:28,803
hmm...

393
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,640
oh...ugh...warm side.

394
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:32,867
Heh heh.

395
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:34,900
Hey, did you see
that sky today?

396
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:35,859
Talk about blue.

397
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,278
Ha ha ha.
Yes, Kronk.

398
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:39,005
Riveting.

399
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,728
A toast to
the emperor!

400
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:43,875
Long live Kuzco!

401
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,254
Don't drink the wine.

402
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:47,366
Poison.

403
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,612
Ah! Tasty.

404
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:58,757
Finally!
Ha ha ha!

405
00:14:58,872 --> 00:14:59,984
Good work,
Kronk.

406
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,173
Oh, they're
so easy to make.

407
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,132
I'll get you
the recipe.

408
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,279
Now to get rid
of the body.

409
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,233
Ok! What were we saying?

410
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,532
Uh...we were
just making a toast

411
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,682
Yzma:
to your long and

412
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,173
healthy rule

413
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:18,087
Right. So what
are you gonna do?

414
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,427
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

415
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,304
and I really mean
a long time. Um...

416
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,454
Ahem.

417
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,681
It might
be difficult

418
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,522
for someone of your age

419
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:29,248
adjusting to life
in the private sector.

420
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,204
Hey, Kronk, can you
top me off, pal?

421
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:32,737
Be a friend? Heh heh.

422
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,308
Now, about you
finding new work

423
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,919
Hit him on the head.

424
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:38,108
that's--that's
gonna be tough

425
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,259
More broccoli?

426
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,138
Because you're
you know

427
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:42,940
Let's face it
You're no spring chicken,

428
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:45,088
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

429
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,154
What? A llama?

430
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,187
He's supposed
to be dead!

431
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:52,913
Yeah, weird.

432
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,173
Let me see that vial.

433
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:00,315
This isn't poison.

434
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,458
This is extract
of llama. Ugh!

435
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:05,570
You know,
in my defense,

436
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:06,912
your poisons
all look alike.

437
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:07,872
You might
think about

438
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,098
re labeling
some of them.

439
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:13,509
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

440
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:14,467
What about dinner?

441
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:17,536
Kronk, this is
kind of important.

442
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:19,300
How about dessert?

443
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:22,906
Well, I suppose
there's time for dessert.

444
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:24,440
And coffee?

445
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,472
All right.
A quick cup of coffee.

446
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:29,425
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

447
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:35,984
Cha cha
cha cha

448
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,249
Guess where I am
right now

449
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,321
Uh-huh. In the bag

450
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:41,162
Still think I'm
not the victim here?

451
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,926
Watch. It gets better.

452
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,113
Hey! Ba-da ba-da
ba-da-da

453
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,605
Ugh, he's doing
his own theme music?

454
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:55,468
Ba-da
ba-da ba-da ba

455
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,656
Ba-da-ba

456
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,342
Gig, dumb,
and tone deaf

457
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,950
I am so glad I was
unconscious for all of this

458
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:02,910
Huhh!

459
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,166
Mission accomplished.

460
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,094
You're not
just gonna let him

461
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,012
die like that,
are you?

462
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,278
My shoulder angel.

463
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,233
Don't
listen to that guy

464
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,346
He's trying
to lead you

465
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,073
down the path
of righteousness.

466
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

467
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:30,984
Oh, come off it.

468
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,095
You come off it!

469
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,055
- You.
- You.

470
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,359
- You.
- You infinity.

471
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:35,319
Uhh!

472
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:37,619
Listen up, big guy.

473
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,997
I got 3 good reasons why
you should just walk away.

474
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:40,957
" Number one..."

475
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:41,953
Look at that guy!

476
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,987
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

477
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,136
We've been
through this.

478
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,092
It's a harp,
and you know it.

479
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,895
Oh, right.
That's a harp...

480
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,892
and that's a dress.

481
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,120
Robe!

482
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,961
Reason number 2.

483
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,226
Look what
I can do.

484
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:55,340
Ha ha ha!

485
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,372
But... what does that
have to do with anything?

486
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:59,366
No, no.
He's got a point.

487
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,823
Listen, you guys.

488
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:03,586
You're sort of confusing me,
so be gone!

489
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,120
Uh, or, uh, you know.

490
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,653
However I get rid
of you guys.

491
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,494
That'll work.

492
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,433
Um, what's with
the chimp and the bug?

493
00:18:30,548 --> 00:18:32,390
Can we get back tome?

494
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,493
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

495
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:37,683
What to do, what to do?

496
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:38,640
What do we do
with the body?

497
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,580
What am I gonna
tell the village?

498
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:50,109
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.

499
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,336
What do I
do? What do I do?

500
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,371
- Aah!

501
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,509
Back!
Elbow! Shoulder!

502
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,004
- Unh!

503
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:08,135
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

504
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,208
Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.

505
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:11,702
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

506
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,119
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!

507
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,074
Uh-oh

508
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,263
This is not good.

509
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,331
Uhh. Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

510
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:12,302
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

511
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,758
Measure me again!

512
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:15,369
Ha!
All right, Tipo.

513
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,597
Stand still
and let's see.

514
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,131
Mom, you and I
both know

515
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:19,396
that it's
impossible for him

516
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:20,586
to have grown in
the last 5 minutes.

517
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,121
Mmm! Mmm!

518
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:23,462
Isn't it?

519
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,498
Look how much
you've grown!

520
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,297
What? Tipo, get
out of the way.

521
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,100
It's my turn again.
Measure me.

522
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,864
Dad's home!

523
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:34,507
Hey, ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

524
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:36,312
Come here
Ha ha ha!

525
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,453
Dad! I ate
a bug today!

526
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:42,026
Oh! Was Mom
baking again?

527
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,521
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.

528
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:44,711
I heard that.

529
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,666
Ok, everybody,
move aside

530
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:49,159
Lady with a baby
comin' through.

531
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:50,426
Dad, Dad, Dad!

532
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,959
Look at
how big I am!

533
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:53,111
We were all
measured today.

534
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:54,068
Oh.

535
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:55,602
I'm going through
a growth spurt.

536
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:56,985
I'm as big
as you were

537
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,943
when you were me.

538
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,477
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

539
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:02,239
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

540
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:05,308
Ok, ok, you two.

541
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:06,841
Our deal was that
you could stay awake

542
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:07,991
until Daddy came home.

543
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:09,947
Now say good night.

544
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,134
Dad,
do we have to?

545
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,196
No, you two can stay up.

546
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,652
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

547
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,069
how much we love each other.

548
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,106
Right, honey?

549
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:24,176
- Ew!
- Blecch!

550
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,136
Good night.

551
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:28,511
So what did
the emperor want?

552
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:29,470
Ahem.

553
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,465
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

554
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,501
Couldn't see you?

555
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:33,920
- Why not?
- I don't know.

556
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,261
Well, that's
just rude.

557
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:36,603
Well, he is
the emperor.

558
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:37,562
I'm sure he's busy.

559
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:38,752
No, no, no, no. No.

560
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:41,052
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

561
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,089
Honey...

562
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,622
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

563
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,348
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

564
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:46,806
Sweetie, sweetie,
think of the baby.

565
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,340
Pacha, I'm fine.

566
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:49,874
This baby's not coming
for a while,

567
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,216
but even if it was,

568
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,058
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

569
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:54,861
That kind of behavior
just--just--

570
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:56,817
Uhh!

571
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,350
I gotta go
wash something.

572
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:14,345
Pacha?

573
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:15,418
You ok?

574
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,799
Hmm?

575
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,060
Oh, yeah. I'm just
a little tired from the trip.

576
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:22,744
Um...I’m gonna go
put Misty away.

577
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:36,436
Uh, heh heh. Hi.
Excuse me.

578
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:37,395
2 seconds here.

579
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,351
Um, I'm the one
in the cart. Remember?

580
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:41,921
This story's about me,
not him.

581
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,145
ok. You got it?
All right.

582
00:22:44,223 --> 00:22:45,602
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

583
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,093
Heh heh heh.

584
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:57,569
Huh?

585
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:01,059
Whoa.

586
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:03,974
Uhh. Oh.

587
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:05,279
Where'd you come from,
little guy?

588
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,656
No touchy.

589
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:08,959
Aah! Demon llama!

590
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:10,494
Demon llama? Where?

591
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:11,952
- Aah!
- Aah!

592
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:16,477
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ooh hoo hoo!

593
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:19,240
Ow! Ow, my head.

594
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:20,198
Ok, demon llama.

595
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:22,078
Just take it easy.

596
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,877
I mean you no harm.

597
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:26,488
What are you
talking about--

598
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,788
Oh, wait. I know you.

599
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:30,093
You're that whiny
peasant.

600
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:32,932
Emperor Kuzco?

601
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,888
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

602
00:23:35,003 --> 00:23:37,073
Uh...how did--

603
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,723
Um...

604
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:40,104
you don't...

605
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,099
look like
the emperor.

606
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:43,823
What do you mean I don't
look like the emperor?

607
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,243
Uh...oh...

608
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,702
do this...

609
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:48,503
What is this,
some kind of little game

610
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:49,768
you country folk like to--

611
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:51,649
Aah! It can't be! Aah!

612
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:54,219
Aah! Aah!

613
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:57,324
My face! Aah! My beautiful,
beautiful face!

614
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,284
Ok, ok, ok.

615
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm an ugly,
stinky llama!

616
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:01,160
Wait, ok,
Your Majesty.

617
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,389
- Llama face!
- Shh!

618
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:04,535
What happened?

619
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,952
I'm tryin' to
figure that out, ok?

620
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,326
Ohh-ho!

621
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:11,631
I can't remember.

622
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:13,204
I can't remember
anything.

623
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,546
Wait a minute.

624
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,272
I remember you.

625
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:17,537
I remember
telling you

626
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:18,725
that I was
building my pool

627
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:19,763
where
your house was,

628
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,411
and then you
got mad at me.

629
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,061
Ohh!

630
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:25,093
And you turned me
into a llama!

631
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,357
What? No, I did not.

632
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:28,699
Yes, and then
you kidnapped me.

633
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,117
Why would I
kidnap a llama?

634
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:31,422
I have no idea.

635
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:33,301
You're the criminal
mastermind, not me.

636
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,452
What?

637
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:36,369
Hmm. You're right.

638
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:38,401
That's giving you
way too much credit.

639
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,666
ok. I have to get back
to the palace.

640
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:43,465
Yzma's got
that "secret lab."

641
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,267
I'll just
snap my fingers

642
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:46,494
and order her
to change me back.

643
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,604
Hey, you.
No time to waste.

644
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:49,717
Let's go.

645
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:54,895
Hey, tiny, I want
to get out of this body.

646
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,353
Wouldn't you?
Now let's go.

647
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:01,530
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

648
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:03,869
You want to run that
by me again?

649
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,244
I can't let you go back

650
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:08,819
unless you change
your mind

651
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:12,383
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

652
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:14,531
Hmm. I got
a little secret for you.

653
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,102
Come here.
No, closer.

654
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:19,364
I don't make deals
with peasants!

655
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,663
Then I guess I can't
take you back.

656
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,312
Fine.
I don't need you.

657
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:25,846
I can find
my own way back.

658
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:27,073
I wouldn't recommend it.

659
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:29,414
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

660
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,487
Nice try, pal.

661
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:31,868
No, really.
I'm telling you,

662
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,632
There are
jaguars and snakes

663
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:34,591
and quicksand

664
00:25:34,706 --> 00:25:35,549
I'm not listening.

665
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:36,509
I'm not kidding.

666
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:38,387
Listen, you cannot
go in there.

667
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:39,347
La la la la

668
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:42,606
Oh. Heh heh.
Still not listening.

669
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:44,065
Aw, you...

670
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:45,867
Fine. Fine.

671
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:47,593
Go ahead!

672
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,242
If there's no Kuzco,

673
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,045
there's no Kuzcotopia.

674
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,498
Takes care
of my problem.

675
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:00,518
Hmm.

676
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:08,994
Scary jungle.
Right.

677
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,025
Ooh, a leaf.
Ooh, it might attack me.

678
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,674
Oh, it's a scary tree.

679
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:16,436
I'm afraid. Ha ha.

680
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:18,891
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor,

681
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:19,925
and as such,

682
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:23,876
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

683
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:25,372
Ok, where am I?

684
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:30,089
Wha--

685
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:32,006
Help me!
Help me!

686
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,618
Help me!

687
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,265
Uhh.

688
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,874
Too late.

689
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,522
Ok, that was the freakiest
thing I've ever seen.

690
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,502
Aah!

691
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,573
Hmm.
What do you want?

692
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:53,024
Oh, for me?

693
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:54,406
Why, I don't know
what to say.

694
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:57,283
Ow!

695
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:58,356
Hit the road, bucky.

696
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,726
Aah! Ow!

697
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,106
Huh?

698
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,065
Huh?

699
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:09,020
Huh?

700
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:11,052
Uh-oh.

701
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,755
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

702
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,750
No, no.
No, don't.

703
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:29,577
Ha!

704
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,028
Aah!

705
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:35,713
No!

706
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:43,423
Aah!

707
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:47,871
Aah!

708
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:57,114
You killer jaguars...

709
00:27:57,229 --> 00:27:58,764
Whoa!

710
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:06,091
Aah-eee!

711
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,121
Aah!

712
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,141
Aah!

713
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,671
Yee-aah!

714
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:20,894
Aah!

715
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:22,773
Don't worry,
Your Highness. I gotcha.

716
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,847
You're safe now.

717
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,252
Maybe I'm just new to
this whole rescuing thing,

718
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:31,673
but this, to me,

719
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:33,513
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

720
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,471
wouldn't you say?

721
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:35,929
No, no, no.
It's--It's ok.

722
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,041
This--This is
all right.

723
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:38,614
We can figure this out.

724
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,104
I hate you.

725
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:45,710
- No!
- Yaah!

726
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,433
Aah! Ow!

727
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:57,062
Whoo hoo hoo!

728
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:58,673
Aah!

729
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:00,016
Ow!

730
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:01,281
Ow!

731
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:02,316
Uhh!

732
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:08,569
I don't know about you,

733
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,064
but I'm getting
all funned out.

734
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,291
Uh-oh.

735
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,902
Don't tell me.

736
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,513
We're about to go over
a huge waterfall.

737
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,240
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?

738
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,428
Most likely.

739
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:18,962
Bring it on.

740
00:29:19,998 --> 00:29:21,686
Boo-yah!

741
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,335
Whoo!

742
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:51,487
Your Highness.

743
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:54,018
Your Highness,
can you hear me?

744
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:55,821
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.

745
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:58,276
Breathe!

746
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:01,574
Ohh. Why me?

747
00:30:08,592 --> 00:30:09,512
Ooh!

748
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,473
All right.

749
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:15,036
- Ohh!
- Aah!

750
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:19,639
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

751
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:23,474
For the last time,

752
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,351
it was not a kiss.

753
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,923
Well, whatever
you call it...

754
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,801
it was disgusting.

755
00:30:30,877 --> 00:30:31,836
And if
you would've done

756
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,370
what I ordered you to do
in the first place,

757
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:34,559
we all could've
been spared

758
00:30:34,674 --> 00:30:37,856
your little
kiss of life.

759
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:38,893
Aw!

760
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:40,542
But now that
you're here,

761
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:42,305
you will take me
back to the palace.

762
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:43,342
I'll have Yzma
change me back,

763
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:44,914
and then I'll start
construction

764
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,410
on Kuzcotopia.

765
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:47,369
Oh, yeah.

766
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:49,324
Ok, now, look,

767
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,703
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

768
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,007
Mm-hmm.

769
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,231
I just think if you really
thought about it,

770
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:56,343
you'd decide
to build your home

771
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,762
on a different hilltop.

772
00:30:57,878 --> 00:30:58,798
And why would I
do that?

773
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,020
Because...

774
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,554
deep down,
I think you'll realize

775
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,126
that you're forcing
an entire village

776
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,890
out of their homes
just for you.

777
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,652
And that's...

778
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:10,611
bad?

779
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:13,067
Well, yeah.

780
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,444
Nobody's
that heartless.

781
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,441
Mmm.

782
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,626
Now take me back.

783
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:19,624
What?
Wait, wait.

784
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:21,274
How can you
be this way?

785
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:23,038
All you care about
is building your summer home

786
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,802
and filling it
with stuff for you.

787
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,337
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.

788
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,562
Everyone else
in the kingdom gets it.

789
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:29,749
You're the only one
that doesn't seem to be

790
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,015
with the program,

791
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,396
eh, Pacha?

792
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:33,432
You know what?

793
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:35,465
Someday, you're going
to wind up all alone,

794
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,341
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

795
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:39,990
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.

796
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,410
Now, for the final time,

797
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,247
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

798
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,395
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here,

799
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,622
because unless
you change your mind,

800
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,039
I'm not taking you back.

801
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,568
Because unless
you change your mind,

802
00:31:53,683 --> 00:31:54,987
I'm not
taking you back.

803
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:58,209
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

804
00:31:58,324 --> 00:31:59,742
Huh? What?

805
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,508
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--

806
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:02,697
Somebody's
throwing stuff.

807
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,575
You going to build a fire
or what? What's going on?

808
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,526
He's never going
to change his mind.

809
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,359
Ohh. How am I ever going
to get out of here?

810
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,088
And so,

811
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,544
it is
with great sadness

812
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,614
that we mourn
the sudden departure

813
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:47,110
of our beloved prince...

814
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:50,409
taken from us
so tragically

815
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:53,246
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

816
00:32:53,323 --> 00:32:54,473
Poor little guy.

817
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,736
His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

818
00:32:56,814 --> 00:32:57,965
He never had
a chance.

819
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,726
for all eternity.

820
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:03,949
Well, he ain't gettin'
any deader.

821
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:05,022
Back to work.

822
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:20,019
Kronk, darlin',

823
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,203
I must admit
you had me worried

824
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,275
when you mixed up
those poisons,

825
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,845
but now that
Kuzco is dead,

826
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,303
all is forgiven.

827
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:29,990
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...

828
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,253
Heh. He's dead,
all right. Heh heh.

829
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:34,438
I mean, you can't get
much deader than he--

830
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:35,973
than he is right now.

831
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:38,197
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

832
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:41,037
I suppose.

833
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:43,337
Hey, look,
the royal dresser's here.

834
00:33:43,414 --> 00:33:44,641
Kronk...

835
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,441
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

836
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:48,400
Kronk...

837
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:51,467
I wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist.

838
00:33:51,544 --> 00:33:54,345
Kuzco is dead, right?

839
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:55,841
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

840
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,985
I need to hear
these words.

841
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,632
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

842
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:03,128
He's still alive?

843
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:05,468
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

844
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,887
Kronk...

845
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,843
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up

846
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,339
in case Kuzco
ever came back.

847
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:12,255
He can't come back!

848
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:14,174
Yeah. That would be
kind of awkward--

849
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,015
especially after
that lovely eulogy.

850
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:17,588
You think?

851
00:34:17,703 --> 00:34:19,543
You and I are going out
to find him.

852
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:21,309
If he talks,
we are through!

853
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:22,459
Now let's move!

854
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:24,414
Dad, look out!

855
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:27,252
Tipo, what is it?

856
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,285
I had a dream that
Dad was tied to a log

857
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,896
and was careening
out of control

858
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:33,005
down a raging river
of death!

859
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,309
All right, all right,
it's ok.

860
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:35,461
- It was awful!
- Shh!

861
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:37,071
It's ok, it's ok.
Tipo, calm down.

862
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:38,644
It was just a dream.

863
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:39,833
Your dad's fine.

864
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,557
He just went back
to see the emperor.

865
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,241
Oh. Like you
told him to,

866
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,621
'cause you're
always right.

867
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:47,964
That's right.

868
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,690
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

869
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,569
Yeah, like that
would ever happen.

870
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,256
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.

871
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:54,560
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

872
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:55,865
Yeah-huh.

873
00:34:58,319 --> 00:34:59,202
Good night, you two.

874
00:34:59,278 --> 00:35:00,237
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!

875
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:02,039
- Yeah-huh. Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.

876
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:09,979
Ooh!

877
00:35:11,782 --> 00:35:12,703
B-B-Brr!

878
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,581
Uh, hey

879
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:20,258
Thanks.

880
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:22,252
Oh.

881
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:23,749
No problem.

882
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,624
Feels like wool.

883
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:27,853
Yeah.

884
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,156
Alpaca?

885
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:30,575
Oh, yeah, it is.

886
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:33,145
Oh, yeah,
I thought so.

887
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:34,448
It's nice.

888
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:35,983
My wife made it.

889
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:37,287
Oh, she knits?

890
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:38,936
Crochets.

891
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:41,084
Crochets?
Nice.

892
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,848
Thanks.

893
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:49,752
So...

894
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:54,086
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

895
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:55,390
we'd, uh...

896
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:56,541
I mean, there's
lots of hilltops,

897
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:59,111
and maybe I might,
you know...

898
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,338
I--I might...

899
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:03,214
Are you saying...

900
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,749
you've changed
your mind?

901
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:06,513
Oh, well, l--I...

902
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,932
Because you know
that means

903
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:10,770
you're doing something
nice for someone else.

904
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:12,573
No, I know that.
I know.

905
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,491
And you're all right
with that?

906
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,449
Yes.

907
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,584
What?

908
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,646
Don't shake
unless you mean it.

909
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:36,582
All right.

910
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:40,572
Let's get you
back to the palace.

911
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,064
Oh, by the way,
thanks.

912
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,020
No...

913
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:46,669
thank you

914
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,438
ok.
Once we cross this bridge,

915
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:01,859
it's only an hour
to the palace.

916
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,239
Good, because
believe it or not,

917
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,428
I think I need a bath.

918
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:05,387
I believe it.

919
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:06,767
- What was that?
- Nothing.

920
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:08,339
Ohh!

921
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,797
Whoa!

922
00:37:09,912 --> 00:37:10,910
Kuzco!

923
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:13,862
Kuzco!

924
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:15,359
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!

925
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,079
No. I don't think
I will.

926
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:20,460
You're going
to leave me here?

927
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,607
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

928
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:24,180
but I kind of
like this better.

929
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:26,327
I thought you were
a changed man.

930
00:37:26,404 --> 00:37:27,364
Oh, come on.
I had to say something

931
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,050
to get you to take me
back to the city.

932
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:30,892
So all of it
was a lie?

933
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:32,925
Well, yeah.
No, wait.

934
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:37,068
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie.

935
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:38,754
Toodles.

936
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:40,251
We shook hands on it!

937
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:46,655
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

938
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,267
you need hands.

939
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:49,762
Ha! ok.

940
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:51,411
Buh-bye.

941
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:52,716
Aah!

942
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:54,288
Are you ok?
Are you all right?

943
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:55,745
Yeah.

944
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:56,743
Yeah. I think
I'm all right.

945
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,507
Good!

946
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:00,311
That's for going back
on your promise!

947
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:01,537
Yii!

948
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,568
Yeah. That's for
kidnapping me

949
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:04,913
and taking me
to your village...

950
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,715
which I'm still gonna
destroy, by the way.

951
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,671
Ah ha ha ha!
No touchy.

952
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,630
Ooh!

953
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,856
Why did I risk my life

954
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:12,507
for a selfish brat
like you?

955
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:14,463
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

956
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,110
but, ooh,
you proved me wrong.

957
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:18,182
Oh, boohoo.
Now I feel really bad.

958
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:19,295
Bad llama.

959
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:20,791
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

960
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:22,478
and then all my problems
would be over.

961
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:24,742
Well, that makes you
ugly and stupid.

962
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:25,931
Let's end this.

963
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,120
Ladies first.

964
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:30,149
- Aah! - Yaah!

965
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,088
Ohh!

966
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,110
- Aah!
- Aah!

967
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,872
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

968
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,787
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

969
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:53,661
What are we
gonna do?

970
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:55,770
Aah!

971
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,380
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

972
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:00,717
We're gonna die!
That's it for me!

973
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:01,715
No, we're not

974
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,402
Calm down.

975
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:06,317
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.

976
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,733
Ok, now
the other one.

977
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:12,722
When I say go,
push against my back,

978
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,679
and we'll walk
up the hill.

979
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:15,791
Ready?

980
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:16,788
Go.

981
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:17,746
Ow!

982
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,010
You did that
on purpose.

983
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,235
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!

984
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:23,499
Now, we're gonna have
to work together

985
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,493
to get out of this,
so follow my lead.

986
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,798
Ready?

987
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:27,948
- Right foot.
- Whose right?

988
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:29,445
Your right
or mine?

989
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,595
I don't care.
Mine.

990
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:31,785
Well, why yours?

991
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:32,935
Ok, your right!
Ready?

992
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:33,894
Ok, got it.

993
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:35,659
Ok, right.

994
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,345
Left. Right.

995
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:39,800
Ha ha!
Look, we're moving!

996
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:41,718
Aah!

997
00:39:41,794 --> 00:39:43,406
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me.

998
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:44,365
Stay with me.

999
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,090
Right. Left.

1000
00:39:46,205 --> 00:39:47,855
Right. Left.

1001
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,041
Right. Left.

1002
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,729
Right!

1003
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:54,336
Now what, genius?

1004
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:56,138
Working on it.

1005
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:58,325
Ok, here's the deal.

1006
00:39:58,402 --> 00:39:59,822
Stretch out your neck,

1007
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:01,433
and I'll grab the rope.

1008
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:02,927
How do I know
you won't let me fall

1009
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:04,079
after you grab
the rope?

1010
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:07,031
You're just gonna
have to trust me!

1011
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:11,366
You know,
it's a good thing

1012
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:12,747
you're not
a big, fat guy,

1013
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,664
or this would be
really difficult.

1014
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,621
Aah! Aah!

1015
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:18,001
Almost.

1016
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:19,343
Got it!

1017
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:21,491
It's stuck.

1018
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:24,446
Take your time.
No hurry here.

1019
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,168
Scorpions!
Aah ha ha!

1020
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:28,164
Kuzco!

1021
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:29,431
Aah!

1022
00:40:29,546 --> 00:40:31,078
Oh, no!

1023
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,991
Uhh!

1024
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:37,331
Aah!

1025
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:39,441
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1026
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:40,899
Huh?

1027
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:44,426
Aah!

1028
00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:45,999
Aah!

1029
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:49,222
Whoa!

1030
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,116
- Huh?

1031
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,033
Look out!

1032
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,415
Ohh!

1033
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,716
Pacha: Ohh

1034
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,443
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1035
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,861
Ooh, look at me
and my bad self.

1036
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:10,585
I snatched you
right out of the air.

1037
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,463
"Ooh, I'm
a crumbly canyon wall,

1038
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:14,114
and I'm taking you
with me."

1039
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,110
Well, not today, pal.

1040
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:16,223
Uh-huh.

1041
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:17,794
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1042
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:18,754
Uh-huh

1043
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:20,787
You just saved my life.

1044
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:21,784
Huh?

1045
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:24,086
So?

1046
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,311
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

1047
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:26,616
That there is some good
in you after all.

1048
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,575
Oh, no
- Admit it.

1049
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,880
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

1050
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:30,259
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.

1051
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:31,909
- Hey, you could've let me fall.
- Nuh-uh!

1052
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,021
Come on,
what's the big deal?

1053
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:34,749
Nobody's that heartless.

1054
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,314
Don't read
too much into it.

1055
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,848
It was a one-time thing.

1056
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:42,303
Right. Sure.

1057
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,260
Well, we better get going.

1058
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:45,448
With that bridge out,

1059
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:46,790
it's a 4-daywalk
to the palace.

1060
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,556
What?

1061
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:49,974
You mean you're still
taking me back?

1062
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,471
I shook on it,
didn't I?

1063
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:53,656
Well, yeah,
but I hope you realize

1064
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:54,959
that doesn't
change a thing.

1065
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:56,840
I'm still building
Kuzcotopia

1066
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:57,836
when I get back.

1067
00:41:57,913 --> 00:41:59,410
Well, 4 days
is a long time.

1068
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:01,020
Who knows? Maybe
you'll change your mind.

1069
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,017
Uh-huh.

1070
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:03,706
4 days.

1071
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:05,507
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

1072
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:06,964
Not good.

1073
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,222
No, no, no!

1074
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:12,450
We've searched
every village

1075
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:13,754
surrounding the palace

1076
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,555
and still
no sign of Kuzco.

1077
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,704
Where is he?

1078
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:18,664
Kronk!

1079
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,774
Kronk here.

1080
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:21,616
I'm getting tired.
Pull over.

1081
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:22,957
Sure thing.
Kronk out.

1082
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,517
Ooh! Aah!

1083
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:30,706
Aah! Ohh!

1084
00:42:34,503 --> 00:42:35,614
Perfect.

1085
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:38,378
These are my best shoes.

1086
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:42,596
I hate this jungle.

1087
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,281
Oh, look.

1088
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,313
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

1089
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:49,308
Just one more
for exotic bird bingo.

1090
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:50,266
Aah!

1091
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:51,916
I am loving this.

1092
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:01,696
Get away from me!

1093
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,191
Uhh

1094
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:06,261
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

1095
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:09,368
No, no,
it's not you.

1096
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:11,592
She's not the easiest
person to get close to.

1097
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:13,970
There's a wall there.
Trust me.

1098
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:16,002
Are you talking
to that squirrel?

1099
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:18,073
I was a junior chipmunk.

1100
00:43:18,188 --> 00:43:20,604
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

1101
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:21,679
Please continue.

1102
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:25,245
Aah!

1103
00:43:25,322 --> 00:43:26,818
Why me?

1104
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,045
Why me?

1105
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,270
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

1106
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:32,149
This poor little guy
has had it rough.

1107
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:33,416
Seems a talking llama

1108
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,295
Kronk: gave him a hard
time the other day

1109
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:37,748
Oh, a talking llama?

1110
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,475
Ha ha ha ha!
Do tell.

1111
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,587
Heh heh heh heh!

1112
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:44,652
Uh, he doesn't really
want to talk to you.

1113
00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:46,724
Well, then
you ask him.

1114
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:48,911
I hate being
in the middle.

1115
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,214
Squeaky, uh...

1116
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,055
squeak, squeaker,
squeakin'.

1117
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:54,701
Aah!

1118
00:43:54,855 --> 00:43:56,811
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.

1119
00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:05,364
Uh, could you give us
a little room here?

1120
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,630
Uh, sorry.

1121
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:09,698
Uh-uh.

1122
00:44:09,851 --> 00:44:12,153
A little bit more,
please.

1123
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:14,108
How is this?

1124
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:15,221
- Yeah, that's good.

1125
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:18,826
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

1126
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:22,316
Uh, squeakity-squeak,
squeakin'.

1127
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:34,474
Low blood sugar, huh?

1128
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,316
Yeah.
It's a curse. Ha.

1129
00:44:36,431 --> 00:44:37,658
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

1130
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:39,307
you're walking
the rest of the way.

1131
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:52,462
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,

1132
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,189
home of the mug...

1133
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,639
...of meat.
What'll it be?

1134
00:44:58,754 --> 00:45:01,132
Ahem. We'll have
2 specials.

1135
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:02,856
Is that all right,
dear?

1136
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:05,350
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

1137
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:07,650
Hee hee hee. We're
on our honeymoon.

1138
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:10,796
Bless you for
coming out in public.

1139
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,867
So that's 2 specials.

1140
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:16,050
And an onion log.
To split.

1141
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,656
Ordering!
I need 2 heartburns

1142
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:22,839
and a deep-fried doorstop
on table 1 2!

1143
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,327
Ok, so I'll admit
this was a good idea.

1144
00:45:27,404 --> 00:45:30,395
When will you learn that
all my ideas are good ones?

1145
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:31,813
That's funny,

1146
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,771
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

1147
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:35,227
being chased by jaguars,

1148
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:36,761
lying to me to take you
back to the palace

1149
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,603
were all really bad ideas.

1150
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:41,211
Anything sounds bad when
you say it with that attitude.

1151
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:46,236
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

1152
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:47,194
Mazeltov

1153
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:52,678
Oh, boy.

1154
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:57,933
Ooh. Ugh. Bluh.

1155
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,122
Urp!

1156
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:01,500
Oh, here
Let me get that for you

1157
00:46:01,615 --> 00:46:03,917
Bleaggh! Uck!

1158
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:05,987
Where are you going?

1159
00:46:06,102 --> 00:46:07,408
I'm just going to slip
into the kitchen

1160
00:46:07,523 --> 00:46:08,443
and have a word
with the chef.

1161
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,052
You're gonna get us
thrown out.

1162
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:12,507
Please.
With this disguise,

1163
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:14,464
I'm invisible.

1164
00:46:18,606 --> 00:46:19,450
Heh heh!

1165
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:21,368
We've been walking
around in circles

1166
00:46:21,483 --> 00:46:22,787
for who knows how long.

1167
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,704
That is the last time

1168
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,545
we take directions
from a squirrel.

1169
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,464
I should have done away
with Kuzco myself

1170
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:29,805
when I had the chance.

1171
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,060
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

1172
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:39,969
Uh-oh I'll get you
another one there, Yzma

1173
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:42,770
You using
that fork there, pal?

1174
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:43,843
Hey, don't I know you?

1175
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:44,840
I don't think so.

1176
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:46,298
Wrestled you
in high school?

1177
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,639
Don't remember that.

1178
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:48,715
Metal shop? I got it!

1179
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:50,670
Miss Narca's interpretive
dance--2 semesters.

1180
00:46:50,747 --> 00:46:53,432
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

1181
00:46:53,508 --> 00:46:55,196
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

1182
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:56,922
I don't think
we've ever met,

1183
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:58,112
but I gotta go.

1184
00:46:58,227 --> 00:46:59,261
Don't worry.
I'll think of it.

1185
00:46:59,376 --> 00:47:01,908
Look, all I know is
the food looked iffy.

1186
00:47:02,023 --> 00:47:03,864
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

1187
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:04,823
Psst! Hey!

1188
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:06,778
So I'm just
checking to make sure

1189
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:08,466
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

1190
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:10,883
Is there anything
on this menu

1191
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,148
that is not
swimming in gravy?

1192
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,530
Hang on.
I'll go ask the chef.

1193
00:47:13,645 --> 00:47:15,371
It's a simple
question.

1194
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,326
Is there or is there
not anything edible...

1195
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:18,630
- on this menu?
- Gah!

1196
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,463
Hey, I didn't ask him
about dessert yet!

1197
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,842
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

1198
00:47:25,957 --> 00:47:28,027
All right, buster,
that's it!

1199
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:29,447
You want a special order,
then you make it!

1200
00:47:29,523 --> 00:47:30,443
I quit!

1201
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,862
Yeah, but l--

1202
00:47:31,939 --> 00:47:33,474
I try and I try,
but there's no respect

1203
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:34,930
for anyone with vision.
That's it!

1204
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:36,464
There's just nothing
I can do about it!

1205
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:37,461
Please don't go.

1206
00:47:37,578 --> 00:47:39,840
3 pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

1207
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,527
2 chili cheese
samplers,

1208
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:43,178
a basket of
liver and onion rings,

1209
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:44,633
a catch of the day,

1210
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,744
and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

1211
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,010
You got all that, honey?

1212
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,734
3 oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

1213
00:47:49,888 --> 00:47:51,231
basket of
grandma's breakfast,

1214
00:47:51,308 --> 00:47:52,382
and change the bull
to a gill, got it.

1215
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:53,456
What's going on?

1216
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:54,991
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

1217
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:58,403
What is he
doing in there?

1218
00:48:01,165 --> 00:48:02,238
Unh! Come on!

1219
00:48:02,354 --> 00:48:04,003
In a minute.
I'm still hungry.

1220
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,230
No, Kuzco!

1221
00:48:05,307 --> 00:48:06,842
Ok, I'll make it simple
for you.

1222
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:08,606
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

1223
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,025
- You got it?
- Can do.

1224
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:12,479
What's taking so long?

1225
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,477
Pickup!

1226
00:48:13,553 --> 00:48:15,012
Kronk!
What are you doing?

1227
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:16,085
Kinda busy here.

1228
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,196
Why am I
not surprised?

1229
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,271
Your order's up!

1230
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:19,882
Ohh!

1231
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:22,259
Oh, well,
while you're at it,

1232
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:24,178
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

1233
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:25,174
Check. Pickup!

1234
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:26,631
You know what?
On second thought,

1235
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:27,745
make my omelet
a meat pie.

1236
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,742
Meat pie Check

1237
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:29,700
Kronk!

1238
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:33,076
Can I order the potatoes
as a side dish?

1239
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:34,111
I'll have to charge you
full price.

1240
00:48:34,226 --> 00:48:35,186
Ooh!

1241
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:36,950
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

1242
00:48:37,026 --> 00:48:38,214
You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

1243
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,710
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.

1244
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:40,939
Cheddar spuds
coming up.

1245
00:48:41,015 --> 00:48:41,897
Spuds yes,
cheese no.

1246
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:42,894
Hold the cheese.

1247
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:43,853
No, I want
the cheese

1248
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:45,081
Cheese me
no like.

1249
00:48:45,158 --> 00:48:46,192
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!

1250
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:47,151
Come on,
make up your mind!

1251
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:48,342
Ok, ok,
on second thought...

1252
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:49,876
Make
my potatoes a salad.

1253
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:07,594
Excuse me. You see
that woman over there?

1254
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:11,659
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

1255
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,759
Waiters: 1, 2, 3, 4

1256
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:18,717
Happy, happy birthday

1257
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,212
From all of us to you

1258
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:21,171
We wish
it was our birthday

1259
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:22,591
So we could party, too

1260
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:23,971
Happy, happy birthday

1261
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:25,008
May all your dreams
come true

1262
00:49:25,123 --> 00:49:27,960
Ha ha ha!
It's your birthday?

1263
00:49:29,918 --> 00:49:31,106
What are you doing?

1264
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,100
Look, there's 2 people
in there looking for you.

1265
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:34,097
What?

1266
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:35,247
A big guy
and a skinny old woman.

1267
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:37,397
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

1268
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:38,393
Oh, yeah.

1269
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:40,119
That's Yzma and Kronk!
I'm saved!

1270
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:42,267
Trust me, they're
not here to save you.

1271
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:43,494
They'll take me back
to the palace.

1272
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:45,182
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

1273
00:49:45,297 --> 00:49:46,370
I can take it from here.

1274
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:48,824
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

1275
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:50,627
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

1276
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:51,931
No. I can't let you!

1277
00:49:52,008 --> 00:49:53,926
What? Wha--

1278
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:55,691
Oh, I get it!

1279
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:56,764
What?

1280
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:58,261
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

1281
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:00,139
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

1282
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:01,289
No!

1283
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:02,824
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

1284
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:03,974
Will you just
listen to me--

1285
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:05,241
No, no,
you listen to me.

1286
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:08,194
All you care about
is your stupid hilltop!

1287
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,420
What?

1288
00:50:09,497 --> 00:50:10,956
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

1289
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:11,915
- Go!
- But--

1290
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:14,023
Go on! Get outta here!

1291
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,401
Fine! Hmph!

1292
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:18,473
Oh, this entire mess
is all your fault.

1293
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:19,893
What'd I do?

1294
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:21,924
If you hadn't mixed up
those poisons,

1295
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:23,497
Kuzco would be dead now!

1296
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:25,453
There'll be
no more diversions

1297
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,985
until we track that
llama down and kill him!

1298
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:30,017
Said I was sorry.
Can't just let it go.

1299
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:32,127
Not even
on your birthday.

1300
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:34,428
Kuzco must be eliminated

1301
00:50:34,544 --> 00:50:37,267
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug

1302
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:39,184
You got a point

1303
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:42,061
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

1304
00:50:43,595 --> 00:50:45,244
Pacha!

1305
00:50:50,077 --> 00:50:51,534
Pacha?

1306
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,812
So this is where you came in

1307
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:32,343
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here

1308
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,259
I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life

1309
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,295
and took everything I had

1310
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,253
Hey, give it a rest
up there, will you?

1311
00:51:37,368 --> 00:51:39,553
What? I’m just telling
them what happened

1312
00:51:39,668 --> 00:51:41,049
Who you kidding, pal?

1313
00:51:41,202 --> 00:51:43,197
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

1314
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:45,231
Well, yeah, but

1315
00:51:45,346 --> 00:51:46,956
Just leave me alone.

1316
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,640
The peasant at the diner!

1317
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,211
He didn't pay his check.

1318
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:32,329
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

1319
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:33,939
who disappeared
into the crowd

1320
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:35,512
with Kuzco
on the back of his cart.

1321
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:37,315
He must have taken him
back to his village,

1322
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:39,041
so if we find the village,
we find him,

1323
00:52:39,118 --> 00:52:40,767
and if we find him,
we find Kuzco.

1324
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:43,719
Oh, yeah,
it's all comin' together.

1325
00:52:44,064 --> 00:52:45,752
Yzma!

1326
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:46,942
What?!

1327
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:48,016
Aah!

1328
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,390
This had
better be good!

1329
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:52,143
Yeech.

1330
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:55,902
So, there we were
standing on the cliff,

1331
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:58,204
and the ground
started to rumble

1332
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,198
And just as
it started to go,

1333
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:01,886
he grabbed me
before I fell

1334
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:03,534
Do you believe that?

1335
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:04,953
You know, call me crazy

1336
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,872
for following this guy
all the way out here,

1337
00:54:06,948 --> 00:54:08,596
but as much
as he tries to deny it,

1338
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:10,132
I know
there's some good in him

1339
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,969
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

1340
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:15,654
He's a lousy llama.

1341
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:19,912
I mean,
a really lousy llama.

1342
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:32,147
Hey, listen, Pacha,

1343
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:35,100
you know, what I said to you
back at the diner,

1344
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:38,092
that--that--
I--I didn't really...

1345
00:54:38,168 --> 00:54:40,891
So...you tired of
being a llama?

1346
00:54:41,966 --> 00:54:44,458
Ye-ee-ee-es!

1347
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:47,374
Ok, we're just gonna
stop at the house

1348
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:48,523
and get some supplies.

1349
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:50,058
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

1350
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:53,088
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1351
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,086
My relatives?

1352
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:55,428
We just sent them
up to your house.

1353
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,153
What did
they look like?

1354
00:54:57,268 --> 00:54:59,072
See, there was
this big guy

1355
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:00,414
and this older woman
who was...

1356
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,446
How would
you describe her?

1357
00:55:02,523 --> 00:55:03,943
Scary beyond all reason.

1358
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:05,361
Yeah, that's it.

1359
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:08,507
So, remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

1360
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,231
Why, I'm his
third cousin's brother's

1361
00:55:10,346 --> 00:55:13,492
wife's step-niece's
great-aunt. Heh heh.

1362
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:16,638
Twice removed.

1363
00:55:16,753 --> 00:55:17,711
Uh-huh.

1364
00:55:17,826 --> 00:55:19,629
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1365
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:21,969
99 monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

1366
00:55:22,046 --> 00:55:24,960
One fell off
and bumped his head

1367
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:28,604
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way,

1368
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,330
but as I said to you before,

1369
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:33,091
you may recall,
Pacha is not here.

1370
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:34,626
I'll be sure and tell him
you came by.

1371
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:38,652
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1372
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:41,069
Oops. Silly me.

1373
00:55:41,185 --> 00:55:43,370
No, no. Allow me.

1374
00:55:48,126 --> 00:55:49,508
She's hiding something.

1375
00:55:49,585 --> 00:55:50,925
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1376
00:55:51,002 --> 00:55:52,652
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

1377
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,186
Grr!

1378
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:57,332
So, while we're
waiting for Paca--

1379
00:55:57,408 --> 00:55:58,942
Pacha.

1380
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:00,360
Oh, yes.

1381
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:02,778
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1382
00:56:02,855 --> 00:56:04,694
You know, why don't
you just come back

1383
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,191
when Pacha gets home?

1384
00:56:06,268 --> 00:56:09,184
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

1385
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,101
Excuse me, won't you?

1386
00:56:11,178 --> 00:56:13,824
I think I left
something in the oven.

1387
00:56:13,901 --> 00:56:15,741
This is my variation
of double-dutch.

1388
00:56:15,818 --> 00:56:17,122
On the signal,
we switch places.

1389
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,502
Kronk, it's time!

1390
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,461
ok!

1391
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:21,187
Ohh!

1392
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:23,029
So, we have to get
back to the palace,

1393
00:56:23,144 --> 00:56:24,524
find the lab,
and change him back.

1394
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:25,521
Hi there!

1395
00:56:25,597 --> 00:56:26,481
Aah!

1396
00:56:26,558 --> 00:56:28,897
- That was him.
- Whoops.

1397
00:56:30,662 --> 00:56:31,735
You know what?

1398
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,882
I don't believe you're
really my great-aunt.

1399
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:36,107
You're more like
my great-great-great...

1400
00:56:36,222 --> 00:56:37,794
Go. I'll stall them
long enough

1401
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:38,831
for you two to get
a head start.

1402
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:40,288
Thanks, honey.

1403
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:42,206
You have a lovely wife.

1404
00:56:42,321 --> 00:56:43,395
They're both very pretty.

1405
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:44,584
Great-great-
great...

1406
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:47,076
Grr! All right!

1407
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:48,879
Are you through?

1408
00:56:48,956 --> 00:56:49,837
...great-great-aunt.

1409
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:50,835
So, where were we?

1410
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,255
Listen, sister, we're
not leaving until--

1411
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,134
I show you the house.
Of course.

1412
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,471
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1413
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:00,117
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1414
00:57:00,232 --> 00:57:02,034
What do you mean,
the door is stuck?

1415
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,684
Try jiggling the handle.

1416
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:05,371
There is no handle
in here.

1417
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:07,596
There's not?
Are you sure?

1418
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:09,514
All right, I've had
enough of this.

1419
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,471
Tell us where
the talking llama is

1420
00:57:11,586 --> 00:57:13,003
and we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1421
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,652
Uh,
don't you mean "or"?

1422
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:17,031
Tell us where
the talking llama is

1423
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:19,026
or we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1424
00:57:19,141 --> 00:57:20,483
Well, which is it?

1425
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,745
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1426
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:24,932
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!

1427
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:26,849
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?

1428
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:28,192
This is hand-carved
mahogany.

1429
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:30,531
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.

1430
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:31,874
I'll break it down myself.

1431
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:33,217
A-one

1432
00:57:33,293 --> 00:57:34,597
Ok, kids,
you know what to do.

1433
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:36,861
Right, Mom!

1434
00:57:37,014 --> 00:57:37,972
3!

1435
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,465
Aah!

1436
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:51,473
Ok, children,
on your mark,

1437
00:57:51,588 --> 00:57:53,621
get set, go!

1438
00:57:55,193 --> 00:57:57,801
Ow! Ow! Stop it,
you little brats! Huh?

1439
00:57:59,105 --> 00:58:00,178
Ow!

1440
00:58:00,255 --> 00:58:03,785
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1441
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,929
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.

1442
00:58:07,006 --> 00:58:08,848
Let's not wait until
the next family reunion

1443
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:10,075
to get together.

1444
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:11,187
Kronk!

1445
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:13,680
I, uh, I gotta run.

1446
00:59:19,074 --> 00:59:21,298
Ok, why does she even
have that lever?

1447
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:25,787
Please remain seated

1448
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:27,703
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

1449
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:30,234
Aah!

1450
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:32,689
Huh?

1451
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:36,180
What does it look like?

1452
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:37,598
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

1453
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:38,903
Over here!

1454
00:59:39,018 --> 00:59:42,852
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1455
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:44,694
Oh, my

1456
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:47,225
Looking for this?

1457
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:50,255
No! It can't be!

1458
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,173
How did you get
back here before us?

1459
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:55,625
Uh...how did we, Kronk?

1460
00:59:55,702 --> 00:59:57,044
Well, you got me.

1461
00:59:57,121 --> 00:59:58,885
By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

1462
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,072
Oh, well,
back to business.

1463
01:00:01,187 --> 01:00:02,529
Ok, I admit it.

1464
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:04,600
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1465
01:00:04,715 --> 01:00:07,324
but, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

1466
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,737
Just think of it
as you're being let go,

1467
01:00:10,813 --> 01:00:12,731
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1468
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:16,183
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1469
01:00:16,298 --> 01:00:18,101
Hey, that's kind of like
what he said to you

1470
01:00:18,216 --> 01:00:19,290
when you got fired.

1471
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,166
I know. It's called
a cruel irony--

1472
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,083
like my dependence
on you.

1473
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,695
I can't believe
this is happening!

1474
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:27,920
Then I bet you weren't
expecting this

1475
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:29,339
- No!
- Aah!

1476
01:00:29,454 --> 01:00:30,835
Aha!

1477
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:32,330
Oh, ok.

1478
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:34,364
Ha ha!
Finish them off.

1479
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,584
Hey, you're
not backing down now,

1480
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:39,425
are you, big guy?

1481
01:00:40,499 --> 01:00:43,453
Uh, where's the other guy?

1482
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,412
Yo!

1483
01:00:44,488 --> 01:00:46,905
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?

1484
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:48,516
Well, Yzma just
tossed me this knife

1485
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,855
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1486
01:00:50,932 --> 01:00:53,654
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1487
01:00:53,769 --> 01:00:54,690
and quite honestly--

1488
01:00:54,805 --> 01:00:57,452
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1489
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:58,872
This one simple thing.

1490
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:00,329
It's like I'm talking
to a monkey.

1491
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:01,441
Whoa now.

1492
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:04,432
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1493
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:05,430
Ouch.

1494
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:06,964
And do you want
to know something else?

1495
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,419
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

1496
01:01:09,534 --> 01:01:10,915
Never!

1497
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,788
That's it.
She's going down.

1498
01:01:14,865 --> 01:01:16,706
Now, now,
remember, guys.

1499
01:01:16,782 --> 01:01:19,391
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

1500
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,610
That'll work.

1501
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,661
Strange.
That usually works.

1502
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:33,888
And so does this!

1503
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:35,653
Ah. Should have
seen that coming.

1504
01:01:35,806 --> 01:01:37,225
Whoa!

1505
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,028
Aah!

1506
01:01:39,104 --> 01:01:41,828
Give me that vial!

1507
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:42,786
Oof!.

1508
01:01:42,863 --> 01:01:44,551
Ah! Ha ha!

1509
01:01:44,628 --> 01:01:46,008
Aah!

1510
01:01:49,651 --> 01:01:51,762
Oops. Clumsy me.

1511
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:55,098
Which one? Which one?

1512
01:01:56,709 --> 01:02:00,277
Better hurry
I'm expecting company

1513
01:02:03,612 --> 01:02:07,065
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!

1514
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,749
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me--Kuzco!

1515
01:02:09,864 --> 01:02:11,666
They're not
listening to me!

1516
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,585
Just take 'em all!

1517
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,426
- Yaah!
- Yaah!

1518
01:02:20,797 --> 01:02:21,678
Get them!

1519
01:02:21,755 --> 01:02:23,518
Hey, I've been
turned into a cow.

1520
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:25,053
Can I go home?

1521
01:02:25,168 --> 01:02:26,740
You're excused.
Anyone else?

1522
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:28,274
All: No, we're good.

1523
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,425
Get them!

1524
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,570
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

1525
01:02:35,064 --> 01:02:36,941
Uh, Pacha?
A little help!

1526
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,855
Come on!
Come on!

1527
01:02:45,573 --> 01:02:47,913
Aah!

1528
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:50,099
Oh, please be
something with wings.

1529
01:02:52,398 --> 01:02:55,047
Yeah! We're flyin'!

1530
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:56,503
Uh-oh!

1531
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:03,178
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

1532
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:04,403
I'm picking the next one!

1533
01:03:04,518 --> 01:03:05,900
Fine by me!

1534
01:03:05,977 --> 01:03:07,012
Give me that one!

1535
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:09,888
Don't you say a word.

1536
01:03:10,005 --> 01:03:13,570
- Aah!
- Aah!

1537
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:16,601
Quick!
Drain the canals!

1538
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,400
Pacha: Open up!

1539
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,463
Yay! I'm a llama again!

1540
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,614
Wait...

1541
01:03:27,532 --> 01:03:28,835
- Aah!
- Aah!

1542
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:36,392
There they go!
After them!

1543
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:39,345
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

1544
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,565
Aah!

1545
01:03:43,642 --> 01:03:46,669
Grr!

1546
01:03:53,727 --> 01:03:56,719
Aah!

1547
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,941
Ok, only 2 left. It's
gotta be one of these.

1548
01:04:04,429 --> 01:04:05,311
No!

1549
01:04:07,765 --> 01:04:12,292
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1550
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,167
Meow.

1551
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:17,545
I'll take that.

1552
01:04:17,622 --> 01:04:19,962
This is the one. This'll
change you back to a human.

1553
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:23,605
Ow! Hey, get her off!.

1554
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,603
Whoa!

1555
01:04:24,679 --> 01:04:25,945
Get her off me!

1556
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:30,011
Aah! Ow!

1557
01:04:33,808 --> 01:04:34,882
Drink the potion!

1558
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,684
Ok, ok! Aah!

1559
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:38,907
Where did it go?
Where is it?

1560
01:04:38,985 --> 01:04:41,363
Looking for this?

1561
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,127
Is that my voice?

1562
01:04:43,204 --> 01:04:44,545
Is that my voice?

1563
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:46,580
Oh, well.

1564
01:04:46,656 --> 01:04:47,769
No! Don't drop it!

1565
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,224
I'm not going
to drop it, you fool!

1566
01:04:50,339 --> 01:04:52,447
I'm going to drink it!

1567
01:04:52,562 --> 01:04:55,324
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

1568
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:57,242
I'm going to kill you!

1569
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:01,077
Ha ha ha!

1570
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:07,100
Aah!

1571
01:05:07,176 --> 01:05:08,441
Aah! Uh-oh.

1572
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:09,861
Yzma: Aah!

1573
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:13,388
Aah!

1574
01:05:14,694 --> 01:05:17,302
Aah! Aah!

1575
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:24,243
Uhh! Whoa!

1576
01:05:25,393 --> 01:05:27,848
Uhh! Oh-oh-oh!

1577
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:30,150
Kuzco!

1578
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,607
Be right there!
Give me a minute!

1579
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:34,099
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

1580
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:35,596
Kuzco! Whoa!

1581
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:38,665
Kuzco!

1582
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:42,270
Aah!

1583
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:43,689
Oh.

1584
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:46,564
The vial!

1585
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:55,041
Aah!

1586
01:05:55,157 --> 01:05:56,576
For the last time,

1587
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,608
we did not order
a giant trampoline.

1588
01:05:58,723 --> 01:06:00,219
You know, pal, you
could have told me that

1589
01:06:00,296 --> 01:06:01,906
before I set it up.

1590
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,551
Aah!

1591
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,737
Aah! Uhh--

1592
01:06:07,814 --> 01:06:09,002
Huh? Ha ha ha.

1593
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:11,419
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1594
01:06:11,495 --> 01:06:13,106
Hoo hoo hee hee
ha ha ha--

1595
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:17,824
The vial!

1596
01:06:17,901 --> 01:06:19,896
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

1597
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:37,961
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1598
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,110
I win.

1599
01:06:39,225 --> 01:06:40,108
Whoa.

1600
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:44,057
Got it!

1601
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,935
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

1602
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,272
Yeah!

1603
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:52,267
Uhh.

1604
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:56,675
Here, uh, let me
get this for you.

1605
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:01,932
Well, see ya
on the other side.

1606
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:12,095
Old man: Oh, now,
you--you

1607
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:14,051
you stop being
so hard on yourself.

1608
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:15,010
All is forgiven.

1609
01:07:15,087 --> 01:07:16,199
You're sure?

1610
01:07:16,275 --> 01:07:18,538
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

1611
01:07:18,653 --> 01:07:20,112
and it won't be the last.

1612
01:07:20,227 --> 01:07:22,183
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.

1613
01:07:22,259 --> 01:07:23,447
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.

1614
01:07:23,524 --> 01:07:25,671
Oh! Hey, I got to
use that arm later.

1615
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:27,399
Ok, buddy, take care.

1616
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,891
Ha ha.
Ah, he's a sweet guy.

1617
01:07:39,327 --> 01:07:41,743
So, you lied to me

1618
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:43,660
I did?

1619
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:45,846
Yeah. You said
when the sun

1620
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,113
hits this ridge
just right,

1621
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:48,608
these hills sing.

1622
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,718
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

1623
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,015
and I did not hear
any singing.

1624
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:56,702
So

1625
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:58,273
I'll be building
my summer home

1626
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:02,185
on a more magical hill.
Thank you.

1627
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,018
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

1628
01:08:07,172 --> 01:08:08,821
No, no, I'm sharp,
I'm on it.

1629
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:10,048
Looks like you
and your family

1630
01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:12,312
are stuck on that tuneless
hill top forever, pal.

1631
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:23,242
You know, I'm pretty sure
I heard some singing

1632
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:25,697
on the hill next to us.

1633
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,154
In case you're interested.

1634
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:33,252
Ha! Boom, baby!

1635
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:35,399
Ha! Boom, baby!

1636
01:08:39,313 --> 01:08:40,693
You'd be the coolest dude

1637
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:42,035
In the nation

1638
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,837
Or the hippest cat
in creation

1639
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:46,906
But if you ain't got friends,
then nothing's worth the fuss

1640
01:08:48,555 --> 01:08:50,434
A perfect world
will come to be

1641
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:52,737
When everybody here
can see

1642
01:08:52,852 --> 01:08:54,961
That a perfect world
begins and ends

1643
01:08:55,076 --> 01:08:57,108
A perfect world
begins and ends

1644
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:59,831
A perfect world
begins and ends with us

1645
01:09:01,059 --> 01:09:02,746
" My acorn
is missing."

1646
01:09:02,823 --> 01:09:04,741
Squeak squeakin'
squeak squeakity.

1647
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:06,314
" Did you eat
the acorn?"

1648
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,423
Squeaker squeak
squeak squeakin'?

1649
01:09:08,538 --> 01:09:10,263
"You owe me
a new acorn."

1650
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,527
Squeak squeak squeak
squeak squeaker--

1651
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,633
Squeakin'.

1652
01:09:16,154 --> 01:09:16,748
I'm so proud of you guys.
