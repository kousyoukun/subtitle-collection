13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,300
I believe in the church of baseball.

14
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,845
I've tried all the major religions
and most of the minor ones.

15
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,098
I've worshipped Buddha,
Allah, Brahma, Vishnu,

16
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,518
Shiva, trees, mushrooms,
and Isadora Duncan.

17
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,812
I know things.

18
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,982
For instance,
there ard 108 beads in a Catholic rosary,

19
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,319
and there are 108 stitches in a baseball.

20
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:53,821
When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance.

21
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,366
But it just didn't work out between us.

22
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,328
The Lord laid too much guilt on me.

23
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,164
I prefer metaphysics to theology.

24
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,959
You see, there's no guilt in baseball,
and it's never boring.

25
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,128
Which makes it like sex.

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,425
There's never been a ballplayer slept with me
who didn't have the best year of his career.

27
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,221
Making love is like hitting a baseball.

28
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,681
You just gotta relax and concentrate.

29
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,186
Besides, I'd never sleep with a player
hitting under .250,

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,689
unless he had a lot of RBIs
or was a great glove man up the middle.

31
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,696
You see, there's a certain amount
of life wisdom I give these boys.

32
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,782
I can expand their minds.

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,826
Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone,

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,496
I'll just read Emily Dickinson
or Walt Whitman to him.

35
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,165
And the guys are so sweet.
They always stay and listen.

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,044
Of course, a guy'll listen to anything
if he thinks it's foreplay.

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,756
I make them feel confident,

38
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,217
and they make me feel safe.

39
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,718
And pretty.

40
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,180
Of course, what I give them lasts a lifetime.

41
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,392
What they give me lasts 142 games.

42
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,603
Sometimes it seems like a bad trade,

43
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,772
but bad trades are part of baseball.

44
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,860
I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson
for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?

45
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,113
It's a long season, and you gotta trust it.

46
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,282
I've tried them all, I really have,

47
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,536
and the only church
that truly feeds the soul, day in, day out,

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,997
is the church of baseball.

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,787
Where's Ebby?

64
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,790
-Ain't he warming up yet?
-No.

65
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,585
His professional debut tonight,
and he forgets about it.

66
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,504
Better find our bonus baby, eh?

67
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,631
You seen Ebby?

68
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,341
Nope.

69
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,434
Ebby!

70
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,478
Oww!

71
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,146
Jesus.

72
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,317
Game starts in four minutes.
Why ain't you warm?

73
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,194
-I am warm.
-Jesus, Ebby!

74
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,738
This is your professional debut tonight.

75
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,908
Million guys give their left nut
to be in your shoes,

76
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,911
and you're leaving your fastball
in the locker room for some piece of ass!

77
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,329
Skip!

78
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:53,376
It is me.
I am not some quote-piece of ass-unquote.

79
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,253
Oh. Millie.

80
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,755
Geez. Sorry.

81
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,548
Didn't recognize you.

82
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,968
Uh, don't take this personal, Millie,

83
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,304
but if I catch you in here again,
you're banned from the ballpark.

84
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,475
You can't ban me from the ballpark
'cause my daddy donated that scoreboard,

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,812
and if you ban me
he just might take that scoreboard away.

86
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,189
Well, what do we need a scoreboard for?

87
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,441
We ain't scored any runs all year.

88
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,819
Now, you get your ass out there!

89
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,529
Hey, boss, I got a question.

90
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,280
What?

91
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,658
Do you think I need a nickname?
I think I need a nickname.

92
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,327
We were talking about it.
All the great ones have nicknames.

93
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,579
Like Oil Can, Catfish –
What was the one you were –

94
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,457
-Pokey.
-Yeah. What do you think of Pokey?

95
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,959
You got three minutes.

96
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,921
Goddamn son-of-a-bitchin'
motherfuckin' shithead!

97
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,049
-Time for another quickie.
-Jesus.

98
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,468
You got a game to pitch.

99
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,470
We got three minutes.

100
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,607
Come on, folks.

101
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,611
Let's hear it for Max Patkin,
the clown prince of baseball.

102
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,071
Let's go! Come on!

103
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,074
And now, the greatest show on dirt,

104
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,702
your own Durham Bulls!

105
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,625
I'm there.

106
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,002
I'm ready.

107
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,844
And now, WRDU Radio presents
the voice of the Durham Bulls, Teddy Garland.

108
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,847
The Bulls are off to a slow start,
having dropped their first three games,

109
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,558
but hope to turn it around tonight
with the professional debut

110
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,227
of heralded young pitcher
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

111
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,480
Let's play ball! Play ball!

112
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,651
Millie, you gotta stay out of the clubhouse.
You're gonna get everybody in trouble.

113
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,320
I got lured.

114
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,699
You did not get lured. Women do not get lured.
They are too strong and powerful for that.

115
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,495
Now say it. "I did not get lured.
I accept full responsibility for my actions."

116
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,748
I did not get lured.
I accept full responsibility for my actions.

117
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,085
That's better. Okay.
Now, you got your radar ready?

118
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,587
-Ready.
-Go to it.

119
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,842
Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox
is lead-off hitter Willie Foster.

120
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,304
The word on LaLoosh here is that the good-lookin'
young pitcher has a major-league fastball,

121
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,848
but sometimes has problems
with his control.

122
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,823
Oh, my – Damn!

123
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,409
One ball, no strikes to Willie Foster.

124
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,788
That's right, kid! Come on!
If you can't strike him out, just kill him!

125
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,873
- Come on!
- Here we go! Settle down!

126
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,669
No problem, Ebby, no problem! Go get him!
One-two-three, babe! Go get 'em, big guy!

127
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,131
Ninety-five miles an hour.

128
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,175
Why, that's great. He looks just great.

129
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,058
Take your base, man!

130
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,228
Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox,

131
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,313
second baseman Allen Powley.

132
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,731
What's it say?

133
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,444
It says he's not bending his back
on his follow-through.

134
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,155
Scotty!

135
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,198
Baby, take this to Ebby Calvin.

136
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,078
All right, honey, let's get down to it.
How was Ebby Calvin LaLoosh?

137
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:21,959
Well, he fucks like he pitches –

I'm the player to be named later.

Crash Davis? I'm Joe Riggins.

162
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,207
And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me

163
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,876
'cause five years ago in the Texas League,

164
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,380
you were pitching for El Paso,
I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport.

165
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:53,717
You hung a curveball on an 0-2 pitch
in a 3-2 game in the bottom of the eighth,

166
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,971
and I tattooed it. . .

167
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,765
over the Michelin Tire sign
and beat you 4-3.

168
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,435
I remember. I shoulda throwed a slider.
Damn, Crash, how you doing, man?

169
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,689
I'm too old for this shit.

170
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,108
Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?

171
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,111
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

172
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,571
Big club's got a hundred grand in him.

173
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,157
He's got a million-dollar arm,
but a five-cent head.

174
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,910
Had a gun on him tonight.

175
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,955
The last five pitches he threw
were faster than the first five.

176
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,001
He's got the best young arm
I've seen in 30 years.

177
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,171
You've been around.
You're smart. You're a professional.

178
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,174
We want you to mature the kid.

179
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,136
We want you to room with him on the road,

180
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,555
stay on his case all year.

181
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,266
- He can go all the way.
- Yeah?

182
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,310
Where can I go?

183
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,688
You can keep going to the ballpark
and keep gettin' paid to do it.

184
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,318
-Beats the hell out of working at Sears.
-Sears sucks, Crash.

185
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,321
Boy, I once worked there.
I sold Lady Kenmores.

186
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,905
Nasty. Ooh, nasty work.

187
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,869
And even if it is the Carolina League,
this is a chance to play every day.

188
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,204
You don't want a player.
You want a stable pony.

189
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,164
No.

190
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,124
While my triple-A contract gets bought out

191
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,668
so I can hold the Flavor-of-the-Month's dick
in the bus leagues.

192
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,796
Is that it? Well, fuck this fucking game!

193
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,515
I fucking quit.

194
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,434
All right? I quit.

195
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,038
-Who do we play tomorrow?
-Winston-Salem.

196
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,582
Batting practice 11 :30.

197
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,922
So how's it feel to get
your first professional win?

198
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,467
It feels out there. Um, it's a major rush.

199
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,970
I mean it doesn't just feel out there.
It feels out there. You know?

200
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,432
Um, it's kinda radical in a kind of tubular way.
You know?

201
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,518
But most of all, it's out there.

202
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,977
This is hopeless.

203
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,522

00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,211
These are the ground rules.

322
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,921
I hook up with one guy a season.

323
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,715
Usually takes me a couple of weeks
to pick the guy.

324
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,717
Kinda my own spring training.

325
00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:01,097
And, well, you two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

326
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,934
So I just thought we should
kinda get to know each other.

327
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,436
Time out.

328
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,396
Why do you get to choose?

329
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,774
-What?
-Why do you get to choose?

330
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,819
I mean, why don't I get to choose?
Why doesn't he get to choose?

331
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:18,156
Well, actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

332
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,202
I mean, it's all a question of quantum physics,
molecular attraction, and timing.

333
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,330
There are laws we don't understand
that bring us together and tear us apart.

334
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,583
It's like pheromones.

335
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,628
You get three ants together,
they can't do dick.

00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,048

they can build a cathedral.

00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,191
After 12 years in the minor leagues,
I don't try out.

341
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:58,154
Besides, uh, I don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

342
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,449
What do you believe in then?

343
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,244
Well, I believe in the soul,

344
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,080
the cock, the pussy,

345
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,165
the small of a woman's back,

346
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,960
the hanging curveball,
high fiber, good Scotch,

347
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,547
that the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

348
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,674
I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

349
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,093
I believe there oughta be
a constitutional amendment

350
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,387
outlawing Astroturf
and the designated hitter.

351
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,432
I believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography,

352
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,143
opening your presents Christmas morning
rather than Christmas Eve,

353
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,731
and I believe in long, slow, deep,
soft, wet kisses that last three days.

354
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,818
Good night.

355
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,445
Oh, my.

356
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,447
Crash.

357
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,116
Hey, Annie, what's all this molecule stuff?

358
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,076
Crash.

359
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,870
Crash, wait.

360
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,832
Look, alls I want is a date.
I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.

361
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,544
I'm not interested in a woman
who's interested in. . . that boy.

362
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,712
Good night.

363
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,173
-Well, I'm not interested yet.
-Who you calling a boy?

364
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,883
See you at the yard, Meat.

365
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,553
Damn. Nobody's ever said no
to a date with me before.

366
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,680
He's crazy.

367
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,265
I want you bad.

368
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,817
Honey, hold on. Slow down.

369
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,613
I want to watch.

370
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,409
Go ahead. Put it back on.

371
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,080
Jesus. What kind of chick are you?

372
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,501
When you know how to make love,
then you'll know how to pitch.

373
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,879
I know how to pitch.

374
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,548
Good.

00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,488
Gonna be leading a daily chapel service here
in the locker rooms at 3:00 in the afternoon.

Amen, brother! Amen!

00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,201
Y'all are invited to stop on by

Jimmy, goddamn it, loosen up and get laid.

Yeah!

Here we go.

00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,218
Jesus, Ebby.
You look like a truck ran over you, man.

427
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,139
Nuke. Call me Nuke.

428
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,809
Annie says that's my new nickname.

429
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,311
Okay, Nuke.

430
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,812
Go get 'em, Nuke.

431
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:26,733
Annie nailed you? That's great.
That means you're gonna have a great year.

432
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,529
Is she, uh, as good as they say?

433
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,533
No, man, we didn't fuck.

434
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,829
No, she read poetry to me all night.

435
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,040
It was more tiring than fucking.

436
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,547
"Limpid jets of love."

437
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,343
Hey – Hey, Crash.

438
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,303
Does that mean what I think it means?

439
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,180
"Limpid jets of love"?

440
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,641
Your shower shoes have fungus on them.

441
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,937
You'll never make it to the bigs
with fungus on your shower shoes.

442
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,773
Think classy, you'll be classy.

443
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,566
If you win 20 in the show,

444
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,152
you can let the fungus grow back
on your shower shoes,

445
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,071
and the press'll think you're colorful.

446
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:17,909
Until you win 20 in the show, however,
it means you're a slob.

447
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,459
Y'all don't forget, Saturday is Bull Day

448
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,711
down at the Northgate Mall.

449
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,797
Strike!

450
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,175
Whoa! Too bad, Butch. Too bad.

451
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,928
Charge!

452
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,140
You're not getting
that cheese by me, Meat.

453
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:45,311
And now batting for the Bulls,
number 8, Crash Davis.

454
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,688
Batter up.

455
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,823
Foul ball!

456
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,283
Foul –

457
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,452
Stupid fuck, Crash. What are you
swinging at a breaking ball for?

458
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,037
Fuck me.

459
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,169
Usually starts me off with the hammer.

460
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,380
You're thinking too much, Crash.
You're thinking too much.

461
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,883
Get out of your fuckin' head.
Don't let him in your kitchen.

462
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,637
Come on, Crash. Just relax.
You got it, honey.

463
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:22,640
All right, here we go now.
Stay back. Relax.

464
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,351
Quick bat. Quick bat, quick ba –

465
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,020
Foul ball!

466
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:34,652
Throw that shit again, Meat.
You throw that weak-ass shit again.

467
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,072
Okay, just got a piece of it there.
You got it. You got it.

468
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,325
One more, baby. One more. You got him.
Come on, Crash.

469
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,494
All right,
he's gonna throw the deuce now. Okay?

470
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,996
He's gotta waste one.

471
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,333
Stay back and wipe that silly grin
off his face.

472
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,044
Come on, bring it. Bring it.

473
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,879
- Hey!
- Jesus Christ!

474
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,881
What was that? What the hell was that?

475
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,841
Okay, babe.
What goes around comes around!

476
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,302
Son of a bitch throws hard.

477
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,431
It's okay, Crash. You take it easy, honey.

478
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,975
Go, Crash!

479
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,479
All right. 1 and 2.
You can hit this shit. Relax.

480
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,481
Annie.

481
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,982
Annie? Annie?

482
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,776
Who's this Annie?

483
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,445
Jesus. Get out of the box, you idiot.
Where's your head?

484
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,530
Get the broad out of your head!

485
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,491
- Time out.
- Time out!

486
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,826
Take your time.

487
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:24,994
Give me a rag.

488
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,083
Get a hit, Crash.

489
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,251
Shut up.

490
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,924
Come on, baby!

491
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,887
All right, you've seen all his pitches.

492
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,639
You've seen them all.

493
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,557
Just shorten up, Crash.

494
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,060
Now bring me the gas, kid.

495
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,188
-Bring me the gas.
-Bring me the gas.

496
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,441
Quick bat, quick bat, quick bat, qui –

497
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,027
Stree!

498
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,451
Scotty, baby, take this to Crash.

499
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,415
Folks, we have a little lost girl up here.

500
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:14,210
Says her name is Lyda Anne Baker.

501
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,629
-She'll be waiting at the main ticket box. . .
-Give it to Crash.

502
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,381
for her daddy, Cedar Baker.

503
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,049
Cedar, come on, get your little girl.

504
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,217
-Crash?
-What?

505
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,219
Note from Annie.

506
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,637
Read it.

507
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,852
"Dear Crash, You have a lovely swing,

508
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,604
but you're pulling your hips out too early.

509
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,567
I'd be happy to meet with you tomorrow
at the batting cage to discuss it."

510
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,943
Signed Annie.

511
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:43,739
Well, if there was one chick who'd know
you're pulling your hips out early, it'd be Annie.

512
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,626
It's kind of a personal note, kid,
so don't read it.

513
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:56,878
There you go.

514
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,513
Here, Millie.

515
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,015
What's it say?

516
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:15,021
It says, "I want to make love to you. Crash."

517
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,439
Oh, my.

518
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,158
-You see my hips?
-Yep.

519
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,038
And I think Susan Sontag is brilliant.

520
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,542
So is this gonna happen? Us?

521
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,339
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.

522
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,590
Oh.

523
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,385
You had your chance the other day.

524
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,387
What is it that you see in this guy?

525
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,766
I mean, he's a young, wild. . .

526
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,435
dim, pretty boy.

527
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,438
Young men are uncomplicated.

528
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,065
And he's not dim.

529
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,609
He's just inexperienced.

530
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:06,656
It's my job to give him life wisdom
and to help him get on to the major leagues.

531
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,076
Well, that's funny. That's my job too.

532
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,620
Damn!

533
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,375
-You're pulling your hips.
-I know, I know, I know.

534
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,627
But they're nice hips.

535
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,088
-I looked up your records.
-You what?

536
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,424
Mm-hmm.
You hit 227 home runs in the minors.

537
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,176
That's not bad.

538
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,387
-Don't tell anybody.
-Why not?

539
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,473
You hit 20 more this year, you're gonna
be the all-time minor league champ.

540
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,058
The record's 246.

541
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:40,439
Well, 247 home runs in the minor leagues
would be a kind of dubious honor.

542
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,942
I think it would be great.
The Sporting News should know about it.

543
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,444
No. Would you – No. Just, no.

544
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,821
Please.

545
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,657
Okay.

546
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,785
Last chance.

547
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,704
Your place or mine?

548
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,748
Despite my rejection
of most Judeo-Christian ethics,

549
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,251
I am, within the framework
of the baseball season,

550
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,877
monogamous.

551
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,548
-Give me a break.
-It's true.

552
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,341
Stop it.

553
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,470
Geez –

554
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,640
The fact is, you're afraid of meeting
a guy like me 'cause it might be real.

555
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:18,811
So. . . you sabotage it
with some, uh, what is it, bullshit

556
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,397
about commitment to a young boy
you can boss around.

557
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,316
That's a great deal.

558
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,567
Nice.

559
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,652
I know women like you.

560
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,113
I know women like you.

561
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,657
You're a regular patron saint. You know?

562
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:33,993
Stray cats. . .

563
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,080
lost causes, or 6' 3" homeless studs.

564
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,626
Oh, Crash, you do make speeches.

565
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,889
Oh, my!

566
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,393
Oh! Crash, that was fabulous.

567
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,563
Crash?

568
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,776
You mean Nuke. You said Crash.

569
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,737
Hmm? No, honey.

570
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,447
No, I didn't. I said –

571
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,907
I said Nuke.

572
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,077
-You said Crash.
-Oh, no, I didn't.

573
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,412
Listen, sweetheart, you shouldn't listen
to what a woman says

574
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,540
when she's in the throes of passion.

575
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,751
They say the darnedest things.

576
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,586
Yeah. You said Crash.

577
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,384
Honey, would you rather I be
making love to him using your name,

578
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,470
or making love to you using his name?

579
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,972
Huh? Hmm? Hmm?

580
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,225
Hmm? Hmm?

581
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,020
-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-Uh-huh.

582
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:50,361
Welcome to the Eastern Seaboard
Tobacco Growers City Council

583
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,405
Little League Cash Drop Day.

584
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:56,909
These young fellas – young men,
I should say, over here to my left –

585
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,912
Hi, 18. Hi, 12.

586
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,206
Hey, Dino.

587
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,586
Hey, Millie.

588
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,801
Hey. I'm Millie.

589
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,970
I'm married.

590
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,222
He doesn't mean it, Millie.

591
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,015
Yeah. Yeah.

592
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,397
-What is that?
-Chicken bone cross.

593
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,609
Takes the curse off the bat
and brings me hits.

594
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,111
What are you? A goddamn witch?

595
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,613
Yes.

596
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,365
A switch-hitting witch.

597
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,577
Will that work for me?

598
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,579
If you believe in voodoo.

599
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,373
José, I am zero for 16.

600
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,625
A big, fucking doughnut hole for 16.

601
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,211
I can't remember the last time
I had a base hit.

602
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,673
-Come on. Let me have some of that stuff.
-Man, that is not belief.

603
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,800
-That's desperation.
-José!

604
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,927
Come on. Just touch my bat once.

605
00:34:58,597 --> 00:34:59,930
Come on. Just once.

606
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,142
I won't bother you the rest of the day,
I swear to God. Just touch the bat once.

607
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,937
Ladies and gentlemen, five, four,

608
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,649
three, two, one!

609
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,277
Let 'er go!

610
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,030
One thousand big ones!

611
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,250
Come on, Nuke.

612
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:32,004
This batter ain't nothin'. Come on, Nuke.

613
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,093
-Come on, Nuke, nice and easy.
-Okay, Nuke.

614
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,642
Cut it!

615
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:47,937
Time out.

616
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,064
Let's play ball! Come on!

617
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,941
- One down.
- Stay there.

618
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,235
Give me the ball. Give me the ball.

619
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,528
Hey.

620
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,366
Relax, all right?
Don't try to strike everybody out.

621
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,953
Strikeouts are boring.
Besides that, they're fascist.

622
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,789
Throw some ground balls.

623
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,457
- Play ball!
- It's more democratic.

624
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,585
What's this guy know, anyway?

625
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,547
If he's so great, how come he's been
in the minors for ten years?

626
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,757
If he's so hot,
how come Annie wants me instead of him?

627
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:17,800
Oh, hey.

628
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,387
And another thing, Meat.
You don't know shit. All right?

629
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,681
You wanna make it to the show,
you'll listen to me.

630
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,767
Annie only wants you 'cause
she can boss you around. Got it?

631
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,230
So relax. Let's have some fun out here.
This game's fun. Okay?

632
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,316
It's fun, goddamn it.

633
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,736
And don't hold the ball so hard. Okay?
It's an egg.

634
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,989
Hold it like an egg.

635
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,576
All right, let's play ball! Come on!

636
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,619
What does he know about fun?

637
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,621
I'm young. I know about fun.

638
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,249
He's an old man.
He don't know nothin' about fun.

639
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,543
All right, nobody's gone out there.

640
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,506
Why is he calling for a curveball?

641
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,301
I wanna bring heat.

642
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,804
Shake him off. Throw what you want.

643
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,312
Goddamn it. Time out.

644
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,605
Hey!

645
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,524
Why are you shaking me off? Huh?

646
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,694
I want to bring the heater
to announce my presence with authority.

647
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,113
-To announce your what?
-To announce my presence with authority.

648
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,115
You announce your fucking presence
with authority?

649
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,409
This guy is a first-ball fastball hitter.
He's looking for heat.

650
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,912
Oh, yeah? So what? He ain't seen my heat.

651
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,292
All right, Meat. Give him your heat.

652
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:40,007
Why is he always calling me Meat?
I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

653
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,427
Fastball.

654
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,767
Come on, Nuke. Settle down, boy.
Settle down. Take your time.

655
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,323
Home run for Burt Crooks
of the Fayetteville Generals.

656
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,867
What are you doing? Huh?
What are you doing standing here?

657
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,286
I give you a gift,
you stand here, show up my pitcher?

658
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,621
Run, dummy!

659
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,459
Give me the ball.

660
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:21,173
Well, he really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he?

661
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,676
-I held it like an egg.
-Yeah, and he scrambled the son of a bitch.

662
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,096
Look at that. He hit the fuckin' bull.
Guy gets a free steak.

663
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,434
-You having fun yet?
-Oh, yeah, I'm having a blast. Thanks.

664
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,811
Good.

665
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,898
God! Sucker teed off it
like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.

666
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,692
-He did know.
-How?

667
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,111
I told him.

668
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,739
- All right, one down.
- Still got nobody out.

669
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,993
Nuke, you're the man! No batter, no batter!
Chuck hard, kid! You got him, baby!

670
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,869
Don't think. Just throw.

671
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,414
Don't think. Just throw.

672
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,290
Come on! You the man! You the man!

673
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,960
Chuck hard! Chuck hard!
You got him! You got him! You got him!

674
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,755
Throw strikes!

675
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,968
- Stee!
- That-a-way!

676
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,762
God, that was beautiful. What'd I do?

677
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,106
Hang on, Millie. Here we go again.

00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,751
♪ So long, baby, good-bye ♪

684
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,424
That's the first home run
of the year for Crash Davis.

685
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:50,637
That brings the score
up to Fayetteville 14, Durham 2.

686
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,182
Hell of a shot.

687
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,769
Sorry it got wasted.

688
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,939
Jesus. I don't know
what to do with these guys.

689
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,775
I beg, I plead.

690
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,486
I try to be a nice guy.
I'm a nice guy, but I don't –

691
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,905
-Scare 'em.
-Huh?

692
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,698
They're kids. Scare 'em.

693
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,078
That's what I'd do.

694
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,955
Yeah.

695
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,297
Everybody into the shower!

696
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,343
Anybody ain't in this shower in 10 seconds
gonna get fined $100!

697
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,220
-Larry!
-One Mississippi!

698
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,056
Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi.
Four Mississippi.

699
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,058
-Get in there! Hurry it up!
-Five Mississippi. Six Mississippi.

700
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:40,979
Seven Mississippi. Eight Mississippi.
Nine Mississippi. Ten Mississippi.

701
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,523
You guys!

702
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:46,276
You lollygag the ball around the infield.

703
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,737
You lollygag your way down to first!

704
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,407
You lollygag in and out of the dugout.

705
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,327
Do you know what that makes you? Larry.

706
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,287
-Lollygaggers.
-Lollygaggers.

707
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,749
-What's our record, Larry?
-Eight and 16.

708
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,460
Eight and 16.

709
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,213
How did we ever win eight?

710
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,298
-It's a miracle.
-It's a miracle.

711
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,262
This is a simple game.

712
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,973
You throw the ball.

713
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,517
You hit the ball.

714
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,728
You catch the ball.

715
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,022
You got it?

716
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:30,154
Now, we have got a 12-day road trip
starting tomorrow.

717
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,449
Bus leaves 6:00 in the morning.

718
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,870
Goddamn son-of-a-bitchin'
motherfucking shitheads.

719
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,663
Goddamn it!

720
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,210
Yeah, Skipper, you wanted to see me?

721
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,296
Yeah, uh, Bobby.

722
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,755
Shut the door.

723
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,227
This is the toughest job a manager has,

724
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:07,149
but the organization
has decided to make a change.

725
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,359
They're releasing you from your contract.

726
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,071
Skip, I know I'm in a goddamn slump,
but I hit the ball hard today.

727
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,366
A couple of flares drop in for me,
I'm right back in the groove.

728
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,661
Sorry.

729
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,791
Hey.

730
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,965
- Let's go. Come on.
- Nuke?

731
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:33,759
Honey.

732
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,012
Let's go. Come on. We got five hours.
Five-hour drive coming up.

733
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,182
Move your ass and get everything in.
People are on, people are out.

734
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,810
Honey, I want you to wear these
when you're pitching on the road.

735
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,938
-What are they?
-They're garters.

736
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,940
They're gonna hug your waist and snuggle

737
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,275
and kinda dangle off your thighs and buns
in such a wonderful way

738
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,277
that'll help you see things differently.

739
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:56,865
Plus, it'll remind you of me, which is a lot nicer
than thinkin' about all those nasty hitters.

740
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,743
Jesus, Annie, I don't –
I don't know.

741
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,620
You've been pitchin' out
of the wrong side of your brain.

742
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,914
This'll help put things on the right side.

743
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,708
Big-league pitchers don't use these.

744
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,378
They did when they were
in the Carolina League.

745
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,629
Nuke. Nuke.

746
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,798
Excuse me. Time to go to work.

747
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,591
Bye.

748
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,218
Mmm.

749
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,267
Bye, y'all.

750
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,559
-Bye.
-Give me a break.

751
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,272
Bye. Go get 'em, boys.
Hit 'em where they ain't.

Thank you.

760
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,987
-What?
-It's not "woolly."

761
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,239
Nobody gets "woolly."

762
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,450
Women get weary. They don't get woolly.

763
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,536
Nobody's got stress.
They're wearing a dress.

764
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,955
Goddamn, I hate people
that get the words wrong.

765
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,460
How come you don't like me?

766
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,713
'Cause you don't respect yourself,
which is your problem.

767
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,426
But you don't respect the game,
and that's my problem.

768
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,345
You got a gift.

769
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,347
-What do I got?
-You got a gift.

770
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:47,184
When you were a baby, the gods reached down
and turned your right arm into a thunderbolt.

771
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,103
You got a hall-of-fame arm,
but you're pissing it away.

772
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,688
I ain't pissin' nothing away.

773
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:55,275
I got a Porsche already.
I got a 911 with a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

774
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,778
Christ, you don't need
a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

775
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,988
What you need is a curveball. Huh?

776
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,074
In the show, everybody can hit a fastball.

777
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,409
Well, how would you know?

778
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,495
You been in the majors?

779
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,792
Yeah, I've been in the majors.

780
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,044
You were? Yeah? Where were you?

781
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,088
You've been in the show, man?

782
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,465
Yeah, I was in the show.

783
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,135
I was in the show for 21 days once.

784
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,888
Wow.

785
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,933
-The 21 greatest days of my life.
-I'll bet.

786
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:32,020
You never handle your luggage in the show.
Somebody else carries your bags.

787
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:34,064
It was great.

788
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,734
- You hit white balls for batting practice.
- White balls!

789
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:40,821
And the ballparks are like cathedrals.

790
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,783
The hotels all have room service.

791
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,410
Room service?

792
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:49,037
And the women
all have long legs and brains.

793
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,377
-They're really hot, huh?
-Yeah, and so are the pitchers.

794
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,464
They throw ungodly breaking stuff
in the show – exploding sliders.

795
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:06,513
You could be one of those guys.
Nuke could be one of those guys.

796
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,598
But you don't give a fuck, Meat.

797
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,269
Listen, I'm sick and fucking tired
of you calling me Meat.

798
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,065
-You want to step outside?
-Yeah, I'll step outside.

799
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,151
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, Crash!

800
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,319
Man, come on! He was kidding!

801
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:24,364
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Back off, back off!

802
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,951
Come on. What's the problem?
Crash. Crash. Nuke, what's happening, man?

803
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,913
I was just gonna ask Crash
to show me how to throw a breaking ball.

804
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:35,709
Good idea. Good idea. Yeah.
Anybody bring a ball? Let's get a ball.

805
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,539
Double off the wall by Higgins.

806
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:17,792
Once again, the Durham pitchers
are unable to get the first out of the inning.

807
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,025
The Bulls will attempt
to end a six-game losing streak

808
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,195
against the Greensboro Hornets
with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill.

809
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,916
Base hit to center field off LaLoosh.

810
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,675
That closes the book on LaLoosh today.

811
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:11,680
Five earned runs, five hits, five strikeouts,
five walks, and five wild pitches.

812
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,099
It's time to tell it like it is, sports fans.

813
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,519
This is the most wretched road trip
I've seen in 20 years,

814
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,522
and possibly the worst Durham team
in a half century.

815
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,608
Is the modern-day athlete
a pale imitation of the great old warriors?

816
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,777
Only Crash Davis stands out this year.

817
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:30,115
Begging the question, what are these boys
thinking about? 'Cause it sure ain't baseball.

818
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,665
Bench my ass. Bench me.

819
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,167
What's up with that? Ha!

820
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,837
Mr. Originality.

821
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,595
Hey, Mr. Hormone, check out this.

822
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,764
Ice skaters. God, look at 'em.

823
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,058
Hey, fellas, that's what we need, man.

824
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,686
One night with some of these skaters
and we can get back on track.

825
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,770
Yeah, right.

826
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,690
We just need a night off
to end our losing streak.

827
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,775
What we need is a rainout.

828
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,485
I can get us a rainout.

829
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,196
Man, there ain't been
a cloud in the sky in weeks.

830
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,909
Hundred bucks says
I can get us a rainout for tomorrow.

831
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,917
- You got it, man.
- You're on!

832
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,636
I ain't paying for this.
Crash, pay for this.

833
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,929
Shut up.
You're gonna wake everybody up.

834
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,932
Let the bonus baby pay for it.

835
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,353
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesus, man.

836
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,605
-Geez!
-Shit.

837
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,820
- What, man?
- Shh! Quiet. Come here.

838
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,450
Hey, man, I'm 0 for 16.

839
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,745
I'm 0 for June!

840
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,081
Hey, Crash, what are you doing?

841
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,416
Oh, my God.

842
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,176
Oh, my goodness!

843
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,889

-Wake up.
-Huh?

864
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,624
You're awake.

865
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,250
You're okay.

866
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,878
You were dreaming.

867
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,508
You're okay?

868
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,093
I was playing damn near naked.

869
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,095
-What?
-I was naked.

870
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,431
Playing naked.

871
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,185
I know.

872
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,979
I know. I have that dream all the time too.

873
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,233
We're almost home.

874
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,617
All right, watch your head.

875
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,994
-Here you go.
-Let me get that black bag.

876
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,246
-Here.
-I'm not your slave.

877
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,456
-That's not your bag.
-No, that one over there.

878
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,003
Need a ride?

879
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,464
Uh, yeah. You goin' my way?

880
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,633
Hi.

881
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,475

What a trip.

887
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,289
I was lousy.
I mean, I was worse than lousy.

888
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:33,293
Every time I pitched,
it was like throwing gasoline on a fire.

889
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,551
-I mean, I –
-What is all this "I, I, I" stuff?

890
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,013
What about me, huh?
Aren't you glad to see me?

891
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,056
Don't I look nice?

892
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,518
You look great. I'm sorry.

893
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:53,271
-I'm just totally exhausted.
-Well, good.

894
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,357
Physical exhaustion
can be spiritually fabulous.

895
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,777
What you need is a good game of catch.

896
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,238
-Catch?
-Mm-hmm.

897
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,033
Mmm-baby, mmm-baby, come on.
Fire one in here.

898
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,201
This is ridiculous. I'm a professional.

899
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:10,121
Will you just give it a try and lean in?

900
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,250
Thank you.

901
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,296
Now, I want you
to breathe through your eyelids.

902
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,589
-My eyelids?
-Yeah.

903
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,633
Like the lava lizards
of the Galápagos Islands.

904
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:25,428
See, there's some lizards have a parietal eye
behind their heads so they can see backwards.

905
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:30,558
Haven't you ever noticed how Fernando Valenzuela,
he just doesn't even look when he pitches?

906
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:34,687
He's a Mayan Indian. Or an Aztec.
I forget which one. I get 'em confused.

907
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,981
-So do I.
-Stand up for a second.

908
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,400
I want you to be aware
of the chakra connection

909
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,569
-between your feet and your testicles.
-Chakra?

910
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:45,740
Yeah, your right leg and your left testicle,
and your left leg and your right testicle.

911
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,117
-I like that.
-I bet you do.

912
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,370
Give me the ball. Come on.
I'm tired of hearing this.

913
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,039
All right. Fire one in there! Come on.

914
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,416
Okay. . .

915
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,380
You're patronizing me,
and I will not be patronized.

916
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,882
If I throw too hard,
I'm gonna hurt the girl.

917
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:08,721
This girl has handled a lot of pitchers
whose records are a lot better than 1 and 7.

918
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,264
-1 and 6.
-Oh, sorry.

919
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,808
Give me the goddamn ball.

920
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,694
-How do you like that?
-That was much better. Did you see that?

921
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:26,114
Because your delivery was fully integrated
because you weren't thinking about it

922
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,574
'cause you were pissed off at me!
Now that's progress.

923
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,703
Get your butt up here, and let's bend over
and I'm gonna show you –

924
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,329
I give up. I give up.

925
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:35,331
Come on, let's go inside and make love

926
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,668
and fall asleep
until it's time to go to the ballpark.

927
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:44,298
Or. . . we could just take
all that sexual energy and. . .

928
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,510
kinda hold onto it for a few hours

929
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:51,014
and then rechannel it
into your pitching tonight.

930
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,019
You're a powerful young thing,
Ebby Calvin.

931
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,024
You want something for that sore shoulder?

932
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,776
Yeah, I want that shit
that don't smell bad, all right?

933
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:07,238
- Well, it's on back order.
- Give him some of that shit.

934
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,085
-Wha –
-That's hot.

935
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,130
No, I mean it. That's very hot.

936
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,844
Annie says it'll keep one side of my brain
occupied while I'm on the mound,

937
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,055
thus keeping my brain slightly off-center,

938
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:34,682
which is where it should be
for artists and pitchers.

939
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,727
Okay.

940
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,775
She also – She also said that I should throw
whatever pitches you call for.

941
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,236
Annie's a very smart lady.

942
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,699
What?

943
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,205
The rose goes in the front, big guy.

944
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,836
Now batting for the Salem Buffs,

945
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,297
center fielder Joe McCorkle.

946
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,177
This underwear feels kind of sexy.

947
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,806
Don't make me queer, right? Right.

948
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,141
Whoo!

949
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,604
Breaking ball.

950
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,570
-Yeah!
-All right! Good way to start, baby!

951
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,155
Right.

952
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,867
I mean, I ain't queer. No, I ain't.

953
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,457
Fastball.

954
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,546
Stee!

955
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:51,676
Ninety-six miles an hour. He looks good.
But why's he all twistin' up like that?

956
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,595
He's using his parietal eye,
just like Fernando.

957
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,056
Ooh, that was a humdinger.

958
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,684
Come on.

959
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,399
Fastball again? Why's he want the heat?
I just threw heat.

960
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,944
Don't think, Meat. Just give him the gas.

961
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,657
Out!

962
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,036
Geez. What's got into Nuke?

963
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:23,541
He's wearing garters, and he's breathing
out of his eyelids like a lava lizard.

964
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,543
Old, uh, Mayan deal.

965
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,545
-Aztec.
-Aztec deal.

966
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,470
Got it! I got it!

967
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,808
Way to go! Way to go!

968
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,397
-Had my mojo working!
-You nuked 'em!

969
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,107
You know what a mojo is?

970
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,151
-Sure.
-No, you don't.

971
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,445
I was great, huh?

972
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,157
Your fastball's up.
Your curveball's hanging.

973
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,409
In the show, they would've ripped you.

974
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,956
-Can't you even let me enjoy the moment?
-The moment's over.

975
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,794
Y'all, don't forget to try one
of Uncle Fred's yummy red hots while you're here.

976
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,297
This guy starts me off
with a breaking ball. . .

977
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,759
I'm taking him downtown.

978
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,220
He bad. He bad.

979
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:25,102
I dare you to throw me the hammer.
You ain't that stupid.

980
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:28,189
Stepping up to the plate for Durham,
our own Crash Davis.

981
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,567
Come on, put your hands together for Crash.
Let's hear it!

982
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:35,905
Let's go.

983
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,867
Come on, Meat.
Bring me that weak-ass shit, huh?

984
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,870
Bring it. Bring it. Bring it.

985
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,001
Oh, my.

986
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,924
Whoo!

987
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,180
2-nothing Bulls in the second.
First time the Bulls have been ahead in weeks.

988
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:02,807
-Eh, Whitey?
-Mm-hmm.

989
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,976
Let's see
if the real Nuke LaLoosh will show up.

990
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,395
Bulls! Bulls!

991
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,408
Back! Back, back, back, back!

992
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,660
-Room! You got room!
-Back!

993
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,453
You got room!

994
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,455
Out!

995
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,463
What are you doing out here?
I'm cruising, man.

996
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,174
I want you to throw the next one
at the mascot.

997
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,385
Why? I'm finally throwing it
where I want to throw it.

998
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,470
Just throw it at the bull, all right?

999
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,139
Trust me.

1000
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,560
He's the boss.

1001
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:57,778
A staggering start by LaLoosh. He's thrown
five outs on nine pitches, all of 'em strikes.

1002
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:01,824
He's got pinpoint control here tonight,
Bull fans. Here's the pitch.

1003
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,170
-This guy's crazy.
-Yep.

1004
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:18,007
I wouldn't dig in there if I was you.
Next one might be at your head.

1005
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,427
I don't know where it's gonna go.

1006
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,220
I swear to God.

1007
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,780
You're the man, Nuke. You're the man.

1008
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,490
Easy game. Easy game.

1009
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,619
Top of the ninth, two outs.

1010
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,789
One out away from a stunning
two-hit shutout for LaLoosh.

1011
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,709
Bear down, Meat. Don't let up.

1012
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,087
You own these guys.

1013
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,673
Dad would love a shutout.

1014
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,222
Oh, no, no, no. No.

1015
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:11,060
No, no. He's looking for heat.

1016
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,895
Let me give him the deuce.

1017
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,314
Play ball!

1018
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:20,194
Oh, no, he's shaking off the signs.
Big mistake.

1019
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,823
This son of a bitch is throwing
a two-hit shutout, he's shaking me off.

1020
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,366
You believe that shit?

1021
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,413
Charlie, here comes the deuce.

1022
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:33,040
And when you speak of me, speak well.

1023
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,173
-No, no, serve it up.
-Yeah.

1024
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:52,435
Home run, Jimmy Powell.

1025
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,854
Give me the ball.

1026
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,612
You told him I was gonna
throw a deuce, right?

1027
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,114
Yep.

1028
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,701
Man, that ball got out of here in a hurry.

1029
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:14,457
Anything that travels that far ought to have
a damn stewardess on it, don't you think?

1030
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,669
Let's go!

1031
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,693
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1032
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,325
Yeah!

1033
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:55,122
When Nuke started listening
to Crash, everything fell into place.

1034
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:58,417
He started throwing strikes,
and we started to win.

1035
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,753
But Nuke was still confused.

1036
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:05,716
He was so encouraged by his victory
that he vowed not to have sex until he lost.

1037
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,970
Unfortunately, however, he kept on winning,
and for one extraordinary June and July,

1038
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:15,726
the Durham Bulls began playing baseball
with joy and verve and poetry.

1039
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:20,397
The two sides of my own brain
were all jumbled up and cross-wired.

1040
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,358
While one side was being neglected,

1041
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:26,153
the other was in paradise
watching our Bulls play like big-leaguers.

1042
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:30,115
We swept a four-game series at Kinston,
two games at Winston-Salem,

1043
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,744
and kicked the holy shit out of Greensboro
in a three-game set.

1044
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,915
And Crash, who kept hitting dingers,
was approaching the minor league record,

1045
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,084
though I told nobody.

1046
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:46,507
After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader,
the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

1047
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,803
Beautiful as the winning streak was,
I was gettin' damn lonely.

1048
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,180
Something had to be done.

1049
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,099
I needed a man.

1050
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,059
Yeah!

1051
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,522
-Nuke!
-Hey, Jimmy, how you doin'?

1052
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,069
Yeah! I love winning, man.

1053
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,655
I fuckin' love winning.

1054
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,282
You hear what I'm saying?

1055
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,409
It's, like, better than losing?

1056
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,371
Teach me something new, man.
I need to learn.

1057
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,373
Teach me something.

1058
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,752
You got something to write with?
Good. It's time to work on your interviews.

1059
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,005
My interviews? What do I gotta do?

1060
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,173
You're gonna have to learn your clichés.

1061
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,760
You're gonna have to study them.
You're gonna have to know them.

1062
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,763
They're your friends. Write this down.

1063
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,392
"We got to play 'em one day at a time."

1064
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:42,271
". . . got to play. . . "
That's pretty boring, you know.

1065
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,773
Of course it's boring. That's the point.
Write it down.

1066
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:48,152
". . . one day at a time."

1067
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,113
All right. "I'm just happy to be here.

1068
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,866
Hope I can help the ball club."

1069
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,744
I know. Write it down.

1070
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:01,582
"I just want to give it my best shot,

1071
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,836
and the good Lord willing,
things will work out."

1072
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,299
". . . good Lord willing,

1073
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,052
-things will work out."
-"Things will work out." Yep.

1074
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,637
How's Annie?

1075
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,601
She's getting pretty steamed actually

1076
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,896
'cause I'm still rechanneling
my sexual energy.

1077
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,069
I'm figuring I'm just gonna cave in
and sleep with her, you know,

1078
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,695
to calm her down.

1079
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,239
-Are you out of your mind?
-I'm just –

1080
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,492
-Are you out of your mind?
-Just talking about one time.

1081
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,995
If you give in now,
you might start losing. Huh?

1082
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:47,002
Never fuck with a winning streak.

1083
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,593
Hi, boys.

1084
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,805
Hi, darlin'. Get in here, you sweet thing.

1085
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,598
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Hey, Millie.

1086
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,475
Want a ride?

1087
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:06,063
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

1088
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,357
No.

1089
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,901
Can I give you my testimony?

1090
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:14,238
You can do anything you want.

1091
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,452
Hop in.

1092
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,917
I am so proud of you guys.

1093
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,092
-You want some more soup, honey?
-Oh, no, thanks. That was good.

1094
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,433
How about a little, um, back rub?

1095
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:46,186
No, I'm-I'm okay.
I think I'm gonna just take a little nap.

1096
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,191
-You want me to tuck you in?
-Annie. Annie, you can't seduce me.

1097
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:55,571
Sweetie,
I'm not gonna try to seduce you.

1098
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,118
-What's that?
-That's my leg.

1099
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,786
I know what it is.

1100
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:05,456
I just thought maybe we could
work on some fundamentals,

1101
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,543
since we're not gonna make love, and kind of. . .
improve your hand-eye coordination.

1102
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:13,422
- My hand-eye coordination?
- Mm-hmm. Unsnap my stocking.

1103
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:19,178
The other day, Crash called a woman's pu –

1104
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,096
pussy, um. . .

1105
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,600
Well, you know how the hair
is kind of in a "V" shape?

1106
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,271
-Yes, I do.
-Well, he called it the Bermuda Triangle.

1107
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,566
He said that a man can get lost in there
and never be heard from again.

1108
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,069
-What a nasty thing to say.
-Oh, no, no. He didn't mean it nasty.

1109
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:41,992
He – He said that getting lost
and disappearing from the face of the earth

1110
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:45,996
was sometimes a good thing to do,
especially like that.

1111
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,417
But he also said that there are times
for discipline,

1112
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:53,962
and-and self-control,
and I think this is one of those times.

1113
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,507
Well, Crash is a very smart man.

1114
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,510
Now, honey, let's give it a try.

1115
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,725
Here, wait a minute. Watch. Watch.

1116
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,608
Now you try it. Go ahead.

1117
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,449
Mm-hmm.

1118
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,036
Yep.

1119
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,790
Mmm. Yeah. That's it.

1120
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,169
-You're playing with my mind.
-I'm trying to play with your body.

1121
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,798
-I knew it. You're trying to seduce me.
-Of course I'm trying to seduce you, for God's sake.

1122
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,467
I'm doing a damn poor job of it.
Aren't I pretty?

1123
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:44,346
-Oh, God, I think you're real cute.
-Cute?

1124
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,391
Baby ducks are cute. I hate cute!

1125
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:50,561
I want to be exotic and mysterious.

1126
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:54,481
You are.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute and –

1127
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,734
That's why I'd better leave.

1128
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,736
Nuke, you got it all wrong!

1129
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,365
There's no relationship
between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.

1130
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,701
-I did.
-And what did he say?

1131
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,287
He said if I give in to you,
I'll start losing again.

1132
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,248
-He did?
-Yeah.

1133
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,501
I'll be back when we lose.

1134
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,050
Damn it.

1135
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,275
How dare you tell Nuke
to stay out of my bed!

1136
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,028
You are messing with my private life!

1137
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,614
Knock, knock. You know? "Come in."

1138
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,574
-You're confusing him.
-Where's "Thank you"?

1139
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,910
-You're bending his mind all out of shape.
-I'm what?

1140
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,495
-You're confusing him.
-I'm confusing him?

1141
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,873
You got him breathing
out of the wrong goddamn eyelid.

1142
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,167
You got him parading around
the locker room like a fruit.

1143
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,254
That is a religious ritual, and it happens
to be working, if you don't mind my saying.

1144
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,798
Wait a second. Who dresses you?

1145
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,342
-What?
-Who dresses you?

1146
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,470
Don't you think this is a little excessive
for the Carolina League?

1147
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:10,474
"The road of excess leads
to the palace of wisdom." William Blake.

1148
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,225
-William Blake?
-William Blake.

1149
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,436
-William Blake?
-William Blake!

1150
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,105
-What do you mean, William Blake?
-I mean William Blake!

1151
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:23,236
Who are you? I mean, do you have a job?

1152
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:26,531
I teach part-time
at Alamance Junior College.

1153
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,284
English 101 and Beginning Composition!

1154
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:33,288
You know,
having a conversation with you is like –

1155
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,917
-is like a Martian talking to a fungo.
-Oh, cute.

1156
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:40,504
Just because sometimes you manage
to be clever and you have a nice smile

1157
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:42,464
does not mean you are not full of shit.

1158
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,508
-What, I'm full of shit?
-You're full of shit.

1159
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:47,177
-You are full of shit!
-Nuke's chastity was your idea.

1160
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,887
I know. I'm telling you –

1161
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:52,349
-I never told him to stay out of your bed.
-Yes, you did. You most certainly did.

1162
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,434
-I never told him to stay out of your bed.
-Yes, you did.

1163
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,021
I told him that a player on a streak
has to respect the streak.

1164
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,314
-Fine.
-You know why?

1165
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,316
-'Cause they don't happen very often.
-Right.

1166
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,860
If you believe you're playing well
because you're getting laid

1167
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:07,322
or because you're not getting laid
or because you wear women's underwear,

1168
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,949
then you are!

1169
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,575
And you should know that.

1170
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,458
Come on, Annie.
Think of something clever to say, huh?

1171
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,339
Something full of magic
and religion bullshit.

1172
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,551
Come on, dazzle me.

1173
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,555
I want you.

1174
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,765
What?

1175
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,977
-I said I want you.
-Stop it.

1176
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,901
You're scared.

1177
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,533
Maybe I am.

1178
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,911
But I still think you should leave.

1179
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,916
Okay, well,

1180
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:03,086
this is the damnedest season
I've ever seen.

1181
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,548
I mean, the Durham Bulls can't lose,
and I can't get laid!

1182
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,428
Damn!

1183
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,765
Come on, Nuke!
Show 'em what you got. Super rook!

1184
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,726
Show 'em your super rook!
Super Nuke! Super Nuke!

1185
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,229
LaLoosh! LA Loosh!
Come on, LaLoosh! LA Loosh! LA Loosh!

1186
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:25,150
Just relax out there. Don't aim the ball.

1187
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:26,985
Damn.

1188
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,364
Nuke's overthrowing tonight.
Don't look loose.

1189
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,366
Anything bothering him?

1190
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:37,913
He says his chakras are jammed. He's having
trouble breathing out of his, uh, left eyelid?

1191
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,456
-Right eyelid.
-Right eyelid.

1192
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,546
Jack, give me the ball.

1193
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,090
Fuck!

1194
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,429
- Time out!
- Up to the plate, Junior Shockley.

1195
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,014
What's wrong?

1196
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,225
I'm a little nervous. My old man's here.

1197
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,644
Your dad's here? Where's he at?

1198
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,189
He's right behind home plate.
Don't look. Don't look. Shit.

1199
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,943
Look, he's waving.

1200
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,821
Hey, he's just your old man.
He's as full of shit as anybody.

1201
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,615
-Hey, what's going on?
-Breathing through the wrong fuckin' eyelid again?

1202
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,326
-Shut up.
-Did you guys hear about Jimmy and Millie?

1203
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,538
-Yep.
-They got engaged! Can you believe that?

1204
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,707
Oh, yeah? Wait till I tell him
she's gone down on half the Carolina League.

1205
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,002
Hey, anybody says anything bad about Millie,
I break his neck.

1206
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,004
Excuse me, guys,
I got a game to pitch here.

1207
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:31,550
José.

1208
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,178
Hey, you guys. Don't throw me anything.
My girlfriend put a curse on my glove.

1209
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:37,597
I'll take the hex off the fuckin' glove.
Give me the glove.

1210
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,516
You gotta cut the head off a live rooster.

1211
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,395
Come on! Play ball!

1212
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,897
What the hell's going on out there?

1213
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,692
Looks like a convention.
Pretty soon they ought to call the roll.

1214
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,488
-Get your ass out there and check it out.
-You bet.

1215
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,078
- Let's play some baseball!
- Hurry up!

1216
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,999
Excuse me.
What the hell's going on out here?

1217
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:09,171
Well, Nuke's scared 'cause
his eyelids are jammed and his old man's here.

1218
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,673
We need a live – Was it a live rooster?

1219
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,301
We need a live rooster
to take the curse off José's glove.

1220
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:18,471
And nobody seems to know what to get
Millie or Jimmy for their wedding present.

1221
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,890
-That about right?
-That's right.

1222
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,474
We're dealing with a lot of shit.

1223
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,604
Okay, well, uh,
candlesticks always make a nice gift,

1224
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,939
and maybe you could find out
where she's registered.

1225
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,692
Maybe a place setting
or maybe a silverware pattern's good.

1226
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,861
Okay, let's get two. Here we go.

1227
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,121
LaLoosh looks in for the sign. Here's the pitch.

1228
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,999
Ball hit deep into right field,
off the wall.

1229
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:49,461
-You should be at the game, Annie.
-Mm-mmm. I'm fine.

1230
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,465
Beautiful night for baseball here in Durham,
and as the batter steps in –

1231
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:59,971
How much time did you and Jimmy
spend together before he proposed?

1232
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,265
About five hours, I guess.

1233
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,809
-We both just knew.
-Hmm.

1234
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,270
Annie. . .

1235
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,565
do you think I deserve to wear white?

1236
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,778
-Honey, we all deserve to wear white.
-Ball 2, in the dirt.

1237
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,613
Come on, Nuke! Go get him!

1238
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,784
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

1239
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,494
Right! Right! Right!

1240
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,287
Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

1241
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,372
Come on!

1242
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:28,959
He's gonna go home! Home! Home!
We got him! Got him!

1243
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,254
-Safe!
-No! No! I got him!

1244
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,090
-You missed him. You missed him.
-No, I got him! I didn't miss him!

1245
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:39,261
-Jesus, Jack, he still hasn't touched the plate!
-Don't bump me! Don't bump me!

1246
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,554
He still ain't touched the plate!

1247
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,556
Ah, fuck it.

1248
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,433
It was a cocksucking call.

1249
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:49,104
-Did you call me a cocksucker?
-No, I said it was a cocksucking call!

1250
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,482
-You can't throw me for that!
-You missed the tag!

1251
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,485
-You just spit on me! You spit on me!
-I did not spit on you! I did not!

1252
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:58,571
You're in the wrong business, Jack.
You're Sears and Roebuck material.

1253
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,408
You're pushin' it, buddy.
You want me to run you? I'll run you.

1254
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:04,411
-You want me to call you a cocksucker?
-Go ahead, try it! Try it!

1255
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,539
-Call me a cocksucker!
-"Pretty please." Beg me.

1256
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,916
Call me a cocksucker
and you're out of here!

1257
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:13,044
-You're a cocksucker. You're a cocksucker!
-You're out of here!

1258
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,839
-Shit!
-What the fuck is that?

1259
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,215
Holy shit!

1260
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:24,222
-He called me a cocksucker!
-No way!

1261
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:28,935
I've never seen Crash so angry,
and frankly, sports fans,

1262
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,105
he used a certain word
that's a no-no with umpires.

1263
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,526
Crash must have
called the guy a cocksucker.

1264
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,863
Mmm! God, he's so romantic.

1265
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:45,368
When Crash got thrown out,
the game got out of hand.

1266
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,039
José made three errors
with his cursed mitt.

1267
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:53,209
Nuke never quite got in the groove,
though he didn't pitch bad.

1268
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:56,755
And the winning streak came to an end
with a 3-2 loss.

1269
01:17:57,256 --> 01:18:00,759
The good news was
that a man was about to come calling.

1270
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,845
The bad news was. . . it was the wrong guy.

Oh, Annie, I'd like you to meet my father.

1285
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:11,287
-Oh, my!
-Ebby's told me a lot about you.

1286
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:15,583
Yeah, Ebby tells me you've taught him
a lot about discipline and self-control.

1287
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,294
We were worried that
he might get involved in the wrong crowd.

1288
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,547
We're so pleased he met a Christian woman.

1289
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,007
-Praise the Lord, eh?
-Praise the Lord.

1290
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,677
Excuse me.

1291
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,137
Excuse me, Dad.

1292
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,225
-Hello? Ooh! What?
-Shh!

1293
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,480
-We got a lot of catching up to do.
-But your father is right there.

1294
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:40,817
Crash tells me I gotta quit worrying about him,
so I think it's a good opportunity.

1295
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,361
-Let's go for a quickie right now.
-We gotta talk.

1296
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:49,284
Hello? Uh-huh.
Yes. He most certainly is here.

1297
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,661
Yeah. It's Skip for you.

1298
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:54,330
Hey, Skip. It's me.

1299
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,545
What?

1300
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,257
Oh, my God.

1301
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,969
Oh, my – Oh, okay.

1302
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,222
Yeah. All right.

1303
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,640
What?

1304
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,143
I'm going to the show.

1305
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,354
Oh!

1306
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,776
Dad! Dad,
they're sending me up to the majors.

1307
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:27,030
I leave first thing in the morning.
Can you believe it?

1308
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,785
- Let's have a word of prayer.
- Oh, let's not.

1309
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,539
-I gotta find Crash. Come on, Dad, I'll dump you off.
-Wait.

1310
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,044
Not so fast. He'll be right with you.

1311
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:44,130
Come on, sweetie,
I just want to have you alone for a second

1312
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,716
so we can say good-bye.

1313
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,593
Oh, I'll be back.

1314
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,179
When somebody leaves Durham,
they don't come back.

1315
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,014
No, I mean later.

1316
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,269
Oh.

1317
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,443
Uh. . .

1318
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,282
Well, God. Annie, geez.

1319
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,495
What do you have in there?

1320
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,914
Uh, nothin'.

1321
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,625
You're not gonna be needing these anymore.

1322
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,711
-I better take them.
-No. You're ready.

1323
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,339
Do you think so?
Do you think I'm ready for this?

1324
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,926
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

1325
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:35,139
Don't think too much.

1326
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,936
I won't.

1327
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,607
You know something, Annie?

1328
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,736
You can't breathe through your eyelids.

1329
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:54,576
Well, of course you can't breathe through your eyelids.
Whoever told you such a ridiculous thing?

1330
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,009
Now, get. Come on.

1331
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,639
Drive careful.

1332
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,060
Oh, my.

1333
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,871
Hey, hey. There you are.

1334
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,247
Crash.

1335
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,292
Hey, Crash.

1336
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,336
Guess what.

1337
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,172
Guess what, man.

1338
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,592
I'm going to the show.

1339
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,846
The big club's expanding its roster
to finish out the season –

1340
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,264
Nice shot!

1341
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,725
And I am going to the show.

1342
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,394
So why don't you go then?

1343
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:05,605
Well, let's celebrate!

1344
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,816
Congratulations.

1345
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,155
Hope you end up on the cover
of Sports Illustrated. Maybe a cereal box.

1346
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:19,285
What's your problem, man?
I'm trying to thank you.

1347
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:22,288
-Let's get out of this dump. I'll buy you a beer.
-Hey!

1348
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:24,749
-You calling my place a dump?
-No, he's not.

1349
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,501
-Huh?
-No, he's not.

1350
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,128
-He's not. Are you?
-No.

1351
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:31,172
He's not. All right?

1352
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,133
Nuke, you know who this is?

1353
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,469
This is Sandy Grimes.

1354
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:41,557
-Sandy Grimes hit .371 in Louisville in 1965.
-.376.

1355
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,228
I'm sorry. He hit .376.

1356
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,438
That's a career, man.

1357
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,609
-In any league.
-You got that right.

1358
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,444
Did you hear what I said?

1359
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,530
I mean, I'm going to the show.

1360
01:23:56,615 --> 01:24:00,743
Do you know what the difference
between hitting .250 and .300 is?

1361
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,829
It's 25 hits.

1362
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,792
Twenty-five hits in 500 at bats
is 50 points, okay?

1363
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:11,045
There's six months in a season.
That's about 25 weeks.

1364
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:14,424
That means if you get
just one extra flare a week, just one,

1365
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:19,137
a gork, you get a ground ball,
you get a – you get a ground ball with eyes,

1366
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,389
you get a dying quail. . .

1367
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,393
just one more dying quail a week,

1368
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,478
and you're in Yankee Stadium.

1369
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,774
You still – Y-You still don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

1370
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:33,693
Get the hell out of here.

1371
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,278
All right.

1372
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:37,697
Fuck.

1373
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:40,742
-I'll send you a postcard.
-Send me a postcard?

1374
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:43,453
-Hey, I made it.
-You made it? You made shit.

1375
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:45,496
Hey. Hey!

1376
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,042
You crazy?

1377
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,545
-Hey, man, what the hell's wrong with you?
-I'll be all right.

1378
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,797
No, I'm not talkin' about –
I'm talkin' about my mirror.

1379
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:57,592
Shit, I'm sorry. All right?

1380
01:24:57,676 --> 01:25:00,094
-Hey!
-I'm not gonna fight you, man.

1381
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:02,555
What do you mean,
you're not gonna fight me, you fuck?

1382
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,307
-What the fuck? Why am I a fuck?
-Why are you a fuck?

1383
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,350
-Why am I a fuck?
-'Cause you got talent.

1384
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,187
I got brains, but you got talent.

1385
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,900
See this right arm?
It's worth a million bucks a year.

1386
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,235
All my limbs put together
aren't worth seven cents a pound.

1387
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,446
What are you talkin' about?
You're a great catcher.

1388
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,824
I'm a great catcher?
I'm a great catcher?

1389
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:23,367
-Forget it. Forget it.
-Hey!

1390
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,661
-Just fucking forget it.
-Hey, Meat.

1391
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,542
Damn!

1392
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,295
I didn't mean to hit you, man.

1393
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,090
You-You hurt my eye.

1394
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,177
-Ow.
-Sorry.

1395
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:45,556
Well, did you hit me with your right hand
or did you hit me with your left?

1396
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:50,394
Huh? Did you hit me with your right hand
or with your left?

1397
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,855
-My left.
-Good. That's good.

1398
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:57,026
When you get in a fight with a drunk,
you don't hit him with your pitching hand.

1399
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,780
God, I can't keep giving you
these free lessons.

1400
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,115
So quit screwing around and help me up.

1401
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:11,916
You look great, man.

1402
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:25,012
Be careful with the bags.

1403
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,598
We got a boy going to the show.

1404
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,422
Sorry about last night.

1405
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,927
Forget it.

1406
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:12,685
I have been known on occasion to. . .
howl at the moon.

1407
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,063
You understand?

1408
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:19,901
Um. . .

1409
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,570
no.

1410
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,780
Well, you will.

1411
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:28,534
Look, Nuke,

1412
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:34,206
these big-league hitters are gonna light you up
like a pinball machine for a while, all right?

1413
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,709
Don't worry about it.

1414
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:40,504
You be cocky and arrogant,
even when you're getting beat.

1415
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,883
That's the secret.

1416
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:50,056
You got to play this game
with fear and arrogance.

1417
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:53,643
Fear and ignorance.

1418
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:59,315
No. Fear and arrogance,
you hayseed, not ignorance.

1419
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,067
I know, I know.

1420
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:04,695
I just like seeing you get all worked up.

1421
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:12,578
Listen, uh. . .

1422
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,834
Thanks. For everything.

1423
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:35,768
Hey, Nuke?

1424
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:39,981
Good luck.

1425
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,941
You too. . .

1426
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:44,110
Meat.

1427
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:06,007
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1428
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,466
You may kiss the bride.

1429
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,126
Jimmy!

1430
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:46,380
Jimmy, we all pitched in, man,
and we got you a little gift. Tony?

1431
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:48,924
It's kind of a special wedding cake
from the Durham Bulls.

1432
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,263
Oh, my Lord.

1433
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,645
Yeah, Skip?

1434
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:04,690
You wanted to see me?

1435
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:08,152
Crash, shut the door.

1436
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,134
This is the toughest job a manager has. . .

1437
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,098
but. . .

1438
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,394
the organization wants to make a change.

1439
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:48,442
Now that Nuke's gone,
they want to bring up some young catcher.

1440
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,986
Some kid hitting .300 up in Bluefield.

1441
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:52,863
Kid's probably a bust.

1442
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,575
I put in a word for you
with the organization.

1443
01:30:56,993 --> 01:31:01,497
I told them I thought you might make
a fine minor-league manager someday.

1444
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:08,420
There might be an opening
at Visalia next year.

1445
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,551
You had a hell of a year, Crash.

1446
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,303
But. . .

1447
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,348
you know how it is.

1448
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,600
I got released.

1449
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,353
I heard already.

1450
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,764
Oh, my.

1451
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:07,993
I think probably with my love of four-legged
creatures and hooves and everything,

1452
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:11,038
that in another lifetime,
I was probably Catherine the Great.

1453
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:13,874
Or Francis of Assisi.
I'm not sure which one.

1454
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,127
What do you think, honey?

1455
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:23,634
How come in former lifetimes
everybody's somebody famous?

1456
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,766
I mean. . .

1457
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:36,563
How come nobody ever says
they were Joe Schmo?

1458
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:39,441
Because it doesn't work that way,
you fool!

1459
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:50,369
God, you are gorgeous.

1460
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:54,706
You wanna dance?

1461
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,473
Yes.

1462
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,600

Crash took off at dawn.

1489
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,051
Said he heard there might be an opening
for a catcher in Asheville

1490
01:38:53,136 --> 01:38:55,178
in the South Atlantic League.

1491
01:38:55,972 --> 01:39:00,517
A woman should be so strong and powerful
that she's not affected by such things.

1492
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:05,063
I mean, it wasn't the first time I went to bed
with a guy and woke up with a note.

1493
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:08,483
At least the son of a bitch
left me breakfast.

1494
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,823
You have to respect the ballplayer
who's just trying to finish the season.

1495
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:17,409
Least, that's what I told myself.

1496
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:21,622
Baseball may be a religion
full of magic, cosmic truth,

1497
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:25,000
and the fundamental ontological riddles
of our time,

1498
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:27,127
but it's also a job.

1499
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:32,341
Come on, Meat.
Throw me that weak-ass shit.

1500
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:35,636
Come on. Ain't gettin' that cheese by me.

1501
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,971
Bring it. Bring it.

1502
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,181
Bring it.

1503
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:45,604
When Crash hit his 247th home run,
I knew the moment it happened,

1504
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:47,939
but I'm sure nobody else did,

1505
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,901
and The Sporting News
didn't say anything about it.

1506
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:55,947
"Full many a flower's born to blush unseen

1507
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,700
and waste its sweetness
on the desert air."

1508
01:39:58,785 --> 01:40:00,494
Thomas Gray.

1509
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:04,581
Or William Cullen Bryant.
I don't know. I get 'em mixed up.

1510
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:08,543
Anyway, my attempts at housekeeping
were feeble as usual.

1511
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:11,213
I sometimes get easily distracted.

1512
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:14,966
Funny thing was,
I stopped worrying about Nuke.

1513
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:17,761
Somehow I knew nothing would stop him.

1514
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:21,723
The world is made for people
who aren't cursed with self-awareness.

1515
01:40:22,058 --> 01:40:25,102
Crash was right. Nuke had a gift.

1516
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:28,563
I'm just happy to be here,
and I hope I can help the ball club.

1517
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:33,360
I just want to give it my best shot,
and good Lord willing, things will work out.

1518
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,696
You got to play 'em
one day at a time though.

1519
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,823
Raye Anne, right? That's a beautiful name.

1520
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,616
Is that Greek? Raye Anne?

1521
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:41,201
It's a beautiful name though.

1522
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:43,704
There's a great song by Mötley Crüe.
Do you know it?

1523
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:45,539
♪ Raye Anne, she's a-stayin' ♪

1524
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:48,417
No? Anyway,
a good friend of mine used to say,

1525
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:50,168
"This is a very simple game.

1526
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:53,004
You throw the ball.
You catch the ball. You hit the ball.

1527
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:56,299
Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose.

1528
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:59,052
Sometimes it rains."

1529
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:01,054
Think about that for a while.

1530
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:35,607
What happened?

1531
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,652
I quit.

1532
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:43,031
Hit my dinger and I hung 'em up.

1533
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:51,623
I'm quitting too.

1534
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:54,543
I mean boys, not baseball.

1535
01:42:56,796 --> 01:43:00,674
You know, there might be an opening
for a manager in Visalia next spring.

1536
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:08,431
Think I could make it
to the show as a manager?

1537
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:12,018
You'd be great.

1538
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:16,356
You'd be great.

1539
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:21,862
I mean, because you understand
about nonlinear thinking and –

1540
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:25,782
I mean, baseball seems like a linear game
with all those lines and the box scores and all –

1541
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:29,035
-Annie.
-But the fact is, it's a spacious non-time –

1542
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,537
Annie.

1543
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:32,581
What?

1544
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,917
I got a lot of time to hear your theories,

1545
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,004
and I want to hear
every damn one of 'em, but. . .

1546
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,718
now I'm tired, and I just –
I don't want to think about baseball

1547
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,137
and I don't want to think
about quantum physics

1548
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:50,098
and I don't want to think about nothing.
I just –

1549
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:55,854
I just want to be.

1550
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:00,275
I can do that too.

1551
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:04,571
Walt Whitman once said,

1552
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:06,907
"I see great things in baseball.

1553
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:10,076
It's our game, the American game.

1554
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:13,747
It will repair our losses
and be a blessing to us."

1555
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,207
