1
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,422
I believe in the Church of Baseball.

2
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,925
I've tried all the major religions
and most of the minor ones.

3
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,345
I've worshipped Buddha,
Allah, Brahma, Vishnu,

4
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,807
Siva, trees, mushrooms
and Isadora Duncan.

5
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,934
I know things.

6
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,188
For instance, there are 108 beads
in a Catholic rosary

7
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,357
and there are 108 stitches in a baseball.

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,902
When I learned that,
I gave Jesus a chance.

9
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:56,866
But it just didn't work out between us.
The Lord laid too much guilt on me.

10
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,286
I prefer metaphysics to theology.

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,413
You see, there's no guilt in baseball

12
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,250
and it's never boring,
which makes it like sex.

13
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,378
There's never been a ballplayer
who slept with me

14
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,964
who didn't have
the best year of his career.

15
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,593
Making love is like hitting a baseball,

16
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,012
you just gotta relax and concentrate.

17
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,308
Besides, I'd never sleep
with a player hitting under .250

18
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,395
unless he had a lot of RBI's or was
a great glove man up the middle.

19
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,819
You see, there's a certain amount
of life wisdom I give these boys.

20
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,154
I can expand their minds.

21
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,156
Sometimes when I've got
a ballplayer alone

22
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,535
I'll just read Emily Dickinson
or Walt Whitman to him.

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,038
And the guys are so sweet,
they always stay and listen.

24
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,792
Of course, a guy will listen
to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

25
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,630
I make them feel confident,
and they make me feel safe

26
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,757
and pretty.

27
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,261
Of course, what I give them
lasts a lifetime.

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,514
What they give me lasts 142 games.

29
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,642
Sometimes it seems like a bad trade,

30
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,936
but bad trades are part of baseball.

31
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:11,148
Who can forget Frank Robinson
for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,402
It's a long season, and you gotta trust it.

33
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,279
I've tried them all, I really have.

34
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,031
And the only church
that truly feeds the soul

35
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,660
day in, day out, is the Church of Baseball.

36
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,532
Hey, Skip, that Max, hell of a guy.

37
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,160
Where's Ebby?

38
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,120
Ain't he warming up yet?

39
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,707
No. His professional debut tonight,
and he forgets about it.

40
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,043
Better find our "bonus baby."

41
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,796
- Have you seen Ebby?
- No.

42
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,181
Ebby!

43
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,144
Jesus.

44
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,606
Game starts in four minutes.
Why ain't you warm?

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,732
I am warm.

46
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,902
Jesus, Ebby, this is your
professional debut tonight.

47
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,030
Million guys give their left nut
to be in your shoes.

48
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,200
You're leaving your fastball in
the locker room for some piece of ass.

49
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,369
Skip, it is me.

50
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,539
I am not some, quote,
"piece of ass," unquote.

51
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,042
Oh, Millie.

52
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,253
Jeez, sorry. Didn't recognize you.

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,800
Don't take this personal, Millie,
but if I catch you in here again

54
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,426
you're banned from the ballpark.

55
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,639
You can't ban me from the ballpark
'cause my daddy donated that scoreboard.

56
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,934
And if you ban me,
he just might take that scoreboard away.

57
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,311
What do we need a scoreboard for?

58
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,563
We ain't scored any runs all year.

59
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,024
Now you get your ass out there!

60
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,901
Hey, boss, I got a question.

61
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,444
What?

62
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,780
You think I need a nickname?
I think I need a nickname.

63
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,157
We were talking about it.
All the great ones have nicknames.

64
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,535
Like "Oil Can," "Catfish."
What was the one you were...

65
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,744
"Pokey."

66
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,579
What do you think of "Pokey"?

67
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,249
You got three minutes.

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,210
Goddamn, son of a bitching,
motherfucking shithead!

69
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,254
Time for another quickie.

70
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,007
Jesus, you got a game to pitch.

71
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,134
We got three minutes.

72
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,606
Come on, folks.
Let's hear it for Max Patkin,

73
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,775
the clown prince of baseball.

74
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,902
You gonna sit there all day?

75
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,113
And now, "The Greatest Show on Dirt,"

76
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,158
your own Durham Bulls!

77
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,124
I'm there. I'm ready.

78
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,505
And now WRDU radio presents

79
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,091
the voice of the Durham Bulls,
Teddy Garland.

80
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,927
The Bulls off to a slow start,
having dropped their first three games.

81
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,722
But hope to turn it around tonight
with the professional debut

82
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,642
of heralded young pitcher,
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

83
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,481
Millie, you gotta stay
out of the clubhouse.

84
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,899
You're gonna get everybody in trouble.

85
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,817
I got lured.

86
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,320
You did not get lured.
Women do not get lured.

87
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,530
They are too strong and powerful for that.
Now say it,

88
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,575
"I did not get lured. I accept full
responsibility for my actions."

89
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,870
"I did not get lured. I accept full
responsibility for my actions."

90
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,707
That's better. Okay. Now...
You got your radar ready?

91
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,667
- Ready.
- Go to it.

92
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,090
Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox
is leadoff hitter Willie Foster.

93
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,258
Word on LaLoosh is that
the good-looking, young pitcher

94
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,096
has a major-league fastball, but
sometimes has problems with his control.

95
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,028
Oh, my. Damn.

96
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,615
One ball, no strike to Willie Foster.

97
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,789
No problem! No problem!

98
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,792
Go get 'em, one, two, three, babe.
Get 'em, big guy.

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,753
Ninety-five miles an hour.

100
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,381
That's great. He looks just great.

101
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,394
Stepping in for the Peninsula
White Sox, second baseman Allen Powley.

102
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,812
What's it say?

103
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,399
It says he's not bending his back
on his follow-through.

104
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,404
Scotty, baby, take this to Ebby Calvin.

105
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:14,034
All right, honey, let's get down to it.
How was Ebby Calvin LaLoosh?

106
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,453
Well, he fucks like he pitches.

107
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,206
Sort of all over the place.

108
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,108
My!

109
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,036
He walked 18.

110
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,205
A new league record.

111
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,417
- Struck out 18.
- Another new league record.

112
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,794
In addition, he hit the sportswriter,

113
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,964
the public address announcer,
the Bull mascot twice.

114
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,800
Also, new league records.

115
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,599
But, Joe, this guy's got some serious shit.

116
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,519
- Yeah, serious shit. Yes.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,237
Who are you? Who's he?

118
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,822
I'm "the player to be named later."

119
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,326
Crash Davis? I'm Joe Riggins.

120
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,454
And you, Larry Hockett,
should recognize me

121
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,666
'cause five years ago in the Texas League

122
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,835
you were pitching for El Paso,
I was hitting clean-up for Shreveport.

123
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,005
You hung a curveball
on an 0-2 pitch in a 3-2 game

124
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,801
in the bottom of the eighth,
and I tattooed it

125
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,887
over the Michelin tire sign, beat you 4-3.

126
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,889
I remember. I should have thrown a slider.

127
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,891
Damn, Crash, how you doing?

128
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,269
I'm too old for this shit.

129
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,355
Why the hell am I back in A ball?

130
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,817
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

131
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,777
Big club's got 100 grand in him.

132
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,738
He's got a million-dollar arm
with a five-cent head.

133
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,116
Had a gun on him tonight.

134
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,452
Last five pitches he threw
were faster than the first five.

135
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,248
He's got the best young arm
I've seen in 30 years.

136
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,041
You've been around.

137
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,419
You're smart. You're a professional.

138
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,630
We want you to mature the kid.

139
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,383
We want you to room with him
on the road.

140
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,469
Stay on his case all year.
He can go all the way.

141
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,598
Yeah? Where can I go?

142
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,352
You can keep going to the ballpark
and keep getting paid to do it.

143
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,105
Beats the hell out of working at Sears.

144
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,401
Sears sucks, Crash.
I once worked there. Sold Lady Kenmores.

145
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,403
Nasty... Nasty work.

146
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,991
Even if it is the Carolina League
this is a chance to play every day.

147
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,410
You don't want a player.
You want a stable pony.

148
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,494
No.

149
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,246
Well, my AAA contract gets bought out

150
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,915
so I can hold the flavor-of-the-month's
dick in the bus leagues.

151
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,835
Is that it? Fuck this fucking game!

152
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,431
I fucking quit, all right? I quit.

153
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,076
Who we play tomorrow?

154
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,788
Winston-Salem. Batting practice, 11:30.

155
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,294
So, how's it feel to get
your first professional win?

156
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,589
It feels out there. It's a major rush.

157
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,051
I mean, it doesn't just feel out there,
it feels out there.

158
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,721
Kind of radical in a kind of tubular way,
you know.

159
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,640
But most of all, it's out there.

160
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,061
This is hopeless.
This is utterly, fucking hopeless.

161
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,826
Hey, I'm Millie.

162
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,830
- I'm Tony. I play second base.
- I know.

163
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,000
Max, how do you just keep
coming back every year?

164
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,171
'Cause I love the game, Annie. I love it.

165
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,298
- Here you go.
- We didn't order these, honey.

166
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,092
- He did.
- Who?

167
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,010
The guy in the booth.

168
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,099
Who's that?

169
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,395
That's Crash Davis. Hey, Crash, come here.

170
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,063
Come over here.

171
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,900
He's kind of cute.

172
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,403
He's played
in more ballparks than I have.

173
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,821
Hell of a guy.

174
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,698
He's really different.

175
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,493
I actually saw him read a book
without pictures once.

176
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,206
- Hi, Max.
- How you doing, Crash?

177
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,876
Come over and sit down.

178
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,336
I'm Crash.

179
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,214
Annie Savoy. Wanna dance?

180
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,716
I don't dance.

181
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,676
How embarrassing.

182
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,223
What is that?

183
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,324
- Who's he dancing with?
- All of them, I think.

184
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,923
You Annie Savoy?

185
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,217
Thanks for your note. You're right.
I wasn't bending my back.

186
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,803
- You got a live arm there.
- Thanks.

187
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,306
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

188
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,099
You need a nickname, honey.

189
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,268
You know, I've been
telling everybody that.

190
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,605
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,941
She's dancing with me.

192
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,151
Afraid not, pal.

193
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,238
You boys gonna fight over little old me?

194
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,951
- No.
- Let's go.

195
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,161
Step outside and party, man.

196
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,168
Don't be such guys. Max, let's dance.

197
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,303
You coming or not, homeboy?

198
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,486
Let's go, man. Come on. We're waiting.

199
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,406
- Let's go, homeboy.
- Come on, Ebby. There he is.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,294
Look, I don't believe in fighting.
Let's just...

201
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,507
That's really sweet. "I don't believe..."
Fuck you, you pussy.

202
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,680
All right. Take the first shot at me.

203
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,182
No way, man. I don't hit no man first.

204
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,354
All right, then.

205
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,567
Hit me in the chest with that.

206
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,821
I'd kill you.

207
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,449
Yeah? From what I hear,
you couldn't hit water

208
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,534
if you fell out of a fucking boat.

209
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,540
Throw it, man.

210
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,418
Throw it, come on. Right in the chest.

211
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,754
- No way.
- Come on, Meat.

212
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,880
You're not gonna hit me

213
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,716
'cause you're starting
to think about it already.

214
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,260
Starting to think
how embarrassing it would be

215
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,056
to miss in front of all these people,
how somebody might laugh.

216
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,059
Come on, rook.
Show us that million-dollar arm

217
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,813
'cause I got a good idea
about that five-cent head of yours.

218
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,024
- Nail him, drop him.
- Hit him, man! Hit him!

219
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,363
Fuck!

220
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,574
Ball four.

221
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,993
Who the fuck are you, man?

222
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,084
Good punch.

223
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,086
I'm Crash Davis. I'm your new catcher

224
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,215
and you just got lesson number one,
don't think.

225
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,842
It can only hurt the ball club.

226
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,267
Come inside, I'll buy you a drink.

227
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,943
He's my new catcher.

228
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,582
We fight, she gets the clown.
How's that happen?

229
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,127
God, I like this song.

230
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,474
Did you boys stop fighting?

231
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,643
Pals now?

232
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,812
That's good.

233
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,190
I love a little macho male bonding.

234
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,234
I think it's sweet. I do.

235
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,279
Even if it probably is latent
homosexuality being rechanneled.

236
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,323
I'm all for rechanneling,
so who cares, right?

237
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,080
Okay, shall we go to my place?

238
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,961
- Which one of us?
- Both of you, of course.

239
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,374
These are the ground rules.

240
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,084
I hook up with one guy a season.

241
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,545
Usually takes me a couple weeks
to pick the guy.

242
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,964
It's kind of my own spring training.

243
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,719
Well, you two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

244
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,598
So, I just thought we should kind of
get to know each other.

245
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,683
Time-out. Why do you get to choose?

246
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,227
Time-out. Why do you get to choose?

247
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,063
- Why?
- Why do you get to choose?

248
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,066
Why don't I get to choose?
Why doesn't he get to choose?

249
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,070
Actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

250
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:19,324
It's all a question of quantum physics,
molecular attraction and timing.

251
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,245
There are laws we don't understand
that bring us together and tear us apart.

252
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,831
It's like pheromones.

253
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,708
You get three ants together,
they can't do dick.

254
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,379
You get 300 million of them,
they can build a cathedral.

255
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,759
So is somebody gonna go to bed
with somebody or what?

256
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,220
Honey, you are a regular
nuclear meltdown.

257
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,097
You better cool off.

258
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,560
Wait a minute. Where you going?

259
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,230
After 12 years in the minor leagues,
I don't try out.

260
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,023
Besides,

261
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:56,069
I don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

262
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,697
What do you believe in, then?

263
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,119
Well, I believe in the soul,
the cock, the pussy,

264
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,246
the small of a woman's back,

265
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,207
the hanging curveball,
high fiber, good Scotch,

266
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,794
that the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

267
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,963
I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

268
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,299
I believe there ought to be
a constitutional amendment

269
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,634
outlawing AstroTurf
and the designated hitter.

270
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,010
I believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography,

271
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,679
I believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography,

272
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,390
opening your presents Christmas morning
rather than Christmas Eve

273
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:30,312
and I believe in long, slow, deep,
soft, wet kisses that last three days.

274
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,065
Good night.

275
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,442
Oh, my.

276
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,694
Crash.

277
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,363
Hey, Annie, what's all this molecule stuff?

278
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,698
Crash.

279
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,744
Crash, wait! All's I want is a date.

280
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,079
I'm not gonna fall in love
with you or nothing.

281
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,708
I'm not interested in a woman
who's interested in that boy.

282
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,959
Good night.

283
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,420
- I'm not interested yet.
- Who you calling a boy?

284
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,130
See you at the yard, Meat.

285
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,342
Damn, nobody's ever said no
to a date with me before.

286
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,636
He's crazy.

287
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,262
I want you bad.

288
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,148
Honey, hold on. Slow down.

289
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,443
I wanna watch.

290
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,698
Go ahead. Put it back on.

291
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,577
Jesus, what kind of chick are you?

292
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,374
When you know how to make love,
then you'll know how to pitch.

293
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,210
I know how to pitch.

294
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,587
Good.

295
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,423
Now take it off slowly.

296
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,271
That's nice.

297
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,240
Oh, my, what a nice back.

298
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,745
Honey. Sweetheart.

299
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,456
Try taking off your shoes and socks first.

300
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,084
My socks? It's cold in here.

301
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:18,753
What?

302
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,756
You think Dwight Gooden
leaves his socks on?

303
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,081
Ebby, honey.

304
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,128
Have you ever been tied up in bed?

305
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,036
Bring it on, baby!

306
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,996
I heard about shit like this.

307
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,998
You ever heard about Walt Whitman?

308
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,708
Who does he play for?

309
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,835
He sort of pitches for
the Cosmic All-Stars.

310
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,171
- Never heard of him.
- Oh, good.

311
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,506
Listen to this.

312
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,011
"I sing the body electric"

313
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,973
"The armies of those I love engirth me
and I engirth them"

314
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,852
"They will not let me off
till I go with them, respond to them"

315
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,439
"And discorrupt them and charge them full
with the charge of the soul."

316
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:09,572
"But the expression of a well-made man
appears not only in his face"

317
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,450
"it is in his limbs and joints also."

318
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,035
- Excuse me.
- "It is..."

319
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,705
Are we gonna fuck or what?

320
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:24,963
"It is curiously in the joints
of his hips and wrists"

321
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,466
"love-flesh swelling and
deliciously aching."

322
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,555
"Limitless limpid jets of love,
hot and enormous."

323
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,399
Listen up, guys.
Can I have your attention a minute?

324
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,776
I'm gonna be leading a daily chapel
service here in the locker room

325
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,154
- at 3:00 in the afternoon.
- Amen, brother!

326
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,407
Y'all are invited to stop on by
and worship before batting practice.

327
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,285
Jimmy, God damn it.
Loosen up and get laid.

328
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:02,959
I know y'all think I'm pretty square,
but I believe what I believe.

329
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,424
Jesus, Ebby, you look like
a truck ran over you.

330
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,636
Nuke. Call me Nuke.

331
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,931
Annie says it's my new nickname.

332
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,601
Okay, Nuke. Go get 'em.

333
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,895
Annie nailed you? Annie did?

334
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,314
That's great. That means
you're gonna have a great year.

335
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:28,776
Is she as good as they say?

336
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,572
No, man, we didn't fuck.

337
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,784
No, she read poetry to me all night.

338
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,287
It's more tiring than fucking.

339
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,711
"Limpid jets of love."

340
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:52,675
Hey, Crash.
Does that mean what I think it means?

341
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,302
"Limpid jets of love."

342
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,971
Your shower shoes have fungus on them.

343
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:01,267
You'll never make it to the bigs
with fungus on your shower shoes.

344
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,937
Think classy, you'll be classy.

345
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,688
If you win 20 in the Show

346
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,316
you can let the fungus
grow back on your shower shoes

347
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,610
and the press will think you're colorful.

348
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:15,615
Until you win 20 in the Show,
however, it means you're a slob.

349
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,829
Y'all don't forget

350
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,041
Saturday is Bull Day
down at the Northgate Mall.

351
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,794
Strike!

352
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,880
Too bad, Butch. Too bad.

353
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,341
Charge!

354
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,137
Not getting that cheese by me, Meat.

355
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:42,600
And now batting for the Bulls,
number eight, Crash Davis.

356
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,028
Foul ball!

357
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,698
God, stupid fuck, Crash.

358
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,700
What'd you swing at a breaking ball for?

359
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,076
Fuck me.

360
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,166
You usually start me off with a hammer.

361
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:11,337
You're thinking too much, Crash.
Get out of your fucking head.

362
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,172
Don't let him in your kitchen.

363
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,926
Come on, Crash. Just relax.
You got it, honey.

364
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,637
All right, here we go. Stay back. Relax.

365
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,556
Quick bat. Quick bat.

366
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,766
Foul ball!

367
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:32,066
Throw that shit again, Meat.
Throw that weak-ass shit again.

368
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,902
Okay, he's got vision there.
Get close, baby, you got it.

369
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,821
One more, baby, one more.
You got him.

370
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,241
All right, he's gonna throw the deuce now.

371
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,951
He's gotta waste one.

372
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,621
Stay back and wipe
that silly grin off his face.

373
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,333
Come on. Bring it. Bring it.

374
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,168
Jesus Christ!

375
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,253
What was that? What the hell was that?

376
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,047
What goes around, comes around.

377
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,965
Son of a bitch throws hard.

378
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,928
It's okay, Crash. You take it easy, honey.

379
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,056
Go, Crash!

380
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:07,226
All right, one and two.
You can hit this shit. Relax.

381
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,270
Annie. Annie.

382
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,773
Annie. Who's this Annie?

383
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,776
Jesus, get out of the box, you idiot.
Where's your head?

384
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,611
Get the broad out of your head!

385
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,279
- Time out!
- Time out!

386
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,784
Give me a rag.

387
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,330
Get a hit, Crash.

388
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,248
Shut up.

389
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,884
All right, you've seen all his pitches.

390
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,803
You've seen them all.

391
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:46,224
Shorten up, Crash. Bring me the gas, kid.

392
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,767
Bring me the gas.

393
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,227
Bring me the gas.

394
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,147
Quick bat. Quick bat. Quick bat.

395
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,816
Strike!

396
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,032
Scotty, baby, take this to Crash.

397
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,412
Folks,
we have a little lost girl up here.

398
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,832
Says her name is Lana Ann Baker.

399
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,501
- She'll be waiting...
- It's for Crash.

400
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,378
At the ticket box
for her daddy, Cedar Baker.

401
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,672
- Cedar, come on and get your little girl.
- Crash.

402
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,216
- What?
- From Annie.

403
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,634
Read it.

404
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:30,643
"Dear Crash, you have a lovely swing but
you're pulling your hips out too early."

405
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,605
"I'd be happy to meet with you tomorrow
at the batting cage to discuss it."

406
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,274
Signed, "Annie."

407
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,861
If there's one chick who'd know
you were pulling your hips out early

408
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,487
it'd be Annie.

409
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,665
It's kind of a personal note, kid,
so don't read it.

410
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,250
There you go.

411
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,594
Here, Millie.

412
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,179
What's it say?

413
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:11,642
It says, "I wanna make love to you. Crash."

414
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,436
Oh, my.

415
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,822
- See my hips?
- Yep.

416
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,785
And I think Susan Sontag is brilliant.

417
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,789
Is this gonna happen? Us?

418
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,711
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.

419
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,799
You had your chance the other day.

420
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,676
What is it you see in this guy?

421
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,388
He's a young, wild,

422
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,724
dim pretty boy.

423
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,894
Young men are uncomplicated.

424
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:58,940
And he's not dim. He's just inexperienced.

425
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:04,904
It's my job to give him life wisdom
and help him get on to the major leagues.

426
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,490
That's funny, that's my job, too.

427
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,784
Damn!

428
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:12,828
You're pulling your hips.

429
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:16,832
I know.
I know, I know, but they're nice hips.

430
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,502
- I looked up your records.
- You what?

431
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,463
You hit 227 home runs in the minors.

432
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,967
- That's not bad.
- Don't tell anybody.

433
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,885
Why not? You hit 20 more this year

434
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,929
you're gonna be the all-time
minor-league champ.

435
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,556
The record's 246.

436
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,770
Well, 247 home runs in the minor-leagues
would be a kind of dubious honor.

437
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,481
I think it would be great.
The Sporting News should know about it.

438
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,985
No. Just no. Please.

439
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,487
Okay.

440
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,951
Last chance, your place or mine?

441
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,162
Despite my rejection
of most Judeo-Christian ethics

442
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:59,041
I am, within the framework
of the baseball season, monogamous.

443
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,837
- Give me a break.
- It's true.

444
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,088
Stop it.

445
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,343
Jeez, the fact is

446
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,887
you're afraid of meeting a guy like me,
'cause it might be real

447
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,891
so you sabotage it with some,
what is it, bullshit

448
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,894
about commitment to a young boy
you can boss around.

449
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,689
- That's a great deal.
- Nice.

450
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,524
I know women like you.

451
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,152
I know women like you.

452
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,779
You're a regular patron saint, you know.

453
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:32,033
Stray cats, lost causes

454
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,578
"or 6'3" homeless studs.

455
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,873
Oh, Crash, you do make speeches.

456
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,427
My!

457
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,682
Crash, that was fabulous.

458
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,894
Crash?

459
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,898
You mean Nuke. You said, "Crash."

460
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:10,196
No, honey, I said, "Nuke."

461
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,782
- You said, "Crash."
- Oh, no.

462
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,409
Listen, sweetheart,
you shouldn't listen to what a woman says

463
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,621
when she's in the throes of passion.

464
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,915
They say the darndest things.

465
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,750
Yeah, you said, "Crash."

466
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,753
Honey,

467
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,756
would you rather I'd be making love
to him using your name

468
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,426
or making love to you using his name?

469
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,934
Yeah, maybe you're right.

470
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,607
Welcome to the Eastern Seaboard
Tobacco Growers

471
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,694
City Council Little League Cash Drop Day.

472
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:54,073
These young fellas, young men,
I should say, over here to my left...

473
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:57,118
Hi, 18. Hi, 12.

474
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,661
Hey, Dino.

475
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,959
Hey, Millie.

476
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,132
Hey. I'm Millie.

477
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,300
I'm married.

478
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,644
- What is that?
- Chicken bone cross.

479
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,314
Takes the curse off the bat
that brings me hits.

480
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,192
What are you, a goddamn witch?

481
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,320
Yes, a switch-hitting witch.

482
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,699
Will that work for me?

483
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,784
If you believe in voodoo.

484
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,620
Jose, I am zero for 16.

485
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,873
A big fucking donut hole for 16.

486
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,500
I can't remember the last time
I had a base hit.

487
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,377
Come on, man.
Let me have some of that stuff.

488
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,005
Man, that is not belief.
That's desperation.

489
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,341
Jose, come on. Just touch my bat once.

490
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,179
Come on, just once.
I won't bother you the rest of the day.

491
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,181
I swear to God. Just touch the bat once.

492
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,435
Ladies and gentlemen,
five, four

493
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,022
three, two, one.

494
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,691
Let her go!

495
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,819
One thousand big ones!

496
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,794
That batter ain't nothing.
Come on, Nuke.

497
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,555
Cut it!

498
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,267
Time-out.

499
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,520
Let's play ball! Let's go!

500
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,397
Stay there. Give me the ball.

501
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,525
Hey.

502
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,820
Relax, all right?

503
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,405
Don't try to strike everybody out.

504
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,742
Strike-outs are boring.
Besides that, they're fascist.

505
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,911
Throw some ground balls.

506
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,871
It's more democratic.

507
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,707
What's this guy know, anyway?

508
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,794
If he's so great, how come he's
been in the minors for 10 years?

509
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,088
If he's so hot, how come
Annie wants me instead of him?

510
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,214
Oh, hey.

511
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,551
And another thing, Meat,
you don't know shit. All right?

512
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,761
You wanna make it to the Show,
you'll listen to me.

513
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,139
Annie only wants you
'cause she can boss you around. Got it?

514
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,017
Relax. Let's have some fun out here.

515
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,228
This game's fun, okay?

516
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,355
Fun, God damn it.

517
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,108
And don't hold the ball so hard, okay?

518
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,111
It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.

519
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,785
What's he know about fun?
I'm young. I know about fun.

520
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,621
Old man, he don't know nothing about fun.

521
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,957
All right. Nobody's gone out there.

522
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,879
Why's he calling for a curveball?

523
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,381
I wanna bring heat.

524
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,802
Shake him off. Throw what you want.

525
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,142
God damn it. Time-out.

526
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,937
Hey, why you shaking me off?

527
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,649
I wanna bring the heater.
Announce my presence with authority.

528
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,152
- To announce your what?
- Announce my presence with authority.

529
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,112
"To announce your fucking presence
with authority?"

530
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,531
This guy's a first-ball fastball hitter,
he's looking for heat.

531
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,075
Oh, yeah? So what. He ain't seen my heat.

532
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,497
All right, Meat. Give him your heat.

533
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,419
Why is he always calling me Meat?

534
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,421
I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

535
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,549
Fastball.

536
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,306
Come on, Nuke. Settle down.
Settle down, boy. Take your time.

537
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,779
Home run for Burt Crook
of the Fayetteville Generals.

538
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,782
What are you doing? What are you doing
standing here? I gave you a gift.

539
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,868
You stand here showing up my pitcher?
Run, dummy!

540
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,456
Give me the ball.

541
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,795
Well, he really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he?

542
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,881
- I held it like an egg.
- And he scrambled the son of a bitch.

543
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,633
Look at that. He hit the fucking bull.

544
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,635
Guy gets a free steak.

545
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,515
- You having fun yet?
- Oh, yeah, I'm having a blast, thanks.

546
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,724
Good.

547
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,728
Sucker teed off on that like he knew
I was gonna throw a fastball.

548
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,398
- He did know.
- How?

549
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,233
I told him.

550
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,653
One down now!

551
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,323
Come on, Nuke. You're the man.
No batter. Chuck hard, baby.

552
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,784
Don't think, just throw.

553
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,036
Don't think, just throw.

554
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,922
Strike!

555
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,093
God, that was beautiful. What did I do?

556
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,853
Hang on, Millie. Here we go again.

557
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,504
That's the first home run
of the year for Crash Davis.

558
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:47,217
That brings the score up to
Fayetteville 14, Durham 2.

559
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,971
Hell of a shot.

560
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,807
Sorry it got wasted.

561
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,936
I don't know what to do with these guys.

562
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,732
I beg. I plead. I try to be a nice guy.

563
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,859
- I'm a nice guy. But I don't...
- Scare 'em.

564
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,987
They're kids. Scare 'em.

565
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,741
That's what I'd do.

566
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,744
Yeah.

567
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,669
Everybody into the shower!

568
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:26,381
Anybody ain't in this shower
in ten seconds gonna get fined $100.

569
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,467
- Larry.
- One Mississippi,

570
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,385
two Mississippi, three Mississippi,

571
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,180
- four Mississippi...
- Get in there! Hurry it up!

572
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,851
Seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi,
nine Mississippi, ten Mississippi.

573
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:43,273
You guys, you lollygag the ball
around the infield.

574
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,901
You lollygag your way down to first.

575
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,780
You lollygag in and out of the dugout.

576
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,449
You know what that makes you? Larry.

577
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,409
- Lollygaggers.
- Lollygaggers.

578
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,122
- What's our record, Larry?
- Eight and 16.

579
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,874
Eight and 16.

580
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,211
- How'd we ever win eight?
- It's a miracle.

581
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,754
It's a miracle.

582
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,342
This is a simple game.

583
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,679
You throw the ball.

584
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,848
You hit the ball.

585
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,892
You catch the ball.

586
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,353
You got it?

587
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:27,067
Now we have got a 12-day road trip
starting tomorrow.

588
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,530
Bus leaves 6:00 in the morning.

589
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,451
Goddamn, son of a bitching,
motherfucking shithead. God damn it!

590
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,374
Yeah, Skipper, you wanted to see me?

591
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,919
Yeah, Bobby. Shut the door.

592
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,433
This is the toughest job a manager has.

593
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,396
But the organization
has decided to make a change.

594
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,481
They're releasing you from your contract.

595
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:10,402
Skip, I know I'm in a goddamn slump,
but I hit the ball hard today.

596
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,947
Couple flares drop in for me,
I'm right back in the groove.

597
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,992
Sorry.

598
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,212
Let's go. Come on.

599
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,464
Nuke, honey.

600
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:35,219
Let's go. Come on. We got five hours.
Hurry up. Five hour drive coming up.

601
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,308
Honey, I want you to wear these
when you're pitching on the road.

602
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,268
- What are they?
- They're garters.

603
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,811
They're gonna hug your waist and snuggle

604
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,564
and kind of dangle off your thighs
and buns in such a wonderful way.

605
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,316
It'll help you see things differently.

606
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,652
Plus, it'll remind you of me,
which is a lot nicer

607
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,363
than thinking about all
those nasty hitters.

608
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,907
Jesus, Annie, I don't know.

609
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,992
You've been pitching
out of the wrong side of your brain.

610
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,536
This will help put things
on the right side.

611
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,997
Big-league pitchers don't use these.

612
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,375
They did when they were
in the Carolina League.

613
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,795
Nuke. Nuke, excuse me.
Time to go to work.

614
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,004
All right.

615
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,806
Bye, y'all. Bye.

616
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,224
Give me a break.

617
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,560
Go get 'em, boys!
Hit them where they ain't.

618
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,563
Stop it.

619
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,732
Thank you.

620
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,735
- What?
- It's not "woolly."

621
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,279
Nobody gets "woolly."
Women get "weary."

622
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,072
They don't get "woolly."

623
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,825
Nobody's got "stress,"
they're wearing a "dress."

624
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,870
God damn, I hate people
that get the words wrong.

625
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,915
How come you don't like me?

626
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:32,085
You don't respect yourself,
which is your problem.

627
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,882
But you don't respect the game,
and that's my problem.

628
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,760
- You got a gift.
- What do I got?

629
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,262
You got a gift. When you were a baby,
the gods reached down

630
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,514
and turned your right arm
into a thunderbolt.

631
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,184
You got a Hall of Fame arm,
but you're pissing it away.

632
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,895
I ain't pissing nothing away.
I got a Porsche already.

633
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,397
I got a 911 with a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

634
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,983
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

635
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,985
What you need is a curveball.

636
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,071
In the Show, everybody can hit a fastball.

637
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,114
How would you know?

638
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,617
You've been in the majors?

639
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,955
Yeah, I've been in the majors.

640
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,916
You were? Yeah?

641
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,001
You've been in the Show, man?

642
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,754
Yeah, I was in the Show.

643
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,549
I was in the Show for 21 days once.

644
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,429
Twenty-one greatest days of my life.

645
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,391
You know, you never handle your luggage
in the Show.

646
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,393
Somebody else carries your bags.

647
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,186
It's great.

648
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,814
You hit white balls for batting practice.

649
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,983
Ballparks are like cathedrals.

650
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,155
The hotels all have room service.

651
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,576
The women all have long legs and brains.

652
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,499
- They're really hot?
- Yeah, and so are the pitchers.

653
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,085
They throw ungodly breaking stuff
in the Show.

654
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,837
Exploding sliders.

655
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,591
You could be one of those guys.

656
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,720
Nuke could be one of those guys,
but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

657
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:09,641
Listen, I am sick and fucking tired of you
calling me Meat.

658
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,853
You wanna step outside?

659
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,604
Yeah, I'll step outside.

660
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,149
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, Crash!

661
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,568
He was kidding. He was kidding.

662
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,196
What's the problem?

663
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,157
Crash, Crash. Nuke, what's happening?

664
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,244
I was just gonna ask Crash to show me
how to throw a breaking ball.

665
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,789
Good idea. Did anybody bring a ball?

666
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,790
Good idea. Did anybody bring a ball?

667
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,786
Double off the wall by Higgins.

668
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,455
Once again,
the Durham pitchers are unable

669
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,831
to get the first out of the inning.

670
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:39,272
The Bulls will attempt to
end a six-game losing streak

671
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,734
against the Greensboro Hornets
with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill.

672
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,121
Base hit to center field off LaLoosh.

673
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,838
That closes the book on LaLoosh today.

674
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:08,468
Five earned runs, five hits, five strikeouts,
five walks and five wild pitches.

675
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,096
It's time to tell it
like it is, sports fans.

676
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,641
And this is the most wretched
road trip I've seen in 20 years.

677
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:17,477
And possibly the worst Durham team
in half a century.

678
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,897
Is the modern-day athlete
a pale imitation of the great old warriors?

679
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:23,149
Only Crash Davis stands out this year.

680
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,360
Begging the question,
what are these boys thinking about?

681
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,487
'Cause it sure ain't baseball.

682
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,675
Hey, Mr. Hormone, check out this.

683
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,012
Ice-skaters. God, look at them.

684
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:54,180
Hey, fellas, that's what we need, man.

685
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,017
One night with some of these skaters,
we can get right back on track.

686
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,184
Yeah, right.

687
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,687
Just need a night off
to end our losing streak.

688
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,856
What we need is a rainout.

689
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,524
I can get us a rainout.

690
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,152
Man, there ain't been a cloud
in the sky in weeks.

691
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,115
Hundred bucks says I can get us
a rainout for tomorrow.

692
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,789
You're on.

693
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:29,758
I ain't paying for this.
Crash, pay for this.

694
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:32,135
Shut up. You're gonna wake everybody up.

695
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,262
Let the bonus baby pay for it.

696
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,308
Jesus, man.

697
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,162
Crash, what are you doing?

698
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,131
Oh, my goodness!

699
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,136
We got ourselves a natural disaster.

700
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,283
Hey, hey.

701
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,660
- Wake up.
- Huh?

702
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,704
You're awake.

703
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,122
You're okay.

704
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,209
You were dreaming.

705
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:12,921
You're okay.

706
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,049
I was playing damn near naked.

707
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:19,010
- What?
- I was naked.

708
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,678
Playing naked.

709
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,515
I know.

710
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,227
I know. I have that dream
all the time, too.

711
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,438
We're almost home.

712
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,614
Watch your head.

713
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,200
Here you go. Let me get that black bag.

714
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:45,411
- I'm not your slave.
- No, that one over there.

715
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,463
Hi.

716
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,279
God, I'm tired.

717
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:22,115
What a trip.

718
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,369
I was lousy. I was worse than lousy.

719
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,999
I mean, every time I pitched,
it was like throwing gasoline on a fire.

720
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,796
I mean, I...

721
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,008
What is all this "I, I, I" stuff?
What about me?

722
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,051
Aren't you glad to see me?

723
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,178
Don't I look nice?

724
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,682
You look great. I'm sorry.

725
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,809
I'm just totally exhausted.

726
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:53,146
Good. Physical exhaustion
can be spiritually fabulous.

727
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,858
What you need is a good game of catch.

728
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,318
Catch?

729
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,155
Baby, come on. Fire one in here.

730
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,657
This is ridiculous. I'm a professional.

731
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,368
Will you just give it a try and lean in?

732
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,997
Thank you.

733
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,501
Now, I want you to breathe
through your eyelids.

734
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:16,669
- My eyelids?
- Yeah.

735
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,838
Like the lava lizards
of the Galápagos Islands.

736
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:22,467
Some lizards have a parietal eye behind
their heads so they can see backwards.

737
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,594
Haven't you ever noticed
how Fernando Valenzuela,

738
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,555
he just doesn't even look when he pitches?

739
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,682
He's a Mayan Indian.

740
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,976
Or an Aztec. I forget which one.
I get them confused.

741
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,062
- So do I.
- Stand up for a second.

742
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,064
I want you to be aware
of the chakra connection

743
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,982
between your feet and your testicles.

744
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,152
- Chakra.
- Your right leg and left testicle

745
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,029
and your left leg and your right testicle.

746
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,698
- I like that.
- I bet you do.

747
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,867
Give me the ball. Come on.
I'm tired of hearing this.

748
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,869
Fire one in there. Come on.

749
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,996
Okay.

750
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,585
You're patronizing me,
and I will not be patronized.

751
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,713
If I throw too hard, I'm
gonna hurt the girl.

752
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,882
This girl has handled a lot of pitchers

753
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:05,885
whose records are a lot better
than one and seven.

754
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,389
- One and six. Give me the goddamn ball.
- Oh, sorry.

755
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,232
- How do you like that?
- That was much better.

756
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,567
Did you see that?
Because your delivery was fully integrated

757
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,445
because you weren't thinking about it,
'cause you were pissed off at me.

758
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,156
Now, that's progress. Come on up here.
Get your butt up here.

759
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,033
Let's bend over, and I'm gonna show you...

760
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:33,454
I give up. I give up. Let's go inside
and make love and fall asleep

761
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,832
until it's time to go to the ballpark.

762
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,587
Or we could just take
all that sexual energy

763
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,757
and kind of hold onto it for a few hours

764
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:48,261
and then rechannel it
into your pitching tonight.

765
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,641
You're a powerful young thing,
Ebby Calvin.

766
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,271
You want something
for that sore shoulder?

767
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,940
Yeah, I want that shit
that don't smell bad.

768
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,943
- It's on back order.
- Give him some of that shit.

769
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,499
That's hot.

770
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,753
No, I mean it, that's very hot.

771
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,798
Annie says it'll keep one side of my brain

772
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,093
occupied while I'm on the mound,
thus keeping my brain slightly off-center

773
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,138
which is where it should be
for artists and pitchers.

774
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,474
Okay.

775
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,813
She also said I should throw
whatever pitches you call for.

776
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,275
Annie's a very smart lady.

777
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,738
What?

778
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,494
The rose goes in the front, big guy.

779
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:03,461
Now batting for the Salem
Bucks, the center fielder, Joe McCorkle.

780
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,424
This underwear feels kind of sexy.

781
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,178
That don't make me queer, right? Right.

782
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,018
Breaking ball.

783
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,565
Yeah!

784
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,110
All right! Good way to start, baby.

785
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,989
I ain't queer. No, I ain't.

786
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,746
Fastball.

787
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,709
Strike!

788
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,130
Ninety-six miles an hour. He looks good

789
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,048
but why is he all twisting up like that?

790
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,884
He's using his parietal eye,
just like Fernando.

791
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,387
Whoo, that was a humdinger.

792
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,722
Yeah.

793
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,395
Fastball again? Why's he want the heat?

794
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,856
I just threw heat. Don't think, Meat.

795
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,941
Just give them the gas.

796
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:11,988
Strike!

797
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,159
Jesus, what's got into Nuke?

798
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,660
He's wearing garters

799
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,997
and he's breathing out of his eyelids
like a lava lizard.

800
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,623
It's an old Mayan deal.

801
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,584
- Aztec.
- Aztec deal.

802
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,885
Got it! I got it!

803
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,139
Way to go. Hustle in!

804
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,603
Have my mojo working.

805
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,771
You know what a mojo is?

806
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,440
- Sure.
- No, you don't.

807
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,109
I was great, huh?

808
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,446
Your fastball was up.
Your curveball's hanging.

809
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,282
In the Show, they would have ripped you.

810
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,493
Can't you even let me enjoy the moment?

811
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,287
The moment's over.

812
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,000
Come on, Crash.

813
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,628
This guy starts me off with a breaking ball

814
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,714
I'm taking him downtown.

815
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,223
I dare you to throw me the hammer.

816
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,141
You ain't that stupid.

817
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:25,478
Stepping up to the plate
for Durham, our own Crash Davis.

818
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,647
Come on.
Put your hands together for Crash.

819
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,981
Let's hear it!

820
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,236
Let's go.

821
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,822
Come on, Meat.
Bring me that weak-ass shit.

822
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,659
Bring it. Bring it. Bring it.

823
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,749
Oh, my.

824
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,717
Two-nothing Bulls in the second.

825
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:59,887
First time the Bulls have been
ahead in weeks, eh, Whitey?

826
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,682
Let's see if the real
Nuke LaLoosh will show up.

827
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,143
There you go! Dig in there!

828
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,446
Back! Back! Back!

829
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,448
Crash, you got room!

830
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,701
You got room!

831
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,123
All right, yeah!

832
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,585
What are you doing out here?
I'm cruising, man.

833
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,171
I want you to throw
the next one at the mascot.

834
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,424
Why? I'm finally throwing it
where I want to throw it.

835
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,592
Just throw it at the bull, all right?

836
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:39,969
Trust me.

837
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,807
He's the boss.

838
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:51,564
A staggering start by LaLoosh.

839
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,900
He's thrown five outs on nine pitches,
all of them strikes.

840
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,653
He's got pinpoint control
here tonight, Bull fans.

841
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:59,071
Here's the pitch.

842
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,207
This guy's crazy.

843
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,294
Yep. I wouldn't dig in there if I was you.

844
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,379
Next one might be at your head.

845
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,966
I don't know where it's gonna go.

846
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,551
I swear to God.

847
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,612
You're the man! You're the man!
Easy game!

848
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,783
Top of the ninth. Two outs.

849
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,411
One out away from a stunning
two-hit shutout for LaLoosh.

850
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:51,415
Bring it on, Meat. Don't let up.

851
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,292
You own these guys.

852
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,629
Dad would love a shutout.

853
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,260
No. No, no.

854
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:08,599
No, no, he's looking for heat.

855
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,476
Let me give him the deuce.

856
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,978
Play ball!

857
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,148
Oh, no, he's shaking off the signs.

858
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,566
Big mistake.

859
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,027
This son of a bitch
is throwing a two-hit shutout.

860
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:22,613
He's shaking me off. You believe that shit?

861
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,827
Charlie, here comes the deuce.

862
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,496
And when you speak of me, speak well.

863
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,838
- No, no. Serve it up.
- Yeah.

864
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,515
Home run.

865
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,851
Give me the ball.

866
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,693
You told him I was gonna
throw a deuce, right?

867
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,944
Yep.

868
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,115
Man, that ball got out of here in a hurry.

869
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,244
Anything that travels that far ought
to have a damn stewardess on it.

870
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,954
Don't you think?

871
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:52,244
When Nuke started listening to
Crash, everything fell into place.

872
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,498
He started throwing strikes,
and we started to win.

873
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,958
But Nuke was still confused.

874
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,919
He was so encouraged by his victory

875
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,796
that he vowed not to have sex
until he lost.

876
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,924
Unfortunately, however,
he kept on winning

877
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,218
and for one extraordinary June and July

878
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:13,015
the Durham Bulls began playing baseball
with joy and verve and poetry.

879
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:17,478
The two sides of my own brain
were all jumbled up and cross-wired.

880
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,522
While one side was being neglected

881
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,275
the other was in paradise watching
our Bulls play like big-leaguers.

882
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:27,279
We swept a four-game series at Kinston,
two games at Winston-Salem

883
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,616
and kicked the holy shit
out of Greensboro in a three-game set.

884
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,660
And Crash, who kept hitting dingers

885
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:37,289
was approaching the minor-league record,
though I told nobody.

886
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:43,629
After sweeping the July 4 doubleheader
the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

887
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:48,175
Beautiful as the winning streak was,
I was getting damn lonely.

888
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,177
Something had to be done.

889
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:52,054
I needed a man.

890
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,189
Yeah!

891
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:04,441
I love winning, man.

892
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,819
I fucking love winning.

893
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,364
You hear what I'm saying?
It's like better than losing.

894
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,618
Teach me something new. I need to learn.

895
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,662
Teach me something.

896
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,831
You got something to write with?

897
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,791
Good. It's time to work
on your interviews.

898
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,252
My interviews? What do I gotta do?

899
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,379
You have to learn your clichés.

900
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,882
You're gonna have to study them,
you're gonna have to know them.

901
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,677
They're your friends. Write this down.

902
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,598
We gotta play 'em one day at a time.

903
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,642
"Got to play..."

904
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,352
- It's pretty boring.
- Of course it's boring.

905
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,729
That's the point. Write it down.

906
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:45,357
"One day at a time."

907
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,193
I'm just happy to be here.

908
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,696
Hope I can help the ball club.

909
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,782
I know. Write it down.

910
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:58,871
I just wanna give it my best shot.

911
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:03,208
And the good Lord willing,
things will work out.

912
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:07,212
"Good Lord willing

913
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:10,007
- "things will work out."
- Things will work out.

914
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,550
How's Annie?

915
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,931
She's getting pretty steamed, actually,

916
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:21,060
'cause I'm still rechanneling
my sexual energy.

917
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,148
I'm figuring I'm just gonna cave in
and sleep with her.

918
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,734
You know, to calm her down.

919
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,111
Are you out of your mind?

920
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,572
- I'm just... Talking about one time.
- Are you out of your mind?

921
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,659
If you give in now, you might start losing.

922
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:44,083
Never fuck with a winning streak.

923
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,548
Hi, boys.

924
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,927
Hi, darling. Get in here.

925
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,804
Hey, Jimmy!

926
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,347
Want a ride?

927
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:03,686
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

928
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,312
No.

929
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,107
Can I give you my testimony?

930
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,318
You can do anything you want.

931
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,449
Hop in.

932
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,123
I am so proud of you guys.

933
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:32,297
- You want some more soup, honey?
- No, thanks. That was great.

934
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:39,513
How about a little back rub?

935
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,515
No, I'm okay.

936
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,809
I think I'll just take a little nap.

937
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,811
You want me to tuck you in?

938
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,230
Annie, you can't seduce me.

939
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,943
Sweetie, I'm not gonna try to seduce you.

940
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,741
- What's that?
- That's my leg.

941
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,159
I know what it is.

942
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,286
I thought maybe we could work
on some fundamentals

943
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:06,915
since we're not gonna make love,
and improve your hand-eye coordination.

944
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,794
- My hand-eye coordination?
- Unsnap my stocking.

945
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:17,384
The other day,
Crash called a woman's... pussy...

946
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,930
You know how the hair is kind of
in a V-shape?

947
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,932
Yes, I do.

948
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,477
He called it the Bermuda Triangle.

949
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,688
He said a man could get lost in there
and never be heard from again.

950
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:33,776
- What a nasty thing to say.
- He didn't mean it nasty.

951
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:39,156
He said that getting lost and disappearing
from the face of the earth

952
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:43,076
was sometimes a good thing to do,
especially like that.

953
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:49,291
But he also said that there were times
for discipline and self-control.

954
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,293
And I think this is one of those times.

955
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,921
Crash is a very smart man.

956
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,381
Now, honey, let's give it a try.

957
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,556
Here, wait a minute. Watch. Watch.

958
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,730
Now you try. Go ahead.

959
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,492
Yep.

960
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,665
You're playing with my mind.

961
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,291
I'm trying to play with your body.

962
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,918
I knew it. You're trying to seduce me.

963
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,962
Of course I'm trying to seduce you
for God's sake.

964
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,090
I'm doing a damn poor job of it.
Aren't I pretty?

965
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,133
God, I think you're real cute.

966
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:44,221
Cute? Baby ducks are cute. I hate cute!

967
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,641
I wanna be exotic and mysterious.

968
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,728
You are.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute.

969
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:54,898
That's why I better leave.

970
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,150
Nuke, you got it all wrong.

971
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,570
There's no relationship
between sex and baseball.

972
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,280
- Ask Crash.
- I did.

973
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:02,781
And what did he say?

974
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,784
He said, if I give into you,
I'll start losing again.

975
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,829
- He did?
- Yeah.

976
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,623
I'll be back when we lose.

977
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,672
Damn it!

978
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,355
How dare you tell Nuke
to stay out of my bed.

979
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,233
You are messing with my private life!

980
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,819
Knock-knock, you know? Come in.

981
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,988
- Words like, thank you.
- You're confusing him.

982
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,823
- You're bending his mind all out of shape.
- I'm what?

983
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,241
You're confusing him!

984
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,659
I'm confusing him?

985
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,037
You got him breathing out
of the wrong goddamn eyelid.

986
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,331
You got him parading around
the locker room like a fruit.

987
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,375
That is a religious ritual
and it happens to be working,

988
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,501
if you don't mind my saying.

989
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,338
Wait a second. Who dresses you?

990
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,839
- What?
- Who dresses you?

991
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:04,009
You think this is a little excessive
for the Carolina League?

992
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,638
"The road of excess leads to
the palace of wisdom." William Blake.

993
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,681
- William Blake?
- William Blake.

994
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,516
- William Blake?
- William Blake!

995
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:14,937
- What do you mean, "William Blake"?
- I mean, "William Blake."

996
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,400
Who are you? I mean, do you have a job?

997
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:23,612
I teach part-time
at Alamance Junior College,

998
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,448
English 101 and Beginning Composition.

999
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,493
You know, having a conversation
with you is like...

1000
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,163
Is like a Martian talking to a fungo.

1001
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,915
Oh, cute. That's really cute.

1002
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,042
Just because sometimes
you manage to be clever

1003
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:39,628
and have a nice smile,
does not mean you are not full of shit.

1004
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,630
- What, I'm full of shit?
- You are full of shit.

1005
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,423
- What, I'm full of shit?
- You are full of shit.

1006
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:46,051
- Nuke's chastity was your idea.
- I know! I'm telling you

1007
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,886
- keep your hands out of this.
- I never told him

1008
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,930
- to stay out of your bed.
- You most certainly did.

1009
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,848
- I never told him to stay out of your bed.
- Yes, you did.

1010
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:55,185
I told him that a player on a streak
has to respect the streak.

1011
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,561
- Fine.
- You know why?

1012
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,563
- 'Cause they don't happen very often.
- Right.

1013
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,899
If you believe you're playing well
because you're getting laid

1014
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:04,528
or because you're not getting laid,
or because you wear women's underwear

1015
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,572
then you are, and you should know that.

1016
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,872
Come on, Annie.
Think of something clever to say.

1017
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:21,586
Something full of magic,
religion, bullshit.

1018
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,589
Come on. Dazzle me.

1019
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,927
I want you.

1020
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,013
What?

1021
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,349
- I said, "I want you."
- Stop it.

1022
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,982
You're scared.

1023
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,780
Maybe I am.

1024
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,117
But I still think you should leave.

1025
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,289
Okay. Well,

1026
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:00,542
this is the damnedest season
I've ever seen.

1027
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,879
I mean, the Durham Bulls can't lose,
and I can't get laid.

1028
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,803
Come on.
Show them what you got, Super Nuke!

1029
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,473
Show them there, Super Nuke!
Super Nuke!

1030
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:18,810
LaLoosh. L-A-Loosh! Come on, LaLoosh!
L-A-Loosh! L-A-Loosh!

1031
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:22,647
Just relax out there. Don't aim the ball.

1032
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,195
Nuke's overthrowing tonight.
Don't look loose.

1033
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,447
Anything bothering him?

1034
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,240
He says his chakras are jammed.

1035
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,701
He's having trouble breathing
out of his left eyelid.

1036
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:35,827
- Left eyelid?
- Right eyelid.

1037
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:37,120
Right eyelid.

1038
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,170
- Give me the ball.
- Fuck!

1039
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,091
Time out!

1040
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,510
Up to the plate,
Junior Chavley.

1041
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:52,969
What's wrong?

1042
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,347
I'm a little nervous. My old man's here.

1043
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,724
Your dad's here? Where's he at?

1044
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:00,769
He's right behind home plate.
Don't look. Don't look.

1045
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,274
Look, he's waving.
Hey, he's just your old man.

1046
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,901
He's as full of shit as anybody.

1047
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,027
What's going on?

1048
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,029
You breathing through
the wrong fucking eyelid again?

1049
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,573
- Shut up.
- You guys hear about Jimmy and Millie?

1050
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:16,701
They got engaged. Can you believe that?

1051
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:19,746
Yeah? Wait till I tell him she's gone
down on half the Carolina League.

1052
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,833
Anybody says anything bad about Millie,
I break his neck.

1053
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,377
Excuse me, guys.
I've got a game to pitch here.

1054
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,674
Hey, you guys. Don't throw me anything.

1055
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,300
My girlfriend put a curse on my glove.

1056
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:34,594
I'll take the hex off the fucking glove.
Give me the glove.

1057
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,972
You gotta cut the head off a live rooster.

1058
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,182
Guys! Play ball!

1059
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:43,228
What the hell's going on out there?

1060
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,898
Looks like a convention.
Pretty soon they're gonna call the roll.

1061
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,819
- Get your ass out there and check it out.
- You bet.

1062
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,534
- Let's play some baseball!
- Hurry up!

1063
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,705
Excuse me.
What the hell's going on out here?

1064
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,415
Well, Nuke's scared

1065
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,209
'cause his eyelids are jammed
and his old man's here.

1066
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,753
We need a live... Was it a live rooster?

1067
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,256
We need a live rooster
to take the curse off Jose's glove

1068
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,009
and nobody seems to know
what to get Millie or Jimmy

1069
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:15,635
for their wedding present.

1070
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,180
That about right?
We're dealing with a lot of shit.

1071
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,518
Okay, well,
candlesticks always make a nice gift.

1072
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,312
Maybe you could find out
where she's registered.

1073
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,939
Maybe a place setting
or a silverware pattern's good.

1074
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,317
Okay, let's get to it. Go get 'em.

1075
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,612
Come on. Get your ass in gear.

1076
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,243
LaLoosh looks in
for the sign. Here's the pitch.

1077
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:43,079
Ball hit deep in the right
field, off the wall.

1078
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:45,081
You should be at the game, Annie.

1079
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,625
No, I'm fine.

1080
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,294
Beautiful night for baseball here
in Durham.

1081
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,629
And as the batter steps in...

1082
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,883
How much time did you
and Jimmy spend together

1083
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,135
before he proposed?

1084
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:59,304
About five hours, I guess.

1085
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,056
We both just knew.

1086
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,141
Once again, he goes to the rosin bag.

1087
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,434
Annie,

1088
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:08,063
do you think I deserve to wear white?

1089
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,649
Honey, we all deserve to wear white.

1090
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:11,942
Ball two, in the dirt.

1091
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,818
Come on, Nuke, go get them!

1092
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,490
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

1093
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,451
Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

1094
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,619
Come on!

1095
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,287
He's coming. Go home! Home!

1096
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,289
We got him! We got him!

1097
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,585
- Safe!
- No, I got him!

1098
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,587
- You missed him!
- I didn't miss him!

1099
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:36,174
- Don't bump me!
- He still hasn't touched the plate!

1100
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,677
He still ain't touched the plate!

1101
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,722
Fuck it! It's a cocksucking call!

1102
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,225
- Did you call me a cocksucker?
- No, I...

1103
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,852
I said it was a cocksucking call!
You can't throw me for that.

1104
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,063
- You can't run me for that.
- You missed the tag!

1105
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,191
- You just spit on me!
- I did not spit on you!

1106
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:56,361
You're in the wrong business!
You're Sears & Roebuck material!

1107
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:58,905
You're pushing it, buddy!
You want me to run you out? I'll run you!

1108
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:01,533
- You want me to call you a cocksucker?
- Go ahead. Try it.

1109
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,995
Beg me! Pretty please, beg!
Pretty please, beg!

1110
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,871
Call me a cocksucker,
and you're out of here!

1111
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,373
You're a cocksucker.

1112
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,125
- You're a cocksucker.
- You're out of here!

1113
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,418
Shit!

1114
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,337
- What the fuck is that?
- Holy shit!

1115
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:22,345
- He called me a cocksucker!
- He missed the tag!

1116
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,681
I've never seen Crash so angry.

1117
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:27,058
And frankly, sports fans,
he used a certain word

1118
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,060
that's a no-no with umpires.

1119
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,606
Crash must have called
the guy a cocksucker.

1120
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:36,735
Mmm. God, he's so romantic.

1121
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,532
When Crash got thrown out,
the game got out of hand.

1122
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:46,745
Jose made three errors
with his cursed mitt.

1123
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,165
Nuke never quite got in the groove,
though he didn't pitch bad

1124
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:53,877
and the winning streak
came to an end with a 3-2 loss.

1125
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:57,672
The good news was that a man
was about to come calling.

1126
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:01,009
Bad news was it was the wrong guy.

1127
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,588
Annie.

1128
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:44,594
Annie.

1129
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:50,433
I know you're in there.
I can hear that crazy Mexican singer.

1130
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,816
We lost.

1131
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,818
It's okay.

1132
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:04,322
Oh, Annie, I'd like you to meet my father.

1133
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,698
Oh, my!

1134
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,410
Ebby's told me a lot about you.

1135
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:12,789
Ebby tells me you taught him a lot
about discipline and self-control.

1136
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:15,458
We were worried that he might
get involved in the wrong crowd.

1137
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,669
We're so pleased
he met a Christian woman.

1138
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,170
Praise the Lord.

1139
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,674
Excuse me.

1140
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,134
Excuse me, Dad.

1141
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,305
Hello? What?

1142
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,936
- We got a lot of catching up to do.
- Your father is right there.

1143
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,646
Crash tells me I gotta quit
worrying about him

1144
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,399
so I think it's a good opportunity
to go for a quickie.

1145
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,776
We gotta talk. We gotta...

1146
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,361
Hello?

1147
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,489
Yes, he most certainly is here.

1148
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,450
It's Skip for you.

1149
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,494
Hey, Skip, it's me.

1150
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,375
What?

1151
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,087
My God.

1152
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:05,258
Okay.

1153
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,386
Yeah. All right.

1154
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,263
What?

1155
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,223
I'm going to the Show.

1156
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,606
Dad!

1157
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:22,692
They're sending me up to the majors.
I leave first thing in the morning.

1158
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,402
Can you believe it?

1159
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,031
Let's have
a quick word of prayer.

1160
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,741
Oh, let's not.

1161
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,744
I gotta find Crash.
Come on. I'll dump you off.

1162
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:33,912
Wait.

1163
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:38,124
Not so fast. He'll be right with you.

1164
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:41,669
Come on, sweetie.
I just want to have you alone for a second

1165
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:44,214
so we can say goodbye.

1166
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:45,757
I'll be back.

1167
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,301
When somebody leaves Durham,
they don't come back.

1168
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,969
I mean, later.

1169
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:54,432
Oh.

1170
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:01,814
Huh.

1171
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,530
Oh, God, Annie. Jeez.

1172
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:14,702
- What do you have in there?
- Nothing.

1173
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,664
You're not going to
be needing these anymore.

1174
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:20,792
- I'd better take them.
- No, you're ready.

1175
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,545
You think so? You think I'm ready for this?

1176
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,298
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh,

1177
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,428
don't think too much.

1178
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,391
I won't.

1179
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,146
You know something, Annie.

1180
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:46,317
You can't breathe through your eyelids.

1181
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,153
Of course you can't breathe
through your eyelids.

1182
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:52,323
Whoever told you such a ridiculous thing?

1183
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,339
Now, get. Come on.

1184
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,220
Drive careful.

1185
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,308
Oh, my.

1186
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,367
Hey, there you are.

1187
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,911
Crash.

1188
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,458
Hey, Crash, guess what.

1189
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,419
Guess what, man.

1190
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,048
I'm going to the Show.

1191
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,218
Big club's expanding its roster
to finish out the season.

1192
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,386
Nice shot.

1193
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,555
And I am going to the Show.

1194
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,767
So why don't you go then?

1195
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,852
Let's celebrate!

1196
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,064
Congratulations.

1197
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,692
Hope you end up on the cover
of Sports Illustrated

1198
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,361
or maybe a cereal box.

1199
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,198
What's your problem, man?

1200
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,617
I'm trying to thank you.
Come on. Let's get out of this dump.

1201
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,410
- I'll buy you a beer.
- Hey.

1202
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,247
- You calling my place a dump?
- No, he's not. No, he's not.

1203
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,250
- He's not. Are you?
- No.

1204
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:27,585
He's not.

1205
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,420
All right?

1206
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,214
Nuke, do you know who this is?

1207
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,758
This is Sandy Grimes.

1208
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:37,387
Sandy Grimes hit .371
in Louisville in 1967.

1209
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,597
.376.

1210
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:44,060
I'm sorry. He hit .376.
That's a career, man.

1211
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,981
- In any league.
- Got that right.

1212
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:52,860
Did you hear what I said?
I'm going to the Show.

1213
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:57,198
You know what the difference
between hitting .250 and .300 is?

1214
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,243
It's 25 hits.

1215
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:05,289
Twenty-five hits
in 500 at-bats is 50 points. Okay?

1216
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:08,084
There's six months in a season.
That's about 25 weeks.

1217
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:11,462
That means if you get
just one extra flare a week. Just one.

1218
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:13,965
A gork. You get a ground ball.

1219
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,300
You get a ground ball with eyes.

1220
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,636
You get a dying quail.

1221
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:24,684
Just one more dying quail a week
and you're in Yankee Stadium.

1222
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,980
You still don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

1223
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,982
Get the hell out of here.

1224
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,775
All right.

1225
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,861
Fuck.

1226
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,071
Send you a postcard.

1227
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:39,157
Send me a postcard? Hey, I made it.

1228
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,658
You made it. You made shit.

1229
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,702
Hey! Hey!

1230
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:46,998
You crazy?

1231
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,916
What the hell's wrong with you?

1232
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,961
- I'll be all right.
- I'm talking about my mirror.

1233
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,423
Shit, I'm sorry. Hey!

1234
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,675
I'm not gonna fight you, man.
I'm not gonna fight you.

1235
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,761
What do you mean,
you're not gonna fight me, you fuck?

1236
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,054
- Fuck. Why am I a fuck?
- Why are you a fuck?

1237
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:03,723
Because you got talent.

1238
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,726
I got brains, but you got talent.

1239
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:11,314
See this right arm?
Worth a million bucks a year.

1240
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,108
All my limbs put together
aren't worth seven cents a pound.

1241
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,027
What are you talking about?
You're a great catcher.

1242
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:19,030
- I'm a great catcher?
- Yeah.

1243
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:20,656
- Forget it.
- Hey.

1244
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,700
- Fucking forget it.
- Hey, Meat.

1245
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,121
Damn!

1246
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,917
I didn't mean to hit you, man.

1247
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,463
You hurt my eye!

1248
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:39,133
Sorry.

1249
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:42,887
Did you hit me with your right hand,
did you hit me with your left?

1250
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,642
Did you hit me with your right hand,
did you hit me with your left?

1251
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:50,269
- My left.
- Good. That's good.

1252
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:54,690
When you get in a fight with a drunk,
you don't hit him with your pitching hand.

1253
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:58,194
God, I can't keep giving you
these free lessons.

1254
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,738
So quit screwing around and help me up.

1255
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,205
You look great, man.

1256
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,218
Be careful with the bags.

1257
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:25,221
We got a boy going to the Show.

1258
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,335
Sorry about last night.

1259
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,716
Forget it.

1260
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:09,974
I have been known on occasion
to howl at the moon.

1261
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,311
You understand?

1262
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:19,817
No.

1263
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,028
Well, you will.

1264
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,781
Look, Nuke,

1265
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,327
these big-league hitters are going
to light you up like a pinball machine

1266
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,996
for a while, all right?

1267
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:33,956
Don't worry about it.

1268
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:37,668
You be cocky and arrogant,
even when you're getting beat.

1269
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,005
That's the secret.

1270
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:47,219
You gotta play this game
with fear and arrogance.

1271
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,765
Fear and ignorance.

1272
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:56,729
No, fear and arrogance,
you hayseed, not ignorance.

1273
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:58,356
I know. I know.

1274
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:02,026
I just like seeing you get all worked up.

1275
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,533
Listen.

1276
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,580
Thanks.

1277
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,224
Hey, Nuke.

1278
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,395
Good luck.

1279
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:40,731
You too, Meat.

1280
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:03,212
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1281
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:05,256
You may kiss the bride.

1282
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:42,334
Jimmy, we all pitched in,
and we got you a little gift.

1283
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,502
Tony.

1284
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:46,756
Kind of a special wedding cake
from the Durham Bulls.

1285
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,303
Oh, my Lord!

1286
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,768
Yeah, Skip?

1287
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,896
You wanted to see me?

1288
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:06,108
Crash, shut the door.

1289
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:12,531
I wanna thank everyone!

1290
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,366
Give me a piece of that!

1291
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,507
This is the toughest job a manager has.

1292
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,136
But...

1293
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,642
The organization wants to make a change.

1294
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:45,731
Now that Nuke's gone,
they wanna bring up some young catcher.

1295
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:48,192
Some kid hitting .300 in Bluefield.

1296
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,152
He's probably a bust.

1297
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:54,115
I put in a word for you
with the organization.

1298
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:58,577
Told them I thought you might make
a fine minor-league manager someday.

1299
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:05,626
There might be an opening
at Visalia next year.

1300
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,756
You had a hell of a year, Crash.

1301
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:13,551
But...

1302
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,554
you know how it is.

1303
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:41,847
I got released.

1304
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,475
I heard already.

1305
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,053
Oh, my.

1306
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,655
I think probably with my love
for four-legged creatures

1307
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:06,617
and hooves and everything,
that in another lifetime

1308
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:09,453
I was probably Catherine the Great
or Francis of Assisi.

1309
01:35:09,496 --> 01:35:11,455
I'm not sure which one.

1310
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:14,458
What do you think, honey?

1311
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:21,006
How come in former lifetimes
everybody is somebody famous?

1312
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,971
I mean...

1313
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:33,477
How come nobody ever says
they were "Joe Schmoe"?

1314
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,855
Because it doesn't work that way,
you fool.

1315
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:47,449
God, you are gorgeous.

1316
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,870
You wanna dance?

1317
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:08,262
Yes.

1318
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,431
I guess you do.

1319
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:47,462
Crash took off at dawn.

1320
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:50,007
Said he heard there might be
an opening for a catcher in Asheville

1321
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:52,092
in the South Atlantic League.

1322
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,012
A woman should be
so strong and powerful

1323
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:57,639
that she's not affected by such things.

1324
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:00,183
I mean, it wasn't the first time
I went to bed with a guy

1325
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:02,311
and woke up with a note.

1326
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:05,355
At least the son of a bitch
left me breakfast.

1327
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:12,195
You have to respect a ballplayer
who's just trying to finish the season.

1328
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,615
At least, that's what I told myself.

1329
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,827
Baseball may be a religion
full of magic, cosmic truth

1330
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:21,997
and the fundamental ontological
riddles of our time,

1331
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:24,207
but it's also a job.

1332
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,212
Come on, Meat.
Throw me that weak-ass shit.

1333
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:32,591
Come on.
You ain't getting that cheese by me.

1334
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,720
Bring it. Bring it. Bring it.

1335
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:42,726
When Crash hit his 247th home run,
I knew the moment it happened.

1336
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,728
But I'm sure nobody else did.

1337
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:48,565
And The Sporting News
didn't say anything about it.

1338
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:53,111
"Full many a flower is born
to blush unseen,

1339
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:57,324
"And waste its sweetness
on the desert air." Thomas Gray.

1340
01:39:58,076 --> 01:40:01,411
Or William Cullen Bryant.
I don't know. I get 'em mixed up.

1341
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:05,707
Anyway, my attempts at housekeeping
were feeble as usual.

1342
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,502
I sometimes get easily distracted.

1343
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:12,172
Funny thing was
I stopped worrying about Nuke.

1344
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,800
Somehow I knew nothing would stop him.

1345
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:18,970
The world is made for people
who aren't cursed with self-awareness.

1346
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,182
Crash was right, Nuke had a gift.

1347
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:26,228
I'm just happy to be here,
and I hope I can help the ball club.

1348
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,313
You know, I just wanna
give it my best shot.

1349
01:40:28,398 --> 01:40:30,524
And the good Lord willing,
things will work out.

1350
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,818
You know, you gotta play 'em
one day at a time, though.

1351
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:35,028
Raye Anne, right? That's a beautiful name.

1352
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:38,365
Is that Greek? Raye Anne.
It's a beautiful name.

1353
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:40,951
There's a great song by Motley Crue.
Do you know it?

1354
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,370
"Raye Anne, she's a stay in." No?

1355
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,539
Anyway, a good friend of mine
used to say,

1356
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,499
"This is a very simple game."

1357
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:50,127
"You throw the ball,
you catch the ball, you hit the ball."

1358
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:53,380
"Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."

1359
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:56,174
"Sometimes it rains."

1360
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:58,468
Think about that for a while.

1361
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:47,434
Oh, my.

1362
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,521
What happened?

1363
01:42:34,232 --> 01:42:35,398
I quit.

1364
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,529
Hit my dinger and I hung them up.

1365
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,079
I'm quitting too.

1366
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,331
I mean, boys, not baseball.

1367
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:58,255
There might be an opening for a manager
in Visalia next spring.

1368
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,387
Think I could make it
to the Show as a manager?

1369
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:09,432
You'd be great.

1370
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:13,019
You'd be great.

1371
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:19,109
I mean, because you understand
about nonlinear thinking.

1372
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:23,655
I mean, baseball seems like a linear game
with all those lines and box scores.

1373
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:26,283
But the fact is, it's a spacious
non-time kind of time to it.

1374
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:27,450
Annie.

1375
01:43:28,578 --> 01:43:29,744
What?

1376
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:33,164
I got a lot of time to hear your theories.

1377
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:36,459
And I wanna hear every damn one of them,

1378
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:42,048
but now I'm tired and I don't want
to think about baseball.

1379
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:44,426
And I don't wanna think
about quantum physics.

1380
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:46,887
And I don't wanna think about nothing.

1381
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,851
I just wanna be.

1382
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:57,188
I can do that, too.

1383
01:43:59,609 --> 01:44:04,154
Walt Whitman once said,
"I see great things in baseball."

1384
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:07,282
"It's our game. The American game."

1385
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:10,660
"It will repair our losses
and be a blessing to us."

1386
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:12,829
You could look it up.
