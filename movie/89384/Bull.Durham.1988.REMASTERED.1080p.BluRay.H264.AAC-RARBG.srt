[woman]
I believe in the church of baseball.

16
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,845
I've tried all the major religions
and most of the minor ones.

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,098
I've worshipped Buddha,
Allah, Brahma, Vishnu,

18
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,518
Shiva, trees, mushrooms,
and Isadora Duncan.

19
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,812
I know things.

20
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,982
For instance,
there are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary,

21
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,319
and there are 108 stitches in a baseball.

22
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,821
When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance.

23
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,366
But it just didn't work out between us.

24
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,328
The Lord laid too much guilt on me.

25
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,164
I prefer metaphysics to theology.

26
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,959
You see, there's no guilt in baseball,
and it's never boring.

27
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,128
[chuckles] Which makes it like sex.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,425
There's never been a ballplayer slept with me
who didn't have the best year of his career.

29
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,221
Making love is like hitting a baseball.

30
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,681
You just gotta relax and concentrate.

31
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,186
Besides, I'd never sleep with a player
hitting under .250,

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,689
unless he had a lot of RBIs
or was a great glove man up the middle.

33
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,696
You see, there's a certain amount
of life wisdom I give these boys.

34
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,782
I can expand their minds.

35
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,826
Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone,

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,496
I'll just read Emily Dickinson
or Walt Whitman to him.

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,165
And the guys are so sweet.
They always stay and listen.

38
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,044
Of course, a guy'll listen to anything
if he thinks it's foreplay.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,756
I make them feel confident,

40
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,217
and they make me feel safe.

41
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,718
And pretty.

42
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,180
Of course, what I give them lasts a lifetime.

43
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,392
What they give me lasts 142 games.

44
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,603
Sometimes it seems like a bad trade,

45
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,772
but bad trades are part of baseball.

46
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,860

340
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,462
Which one of us?

341
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,131
Well, both of you, of course.

These are the ground rules.

344
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,921
I hook up with one guy a season.

345
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,715
Usually takes me a couple of weeks
to pick the guy.

346
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,717
Kinda my own spring training.

347
00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:01,097
And, well, you two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

348
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,934
So I just thought we should
kinda get to know each other.

349
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,436

Why doesn't he get to choose?

353
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:18,156
Well, actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

354
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,202
I mean, it's all a question of quantum physics,
molecular attraction, and timing.

355
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,330
There are laws we don't understand
that bring us together and tear us apart.

356
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,583
It's like pheromones.

they can't do dick.

364

After 12 years in the minor leagues,
I don't try out.

365

Besides, uh, I don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

366
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,449
What do you believe in then?

367
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,244

are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,674

-She'll be waiting at the main ticket box. . .
-Give it to Crash.

It says, "I want to make love to you. Crash."

He's just inexperienced.

It's my job to give him life wisdom
and to help him get on to the major leagues.

Mm-hmm.
You hit 227 home runs in the minors.

-Why not?

You hit 20 more this year, you're gonna
be the all-time minor league champ.

The record's 246.

581
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:40,439
Well, 247 home runs in the minor leagues
would be a kind of dubious honor.

00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,942
I think it would be great.
The Sporting News should know about it.

This game's fun. Okay?

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,316
It's fun, goddamn it.

681
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,736
And don't hold the ball so hard. Okay?
It's an egg.

682
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,989
Hold it like an egg.

-All right, let's play ball! Come on!

684
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,619
What does he know about fun?

685
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,621
I'm young. I know about fun.

686
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,249
He's an old man.
He don't know nothin' about fun.

687
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,543
[Crash]
All right, nobody's gone out there.

688
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,506
[scoffs]
Why is he calling for a curveball?

689
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,301
I wanna bring heat.

690
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,804
Shake him off. Throw what you want.

691
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,312
Goddamn it. Time out.

692
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,605
Hey!

693
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,524
Why are you shaking me off? Huh?

694
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,694
I want to bring the heater
to announce my presence with authority.

695

-To announce your what?
-To announce my presence with authority.

696

You announce your fucking presence
with authority?

697
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,409
This guy is a first-ball fastball hitter.
He's looking for heat.

698
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,912
Oh, yeah? So what? He ain't seen my heat.

699
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,292
All right, Meat. Give him your heat.

700
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:40,007
Why is he always calling me Meat?
I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

701
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,427
Fastball.

702
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,767

Give me the ball.

711
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:21,173
Well, he really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he? [laughs]

712
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,676
-I held it like an egg.
-Yeah, and he scrambled the son of a bitch.

-Oh, yeah, I'm having a blast. Thanks.

Good.

-How?

719
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,111
I told him.

but I hit the ball hard today.

-What are they?
-They're garters.

790
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,940
They're gonna hug your waist and snuggle

791
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,275
and kinda dangle off your thighs and buns
in such a wonderful way

792
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,277
that'll help you see things differently.

793
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:56,865

Okay.

1013
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,775
She also – She also said that I should throw
whatever pitches you call for.

1014
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,236
Annie's a very smart lady.

1015
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,699
What?

1016
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,205
The rose goes in the front, big guy.

1017
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,836
[woman on PA]
Now batting for the Salem Buffs,

1018
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,297
center fielder Joe McCorkle.

1019
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,799
[grunts]

1020
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,177
This underwear feels kind of sexy.

1021
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,806
Don't make me queer, right? Right.

1022
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,141
Whoo!

1023
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,604
Breaking ball.

1024
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,570
-Yeah!
-All right! Good way to start, baby!

1025
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,155
Right.

1026
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,867
I mean, I ain't queer. No, I ain't.

1027
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,245
[sighs]

1028
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,457
Fastball.

1029
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:46,546
Stee!

1030
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:51,676
Ninety-six miles an hour. He looks good.
But why's he all twistin' up like that?

1031
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,595
He's using his parietal eye,
just like Fernando.

1032
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,056
Ooh, that was a humdinger.

1033
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,684
Come on.

1034
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,399
Fastball again? Why's he want the heat?
I just threw heat.

1035
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,944
Don't think, Meat. Just give him the gas.

1036
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,657
Out!

1037
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,036
Geez. What's got into Nuke?

1038
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:23,541
He's wearing garters, and he's breathing
out of his eyelids like a lava lizard.

1039
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,543
Old, uh, Mayan deal.

1040
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,545
-Aztec.
-Aztec deal.

1041
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,470
Got it! I got it!

1042
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,808
[Larry] Way to go! Way to go!

1043
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,397
-Had my mojo working!
-You nuked 'em!

1044
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,107
You know what a mojo is?

1045
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,151
-Sure.
-No, you don't.

1046
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,445
I was great, huh?

1047
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:56,157
Your fastball's up.
Your curveball's hanging.

1048
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,409
In the show, they would've ripped you.

1049
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,956
-Can't you even let me enjoy the moment?
-The moment's over.

1050
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,794
[woman on PA] Y'all, don't forget to try one
of Uncle Fred's yummy red hots while you're here.

1051
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,297
This guy starts me off
with a breaking ball. . .

1052
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,759
I'm taking him downtown.

1053
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,220
-He bad. He bad.
-[clamoring]

1054
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:25,102
I dare you to throw me the hammer.
You ain't that stupid.

1055
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:28,189
Stepping up to the plate for Durham,
our own Crash Davis.

1056
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,567
Come on, put your hands together for Crash.
Let's hear it!

1057
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:35,905
Let's go.

1058
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,867
[thinking] Come on, Meat.
Bring me that weak-ass shit, huh?

1059
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,870
Bring it. Bring it. Bring it.

1060
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,581
-[crack]
-[crowd cheers]

1061
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,001
Oh, my.

1062
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,924
[all] Whoo!

1063
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,180
2-nothing Bulls in the second.
First time the Bulls have been ahead in weeks.

1064
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:02,807
-Eh, Whitey?
-Mm-hmm.

1065
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,976
Let's see
if the real Nuke LaLoosh will show up.

1066
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,395
[crowd chanting] Bulls! Bulls!

1067
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,980
[sighs]

1068
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,408
Back! Back, back, back, back!

1069
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,660
-Room! You got room!
-Back!

1070
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,453
You got room!

1071
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,455
-[cheering]
-Out!

1072
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,463
What are you doing out here?
I'm cruising, man.

1073
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,174
I want you to throw the next one
at the mascot.

1074
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,385
Why? I'm finally throwing it
where I want to throw it.

1075
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,470
Just throw it at the bull, all right?

1076
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,139
Trust me.

1077
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,560
He's the boss.

1078
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:57,778
A staggering start by LaLoosh. He's thrown
five outs on nine pitches, all of 'em strikes.

1079
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:01,824
He's got pinpoint control here tonight,
Bull fans. Here's the pitch.

1080
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,330
-[groans]
-[crowd cheers]

1081
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,170
-This guy's crazy.
-Yep.

1082
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:18,007
I wouldn't dig in there if I was you.
Next one might be at your head.

1083
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,427
I don't know where it's gonna go.

1084
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,220
I swear to God.

1085
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,060
[chuckling menacingly]

1086
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,730
[chuckling continues]

1087
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,780
-[cheering]
-You're the man, Nuke. You're the man.

1088
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,490
Easy game. Easy game.

1089
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,619
[Garland] Top of the ninth, two outs.

1090
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,789
One out away from a stunning
two-hit shutout for LaLoosh.

1091
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,709
Bear down, Meat. Don't let up.

1092
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,087
You own these guys.

1093
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,673
Dad would love a shutout.

1094
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,222
Oh, no, no, no. No.

1095
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:11,060
No, no. He's looking for heat.

1096
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,895
Let me give him the deuce.

1097
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,314
[woman] Play ball!

1098
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:20,194
Oh, no, he's shaking off the signs.
Big mistake.

1099
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,823
This son of a bitch is throwing
a two-hit shutout, he's shaking me off.

1100
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,366
You believe that shit?

1101
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,413
Charlie, here comes the deuce.

1102
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:33,040
And when you speak of me, speak well.

1103
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,173
-No, no, serve it up.
-Yeah.

1104
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,013
[crowd gasping]

1105
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:52,435
[woman on PA] Home run, Jimmy Powell.

1106
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,854
Give me the ball.

1107
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,612
You told him I was gonna
throw a deuce, right?

1108
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:05,114
Yep.

1109
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,701
Man, that ball got out of here in a hurry.

1110
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:14,457
Anything that travels that far ought to have
a damn stewardess on it, don't you think?

1111
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,669
[man] Let's go!

1112
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,344
[soundtrack: rock]

1113
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,767
[cheering]

1114
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,693
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1115
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,325
Yeah!

1116
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,202
[cheering]

1117
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:55,122
[Annie] When Nuke started listening
to Crash, everything fell into place.

1118
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:58,417
He started throwing strikes,
and we started to win.

1119
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,753
But Nuke was still confused.

1120
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:05,716
He was so encouraged by his victory
that he vowed not to have sex until he lost.

1121
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,970
Unfortunately, however, he kept on winning,
and for one extraordinary June and July,

1122
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:15,726
the Durham Bulls began playing baseball
with joy and verve and poetry.

1123
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:20,397
The two sides of my own brain
were all jumbled up and cross-wired.

1124
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,358
While one side was being neglected,

1125
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:26,153
the other was in paradise
watching our Bulls play like big-leaguers.

1126
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:30,115
We swept a four-game series at Kinston,
two games at Winston-Salem,

1127
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,744
and kicked the holy shit out of Greensboro
in a three-game set.

1128
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,915
And Crash, who kept hitting dingers,
was approaching the minor league record,

1129
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,084
though I told nobody.

1130
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:46,507
After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader,
the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

1131
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,803
Beautiful as the winning streak was,
I was gettin' damn lonely.

1132
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,180
Something had to be done.

1133
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:55,099
I needed a man.

1134
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,059
Yeah!

1135
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,522
-Nuke!
-Hey, Jimmy, how you doin'?

1136
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,857
[shouts]

1137
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,069
Yeah! I love winning, man.

1138
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,655
I fuckin' love winning.

1139
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,282
You hear what I'm saying?

1140
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,409
It's, like, better than losing?

1141
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,371
Teach me something new, man.
I need to learn.

1142
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,373
Teach me something.

1143
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,752
[Crash] You got something to write with?
Good. It's time to work on your interviews.

1144
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,005
[Nuke] My interviews? What do I gotta do?

1145
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,173
You're gonna have to learn your clichés.

1146
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:31,760
You're gonna have to study them.
You're gonna have to know them.

1147
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,763
They're your friends. Write this down.

1148
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,392
"We got to play 'em one day at a time."

1149
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:42,271
". . . got to play. . . "
That's pretty boring, you know.

1150
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,773
Of course it's boring. That's the point.
Write it down.

1151
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:48,152
". . . one day at a time."

1152
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,113
All right. "I'm just happy to be here.

1153
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,866
Hope I can help the ball club."

1154
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,744
I know. Write it down.

1155
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:01,582
"I just want to give it my best shot,

1156
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,836
and the good Lord willing,
things will work out."

1157
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,299
". . . good Lord willing,

1158
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,052
-things will work out."
-"Things will work out." Yep.

1159
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,637
How's Annie?

1160
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,601
She's getting pretty steamed actually

1161
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,896
'cause I'm still rechanneling
my sexual energy.

1162
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,069
I'm figuring I'm just gonna cave in
and sleep with her, you know,

1163
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,695
to calm her down.

1164
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,239
-Are you out of your mind?
-I'm just –

1165
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,492
-Are you out of your mind?
-Just talking about one time.

1166
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,995
If you give in now,
you might start losing. Huh?

1167
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:47,002
Never fuck with a winning streak.

1168
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,215
[horn honking]

1169
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,593
[Annie] Hi, boys.

1170
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,805
Hi, darlin'. Get in here, you sweet thing.

1171
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,598
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Hey, Millie.

1172
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,475
Want a ride?

1173
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:06,063
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

1174
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,357
No.

1175
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,901
Can I give you my testimony?

1176
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:14,238
You can do anything you want.

1177
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,452
Hop in.

1178
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:23,372
[giggles]

1179
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,917
I am so proud of you guys.

1180
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,092
-You want some more soup, honey?
-Oh, no, thanks. That was good.

1181
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,433
How about a little, um, back rub?

1182
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:46,186
No, I'm-I'm okay.
I think I'm gonna just take a little nap.

1183
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,191
-You want me to tuck you in?
-Annie. Annie, you can't seduce me.

1184
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:55,571
[laughs] Sweetie,
I'm not gonna try to seduce you.

1185
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:01,118
-What's that?
-That's my leg.

1186
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,786
[chuckles] I know what it is.

1187
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:05,456
I just thought maybe we could
work on some fundamentals,

1188
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,543
since we're not gonna make love, and kind of. . .
improve your hand-eye coordination.

1189
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:13,422
-[chuckles] My hand-eye coordination?
-Mm-hmm. Unsnap my stocking.

1190
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:19,178
The other day, Crash called a woman's pu –

1191
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,096
pussy, um. . .

1192
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,600
Well, you know how the hair
is kind of in a "V" shape?

1193
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,271
-Yes, I do.
-Well, he called it the Bermuda Triangle.

1194
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,566
He said that a man can get lost in there
and never be heard from again.

1195
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,069
-What a nasty thing to say.
-Oh, no, no. He didn't mean it nasty.

1196
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:41,992
He – He said that getting lost
and disappearing from the face of the earth

1197
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:45,996
was sometimes a good thing to do,
especially like that.

1198
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,417
But he also said that there are times
for discipline,

1199
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:53,962
and-and self-control,
and I think this is one of those times.

1200
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,507
Well, Crash is a very smart man.

1201
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,510
Now, honey, let's give it a try.

1202
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,725
Here, wait a minute. Watch. Watch.

1203
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,608
Now you try it. Go ahead.

1204
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,449
Mm-hmm.

1205
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,036
Yep.

1206
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,790
Mmm. Yeah. That's it.

1207
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,169
-You're playing with my mind.
-I'm trying to play with your body.

1208
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,798
-I knew it. You're trying to seduce me.
-Of course I'm trying to seduce you, for God's sake.

1209
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,467
I'm doing a damn poor job of it.
Aren't I pretty?

1210
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:44,346
-Oh, God, I think you're real cute.
-Cute?

1211
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:47,391
Baby ducks are cute. I hate cute!

1212
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:50,561
I want to be exotic and mysterious.

1213
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:54,481
You are.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute and –

1214
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,734
That's why I'd better leave.

1215
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:59,736
Nuke, you got it all wrong!

1216
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,365
There's no relationship
between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.

1217
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,701
-I did.
-And what did he say?

1218
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,287
He said if I give in to you,
I'll start losing again.

1219
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,248
-He did?
-Yeah.

1220
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,501
I'll be back when we lose.

1221
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,050
Damn it. [grunts]

1222
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,597
[muttering]

1223
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:30,934
[footsteps approaching]

1224
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,275
How dare you tell Nuke
to stay out of my bed!

1225
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,028
You are messing with my private life!

1226
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,614
Knock, knock. You know? "Come in."

1227
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,574
-You're confusing him.
-Where's "Thank you"?

1228
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,910
-You're bending his mind all out of shape.
-I'm what?

1229
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,495
-You're confusing him.
-I'm confusing him?

1230
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,873
You got him breathing
out of the wrong goddamn eyelid.

1231
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,167
You got him parading around
the locker room like a fruit.

1232
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:59,254
That is a religious ritual, and it happens
to be working, if you don't mind my saying.

1233
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,798
Wait a second. Who dresses you?

1234
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,342
-What?
-Who dresses you?

1235
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,470
Don't you think this is a little excessive
for the Carolina League?

1236
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:10,474
"The road of excess leads
to the palace of wisdom." William Blake.

1237
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,225
-William Blake?
-William Blake.

1238
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,436
-William Blake?
-William Blake!

1239
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,105
-What do you mean, William Blake?
-I mean William Blake!

1240
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:23,236
Who are you? I mean, do you have a job?

1241
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:26,531
I teach part-time
at Alamance Junior College.

1242
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,284
English 101 and Beginning Composition!

1243
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:33,288
You know,
having a conversation with you is like –

1244
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,917
-is like a Martian talking to a fungo.
-Oh, cute.

1245
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:40,504
Just because sometimes you manage
to be clever and you have a nice smile

1246
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:42,464
does not mean you are not full of shit.

1247
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,508
-What, I'm full of shit?
-You're full of shit.

1248
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:47,177
-You are full of shit!
-Nuke's chastity was your idea.

1249
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,887
I know. I'm telling you –

1250
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:52,349
-I never told him to stay out of your bed.
-Yes, you did. You most certainly did.

1251
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,434
-I never told him to stay out of your bed.
-Yes, you did.

1252
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,021
I told him that a player on a streak
has to respect the streak.

1253
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,314
-Fine.
-You know why?

1254
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,316
-'Cause they don't happen very often.
-Right.

1255
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,860
If you believe you're playing well
because you're getting laid

1256
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:07,322
or because you're not getting laid
or because you wear women's underwear,

1257
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:08,949
then you are!

1258
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,575
And you should know that.

1259
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,458
Come on, Annie.
Think of something clever to say, huh?

1260
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,339
Something full of magic
and religion bullshit.

1261
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,551
Come on, dazzle me.

1262
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:31,555
[quietly] I want you.

1263
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,765
What?

1264
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,977
-I said I want you.
-Stop it.

1265
01:12:43,151 --> 01:12:44,901
You're scared.

1266
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,533
Maybe I am.

1267
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,911
But I still think you should leave.

1268
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,913
[chuckles]

1269
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,916
Okay, well,

1270
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:03,086
this is the damnedest season
I've ever seen.

1271
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,548
I mean, the Durham Bulls can't lose,
and I can't get laid!

1272
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,428
Damn!

1273
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,765
[Larry] Come on, Nuke!
Show 'em what you got. Super rook!

1274
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,726
Show 'em your super rook!
Super Nuke! Super Nuke!

1275
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,229
LaLoosh! LA Loosh!
Come on, LaLoosh! LA Loosh! LA Loosh!

1276
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:25,150
-[crowd groans]
-Just relax out there. Don't aim the ball.

1277
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:26,985
Damn.

1278
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,364
Nuke's overthrowing tonight.
Don't look loose.

1279
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,366
Anything bothering him?

1280
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:37,913
He says his chakras are jammed. He's having
trouble breathing out of his, uh, left eyelid?

1281
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,456
-Right eyelid.
-Right eyelid.

1282
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,546
-[crowd groans]
-Jack, give me the ball.

1283
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,090
Fuck!

1284
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,429
-Time out!
-[woman on PA] Up to the plate, Junior Shockley.

1285
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,014
What's wrong?

1286
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,225
I'm a little nervous. My old man's here.

1287
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,644
Your dad's here? Where's he at?

1288
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,189
He's right behind home plate.
Don't look. Don't look. Shit.

1289
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,943
Look, he's waving.

1290
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,821
Hey, he's just your old man.
He's as full of shit as anybody.

1291
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,615
-Hey, what's going on?
-Breathing through the wrong fuckin' eyelid again?

1292
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,326
-Shut up.
-Did you guys hear about Jimmy and Millie?

1293
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,538
-Yep.
-They got engaged! Can you believe that?

1294
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,707
Oh, yeah? Wait till I tell him
she's gone down on half the Carolina League.

1295
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,002
Hey, anybody says anything bad about Millie,
I break his neck.

1296
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,004
Excuse me, guys,
I got a game to pitch here.

1297
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:31,550
-José.
-[speaking Spanish]

1298
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,178
Hey, you guys. Don't throw me anything.
My girlfriend put a curse on my glove.

1299
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:37,597
I'll take the hex off the fuckin' glove.
Give me the glove.

1300
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,516
You gotta cut the head off a live rooster.

1301
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,395
-[man] Come on! Play ball!
-[chattering]

1302
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,897
What the hell's going on out there?

1303
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,692
Looks like a convention.
Pretty soon they ought to call the roll.

1304
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,694
[laughing]

1305
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,488
-Get your ass out there and check it out.
-You bet.

1306
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,078
-[man] Let's play some baseball!
-[woman] Hurry up!

1307
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,999
Excuse me.
What the hell's going on out here?

1308
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:09,171
Well, Nuke's scared 'cause
his eyelids are jammed and his old man's here.

1309
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,673
We need a live – Was it a live rooster?

1310
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,301
We need a live rooster
to take the curse off José's glove.

1311
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:18,471
And nobody seems to know what to get
Millie or Jimmy for their wedding present.

1312
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,890
-That about right?
-That's right.

1313
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,474
We're dealing with a lot of shit.

1314
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,604
Okay, well, uh,
candlesticks always make a nice gift,

1315
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,939
and maybe you could find out
where she's registered.

1316
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,692
Maybe a place setting
or maybe a silverware pattern's good.

1317
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,861
Okay, let's get two. Here we go.

1318
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,121
[Garland on radio]
LaLoosh looks in for the sign. Here's the pitch.

1319
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:45,999
Ball hit deep into right field,
off the wall.

1320
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:49,461
-You should be at the game, Annie.
-Mm-mmm. I'm fine.

1321
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,465
Beautiful night for baseball here in Durham,
and as the batter steps in –

1322
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:59,971
How much time did you and Jimmy
spend together before he proposed?

1323
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,265
About five hours, I guess.

1324
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,809
-We both just knew.
-Hmm.

1325
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,270
Annie. . .

1326
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,565
do you think I deserve to wear white?

1327
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,778
-Honey, we all deserve to wear white.
-Ball 2, in the dirt.

1328
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,613
[Larry] Come on, Nuke! Go get him!

1329
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,784
-[crowd groans]
-Shit! Piss! Fuck!

1330
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:22,494
Right! Right! Right!

1331
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,287
Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

1332
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,372
Come on!

1333
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:28,959
He's gonna go home! Home! Home!
We got him! Got him!

1334
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,254
-Safe!
-No! No! I got him!

1335

[Annie] Walt Whitman once said,
