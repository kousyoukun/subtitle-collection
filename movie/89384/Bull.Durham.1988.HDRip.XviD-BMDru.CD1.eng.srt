1
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,085
<i>I believe in</i>
<i>the Church of Baseball.</i>

2
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,588
<i>I've tried all the major religions</i>
<i>and most of the minor ones.</i>

3
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,854
<i>I've worshipped Buddha,</i>
<i>Allah, Brahma, Vishnu...</i>

4
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:19,328
<i>Siva, trees, mushrooms</i>
<i>and Isadora Duncan.</i>

5
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,597
<i>I know things.</i>

6
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,863
<i>For instance, there are 108 beads</i>
<i>in a Catholic rosary...</i>

7
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,996
<i>and there are 108 stitches</i>
<i>in a baseball.</i>

8
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:30,574
<i>When I learned that,</i>
<i>I gaveJesus a chance.</i>

9
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,040
<i>But it just didn't work out</i>
<i>between us.</i>

10
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:36,546
<i>The Lord laid</i>
<i>too much guilt on me.</i>

11
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:39,945
<i>I prefer metaphysics</i>
<i>to theology.</i>

12
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,076
<i>You see, there's no guilt</i>
<i>in baseball...</i>

13
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,814
<i>and it's never boring...</i>

14
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:45,913
<i>which makes it like sex.</i>

15
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,018
<i>There's never been a ballplayer</i>
<i>who slept with me...</i>

16
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:51,391
<i>who didn't have</i>
<i>the best year of his career.</i>

17
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:55,191
<i>Making love</i>
<i>is like hitting a baseball...</i>

18
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,598
<i>you just gotta relax</i>
<i>and concentrate.</i>

19
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,904
<i>Besides, I'd never sleep</i>
<i>with a player hitting under.250...</i>

20
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:05,966
<i>unless he had a lot of RBI's or was</i>
<i>a great glove man up the middle.</i>

21
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:12,410
<i>You see, there's a certain amount</i>
<i>of life wisdom I give these boys.</i>

22
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:14,747
<i>I can expand their minds.</i>

23
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,753
<i>Sometimes when I've got</i>
<i>a ballplayer alone...</i>

24
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:20,120
<i>I'll just read Emily Dickinson</i>
<i>or Walt Whitman to him.</i>

25
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,955
<i>And the guys are so sweet,</i>
<i>they always stay and listen.</i>

26
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,889
<i>Of course, a guy will listen</i>
<i>to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.</i>

27
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,362
<i>I make them feel confident,</i>
<i>and they make me feel safe...</i>

28
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,130
<i>and pretty.</i>

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,970
<i>Of course, what I give them</i>
<i>lasts a lifetime.</i>

30
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:41,170
<i>What they give me</i>
<i>lasts 142 games.</i>

31
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:44,339
<i>Sometimes it seems</i>
<i>like a bad trade...</i>

32
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,610
<i>but bad trades</i>
<i>is a part of baseball.</i>

33
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:50,779
<i>Who can forget Frank Robinson</i>
<i>for Milt Pappas, for God's sake?</i>

34
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,915
<i>It's a long season,</i>
<i>and you gotta trust it.</i>

35
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,925
<i>I've tried 'em all,</i>
<i>I really have.</i>

36
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:58,723
<i>And the only church</i>
<i>that truly feeds the soul...</i>

37
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,357
<i>day in, day out...</i>
<i>is the Church of Baseball.</i>

38
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,935
Hey, Skip, that Max,
hell of a guy.

39
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:43,701
Where's Ebby?

40
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,833
Ain't he warming up yet?

41
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:49,380
No. His professional debut tonight,
and he forgets about it.

42
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,642
Better find our "bonus baby."

43
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,539
Have you seen Ebby?

44
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,244
No.

45
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:05,355
Ebby!

46
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,592
Jesus.

47
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:13,159
Game starts in four minutes.
Why ain't you warm?

48
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,102
I am warm.

49
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:17,640
Jesus, this is your
professional debut tonight.

50
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:20,802
Million guys give their left nut
to be in your shoes.

51
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,813
You're leaving your fastball in
the locker room for some piece of ass.

52
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,042
Skip, it is me.

53
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:30,178
I am not some, quote,
piece of ass, unquote.

54
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,114
Oh, Millie.

55
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,920
Jeez, sorry.
Didn't recognize you.

56
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,396
Don't take this personally, Millie,
but if I catch you in here again...

57
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,227
you're banned from the ballpark.

58
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,302
You can't ban me
from the ballpark...

59
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,427
'cause my daddy
donated that scoreboard.

60
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,735
And if you ban me, he just might
take that scoreboard away.

61
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,036
What do we need
a scoreboard for?

62
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,304
We ain't scored any runs
all year.

63
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:56,744
Now you get your ass out there!

64
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,440
Hey, boss, I got a question.

65
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,177
What?

66
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,719
You think I need a nickname?
I think I need a nickname.

67
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,880
We were talking about it.
All the great ones have nicknames.

68
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,254
Like "Oil Can," "Catfish."
What was the one you were...

69
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,451
"Pokey."

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,323
What do you think of"Pokey"?

71
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:12,988
You got three minutes.

72
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,828
Goddamn, son of a bitchin',
motherfuckin' shithead!

73
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,959
Time for another quickie.

74
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,232
Jesus, you got
a game to pitch.

75
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:23,364
We got three minutes.

76
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:37,346
<i>Come on, folks.</i>
<i>Let's hear it for Max Patkin...</i>

77
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:39,514
<i>the clown prince of baseball.</i>

78
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:41,615
You gonna sit there all day?

79
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,853
<i>And now</i>
<i>"The Greatest Show on Dirt"...</i>

80
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,897
<i>your own Durham Bulls!</i>

81
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:54,534
I'm there. I'm ready.

82
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,171
<i>And now WRDU radio presents...</i>

83
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,747
<i>the voice of the Durham Bulls,</i>
<i>Teddy Garland.</i>

84
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:06,578
The Bulls off to a slow start,
having dropped their first three games.

85
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:09,380
But hope to turn it around tonight
with the professional debut...

86
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:13,321
<i>of heralded young pitcher,</i>
<i>Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.</i>

87
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:18,261
Millie, you gotta stay out
of the clubhouse.

88
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,853
You're gonna get everybody
in trouble.

89
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,795
I got lured.

90
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,993
You did not get lured.
Women do not get lured.

91
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:26,195
They are too strong and powerful
for that. Now say it...

92
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:29,239
"I did not get lured. I accept
full responsibility for my actions."

93
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,673
"I did not get lured. I accept
full responsibility for my actions."

94
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:36,508
That's better.
You got your radar ready?

95
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:38,445
- Ready.
- Go to it.

96
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:41,710
Steppin' in
for the Peninsula White Sox...

97
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,754
is leadoff hitter Willie Foster.

98
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,914
<i>Word on LaLoosh is that</i>
<i>the good-looking, young pitcher...</i>

99
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:49,619
<i>has a major-league fastball, but</i>
<i>sometimes has problems with control.</i>

100
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:06,474
Damn.

101
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:09,308
One ball, no strikes
to Willie Foster.

102
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:16,410
No problem!

103
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,580
Go get 'em, one, two, three, babe.
Get 'em, big guy.

104
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,489
Ninety-five miles an hour.

105
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:25,085
That's great.
He looks just great.

106
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:35,904
<i>Stepping in</i>
<i>for the Peninsula White Sox...</i>

107
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,271
<i>second baseman Allen Powley.</i>

108
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,570
What's it say?

109
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:43,135
It says he's not bending his back
on his follow-through.

110
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:48,013
Scotty, baby, take this
to Ebby Calvin.

111
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:53,547
All right, let's get down to it.
How was Ebby Calvin LaLoosh?

112
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:56,126
Well, he fucks
like he pitches.

113
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,855
Sort of all over the place.

114
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,650
My!

115
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,662
He walked 18.

116
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,827
A new league record.

117
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:43,066
- Struck out 18.
- Another new league record.

118
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,369
In addition, he hit
the sportswriter...

119
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:48,707
the public address announcer,
the Bull mascot twice.

120
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:51,509
Also, new league records.

121
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,351
But, Joe...

122
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,616
this guy's got
some serious shit.

123
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:01,749
Yeah, serious shit.

124
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,699
Who are you?
Who's he?

125
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,270
I'm "the player
to be named later."

126
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:16,534
Crash Davis?
I'm Joe Riggins.

127
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:20,106
And you, Larry Hockett,
should recognize me...

128
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:23,271
'cause five years ago
in the Texas League...

129
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:26,282
you were pitching for El Paso,
I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport.

130
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:29,785
You hung a curveball
on an 0-2 pitch in a 3-2 game...

131
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:33,983
in the bottom of the eighth,
and I tattooed it...

132
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,686
over the Michelin Tire sign,
beat you 4-3.

133
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,694
I remember. I should have
thrown a slider.

134
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,354
Damn, Crash, how ya doin?

135
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,729
I'm too old for this shit.

136
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:46,035
Why in the hell
am I back in A ball?

137
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:49,504
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

138
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,336
Big club's got
a hundred grand in him.

139
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:54,070
He's got a million-dollar arm
with a five-cent head.

140
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,811
Had a gun on him tonight.

141
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:59,883
Last five pitches he threw
were faster than the first five.

142
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:03,913
He's got the best young arm
I've seen in 30 years.

143
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,683
You've been around.

144
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,088
You're smart.
You're a professional.

145
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,093
We want you to mature the kid.

146
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,062
We want you to room with him
on the road.

147
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:17,657
Stay on his case all year.
He can go all the way.

148
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:21,233
Yeah? Where can I go?

149
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:22,829
You can keep going
to the ballpark...

150
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,636
keep getting paid to do it.

151
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,574
Beats the hell out of
working at Sears.

152
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,013
Sears sucks. I once worked there.
Sold Lady Kenmores.

153
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,811
Nasty work.

154
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,853
Even if it is
the Carolina League...

155
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,785
this is a chance
to play every day.

156
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,120
You don't want a player.
You want a stable pony.

157
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,089
No.

158
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:44,093
My triple A contract
gets bought out...

159
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:46,595
so I can hold the flavor
of the month's dick.

160
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,531
Is that it?
Fuck this fucking game!

161
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:00,970
I fuckin' quit, all right?

162
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:21,730
Who we play tomorrow?

163
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,132
Winston-Salem.
Batting practice, 11:30.

164
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:31,668
How's it feel to get
your first professional win?

165
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:35,303
It feels out there.
It's a major rush.

166
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:39,509
It doesn't just feel out there,
it feels out there.

167
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:42,415
Kind of radical
in a kind of tubular way.

168
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,249
But most of all,
it's out there.

169
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:48,689
This is hopeless.
This is utterly, fucking hopeless.

170
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,072
Hey, I'm Millie.

171
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,171
I'm Tony.
I play second base.

172
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:07,335
I know.

173
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,477
How do you just keep
coming back every year?

174
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,780
'Cause I love the game, Annie.
I love it.

175
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,946
- Here you go.
- We didn't order these.

176
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,852
- He did.
- Who?

177
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,788
The guy in the booth.

178
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:26,421
Who's that?

179
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:31,065
That's Crash Davis.
Hey, Crash, come here.

180
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,602
Get over here.

181
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:36,406
He's kinda cute.

182
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,032
He's played in more ballparks
than I have.

183
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:40,474
Hell of a guy.

184
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,569
He's really different.

185
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,740
I actually saw him read a book
without pictures once.

186
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,947
- Hi, Max.
- How you doing?

187
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:53,580
Come over and sit down.

188
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,591
I'm Crash.

189
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,821
Annie Savoy.
Wanna dance?

190
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,397
I don't dance.

191
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,659
How embarrassing.

192
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,998
What is that?

193
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,648
Who's he dancing with?

194
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,948
All of them, I think.

195
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:40,565
You Annie Savoy?

196
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,639
Thanks for your note. You're right.
I wasn't bending my back.

197
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,469
You have a live arm there.

198
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,440
Thanks.

199
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,944
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

200
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,673
You need a nickname, honey.

201
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:52,772
I've been telling
everybody that.

202
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:56,552
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:58,485
She's dancing with me.

204
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,716
'Fraid not, pal.

205
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,623
You boys gonna fight
over little ol' me?

206
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,527
- No.
- Let's go.

207
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,567
Step outside and party, man.

208
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,895
Don't be such guys.

209
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,838
Max, let's dance.

210
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,683
You comin' or not, homeboy?

211
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:44,424
Let's go. Come on.
We're waitin'.

212
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:47,060
- Let's go, homeboy.
- Come on, Ebby. There he is.

213
00:14:56,747 --> 00:15:00,012
I don't believe in fighting.
Let's just...

214
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:05,249
That's really sweet.
Fuck you, you pussy.

215
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:11,391
All right.
Take the first shot at me.

216
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,929
No way.
I don't hit no man first.

217
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,101
All right, then.

218
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,696
Hit me in the chest
with that.

219
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,536
I'd kill you.

220
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:30,170
From what I hear,
you couldn't hit water...

221
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,306
if you fell out of
a fuckin' boat.

222
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:38,282
Go ahead, man.

223
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:41,153
Go ahead, come on.
Right in the chest.

224
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:43,488
- No way.
- Come on, Meat.

225
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,392
You're not gonna hit me 'cause
you're thinking about it already.

226
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,932
Starting to think
how embarrassing it would be...

227
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:52,969
to miss in front of these people,
how somebody might laugh.

228
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,735
Come on, Rook.
Show us that million-dollar arm...

229
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,471
'cause I got a good idea
about that five-cent head of yours.

230
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:02,978
Hit 'im, man!

231
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:08,908
Fuck!

232
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:12,248
Ball four.

233
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,654
Who the fuck are you?

234
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,761
Good punch.

235
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,766
I'm Crash Davis.
I'm your new catcher...

236
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:26,701
and you just got
lesson number one:

237
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:27,862
Don't think.

238
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,963
It can only hurt the ball club.

239
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,380
Come inside,
I'll buy you a drink.

240
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,187
He's my new catcher.

241
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:01,468
We fight, she gets the clown.
How's that happen?

242
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,570
God, I like this song.

243
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:19,580
Did you boys stop fightin'?

244
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,214
Pals now?

245
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,418
That's good.

246
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:26,792
I love a little
macho male bonding.

247
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:28,831
I think it's sweet.
I do.

248
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,868
Even if it probably is latent
homosexuality being rechanneled.

249
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,233
I'm all for rechanneling,
so who cares, right?

250
00:17:39,577 --> 00:17:41,670
Okay, shall we go to my place?

251
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:45,448
Which one of us?

252
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,540
Both of you, of course.

253
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,122
These are the ground rules.

254
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:27,815
I hook up with one guy a season.

255
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:30,359
Usually takes me a couple weeks
to pick the guy.

256
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,622
Kind of my own spring training.

257
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,360
You two are the most promising
prospects of the season so far.

258
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,832
I just thought we should kinda
get to know each other.

259
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:45,307
Time-out.
Why do you get to choose?

260
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,673
- Why?
- Why do you get to choose?

261
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:50,747
Why don't I get to choose?
Why doesn't he get to choose?

262
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:54,944
Actually, nobody on this planet
ever really chooses each other.

263
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,316
It's all a question
of quantum physics...

264
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,321
molecular attraction
and timing.

265
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:02,256
Laws we don't understand that
bring us together and tear us apart.

266
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:05,495
It's like pheromones.

267
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:08,326
You get three ants together,
they can't do dick.

268
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,959
You get 300 million of them,
they can build a cathedral.

269
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,439
Is somebody gonna go to bed
with somebody?

270
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,873
Honey, you are a regular
nuclear meltdown.

271
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,672
You better cool off.

272
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:26,743
Where you going?

273
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,877
After 12 years in the minor leagues,
I don't try out.

274
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,682
Besides...

275
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,883
I don't believe in quantum physics
when it comes to matters of the heart.

276
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:38,356
What do you believe in, then?

277
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:41,056
I believe in the soul...

278
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,759
the cock, the pussy...

279
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,893
the small of a woman's back...

280
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:48,870
the hanging curveball,
high-fiver, good scotch...

281
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:52,465
that the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent, overrated crap.

282
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:54,635
I believe Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone.

283
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,940
I believe there oughta be
a constitutional amendment...

284
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,311
outlawing Astroturf
and the designated hitter.

285
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,351
I believe in the sweet spot,
soft-core pornography...

286
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:05,047
open your presents Christmas morning
rather than Christmas Eve...

287
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:08,181
and I believe in long, slow,
deep, soft, wet kisses...

288
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,850
that last three days.

289
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,725
Good night.

290
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,093
Oh, my.

291
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:20,028
Hey, what's all
this molecule stuff?

292
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:23,765
Crash, wait!

293
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,398
All's I want is a date.

294
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:27,739
I'm not gonna fall in love
with you or nothing.

295
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:31,372
I'm not interested in a woman
who's interested in that boy.

296
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,608
Good night.

297
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:35,082
- I'm not interested yet.
- Who you calling a boy?

298
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:36,777
See you at the yard, Meat.

299
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:40,379
Damn, nobody's ever said no
to a date with me before.

300
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:42,288
He's crazy.

301
00:20:42,393 --> 00:20:43,917
I want you bad.

302
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,735
Honey, hold on.
Slow down.

303
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,034
I wanna watch.

304
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:03,303
Go ahead.
Put it back on.

305
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:06,979
Jesus, what kind
of chick are you?

306
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,417
When you know how to make love,
then you'll know how to pitch.

307
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,785
I know how to pitch.

308
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,326
Good.

309
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:20,625
Now take it off slowly.

310
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,772
That's nice.

311
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,820
Oh, my, what a nice back.

312
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:50,320
Honey. Sweetheart.

313
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:52,987
Try taking off
your shoes and socks first.

314
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:55,622
My socks?
It's cold in here.

315
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,425
What?

316
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:00,765
You think Dwight Gooden
leaves his socks on?

317
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,735
Ebby, honey.

318
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:39,808
Have you ever been
tied up in bed?

319
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,499
Bring it on, baby!

320
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,668
I heard about shit like this.

321
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:16,712
You ever heard
about Walt Whitman?

322
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:17,940
Who's he play for?

323
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,448
He sort of pitches
for the Cosmic All-Stars.

324
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:22,781
- Never heard of him.
- Oh, good.

325
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,114
Listen to this.

326
00:23:27,357 --> 00:23:29,587
"I sing the body electric.

327
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:33,527
The armies of those I love
engirth me and I engirth them.

328
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,224
They will not let me off
till I go with them...

329
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,301
respond to them
and discorrupt them...

330
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:41,428
and charge them full
with the charge of the soul.

331
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:49,338
But the expression of a well-made man
appears not only in his face...

332
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:52,142
it is in his limbs
and joints also."

333
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:57,209
Excuse me.
Are we gonna fuck or what?

334
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,559
"It is curiously in the joints
of his hips and wrists.

335
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:08,119
Love flesh swelling
and deliciously aching.

336
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:13,431
Limitless limpid jets of love,
hot and enormous."

337
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:23,975
Listen up, guys.
Can I have your attention a minute?

338
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,311
I'm gonna be leading a daily chapel
service here in the locker room...

339
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,748
- at 3:00 in the afternoon.
- Amen, brother!

340
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:32,117
Y'all are invited to stop on by
and worship before batting practice.

341
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:35,020
Jimmy, goddamn it.
Loosen up and get laid.

342
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:40,694
I know y'all think
I'm pretty square, but...

343
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:42,355
I believe what I believe.

344
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:49,064
Jesus, Ebby, you look like
a truck ran over you.

345
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,875
Nuke. Call me Nuke.

346
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:56,739
Annie says
it's my new nickname.

347
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,441
Okay, Nuke. Go get 'em.

348
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,313
Annie nailed you?
Annie did?

349
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,648
That's great. That means
you're gonna have a great year.

350
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:08,088
Is she as good as they say?

351
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,993
No, man, we didn't fuck.

352
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:16,495
No, she read poetry
to me all night.

353
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,830
It's more tiring than fucking.

354
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,268
"Limpid jets of love."

355
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:32,204
Hey, Crash. Does that mean
what I think it means?

356
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:34,045
"Limpid jets of love."

357
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:36,551
Your shower shoes
have fungus on them.

358
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:40,851
You'll never make it to the bigs
with fungus on your shower shoes.

359
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,620
Think classy,
you'll be classy.

360
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:45,354
If you win 20 in the Show...

361
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,896
you can let the fungus
grow back on your shower shoes...

362
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:49,989
and the press will think
you're colorful.

363
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,933
Until you win 20
in the Show, however...

364
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:55,732
means you're a slob.

365
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:03,372
<i>Y'all don't forget</i>
<i>Saturday is Bull Day...</i>

366
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,209
<i>down at the Northgate Mall.</i>

367
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,476
Strike!

368
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:09,518
<i>Whoa, too bad, Butch.</i>

369
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:13,855
Charge!

370
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:17,820
Not getting that cheese
by me, Meat.

371
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:22,092
<i>And now batting for the Bulls,</i>
<i>number eight, Crash Davis.</i>

372
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:33,740
Foul ball!

373
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:36,404
God, stupid fuck, Crash.

374
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,413
What'd you swing
at a breaking ball for?

375
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,607
Fuck me.

376
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,853
You usually start me off
with a hammer.

377
00:26:46,957 --> 00:26:50,791
<i>You're thinking too much, Crash.</i>
<i>Get out of your fuckin'head.</i>

378
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,794
<i>Don't let him in your kitchen.</i>

379
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:56,559
Come on, Crash. Just relax.
You got it, honey.

380
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,568
<i>All right, here we go.</i>
<i>Stay back. Relax.</i>

381
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,069
<i>Quick bat.</i>

382
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,399
Foul ball!

383
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:11,573
Throw that shit again, Meat.
Throw that weak-ass shit again.

384
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:16,279
Okay, get close.
You got it. One more, baby.

385
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,850
<i>He's gonna throw the deuce now.</i>

386
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,583
<i>He's gotta waste one.</i>

387
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:25,253
<i>Stay back and wipe that</i>
<i>silly grin off his face.</i>

388
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:27,956
<i>Come on. Bring it.</i>

389
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:29,791
Jesus Christ!

390
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,800
What the hell was that?

391
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,665
What goes around,
comes around.

392
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,601
Son of a bitch throws hard.

393
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:40,337
It's okay, Crash.
You take it easy, honey.

394
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:46,847
<i>All right, one and two.</i>
<i>You can eat this shit. Relax.</i>

395
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,646
<i>Annie.</i>

396
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,550
<i>Who's this Annie?</i>

397
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:54,351
<i>Jesus, get out of the box, idiot.</i>
<i>Where's your head?</i>

398
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,358
<i>Get the broad</i>
<i>outta your head!</i>

399
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,552
Time-out!

400
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:01,888
Give me a rag.

401
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,998
Get a hit, Crash.

402
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,130
Shut up.

403
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:19,572
All right, you've seen
all his pitches.

404
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:21,378
You've seen them all.

405
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:25,785
<i>Shorten up, Crash.</i>
<i>Bring me the gas, kid.</i>

406
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,360
<i>Quick bat.</i>

407
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:34,557
Strike!

408
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,603
Scotty, baby,
take this to Crash.

409
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,173
<i>Folks, we have</i>
<i>a little lost girl up here.</i>

410
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:50,974
<i>Says her name is Lana Ann Baker.</i>

411
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:52,981
<i>- She'll be waiting...</i>
- It's for Crash.

412
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,210
<i>at the ticket box</i>
<i>for her daddy, Cedar Baker.</i>

413
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:57,377
<i>Cedar, come get</i>
<i>your little girl.</i>

414
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,978
- What?
- From Annie.

415
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,182
Read it.

416
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:07,656
"Dear Crash, you have
a lovely swing...

417
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:10,358
but you're pulling
your hips out too early.

418
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:14,130
I'd be happy to meet you tomorrow
at the batting cage to discuss it.

419
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:15,795
Signed, Annie."

420
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:19,375
If there's one chick who'd know
you were pulling your hips out early...

421
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,704
it'd be Annie.

422
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,352
It's kind of a personal note, kid,
so don't read it.

423
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:33,480
There you go.

424
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:44,266
Here, Millie.

425
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,834
What's it say?

426
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:51,135
It says, "I wanna make love
to you. Crash."

427
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,933
Oh, my.

428
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,147
See my hips?

429
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,311
Yep.

430
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:09,824
And I think Susan Sontag
is brilliant.

431
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:13,452
Is this gonna happen? Us?

432
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,261
I'm committed to Nuke
for the season.

433
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,460
Oh.

434
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,300
You had your chance
the other day.

435
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,431
What is it you see in this guy?

436
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:29,478
He's a young, wild...

437
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,342
dim, pretty boy.

438
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,576
Young men are uncomplicated.

439
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:38,620
And he's not dim.
He's just inexperienced.

440
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:41,356
It's my job
to give him life wisdom...

441
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,518
and help him get on
to the major leagues.

442
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:46,994
That's funny,
that's my job too.

443
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,531
Damn!

444
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:52,528
You're pulling your hips.

445
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:56,538
I know,
but they're nice hips.

446
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,437
I looked up your records.

447
00:30:58,542 --> 00:30:59,531
You what?

448
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:02,237
You hit 227 home runs
in the minors.

449
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:04,006
That's not bad.

450
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,741
Don't tell anybody.

451
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,783
Why not?
You hit 20 more this year...

452
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:09,784
you're gonna be the all-time
minor-league champ.

453
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:10,978
The record's 246.

454
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:13,988
Well, 247 home runs
in the minor leagues...

455
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,184
would be a kind of
dubious honor.

456
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:20,263
I think it would be great.
<i>The Sporting News</i> should know it.

457
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:23,730
No. Just no. Please.

458
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,559
Okay.

459
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:31,605
Last chance,
your place or mine?

460
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,575
Despite my rejection
of most Judeo-Christian ethics...

461
00:31:34,678 --> 00:31:38,671
I am, within the framework
of the baseball season, monogamous.

462
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,442
- Gimme a break.
- It's true.

463
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:43,610
Stop it.

464
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,886
Jeez, the fact is...

465
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,426
you're afraid of meeting a guy
like me, 'cause it might be real...

466
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:55,259
so you sabotage it with some,
what is it...

467
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:58,266
bullshit about commitment
to a young boy you can boss around.

468
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,233
That's a great deal.

469
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,429
Nice.

470
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,233
I know women like you.

471
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:08,406
You're a regular
patron saint.

472
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,708
Stray cats, lost causes...

473
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:15,649
or 6'3" homeless studs.

474
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:18,550
Oh, Crash,
you do make speeches.

475
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:36,231
Crash, that was fabulous.

476
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:39,132
Crash?

477
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,543
You mean Nuke.
You said Crash.

478
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,878
No, I said Nuke.

479
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:51,419
You said Crash.

480
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,011
Oh, no.

481
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:55,057
Sweetie, you shouldn't listen
to what a woman says...

482
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:58,321
when she's in the throes
of passion.

483
00:32:58,428 --> 00:33:00,623
They say the darndest things.

484
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,493
Yeah, you said Crash.

485
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,932
Honey...

486
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,470
would you rather I'd be making love
to him using your name...

487
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,665
or making love to you
using his name?

488
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,382
Yeah, maybe you're right.

489
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:26,183
Welcome to the Eastern Seaboard
Tobacco Growers...

490
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:29,315
City Council Little League
Cash Drop Day.

491
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:33,829
These young fellas... young men,
I should say... over here to my left.

492
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,922
Hi, 18. Hi, 12.

493
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:38,466
Hey, Dino.

494
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,664
Hey, Millie.

495
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:50,773
Hey. I'm Millie.

496
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,013
I'm married.

497
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,890
What is that?

498
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:04,118
Chicken bone cross.

499
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:06,525
Takes the curse off the bat
that brings me hits.

500
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:10,022
What are you,
a goddamn witch?

501
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,102
Yes, a switch-hitting witch.

502
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,272
Will that work for me?

503
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:18,363
If you believe in voodoo.

504
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:21,342
Jose, I am zero for 16.

505
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:23,435
A big fucking
doughnut hole for 16.

506
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:26,106
I can't remember the last time
I had a base hit.

507
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:28,013
Let me have
some of that stuff.

508
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:30,712
That is not belief.
That's desperation.

509
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,017
Jose, come on.
Just touch my bat once.

510
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:37,857
Come on, just once. I won't
bother you the rest of the day.

511
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,861
I swear to God.
Just touch the bat once.

512

517
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:21,294
Cut it!

518
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,807
Time-out.

519
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:27,035
Let's play ball!

520
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,904
Stay there.
Give me the ball.

521
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,978
Hey.

522
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,347
Relax, all right?

523
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:37,942
Don't try to strike
everybody out.

524
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:41,387
Strikeouts are boring.
Besides that, they're fascist.

525
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,755
Throw some ground balls.

526
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,192
More democratic.

527
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:48,321
What's this guy know, anyway?

528
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:51,400
If he's so great, how come he's
been in the minors for ten years?

529
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:54,698
If he's so hot, how come Annie
wants me instead of him?

530
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:58,205
And another thing, Meat,
you don't know shit.

531
00:35:58,308 --> 00:36:00,435
You wanna make it to the Show,
you'll listen to me.

532
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:03,273
Annie only wants you 'cause
she can boss you around. Got it?

533
00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:06,777
Relax. Let's have
some fun out here.

534
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:08,976
This game's fun.

535
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,178
Fun, goddamn it.

536
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:13,755
And don't hold the ball so hard.

537
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:16,792
It's an egg.
Hold it like an egg.

538
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:24,363
What's he know about fun?
I'm young. I know about fun.

539
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:27,163
Old man, he don't know
nothin' about fun.

540
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,465
Nobody's goin' out there.

541
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,436
Why's he calling
for a curveball?

542
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,136
I wanna bring heat.

543
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:41,641
Shake him off.
Throw what you want.

544
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,051
Goddamn it. Time-out.

545
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:51,593
Hey, why you shaking me off?

546
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:55,554
I wanna bring the heater.
Announce my presence with authority.

547
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:58,031
- To announce what?
- Announce my presence with authority.

548
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,034
"Announce your presence
with authority"?

549
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:02,229
This guy's a fastball hitter,
looking for heat.

550
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:04,238
So what.
He ain't seen my heat.

551
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,170
All right, Meat.
Give him your heat.

552
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:15,073
Why does he always call me Meat?

553
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:17,084
I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

554
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:20,349
Fastball.

555
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:26,754
Come on, Nuke. Settle down.
Take your time.

556
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:41,434
<i>Home run for Bud Shelton</i>
<i>of the Fayetteville Generals.</i>

557
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:44,445
What are you doing standing here?
I gave you a gift.

558
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:47,539
You stand here showing up
my pitcher? Run, dummy!

559
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:52,380
Give me the ball.

560
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,290
He really hit the shit
out of that one, didn't he?

561
00:37:58,061 --> 00:37:59,426
Held it like an egg.

562
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:02,225
And he scrambled the son of a bitch.
He hit the fuckin' bull.

563
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:04,493

564
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:07,534

565
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,195
Oh, yeah,
I've havin' a blast.

566
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:10,397
Good.

567
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:14,600
Sucker teed off on that like he knew
I was gonna throw a fastball.

568
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,509
- He did know.
- How?

569
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:18,841
I told him.

570
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:22,651
One down now!

571
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:25,915
Come on, Nuke. You're the man.
No batter. Chuck hard, baby.

572
00:38:26,022 --> 00:38:28,490
Don't think, just throw.

573
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:41,535
Strike!

574
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,668

578

Hell of a shot.

579
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:33,487
Sorry it got wasted.

580
00:39:35,224 --> 00:39:37,715
I don't know what to do
with these guys.

581

That's what I'd do.

585
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:53,399
Yeah.

You guys, you lollygag the ball

You lollygag your way
down to first.

You lollygag
in and out of the dugout.

makes you? Larry.

- Eight and sixteen.

Eight and sixteen.

600
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,084
How'd we ever win eight?

601

It's a miracle.

602
00:40:46,629 --> 00:40:50,156
This is a simple game.

603
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:53,467
You throw the ball.

604
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:55,298
You hit the ball.

605
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,640

You got it!

00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:25,667
Yeah, Bobby.
Shut the door.

This the toughest job

But the organization
has decided to make a change.

They're releasing you
from your contract.

Skip, I know I'm in a goddamn slump,
but I hit the ball hard today.

Let's go.
We got five hours.

622
00:42:18,221 --> 00:42:20,712
Honey, I want you to wear these
when you're pitching on the road.

623
00:42:20,823 --> 00:42:22,654
- What are they?
- They're garters.

624
00:42:22,758 --> 00:42:24,919
They're gonna hug your waist
and snuggle...

625
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:27,188
and dangle off your thighs
and buns in such a wonderful way.

626
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:28,923
It'll help you see things
differently.

627

Plus, it'll remind you of me,
which is a lot nicer...

628
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:33,766
than thinking about
all those nasty hitters.

629
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:36,667
Jesus, Annie, I don't know.

630
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:38,672
You've been pitching
on the wrong side of your brain.

631
00:42:38,774 --> 00:42:40,833
This will help put things
on the right side.

632
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:43,605
Big-league pitchers
don't use these.

633
00:42:43,713 --> 00:42:46,147
They did when they were
in the Carolina League.

634
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:49,650
Nuke, excuse me.
Time to go to work.

635
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:50,810
All right.

636
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:00,119
Bye, y'all.

637
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:01,457
Gimme a break.

638
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:05,197
Go get 'em, boys!
Hit 'em where they ain't.

639
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:27,450
<i>She may get woolly</i>

640
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:32,526
<i>Young girls</i>
<i>they do get woolly</i>

641
00:43:32,628 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>'Cause of all the stress</i>

642
00:43:36,832 --> 00:43:39,426
<i>Yeah</i>

643
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:42,231
<i>When they get woolly</i>

644
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:47,537
<i>Try a little tenderness</i>

645
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:49,474
Stop it.

646
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:51,478
Thank you.

647
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,569
What?

648
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:54,650
It's not "woolly."

649
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,877
Nobody gets "woolly."
Women get "weary."

650
00:43:56,986 --> 00:43:59,147
They don't get "woolly."

651
00:43:59,255 --> 00:44:01,553
Nobody's got "stress,"
they're wearing a "dress."

652
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:03,852
Damn, I hate people
that get the words wrong.

653
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:08,354
How come you don't like me?

654
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:11,490
You don't respect yourself,
which is your problem.

655
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,333
But you don't respect the game,
and that's my problem.

656
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:19,306
- You got a gift.
- What do I got?

657
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:21,842
You got a gift. When you were
a baby, the gods reached down...

658
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:24,105
and turned your right arm
into a thunderbolt.

659
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:26,909
You got a Hall-of-Fame arm,
but you're pissing it away.

660
00:44:27,016 --> 00:44:29,610
I ain't pissing nothing away.
I got a Porsche already.

661
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:32,813
I got a 9-11,
with a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

662
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:34,890
You don't need
a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

663
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,890
What you need is a curveball.

664
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:39,187
In the Show, everybody
can hit a fastball.

665
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,263
How would you know?

666
00:44:41,364 --> 00:44:43,161
You've been in the majors?

667
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:48,533
Yeah, I've been in the majors.

668
00:44:48,637 --> 00:44:50,901
You were?

669
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:52,997
You've been in the Show?

670
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:55,009
Yeah, I was in the Show.

671
00:44:56,145 --> 00:45:00,138
I was in the Show
for 21 days once.

672
00:45:01,817 --> 00:45:03,978
Twenty-one greatest days
of my life.

673
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:07,149
You never handle your luggage
in the Show.

674
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:08,917
Somebody else
carries your bags.

675
00:45:09,024 --> 00:45:10,855
It's great.

676
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,485
You hit white balls
for batting practice.

677
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:17,733
Ballparks are like cathedrals.

678
00:45:19,402 --> 00:45:21,529
The hotels
all have room service.

679
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,865
The women all have
long legs and brains.

680
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:30,506
They're really hot?

681
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,274
Yeah, and so are the pitchers.

682
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:34,815
They throw ungodly breaking stuff
in the Show.

683
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,578
Exploding sliders.

684
00:45:39,555 --> 00:45:41,455
You could be one of those guys.

685
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:45,523
Nuke could be one of those guys,
but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

686
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:49,064
I am sick and fuckin' tired of you
calling me Meat.

687
00:45:50,533 --> 00:45:52,592
You wanna step outside?

688
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:55,135
Yeah, I'll step outside.

689
00:46:01,377 --> 00:46:04,938
What's the problem?
What's happening?

690
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:08,949
I was just gonna ask Crash to show me
how to throw a breaking ball.

691
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:12,578
Good idea.
Did anybody bring a ball?

692
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,723
Double off the wall by Higgins.

693
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:54,694
Once again, Durham pitchers are unable
to get the first out of the inning.

694
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:18,913
<i>The Bulls will attempt to end</i>
<i>a six-game losing streak...</i>

695
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:22,047
<i>against the Greensboro Hornets</i>
<i>with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill.</i>

696
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:34,829
Base hit to center field
off LaLoosh.

697
00:47:41,477 --> 00:47:43,570
That closes the book
on LaLoosh today.

698
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,204
<i>Five earned runs,</i>
<i>five hits, five strikeouts...</i>

699
00:47:46,315 --> 00:47:48,579
<i>five walks</i>
<i>and five wild pitches.</i>

700
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:50,948
<i>It's time to tell it</i>
<i>like it is, sports fans.</i>

701
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:54,250
<i>This is the most wretched</i>
<i>road trip I've seen in 20 years.</i>

702
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:57,416
<i>And possibly the worst Durham team</i>
<i>in half a century.</i>

703
00:47:57,526 --> 00:48:00,620
Is the modern-day athlete a pale
imitation of the great warriors?

704
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:02,697
Only Crash Davis
stands out this year.

705
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:05,130
<i>Begging the question, what are</i>
<i>these boys thinking about?</i>

706
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:06,963
<i>'Cause it sure ain't baseball.</i>

707
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:28,346
Hey, Mr. Hormone,
check out this.

708
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:31,688
Ice-skaters.
God, look at 'em.

709
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:34,058
Hey, fellas,
that's what we need, man.

710
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:36,688
One night with these skaters,
we can get right back on track.

711
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:37,697
Yeah, right.

712
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,325
Just need a night off
to end our losing streak.

713
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:42,529
What we need is a rain-out.

714
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:44,299
I can get us a rain-out.

715
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:46,806
There ain't been a cloud
in the sky in weeks.

716
00:48:48,644 --> 00:48:51,204
Hundred bucks says I can get us
a rain-out for tomorrow.

717
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,817
You're on.

718
00:49:06,762 --> 00:49:09,356
I ain't paying for this.
Crash, pay for this.

719
00:49:09,465 --> 00:49:11,729
Shut up. You're gonna
wake everybody up.

720
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,859
Let the bonus baby
pay for it.

721
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:17,895
Jesus, man.

722
00:49:36,258 --> 00:49:38,283
Crash, what are you doing?

723
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:49,670
Oh, my goodness!

724
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:55,438
We got ourselves
a natural disaster.

725
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:42,375
Wake up.

726
00:51:42,484 --> 00:51:44,475
You're awake.

727
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:45,610
You're okay.

728
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:48,620
You were dreaming.

729
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,318
You're okay.

730
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:55,794
I was playing damn near naked.

731
00:51:55,898 --> 00:51:58,731
- What?
- I was naked.

732
00:51:58,834 --> 00:51:59,892
Playing naked.

733
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,028
I know.

734
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:06,539
I know. I had that dream
all the time too.

735
00:52:08,477 --> 00:52:10,138
We're almost home.

736
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:19,453
Watch your head.

737
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:22,023
Here you go.
Let me get that back there.

738
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:24,718
- I'm not your slave.
- No, that one over there.

739
00:52:34,102 --> 00:52:35,160
Hi.

740
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:58,950
God, I'm tired.

741
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:01,626
What a trip.

742
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:06,165
I was lousy.
I was worse than lousy.

743
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:10,796
But every time I pitched, it was
like throwing gasoline on a fire.

744
00:53:15,644 --> 00:53:16,542
I mean...

745
00:53:16,645 --> 00:53:19,773
What is all this I, I, I?
What about me?

746
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:21,850
Aren't you glad to see me?

747
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,975
Don't I look nice?

748
00:53:25,187 --> 00:53:27,485
You look great.
I'm sorry.

749
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:29,921
I'm just totally exhausted.

750
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:33,256
Good. Physical exhaustion
can be spiritually fabulous.

751
00:53:33,362 --> 00:53:36,661
What you need
is a good game of catch.

752
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:37,823
Catch?

753
00:53:39,268 --> 00:53:41,930
Baby, come on.
Fire one in here.

754
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:44,335
This is ridiculous.
I'm a professional.

755
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:47,033
Will you just give it a try
and lean in?

756
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:50,703
Thank you.

757
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:55,209
I want you to breathe
through your eyelids.

758
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:56,215
My eyelids?

759
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:58,548
Like the lava lizards
of the Galapagos Islands.

760
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:01,748
Some have a parietal eye behind their
heads so they can see backwards.

761
00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:04,121
Haven't you ever noticed
how Fernando Valenzuela...

762
00:54:04,226 --> 00:54:07,286
he just doesn't even look
when he pitches?

763
00:54:07,396 --> 00:54:09,421
He's a Mayan Indian.

764
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:11,590
Or an Aztec. I forget which one.
I get 'em confused.

765
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,930
- So do I.
- Stand up for a second.

766
00:54:14,036 --> 00:54:15,936
I want you to be aware
of the chakra connection...

767
00:54:16,038 --> 00:54:17,938
between your feet
and your testicles.

768
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,975
- Chakra.
- Your right leg and left testicle...
