1
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,896
On my first day of law school,
my professor says two things.

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,066
First, "From this day forward,
when your mother says she loves you,

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,860
- "get a second opinion."
- And?

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,946
"If you want justice,
go to a whorehouse.

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,699
"If you want to get fucked, go to court."

6
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,741
Naomi!

7
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,952
Let's say you have a client
who you know is guilty...

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
No, don't even start with that.

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,248
Our justice system doesn't care
about that, and neither do I.

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,042
Every defendant, no matter who he is,
regardless of what he's done,

11
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:46,087
has the right to the best defense
his attorney can provide. Period.

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,548
- So where were you with the truth?
- Truth?

13
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,219
- How do you mean? Naomi!
- Coming.

14
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,222
I'm not sure how many ways
there are to mean it.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,432
You think there's only one?

16
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,933
- I can't do this.
- You're late.

17
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,810
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,687
Actually, you're right, you know.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,772
- There is only one that matters.
- Marty, hold still, please.

20
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:05,982
My version of it,

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,652
the one I create in the minds of those
12 men and women sitting on a jury.

22
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,821
Now, if you want to,
you can call it something else.

23
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,950
The... The illusion of truth, if you want.
It's up to you.

24
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,286
- Good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

25
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,873
Jack, is that it?
You need some more stuff?

26
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,291
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow afternoon?

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,836
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll have my secretary set it up.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,045
Okay.

29
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,219
- This is a cover story, right?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,929
Yeah. Okay, bye.

31
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,265
Saint Michael's Boys Choir.
Thank you. Thank you.

32
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,392
- What a talented group.
- Tell you after.

33
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,019
- Sure.
- Right now, ladies and gentlemen,

34
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,812
we're gonna have a brief photo session

35
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,398
while we have the boys here
with His Excellency.

36
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,983
I'll be back in a few minutes.

37
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,194
Please bear with us,
enjoy your dessert and thank you.

38
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,488
- Yes.
- Here we go. Okay.

39
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,952
Good, good.

40
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,249
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,375
Thank you.

42
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,765
Thanks.
Marty. What an unexpected surprise.

43
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,643
Well, I'm here to help
our friendly prosecutor off the hook.

44
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,187
- Excuse me.
- What's it gonna cost?

45
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,442
- A lot less than the alternative.
- Tomorrow at my office, 9:30.

46
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,198
- Is this on? Yes, it is.
- Your Excellency. Nice to see you again.

47
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,409
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come
to the heart of the matter,

48
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,995
the reason we've all
gathered together here tonight.

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,957
This is the fifth straight year
that it's been my privilege

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,959
to serve as your master of ceremonies

51
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,753
for The Chicago Bar Association
and Catholic Charities Ball.

52
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,214
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to put that out.

53
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,549
It's a bar, for Christ's sake.

54
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,261
Tonight, due to your generous efforts,

55
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,306
we've broken last year's record
in terms of attendees and the amount

56
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,308
- of money raised for the Archbishop's...
- I thought you quit.

57
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,810
- ...charity, and I think that deserves...
- I cut down.

58
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,395
...a big round of applause.

59
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:18,067
- You look beautiful. Cut your hair?
- Yeah. A few months ago.

60
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,820
And now, as it has been my pleasure
for the last four years...

61
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,699
- Want to dance?
- There isn't any music.

62
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,867
Sure there is.

63
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,080
...longtime State's Attorney,
God love him, Mr. John Shaughnessy.

64
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,340
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,342
- and my personal thanks...
- Come on.

66
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,177
All you have to do is turn around.

67
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,346
I thought you liked it better like this.

68
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,182
That way you don't have to look
at the person.

69
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,434
Mean.

70
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,602
Considering the hour, I'll try to keep...

71
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,104
Look at me.

72
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,523
First of all, I want to thank all of you
for coming out tonight

73
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,358
to support the Archbishop...

74
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,112
Come on, let's go find a bar
you can still smoke in.

75
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,697
Thanks for the invite,

76
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,284
but I don't like one- night stands
all that much.

77
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,955
- We saw each other for months.
- It was a one- night stand, Marty.

78
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,125
It just lasted six months.

79
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,053
Thank you, John.

80
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,972
Well, I must say

81
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,392
I haven't seen this many lawyers
and politicians

82
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,562
gathered together in one place
since confession this morning.

83
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,868
There is no way
the People are gonna tolerate

84
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,081
a monetary award to a cockroach
who deserves 20 to life.

85
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:59,418
He may be your client,
but Joey Pinero is a hard- case felon.

86
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,586
Dealing, racketeering,

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,048
- money- laundering, attempted murder.
- Did you say "alleged," Yancy?

88
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,425
I didn't hear you say...
Did you hear him say "alleged"?

89
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,886
Mr. Pinero has never been
convicted of anything.

90
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,971
Cops jumped him,
left him bleeding in the snow.

91
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,807
It's a miracle he survived.

92
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,143
Having said that,
I'm not opposed to a settlement.

93
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,107
1 .5 million, and Pinero leaves the state.

94
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,198
You can't limit a citizen's right to live
wherever he wants to.

95
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,741
Legally, that's unenforceable.

96
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,911
Whether or not it's enforceable
or just a gentlemen's agreement,

97
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,455
Mr. Pinero will know what we want.

98
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,085
Get the answer you're looking for.

99
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,796
Don't sit around and chat.
It's been a pleasure.

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,090
You're worse than the fucking thugs
you represent.

101
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,716
That's enough, Bud. It's over.

102
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,011
- Obviously, I've got to run this by him.
- You're on 40% commission, Marty.

103
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,890
I have nothing but confidence
your recommendation will prevail.

104
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,600
Thank you, John.

105
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,907
My hand!

106
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,119
Oh, shit.

107
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,101
- Hey.
- Mr. Vail.

108
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,686
How you doing?

109
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,326
Nice tune.

110
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,502
So, what'd they say?

111
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,299
Take it or leave it all for 1.5 million.
From Shaughnessy himself.

112
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,052
What do you think?

113
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,348
I think we should take it,

114
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,975
unless you want to spend
the next two years of your life

115
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,226
tied up in appellate court.

116
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,729
- No, fuck that. Close it.
- Done.

117
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,567
Okay.

118
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,909
Your shot.

119
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,788
There's one more little thing.

120
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,793
They want you...
They want you to leave the state.

121
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,422
- They want you to disappear.
- Disappear?

122
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,762
- That's good. Same bullshit, right?
- What? What are you talking about?

123
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,851
I keep getting these offers
from these guys, Marty.

124
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,603
What offers?

125
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,773
Well, a couple of months ago,
a cop walks in here.

126
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,069
He says,
"You testify against Alderman Martinez,

127
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,571
"and we'll owe you, Joey.

128
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,157
"Say he did you favors,
say he's on your payroll,"

129
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,118
shit like that, right?
So I tell him to go fuck himself.

130
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,829
Why? Because Martinez is a good man.

131
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,122
He's the only one holding out

132
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,751
while the others try to turn South River
into high- rent condos.

133
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,129
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- Why?

134
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,382
'Cause this shit happens every day.

135
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,258
I didn't think it had anything
to do with this.

136
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,802
- You don't?
- Hey.

137
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,303
I've spent a lot of money in this place.

138
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,722
- They've spent a lot more, a lot more.
- I built a clinic here.

139
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,600
- These people depend on me.
- I don't give a shit.

140
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,144
Send them checks from California.

141
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,990
I respect your advice, Marty,
but I can't take it.

142
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,742
I'll take the money,
but I ain't going anywhere.

143
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,578
- This is my home.
- I don't like it, Joey.

144
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,167
- So what are they gonna do, kill me?
- They tried once.

145
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,839
How are they going to kill a man
who never sleeps?

146
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,590
- Get the money.
- You're too much.

147
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,926
- Hey.
- Yeah.

148
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,220
That song you like? Fourth cut.

149
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,224
- Very nice, thank you.
- Yeah.

150
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,953
Christ, we got enough
fucking cops here?

151
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,372
No doubt, the police are gonna have
their hands full with this one.

152
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,124
Captain Stenner,
can you tell us anything right now?

153
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,293
I don't know anything. I just got here.

154
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,753
Captain Stenner,
can you tell us what's going on?

155
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,005
Andy, I haven't seen anything yet.

156
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,132
As soon as I go inside,
I'll come out and tell you, okay?

157
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,592
All right.

158
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,198
You should be home in bed, Abel.
It's going around.

159
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,408
I'll consider that, Harvey.

160
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,081
- Christ.
- What a mess, huh?

161
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,396
Sam, you got all you need?
Okay, gently roll him over.

162
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,618
Police! Stop!

163
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,247
Right thumb and forefinger severed.

164
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:39,795
Symbol "B32.156"
is carved into the chest.

165
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:50,639
- Body temperature, still warm.
- Captain, we got a live one on the run.

166
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,415
You can see now, a passing train
has separated the fleeing suspect...

167
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,750
You want to know what I hate?
I'll tell you what I hate.

168
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,002
I hate when they go on and on

169
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,170
about what big fucking whores
the defense attorneys are.

170
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,880
...the suspect is headed into the train...

171
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,425
We're the bad guys. You know why?

172
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,843
'Cause we're always sitting
next to some creep,

173
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,595
we start to look creepy, you know?

174
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,804
Plus, they assume they're guilty.

175
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,390
You know, they assume they did it,
and, like, we know or something.

176
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,435
You don't know.
You don't ask. You don't care.

177
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,312
You do the goddamn job.

178
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,439
It's not like they're your friends,
for Christ's sake.

179
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,524
...there's no telling
where the suspect may have gone...

180
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,152
Well, some are your friends, but...

181
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,998
So, why'd you leave
the State's Attorney's Office?

182
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,208
Dead- end job.

183
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,881
You either... You either run for office,
or you end up a judge.

184
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,800
Why become an umpire
when you can play ball?

185
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,845
...continue to pour into the area
around Saint Michael's

186
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,597
and the Archbishop's mansion.

187
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,867
Over here! He's over here!

188
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,583
We will, of course,
stay with this shocking story

189
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,169
as it continues to unfold
throughout the day.

190
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,712
Now, what we do know right now

191
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,007
is that at approximately 11:08
this morning, this...

192
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,635
So, when did you know you had them?

193
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,429
Now, at this hour, the scene
at Saint Michael's is crowded...

194
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,056
- What? Sorry.
- Was there a moment

195
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,308
during the Pinero trial
when you said to yourself,

196
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,018
"I've got them"?

197
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,689
The day I took the case. Excuse me.

198
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,065
...the shocking murder this morning

199
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,609
of one of Chicago's
most beloved figures,

200
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,029
Archbishop Richard Rushman,
has left the city just numb.

201
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,699
Okay, I understand we have Andy live.
Let's go to Andy.

202
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,950
Diann, we have just learned

203
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,703
that Chicago police have arrested
a 19- year- old man

204
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,539
tentatively identified as Aaron Stampler.

205
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,124
Now, according
to Captain Abel Stenner...

206
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,085
We're gonna have to reschedule.
Call my office, okay? I'm sorry.

207
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,046
...underneath McCormick Place
just minutes after the murder...

208
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,510
...through cold- blooded savagery, a
beacon of hope has been taken from us.

209
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,053
Law offices of Martin Vail.

210
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,305
- You got the news on, by any chance?
- Yeah, we're watching it.

211
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,100
All right, I want you to call Sullivan
in Judge Trotter's office.

212
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,685
Find out where they took him,
and call me right back.

213
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,811
I'm at The Alibi.

214
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,980
- A lot of guys are gonna want this one.
- Okay.

215
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,566
The police have taken the first steps,

216
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,026
acting with speed and determination
with the arrest.

217
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,716
Are you taking the Stampler case?

218
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,926
Andy, I'm sorry.
I can't talk to you about anything.

219
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,471
Thank you very much.

220
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,307
When are you gonna talk?

221
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,436
- State's Attorney left yet?
- Yeah. Yancy, no less.

222
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,314
- Yeah? P.D.?
- Come and gone. Lockup!

223
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,526
- Give my best to your brother.
- Yeah, sure.

224
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,655
I'd like to see him alone, if I could.

225
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,199
All right,
but I'm gonna have to lock you in.

226
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,700
Understood.

227
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,647
You know who I am?

228
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,068
Well, no. No, sir. No, I don't.

229
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,573
My name is Martin Vail.
I'm what you call a big- shot attorney.

230
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,536
I don't... I don't have no money.

231
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,120
No, I didn't think you did.

232
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,832
I'm willing to take your case pro bono,

233
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,836
which means you get all of my expertise
and hard work for free.

234
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,338
Or, if you want to,

235
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,175
you could get the $40,000- a- year,
court- appointed public defender,

236
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,469
who will almost certainly
escort you personally to death row.

237
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,346
Your choice.

238
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,598
No. No, sir. I...

239
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,352
I'd surely be grateful
for anything you could do for me.

240
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:52,315
You're welcome.
Now, your full name is?

241
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:58,446
My... Aaron Luke Stampler.

242
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,075
Stampler.

243
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,663
- You from Kentucky, Aaron?
- Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.

244
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,791
Does it say that there?

245
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,297
How long you been here in Chicago?

246
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,968
Well, two years next month, I think.

247
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,722
- Have you ever been arrested?
- No. No, sir.

248
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,520
So how do you know the Archbishop?

249
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,069
I was begging on the street
up on Wacker Drive,

250
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,658
Bishop Rushman came by
in his Cadillac.

251
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,829
He saw me, and he stopped.

252
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,960
He took me into Savior House.
I work as an altar boy.

253
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,671
I sing in his choir.

254
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,674
How long were you there
at Savior House?

255
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,760
Year, year and a half.

256
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,846
You're supposed to leave
when you're 18,

257
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:11,561
but Bishop Rushman let me stay on
way past my 19th birthday.

258
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,023
That was nice of him.

259
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,861
Yes. Yes, it was.

260
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,326
Aaron, did you have any reason
to dislike the Archbishop?

261
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,746
Dislike? No. No, sir.

262
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,249
He was like a father to me.

263
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,960
Yeah, but you...

264
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,922
How do I say this? Were...

265
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,842
Were you in the room
when he was murdered?

266
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,722
How can you explain that?

267
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,060
There was someone else
in that room, Mr. Vail.

268
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,314
- There was a third person?
- Yes, sir.

269
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,357
Did you tell the police this?

270
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,986
Yes. Yes, I did,
but they didn't believe me.

271
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,488
All right. Well, you tell me now.

272
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:09,244
I was returning a book
to Bishop Rushman's library.

273
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:14,749
I heard noise, so I went back into his...
In his bedroom.

274
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,840
Bishop Rushman was laying
on the floor.

275
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,926
There was blood all over everything.

276
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:32,308
And then I seen a shadow. I seen
a person leaning over Bishop Rushman.

277
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:39,315
He looked up and then he came at me,
and that's when I lost time.

278
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,403
What does that mean, "lost time"?

279
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,365
I blacked out.

280
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,952
It just... It happens to me sometimes.

281
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,875
I just... I have spells.

282
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,086
I have spells. I lose time. I can't...

283
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,673
I can't remember nothing.

284
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,308
Why did you run from the police, Aaron,
if you didn't do anything wrong?

285
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,101
Well, when...

286
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:18,271
When I woke up, I was covered in blood.

287
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:25,445
I didn't know what to do.
I got scared. I heard sirens, so I ran.

288
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,074
Look, I know how it looks, Mr. Vail,
but I swear...

289
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,076
Yeah, I don't need you
to try to convince me, Aaron.

290
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,744
I just want you to answer my questions.

291
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,371
But I didn't do this.
You've got to believe me.

292
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,041
No, I don't have to believe you.
I don't care.

293
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,167
I'm your attorney,

294
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,798
which means I am your mother,
your father, best friend and your priest.

295
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,010
In other words, I don't want you talking
to anyone but me from now on.

296
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,971
Not the cops, not the press,
not the other guys in the cells here,

297
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,809
nobody without my permission,
you understand? Yeah?

298
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,479
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- All right.

299
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,441
Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?

300
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,363
- My what?
- Suit size. What, you're about a 38?

301
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,286
I don't know.

302
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,748
- About a 38 long.
- Okay.

303
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,959
Stampler was flushed by the police

304
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,670
from his hiding place in the bushes
behind the cathedral.

305
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,589
The police chased him through the train
yard, just north of McCormick Place,

306
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,425
almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks

307
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,512
before an oncoming train,
separating him from the police.

308
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,596
In a later development,

309
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,099
prominent local
criminal defense attorney Martin Vail

310
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,102
is believed to have visited Stampler
at the Maxwell Street Precinct...

311
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,106
After a brief chase across the rail yard
behind Saint Michael's Cathedral,

312
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,317
Stampler was apprehended in a hole
beneath train tracks.

313
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:50,905
- Are you gonna defend this man?
- Andy, I'm sorry. I can't...

314
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,490
Thank you very much. Thank you.

315
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,744
We've taken the first step
in the process.

316
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,038
I can now take your questions.

317
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,624
Can you tell us anything
about the altar- boy group

318
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,419
- that Aaron Stampler was part of?
- Not much at this time.

319
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,505
Have you ruled out the involvement
of any of the other altar boys?

320
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,258
We have no reason to suspect anyone
other than Stampler.

321
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,385
He had access
to the Archbishop's quarters.

322
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,554
He was caught fleeing the area
of Saint Michael's.

323
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,639
The blood- soaked Aaron Stampler
was chased

324
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,974
down under McCormick Place,

325
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,351
but not before he was almost killed
by a passing train.

326
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,520
Law office of Martin Vail.

327
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,106
He's gonna call you
as soon as he gets in.

328
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,358
I know. I promise you.
Okay, thank you very much.

329
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,902
- Naomi!
- Yeah.

330
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,069
- Talk to you later. Bye.
- Hey.

331
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,946
Sorry I'm late. We have a new client.

332
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,033
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.
- Who?

333
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,368
You know what
they're calling him already?

334
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,954
- The Butcher Boy of Saint Mike's.
- I like that.

335
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,581
Well, that's good.
You're gonna be hearing it a lot.

336
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,750
This kid who chopped up
the Archbishop, he's our new client?

337
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,210
Tommy, you're gonna have to try harder

338
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,462
to get the word "allegedly"
into your vocabulary,

339
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,130
- especially if you want to be a lawyer.
- Here you go.

340
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,965
- Tommy, you want coffee?
- No. No, thanks.

341
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,219
All right. He admits he was in the room
when the killing occurred,

342
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,137
but he didn't actually see it happen.

343
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,513
- Can I stop you right there?
- No.

344
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,891
He was returning a book
to the Archbishop.

345
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,894
He heard loud noises in the bedroom.

346
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,396
He went in. He sees a figure,

347
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,484
someone in the shadows
kneeling over the body. He blacks out.

348
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,777
Next thing he knows,

349
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,946
sirens are screaming,
he's covered in blood.

350
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,114
The cops find him in a train tunnel.

351
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,492
He's got the Archbishop's ring
in his pocket.

352
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,868
He stole the Archbishop's ring?

353
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:22,080
I didn't say that.
I said it was in his pocket.

354
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,001
Is that it?

355
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,922
Yep.

356
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,636
That's... That's bullshit, Marty.

357
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,597
That's the worst bullshit story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

358
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,643
Now it's our bullshit story.
Okay, let's get to work.

359
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,938
Now, the name of the game here
is motive,

360
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,940
as in, the prosecution doesn't have one.

361
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,441
So what we have to do here

362
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,569
is prove that someone else
could have committed the crime.

363
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,571
Then we can establish
reasonable doubt.

364
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,449
So I want to know everything I can
about this guy, everything he was into.

365
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:02,745
We go to database,
go to Hall of Records, IRS files.

366
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,123
- Even his so- called charities.
- So- called?

367
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,875
The guy was a priest, for Christ's sake.

368
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:13,423
Naomi, write this down. B- 32.156.

369
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,258
That was carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

370
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,010
- Allegedly.
- No.

371
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,804
That was a fact,
but I appreciate the effort, Tommy.

372
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,306
Thanks.

373
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,641
I also need case histories
on murder by stabbing,

374
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,602
murder by mutilation,
murder by religion.

375
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,480
- Also, I'm gonna need a psychiatrist.
- You're telling me.

376
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,733
And not the kind
that lives in a witness box, either.

377
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,318
I need a real one this time,

378
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,861
and someone who knows
about amnesia.

379
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:38,740
- What does he look like in person?
- The Butcher Boy?

380
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,328
Like a Boy Scout.

381
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,415
A Boy Scout
with a merit badge in carving.

382
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,878
The Archbishop was a close
personal friend of Mr. Shaughnessy.

383
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,630
He came to me earlier this morning
and asked me who was my best man,

384
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,924
- I said you.
- Thank you.

385
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,720
I trust, Mr. Shaughnessy,
if I am to prosecute this case,

386
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,098
I'll be given the authority
which comes with the assignment.

387
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:08,686
You're the one trying the case, but
let's establish one thing at the outset.

388
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,772
I want the death penalty.

389
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,775
I'd like an opportunity
to go over the case

390
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,109
before we make a determination

391
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,694
on whether or not
to seek the death penalty.

392
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,529
I'm open to anything
you have to say, Janet,

393
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,115
but in my mind there's no debate.

394
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,703
Did he say anything,
the boy they picked up?

395
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,663
Yeah. He didn't do it.

396
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,541
It's a slam dunk, Janet.

397
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,795
Excuse me.
I appreciate your faith in me,

398
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,213
and I don't mean to be argumentative...

399
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,839
Hey, that's what we pay you for.

400
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,842
...but if it's as open and shut
as you say it is, then you don't need me.

401
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:44,555
The P.D. will plead no contest,
throw the kid on the mercy of the court.

402
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,062
- There's not a public defender.
- He's got a lawyer already? Who?

403
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,028
Hey, I'm Martin Vail.
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.

404
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,409
- I need to inspect the murder site.
- The Butcher Boy?

405
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,245
Thank you. Yes. I forgot his real name.

406
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,337
What's the matter, Marty,
lost your faith?

407
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:18,881
Looking for a little religion?

408
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,091
Now tell me, Counselor,

409
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,261
which one of us
is the true headline- chaser here?

410
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:27,181
- Unlike you, I was assigned to this case.
- Yeah? Think you're up to it?

411
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,435
Sell the book rights yet,
or are you gonna wait a while?

412
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,562
Want to see some pictures?

413
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,483
Come on. They're kind of cute.

414
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:46,451
I think you'll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime.

415
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,081
A small piece of advice,

416
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,584
don't use the word "heinous"
in a courtroom.

417
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,752
Half the jury won't know
what you're talking about.

418
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,337
One small piece of advice,

419
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,798
I'm not sitting second chair
to you anymore.

420
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,676
In case you hadn't noticed, I graduated.

421
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:11,309
- I had no reason to leave.
- You had every reason to leave.

422
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,477
How can you still work for them?

423
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:16,105
What? You really expect me
to trot out after you, Marty?

424
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,152
Quit, just because you did?
I don't need a Mercedes.

425
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,405
I don't need to see my face
on the evening news.

426
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,288
You knew I was coming here,
didn't you?

427
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,291
You knew I would defend him.
That's why you took the case.

428
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,584
You asked Shaughnessy for this,
didn't you?

429
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,419
Oh, please.

430
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,924
What's the matter, Marty, you nervous?

431
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,762
Been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain?

432
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,518
What is the matter? You tired?
You haven't been sleeping well?

433
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,811
You're the one
with the score to settle, Marty.

434
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,813
I sleep great at night.

435
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,812
- Hi.
- Hey.

436
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,340
Thanks.

437
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,637
- Hey. Where is he?
- Over here.

438
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,783
All right,
we'll be sitting at a table together,

439
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,244
along with two of my associates.
Now, once the charges are read,

440
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,955
the judge is gonna ask you
how you plead.

441
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,333
- Not guilty.
- No.

442
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,210
- But I'm not guilty, Mr. Vail.
- I don't care. It doesn't matter.

443
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,171
You can keep your mouth shut.
You don't say anything.

444
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,840
Well, you're going to say I'm not guilty.

445
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,717
I'll say whatever I say.
You don't have to worry about it.

446
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,761
- But, Mr. Vail...
- This is exactly what I'm talking about.

447
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,805
This can't go on in the courtroom,
so you might as well get used to it now.

448
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,642
I speak. You do not speak.

449
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,602
Your job is just to sit there
and look innocent.

450
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,479
Well, I am innocent.

451
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,565
That's it!
That's exactly how I want you to look.

452
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,651
That's exactly it.
Now, can you remember that?

453
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,778
Look in the mirror if you have to.
That's the look.

454
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,989
I don't have to.
This is how I always look.

455
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:15,993
Well, then you're way ahead
of the game already, aren't you?

456
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,495
Don't smile.

457
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,290
Don't.

458
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,592
Mr. Vail, can we have a statement?

459
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,094
No. We're gonna find out
what happened here.

460
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,888
How can you defend Aaron Stampler
in the face of all this public pressure?

461
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,264
The only pressure is to find the truth.

462
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,683
...with the Archbishop's blood on him.

463
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,227
You've been talking to the police again,
haven't you? I told you not to.

464
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,645
As usual, they get everything wrong.

465
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,771
Come on. How're you gonna explain

466
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,439
the fact that
he had blood- soaked clothing on him?

467
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:46,691
- We all saw that.
- At this juncture,

468
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,858
I'm not going to explain it at all.

469
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,944
I've only recently been retained
in this case.

470
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,614
Significant facts are in dispute here
and continue to be in dispute.

471
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,409
Marty, you're a master at putting
the victim on trial

472
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,785
to help your own client.

473
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,995
That's going to be very difficult
in this case.

474
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,665
A victim in this case is my client.

475
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,876
We have two victims here, no suspects.
Thank you very much.

476
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,044
Are you worried about his safety, Marty?

477
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,546
No. Thank you.

478
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,061
It's not a case.

479
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,939
I don't think there'll be any question
about the verdict.

480
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,739
All rise.

481
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,701
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

482
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,706
- Bailiff?
- State v. Aaron Stampler.

483
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,041
Is everyone here? Sit down.
Is everyone here?

484
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,085
Yes, Your Honor.

485
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,754
Madam Prosecutor?

486
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,214
The State charges the prisoner,
Aaron Stampler,

487
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,759
with the crime
of murder in the first degree.

488
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,552
How does your client plead, Counselor?

489
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,762
Your Honor, if it pleases the court,

490
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,098
I need time to make
a complete psychiatric evaluation

491
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:02,266
before any charges
are brought against us.

492
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,019
State has more than enough evidence
to warrant the allegations, Your Honor.

493
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,896
I agree. Motion denied.

494
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,774
Mr. Stampler,

495
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,776
do you understand the charges
brought against you?

496
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,111
- Yes. Yes, I...
- Your Honor, I direct my client

497
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,321
not to answer that question

498
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,616
on the grounds that his response
may tend to incriminate him.

499
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,784
The defendant is taking the Fifth

500
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,619
on whether or not
he understands the charges?

501
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:25,247
Yes, Your Honor. Until we have
a complete psychological evaluation,

502
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,959
he will be taking the Fifth
on any and all questions posed to him.

503
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,756
State v. Appleby for your review
of precedent.

504
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,216
Thank you.

505
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,026
No, no, I can't do that. No.

506
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,156
What do you want?

507
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:03,077
I'm looking for the room
a kid named Aaron Stampler stayed in.

508
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,082
- You the police?
- I'm his uncle.

509
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,899
- Thanks.
- Well, hey.

510
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,912
- This is Alex's.
- Who's Alex?

511
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:32,249
- He's one of the other altar boys.
- An altar boy?

512
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,085
An altar boy was wearing this?

513
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,421
Well, not at the mass.

514
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,425
Well, this altar boy attacked
a colleague of mine.

515
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,427
He hurt him pretty bad.

516
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,516
What do you think he was doing there
in your room?

517
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,185
- My room?
- Yeah.

518
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:57,483
I can't... I don't know.

519
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,736
- I mean, I don't have nothing.
- You know where I could find him?

520
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,780
Who? Alex?

521
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,868
- No, I don't... I don't know where he is.
- You don't?

522
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,538
- Who's Linda?
- Linda?

523
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,468
She your girlfriend?

524
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:30,599
- Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.
- I don't know where she is.

525
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,477
Why is it that I get this feeling
you're not telling me something, Aaron?

526
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,563
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I don't think so.

527
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,733
Are you surprised that Alex
attacked my friend?

528
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:45,531
- No. No, I mean, he has a temper.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so.

529
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,869
Let me ask you this.
Do you think it could be Alex

530
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,373
who was that figure you saw
at the Archbishop's room?

531
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,753
- I... Alex? I couldn't be sure.
- But it could be him?

532
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,964
I don't know.

533
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,550
Aaron, you're not understanding this.
The State wants you dead.

534
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,136
If you don't help me,
that's exactly what they're gonna get.

535
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,303
I...

536
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,934
I'm trying. I can't remember.

537
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:17,688
I don't understand. Why would Alex
want to do such a thing?

538
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,108
For his own reasons. He...
Maybe someone hired him.

539
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,238
- Hired by who?
- I don't know. Forget it.

540
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,161
What I need to know is,
do you think he's capable of doing it?

541
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,246
I don't know. He...

542
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,418
I don't know
who's capable of such a thing, Mr. Vail.

543
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,134
- Thanks.
- Sure.

544
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,554
So he claims there was someone else
in the room

545
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,806
and that he can't remember.

546
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,727
And you want me
to look into this amnesia question

547
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,563
- and see what he actually knows.
- Yeah.

548
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,982
What if he knows he did it?

549
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:06,028
The major causes of amnesia
are substance abuse, seizures,

550
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,447
head injuries and malingering.

551
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,911
I think the kid's telling the truth.

552
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:16,830
Okay.

553
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,084
Then let's get something straight.

554
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,586
I'm more than happy to go in
and analyze him.

555
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,005
In fact, I'm looking forward to it.

556
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,425
But I won't go in there
to validate his story, understood?

557
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,179
- You do your job, I do mine.
- That's right.

558
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,056
Listen, if I think it's necessary,

559
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,810
I'd want to get an MRI, EEG,
and neuropsych testing, agreed?

560
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,938
- Yes, Doctor. Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.

561
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,363
I'll be recording our meetings
for Mr. Vail,

562
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,616
so what we talk about
isn't as confidential the way it might be

563
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,410
if you were to be consulting
with a doctor for help.

564
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,870
He may even call me as a witness,

565
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,123
so if you have any questions
about what I've just said,

566
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,250
you should raise them now,
while he's still here.

567
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,545
- No, ma'am. I understand.
- Good.

568
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:09,049
- So, okay. I think we'll be fine.
- All right.

569
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,052
- I'll see you later. All right.
- Okay.

570
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,220
Bye.

571
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,313
Mr. Vail told me
that there was a period of time

572
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,441
surrounding the Archbishop's death
that you don't remember.

573
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:30,821
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Yes. I lost the time.

574
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,867
I mean, I blacked out.

575
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,830
- Have you had these blackouts before?
- Yes. Yes, I have.

576
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,167
When's the first time
you remember them happening?

577
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,048
They started
when I was about 12, maybe.

578
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,843
Were your parents aware
of what was happening to you?

579
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:57,556
No. My mother was dead.

580
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,684
And your father?

581
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:08,358
No. No. No. He was not a nice man.

582
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,196
- Did you seek treatment?
- Did I what?

583
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,823
Did you see a doctor for them?

584
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,328
No. No.

585
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:23,332
You don't go see a doctor in Creekside
unless your leg's broke.

586
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:36,011
- Hey. Can I talk to you?
- Talk.

587
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:40,891
- Excuse us. I'll bring her right back.
- How dare you. What am I?

588
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,018
I'm some kind of chess piece
you can just move around?

589
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:47,648
- I was in the middle of my lunch.
- When are we getting all the discovery?

590
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,774
What do you want, Marty?

591
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,317
I want to know
when we're getting all the discovery.

592
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,403
- I've got motions to file.
- No, you don't.

593
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,781
You're looking to make a deal.

594
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,784
I have no authority to deal.

595
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,578
I haven't discussed this with my client.
What's your excuse?

596
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,705
Well, if I thought we needed
to make a deal,

597
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,207
I have all the authority I want.

598
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,377
Bullshit! Shaughnessy wants
the whole shot on this,

599
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,379
and he's using you to get it.

600
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,130
Anybody in your position
would deal this down

601
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,340
to murder with no death penalty.

602
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,678
My position?
We have a fucking great case.

603
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,554
Great case?

604
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,433
Lack of prior record, no eyewitness,
no confession, no motive.

605
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,060
Hard evidence.

606
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,438
I assume this conversation means
you're not going with insanity,

607
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:32,025
which is a shame.
My shrinks would have torn him apart.

608
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,697
By the way, your pleading the Fifth
on the charges was brilliant.

609
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,407
- It was good, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

610
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,866
I liked it.

611
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,705
You lose this case, you take the fall,
not Shaughnessy.

612
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:50,460
- Talk to me.
- We're going to trial, Marty.

613
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,339
All right, all it takes is one,

614
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,134
just one juror
that doesn't believe he did it.

615
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:59,845
One juror, with a kid his age,
looks into that face...

616
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,056
I've got to admit, that face is great.
Are you prepping him to take the stand?

617
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,392
That stutter, it's priceless.

618
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,774
Marty, don't tell me
you think he didn't do it.

619
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,362
What, has little Aaron Stampler
gotten to you?

620
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:21,992
We're not just talking about jail here.
It's about ending someone's life.

621
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,994
If you're wrong
and Shaughnessy's made you do this,

622
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,289
- you gonna be able to live with it?
- I'll live.

623
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,626
See you in court.

624
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,466
Your Honor, we stipulate
that murder was done here.

625
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,843
Therefore, these photographs
have no remaining probative value.

626
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,763
This is not just murder.
This is a case of mutilation and torture.

627
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:46,016
The only reason the prosecution wants
to show these gory pictures to the jury

628
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,309
- is shock appeal.
- That is not true, Your Honor.

629
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,353
- They should be excluded, absolutely.
- They clearly identify

630
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,812
the heinous nature of the crime,

631
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,522
and they connect the defendant,

632
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,733
who was found covered in blood,
to the crime scene.

633
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,234
- Prejudicial.
- I beg to differ.

634
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,528
- Beg all you want. I don't...
- Counsel, please.

635
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,614
The photographs are in, Mr. Vail.

636
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,740
Now, would you two like a recess

637
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,784
so you can carry on this discussion
in private?

638
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,744
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but this is too much.

639
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,120
Next thing you know, he'll be objecting

640
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,831
if we want to bring in
the murder weapon.

641
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,669
Well, now that she brings it up...

642
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,551
This is a public building.

643
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,643
Excuse me, Mr. Vail.

644
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,647
Would you sign this for me?

645
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,821
Tell me about Linda.
Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.

646
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,323
Yes. Yes, she was.

647
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,826
How'd you meet?

648
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,580
Well, we was both at the Savior House.
I was an altar boy,

649
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:54,167
and she was doing work
for Bishop Rushman.

650
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:58,672
- What was the relationship like?
- Me and Linda?

651
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:04,261
She's real cultural.
Real cultural and very smart.

652
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:07,097
We had a nice time together.

653
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,436
We might get married.

654
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,523
Were you sleeping together?

655
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:24,823
- Well, that's private.
- I know. I have to ask the question.

656
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,868
Were you having
a sexual relationship, Aaron?

657
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,789
Yeah, yes, yes, we were.

658
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:36,460
Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

659
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,379
- No.
- Was she?

660
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,308
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

661
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,902
- Well, well, no, but...
- And that upsets you.

662
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,742
No. No. Thing is, she went away.

663
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,996
She went away for a while.

664
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:18,001
She left before this happened.
I don't even think...

665
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,629
Don't even think she knows about it.

666
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:35,018
- Yo, boss.
- Hey.

667
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,896
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

668
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,856
There's nothing cataloged
at the downtown branch

669
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:42,067
under the numbers B32156.

670
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,861
But I don't think the "B" is a "B."
I think it's an eight.

671
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,989
I think the knife slipped. 832156.

672
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,535
"Thomas Jefferson"?
I don't think he did it.

673
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,037
All right. Well, you're not gonna be
much happier with this.

674
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:58,208
A list of the Archbishop's charities
and his foundation's investments.

675
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,753
Nothing startling here,
except for how many there are.

676
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,508
Wait a minute here. What's this?

677
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:10,262
What was he doing
with the South River deal? Pull that up.

678
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,058
Who are the investors?

679
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,062
Shaughnessy?

680
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,649
That's Joey Pinero's neighborhood.

681
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,152
See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.

682
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,739
In fact, there was a house
over there on the corner

683
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,994
where I kissed my first girlfriend.
Got her pregnant, too.

684
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:37,080
- Hell of a kiss, Joey.
- Oh, yeah.

685
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,083
Anyway, this whole neighborhood's
gonna end up high- rent condos

686
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,252
if those guys get their way.

687
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,755
That's why I'm gonna buy back the lot
with the settlement you got me.

688
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
- You heard about that, right?
- Yeah.

689
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,092
- The money?
- Who hasn't?

690
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,470
- Marty's the best, man.
- Just doing my job.

691
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,889
Yeah. A million fucking five,
he's just doing his job.

692
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:58,768
Alderman, Joey tells me
a cop came around,

693
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,895
wanted him to set you up.

694
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,440
It's typical.

695
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,235
Can't buy me,
so they try and buy a brother.

696
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,196
See, most people assume
that this land we're walking on

697
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:14,659
belongs to the railroad, but it doesn't.
It belongs to the church.

698
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,162
The church?

699
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,042
- So that's the Rushman Foundation?
- That's right.

700
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,919
Along with a bunch of rich developers.

701
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,797
- Including John Shaughnessy?
- Yeah.

702
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,550
Then they got greedy,
started buying up all the land

703
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,970
and old buildings
around the church property,

704
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,847
then tearing it down.

705
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,141
Our old neighborhood
was gonna disappear.

706
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,768
So I went to the Archbishop and I said,

707
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:43,521
"What are you doing to these people?
They're poor.

708
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,816
"They're getting kicked
out of their homes,

709
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,234
"and they're Catholic."

710
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,569
Fucking A.

711
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,280
He listened. I couldn't believe it.

712
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,326
He told them to stop developing
around the church property.

713
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,410
So the partners are left

714
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,163
holding these empty buildings
they can't knock down

715
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,165
- and land they can't build on.
- That's right.

716
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,001
Shaughnessy loses millions.

717
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:07,212
Look, if I need you to, will you testify?

718
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,674
Who, me? Yeah. Easy.

719
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,259
Just change out of this suit,
put on a Brooks Brothers

720
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,261
- with loafers and tassels, you bet.
- Joey, thank you.

721
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,846
Thank you. Not you.

722
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,016
Sure.

723
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,894
I'll testify.

724
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,691
Well, you know what people think.

725
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,693
Think this great city runs itself.

726
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:34,698
They think it gets up, goes to work and
climbs into bed at night just like we do.

727
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:35,865
They're unaware of what it takes

728
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,535
to make sure the whole damn thing
doesn't break down.

729
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,705
Crime, fires, riots,

730
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,332
the goddamn water pipes
bursting under the city.

731
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,876
Christ, what a fucking mess that was.

732
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,670
And who does
the water commissioner call?

733
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:53,133
The contractor who built it? No.
He calls me. They all call me.

734
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,680
God damn, this is terrific.

735
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:03,435
They call me,
because I keep the peace.

736
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,312
That's my job.

737
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,441
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.

738
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,026
I'm the great negotiator.

739
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,987
You think people get that?

740
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,782
Truth is, they don't care.
Dumb bastards don't even vote.

741
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,118
All they want to do is eat,
sleep, watch TV

742
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,912
and occasionally fuck their wives.

743
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,914
Guess we should all thank you.

744
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,542
You're welcome.

745
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,504
John, you need some new material.

746
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,008
I've heard this "great city" speech
10 times already.

747
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:41,598
Your boy Pinero's not honoring
his side of the deal.

748
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,266
Is that what this dinner was about?
Pinero?

749
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,851
In part.

750
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:50,106
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grownup. What's the other part?

751
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:53,735
I understand your assistant's
been digging around

752
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,696
in the Archbishop's financial affairs.

753
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,907
Yeah. Well...

754
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,290
How much did you lose

755
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,460
when he pulled the plug
from South River, John?

756
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,130
Let me tell you something.

757
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,590
It's a mistake to stick your thumb

758
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,134
in the eyes of the most powerful people
in the city.

759
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,804
It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.

760
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,935
Do not fuck with me, Marty.

761
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,368
Pipes are bursting again, John.

762
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:04,097
In the most anticipated murder trial
in recent Chicago history,

763
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,308
former State's Attorney prosecutor
Martin Vail will lead

764
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,395
with his opening statement
on behalf of Aaron Stampler...

765
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,146
The prosecution's case is headed

766
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,732
by Assistant State's Attorney
Janet Venable. Venable was...

767
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,652
Richard Rushman was a man of God.

768
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,698
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.

769
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,116
He was a beacon of inspiration,

770
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,202
not only as a spiritual leader,
but as a citizen.

771
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,705
...will deliver his opening statement
tomorrow on behalf of defendant...

772
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,582
My name is Martin Vail,

773
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,793
and the reason I'm here,
and the reason you're here,

774
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,629
is to make sure
that the whole truth is known.

775
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,882
Now, we can begin to learn the truth

776
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,051
by talking about what the prosecution
does not want you to hear.

777
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:46,556
Do not be fooled by the defendant's
innocent appearance and demeanor.

778
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,935
Aaron Stampler sat in judgment
of Archbishop Rushman

779
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,813
and determined that
not only should he die,

780
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:56,232
but he should die
the most brutal way possible.

781
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,568
Aaron was arrested within minutes
of the Archbishop's death.

782
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,737
We all know that.
We all saw it on television.

783
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:04,407
But why? Because he was convenient.

784
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,410
Because there was enormous pressure
on the police to solve this crime.

785
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:11,915
The evidence will show
that Aaron Stampler stalked, ambushed

786
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,250
and savagely murdered this great man.

787
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,169
The prosecution does not want
you to hear

788
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,129
about the other altar boys
in the church choir

789
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,006
who have mysteriously disappeared.

790
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,716
At the close of evidence,
ladies and gentlemen,

791
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,928
you will learn that Aaron Stampler
had everything he needed

792
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,679
for the perfect assassination.

793
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:32,268
Using this knife,
Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed

794
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:37,065
at the Archbishop's chest,
his genitals, his eyes.

795
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:40,568
They don't want you to hear
that the Archbishop made investments

796
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,654
on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church

797
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,865
and that those investments
resulted in huge losses

798
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,076
for some very, very powerful people.

799
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,788
They don't want you to hear about
the 20 death threats this year alone

800
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,123
that the Archbishop received
prior to his death.

801
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,378
And they really don't want you to hear
about their theory of motive.

802
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,713
And why is that? Very simple.

803
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,009
They don't have one.

804
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,890
Inspector Woodside,
can you explain to the court

805
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,976
where these sneakers came from?

806
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,479
They were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended.

807
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,649
And what was the result of
the bloodstain analysis done on them?

808
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,360
The result of the analysis
proved to be human blood

809
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,988
matching the blood type
and DNA characteristics

810
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,531
of Archbishop Rushman.

811
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,325
What do the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you?

812
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,412
The killer left a pattern
of bloody footprints

813
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,038
around the area of the struggle,

814
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,000
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room.

815
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,710
All right, yes or no, Inspector?

816
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,255
Could there have been a third person in
the Archbishop's quarters that morning?

817
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,923
There is no evidence to suggest that.

818
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,175
But there's no evidence
to prove there wasn't.

819
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,343
No.

820
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,512
And after the struggle,
what happened then?

821
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,099
Well, analysis suggests that the killer
was startled during the mutilation

822
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,643
and ran from the bedroom
down the stairs.

823
00:55:55,728 --> 00:56:01,441
Is it possible, Inspector,
that the real killer, a third person,

824
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,609
who maybe was smart enough

825
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:08,031
not to tramp a whole freeway of blood
through the whole place here,

826
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,534
couldn't this third person have placed
the defendant's prints

827
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,037
on the knife while he was passed out?

828
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,039
Mr. Vail, anything is possible.

829
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,500
So, clearly, the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds?

830
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,379
Yes, he did, 78.
He tried to defend himself.

831
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,049
And that explains the cuts
on the hands and the forearms.

832
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:29,135
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure

833
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:35,058
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incise wounds?

834
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,977
That's true, Counselor. It could've been
more than one person, but I doubt it.

835
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,772
From your analysis
of the knife wounds, Dr. Weil,

836
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:44,233
do you have an opinion whether the
killer was left- handed or right- handed?

837
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,070
Well, the incise wound to the throat
and most of the chest wounds

838
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,364
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests that a left- handed person

839
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,532
was using the knife.

840
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,701
To your knowledge,
is the defendant left- handed?

841
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:54,911
Yes, he is.

842
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,246
Well, then it's possible
that a right- handed person

843
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:01,209
could've deliberately used his left hand
to inflict some of these wounds.

844
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,710
Yes, I suppose that is possible.

845
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,088
Then it would be reasonable to assume

846
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,633
that there was, in fact,
a third person there at the crime scene?

847
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,636
Reasonable, no. But it is possible.

848
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,471
Then following opening statements,

849
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,473
it was a day of strong
and detailed testimony

850
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,600
from the prosecution's first witnesses,

851
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,019
Cook County Forensics Chief
Harvey Woodside

852
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,522
and Cook County Medical Examiner
Emile Weil.

853
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,690
It was also a day of
tough cross- examination

854
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,942
of Woodside and Weil

855
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,111
by Stampler defense attorney
Martin Vail.

856
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,654
By most accounts, though,
the prosecution...

857
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,906
Captain Stenner,
I would like to thank you

858
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,950
for all the time you've given us today,

859
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,327
but, finally,
I would like to turn your attention

860
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,789
to the symbol carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

861
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,292
Now would you please tell the jury
about that, Captain?

862
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:49,048
Yes. The letter
and the numbers B32.156

863
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,925
were carved into
the Archbishop's chest.

864
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,552
What you just described,

865
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,263
have you been able
to find an identical reference anywhere?

866
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,973
I believe so, yes.

867
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:02,812
The symbol B32.156
is actually catalog code for a book

868
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,983
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement.

869
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:11,946
That particular number, the B32 part,
refers to a book,

870
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,991
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

871
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:20,955
When we opened the book to Page 156,
we discovered an underlined passage.

872
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,460
Would you please read
this underlined passage to the court?

873
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,341
"No man, for any considerable period,

874
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,429
"can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude

875
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,600
"without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true."

876
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,060
Thank you.

877
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,941
What does that passage
mean to you, Captain?

878
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,903
Objection. He's a policeman,
not an English professor.

879
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,739
His interpretation would be speculative
and irrelevant.

880
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,616
I didn't hear her ask
for an expert opinion.

881
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,784
The witness can answer.

882
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,038
Well, to me, it's simple.

883
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:05,041
The killer thought
that his victim was two- faced,

884
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,584
dishonest in some way.

885
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,502
In your experience, Captain,

886
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:12,381
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive?

887
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,884
Not often, but it happens.

888
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,141
Thanks.

889
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,977
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.

890
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,022
Did you underline that book?

891
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,691
- Did I what?
- Did you underline that book?

892
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:33,861
- No. No, Mr. Vail.
- No?

893
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:37,615
No. Mr. Vail.
I never even opened The Scarlet Letter.

894
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,701
I don't like Hawthorne.

895
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:43,246
I tried to read that one about the house
with the seven somethings

896
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,415
in high school.
I couldn't even get past Page 10.

897
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:52,255
I mean, I weren't the only one using
Bishop Rushman's library.

898
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:55,007
You know what? Everybody borrowed
books from Bishop Rushman.

899
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,342
He encouraged it.

900
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,511
His altar boys and staff,
everyone was in there.

901
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,887
Guard?

902
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,266
Thanks.

903
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,650
You don't give up, do you?

904
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,991
So you didn't know anything about that?

905
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,326
- No.
- What about the impact of...

906
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:25,121
Look, I can't talk to you right now.
My office will call you, all right?

907
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,498
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay, bye. Yeah, I'll see you.

908
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

909
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,052
What the fuck happened in there?

910
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,348
I guess that eight was a "B" after all.

911
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:48,519
You think this is funny?
We're losing this case.

912
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,981
What the hell happened, Tommy?
How could you have missed that?

913
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,149
Marty, there are 50 of them,

914
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,984
plus the entire
Chicago Police Department.

915
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,528
How was I to know he had a private
reading room in the church basement?

916
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,363
- It's your job to know.
- Fuck, Marty, you want my job?

917
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:00,948
No. I want you to do your fucking job!

918
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,658
Marty, come on.

919
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,369
I'm working
on a third- man defense here.

920
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,996
Do you know that?
Have you figured that out yet?

921
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,582
I don't have a third man.
You know why I don't have a third man?

922
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,126
'Cause you can't fucking find him!
That's why.

923
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,086
Is it that hard to find one indigent kid?

924
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,256
Look, maybe we already got
the kid who did this.

925
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,010
We have to at least consider
the possibility that he did it.

926
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,553
All the hard evidence
is pointing towards him,

927
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,055
and you keep refusing to even look at it.

928
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:27,975
I'm not refusing to look at anything!
I don't think he did it!

929
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:29,852
Look, you two,

930
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,979
we're up there in a couple of days,
and we got dick!

931
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,607
So I wish the two of you'd do
your fucking goddamn jobs, all right?

932
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,025
Fuck!

933
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,541
It must have been hard for you
to come here to Chicago.

934
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,668
You didn't know anybody.

935
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,962
No. Nobody.

936
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,632
Didn't have any money?

937
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,635
No, nothing.

938
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,641
I want to talk more about your girlfriend,
Linda, now. Can we, Aaron?

939
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,520
- No.
- Why not?

940
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:18,275
Aaron.

941
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,534
I'm sorry.

942
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:31,831
Do you think we can do this later?

943
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:37,753
- No, I want to stay with this for a minute.
- I'm just feeling a little tired.

944
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:41,340
I know. Why does talking
about Linda Forbes upset you?

945
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,219
It doesn't.

946
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,557
I just don't want to talk
about it right now.

947
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:54,728
- Why not? Are you all right?
- No, my head hurts.

948
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,983
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Let me just fix this.

949
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,282
Hey, you know what I can do
with this thing?

950
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,742
No, how the fuck should I know?

951
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,539
Jesus Christ.

952
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:23,883
Aaron?

953
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,685
What?

954
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,230
What were you saying?

955
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,792
Come on.

956
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:27,900
Stop him!

957
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,446
Who the fuck are you?
What do you want?

958
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,906
What do you want, God damn it?
I'll kill you!

959
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,325
I don't think so, Alex. Drop it.

960
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,327
Drop it.

961
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:46,251
- Remember me?
- My name is Martin Vail.

962
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,670
I don't give a fuck what your name is.

963
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,381
- You got no right doing this to me.
- I have every fucking right!

964
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:53,175
I'm Aaron Stampler's attorney,
you little shit!

965
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,929
Now, what do you know
about the Archbishop's murder?

966
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,766
Nothing.

967
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,351
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

968
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,645
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us.

969
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,815
I swear I know nothing.

970
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,150
Well, then,
what were you doing over there?

971
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,696
What were you doing at Aaron's house?
What were you looking for?

972
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,824
- A tape.
- A tape? Videotape?

973
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,450
- Yeah.
- Of what?

974
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,540
Sex stuff.

975
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,042
Sex stuff?

976
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,003
What, I have to draw a picture for you?

977
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,130
Who?

978
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,048
Who?

979
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,342
Me, Linda.

980
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:40,222
And Aaron?

981
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,142
Yeah. He shot it, too,
for the Archbishop.

982
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,728
Are you telling...

983
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:50,899
Are you telling me that Archbishop
Rushman is involved with sex stuff?

984
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,902
Yeah, he called it "purging the devil."

985
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,155
He'd say a sermon for 10 minutes,
and then he'd tell us what to do.

986
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:59,908
- You're full of shit.
- I don't give a fuck what you believe!

987
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,244
Hey, hey, hey. What? What?

988
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,204
What were you going to do
with the tape?

989
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,914
- What were you going to do?
- Trash it.

990
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,000
I was gonna throw it away.

991
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,918
Just one. One tape. Just one tape.

992
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,838
Yeah. Yeah. One. He'd use the same
one. He'd keep recording over and over.

993
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,673
So what made you think Aaron had this?

994
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:18,260
I don't know. I thought maybe he got it,
and he went back and killed him.

995
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,139
- I mean, he did kill him, right?
- No, he didn't.

996
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,810
So where's this girl? Where's Linda?

997
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:28,896
I don't know.

998
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,902
She freaked out!
She panicked. She split.

999
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:37,529
I don't know.
I'm not expecting any postcards.

1000
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:46,288
Look at me. Look at me.

1001
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,425
Get him the fuck out of here, Tommy.

1002
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,805
- Where to?
- A warm bunk and three meals a day.

1003
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:07,434
- You can't arrest me! You're not a cop!
- I used to be. Does that work for you?

1004
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,256
- Look who's here.
- Don't get up. Finish it.

1005
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,341
- It's a good article.
- You know the rules.

1006
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,677
Don't disturb anything.
Don't remove anything.

1007
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,387
If you do, it's my ass.

1008
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:46,181
Yeah, mine, too. I won't touch anything.

1009
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,534
Excuse me.

1010
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,880
...preach the gospel to every...

1011
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,511
Hello.

1012
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,432
- What are you guys watching?
- Wait a minute.

1013
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,810
Go to her. Good.

1014
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:20,525
Now help her. That's it, Aaron. Good.

1015
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,779
Linda, help out.

1016
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,866
Good. Take off her blouse, Aaron.

1017
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:33,538
That's it. Now help him, Linda.

1018
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:38,710
Isn't that sweet, Linda? Good. That's it.

1019
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,713
Now, take him in your mouth.

1020
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,257
- Here's motive.
- Aaron,

1021
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,510
take her from behind.

1022
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,722
- Aaron, take her from behind.
- Jesus Christ.

1023
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:55,811
Thanks.

1024
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,361
487113 report to...

1025
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,073
- I need to talk to him alone.
- I think there's something

1026
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,660
- we should discuss.
- I need to be alone with my client.

1027
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,589
Do you trust me?

1028
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,050
Do...

1029
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,428
Yes, yes, of course I do.

1030
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,264
Good. Because I don't trust you.

1031
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:40,105
I'll lay it all out for you.

1032
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,902
I'm losing this case.
You know why I'm losing this case?

1033
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,947
'Cause my fucking client
is fucking lying to me.

1034
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,700
- I never lied to you.
- Bullshit!

1035
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,704
That's it. No more bullshit.
No more games.

1036
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,541
Everybody thinks
you did this, everybody.

1037
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,044
I'm the only one who believes you,
and I am that close.

1038
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:05,589
So I want it all out. All of it.
Right now, right here.

1039
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,801
Did you underline that book?

1040
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,805
Hey, hey. Hey, look at me.
Did you underline that book?

1041
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,476
- No, I didn't.
- I don't believe you.

1042
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,644
- That is bullshit.
- I told...

1043
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:23,273
I don't fucking believe you!
I saw the tape!

1044
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:28,278
I saw the tape. I know what he did
to you. I want to hear it from you.

1045
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,571
No! No! No!

1046
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,573
Tell me the whole thing.
Don't fucking do this.

1047
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,784
I want you to tell me the truth,
and do not even think of lying.

1048
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,452
You fucking killed him, didn't you?
You did it!

1049
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:36,912
- You killed him. You're so full of shit!
- No!

1050
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,372
You did it, didn't you?
Tell me the truth. Don't lie to me.

1051
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:42,084
You little fuck! You did it.
You killed him! You son of a bitch!

1052
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,336
- You fucking killed him!
- No!

1053
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,505
What the hell do you want
from me now?

1054
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,758
Quit your crying! I can't understand
a goddamn word you're saying.

1055
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,344
You little sissy! You make me sick!

1056
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:58,975
- Looky here. Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

1057
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,020
This is my cell, Jack!
Who the fuck are you?

1058
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:09,361
I got you now. You're the lawyer.

1059
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,697
- You his lawyer, ain't you?
- Yeah.

1060
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,242
Yeah, with your fancy suit.
I heard about you.

1061
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:19,371
Well, my, my, you sure
fucked this one up, Counselor.

1062
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,124
It sounds to me like they're gonna
shoot old Aaron so full of poison

1063
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,417
it's gonna come out his eyes!

1064
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,129
- Where is Aaron?
- Aaron's crying off

1065
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,339
in some corner somewhere.
You scared him off!

1066
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,800
You've got to deal with me now, boy.

1067
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,886
I ought to give you a beating
on principle. Look at me.

1068
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:38,223
You ever come in here and pull any
of that tough- guy shit on Aaron again,

1069
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,225
I will kick your fucking ass to Sunday!

1070
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,687
- Do you understand me?
- I understand you. I understand.

1071
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:47,107
Aaron gets in trouble, he calls you.
You're the man.

1072
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:49,609
Well, Aaron couldn't kick his own ass.

1073
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,404
I mean, you seen him, with the...

1074
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,156
Yeah.

1075
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,159
Jesus Christ, he can't handle anything.

1076
01:14:57,243 --> 01:15:00,829
He sure as shit couldn't handle
all that preacher's blood, could he?

1077
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,582
If he'd done like I told him,
we wouldn't be in this mess,

1078
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,750
but he got scared, and...

1079
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:10,005
Ran off, got hisself caught,
the stupid little shit.

1080
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,091
So Aaron did kill Rushman.

1081
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,136
Hell, no!
Jesus Christ, where did they find you?

1082
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:20,265
Ain't you been listening to me?
Aaron don't have the guts to do nothing.

1083
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:23,268
It was me, boy.

1084
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,562
- It was me.
- It was you.

1085
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,732
- It was you. It was you.
- Yes, it was.

1086
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,861
He come crying to me like always,
stuttering and whining.

1087
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:37,324
"I can't take it no more, Roy.
You got to help me.

1088
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,284
"Please, please, Roy."

1089
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,828
I said, "Shut your mouth, you little girl!

1090
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,413
"Grow up. Be a man.
Take care of yourself."

1091
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,081
- Be a man, yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?

1092
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,670
So your name is Roy?

1093
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,674
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it? Marty?

1094
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,051
- Yeah.
- Hey, listen, Marty.

1095
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,303
I'm dying for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette on you?

1096
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,389
- No, I quit.
- Fuck that.

1097
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:05,060
I can't live without them. There's got
to be a butt around here somewhere.

1098
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:06,228
Roy.

1099
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,565
Roy, tell me about Linda.

1100
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,402
- Linda?
- Linda, yeah.

1101
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,820
Well, who the fuck cares about Linda?

1102
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,573
Well, I care about Linda.
I'd like to know about Linda.

1103
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:20,033
That little tramp.
Let me tell you something.

1104
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,577
Everybody had a piece of her,
you know what I'm saying?

1105
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,371
I mean, she had Aaron
wrapped up so tight,

1106
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,914
he actually thought
she was his girlfriend.

1107
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,667
It was pathetic. She broke his heart.

1108
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:34,047
So that's why you had to kill Rushman,
because of the sex stuff.

1109
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,677
You've seen the tape.

1110
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,098
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

1111
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:48,353
Do you think I'm playing with you?
I will break your fucking neck!

1112
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,231
I'm going to ask you again.
Have you seen that tape?

1113
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,774
I saw the tape.
Yeah, of course I saw the tape.

1114
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,694
God damn it, God damn it.
I told him to get that tape.

1115
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,154
I said, "Get the fucking tape.
It's motive, you asshole!"

1116
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,864
This is going
to fuck everything up, Marty.

1117
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,783
Don't you show that
to a goddamn person!

1118
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:02,993
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Yes.

1119
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,411
- Do you understand me?
- Yes. Shit.

1120
01:17:04,704 --> 01:17:06,162
- Aaron.
- Damn!

1121
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,168
Mr. Vail?

1122
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,968
Yeah, I'm right here, Aaron.

1123
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:29,454
He did it. The little fuck did it.

1124
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,626
How could I have missed that?

1125
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,961
- Do I need stitches?
- No.

1126
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:44,260
He didn't do it. Aaron has no idea
what just happened in there.

1127
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:47,389
I kept seeing all the signs, the big ones.

1128
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,141
The abusive background,
these repeated blackouts,

1129
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:51,476
the ellipses in thought.

1130
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,144
He's ambidextrous.
That's what I was trying to tell you

1131
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,396
when you came in tonight.

1132
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,818
Look, you may be thrilled by all this,
but I'm fucked. I don't have a case.

1133
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,446
It's textbook
multiple personality disorder.

1134
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:05,407
Put me on the stand. I'll testify.

1135
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,492
He's insane.

1136
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:13,415
I can't. I can't change plea
in the middle of a trial.

1137
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:16,251
The judge would never allow it.

1138
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,504
Besides, insanity is
the hardest thing to prove.

1139
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,548
Okay.

1140
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,260
My professional opinion?

1141
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:29,514
This is not a criminal
we're dealing with. It's a sick kid.

1142
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:33,143
He's sitting in a cell,
and it's not where he belongs.

1143
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:41,568
You got an aspirin?

1144
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,420
Come on, Connerman, ask it.

1145
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:44,756
Ask what?

1146
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,844
The question
you wanted to ask me before.

1147
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:53,097
I don't understand, Mr. Vail.

1148
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,518
"How can you defend someone
if you know they did it?

1149
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:57,685
"How can you do that?

1150
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,854
"How can you fucking defend
these fucking scumbags?"

1151
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,482
Isn’t that what you wanted to ask me?
It is, isn't it?

1152
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,901
All those fucking coy questions,
all that bullshit.

1153
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,946
Bottom line is,
"How can you do what you do?"

1154
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,412
You think it's the money, don't you?

1155
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:22,877
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice, Jack.

1156
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,589
You know,
the first thing I ask a new client is,

1157
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,051
"You been saving up for a rainy day?

1158
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:33,805
"Guess what? It's raining."

1159
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:39,978
You think it's because I want to see
my face on the cover of magazines?

1160
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:45,775
My 15 seconds on TV? I love it.
I fucking love that shit. I really do,

1161
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:48,820
but guess what.

1162
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,072
It's not it.

1163
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,161
- You go to Las Vegas?
- Yeah.

1164
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,416
I don't go to Vegas.
Why do you think I don't go to Vegas?

1165
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,127
Marty, it's late. I think that
we should both just get up and go...

1166
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:08,047
Why gamble with money when you can
gamble with people's lives?

1167
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,969
That was a joke.

1168
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:18,016
All right, I'll tell you.

1169
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:27,775
I believe in the notion that people
are innocent until proven guilty.

1170
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,988
I believe in that notion
because I choose to believe

1171
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,741
in the basic goodness of people.

1172
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:40,204
I choose to believe that not all crimes
are committed by bad people,

1173
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:43,041
and I try to understand

1174
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,712
that some very, very good people
do some very bad things.

1175
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,065
You know,
when I was working for Shaughnessy,

1176
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,109
I did something very, very bad. Maybe

1177
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:15,198
illegal. I was a prosecutor then.

1178
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:20,828
This thing that I did, I was very upset
by it, and I decided to leave.

1179
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:24,916
So I left. I became a defending attorney.

1180
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,795
The irony being that everyone
assumes I'm fucking lying anyhow.

1181
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:32,173
So I made myself this little promise that

1182
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:38,930
I would reserve my lies
for other than my public life.

1183
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,779
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.

1184
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,224
All right, all right,
so I made a little mistake.

1185
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:24,809
No shit.

1186
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:29,063
What do you want? Want a new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.

1187
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:32,817
You made a mistake?
You told us the third man did it.

1188
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,070
So now you got your third man
and a fourth man and a fifth man...

1189
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:38,489
What are you going to do, Marty?

1190
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:41,451
I don't know. I really fucked up here.

1191
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,120
You were right.

1192
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:47,081
So how are you gonna get him off?

1193
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,251
I don't know.

1194
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,338
What I know is, Aaron did not commit
first- degree murder.

1195
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:57,425
- Marty, he stabbed him a billion times...
- No, not Aaron.

1196
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:02,346
To convict someone of a capital crime,
the State must prove intent.

1197
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,766
Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.

1198
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,226
Yeah, but the only way to prove that
is to change the plea to insanity,

1199
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:10,605
which we can't do mid- trial, unless
you're planning on a career change.

1200
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:13,441
I could've been mistaken,
but I wasn't wrong.

1201
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,986
Aaron is innocent. It's Roy who is guilty.

1202
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:19,113
This kid doesn't need a lawyer.
He needs an exorcist.

1203
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:22,450
Tom, you are so full of shit. You were
not there, and you didn't see it.

1204
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:26,078
He's one sick motherfucking boy, man,
who's been fucked around his whole life

1205
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,998
by his father, by his priest.
This kid does not deserve to die,

1206
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,835
and it's our job to make sure that a jury
believes he doesn't deserve to die.

1207
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,213
- Okay.
- Okay. How do we do it?

1208
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:40,218
By somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing.

1209
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,851
- The tape.
- What about the tape?

1210
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:51,479
That's crazy. That gives him motive.

1211
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,065
No, it looks like that, but it's...

1212
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:58,653
No, actually, what it does is,
it turns this whole thing around.

1213
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:03,074
It gives concrete documentation
of what Rushman did to this kid.

1214
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,743
But we can't put it in. You know that.

1215
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:09,121
But we're not going to.

1216
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,922
Oh, fuck!

1217
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,766
- Okay. Okay.
- Good.

1218
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,553
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing?

1219
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,889
- Who is this?
- You know damn well who it is.

1220
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:10,308
- Barleycorn's, Marty. Now.
- Janet?

1221
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:13,686
Cute porno. Part of your collection?

1222
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:28,492
Hey.

1223
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:33,080
Where did you get it? You steal it

1224
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,291
- from the crime scene?
- I don't know anything about this tape.

1225
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,251
- You are such a liar.
- Think about it.

1226
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,086
- I have.
- Look, if this tape really has on it

1227
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,171
what you say it does,

1228
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,923
last thing I'd do is give it to you.
It gives you motive.

1229
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,841
- You had to give it to me.
- Why?

1230
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:46,344
You couldn't introduce it in court.
The jury would despise you for it,

1231
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,137
for dishonoring the Bishop's memory.

1232
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:52,642
But if you get me to show it, motive or
no motive, I'm the one who looks bad,

1233
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:56,270
and you gain sympathy
for your poor little abused boy.

1234
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,191
- You think so?
- I hate you.

1235
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,278
Don't use it.

1236
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,532
I have no intention of using it.

1237
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,870
- The usual, Stu.
- You got it.

1238
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,962
You're up to even more than that,
aren't you?

1239
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:22,338
I'm not up to anything.

1240
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:24,632
You're opening a door, you think
I'm going to walk through it?

1241
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,676
There's going to be a tiger
on the other end, and I don't...

1242
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,302
You know who'd be really upset
if you used it?

1243
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:29,804
- I just told you...
- Shaughnessy.

1244
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,722
- Fuck him.
- Fuck him?

1245
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,057
Fuck you.

1246
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,688
Thanks a lot.

1247
01:28:41,692 --> 01:28:44,235
All right, if this is not your motive,
what is?

1248
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,903
I have motive.

1249
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,989
Yeah, what is it?

1250
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,575
I'm really gonna tell you.

1251
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,037
Well, you better tell the jury pretty soon.
Time's running out.

1252
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,539
Here you go.

1253
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,293
You think you've got me.

1254
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:08,801
You think because you know me as
well as you do, you know how I think.

1255
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:12,263
Well, I know how you think.

1256
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,271
You know what I'm thinking?

1257
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:28,279
What happened to your face?

1258
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,117
I bumped it into a medicine cabinet.

1259
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,916
No, Marty,
that was a girl on her way out.

1260
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,050
Maybe we should come back here later.

1261
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,760
Later? Well, they close in 10 minutes.

1262
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,178
No, after.

1263
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,764
After the trial.

1264
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:58,601
When we've got nothing to lose.

1265
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:05,775
How can your timing
be so good in a courtroom

1266
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:08,360
and so bad in real life?

1267
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,992
I'll think about it later.
I hate you too much right now.

1268
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,464
You got a visitor.

1269
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:31,634
Here she comes.

1270
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,846
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

1271
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:37,932
Janet.

1272
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,184
Morning.

1273
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,190
So where's the tape?

1274
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,360
There's some pretty ugly stuff
on that tape.

1275
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:53,197
- Yes, there is.
- Who would've thought?

1276
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:59,161
- Where did it come from?
- Landed on my front door last night.

1277
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:00,663
- No note.
- Vail?

1278
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:03,374
- Who else?
- Clever prick.

1279
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:06,502
What do you think he's up to?

1280
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,171
- I honestly don't know.
- Cut the crap, Janet.

1281
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:12,424
You know him pretty goddamn well.
You were balling him, for Christ's sake.

1282
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:16,679
- Where is it?
- At home.

1283
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:22,143
I have some advice for you.

1284
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:26,522
My advice for you, if you really have
aspirations beyond this particular office,

1285
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:30,401
is to pick up that little handbag of yours,
go home right now and destroy this tape

1286
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,320
you should've destroyed, like I did,
the minute you received it.

1287
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,740
You don't think Vail has a copy?

1288
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:39,493
You don't think there's an original?

1289
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:46,375
It's Stampler that's on trial,
not the Catholic Church,

1290
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,920
and if you haven't found another motive
to hang him on, then God help you.

1291
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:02,641
All rise.

1292
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,520
Please, sit down.

1293
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:12,902
Madam Prosecutor.

1294
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,993
Miss Venable.

1295
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:24,622
The State calls Thomas Goodman.

1296
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,791
Objection, Your Honor.

1297
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,043
Prosecution knows full well

1298
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,754
that Mr. Goodman is my investigator
in this case,

1299
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:35,007
and under the Work Product Rule,
he can't be compelled to testify.

1300
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:36,550
Permission to approach the bench,
Your Honor?

1301
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:37,885
Granted.

1302
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:46,644
Important evidence has just
come into my possession

1303
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,646
which I believe
this witness can authenticate.

1304
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,149
That's Mr. Vail's privilege. If Mr. Vail
doesn't want Mr. Goodman to testify,

1305
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,068
Mr. Goodman doesn't testify.

1306
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,819
Make a decision, Mr. Vail.

1307
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:02,159
Mr. Goodman, have you ever been
to my apartment?

1308
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,954
- No.
- By that I mean my apartment building.

1309
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:06,914
Allegedly.

1310
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:09,583
I'm sorry, you're confused.
Either you have or you haven't.

1311
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,669
"Allegedly" doesn't figure into it.

1312
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,589
I have been there, yes.

1313
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:19,343
- Why did you go there?
- I was delivering something.

1314
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:20,636
For whom?

1315
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,348
Martin Vail.

1316
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,894
Mr. Vail sent you
to deliver something to me.

1317
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,688
- Yes.
- What was it?

1318
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,275
A videotape.

1319
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:37,486
Could this have been the tape
you delivered for Mr. Vail?

1320
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,655
I have a feeling it is, yes.

1321
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,949
The People place
this half- inch videocassette tape

1322
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,785
- in evidence, Your Honor.
- So ordered. Bailiff, please index.

1323
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:49,039
Now, where did Mr. Vail get this tape,
if it is indeed the same one?

1324
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:53,335
He took it from the closet
of Archbishop Rushman.

1325
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,170
- He stole it.
- No, no, he borrowed it.

1326
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:58,132
Once I made the transfer for him,
I returned it, so...

1327
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:01,760
Can you describe for me
what's on this tape?

1328
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:04,847
There was a sermon
by Archbishop Rushman on it,

1329
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:08,350
a rehearsal of a sermon, I should say,
followed by

1330
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:15,149
- a kind of home movie.
- A home movie? Of what?

1331
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,401
- Some altar boys.
- And?

1332
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,571
- A girl.
- Doing what?

1333
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:25,534
An altar- boy lesson of some kind?

1334
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,538
Having sex.

1335
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,499
Quiet.

1336
01:34:33,043 --> 01:34:34,501
A porno movie.

1337
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:38,005
- Yes.
- Yes. Now.

1338
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:43,010
How is it, do you think,
that this tape, this porno tape,

1339
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:47,222
was in the Archbishop's closet
in order for Mr. Vail to find it there?

1340
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:51,352
- He was the... The director.
- Who was?

1341
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:54,438
- Archbishop Rushman.
- Quiet in the court!

1342
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,902
And was the defendant
one of the altar boys

1343
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:02,780
performing in the Archbishop's
home movie?

1344
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:06,241
- Yes, he was.
- Was his girlfriend?

1345
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:08,577
I believe her name is Linda Forbes.

1346
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:10,788
Yes, she was.

1347
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,750
And did it appear to you
that the defendant was enjoying

1348
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:17,669
performing in this film
with his girlfriend?

1349
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,880
No, he does not.

1350
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,257
I will not ask you, Mr. Goodman,

1351
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:25,219
if you think we have just
uncovered motive here.

1352
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:28,806
We will decide that for ourselves
once we've all seen the videotape.

1353
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,600
No further questions.

1354
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,271
Does Defense wish to cross?

1355
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:42,861
- No, Your Honor.
- Court's in recess.

1356
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:46,407
Bailiff, please set up for the tape.
Mr. Goodman, you're excused.

1357
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,830
Thanks for the advice.

1358
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:02,548
- Mr. Vail said she was your girlfriend.
- Yes. Yes, she was.

1359
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:06,009
- How'd you meet?
- We was both at the Savior House.

1360
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:10,180
I was an altar boy,

1361
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:15,686
and she was working
for Bishop Rushman.

1362
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:16,937
Doing what?

1363
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,863
Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?

1364
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,575
- No.
- Was she?

1365
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,370
No.

1366
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:37,541
Has she been to see you, Aaron?

1367
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:42,254
- Yeah? No, I'm still here.
- No.

1368
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,717
- What?
- Does that upset you?

1369
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:10,407
Okay.

1370
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:33,138
Mr. Vail, are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness?

1371
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:49,071
Yes, Your Honor.
The Defense calls John Shaughnessy.

1372
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,036
The People object, Your Honor.

1373
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,121
Mr. Shaughnessy has never been
identified as a possible witness.

1374
01:37:58,206 --> 01:37:59,998
- Your Honor, may I approach?
- Yes, you may.

1375
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:01,458
Thank you.

1376
01:38:05,046 --> 01:38:08,215
My client is on trial for his life, here.
He's always maintained that there was

1377
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:10,968
- someone else in that bedroom.
- And you think Mr. Shaughnessy

1378
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,344
can somehow confirm that?

1379
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,388
Your Honor,
the Constitution of the United States

1380
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:15,889
takes precedence here,

1381
01:38:15,974 --> 01:38:19,059
permitting the calling of any witness
to promulgate evidence of innocence.

1382
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,520
That's clearly stated
in the Sixth Amendment.

1383
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,939
It's also profound in Brady vs. Maryland.

1384
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:28,485
Mr. Shaughnessy,
do you serve on the board

1385
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,446
of an organization known
as the Rushman Foundation?

1386
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,657
I have the privilege to be
an honorary board member.

1387
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,827
Could you briefly explain the nature
and purpose of this foundation?

1388
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:39,788
The Rushman Foundation was founded
by the late archbishop.

1389
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:44,251
Its purpose is to invest in projects
for the greater good of the community.

1390
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,670
The greater good
of the community, okay.

1391
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:51,633
Now, would that be true
in the case of the now bankrupt

1392
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:54,761
- South River Housing Development?
- Yes.

1393
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:59,141
Could you tell the court why the
South River project was abandoned?

1394
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:02,352
There was a difference of opinion
as to the costs.

1395
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:05,063
Wasn't there also
a difference of opinion

1396
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:08,442
between the investors
and the late archbishop himself?

1397
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,528
- I don't recall.
- Well...

1398
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:15,532
What kind of money
are we talking about here? I mean...

1399
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,871
How much money, Mr. Shaughnessy,

1400
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:25,834
was invested in this failed
South River enterprise?

1401
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,299
- $60 million.
- Quiet.

1402
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:34,760
$60 million!

1403
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:38,263
Wow, that's a lot of money.

1404
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,643
You and the Archbishop
have been friends for, what, 20 years?

1405
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:45,145
I think it's safe to say the two of you
knew each other really well.

1406
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,229
That's right.

1407
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:48,106
Were you surprised at the content
of that tape

1408
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,150
- that Miss Venable submitted?
- Yes, of course I was.

1409
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,152
So you've never heard any allegations,

1410
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,321
charges against the Archbishop
during that time?

1411
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,864
Not that I recall, no.

1412
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:59,326
No, especially since you were the
State's Attorney for the last 15 years,

1413
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,663
it'd be fair to say that you've supervised
all the prosecutions

1414
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,289
in Cook County during that time,

1415
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:07,334
especially the prosecutions
of all the prominent figures.

1416
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:10,629
I also have a staff of 1,000
of the best prosecutors...

1417
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:15,717
Yeah, yeah, but as State's Attorney,
it was up to you, ultimately, to decide

1418
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:17,344
who would be indicted
and who wouldn't.

1419
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,096
- Yes.
- Yeah. Okay.

1420
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:24,017
Let me just take you back now.

1421
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:28,730
Let's go back to June, 1985.

1422
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:32,484
Do you recall any allegations
of sexual misconduct

1423
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:36,029
- against the Archbishop at that time?
- I don't recall that, no.

1424
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:40,492
No? Do you recall a young man
by the name of Michael O'Donnell

1425
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:45,122
who came to the felony review unit
at your office?

1426
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,211
I have no idea what you're talking about,

1427
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:52,671
- Counselor.
- You don't?

1428
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,381
This is so confusing to me,

1429
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:57,384
because I have this document here

1430
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,761
from the Chicago Metropolitan
Police Department,

1431
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:03,890
and it says that, yes, Michael O'Donnell
spoke to the supervisor of that unit

1432
01:41:03,975 --> 01:41:07,728
over a period of two weeks,
explaining to him, in graphic detail,

1433
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:11,440
sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of Archbishop Rushman.

1434
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:12,524
Quiet.

1435
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:16,737
Isn’t it also true, Mr. State's Attorney,
that you then decided that your friend,

1436
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:20,323
Archbishop Rushman,
was not going to stand trial for any of it?

1437
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,994
He owed you big time, John.

1438
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:27,831
You must have been really pissed off
when he pulled out of South River.

1439
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,332
What happened? What was it?

1440
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:32,043
He just finally said,
"I can't take it anymore"? He said, "No!"

1441
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,463
- Mr. Vail.
- So you and your investors...

1442
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,798
- Mr. Vail.
- ...had 60 million reasons to kill him!

1443
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:39,384
- You little cocksucker!
- That's it. Witness dismissed.

1444
01:41:39,469 --> 01:41:42,095
This court's in recess.
Vail, in my chambers now.

1445
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,056
That's for Joey Pinero,
you little shithead.

1446
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:50,854
Start looking for a job.

1447
01:42:00,907 --> 01:42:04,576
If you think you can use my courtroom
to wage personal vendettas

1448
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:07,704
and settle old scores,
you are sorely mistaken.

1449
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:11,583
I'm striking Shaughnessy's testimony
from the record as irrelevant,

1450
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:14,544
and I'm holding you in contempt
to the tune of $10,000.

1451
01:42:15,213 --> 01:42:18,799
So what you're telling me is, I can't get
a fair trial in your courtroom, is that it?

1452
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:22,511
Be very, very careful, Mr. Vail.
You're on dangerous ground here.

1453
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,305
Fine, fine. You want me to make
that check out to you, Judge?

1454
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,599
Do you want me
to take you off this case?

1455
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:31,603
You're making a mockery of my
courtroom, and I'm not going to allow it.

1456
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:36,900
I suggest you start representing your
client and stop representing yourself.

1457
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:47,035
...do this later?

1458
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,913
No, I want to stay with this for a minute.

1459
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:55,085
- I'm feeling very, very tired.
- Yeah, I know.

1460
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:58,088
Why does talking
about Linda Forbes upset you?

1461
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:00,841
It doesn't. I just...

1462
01:43:01,968 --> 01:43:05,136
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1463
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:10,892
Hey, you know what I can do
with this thing?

1464
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:12,769
How the fuck should I know?

1465
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:25,866
Dr. Arrington, how much time
have you spent with Aaron Stampler?

1466
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:27,617
Around 60 hours.

1467
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:30,537
And what did you find
in the course of your evaluation?

1468
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:34,374
I found that Mr. Stampler suffers from
an acute disassociative condition,

1469
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,877
specifically,
multiple personality disorder.

1470
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:38,128
Objection, Your Honor.

1471
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:41,214
Now, Dr. Arrington is only stating what
she herself has personally observed.

1472
01:43:41,299 --> 01:43:43,174
- Your Honor.
- Counselors.

1473
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:48,138
- Now, I know what you're doing.
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

1474
01:43:50,808 --> 01:43:52,809
Your Honor, if he wants to question
his client's sanity...

1475
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:56,187
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia here.

1476
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:59,399
That is not what he's doing.
He's saying he's crazy.

1477
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:03,320
- Are you?
- No, I am not.

1478
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:07,574
I'll allow you to proceed with
this witness if you're very, very careful.

1479
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:10,827
Absolutely. Yes.

1480
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:13,038
Write down that he said that.

1481
01:44:13,539 --> 01:44:15,040
All right, where were we?

1482
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:24,132
Now, could Aaron Stampler

1483
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:28,762
have been present during the murder
of Archbishop Rushman

1484
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:30,847
- and not remember it?
- Yes, he could.

1485
01:44:30,932 --> 01:44:33,016
Okay. Could you explain that, please?

1486
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:35,769
Mr. Stampler's state at the time
of the offense was such that

1487
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:37,938
his body could be present at a homicide

1488
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,440
and yet his mind
would be unable to recall it.

1489
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:43,360
- And how is that possible?
- The neurological mechanism

1490
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:46,196
that would make this possible
began with the early abuse

1491
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,031
suffered at the hands of his father.

1492
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,533
In defense, Aaron's psyche splintered

1493
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:53,578
and helped him to create
two separate personalities.

1494
01:44:53,663 --> 01:44:55,705
- Your Honor.
- I didn't say it.

1495
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,458
- I did not say it...
- You've been warned twice now.

1496
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:00,502
Do you really wanna pursue
this line of questioning?

1497
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:04,047
And I suggest you think long and hard
before answering.

1498
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:09,260
Your Honor, just one last question.

1499
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:16,226
All right, Dr. Arrington,

1500
01:45:17,687 --> 01:45:22,649
in your opinion,
is Aaron Stampler capable of murder?

1501
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,567
No, he is not. He is far too traumatized

1502
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:26,820
to express normal anger and frustration.

1503
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,989
He keeps his emotions repressed,

1504
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:31,658
which is why he created Roy,
who is capable of such a crime.

1505
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,244
- Objection, Your Honor.
- That's enough, Mr. Vail.

1506
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:38,039
The jury will disregard this witness'
last statement, as will the court.

1507
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:39,416
- Thank you very much.
- Madam Prosecutor,

1508
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,043
- do you wish to cross?
- You bet I do.

1509
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:47,841
Since you brought it up,
against the instructions of the court,

1510
01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:49,342
I'm curious to know,

1511
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:52,846
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise?

1512
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,973
It's not my primary field, no.

1513
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:58,601
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?

1514
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,604
- No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
- I see.

1515
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:04,941
So you have no forensic experience,

1516
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:08,611
and you're more of, let's say,
an academic?

1517
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:13,283
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.

1518
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:16,995
I'm driving in my car,
somebody cuts me off.

1519
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:19,039
I think to myself,
"I could just kill that guy,"

1520
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:20,707
but I don't, now do I?

1521
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,625
- I would hope not.
- That's right.

1522
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:26,379
Things happen to us. People wrong us,

1523
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,923
but we don't all go around
inventing psychopaths

1524
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:31,009
to do our dirty work for us,
now, do we, Doctor?

1525
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:34,262
I'm not suggesting you suffer from
multiple personality, Miss Venable.

1526
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:37,223
- I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.
- Yes, I know. We heard.

1527
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:43,480
You have also testified
that you have met this...

1528
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:44,898
What was his name again?

1529
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,399
- Roy.
- Roy what?

1530
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:49,235
- He didn't give a last name.
- I see.

1531
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:53,406
Did this Roy tell you
that he had murdered the Archbishop?

1532
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:56,117
Mr. Vail was alone with him at the time.
I was watching through the window,

1533
01:46:56,202 --> 01:46:59,370
but soon after that I was in the room
and saw both Roy

1534
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,790
and his transformation back to Aaron.

1535
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:08,254
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron...

1536
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:14,177
I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I just cannot get used to this name.

1537
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:16,679
- Roy.
- Did you?

1538
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:21,184
- No, the tape was off.
- Off?

1539
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:28,399
So you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance.

1540
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:29,943
- No.
- No.

1541
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:35,115
Does Aaron Stampler know
the difference between right and wrong?

1542
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,241
Yes, he does.

1543
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:39,077
If Aaron Stampler butchered
the Archbishop, would he know...

1544
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:40,286
Objection, Your Honor.

1545
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:43,748
If Aaron Stampler
murdered the Archbishop,

1546
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:48,253
- would he know he'd broken the law?
- Yes, he would, but it wasn't Aaron...

1547
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:52,465
Yes, I know, Doctor. It was Roy.

1548
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:59,055
That's all.
No further questions, Your Honor.

1549
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,640
Witness may step down.

1550
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:03,726
Miss Venable, if you would like to
re- open the Prosecution's case

1551
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:05,311
and call the State's psychiatrist,

1552
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:08,565
- I will certainly agree to it.
- No, I...

1553
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:10,233
I don't think that's necessary,
Your Honor.

1554
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,068
I think we all get the picture here.

1555
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:16,322
Mr. Vail, are you ready to proceed?

1556
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:20,910
Would you like a recess?

1557
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:27,310
Roy?

1558
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:29,979
Aaron.

1559
01:49:33,943 --> 01:49:36,027
Could you tell us a little about
your relationship

1560
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,987
with Archbishop Rushman?

1561
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:43,284
Well, he was like a father to me.
I loved him very much.

1562
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,078
Why did you love him?

1563
01:49:45,663 --> 01:49:46,829
Why?

1564
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:52,085
Well, he saved my life.

1565
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:57,298
He was the only person who ever
treated me like I was worth anything.

1566
01:49:57,675 --> 01:50:00,426
Stop your whining, you little girl.
Be a man.

1567
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:07,517
Now, we've all seen that tape
that you were in, Aaron.

1568
01:50:08,477 --> 01:50:09,852
How did that make you feel?

1569
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:12,730
Did it change your feelings
about Archbishop Rushman?

1570
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,023
No.

1571
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:18,194
He was a wonderful man.

1572
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:19,904
So you didn't feel anger towards him

1573
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:22,365
about being forced to perform
in that tape?

1574
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,869
No, he did everything for me.

1575
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,123
There wasn't nothing else
I could do for him, and he needed it.

1576
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,458
Do you know someone named Roy?

1577
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:36,879
No, I don't.

1578
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,425
You heard Dr. Arrington's
testimony about

1579
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:42,760
what she and I saw there at the jail.

1580
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:46,055
Aaron, some pretty strange things
going on there. Do you remember?

1581
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,516
I heard what she said,
but I don't remember any of that.

1582
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,435
- No recollection?
- No, sir.

1583
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:52,854
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?

1584
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:56,733
No, sir, I did not.

1585
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:03,781
Thank you.

1586
01:51:06,618 --> 01:51:08,077
Your witness.

1587
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:18,212
Mr. Stampler,
would you like some water?

1588
01:51:22,217 --> 01:51:24,761
- No, ma'am.
- You sure?

1589
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,473
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1590
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:40,526
Mr. Stampler, did you believe
that the Archbishop wore masks?

1591
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,782
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1592
01:51:46,075 --> 01:51:50,203
Do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private?

1593
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:53,247
No, I didn't think that.

1594
01:51:54,083 --> 01:51:56,459
Isn’t that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?

1595
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:00,421
Mr. Stampler?

1596
01:52:03,384 --> 01:52:05,343
No, I did not underline that book.

1597
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:08,137
- You didn't underline it?
- No, ma'am.

1598
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:11,766
And you didn't carve the numbers
referring to that passage into his chest?

1599
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:15,728
No, no, ma'am, I did not. I told you I...

1600
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:17,313
You loved him.

1601
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:20,858
You loved him like a father.

1602
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:24,654
Even though he made you
and your girlfriend

1603
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:28,157
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification.

1604
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,952
No, you don't understand. He...

1605
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:36,082
There was no other way for him
to cast out his own demons.

1606
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,709
- He needed it.
- He needed to get off, Aaron.

1607
01:52:38,794 --> 01:52:40,128
That's what he was doing.

1608
01:52:40,212 --> 01:52:44,424
That's what he needed you for,
to perform like a circus animal.

1609
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:47,218
- That was your function in his life.
- No.

1610
01:52:47,302 --> 01:52:51,097
Mr. Stampler, I'm gonna ask you
straight, because I am tired,

1611
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:53,641
and I've had just about
all I can take of this sordidness,

1612
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:54,934
and I wanna go home,

1613
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:59,272
and I wanna wash my hands,
and I wanna forget all about you

1614
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:01,441
and Archbishop Rushman.

1615
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:05,361
Did the Archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others

1616
01:53:05,446 --> 01:53:09,282
to perform sexual acts
while he watched? Yes or no?

1617
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:15,121
- Yes, he did, but...
- Yes. Yes, he forced you.

1618
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:19,208
He forced you using a threat
of expulsion from Savior House

1619
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:23,671
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food.

1620
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:27,842
He put you in front of a camera!
He made you take off your clothes!

1621
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:30,678
And you don't think that
that's another side?

1622
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:32,930
Another face of a man
that we all thought...

1623
01:53:33,015 --> 01:53:34,891
- No! No.
- Do you know what I would do

1624
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:37,477
if someone did that to me?
I would kill him. I wouldn't hesitate.

1625
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:39,020
- No.
- I would stab him

1626
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:40,897
78 times with a butcher knife!

1627
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:44,150
I would chop off his fingers!
I would slash his throat open!

1628
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:45,985
I would carve numbers into his chest!

1629
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:49,113
I would gouge out his eyes!
I swear to God.

1630
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:52,742
But that's me.

1631
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:03,002
No further questions, Your Honor.

1632
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:04,504
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

1633
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:05,796
- Excuse me?
- Hey, you look at me

1634
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:08,257
- when I'm talking to you, bitch!
- Mr. Stampler.

1635
01:54:08,342 --> 01:54:10,092
- Fuck you, lady! Come here!
- That's it.

1636
01:54:10,177 --> 01:54:12,053
Order! Bailiff! Order!

1637
01:54:13,138 --> 01:54:17,558
Come here! You wanna play rough?
Let's play rough. Come on. Back off!

1638
01:54:17,643 --> 01:54:20,102
- Roy! Take it easy.
- Keep coming, asshole.

1639
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:22,188
You'll see if I don't break
her fucking neck.

1640
01:54:22,272 --> 01:54:24,023
- Roy, come here. I gotta talk to you.
- Fuck you, Marty!

1641
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,567
- I'm walking out of here. Now, slow...
- It's me.

1642
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:34,033
No! No! Don't you...

1643
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,619
No!

1644
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,835
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1645
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:14,615
Don't even think of lighting
that cigarette, Miss Venable.

1646
01:55:20,664 --> 01:55:23,332
- How's your neck?
- I'll live.

1647
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:25,209
I could call a doctor.

1648
01:55:25,711 --> 01:55:30,798
Mr. Shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial,

1649
01:55:30,882 --> 01:55:33,217
- as if that was his right.
- I can't believe

1650
01:55:33,302 --> 01:55:35,678
that scumbag has the balls to call here.

1651
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,013
No, thanks.

1652
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,890
What matters to me is
what you have to say.

1653
01:55:39,975 --> 01:55:42,393
Obviously,
your case has been damaged.

1654
01:55:43,937 --> 01:55:46,772
In fairness to the Prosecution,
I would declare a mistrial,

1655
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:49,525
regardless of what
Monsieurs Shaughnessy and Vail think,

1656
01:55:49,610 --> 01:55:51,068
if that's what you want.

1657
01:55:51,153 --> 01:55:54,155
The Prosecution doesn't wanna try
this case again, even if it could,

1658
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:57,283
which it can't, at least not by me.

1659
01:55:57,367 --> 01:56:00,202
And I think I can guarantee you
there's no one

1660
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:05,708
in the DA's office who will,
so it's up to you.

1661
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:08,669
I'm going to dismiss the jury
in favor of a bench trial

1662
01:56:08,754 --> 01:56:11,297
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity.

1663
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:12,882
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1664
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:14,967
The defendant will be
remanded to Elgin

1665
01:56:15,052 --> 01:56:17,053
for an evaluation period of 30 days.

1666
01:56:17,137 --> 01:56:19,472
Let them decide
the term of his commitment.

1667
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:21,015
Do either of you have
a problem with that?

1668
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:22,767
Your Honor, he'll be out in a month.

1669
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:25,853
Take it up with the Legislature,
Miss Venable.

1670
01:56:28,857 --> 01:56:30,399
I'm going home.

1671
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,239
- Your Honor.
- No, Mr. Vail,

1672
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:39,784
I am not refunding your contempt fine,

1673
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:42,328
and the next time you wanna get
a client off on insanity,

1674
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:43,871
you plead that way,

1675
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:46,082
or I'll have you disbarred.

1676
01:57:14,695 --> 01:57:19,073
- You okay?
- Am I okay? Do I seem okay?

1677
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,993
I get attacked by this sick twist,
I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.

1678
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:26,831
No, Marty. I'm not particularly okay,
but, hey, you won,

1679
01:57:26,915 --> 01:57:29,875
justice was done.
Who the hell cares, right?

1680
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,003
Congratulations.

1681
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:41,178
You knew, didn't you?

1682
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:44,390
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out up there.

1683
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:48,227
Well, I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.

1684
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,563
And who better to do that than me?

1685
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:53,232
You used me.

1686
01:57:57,446 --> 01:57:59,572
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.

1687
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,619
What did I use, by the way,
that was so terrible?

1688
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:09,749
I knew you'd do your job.
I knew you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.

1689
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:12,877
I knew you'd try to win the case.
Now, what's wrong with that?

1690
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:14,754
I lost my fucking job!

1691
01:58:14,838 --> 01:58:16,547
And that's good.
You should've left him years ago.

1692
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:19,592
Christ, Marty, why is it you always think
you know what's right for me?

1693
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:21,135
Because I'm arrogant.

1694
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,555
I'm very,

1695
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:28,350
very arrogant.

1696
01:58:39,196 --> 01:58:41,030
- You wanna dance?
- No.

1697
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:43,991
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1698
01:58:47,287 --> 01:58:49,705
All you have to do is turn around.

1699
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:56,420
No.

1700
01:58:58,548 --> 01:58:59,715
No.

1701
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:11,268
I have to see my client.

1702
01:59:54,855 --> 01:59:57,231
- I'd like a minute alone with him.
- Are you sure?

1703
01:59:57,315 --> 01:59:59,024
Yeah. I'm sure.

1704
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:12,037
You okay?

1705
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,459
My head hurts.

1706
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:21,630
You don't remember
what just happened?

1707
02:00:24,968 --> 02:00:30,014
- No?
- I lost time again.

1708
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:33,517
Well, I got some good news.

1709
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:36,562
They've agreed to stop the trial.

1710
02:00:36,646 --> 02:00:39,231
They're gonna be sending you
to a hospital.

1711
02:00:39,733 --> 02:00:41,358
You can get the help you need.

1712
02:00:43,278 --> 02:00:48,157
Now, there's a very good chance
you can get out someday soon.

1713
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:52,703
Yeah.

1714
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:59,209
I can't believe it.

1715
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:04,340
- I don't know what to say, Mr. Vail.
- That's all right, Aaron. That's okay.

1716
02:01:04,424 --> 02:01:07,301
I knew, the minute
you came into my cell,

1717
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:10,137
I knew everything was gonna be okay.

1718
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:12,848
You saved my life.

1719
02:01:16,853 --> 02:01:18,103
Yeah.

1720
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:21,315
I got to go.

1721
02:01:23,693 --> 02:01:28,405
- When will I see you again?
- Well, that's up to the courts now.

1722
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:33,786
I don't want you to worry, Aaron.
I'm gonna stay on top of this, okay?

1723
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:42,044
Thank you.

1724
02:01:43,296 --> 02:01:46,131
All right. You give me a call
if you need to. Okay?

1725
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:47,591
- I will.
- All right.

1726
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:52,930
- Hey, Mr. Vail?
- Yeah.

1727
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:58,936
Will you tell Miss Venable I'm sorry?

1728
02:02:00,772 --> 02:02:03,565
Tell her I hope her neck is okay.

1729
02:02:04,609 --> 02:02:05,734
Yeah.

1730
02:02:22,752 --> 02:02:26,255
- What did you just say?
- What?

1731
02:02:27,716 --> 02:02:30,718
You told me you don't remember.
You black out.

1732
02:02:34,264 --> 02:02:36,682
So how do you know about her neck?

1733
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:55,409
Well, good for you, Marty.

1734
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:58,954
I was gonna let it go.

1735
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:02,499
You was looking so happy just now.
I was thinking...

1736
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:06,045
But to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it,

1737
02:03:06,129 --> 02:03:08,714
'cause I have been dying to tell you.

1738
02:03:09,716 --> 02:03:11,675
I just didn't know who
you'd wanna hear it from, you know.

1739
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:14,803
I mean, Aaron or Roy, or Roy or Aaron.

1740
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:17,181
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret,

1741
02:03:17,265 --> 02:03:21,143
sort of a client- attorney privilege type
of a secret. You know what I mean?

1742
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:25,773
It don't matter who you hear it from.
It's the same story.

1743
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:33,489
I just

1744
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:35,657
had to kill Linda, Mr. Vail.

1745
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,787
That cunt just got what she deserved.

1746
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:47,211
But cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman,

1747
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,091
that was just a fucking work of art.

1748
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:02,726
You're good. You are really good.

1749
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,355
Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't I?

1750
02:04:10,568 --> 02:04:14,696
So there never...
There never was a Roy?

1751
02:04:16,032 --> 02:04:20,077
Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's
what you think, I'm disappointed in you.

1752
02:04:20,161 --> 02:04:21,787
I don't mind telling you.

1753
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:28,836
There never was an Aaron, Counselor.

1754
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:40,180
Come on, Marty, I thought you had it
figured there at the end.

1755
02:04:40,265 --> 02:04:41,640
The way you put me
on the stand like that,

1756
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:43,684
that was fucking brilliant, Marty.

1757
02:04:43,768 --> 02:04:45,352
And that whole thing,
that, "Act like a man,"

1758
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:47,646
Jesus, I knew exactly
what you wanted from me.

1759
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,857
It was like we were dancing, Marty!

1760
02:04:49,941 --> 02:04:52,401
- Guard.
- Come on. Don't be like that, Marty.

1761
02:04:53,862 --> 02:04:58,407
We did it, man. We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.

1762
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,451
You think I could've done this
without you?

1763
02:05:01,536 --> 02:05:03,036
You're just feeling a little anger here

1764
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:05,956
because you started to care about
old Aaron. I can understand that,

1765
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:10,127
but, you know, love hurts, Marty.
What can I say?

1766
02:05:11,045 --> 02:05:14,673
Hey, I'm just kidding, bud!
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!

1767
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:17,092
What else was I supposed to do?

1768
02:05:17,427 --> 02:05:18,927
Hey, you're gonna thank me
down the road,

1769
02:05:19,012 --> 02:05:21,930
'cause this is gonna toughen you
right up, Martin Vail!
