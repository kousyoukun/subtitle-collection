176
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,280
<i>And I was looking around</i>
<i>for a new project.</i>

177
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,920
<i>I was the first one</i>
<i>that came along and said,</i>

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,080
<i>"Could we make this even more public?"</i>

179
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>"Can we take this to another level?"</i>

180
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,320
<i>"I could probably</i>
<i>make something big out of this."</i>

181
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,680
<i>"There's a market for this story."</i>

182
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,880

<i>She spoke about being accepted by the pack</i>

<i>[Jane] I thought,</i>

<i>[howling]</i>

333
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,720
<i>[Jane] There it was. You could see.</i>

334
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,960
<i>There's the connection</i>
<i>between the human and the wolf.</i>

335
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,920
<i>[howling continues]</i>

336
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,520
<i>I saw it, you know. It was amazing.</i>
<i>It was a shocking moment.</i>

337
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,280
<i>So, they had got a lot</i>
<i>of really interesting wolf footage,</i>

338
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,600
<i>and I thought,</i>
<i>"This is gonna make a great </i>Oprah<i> show."</i>

339
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,400
<i>The next step was that she was to go</i>
<i>to Chicago for the studio portion.</i>

340
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,080
<i>[Soffron] Things were going</i>
<i>swimmingly well.</i>

341
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,680
<i>And then, I began to see some tension</i>

342
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,720
<i>between Misha and Jane.</i>

343
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,640
<i>[sighs]</i>

344
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,080
<i>It wasn't very pleasant as time went on.</i>

345
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,280
<i>[Pat] The book wasn't selling very well,</i>

346
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,520
<i>so Misha and Maurice, her husband,</i>
<i>were having financial difficulties.</i>

347
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,200
{\an8}<i>So then she started selling things,</i>
<i>from her house.</i>

348
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
{\an8}<i>And, um…</i>

349
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
{\an8}<i>I felt bad</i>
<i>that they were losing everything.</i>

350
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,200
<i>[Karen Schulman] She kept saying,</i>
<i>"I have no money. I have nothing."</i>

351
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>"Jane Daniel's no good."</i>

352
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,960
<i>I felt saddened,</i>

353
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,880
<i>but then Misha was sitting at my table</i>
<i>one night and said to me</i>

354
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,400
<i>she didn't wanna go on </i>Oprah Winfrey.

355
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,440
<i>I said, "Gee, Misha,</i>
<i>I don't understand that."</i>

356
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,400
<i>[Jane] All of a sudden,</i>
<i>Misha's not cooperative,</i>

<i>doesn't return phone calls,</i>
<i>has one objection after another.</i>

358
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,840
<i>She doesn't wanna go, it's inconvenient,</i>

359
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,640
<i>she needs somebody</i>
<i>to take care of her animals at home.</i>

<i>[cats meowing, purring]</i>

361
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,440
<i>[Defonseca] Jane made me so mad,</i>
<i>so insecure.</i>

362
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
<i>My husband said many times to her,</i>

363
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,440

365
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,560

<i>[Defonseca] Well, the memory,</i>

371
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,960

<i>[Jane] We tried everything.</i>

<i>It's like, "Oh, my God."</i>
<i>And at that point, everything stopped.</i>

<i>No other country</i>
<i>wanted to do business with us.</i>

387

<i>We had a lawsuit attached to this project.</i>

388

<i>[Ramona Hamblin]</i>
<i>The first time I met Misha,</i>

389
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,200
<i>I felt very compelled</i>
<i>by the circumstances of the case.</i>

<i>[tense music playing]</i>

391
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,640
<i>It was clear to me</i>

392
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,160
{\an8}<i>that several things had, um, been done</i>
<i>that were improper, illegal, fraudulent.</i>

393
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,920
<i>Misha was asking for the return</i>
<i>of the copyright to her name</i>

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,160
<i>and for all of the royalties</i>
<i>that she was due for book sales.</i>

395
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,440
<i>Jane Daniel saw in my life a gold mine,</i>

396
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,320
<i>and she took advantage of it.</i>

397
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,920
<i>[Hamblin]</i>
<i>There was so much anger and bitterness</i>

398
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,600
<i>between the parties</i>
<i>by the time that I got involved,</i>

399
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,320
<i>there was not much room for negotiation.</i>

400
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,760
<i>And it was clear</i>
<i>we were gonna be going to trial.</i>

401
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,360
<i>It wasn't gonna settle out of court.</i>

402

<i>[sinuous music playing]</i>

403
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,400
<i>[Soffron] The sense in the courtroom</i>

404
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,000
<i>The atmosphere was pretty tense.</i>

405
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,400
<i>And then, of course, the money comes up.</i>

406
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,160
<i>[Hamblin] We found that Jane Daniel had</i>
<i>set up a company in the Turks and Caicos,</i>

407
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,080
<i>so that royalties that came from overseas</i>

408
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,120
<i>went directly into her account</i>
<i>and never paid royalties on them.</i>

409
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,320
<i>We had documentation.</i>

410
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,960
<i>We had royalty statements</i>
<i>to show that she was paid.</i>

411
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,360
<i>We had canceled checks</i>
<i>that showed that she was paid.</i>

412
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,680
<i>So everything she was saying,</i>
<i>we had documentation to refute.</i>

413
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,360
<i>But she could speak no falsehood.</i>

414
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,240
<i>You know, "Where's the money?"</i>
<i>And I think the jury was very sympathetic.</i>

<i>[sinuous music continues]</i>

416
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,520
<i>[Hamblin] The jury was riveted.</i>

<i>In front of you is a person</i>
<i>who'd survived the Holocaust as a child</i>

418

<i>and written a memoir about it.</i>

419
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,960
<i>They were engaged</i>
<i>and absolutely enthralled by this story.</i>

420
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,480
<i>Misha was a good witness.</i>

421
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,080
<i>All what I lived is on the manuscript,</i>

422
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,560
<i>because it's my life.</i>

423
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,240
<i>[sinuous music continues]</i>

00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,880
<i>[Jane huffs]</i>
<i>It just made me look like a monster.</i>

425
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
<i>And I thought, "This is not going well."</i>

426
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,560
<i>Jane was always fighting.</i>
<i>She enforced what she want.</i>

427
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,600
<i>[Jane] It was a ten-day trial,</i>
<i>and it was grueling.</i>

428

<i>The judge asks the jury,</i>
<i>"How do you find on count one?"</i>

429
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,760
<i>The jury found unanimously for Misha</i>
<i>on all counts.</i>

430
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,720
<i>I mean, ultimately, they came in</i>
<i>with a massive judgment against me.</i>

431
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,480
<i>It was kind of mind-boggling</i>
<i>to hear the number.</i>

432
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,480
<i>22.5 million.</i>

433
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,120
<i>So it was a very large verdict.</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>There were things</i>

<i>to really elevate the level of damages</i>

<i>well beyond what would seem</i>
<i>supportable for a book like this.</i>

446

<i>[rain pattering softly]</i>

492
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,120
<i>It was the dead of winter.</i>
<i>The days were short.</i>

493
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,120
<i>I was standing in my kitchen,</i>

494
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
<i>and I thought, "I have to do something.</i>
<i>I have to do something."</i>

495
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,800
<i>[suspenseful music plays]</i>

496
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,920
<i>[Jane] I started recalling</i>
<i>all the things that had happened.</i>

497
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,160
<i>How I had met her, what had happened then,</i>
<i>what happened this…</i>

498
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,800
<i>How did the lawsuit come about?</i>

499
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,520
<i>And then I thought,</i>

500
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,760
<i>"I'll write a book about the case.</i>
<i>I'll do it as a blog."</i>

501
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,040
<i>I was writing my memoir of her memoir.</i>

502
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,880
<i>And maybe somebody will read it.</i>

503
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,320
<i>Talk about a long shot.</i>

504
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,680
<i>[keyboard clacking]</i>

505
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,560
<i>The next day, I get up,</i>

506
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,280
<i>I turn on my computer,</i>
<i>and there's an e-mail.</i>

507
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,240
<i>And the e-mail says…</i>

508
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,280
<i>[Sharon Sergeant]</i>
<i>"</i>I think I might be able to help find out

509
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,160
<i>what's the real story."</i>

510
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,600
<i>I did a timeline of Misha</i>
<i>from a variety of photographs.</i>

511
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,160
<i>First from the book,</i>

512
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,120
<i>and then from other images</i>
<i>on the Internet.</i>

513
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,880
<i>So I could get a sense of her life.</i>

514
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,680
<i>I wanted to know who she was.</i>

515
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,680
{\an8}<i>Who is this person</i>
<i>that has just ruined my life?</i>

516
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,160
{\an8}<i>Each photograph I tried to analyze</i>

517
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,320
{\an8}<i>and see what kind of information</i>
<i>I could squeeze out of it.</i>

518
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,600
<i>[suspenseful music playing]</i>

519
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,360
{\an8}<i>The first clue was</i>
<i>Misha claims she was seven years old</i>

520
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,760
<i>when she was taken in</i>
<i>by this foster family.</i>

521
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,800
<i>In the American book</i>
<i>there was a series</i>

522
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,160
<i>of what they call polyphoto images.</i>

523
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,080
<i>And the polyphotos were taken</i>
<i>at that time.</i>

524
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,760
<i>And I looked at the photos,</i>
<i>and I said, [clicks tongue]</i>

525
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,360
<i>"No, this doesn't look like a 7-year-old."</i>

526
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,920
{\an8}<i>"This looks like a toddler,</i>
<i>a three or four-year-old."</i>

527
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,280
{\an8}<i>Big bow in her hair,</i>
<i>frilly clothes and chubby, chubby cheeks.</i>

528
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

529
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,160
<i>[suspenseful music rising]</i>

530
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,720
<i>The next photograph I looked at</i>

531
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,000
<i>was a picture who Misha said was</i>
<i>her foster grandfather and grandmother.</i>

532
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,320
<i>According to the narrative,</i>
<i>he's a rustic farm man.</i>

533
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,400
<i>I did a close-up of the hands</i>
<i>of Grandfather, which were manicured.</i>

534
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,800
{\an8}<i>Did not look like a farm person's hands.</i>

535
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,040
{\an8}<i>And he had a ring on one of his fingers.</i>

536
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,360
<i>Yeah, it was not the kind of thing</i>
<i>a farmer would wear.</i>

537
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>And then the little dog</i>
<i>on Grandmother's lap,</i>

538
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,960
{\an8}<i>that looks like a little house dog,</i>
<i>not a farm dog.</i>

539
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,080
<i>So I thought, "Gee, that's strange."</i>

540
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,880
{\an8}<i>And that's when I started comparing</i>
<i>the French and the American book.</i>

541
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,160
<i>I was looking at names</i>
<i>and places and dates.</i>

542
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,720
<i>That was the big red flag.</i>

543
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,680
<i>[Jane] She called me and she said,</i>

544
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,960
<i>"Do you notice that Misha's name</i>
<i>that she used in the French book</i>

545
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,600
<i>is different from the name</i>
<i>she used in the American book?"</i>

546
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,360
{\an8}<i>In the American book,</i>
<i>the name that she was given</i>

547
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,480
<i>by the foster family that took her in</i>
<i>was de Wael.</i>

548
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,720
<i>What Sharon noticed immediately is</i>
<i>the French book,</i>

549
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,520
<i>the foster family gave her</i>
<i>the name Valle, V-A-L-L-E.</i>

550
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,840
<i>Why would you have two different names?</i>

551
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,720
<i>[suspenseful music continues]</i>

552
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,480
<i>[Sharon] There's too many discrepancies,</i>

553
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,120
<i>between the name changes,</i>
<i>the pictures, and so on.</i>

554

<i>[music climaxes]</i>

555
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,880
<i>Fishy, yep. Definitely seemed fishy.</i>

<i>[director] Take a drink if you want.</i>
<i>Just relax.</i>

557
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,560
<i>I know it's a nerve-wracking thing.</i>

558
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,160
<i>[Jane] If her story were true</i>
<i>and I were doubting it…</i>

559
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,680
<i>there's something particularly</i>

560
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,680
<i>vicious</i>

561
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,160
<i>to</i>

562
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
<i>doubt somebody who's telling the truth</i>

563
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,880
<i>about something awful</i>
<i>that happened to them</i>

564
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,240
<i>and the callousness that it takes to say,</i>
<i>"I don't believe you."</i>

565
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,680
<i>And the harm you can cause by doing that.</i>

566
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,520
<i>That was in my mind.</i>

567
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,920
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>what was also in my mind is,</i>

568
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,680
<i>"So many discrepancies."</i>

569
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,040
<i>Why would you be saying things</i>
<i>that aren't true, unless you're crazy?</i>

570
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,160
<i>Maybe she's so traumatized</i>
<i>that she's just lost her grip on reality.</i>

571
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,400
<i>How much did that explain? I didn't know.</i>

572
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,520
<i>I needed a lot of answers at that point.</i>

{\an8}<i>[tense music playing]</i>

576
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,640
<i>[Jane] Sharon had a connection</i>
<i>with a Belgian genealogist</i>

577
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
<i>who herself was a Holocaust survivor.</i>

578
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,280
<i>As it turns out,</i>

579
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,680
<i>she grew up in the same area</i>
<i>that Misha claims to have lived in.</i>

580
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,960
<i>During the war,</i>
<i>I myself was a hidden child.</i>

581
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,600
<i>I went to a Catholic school,</i>

582
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,280
<i>and I became a very good</i>
<i>little Belgian, Catholic girl.</i>

583
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,760
<i>I have no recollection</i>
<i>of anybody telling me</i>

<i>what happened to my parents.</i>

585
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,560
<i>I have no memory at all.</i>

<i>[gentle, dramatic music playing]</i>

587
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,840
<i>I was about 40 and went through</i>
<i>a sort of terrible breakdown…</i>

588
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,160
<i>which led me to find</i>
<i>what happened to me, in fact,</i>

589
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,960
{\an8}<i>and to my parents and my family.</i>

590
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,800
{\an8}<i>And I started to make research.</i>

591
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,600
<i>I found out my father was deported</i>
<i>to Auschwitz in September '42.</i>

592
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,080
<i>My mother was arrested</i>
<i>in October in Brussels</i>

593
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,600
<i>and deported to Auschwitz.</i>

594
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,200
<i>I was told that they didn't come back.</i>

595
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,360
<i>So, I went by car to Auschwitz.</i>

596
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
<i>I saw the camp…</i>

597
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,440
<i>where there was not a single soul.</i>

598
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,480
<i>The chamber…</i>
<i>The gas chambers were exploded.</i>

599
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,840
<i>I found some candles,</i>
<i>what we call Jahrzeit,</i>

600
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,080
<i>still burning in the rubbles</i>
<i>of some of the gas chambers.</i>

601

<i>Before leaving,</i>

602
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,840
<i>I had a Star of David done</i>
<i>in dried flowers.</i>

603
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
<i>I just didn't know…</i>

<i>where to put it.</i>

605
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,920
<i>I couldn't put it at the monument.</i>

606
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,440
<i>So, finally, I chose the…</i>

607
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,560
<i>the little pond.</i>

608
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,080
<i>It floated there.</i>

609
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,240
<i>And I think that was the time that I…</i>

<i>My parents, my grandmother, my cousin.</i>

<i>[Jane] Evelyne is herself</i>
<i>a Holocaust survivor</i>

<i>whose story was very much like Misha's.</i>

618
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,120
<i>So she was the perfect person</i>
<i>to find what was going on.</i>

619
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
<i>[tense music playing]</i>

620
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,160
<i>[Sharon] In the French book,</i>
<i>the foster family had a surname of Valle.</i>

621
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,520
<i>And in the American book</i>
<i>the foster family's surname was de Wael.</i>

622
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,280
<i>To reconcile the name changes,</i>

623
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,480
<i>Evelyne went through the city directories</i>

624
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,760
<i>for the 1930s, 1940s.</i>

625
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,240
<i>[Evelyne] I came at least three days</i>

626
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,600
<i>searching for the de Waels and the Valles.</i>

627
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,640
<i>The name Valle was not in the phone books.</i>

628
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,000
<i>The Valle name didn't exist.</i>

629
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,840
{\an8}<i>De Wael, yes.</i>

630
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,640
{\an8}<i>There were many de Wael.</i>
<i>Many, many, many, many.</i>

631
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,560
<i>[Jane] So, now you start to think,</i>

632
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,200
<i>the French book</i>
<i>was distributed in Belgium,</i>

633
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,640
{\an8}<i>and if something about Misha's story</i>
<i>is not true,</i>

634
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,160
<i>it would be important for her not to put</i>
<i>her real name in that French book.</i>

635
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,040
<i>There would be somebody over there</i>

636
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,360
<i>who would say,</i>
<i>"I knew the de Wael family."</i>

637
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,400
<i>"I know whether or not she was around,</i>
<i>or did she disappear during the war."</i>

638
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,240
<i>[Sharon] The fact that she changed</i>
<i>the name in France and Belgium</i>

639
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,680
<i>from de Wael to Valle,</i>

640
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,600
<i>suggests to me</i>
<i>that she's trying to hide something.</i>

641
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,560
<i>[Jane] Sharon and I</i>
<i>both looked at this and said,</i>

642
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,760
<i>"Something's really wrong</i>
<i>with this story."</i>

643
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,600
<i>So, at this point, the book had been</i>
<i>taken over by a French publisher,</i>

644
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,280
<i>who had published it in 20 languages.</i>

645
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,600
<i>It was a huge bestseller all over Europe.</i>

646
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,840
<i>She was speaking to schoolchildren</i>
<i>all over the French-speaking world.</i>

<i>[Marie-Claire Mommer speaking French] </i>
<i>In 2005,</i>

<i>But it was quite clever.</i>

715
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,400
<i>There were four different booklets.</i>

716
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,400
<i>You needed all four to find the child.</i>

00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,080
<i>But all four of them</i>
<i>were in different places.</i>

718

<i>If any Nazi found a single booklet,</i>

<i>So it was starting to get</i>
<i>pretty uncomfortable,</i>

<i>to support her story,</i>

794

<i>her mother's maiden name was Donville,</i>

<i>[Evelyne] Etterbeek, a suburb of Brussels.</i>

<i>I searched for different churches.</i>

804
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,240
<i>[Jane] So Evelyne went to the first one.</i>
<i>The records weren't there.</i>

805
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,280
<i>[Evelyne] Went to another one…</i>

00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,400
<i>[Jane] No baptismal record</i>

<i>[Evelyne]</i>
<i>And to the third one in the area…</i>

00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,120
<i>[Jane] As it turns out,</i>
<i>the church had burnt to the ground.</i>

00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,280
<i>So, Evelyne was looking</i>
<i>date by date by date,</i>

817
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,800
<i>all the children born in that parish.</i>

818
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,840
<i>I knew two things:</i>

819
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,400
<i>Her date of birth, 12th of May, 1937,</i>

820
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,280
<i>and the mother's name, Donville.</i>

821
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,200
<i>[music climaxes]</i>

822
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,120
<i>And in that book, I found her.</i>

823
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,320
{\an8}<i>"Monica Ernestina Josephine de Wael…</i>

824
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:42,120
<i>daughter of</i>
<i>Roberti Henrici Ernesti de Wael</i>

825
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,400
<i>and Josephinae Germanae Barbarae Donvil."</i>

826
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,080
<i>The revelation was that</i>
<i>Misha's father's name was de Wael.</i>

827
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,080
<i>So, at that point, it seemed that</i>
<i>Monique de Wael was her real name.</i>

828
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,720
<i>It wasn't a name</i>
<i>given to her by foster parents</i>

829
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,320
<i>to hide her from the Nazis.</i>

830
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,840
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>she was born Monique de Wael.</i>

831
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,520
<i>She was a Catholic.</i>
<i>She was baptized Catholic.</i>

832
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,080
<i>Her father was de Wael.</i>

833
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,400
<i>However, it wasn't proof conclusive.</i>

834
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,080
<i>Because in those days,</i>
<i>they used to take names of dead children</i>

835
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,720
<i>and give them to Jewish children,</i>
<i>by way of hiding them.</i>

836
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,400
<i>It was possible that the de Waels</i>
<i>had taken in a hidden child</i>

837
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,680
<i>and that their own child had died.</i>

838
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,800
<i>I needed further proof.</i>

839
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,680
<i>[director] So what did you do next?</i>

840
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,800
<i>[chuckles] Off the record,</i>

<i>-[crew chuckles]</i>
<i>-[chuckling] What do I do next?</i>

842
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,880
<i>[Jane] Evelyne figured out, "All right,</i>
<i>where else can I find that proof?"</i>

843
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,760
<i>She would've gone to school.</i>

844
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:09,400
<i>I tried to find a school on the tram track</i>
<i>that she mentioned in her book.</i>

845
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,880
<i>[chuckles] And as I walked by,</i>
<i>I hit the school.</i>

846
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,720
<i>The door was open.</i>

847
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,200
<i>I walked in and asked</i>

848
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,400
<i>if they had any record of someone</i>
<i>with the name of Monique de Wael.</i>

849
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,880
<i>[Jane] So, we're biting our fingernails,</i>

{\an8}<i>Either we've got the records or we don't.</i>

853
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,640
<i>[Evelyne] And there on the register</i>
<i>was her name.</i>

<i>"De Wael, Monique."</i>

855
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,720
<i>That was really the final proof,</i>
<i>shall I say.</i>

856
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,600
<i>Both the baptism certificate</i>

857

<i>and her attendance</i>
<i>in a school in Brussels.</i>

<i>I got to the phone, and I picked up</i>
<i>the phone and it was Sharon.</i>

859
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,000
<i>And Sharon could hardly contain</i>
<i>her excitement.</i>

860
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,800
<i>She practically screamed into the phone,</i>

861
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,560
<i>"We've got the records!</i>

<i>"I would not publish this book."</i>

01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,480
<i>I have thought a lot over the years</i>

1201
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,680
<i>I think it was greed</i>
