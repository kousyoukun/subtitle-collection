end up doing Harry Potter?

48
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,414
说服我读那些书

－谢谢你，艾莉诺
- Thank you, Eleanor.
- I said... I said

52

"Okay, I'll read these finally."

I saw the movies.

「这是我的愿景」

about eight years old.

66

{\an5}那是第一集出来的时候
I think that's when the first one
came out.

67
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,834
就像融入了我们的家庭一样
It became like our family thing.

68

我爸爸模仿过所有的声音
My dad used to do all the voices

69

我和我弟变得痴迷
and my brother and I
just became obsessed.

我们求他继续念
We would just beg him to keep going.

71
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:02,678
每当他念一章，我们都会说
「再来一章，拜托？」
And every time he'd finish a chapter,
we'd be like

72
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,219
"One more! One more!
Please, just one more.

73

有前两集的书
A friend of mine at school had
the first two.

75
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,934
我去他家过夜
I went for a sleepover at his house.

76
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,562
{\an5}他说「神秘的魔法石」在书架上
He said, "Well, Philosopher's Stone's
there on the bookshelf."

77
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:14,064
我们开始彻夜读书
That's what we did
this whole sleepover.

78
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:16,692
我们静静地坐在那里
他在读「消失的密室」
We just both sat there in silence,
him reading Chamber of Secrets

79
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,360
我在读「神秘的魔法石」
me reading Philosopher's Stone.

80
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,945
我读到无法自拔
And that was it, really.
I never looked back.

81
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,282
{\an5}我在阅读的过程
瞬间和弗雷德和乔治产生共鸣
At the time of reading

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,157
we instantly related
to Fred and George

83
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,159
{\an5}因为文学作品中没有多少双胞胎
because there aren't many twins
in literature.

84
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:29,955
{\an5}「消失的密室」
是我第一本熬夜在看的书
The Chamber of Secrets
was the first book

85
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:29,914
that I sort of genuinely stayed up
at night reading.

86
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,707
文笔真生动
The writing was so vivid.

87
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,084
人物关系如此融洽
The characters so relatable.

88
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:37,213
{\an5}这是一个如此错综复杂的
It was such an intricately,
perfectly designed universe.

89
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,256
完美设计的宇宙

90
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,841
我觉得当时很容易忘记
I think it's very easy to forget
that at the time

91
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,385
{\an5}人们都在谈论阅读是无趣的
people were talking about, like,
the death of reading.

92
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,597
{\an5}我只是觉得这是美妙的人生观
I just think it's a beautiful,
creative outlook on life

93
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,474
这种对无限可能的信念
this belief
in limitless possibilities.

94
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,185
我非常欣赏
ＪＫ罗琳的众多原因之一
One of the many reasons I admire
J.K. so much

95
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,562
是数百万人正在读书
is that millions would now read books

96
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,940
或许他们这辈子
都不会拿起一本书
who would never have lifted
a book up in their lives.

97
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,943
而你突然意识到写作的力量
And you suddenly realize
the power of writing.

98
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,319
哈利
Hip, hip, Harry!

99
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:03,447
然后在选角方面，这是…
And then in terms of casting

100
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,826
it was the search for Harry Potter,
it was insane.

101
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,826
寻找哈利波特的过程很疯狂

102
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,453
新的「哈利波特」电影
正在寻找孩子
The new Harry Potter film are
looking for children

103
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:13,541
在这部价值数百万镑的电影中
饰演三个主要角色
to play the three main roles
in the multi-million pound film.

104
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,545
我记得第一次去试镜
I remember going
to the... the very first audition

105
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:21,090
有数百甚至数千人
and there were hundreds,
if not thousands of people.

106
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,425
然后我们意识到
我们是那里唯一的一对
And then we realized that we were
the only set of twins there

107
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,052
没有穿相同衣服的双胞胎
who weren't wearing
identical clothing

108
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:27,137
所以我们越过马路
so we ended up going over the road

109
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:30,474
买了两件相同的上衣
and bought two identical,
matching tops.

110
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:31,892
－直接穿上
－直接穿上
- Just off the rack.
- Just off the rack.

111
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:33,686
拿了就走
They're like, "Right, they will do."
And then off we went.

112
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,021
他们让所有人集合
They'd let us all mill, you know,
sort of congregate.

113
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,356
聚集在一起

114
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,733
{\an5}所以他们似乎走开了
So they seemingly walked away.

115
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:43,904
{\an5}还有一个男生拿着麦克风
举在我们的头上
And of course,
while there's still one gentleman

116
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:43,821
holding a boom mic
straight over our heads.

117
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,991
有个小女孩问我「那是什么？」
And this little girl asks me,
"What's that?"

118
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,578
我说「看就知道是麦克风啊」
I think I even said,
"It's a mic. Duh."

119
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:53,873
「他们正在拍摄
是在测试我们」
And I was like, "They're filming us.
This is just like a trick."

120
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,749
「我以前也有参与过」
Like, as if I've done it before,
really.

121
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,376
我记得，因为问的人就是埃玛
I remember it because it was Emma.

122
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:02,339
我彻底被这次试镜的
兴奋氛围所吸引
I became completely gripped

123
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:02,298
by the excitement
around this audition.

124
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:05,718
我的目标就是拿下妙丽的角色
I always knew
that I was going for Hermione

125
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,263
我的坚持让我父母很担心
他们想说…
in a way, that I think,
terrified my parents

126
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,263
because they were like

127
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,932
「如果她没有得到这个角色
我们该怎么办？」
"What are we gonna do with her
if she doesn't get the part?"

128
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,058
我很兴奋
I was just excited.
I wasn't sort of daunted.

129
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,477
我并没有被吓倒，没思考太多

130
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,937
I wasn't thinking, "I wonder
how many films they're gonna make."

131
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,771
我想知道他们要拍多少部电影

132
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,106
我想「这会很有趣」
Anything like that.
I thought, oh, this will be fun.

133
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:21,025
{\an5}我觉得一开始最大的压力
And I think the biggest pressure
at the beginning was

134
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,359
{\an5}是谁将成为哈利波特
who was gonna be Harry Potter.

135
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,779
我们找不到哈利
We couldn't find Harry.

136
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:25,988
We couldn't.
We just couldn't find Harry.

137
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:28,991
情况变得有点奇怪
大家也开始紧张起来
And it was getting kind of weird
and panicky.

138
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:32,912
有一天晚上
我在伦敦的酒店房间里
I was in my hotel room
in London one night

139
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,039
观看电台的「戴维高帕菲」
watching the BBC version
of David Copperfield.

140
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,999
我突然灵光一闪
Immediately, a light bulb went off
in my head and I said

141
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:38,751
「这就是哈利波特」
"This is Harry Potter.

142
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,545
「这就是我们几个月来
一直在寻找的孩子」
This is the kid we've been
looking for, for months."

143
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,422
所以我问了选角导演，我说…
So I asked the casting director
and I said

144
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,507
「我们必须让他来这里试镜」
"We've got to get him in here
for an audition."

145
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,842
她说「这根本不可能」
She said, "It's never gonna happen.

146
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,095
「他父母不想让他卷入演艺圈」
His parents do not want him
involved in this world.

147
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,597
「他们不希望他饰演这个角色」
They don't want him
to take this role."

148
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,141
合约是签所有七部电影
I think the deal was
to sign on for all seven films

149
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,726
他们将在洛杉矶拍摄
and they would be filmed in LA,
so Mom and Dad were like

150
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,854
爸妈认为「这对他的生活来说
是一个巨大的干扰」
"No, that's like a huge disruption
to his life."

151
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:04,026
幸运的是
几周后戴维海曼去了剧院
Fortunately, David Hayman went
to the theater a few weeks later.

152
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,071
排在我前面的这两个家伙转身
These two guys in the row
in front of me

153
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,029
started sort of turning round.

154
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:09,490
戴维是伟大的制作人
David being the great producer
that he is

155
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:14,453
说服丹的父亲带丹参加试镜
convinced Dan's father
to bring Dan in for an audition.

156
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:17,164
And that's basically
when we got our Harry Potter.

157
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,206
基本上就是
我们选定哈利波特的时候

158
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,666
开拍
And action.

159
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,793
－那是龙蛋
－这是什么？
That's a dragon egg.

160
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,419
－就是这样
－那是什么？
- What is it? I...
- That's what that is.
- What is that?
- A dragon egg.

161
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:23,837
一颗龙蛋

162
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:25,130
是的

163
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,256
我是一个快乐的孩子
I was a very happy kid

164
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,133
显然有一种神经质的气场
who had a really haunted quality,
apparently.

165
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,301
很可爱
"You're really sweet

166
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:33,013
但看起来像是经历过很多事
but you look like
you have real, like, stuff going on."

167
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:37,309
我们当下情绪很激动
看到这个孩子坐在那里说话
It was very emotional, actually

168
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,393
seeing this kid sitting there,
talking.

169
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:38,686
我想「是的，就是他」
And I just thought, yup, that's him.
Thank God we found him.

170
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,062
「感谢上帝，我们找到了他」

171
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:43,232
鲁伯特和埃玛很快就被选上了
Rupert and Emma
were very easy to cast

172
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,317
因为他们比预想的好
because they felt like
they jumped off the page.

173
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,152
我们一起试镜了他们三个
We screen tested
the three of them together

174
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,071
为了确保他们
都有跟彼此产生化学反应
to make sure
that they all had this chemistry

175
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,782
这在第一次试镜中就很明显了
which immediately was obvious
in the first screen test.

176
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,411
记住，当她发现讯息时靠近她
Remember guys, get closer to her
as she finds out the information.

177
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,704
开拍
And action.

178
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:00,040
我从没想过要仔细看看
I never thought to look in here.

179
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,877
我看过了
这在第一学期还算轻松的
I checked this out last term
for a bit of light reading.

180
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,255
－这算轻松？
－住口
- This is light?
- Shut up.

181
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,425
如果飞七现在就在转角处
If Filch comes round the corner
any second now

182
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,927
至少会扣葛来分多五十分
at least 50 points off Gryffindor.

183
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,641
我就知道找到了
I knew it! Here it is.

184
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:23,480
尼乐勒梅先生是
唯一已知的魔法石制造者
Nicolas Flamel is
the only known maker

185
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,647
of The Sorcerer's Stone.

186
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:24,940
什么？
- The what?
- The what?

187
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,609
你们两个不读书吗？
Oh, honestly, don't you two read?

188
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,111
停，做得好
Cut. Good job.

189
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,989
很高兴见到你
It's lovely seeing you.

190
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,699
这太不可思议了，对吧？
Yeah, this is surreal, isn't it?

191
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,869
{\an5}谈论过去的感觉如何？
How do we all feel being back
and talking about this?

192
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:40,039
首先，我真的很激动
Well, A, really emotional obviously.

193
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:43,250
其次，感觉时间没有过去
And B, it feels like
no time has passed

194
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,003
但时间已经过去很久了
and loads of time
has passed simultaneously.

195
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,838
我懂，这非常不可思议
Yeah, kind of much the same.
It's quite surreal.

196
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,174
感觉才过没多久
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

197
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,801
感觉我们还没有重新团聚
It doesn't feel like we've
kind of earned a reunion yet.

198
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,011
－是的
－我知道
- Yeah.
- I know. I know.

199
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:56,346
我患有肾结石的同时
还有个孩子
I have had kidney stones and a baby.
Some time has obviously passed.

200
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,307
－时间的确过很久了
－的确
- You did mention that.
- I feel my age.

201
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,683
我感觉老了

202
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,102
－但是有，比如…
－是的
But there is such a collection
of shared memories and stuff

203
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:05,773
回忆，例如我们共享的回忆

204
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,775
that we just all did together
that is immediately very easy to be

205
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:07,775
这很容易成为，就像…

206
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:09,443
有点回到从前的那个时候
to sort of slip back
into where you were.

207
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:12,071
我们的第一次试镜
我们见面的那天
Our first audition,
the day we all met...

208
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,947
－我第一次…
－天啊，是的
- Oh my God, yeah.
- I think for the first time

209
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,824
我走出我的更衣室
there was, like, me walking out
of my dressing room

210
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,578
看到另一个棕发男孩走向另一边
and seeing another young,
brown-haired boy going the other way.

211
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:21,622
我从未见过他
但你显然是另一个选角
I never saw his face but I was like,
"You're clearly another Harry

212
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,832
－今天正在试镜
－是的
that is being tested out today."
And they were like

213
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,710
他们正在用
各种不同的配置测试我们
testing us with various
different configurations

214
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:27,878
荣恩、哈利和妙丽
of Ron, Harry and Hermione.
I remember there was one

215
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,131
我记得有一次
他们把我们放在一起

216
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,131
where they put
all the three of us together.

217
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,009
我记得那是我们三个人
I do remember
that when it was the three of us

218
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,261
－感觉不太一样
－是的
- something felt different and...
- Right.

219
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,971
感觉一切都很合理
- Yeah.
- like, right and easy.

220
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,515
我还记得那瞬间
I do remember the click.

221
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:42,267
我们在工作室
他们说我们被选上了
We'd been at the studios.
They'd told us we got the parts.

222
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,604
他们说「我们正式宣布
你们被选上了」
And they're like, "Cool, so we're
announcing you got the parts.

223
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:48,148
「现在你们家外面
会有很多媒体」
There is now going to be
a lot of media outside your house

224
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,483
「所以你不能回家」
so you can't go home."

225
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:53,195
到目前为止，事情有点混乱了
So far, it's sort of turned things
upside down.

226
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,823
像…
It's...I don't know.

227
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:59,159
我不知道
我从来没有遇过这样的事情
I've never had anything happen
to me like this before.

228
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:02,079
妙丽和我很有共鸣
Hermione made complete sense to me.

229
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,499
那就是我，我就像是那个女孩
That's me. Like, I am that girl.

230
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:09,628
埃玛可以说是片场里最聪明的人
Well, Emma was arguably
the smartest person on the set.

231
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,839
我说的是整个片场，她…
And I'm talking about everybody.
She just was...

232
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,757
她是一个聪明的孩子
she was a brilliant kid.

233
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,968
我疯狂喜欢我的角色
I think I'm scarily like
my character.

234
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,722
我住在一个七口之家
Because I live with a family of seven.

235
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,309
我有一个红头发的妹妹
我住在洞穴屋里
And I've got a red-headed sister,
and I live in a burrow.

236
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:28,147
鲁伯特是个在镜头面前
非常淡定的１２岁男孩
Rupert is just the most camera-ready

237
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,481
12-year-old boy in the world
at that point.

238
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,606
在那个时候的世界

239
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,236
他无所畏惧
Like, he was so, like, just fearless.

240
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,072
鲁伯特就是荣恩
Rupert was Ron, you know.

241
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,658
而丹有点像哈利
And Dan kind of was Harry.

242
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:41,952
成名是什么感觉？
How do you feel
about becoming famous?

243
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,787
很酷
It'd be cool.

244
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,206
我们都在谈论这个
We were all talking about this

245
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,042
你在我们的试镜中
让我们多么自在
how comfortable you made us all
in our auditions

246
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,837
也影响了整个剧组
and how this extended massively
into the set.

247
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,673
我的记忆是
这对你来说似乎毫不费力
My memory of it is
that it seemed effortless to you.

248
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,801
在拍第一部电影的时候
我一直很战战兢兢
Well, on the first film,
I was dying the entire time.

249
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:01,597
但我相信不能带来那种焦虑
But I just... I always believed

250
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:01,597
you cannot bring
that kind of anxiety.

251
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,056
我希望每个人都感到舒适
I want everyone to feel comfortable.

252
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,267
我希望每个人
都觉得这是个大家庭
I want everyone
to feel like it's a family.

253
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,102
我希望每个人
都有宾至如归的感觉
I want everyone to feel
like they're home.

254
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,531
（霍格沃茨的第一年）

255
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,501
听我说，欢迎来到第一堂飞行课
Hey class, listen to me.
Welcome to your first finals.

256
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:34,129
我要你用手举起扫帚
I want you to raise your hand
over the broom.

257
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,089
在拍摄电影的前几周
For the first several weeks
on the film

258
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:39,801
孩子们基本上处于震惊状态
the kids are basically in shock.

259
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,222
回想起来，我有点惊讶
我从来没搞清楚状况
Looking back,
I am sort of amazed at the fact

260
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,598
that I wasn't ever, like,
completely overwhelmed by it.

261
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,057
完全不知所措

262
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,894
丹，这次你转身离开她时
转身离开
- It's two pounds.
- Dan, when you turn away

263
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:50,437
from her this time you turn away,
grab onto this

264
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,938
抓住这个，你抬头看

265
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:52,689
就像你会抓到它，好吗？
look up like you're going to get it,
okay?

266
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:55,692
但我也认为那是
克里斯和整个剧组的安排
But I also think
that was again part of Chris

267
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:55,692
and the whole crew just like

268
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,736
让我们一直玩得很开心
they kept us having fun
the whole time.

269
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,029
很明显，我们只是孩子
Obviously, we were just kids
and we were all looking forward

270
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,907
我们都期待着一起胡闹

271
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:01,907
to mucking about together.

272
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,619
克里斯哥伦布
把气氛搞得非常像在一个游乐园
Chris Columbus made the atmosphere
very much like a fun fair.

273
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:09,039
我们就像在片场上
无忧无虑的孩子
We were very much just like kids
being kids on a set.

274
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:12,125
我从一开始的记忆
My residing memory from the first...
from Philosopher's Stone is

275
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,878
从「神秘的魔法石」开始
我刚学会玩拍手游戏
I just learned how to play Slam.

276
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:16,463
我们做了很多事情
You know what we did
a lot of as well?

277
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:17,798
－那个游戏是…
－我的天啊
- Was that game. Slaps.
- Oh my God.

278
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,675
－拍手，是的
－打了这么多手
- So much hand slap.
- Oh, slaps.

279
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,762
我们所有人的手都红了
红通通的手
With, like, all of us, like, red.

280
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,220
- Like, red raw hands from like...
- Yeah. I think we also upgraded...

281
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,348
－互相打得很厉害
－还有小腿
- hitting each other really hard.
- to knuckles as well and we're like

282
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,807
- Oh, and shins.
- Yeah.

283
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,557
－是的
－对
- Yeah.
- I remember shin version.

284
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:28,809
我记得小腿的版本

285
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,102
是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,521
对不起
- Sorry.
- Making me mad.

287
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,566
我是冠军
I am the champion.

288
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,236
他们可能让自己的工作更难了
They probably made their jobs harder
for themselves

289
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,821
让我们尽可能地享受乐趣
by letting us have as much fun
as we had

290
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:44,616
因为让我们从工作中
分散了注意力
because it distracted us from,
you know

291
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,825
the work we were supposed
to be doing.

292
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,119
各位观众，我有一个捕鼠器
And you, get a mouse trap...

293
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,954
－看影片就知道
－不要放在你的鼻子上
Oh, darling, don't put it
on your nose.

294
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,706
否则你会弄掉所有的妆
Going to remove all your makeup.

295
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,043
一个大问题是
在整个拍摄过程中
Like a big problem was, like,
throughout a take

296
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,795
our attention would, like,
would wane and come and go.

297
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,878
我们的注意力会来来去去

298
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,381
他们会说一句台词
然后对着镜头微笑
They'd say a line
and then they'd smile at the camera

299
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,758
他们很高兴能出演
「哈利波特」电影
or they were just so happy
to be in a Harry Potter film

300
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,177
无法长时间抑制他们的兴奋
that they couldn't contain
their excitement long enough

301
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:06,096
专注于整个片场
to focus on an entire scene.

302
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,931
大伙们
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

303
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,851
哥伦布很常和孩子们一起工作
Columbus had worked with kids a lot.

304
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:13,353
他对他们非常好，真的很好
He was terrific with them,
he really was.

305
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,856
他常常跪下跟他们说话
He used to go down
on his knees to talk to them

306
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:17,774
挤成一团，没人能听到
and huddle around
so nobody could hear.

307
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:21,570
他就像父亲一样
你真的可以感觉到
He was such a dad as well.

308
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,655
Like, you could really feel that
we were kind of part of his family.

309
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,655
就像我们是他家庭的一部分

310
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,407
放松一点
Be a little looser with this.

311
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,117
然后就随便聊了
- Don't just be talking.
- All right, reset to one.

312
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,368
－好的
－你知道我在说什么吗？
You know what I'm saying?
Walk and you're like frozen like this

313
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:29,953
－是的
－你就像这样冻住

314
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:31,288
－但你可以…
－不
but you can be...

315
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,581
你真的觉得…
Do you really think...
of course he can use it.

316
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:35,208
你当然可以挥一下，好吗？

317
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,500
- Okay?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,626
好的，不过做得好
Good job though.

319
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,920
这并不容易
因为这需要极大的耐心
But it's not easy because it takes
a tremendous amount of patience...

320
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,547
和孩子相处的时候
with kids, particularly with...

321
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,760
特别是和像我们一样
好动又兴奋的孩子

322
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,300
with kids as hyperactive

323
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:44,760
and as excited about it
as we all were.

324
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,179
（古灵阁巫师银行）
Yes.

325
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:49,264
{\an5}－看起来很优雅
－他们想…
- Looking graceful and poised...
- Well, they wanted to read...

326
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,807
你们在这啊
Fancy seeing you boys here.

327
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,726
－你好
－来吧
Hey.

328
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,519
几个葛来分多的家伙
Snuck away. Couple of Gryffindor's
just kicking it.

329
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,229
－过来
－很高兴见到你，兄弟
Look at you. Come here.
Good to see you, brother.

330
00:15:57,773 --> 00:16:00,901
克里斯哥伦布是如何保持
良好的精神状态的？
How did Chris Columbus stay
in such good... good spirit?

331
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,986
我们跑来跑去的
但我们那时都是１１岁
We sort of ran around.
But I guess we were all, like, 11.

332
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,405
你可能会让三个人做正确的事情
You might get, like, three people
to do the right thing.

333
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,074
但这并不意味着
你会在后台让其他五位
But it doesn't mean you're gonna get
the other five in the background

334
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,200
－做正确的事
－不
- No. No.
- doing the right thing.

335
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,243
鲁伯特很无情，一旦他开始…
And Rupert was relentless.

336
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,953
－一旦闸门打开
－天啊，是的
Once he started,
once the floodgate opened with him.

337
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,872
就是这样才有用，不是吗？
But just think that was...
That's why it worked wasn't it?

338
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,500
因为哥伦布基本上只是让我们…
Because Columbus basically
just let us be...

339
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,709
－是啊，没错
－当孩子
- Yeah, true. True.
- kids.

340
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,378
我从不觉得我们是在工作
I never recalled feeling
like we're working.

341
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,046
这很重要，不是吗？
But that's so important, is it?
That we had that.

342
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,173
这就是为什么当你看电影时
会有这种感觉…
Yeah. That's why it feels
that way when you watch it.

343
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,925
－感觉就像一群孩子
－没错
- It feels like kids.
- Yeah. That's true.

344
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,718
我会告诉你，有趣的点是…
I tell you what's funny about that
though is being surrounded

345
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:32,474
被所有英国演艺圈的菁英包围
by all the cream
of the British acting industry

346
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,766
and not having a clue who anyone is.

347
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,935
－对
－我以为理查德哈里斯在那工作
I thought Richard Harris worked here
for... as a tour guide for a while.

348
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:37,896
做了一段时间的导游

349
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:44,319
我不认为任何一个孩子有能力
I don't think any of the kids had
the capability of understanding

350
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,280
了解他们当时
正在打交道的人有多厉害
the gravity of who they were
dealing with at the time.

351
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,741
海格在村子里
遇到的人不是陌生人
That was no stranger Hagrid met in
the village, it was Snape.

352
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:53,703
是石内卜教授
他知道如何瞒过毛毛

353
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:53,745
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

354
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,247
而且这时邓不利多不在
- And with Dumbledore gone?
- Good afternoon.

355
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,456
午安

356
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,583
演艺圈的英国皇室
The British royalty
of the acting world.

357
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:00,877
你要对自己说什么？
What have you got to say
for yourself?

358
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,587
我发誓我不知道是怎么发生的
I swear, I don't know
how it happened.

359
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,799
当遇到我成长过程中
听说过的演员
When I think of the people that I got
to just grow up around and hear

360
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:08,760
听他们讲话，跟他们互动
yeah, hear them interact
and hear the quickness of people.

361
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,804
并听到他们的反应

362
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,432
大人演员进来了
The adult actors came in and were
like, the mischief in a funny way.

363
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,308
感觉很有趣，像在偷听一样

364
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,187
很棒
That's actually great.

365
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,689
比如，罗比寇特兰
Like Robbie Coltrane.

366
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:23,900
他像个孩子，太不成熟了
He was such a kid, like, so immature
and, like, just so much fun.

367
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:27,237
而且太有趣了

368
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,449
他喜欢逗我们发笑
他真的很擅长
He loved making us laugh,
and he was incredibly good at it.

369
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,784
我几乎尝试了一遍
I've tried absolutely everything.

370
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:36,788
我试过面霜、我试过胶冻
我试过刮胡子
I've tried creams,
I've tried jellies.

371
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:36,788
I tried shaving.

372
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:41,042
我醒来的每一刻
我丈夫都威胁要离开我
Every moment, I woke up it's like my
husband is threatening to leave me.

373
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,629
如果他真的爱我
我敢肯定他不会介意留一点胡须
If he really loved me, he wouldn't
mind a little facial hair I'm sure.

374
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:47,215
但他非常难接受
But he's being very, very difficult.

375
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,385
{\an5}（不到黎明绝不停止
霍格沃茨魔法与巫术学院）

376
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,680
{\an5}就像你的善良和温暖
That, like, kindness
and that warmth from you...

377
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:55,182
使一切变得不同
it made all the difference.

378
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,601
我们在一起渡过了很多时光
Well, we spent so much time together.

379
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:00,312
我知道我和你在一起的时间
多过和我自己的孩子
- I know. I know.
- I mean...
I spent more time with you
than I did with my own children

380
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,230
我知道，很疯狂
- at one point.
- I know. Wild.

381
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,523
我知道
- I know.
- I think most of my favorite scenes

382
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,650
我最喜欢的大多数场景，老实说

383
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:08,945
是与你和海格小屋里的
那帮人在一起
if I'm honest, looking back, are with
you and the gang in Hagrid's hut.

384
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,990
当我被称为麻瓜时
我一直在想那个场景
I keep thinking about that scene
where I get called a Mudblood.

385
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,701
－是的
－那天你对我真好
- Yes.
- And you were so sweet with me

386
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,661
－是的
－因为这就像我的第一次一样
- that day.
- Yes.
Because it was, like, my first, like,
you know, big piece of acting.

387
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,371
大量的演技

388
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,336
他叫我麻瓜
He called me a Mudblood.

389
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:26,796
不会吧
He did not.

390
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,131
什么是麻瓜？
What's a Mudblood?

391
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,300
意思是「脏血」
It means dirty blood.

392
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:33,178
对于一个麻瓜出身的人来说
麻瓜是个臭名昭彰的名字
Mudblood's a really foul name
for someone who is Muggle born

393
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:34,888
一个没有巫师父母的人
someone with no magic parents,
someone like me.

394
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,515
跟我一样的人

395
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,517
你们三个都成为如此出色的演员
The three of you have become
such great actors.

396
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,270
在那个片场
像是你进入了这个世界
Being on that set, you felt like
you actually entered the world.

397
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,773
有斯图尔特克雷格
设计的所有场景
- Yeah. Yeah.
- With all of Stuart Craig sets-

398
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,441
他对细节的注意力很惊人
the attention to detail
was phenomenal.

399
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,446
（创造不可能）

400
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,367
我一直认为在霍格沃茨
不应该感到…
I was always adamant that Hogwarts
shouldn't feel as if it's a world

401
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,912
彷佛这是一个现实中
不可能存在的世界

402
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,912
that couldn't exist in reality.

403
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,748
我有极大的创作自由
I had a tremendous amount
of creative freedom

404
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,543
我们可以从头建造这个世界
so we could build this world
from the ground up.

405
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,337
电影里的一些场景让我不知所措
Some of the sets on Potter
were overwhelming to me

406
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,006
我演了３５年的戏，想说「天啊」
and I'd been doing it for 35 years
you know.

407
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,006
It's like, oh, blimey.

408
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,134
我第一次参观片场时
The very first time
I visited the set

409
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,055
他们带我穿过令人兴奋的大厅
they walked me
through the Great Hall

410
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:17,013
which was mind-blowing.

411
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,725
所有的地板都是真正的约克石
All the floors are real York stone.

412
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,852
很多场景会出现２５０个人
A lot of those scenes
with 250 extras

413
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:24,729
不是在吃东西
就是到处晃来晃去
they're all about eating
and trampling around.

414
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,481
不能用塑料餐盘
You're not gonna
put a plastic floor down.

415
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,191
必须是更符合那个背景的东西
It's gotta be the real stuff.

416
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,777
这些点燃的蜡烛
都在电线上下移动
And all these lit candles going up
and down in wires.

417
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,155
我最喜欢的片场之一
是所有漂浮蜡烛
One of my favorite moments
on set ever

418
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,114
was the moment
when all the floating candles

419
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,491
绑在天花板上的绳子开始燃烧
started burning through the ropes
that tied them to the ceiling

420
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,909
开始在餐厅周围坠落
- and just started falling around
- Yeah.

421
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,786
数以百计的蜡烛
- the Great Hall.
- Hundreds of real candles

422
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,955
－真的很亮
－我的天啊
- Oh, man, yeah.
- that were really lit

423
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,666
在天花板上的钓鱼在线
- on fishing line from the ceiling.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,501
现在很多都是靠后制
So much of that would be visual
effects now.

425
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,296
－但那时都是真的
－对，这太酷了
The fact that we got to actually be
- on that set, yeah.
- Actually, that's so true

426
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,089
－谢谢你，斯图尔特
－是的
- It's so cool.
- Thank you, Stuart Craig.

427
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,966
－我们爱你，斯图尔特克雷格
－是的
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We love you, Stuart Craig.

428
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:53,550
Yeah.

429
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,145
最难拍摄的场景是魁地奇比赛
The hardest scene to shoot
was Quidditch.

430
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,772
观众必须立即了解规则
And the audience had to understand
the rules immediately.

431
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:10,567
魁地奇比赛很容易理解
Quidditch is easy enough
to understand.

432
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,110
每支球队有七名球员
Each team has seven players.

433
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,195
三名追球手，两名击球手
Three chasers, two beaters,
one keeper and the seeker.

434
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,947
一名守门员和一名找球手

435
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,157
那是你
That's you.

436
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,453
ＪＫ罗琳为我们做了
一本魁地奇比赛规则书
So Jo Rowling basically
did a rule book for us.

437
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:23,788
A Quidditch rule book,
explaining every detail of the game.

438
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,747
解释游戏的每一个细节

439
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,956
（魁地奇球场）

440
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,833
与我们的制作设计师
斯图尔特克雷格一起
Then with Stuart Craig,
our production designer

441
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,044
设计了魁地奇球场的外观
designed the look
of the Quidditch pitch

442
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:36,926
为一场完全不真实的比赛
打造了以假乱真的基调
and really create a pitch that felt
authentic and real for a game

443
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,968
that is completely unreal.

444
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:41,306
充满活力和热情，准备开始
Lots of energy and enthusiasm.

445
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,014
Set and action.

446
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:42,432
她进球了
She scores.

447
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:46,227
莉娜琼森得分，葛来分多得十分
Angelina Dancer scores.

448
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,227
Ten points for Gryffindor.

449
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,647
我一直想告诉你这件事
但有那么一刻
I always wanted to tell you this

450
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,315
but there was a moment on day two,
maybe or three

451
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,523
在第二天，或第三天

452
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:52,859
摄影机对着你，你说…
the camera pushes into you
and you say

453
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,611
「我不要回家，不是回真的家」
"Mm, we're not going home,
not really."

454
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:56,237
火车开走了
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

455
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,031
不是吗？

456
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:01,284
我不要回家，不是回真的家
I'm not going home, not really.

457
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,454
想到这里我还是会热泪盈眶
I got tear, I still get tears
in my eyes thinking about it.

458
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:08,291
我心里想「这个孩子
是个了不起的演员」
I thought, this guy,
this kid is an amazing actor.

459
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,627
－谢谢
－那一刻
- Oh, that's...
- And it was that moment

460
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,879
为我们打开了整个世界
that kind of opened up
the whole world for us.

461
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:15,840
第一部电影像童话故事
非常吸引人
And the first film
was very storybook.

462
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,925
- It's very inviting, it's like...
- Yes. It's lovely and...

463
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,967
－是的，很可爱
－欢迎来到霍格沃茨

464
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,093
- welcome to Hogwarts.
- welcome to Hogwarts.

465
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,637
－直到你看到电影的结尾
－我融化了一个男人的脸
Yeah. Until you get
to the end of the movie.

466
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,721
- And I melt a man's face.
- Yes. Yeah, exactly, Yeah.

467
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,347
对，就是这样

468
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,688
－第一部电影很受欢迎
－是的
- The first film was a hit.
- Yup.

469
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:33,274
变成爆红电影后
人们不仅接受了这部电影
So once it became a hit

470
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,066
and people accepted
not only the film

471
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,818
－也接受了演员
－是的
- but accepted the cast...
- Right, yeah.

472
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,695
－我在第二部电影像吃了定心丸
－对
- I had a ball on the second film.
- Oh, cool.

473
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,072
「消失的密室」
因为我可以拍得更无拘无束
The Chamber of Secrets.
Because I was like, free.

474
00:21:54,671 --> 00:22:00,135
（韦斯利家庭价值观）

475
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,931
来吧
Go, come on.

476
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:07,392
来吧
Okay, come on.

477
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:10,270
Shh, come on.

478
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,233
－早安，韦斯利一家
－早安，爸爸
Morning, Weasley's.

479
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:15,275
Morning, Dad.

480
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:19,487
我总是喜欢韦斯利一家
在一起的任何场景
I always loved any scene where the
kind of Weasley's were all together

481
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,697
就像洞穴屋的场景
like the burrow scenes.

482
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,616
{\an5}有股狂热的能量
每个人都互相捉弄对方
It just had this frenetic energy.

483
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,783
Everyone kind of played off
each other.

484
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,868
{\an5}（韦斯利洞穴屋）

485
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:28,121
{\an5}我记得关于洞穴屋的事情
是它一直在改变
The thing about the burrows
I remember

486
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,996
is that it changed all the time.

487
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:30,165
{\an5}不断膨胀和收缩
It sort of expanded and contracted.

488
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,334
一分钟前有一个
铺着磁砖的巨大的壁炉
One minute, there was a huge
fireplace with floor pattern.

489
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,212
然后它变小了
And then it was just...

490
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,337
- And then it got smaller.
- A little one.

491
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,965
就像一个活生生的呼吸装置
不时会改变
Yeah, it was like a living,
breathing set. It changed.

492
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,801
我觉得饰演韦斯利一家
是「哈利波特」中最棒的部分
I feel like being a Weasley is the
best part of being in Harry Potter.

493
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:44,804
就像我们的霍格沃茨一家
真的太特别了
We had, like, our Hogwarts family

494
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,056
but I felt, like, so special having
an actual extra family.

495
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,766
－有另外一个家庭
－太棒了

496
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,018
这是最棒的一件事
- It was great.
- And all these scenes that we got
- on top of everything else.
- Julie's brilliant to work with.

497
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:51,686
与茱莉共事非常棒

498
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,981
每当我们到达片场
到处会传来「爸爸妈妈好」
We used to arrive on set,
"Hello, Mummy."

499
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,064
"Hello, Daddy."

500
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:57,609
饰演我母亲
韦斯利夫人的茱莉沃特斯
Julie Walters, who played my mother,
Mrs. Weasley, was...

501
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,487
对我来说真是太棒了
Was just so wonderful
and brilliant to me.

502
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,363
她真的很照顾我
She really kind of took me under
her wing.

503
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,116
她拥有完美的妈妈形象
And she just was, like,
the perfect mother figure.

504
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,535
这对双胞胎是我
非常亲近的两个人
The twins were two people
I was really close with.

505
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,996
他们真的像哥哥一样
They really were like older brothers.

506
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,124
茱莉沃特斯和马克威廉姆斯
他们就像我的第二个家庭
Julie Walters and Mark Williams,
they were like my second family.

507
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,001
他们总是很入戏
They were always kind of
staying in character

508
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:18,129
他们会互相试探
and they would have this kind of...

509
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,213
they would bounce off each other.

510
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,298
邓不利多…
- Dumbledore... Dore...
- Who? Who, dear?

511
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:22,258
谁？亲爱的？

512
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,469
邓不利多一定知道
你在这里，哈利
Dumbledore must know
you're here, Harry.

513
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,805
停
Cut.

514
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:29,808
停，这样不行
Stop, stop.

515
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,433
This isn't working.

516
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,811
不敢相信，你们看起来很棒
I can't believe it.

517
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:33,978
你好吗？
- You guys look great.
- Hello, hello.
How are you? This is amazing.

518
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:35,688
太了不起了，你们最近还好吗？
- How you guys doing?
- Very well, thank you.

519
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,440
－很好，谢谢你好吗？
－好的
- Fantastic. How are you?
- Good.

520
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:40,068
太令人兴奋了
自从阿兹卡班之后我第一次回来
- Yeah, mate. We're good.
- This is so exciting.
- Yeah.
- It's very exciting.

521
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,569
我们不知道你会回来
This is the first time
I've been back since Azkaban.
We didn't know you
were gonna come back.

522
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:48,451
韦斯利家族的价值观
和蔼、体贴和有趣
The Weasley family values.

523
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:48,827
What consideration,
thoughtfulness, and fun.

524
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,205
哈利，你一定对麻瓜了如指掌
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

525
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:56,125
橡皮鸭的作用究竟是什么？
Tell me, what exactly is the function
of a rubber duck?

526
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,670
我们在一起的时候很自然
It's just very natural
when we were all together.

527
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:01,923
这是一个家庭
你知道的，除了名字之外
It was a family, you know.

528
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:01,548
In all but name.

529
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,634
这也是很酷的事情
就是你看到了那种情绪
The best, cool thing about it as well
is that you see

530
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,594
that motion where they are
very inclusive.

531
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,594
他们非常包容

532
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,889
你会看到马份家完全相反的情况
And then you see the complete
opposite with the Malfoy's.

533
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,308
两个家庭的比较总是很精彩
Yeah. It's always such a
good comparison, the two families.

534
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,227
完全不同
- Well, you've got like a...
- Side by side, yeah.
a real chalk and cheese side of it.

535
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:17,647
跩哥，要有礼貌
Now, now, Jacob, play nicely.

536
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:20,483
波特先生
Mr. Potter.

537
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,986
（认识马份家）

538
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,529
我是鲁休思马份
Lucius Malfoy.

539
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,322
我们终于见面了
We meet at last.

540
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,740
{\an5}我第一次知道哈利波特
I was first aware of Harry Potter

541
00:24:27,824 --> 00:24:30,869
{\an5}因为无论我走到哪里
每个人都在地铁上看书
because everybody was reading the
books on the tube.

542
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,286
Everywhere I went.

543
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,622
我一开始不想演鲁休思
但后来被说服了
I'm convinced I ended up playing
Lucius because I didn't want to.

544
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,666
我去参加基德罗洛哈的试镜
I went to audition
for Gildery Lockhart

545
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:38,084
克里斯说「太好了」
and Chris said, "That was great.

546
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,627
「你介意演看看
不同的角色吗？」
Would you mind reading
a different part?"

547
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,171
我当时在「彼得潘」中
饰演胡克船长
I was about to play Captain Hook
in Peter Pan and I thought

548
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:44,507
我不想演两个孩子的反派
well I don't want to play
two children's villains.

549
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:48,553
我咬牙切齿地读着，我深感辛酸
And I read through gritted teeth.

550
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:48,553
I was deeply bitter.

551
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:51,139
当然，这正是必要的
And, of course,
that's exactly what was necessary

552
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:54,309
最后他们让我演鲁休思
感谢上帝他们这么做
and they asked me to play Lucius.

553
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,267
And thank God they did.

554
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:56,477
你怎么敢？
How dare you?

555
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,813
对我来说，他出现在故事中
The point of him
being in the story to me

556
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,691
是为了解释为什么马份在学校
was to explain why Draco
was such a horrible, heartless

557
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:04,527
是一个如此可怕又无情
有虐待倾向的恶霸
sadistic bully at school.

558
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,655
一头红头发和穿着旧衣服
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?

559
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,782
你一定是韦斯利家的
You must be a Weasley.

560
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,492
是马份父母的产物
He's a product of his parents, Draco.

561
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,413
他有非常糟糕的父母
And he's got really bad parents.

562
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,206
如果海格是第一个影响你的人
If Hagrid was your first influence,
chances are you're gonna be

563
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,502
你很有可能会成为可爱温暖的人

564
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,417
"All right there, mate."

565
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,502
You're gonna be lovely very huggy.

566
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,254
是不是很漂亮？
Isn't he beautiful?

567
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,673
看，牠认识牠的妈妈
Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

568
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:34,724
如果你爸爸是一个挥舞着
眼镜蛇手杖的神经病
If your dad is a psychopath wielding
a cobra cane out bout

569
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:37,435
你可能不会成为最友善的人
you're probably not gonna be
the friendliest either.

570
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,562
第３５幕，第７场，相机标记
Speed. 37th take, one eight,
camera mark.

571
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:42,565
汤姆，记住，放慢下来
- Tom, remember...
- And stay on slate.

572
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,485
Slow, telling a tale
but very sinister. Soft.

573
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,693
表现出邪恶又温柔的一面

574
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,403
准备，开始
Set and action.

575
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,489
我从第一次见到汤姆就很喜欢他
I adored Tom
from the second I met him.

576
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:52,450
他永远都那么贴心
But he was always
just the biggest sweetheart.

577
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,953
与杰森一起工作真是一种享受
Working with Jason was a real treat.

578
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:58,957
事实上，与杰森一起工作
并不总是一种享受
In fact, working with Jason
was not always a treat.

579
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,463
他立刻变成我见过的
最不友善、最可怕的人
He just immediately turned
into the most unfriendly

580
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,380
horrible person I've ever met.

581
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,256
我只记得抓住他
I just remember grabbing him and,
and just being as unpleasant

582
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,260
尽我所能，不愉快地
看着他的小脸

583
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:11,260
as I possibly could
and watching his little face

584
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:13,096
不断寻求我的认可
constantly seeking my approval.

585
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,974
我拍摄的第一个场景
实际上被剪掉了
The very first scene that I shot
was actually cut

586
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,392
这是在删除的场景中
and it's on the deleted scenes.

587
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,518
马份摸了某个东西
Draco touched something
and I used this cane and I went...

588
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:19,936
我手上有手杖，然后我…

589
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,314
不要碰任何东西，马份
Don't touch anything, Draco.

590
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:25,400
但我不知道牙齿有多锋利
But I didn't know
how sharp the teeth were

591
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,860
插到小汤姆的手
and they went right
into little Tom's hands.

592
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:30,905
他抬头看着我，眼里噙满泪水
And he looked up at me
and his eyes welled with tears.

593
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,240
是的，父亲
Yes, father.

594
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,700
我说「汤姆，我很抱歉」
And I went, "Tom, I'm so sorry.

595
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:36,202
我没有意识到有多锋利
I didn't realize how sharp they were
and how heavy it was."

596
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:38,913
他说「我知道，没关系
很适合这一场戏」
And he went, "No, no, it's all right.
It was good for the scene."

597
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,498
他会是这个邪恶的父亲
He'd be this evil father,
and then they say cut

598
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:42,417
当他们说「停」

599
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,586
他过来抱抱我说
「我打得太狠了吗？」
and he'll come and give you a cuddle
and say

600
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,461
"Oh, did I, did I hit you too hard?
Did I hit you too hard?"

601
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,089
就像化身博士
He's a real, you know,
Jekyll and Hyde, that one.

602
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:52,719
Yeah.

603
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,928
Yeah.

604
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:56,556
Yeah.

605
00:26:56,723 --> 00:27:00,852
哈利波特，真是我的殊荣
Harry Potter, such an honor, it is.

606
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:04,272
我记得对一个朋友说
我有去配音
I remember saying to a friend,
you know, "I've got this part.

607
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:06,232
「哈利波特」里的精灵
It's an elf in the Harry Potter."

608
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:12,238
欢乐的尖叫声和彻底的绝望
And the squeals of joy
and the complete despair

609
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:14,073
我有多困惑
at my not understanding th...

610
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,868
这个角色有多重要
you know, how important
this character was.

611
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,874
我们拍摄时，他说「谢谢你」
We did a take, and he goes,
"Thank you, Lucius ."

612
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:24,500
下一秒我就踢倒他
And I swung my leg out
and I stepped down

613
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:26,919
我走下台阶，挥舞着我的手杖
and I, and I swung my stick
and Chris goes, "Cut.

614
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:30,006
克里斯说「停，能把杰森
滑倒的地板打扫干净吗？」
Can we clean the floor
where Jason slipped, please?"

615
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,591
我说「我没有滑倒」
And I said, "No, I didn't slip."
He said, "Well, what happened?"

616
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:33,134
他说「怎么了？」

617
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,553
我说「我把多比踢下楼梯」
And I said, "I kicked Dobby
down the stairs."

618
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,772
我觉得这会非常有趣
And I just thought, this is gonna be
ridiculously good fun.

619
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,942
马份先生…
Mr. Malfoy?

620
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:50,234
Mr. Malfoy?

621
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:53,029
这里有你的东西
I have something of yours.

622
00:27:55,114 --> 00:27:57,784
袜子很可悲，对吧？
在某一个层面上来说
The sock is pathetic, isn't it,
on one level

623
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,952
但在另一个层面上，这就是一切
but on another level,
it's everything.

624
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:03,206
我认为这就是
这个角色的美妙之处
And that's, I think,
the beauty of the character.

625
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:06,417
主人给了多比一只袜子
Master has given Dobby a sock.

626
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,002
什么？我没给
What? I didn't g...

627
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:12,632
主人送给多比衣物
Master has presented
Dobby with clothes.

628
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:15,593
多比自由了
Dobby is free.

629
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:20,264
这部电影的主题之一
就是愿意忍辱负重的朋友
One of the major themes is this
alliance of friends who endure.

630
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:37,615
那是我们最开心的一次
So you and I had one
of our greatest laughs together

631
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:39,242
－与理查德哈里斯
－是的
- Yes.
- with Richard Harris.

632
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:43,454
我们有一个动画版的凤凰佛客使
And we had a animatronic version

633
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,412
- of the Fawkes the phoenix.
- Yeah.

634
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,748
一只不存在的红色大鸟
And it was this bird, a big,
red bird that doesn't exist in life.

635
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:46,999
牠不存在
- That does not exist.
- It's not...

636
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,669
也并非不是真的
的确可能是真的
It wasn't unrealistic,
and like, it could, I guess.

637
00:28:49,752 --> 00:28:53,965
理查德进来看着凤凰说
Richard came in
and looked at the phoenix

638
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:57,009
and said, "Wow, they train these
animals marvelously these days."

639
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:57,051
他们训练这些动物真是太棒了

640
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,761
牠眼睛里有一个摄影镜头
Because they had a camera
inside the eyes.

641
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:00,596
可以看到理查德在看牠
So they could see Richard
looking at it.

642
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,517
然后他们就想说
「我们不想把话说破」
And then they were like,
"Well, we don't wanna break the spell

643
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,269
「我们就让鸟儿
继续做出反应和移动」
so we'll just keep the bird
reacting and moving."

644
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,354
之后就一直这样下去了
And then that, of course,
you know, got into a cycle

645
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,356
理查德还以为这只鸟在响应他
where Richard was like,
"The bird is responding to me."

646
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:14,485
迷人的生物，凤凰
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

647
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:17,905
牠们可以承载非常重的重量
They can carry immensely
heavy loads

648
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,492
牠们的眼泪有治愈的力量
through their, their tears
and healing powers.

649
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,494
－我们没有告诉过他
－没错
- We never told him.
- No, we never told him.

650
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:24,871
他认为这是一只真正的鸟
- No. Yeah.
- He just thought it was a real bird.

651
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,956
我们参与其中，真是太疯狂了
It was insane
that we were part of that.

652
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,084
我不知道有谁可以像你这样
开始拍这系列的电影
You know, I do not know
of another human being

653
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,084
that could've started the series
in the way you did.

654
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,504
这让我感觉很棒
我一直对离开感到内疚
Well, that makes me feel great.

655
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:34,213
I have always felt guilty
about leaving, I really did.

656
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:34,672
但我还是离开了

657
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,008
当我和你们说再见时…
- Don't.
- When I said goodbye to you guys

658
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:39,510
I was like, I can't believe
I'm leaving these guys.

659
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,468
我不敢相信我要离开你们

660
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:44,182
我认为你得到的殊荣永远不够
And I think you honestly

661
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:42,054
I don't think you ever get
enough credit

662
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:45,850
for, like, what you achieved on
those first two and with all of us.

663
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,933
对前两集和我们所有人来说都是

664
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,101
非常感谢你
And so thank you so much for that.

665
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,353
这是我一生中最伟大的经历
It's been the greatest experience
of my life.

666
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,154
你没有意识到
一个人的出身并不重要
You fail to recognize that it matters
not what someone is born...

667
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:01,699
而是他们成长成什么样子
but what they grow to be.

668
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:08,247
（第二章，成年）

669
00:30:08,331 --> 00:30:10,166
（哈利波特：阿兹卡班的逃犯）

670
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,792
（哈利波特：火杯的考验）

671
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,127
你好
Hello.

672
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,253
（天狼星布莱克）

673
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:16,631
{\an5}（药水教室
霍格沃茨魔法学校）
- Oh, how are you?
- Oh, good. Oh, thank you for coming.

674
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,007
{\an5}你好吗？

675
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,219
{\an5}谢谢你来，谢谢接受访谈

676
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,219
Thanks for chatting.

677
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:25,306
那是谁？那个人
Who is that, that man?

678
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,059
那是谁？
Who is that?

679
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,103
那是天狼星布莱克
That is Sirius Black, that is.

680
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:35,441
天狼星布莱克
是哈利不可或缺的角色
Sirius Black is an essential
character for Harry.

681
00:30:35,524 --> 00:30:38,569
{\an5}这是ＪＫ罗琳的主题
不要以貌取人
It's part of Jo's themes
of don't judge a book by its cover.

682
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,613
{\an5}天狼星布莱克作为罪犯的形象
You know, the image of Sirius Black
as a criminal

683
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,740
{\an5}是呈现给哈利的
is one that's presented to Harry.

684
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:44,617
我们有一个逍遥法外的杀手
We have a killer on the loose.

685
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,285
你是说天狼星布莱克？
Sirius Black, you mean?

686
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,788
他跟我有什么关系？
But what's he got to do with me?

687
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:53,042
然而，当哈利遇到他
并在第三部电影的过程中
And yet, when Harry meets him

688
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:52,917
and through the course
of the third film

689
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:56,671
他开始了解到
他不是别人告诉他的那个人
he comes to learn that he's not
who he is being told he was.

690
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,589
他是一个非常不同的人
He's somebody very different.

691
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:01,467
盖瑞是一位如此出色的演员
And Gary is such a remarkable actor.

692
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:06,180
我们选择他的原因之一
是他有黑暗的潜质
One of the reasons we chose him

693
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,846
is he obviously has the potential
for darkness

694
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:11,769
但他同时有个温暖的灵魂
but he has such soul
and has such a warmth within.

695
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:15,731
请问你是什么时候
知道天狼星的？
Can I ask you when were
you first approached to be Sirius?

696
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:18,192
我知道「哈利波特」
I was aware of Harry Potter

697
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:21,028
but it was very much a sort of
kids thing.

698
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,112
这对我来说就是儿童读物

699
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:24,156
人们告诉我要去看这系列的书
而且我有孩子
People were telling me
to read the books

700
00:31:22,905 --> 00:31:27,326
and I had kids, so it was gonna be
in my universe somewhere.

701
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,410
所以总是会在我人生中出现

702
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:31,289
然后他们采取了一种
稍微阴暗的方法
And then they would take in
a slightly darker approach

703
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,707
这本书很有趣
- and the book was interesting.
- Yeah.

704
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,166
我遇到了艾方索
I met Alfonso, and I think at the
time, he was my attraction.

705
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,836
我认为当时他是主要的吸引力

706
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,797
记住，你必须照顾好你的青蛙
Remember guys,
that you have to carry your frogs.

707
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,923
别担心

708
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:44,510
在「阿兹卡班的逃犯」这一集
孩子们逐渐转大人
For Azkaban, it's a coming of age.

709
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:50,182
他们正在跨越
童年和青少年时期之间的门坎
They are passing the threshold
between childhood

710
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,224
and their teenage years.

711
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:54,145
{\an5}在前两集中，哈利还是个孩子
In the first two,
Harry is still a child.

712
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:59,859
整部电影的基调偏向乐观
There is a greater optimism
around the tone itself.

713
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:02,945
然而，当他年满１３岁时
Nevertheless, when he turns 13.

714
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:07,241
哈利周围的一切
彷佛朦上了一层阴影
There is a big cloud that overshadows
everything around Harry.

715
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,953
我们还需要在风格上传达这一点
And we needed to convey
that also stylistically.

716
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,213
这是怎么回事？
What's going on?

717
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:24,467
我不知道，也许我们被袭击了
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

718
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:36,896
「阿兹卡班的逃犯」
感觉就像一个全新的时代
Prisoner of Azkaban felt like
a whole new era, really.

719
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,067
{\an5}这是一个更黑暗的故事
It was a much darker kind of story.

720
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,861
{\an5}里面有很多非常成人向的主题
There was a lot of kind of
quite adult themes in it.

721
00:32:43,944 --> 00:32:49,200
ＪＫ罗琳对催狂魔的描述非常可怕
The descriptions that J.K. Rowling
has of the dementors are very scary.

722
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,453
我真的很想传达这种感觉
And I really wanted to convey
this sense that the dementors

723
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:57,625
催狂魔所做的
就是把所有的快乐都吸走

724
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:57,583
what they do is,
they suck all the joy away.

725
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:02,046
他们正在吸取哈利的精华
That they were sucking
an essence of Harry.

726
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,132
但我认为要实现这一目标
But I think that the most
important piece to achieve

727
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,885
最重要的部分是丹的表现
that was Dan's performance.

728
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,723
拍摄「阿兹卡班的逃犯」时
你几岁？
When was Azkaban...
How old were you?

729
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,392
１４
14.

730
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,352
－我们第一次见面的时候？
－是的
- Really? When we first met?
- Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:33:16,435 --> 00:33:20,356
我有一种天生的父爱
I think I had a natural sort of
paternal thing.

732
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:28,864
你要杀了我吗，哈利？
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

733
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,243
第一个一进来片场
就让我敬畏三分的人
The first person I remember being,
like, I awe of when they came in

734
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,036
－是盖瑞欧德曼
－我记得
- was Gary, was Gary Oldman.
- I remember that.

735
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,956
－你记得我吓坏了吗？
－我记得你说跟盖瑞聊天的事
- Because that was...
- I remember you giving me the...

736
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,039
- Yeah, yeah, me freaking out? Right.
- the, the Gary chat. Yeah.

737
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,500
你说「听着，埃玛
你需要保持冷静」
You were like, "Listen, Emma,
you need to be cool

738
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,961
「因为盖瑞欧德曼
他真的是个大人物」
because Gary Oldman
is a really big deal

739
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:43,295
「你需要保持冷静」
and you need to be cool."

740
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:44,630
我说「好吧」
- And I was like, okay.
- I mean...

741
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:47,383
这真的是我自己恐惧的投射
And which, and which was really
a projection of my own fears

742
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,427
因为我当时想
「丹，你需要保持冷静」
because I was like,
"Dan, you need to be cool.

743
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,803
「这家伙是个大人物」
This guy's a big deal."

744
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,224
丹起初有点害怕
Dan was first a bit daunted

745
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:57,518
盖瑞非常慷慨
and Gary was amazingly generous
as a person but also as an actor.

746
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,353
作为一个人，也作为一个演员

747
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:04,400
立即接受了他
将他纳入了演技指导训练
And he immediately embrace him

748
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,066
and include him in...
in the acting process.

749
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,695
看到他们两个真的很温馨
It was really sweet
to see the two of them

750
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,199
这几乎就像是反映了这种关系
and it was almost as if
it was mirroring that relationship

751
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:17,204
因为在很多方面来说
哈利都把天狼星当成崇拜对象
because in many ways
Harry has made a totem out
of Sirius Black

752
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,207
那个崇拜对象有点难以接近
that taught him
that he's kind of unapproachable

753
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,710
而且在很多方面都很可怕
and in many ways, scary.

754
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,920
这和电影里没什么不同
And then that was not unlike
in the film

755
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:27,423
当他们发现真正的自己时
that when they discover
who they truly are

756
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,009
彼此之间有不可思议的羁绊
is when suddenly there
is an amazing bond.

757
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:32,261
你在拍摄时看到他们
And you saw them between takes
sitting with each other

758
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:35,181
坐在一起，有说有笑

759
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,055
talking and laughing

760
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:41,937
可以从丹看着盖瑞的方式
看出他有多敬爱他
and you could see in the way
that Dan looked at Gary

761
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,645
the adulation and the respect
that he had for him.

762
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:43,355
最后尖叫小屋里的那一幕
All the stuff in the Shrieking Shack
at the end, I feel like me

763
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,774
感觉就像我、鲁伯特和埃玛
在看一场厮杀大战
Rupert and Emma were just like
watching tennis in that scene

764
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:47,860
我说「这就是演技」
just being like,
"This is acting, guys

765
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:50,029
「这是我们所有人
都需要努力的方向」
this is what we all need
to working towards."

766
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,239
有蒂莫西斯波
There was Tim Spall

767
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,742
－唯一的艾伦里克曼
－是的
- the one and only, Alan Rickman.
- Yeah.

768
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:58,245
戴维休里斯、你、埃玛、鲁伯特
David Thewlis.

769
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,037
You, Emma, Rupert.

770
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,539
把我、埃玛和鲁伯特
分配在那个组中真是太好了
It's really nice of you
to include me

771
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,706
Emma and Rupert in that group.

772
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:04,376
看着你们演戏
也只是看着你们作为人
To watch you guys act but also
just watching you guys as people

773
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,504
看着这些不可思议的演员
and just watching these, like,
incredible actors who were just like

774
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,714
你们只是普通人
"Oh, yeah, no, you're just people."

775
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:10,216
你会在两者之间平衡得很好
And you'd have fun in between

776
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:12,510
整个过程完全不会痛苦
虽然可能不容易
and the whole process
doesn't have to be painful.

777
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:14,762
你有时也向我展示了神奇之处
It can be intense
- and you showed me the wonders
- Yeah.

778
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,305
这真的很重要
of that sometimes as well,
and that was really important.

779
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:17,515
－我们快杀了他
－等等
- Let's kill him.
- Wait.

780
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,433
我等过了
I did my waiting, 12 years of it

781
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,977
等了１２年

782
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:24,647
在阿兹卡班
in Azkaban.

783
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:28,943
在我的一生中，我从未拍过
有如此出色演员阵容的场景
I have never done a scene
with such an amazing cast in my life.

784
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,694
这是一颗很长的镜头
It's a very long scene

785
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:33,656
有很多曲折的镜头
it's the scene in which there
are a lot of twists inside the scene

786
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,407
真是太有趣了
and it was so much fun.

787
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:36,784
这是一个激烈的场景
It's an intense scene in
which a lot of things are at stake.

788
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,744
其中很多事情都处于危险之中

789
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,747
不，我原本还很信任你
No! I trusted you!

790
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,209
你可以看到鲁伯特、埃玛和丹
And you can see Rupert, and Emma,
and Dan

791
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,128
他们非常投入
that they are completely
committed to this scene.

792
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,632
我好喜欢
我对这场戏有美好的回忆
I love it.
I, I have such a great memory of it.

793
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,885
我告诉邓不利多
你在帮助老朋友进城堡
I told Dumbledore you were helping
an old friend into the castle

794
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,012
现在，这就是证据
and now here's the proof.

795
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,222
真厉害，石内卜
Brilliant, Snape.

796
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:02,851
再次利用敏锐和精明的脑袋
得出错误的结论
Once again, you've put your keen
and penetrating mind to the task

797
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:03,060
and as usual,
come to the wrong conclusion.

798
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,854
我一直很喜欢天狼星这个角色
I always loved the character
of Sirius

799
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:07,815
我喜欢哈利和天狼星的关系
I loved the relationship
Harry and Sirius have.

800
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,525
他就像很酷的叔叔
He's, like, this cool uncle

801
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,610
－还有哥哥，还有…
－是的
- but also older brother figure, and.
- Yeah.

802
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:14,446
他被描绘成恶棍
He's painted as this villainous guy

803
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,032
但到了关键的一刻，你会发现
and then has the switch where you go

804
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:19,785
他被陷害了，他是个好人
"Oh, he was set up."

805
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:19,785
And he's a good guy.

806
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:22,329
他是那么的善良又温暖
而且还很酷
And he's so kind and so warm

807
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:22,663
- and cool, yeah.
- And he's warm and kind and...

808
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,081
他真的很酷
- He's kind of cool.
- Yeah.

809
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:27,668
－是的
－我希望能看到所有故事
I wish I had had the whole picture.

810
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,713
－我们只是发现…
－是的，一本接着一本书
You know,
we only ever found out book.

811
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,630
- Yeah, book by book.
- I don't know whether you were

812
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:32,840
－我不知道，因为你是哈利
－我没有
- because you were Harry Potter
- Just Rickman.

813
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:34,758
里克曼有看到
- and you had a, you...
- Rickman did, that was it.

814
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,094
－里克曼？
－他有内线
- Rickman?
- He had the inside line.

815
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,387
他还假装得很好
- How did he work that one out?
- He very, very early said to Jo

816
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,139
他很早就对ＪＫ罗琳说

817
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,766
「我需要知道会发生什么事」
he was like, "I think
I need to know what happens."

818
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,351
「我需要知道」
I need to know.

819
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:48,731
给我一个理由，我求你
Give me a reason, I bet you.

820
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:50,149
里克曼会加入的，不是吗？
Rickman would have an in,
wouldn't he?

821
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:51,483
他做到了，是的
- He did, yeah.
- He, he...

822
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,444
他从未告诉克里斯
他从未告诉任何人
And he never told Chris,
never told anyone. He would...

823
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,696
克里斯会直接对他说
「你为什么要那样做？」
Chris would literally say to him,
"Why are you doing that that way?"

824
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,323
他说「我晚点告诉你」
He said, " I'll tell you later."
That was, that...

825
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,414
你会发现的
如果真的需要知道的话
Yeah, you'll find out.

826
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,080
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, on a need-to-know basis.

827
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:06,832
没错
Way to get...

828
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:10,169
丹不是童星，他是演员
Dan was not a child actor,
he was another fellow actor.

829
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:12,212
艾方索说「现在你是青少年了」
- Alfonso was like
- Right.

830
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,089
「我会像对待
青少年一样对待你」
- "Now you're teenagers
- Yeah.
and I'm gonna treat you
like a teenager."

831
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:15,257
他是第一个
And he was the first one who, like

832
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:17,926
－安排作业给我们的人
－是的
- assigned us homework.
- Yeah.

833
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,386
放松
Listen up, listen up.

834
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,347
他想了解我们
He wanted to get to know us

835
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,848
他安排了这个练习
so he set us this exercise

836
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:26,185
他让我们写一篇关于角色的作业
where he asked us
to write an essay in character.

837
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,940
他就说
「你现在理解这些角色了」
And he was like, "You know
these characters at this point better

838
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:35,069
「而我永远无法理解他们是谁」
than I'm ever gonna be able
to understand who they are

839
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,362
「所以由你来告诉我」
so you tell me."

840
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:40,157
在写了大约半张纸之后，我想说
And after about sort of
a half a side of A4

841
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,242
我几乎涵盖了所有内容
I was like, "I feel like I've
pretty much covered everything."

842
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,537
ＪＫ罗琳写了五百页
Like, Jo's written a good 500 pages
about this

843
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:48,207
但我觉得我总结得差不多
but I feel like this one
pretty much sums it up.

844
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,417
感觉蛮不错的，就这样吧
Great. Okay, yeah, cool.
Proud of that, bring that in.

845
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:55,964
埃玛写了１２页，写得很好
Of course, Emma writes, like,
12 pages, like, beautifully written.

846
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:00,052
鲁伯特没有交任何东西
Rupert didn't deliver anything.

847
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:01,387
我没有写
I didn't do it.

848
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,806
我说「鲁伯特，你的作业呢？」
And I said,
"Rupert, where's your assignment?"

849
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:08,727
他说「我以为荣恩不会写」
And he says, "Well,
I thought that Ron wouldn't do it.

850
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,980
「所以我没有写」
So I didn't do it."

851
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:14,316
幸好艾方索看到了…
I mean, luckily Alfonso kind of saw
that it was very in character

852
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,403
没有这样做对我来说
非常符合角色

853
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,403
for me not to have done it.

854
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:20,906
鲁伯特就是荣恩
Rupert is Ron.

855
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,867
他是荣恩，百分之百
He's Ron 100 percent.

856
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:29,039
埃玛就是这样一个
毫不费力的演员
Emma is just
such an effortless actor.

857
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,457
她准备了很多
She prepares a lot.

858
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,545
在拍摄时，好像一切
都从她身上流出来了
When you are doing the scenes

859
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,545
it's as if everything
is just flowing out of her.

860
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,548
真相是，他们是很棒的演员
The truth of the matter is that
they are great actors.

861
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,760
天狼星布莱克找到了救赎
Sirius Black finds a redemption

862
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:46,223
透过让哈利了解他的真实身份
by having Harry understanding
who he truly is.

863
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:50,018
这是一个伟大的解放
伟大的自由的时刻
It's, it's a moment of,
of great liberation, of great freedom

864
00:38:50,102 --> 00:38:55,816
而这一切都透过他们两个
在有着银月的夜空飞翔
and all of this
is conveyed symbolically

865
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,359
in the two of them flying
in the night under the silver moon.

866
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,192
而传达出来

867
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,324
这就像一个家庭，不是吗？
- It was like a family, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

868
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:08,036
－是的
－这是最难能可贵的经验
More than any other experience.

869
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,747
从来没有在电影里有过这种经验
But you never have that in the movies

870
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,083
因为你和一群人一起工作
并且你对他们很友好
because you've worked
with a bunch of people

871
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:12,875
and you get friendly with them

872
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,961
你之后将再也见不到大多数人
and then most of them,
you would never see again.

873
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:19,381
但是有了这部电影，你会回来的
But with Potter, you would come,
you would come back and...

874
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,884
这就是这部电影的可贵之处
- Yeah, that that's what made it
- I, yeah.

875
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:25,095
在许多事情中
这让这部电影如此特别
amongst many things,
what made it very special.

876
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:27,389
是的，感觉就像…
- Yeah. It just feels like, you know
- Yeah.

877
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:29,600
在这里
你会成为电影史的一部分
being in these,
you get to be a part of film history.

878
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:36,273
（全新的时代）

879
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:45,032
霍格沃茨被选中举办三强争霸赛
Hogwarts has been chosen
to host the Triwizard Tournament.

880
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:49,036
{\an5}火杯的考验
Goblet of Fire, doing all
of the Triwizard Tournament stuff

881
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,247
{\an5}在所有三强争霸赛期间

882
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:57,127
融入这样魔法般的场景
it was so lovely to be surprised
and blown away

883
00:39:57,211 --> 00:40:04,218
让人觉得很不可思议
and, like, taken away
by the magic of the scenes

884
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:03,884
and to be surprised.

885
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,304
我记得看到波巴洞入场的样子
Like, I remember
seeing the Beauxbatons come

886
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,764
and do their entrance,
and the Durmstrangs.

887
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:08,680
和德姆斯特朗

888
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:10,766
真的很酷
It was really cool.

889
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:15,687
在第四部电影中
我们想要一位英国导演
With the fourth film,
we wanted a British director.

890
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,356
我们想要一些非常戏剧化的东西
We wanted something quite theatrical.

891
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:18,732
停，非常感谢你
Cut. Thank you very much.

892
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:23,821
麦可就是这么兴奋又吵闹
Mike is just this excited, loud,
passionate man.

893
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,781
他是个热情的男人

894
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,409
他是那部电影的完美导演
He was a perfect director
for that film.

895
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,037
真的，就像夸张的…
It was a really, like, bombastic,
action-packed

896
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,916
动感十足、精彩、古怪的电影

897
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:35,916
wonderful, eccentric film.

898
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,167
我爱麦可，他很棒
I love Mike, he was great.

899
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,670
他几乎就像书中角色一样
I mean, he was almost like
he was from the books.

900
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:42,589
他就像霍格沃茨的角色
He was like a Hogwarts character.

901
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,925
{\an5}第四本书是其中最厚的一本书
The fourth book
is the biggest of them

902
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:47,636
{\an5}大约有九百页，像门挡
it's about 900 pages,
it's a doorstop.

903
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,012
{\an5}像砖头一样
It's a house brick.

904
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,472
开始
Action!

905
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:55,644
我想如果需要让这些孩子
乖乖坐好听话
And I thought

906
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,644
if it's really gonna nail
the little darlings to their seats

907
00:40:55,727 --> 00:41:01,525
那就会需要一个
强大又充满活力的核心人物
then it has to have this great,
big, energetic core to it.

908
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,736
他就是这样，能量满满
He was just this kind of, like,
firecracker of energy.

909
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,405
他对事物充满好奇
He gets so excited by things.

910
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:10,659
{\an5}他有一种很童趣的特质
And there was this kind
of really endearing, like

911
00:41:08,824 --> 00:41:11,201
childlike quality to, to him.

912
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,911
他也很幽默
He loved the humor as well

913
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:15,372
总是会在每个场景中制造欢乐
and would always try
and find it in every scene.

914
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:20,252
我大概只有对几部电影
感到有点紧张
It was probably
only a couple of films in

915
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,502
that I sort of started
to feel nervous.

916
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,378
我记得
- And I remember, it was Mike Newell.
- Yeah, things changed

917
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:23,380
哥伦布离开后，事情发生了变化
when, when Columbus left.

918
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:24,715
肯定有点不同
It was definitely a bit
of a difference.

919
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,800
那是一种不同的氛围
我认为麦可尼维尔
- Yeah.
- It was a different vibe.
And then Mike Newell.

920
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,385
麦可像对待成年人一样对待我们
Mike treated us like adults.

921
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:29,595
－没错
－是的
- That was it.
- Yeah.

922
00:41:29,678 --> 00:41:31,513
－的确
－是的
- He did, I suppose.
- Yeah.

923
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:33,223
{\an5}我们在片场玩得很开心
We did have fun on set.

924
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,147
我非常喜欢的韦斯利双胞胎
The Weasley twins, whom I, I
was very fond of, they had to fight.

925
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,691
他们不得不打一架

926
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:47,237
{\an5}当弗雷德和乔治
被拒绝参与三强争霸赛
We were doing the scene
when Fred and George

927
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,029
are rejected from entering
the Triwizard Tournament

928
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:50,115
我们戴上假发和胡须
and then we had these wigs on
and beards on

929
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:51,450
看起来像老男人
what looked like old men.

930
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,369
麦可说「你们会互相看不顺眼」
And Mike said,
"Okay, so I think you guys

931
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:54,369
would be really annoyed
with each other

932
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:56,204
「你们应该好好打一架」
I think you should have
a little fight about this."

933
00:41:56,288 --> 00:42:00,292
这两个人打得很不干脆
These two were sort of
prissing about at it.

934
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,044
卡
Cut!

935
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:04,630
我说「孩子们，不会吧？
你们是在打架耶」
And I said, "No, come on boys,
really, it's a fight."

936
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:06,590
麦可刚走过来说「不行…」
Mike just came over and said,
"No, no, no."

937
00:42:06,673 --> 00:42:08,216
谁想打架？
Okay, who wants to fight?

938
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,303
我就像白痴一样说「我想」
And like an idiot,
I was like, "Yeah, okay."

939
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:15,807
我那时是个６０岁的胖子
Well, of course, I was a tubby,
60-year-old gent at that stage

940
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:20,270
我真的不应该这样做
and I really shouldn't have done it.

941
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:24,775
他向我扑了过去，就像这样
And so he dived on me,
and like just went like this

942
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:27,945
我也对他做了同样的事情
to which is said "Oh, okay,"
so I did the same to him.

943
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,948
我记得搂着他的腰
I remember gripping him
around the waist

944
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:33,367
并试图甩开他
and trying to fling him about
and so forth

945
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,036
结果弄断了几根肋骨
and cracked a couple of ribs.

946
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,539
所以从那时起
我就处于极度的痛苦之中
And so was in absolute agony from,
from then on, but of course

947
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,000
当然，美妙的事情在于
the wonderful thing was that
I had made a complete twit of myself

948
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,795
我做了一个彻头彻尾的蠢事

949
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:47,673
但之后大家都演得好多了
and everybody felt much better
for that.

950
00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:50,592
真的不该弄断导演的肋骨
You know when you shouldn't break
a director's rib?

951
00:42:55,681 --> 00:43:00,477
（空中魔法）

952
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,689
在「火杯的考验」中
In the Goblet of Fire, that film is
just all about teenagers, you know

953
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:08,610
那部电影是关于
青少年的第一次暗恋

954
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:09,486
having crushes for the first time,
asking someone to the date

955
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:11,071
邀请某人约会，去圣诞舞会
to the Yule Ball.

956
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:14,157
反映了你经历的那些尴尬的阶段
They just mirrored all those kind
of awkward phases you go through

957
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,493
作为一个青少年
大家都感同身受
as a teenager,
and they really felt like that too

958
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:19,037
因为我们确实有相同的经历
because we were literally
having the same experiences.

959
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:21,873
在准备和指导的时候
The amount of, like,
prep and coaching Emma and I

960
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:25,043
埃玛和我会互相发简讯
比如给异性发简讯
would give each other on, like,
texting to the opposite sex, like

961
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:27,295
如果她给男孩发简讯
或者我给女孩发简讯
if we, if she was texting a boy
or I was texting a girl

962
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:28,922
我会说
「她回了我这么多亲吻符号」
I'd be like, "She sent me
this many kisses back

963
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,632
「我该怎么办？这是一场噩梦」
it what do I do?
This is a nightmare."

964
00:43:30,716 --> 00:43:34,219
我们就像兄妹
We had that kind of older brother,
younger sister thing.

965
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:36,471
就荷尔蒙大爆发的时期而言
It was a very interesting film

966
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,348
这是一部非常有趣的电影
in terms of a lot of hormones
flying around.

967
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:43,395
有暗恋，约会然后分手
There was crushes

968
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,103
and people went out with each other
and broke up

969
00:43:43,478 --> 00:43:45,772
{\an5}就像我以前在学校那样
and just like you'd do in,
just like I used to do at school.

970
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,191
{\an5}完全一样的环境
It was exactly the same environment

971
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,527
但是在黑魔法防御术课上
but it was just in a defense
against the dark arts class.

972
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:57,200
那部电影至少对我来说
可能是荷尔蒙高峰
That film was probably peak hormone,
at least for me.

973
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:00,370
（每日先知）

974
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,622
这正是你所期望的
It was exactly what you would expect

975
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:07,335
尤其是第四部电影
有波巴洞和德姆兰的学生
and especially, like, the fourth film
was the one with, like

976
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,085
the Beauxbatons and the Durmstrangs.

977
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:11,548
有一群荷尔蒙过剩的青少年
So, like, you had a bunch of, like,
hormonal teenagers anyway

978
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:13,425
带来两大群人
and then, like, bring in
two massive groups of new people

979
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:17,345
新人，所有人
故意让这部电影变得很性感

980
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,387
all of them are, like,
purposefully hot for the film.

981
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,890
所以…
So it's, yeah, it was...

982
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:21,558
那部电影是…一切都开始了
That, that film was, yeah,
it was all kicking off.

983
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:24,394
为什么她们要成群结队的？
Why do they have to travel in packs?

984
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,524
他就像一个笨拙的少年
非常不起眼
He is just like
slightly awkward teenage boy

985
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:29,149
in a very unremarkable way

986
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:32,611
这对故事中的主角来说非比寻常
which I suppose
feels sort of remarkable

987
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,944
for a hero character in something.

988
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,989
你杀了龙
如果你不能约会，谁可以？
You saved dragons.

989
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:35,822
If you can't get a date, who can?

990
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,824
我现在宁愿去杀龙
I think I'd take the dragon
right now.

991
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,244
ＪＫ罗琳把那些年的他
写的非常亲切
Jo wrote him very endearingly
in those years

992
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:46,625
我觉得这不需要耗费一大场戏
and I feel like
it did not take a huge acting stretch

993
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:51,379
让我利用我的尴尬
呈现书呆子少年的一面
for me to tap into my awkward
nerdy teenage side.

994
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:52,506
秋
Jo?

995
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:54,758
是的？
Yes?

996
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:58,804
你愿意和我一起去舞会吗？
I just wondered if maybe
you wanna go to the ball with me?

997
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:02,015
抱歉，我没听懂
Sorry? I didn't catch that.

998
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:04,226
这显然是一个成长的故事
It obviously was a coming
of age story.

999
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:11,942
圣诞舞会是其中一个大场面
One of the, the big,
big sequences was the Christmas Ball.

1000
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:16,238
圣诞舞会首先是…
The Yule Ball is first
and foremost a dance.

1001
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,490
一支舞

1002
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,577
学生们学跳舞时的场景
The scene when the students
are learning to dance

1003
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:25,497
这很像那个时代典型的学校舞会
it was pretty much like
a typical school dance of that age.

1004
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,166
一边是女孩，一边是男孩
You've got girls on one side,
boys on the other.

1005
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,710
我们在牛津的一个大房间里
We were in a big room in Oxford.

1006
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:34,589
玛吉就在中间
说「我来教你们跳舞」
Maggie is right in the middle,
and she says

1007
00:45:32,754 --> 00:45:34,589
"Right,
I'm gonna teach you to dance."

1008
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,758
她当然选了鲁伯特
Of course, she picks Rupert
and she says...

1009
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:38,593
然后她说…

1010
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:41,471
把右手放在我的腰上
Place your right hand on my waist.

1011
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:42,597
哪里？
What?

1012
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:46,268
孩子都１４岁了，一定会很尴尬
The kid's 14
and he knows how to get a laugh.

1013
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:47,644
太棒了
It's great.

1014
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:50,272
好奇怪，我觉得很不自在
And weirdly,
I felt quite self-conscious about it.

1015
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:54,401
我也不知道
我以前从未和女士跳舞
I didn't really know,
I had never danced with a lady before

1016
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:56,153
所以这是一种非常新的体验
so it was kind of a very new thing.

1017
00:45:57,112 --> 00:45:59,030
千万别让他忘记这一刻
Never gonna let me forget this,
are you?

1018
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:00,157
－好
－好
- Never.
- Never.

1019
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,617
当然了
詹姆斯和奥利弗那对双胞胎
And yeah, of course, that
James and Oliver, the twins

1020
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:05,245
他们不断嘲笑我
they were constantly
kind of ruining me.

1021
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:07,122
我们在捉弄他
- We were winding him up
- And we would wind up

1022
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,166
－事先就开始捉弄了
－在我们开始拍摄前
- anyway beforehand, we were like...
- before we started filming.

1023
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:12,460
在我们拍摄之前，他们说服我
They kind of convinced me
before we filmed it

1024
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:14,629
有舞蹈编排
that there was this whole like,
dance routine planned.

1025
00:46:14,713 --> 00:46:16,506
我们说
「你还不知道怎么做吗？」
We were like,
"Oh, do you know your steps?"

1026
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:20,510
「就是舞蹈编排啊
我们都有舞蹈编排」
Hey? And it's like,
"No, you know, the routine.

1027
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:22,512
「过去六周都是」
Like, we've all been doing a routine
for like the past six weeks
or something like that."

1028
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:25,390
只是试图建立压力
Just tried to build the pressure.

1029
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:27,559
就这样
And this way.

1030
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:30,145
不，你最终将带领舞伴
Now, you will have to lead
eventually.

1031
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:31,438
明白了吗？
Understood?

1032
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:32,522
Cut!

1033
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:37,277
最迷人的日子之一是大舞会
One of the most enchanting days
was the great ball

1034
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,615
{\an5}因为有很多年轻貌美的演员
because there was all these
incredibly beautiful young people

1035
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,824
{\an5}穿着漂亮的衣裳
perfectly dressed.

1036
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:45,827
该死
Bloody hell.

1037
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,335
那些是什么？
What are those?

1038
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,293
What are those?

1039
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:54,920
我的礼服长袍
My dress robes.

1040
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:58,006
我们穿的西装有非常宽的翻领
The suits we had on were like
really, really wide lapels and long

1041
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:01,134
和长长的下摆，你没有…
sort of, tails and yeah

1042
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:05,096
完全都不觉得很酷
you didn't, you didn't feel cool at,
at really any point in that.

1043
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,057
我看起来像我的大姨妈泰西
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie.

1044
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:12,187
我闻起来像我的大姨妈泰西
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

1045
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,398
我只记得，那套礼服真的很扯
All I can remember is that,
like, really aggressive, like

1046
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:19,361
－有六层领子的东西？
－小褶边的东西
six layer collar thing you had on.

1047
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:19,277
Oh, the little frill thing, yeah.

1048
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:23,073
其实我有点喜欢
非常有韦斯利的风格
But actually, I kind of loved it.

1049
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:23,156
It was kind of, it was very Weasley.

1050
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:25,242
－是的，很完美
－但我表现得很赞
- Yeah, it was perfect.
- I felt, I pulled it off.

1051
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,743
没有人能像我这样
Not a lot of people
could pull it off.

1052
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:28,495
埃玛看起来很漂亮
Emma obviously looked beautiful,
and was in an incredible dress.

1053
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:30,747
穿着一件令人难以置信的礼服

1054
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,583
我和鲁伯特看起来像…我不知道
And me and Rupert looked like,
I don't know, Austin Powers mates

1055
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:37,170
奥斯汀鲍尔斯的伙伴
或其他人在一旁
or something,
hanging out at the side.

1056
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,382
她看起来很漂亮
She looks beautiful.

1057
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,677
我第一次觉得哈利和荣恩…
I think for the first time,
Harry and Ron

1058
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,220
尤其是荣恩
particularly Ron

1059
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:51,184
把妙丽看成一个年轻的女人
see Hermione as a young woman

1060
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:55,230
而不仅仅是一般的三人组
not just this kind of side kick
that they each have.

1061
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:57,440
那是妙丽格兰杰吗？
Is that Hermione Granger
with Viktor Krum?

1062
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,984
和维克多喀浪一起？

1063
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,404
不，绝对不可能
No. Absolutely not.

1064
00:48:03,863 --> 00:48:05,824
每个人都有这样的经验
I mean, everyone can kind
of relate to that

1065
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:07,534
这就是我喜欢这些故事的原因
that's what I kind of love
about these stories

1066
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:10,495
与每个人的生活相关
is they sit so parallel
to everyone's life

1067
00:48:10,578 --> 00:48:12,539
像是第一场学校舞会
like the first school dance
and those kind of emotions

1068
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,833
还有那种情绪

1069
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:18,253
那些焦虑，不安全感
those, those anxieties, insecurities.

1070
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:21,756
我知道这是一件大事，我很痛苦
I knew it was a big deal,
and I was miserable.

1071
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,091
我…
I, I just knew it was the, like,
duckling becomes a swan moment

1072
00:48:23,174 --> 00:48:28,013
我只知道这是
丑小鸭变成天鹅的时刻

1073
00:48:28,096 --> 00:48:30,682
突然间所有压力都来到我肩上
and, you know, it was just like
all of this pressure suddenly.

1074
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:33,518
不要甩手臂好吗？
Now, don't swing your arms, okay?

1075
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:37,272
麦可尼维尔教我
穿着礼服走下楼梯
Mike Newell coached me
to walk down the stairs in the dress.

1076
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,691
「你的手臂甩得太厉害了
你走得太快了」
Your arms are swinging too much

1077
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:41,484
you're walking too quickly,
you need to walk slower.

1078
00:48:39,774 --> 00:48:41,651
「你需要走得慢一点」

1079
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:44,946
他教我走下楼梯的一百万种方式
Like, he's giving me
a million different directions

1080
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:44,904
about how to walk down the stairs

1081
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,365
后来我从楼梯上摔下来了
and of course,
I fell down the stairs.

1082
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:51,911
我们是一群非常不自在的青少年
We were a bunch
of very self-conscious teenagers

1083
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:54,331
that were like, you're gonna
learn some dance steps for this.

1084
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,080
你会为此学习一些舞步

1085
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,999
你相信我吧？
You trust me, don't you?

1086
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:58,376
好吧，我不是舞者
我永远不会跳舞
I am not a dancer,
and I will never be able to dance.

1087
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,255
我觉得我在跳舞时很僵硬
Yeah, I feel like I'm pretty rigid
in, in that dance scene.

1088
00:49:06,051 --> 00:49:08,470
看…
Oh, look at that, look at that.
Stylish.

1089
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:10,388
幸运的人
Lucky man, lucky man.

1090
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:13,725
埃玛和我一直很相爱，真的
Emma and I have always
loved each other, really.

1091
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:16,728
我走进指导室
I walked into the room
where we were having tutoring.

1092
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:21,733
我们要画出心中认为上帝的样子
The assignment that had been given

1093
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,274
was to draw
what you thought God looked like.

1094
00:49:21,816 --> 00:49:26,696
汤姆在滑板上
画了一个帽子反戴的女孩
And Tom had drawn a girl
with a backward cap on a skateboard.

1095
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:31,159
不知道该怎么说，我爱上了他
And I just don't know to say it,
like I just fell in love with him.

1096
00:49:31,242 --> 00:49:33,078
我在化妆椅上
I think I was in the hair
and makeup chair

1097
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:34,245
（跩哥马份）

1098
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:37,415
有人说「她对你有好感」
and someone said
something along the lines of

1099
00:49:36,164 --> 00:49:37,415
"Yeah, she had a crush on you."

1100
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:42,003
我以前每天都进来在课表上
找他的号码，是７号
I used to come in every day

1101
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,668
and look for his number
on the call sheet.

1102
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:42,170
It was number seven.

1103
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:45,256
如果他的号码在课表上
And if it, if his number
was on the call sheet

1104
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,384
那将会是令人兴奋一整天
it was an extra exciting day.

1105
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:51,137
他比我年长三年，所以对他来说
He was three years above me,
and so for him, he was like

1106
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,348
我是他的小妹妹
"You're like my little sister."

1107
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:55,642
我变得非常保护她
I was, became very protective
over her.

1108
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:58,728
我一直对她情有独钟
Yeah, I've always
had a soft spot for, for her.

1109
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:01,022
一直到今天都是
And that continues to the day.

1110
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:03,149
我认为像是…
I think, really, the truth of it
was Tom was the one

1111
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:09,072
我跟汤姆在一起不用装坚强

1112
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:08,988
that I could often be
more vulnerable with.

1113
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:11,866
我们总有一种亲切感
There's always been something
that's like, I don't know, a kinship.

1114
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,079
我们之间没有任何浪漫情怀
Nothing has ever, ever, ever, ever
happened romantically with us

1115
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:17,372
我们纯粹很敬爱彼此
we just love each other.

1116
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:20,333
我只能说这么多
That's all I can say about that.

1117
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:29,175
－一起来，一、二、三
－二、三
- Together. One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1118
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:39,185
在「火杯的考验」里
宇宙改变了
In the Goblet of Fire

1119
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:43,648
the universe shifts and suddenly,
there is Voldemort.

1120
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:43,773
突然间有了佛地魔

1121
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,362
（那个不能说出名字的人）

1122
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,282
我选了罗夫费恩斯
I cast Ralph Fiennes

1123
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:56,619
是因为他是那一代
最会演的演员之一
because he's one of the most
potent actors of his generation

1124
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:59,664
我知道他有很强的力量
and I knew that he had a great force,
just kind of delicate

1125
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:04,002
他有细腻微妙的人格力量

1126
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,461
subtle force of personality.

1127
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:09,257
我姊妹当时有约十几岁大的孩子
My sister has children who were
then around 10, 11, 12.

1128
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,802
{\an5}我说「马莎，我没听过
哈利波特和佛地魔」
I said, "Martha, I don't know about
this Harry Potter thing, Voldemort.

1129
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:14,220
{\an5}「那是什么？」
What's that?"

1130
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,765
{\an5}她说「什么？
你受邀饰演佛地魔？」
"What? You're being asked
to play Voldemort?

1131
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,434
「你一定要演」
You've got to do it."

1132
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:28,818
然后他们给我看了
绘图和外观的设计概念
Yes, when I was shown some drawings

1133
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:30,820
of design ideas for the look,
I wasn't expecting that.

1134
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:31,404
我没有预期是那个样子

1135
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,615
我想「这外观真强烈」
And I thought,
"Wow, that's a strong look."

1136
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:36,451
我那时不觉得佛地魔是人
I didn't feel Voldemort
was that human.

1137
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:38,870
我觉得他是邪恶的精髓
I felt he was the essence of evil.

1138
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:40,538
我知道他当过人类
I know he's been human,
but he's become a snake-like thing.

1139
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:42,999
但他成了跟蛇一样的人

1140
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:47,128
声音是像蛇低语那般沙哑
So there was the voice,
that sort of snake-like whispered

1141
00:51:46,127 --> 00:51:52,008
husky, something that I suppose
I was sort of whispering voice

1142
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:51,424
我认为像是低语的声音

1143
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:53,885
呼吸的声音
breath on the breath.

1144
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,221
「哈利波特」
Ah, Harry Potter.

1145
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:58,515
来受死吧
Come to die?

1146
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:03,770
罗夫想变得极端邪恶超凡
Ralph wanted to be ultimately evil
and other worldly.

1147
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:07,857
最棒的方法就是拿掉他的鼻子
And the best way to do that
was to take his nose off.

1148
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,610
他是有鼻子，剧透警告
He does have a nose, spoiler alert.

1149
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:12,862
他浑身满是贴纸
And he was covered in stickers.

1150
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:16,908
所以他看起来没屏幕上那么吓人
So, he was slightly less intimidating
than on screen.

1151
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:18,618
他们说「开演」时除外
Except when they called action

1152
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:20,662
不知怎地，我很怕他
when for some reason
I was terrified of him.

1153
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,998
可以碰你了
I can touch you.

1154
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,376
要花三个钟头化妆
It took about three hours in makeup

1155
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:28,545
画手、指甲、牙齿
the painting of the hands,
the nails, the teeth.

1156
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:31,130
连我的鼻子都不例外
And even with my nose, I felt...

1157
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,217
我感觉…

1158
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,681
很强壮，感觉很强大
strong. It felt powerful.
It felt evil.

1159
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:41,391
感觉很邪恶

1160
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,478
最重要的是
What was big was that one
of the people that you assume

1161
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:49,607
大家以为会是故事中的重要人物

1162
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:51,359
is going to be very important
in the story is Cedric Diggory.

1163
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:51,609
西追迪哥里

1164
00:52:51,693 --> 00:52:55,822
在那场对抗之中，西追被杀害
In that confrontation Cedric
is killed.

1165
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:57,782
把多余的人杀了
Kill the spare.

1166
00:52:57,865 --> 00:53:00,076
－啊哇呾喀呾啦
－不，西追
- Avada Kedavra!
- Cedric!

1167
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,122
而哈利呢…
And Harry,
he manages to take the body

1168
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:07,208
他带走了尸体

1169
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:12,297
在比赛最后被迫降
and crash land back
at the end of the competition

1170
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,092
西追迪哥里的父亲
以为他儿子赢了
and Cedric Diggory's father
believes that his son has won

1171
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:19,178
然后他发现他孩子死了
and then he realizes the kid is dead
and he howls like a dog.

1172
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,556
他就跟狗一样哀号

1173
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,016
我的儿子
It's my boy!

1174
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:27,895
儿子
My boy!

1175
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,068
突然间，完全出乎预料
事情变得很严重
Suddenly something
completely unexpected

1176
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,527
and serious happens.

1177
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:38,990
你突然了解这部电影
不是讲生命，而是讲死亡
And suddenly you realize
that this move is not about life.

1178
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:39,032
It's about death.

1179
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:43,369
那一幕很重要
因为那也是哈利第一次
It's such a massive scene

1180
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:42,952
because it is also the first time
Harry, sort of

1181
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:47,332
感觉年轻人的死亡这么靠近他
feels that kind of death
of somebody young, close to him.

1182
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,044
我在那一幕很清楚地想
That's a scene I remember
really distinctly going

1183
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,754
「这是儿童电影」
"Oh, this is, yes,
these are kid's films but my God

1184
00:53:52,837 --> 00:53:54,589
「但是天啊，这主题真沉重」
there's some challenging stuff
in there.

1185
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:56,549
他回来了…
He's back. He's back.

1186
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,052
佛地魔王他回来了
Voldemort's back.

1187
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,387
西追迪哥里去世那一刻
The moment of Cedric Diggory's death

1188
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,516
是这一系列变成熟的时刻
is the moment when the series
comes of age

1189
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:10,063
现在，儿童脱离了童年
and now the children
have left childhood

1190
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,901
得面对成年的危险
and are going to have to confront
the perils of adulthood

1191
00:54:14,984 --> 00:54:17,779
都从那一刻的死亡开始
and it all comes
from that moment of death.

1192
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:22,325
西追迪哥里被佛地魔谋杀了
Cedric Diggory was murdered
by Lord Voldemort.

1193
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,287
他们三个面对逆境
The three of them,
they're in adversity

1194
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:30,249
因此建立了我们所知的友谊
and that forges friendships
as we know.

1195
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:43,012
「简而言之你受到
你能爱人的能力保护」
"You are protected, in short,
by your ability to love"

1196
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:45,765
邓不利多大声说
said Dumbledore loudly.

1197
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:48,601
「唯一有作用的保护」
"The only protection
that can possibly work

1198
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,105
「能对抗像佛地魔
这种力量诱惑的唯一保护」
against the lure of power
like Voldemort's.

1199
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:57,777
「即使你忍受所有诱惑和苦难」
In spite of all the temptation
you have endured

1200
00:54:55,942 --> 00:55:01,072
all the suffering,
you remain pure of heart."

1201
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,822
「你的心还保持纯洁」

1202
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,867
（第三章，内心的光明与黑暗）

（哈利波特：凤凰会的密令）

1204

（哈利波特：混血王子的背叛）

1205

{\an5}（海伦娜宝汉卡特
饰贝拉雷斯壮）

1207
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:17,255
{\an5}你让我们在这里访谈真好
It's so nice of you.
Let's do this in your house.

1208
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:18,965
{\an5}我知道，这样真好
I know, it's too nice.

1209
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:21,634
你知道我一直想做什么吗？
You know what I've always
wanted to do?

1210
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,721
{\an5}看我们办不办得到
我想上去这里
Let me see if we can,
is get up here.

1211
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:26,347
{\an5}（斜角巷，古灵阁巫师银行）

1212
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:28,433
{\an5}你看，他们看起来不太健康
Oh, look, they really don't look
very well.

1213
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,270
－他们都还在这里
－对啊
- They're all still here.
- They're really still here.

1214
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:35,523
有人喂他们吃饭吗？真悲哀
I mean, has anyone fed them?
It is so sad.

1215
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:38,609
－好，你当哈利波特
－好，了解
- Okay, now you can be Harry Potter.
- Oh, yeah.

1216
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:39,235
Okay, thank you.

1217
00:55:41,362 --> 00:55:44,031
－我往右走，你往左走
－我们来比赛，好吗？
I'll go down the right,
you go down the left.

1218
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,865
Yeah, and let's race. Okay?

1219
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:45,491
预备，准备，开始
- Okay.
- On your mark, get set, go.

1220
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,868
天啊
Oh, God.

1221
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,412
这里下不去
We're snogging down here.

1222
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:51,789
过去
Get over it.

1223
00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:54,667
{\an5}你知道吗？我照了一张照片
You know what?
I took a photograph of something.

1224
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,920
我昨晚挖出这些东西
Last night I thought
I'm gonna just dig up these things

1225
00:55:58,004 --> 00:55:59,797
我要求了你的签名
and I asked for your autograph.

1226
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:01,424
天啊，我写了什么？
Oh, God, what did I write?

1227
00:56:01,507 --> 00:56:04,802
不，大声念出来，看到你真好
No, read it out.
It's so nice to see you.

1228
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:06,095
上面写什么？
- God.
- What does it say?

1229
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,680
－「亲爱的海伦娜宝汉卡特」
－对
- "Dear HBC...
- Yeah.

1230
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,559
「我很荣幸当你的
共演演员和杯垫」
It was a pleasure being
your costar and coaster.

1231
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,270
我这个双关语真好笑
What a... What a clever pun
I made when I was...

1232
00:56:14,353 --> 00:56:16,022
－真好笑
－我真的
That was clever.
- I mean, I'm honestly

1233
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,232
－还蛮满意的
－你那时候很诗意，对
- still kind of pleased with that.
- You were poetic. Yeah, yeah.

1234
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,485
「因为我总沦落到帮你端咖啡」
"in the sense that I always ended up
holding your coffee. I do love you."

1235
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,820
－「我爱你」
－然后怎么说？

1236
00:56:21,736 --> 00:56:22,820
Then what does it say?

1237
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:28,993
－你可以念出来
－我可以，我们可以跟观众分享
- You can share.
- I can.

1238
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:32,038
我说「我爱你
只希望能提早出生十年」
We can share this now. I said,
"I do love you

1239
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,996
and I just wish I'd been born
10 years earlier.

1240
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:33,414
「我可能还有一点机会」
I might have been in with a chance."

1241
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:34,665
现在没关系了
It's all right now.

1242
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:36,250
「爱你，感谢你这么酷」
"Lots of love
and thanks for being cool."

1243
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,376
很贴心对吧？
Isn't it nice?
No, I shall always treasure that.

1244
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,545
－我会永远珍惜这个
－谢谢

1245
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,422
- Thank you.
- That is in my toilet, Dan.

1246
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,297
接下来就会出现在
我的马桶里了，丹

1247
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:49,847
风暴要来了，哈利
There's a storm coming, Harry.

1248
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:51,891
风暴来时，我们最好准备好
We'd all best be ready when she does.

1249
00:56:58,147 --> 00:57:00,691
我在第五部电影里
「凤凰会的密令」
I was in four, number five,
Order of the Phoenix.

1250
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:01,943
看，我带了我的假牙
- Yeah.
- Look, I got my teeth.

1251
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:03,653
－海伦娜带了她的假牙
－我的假牙，我认为…
- Helena has brought her teeth.
- My teeth. I think, no...

1252
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,989
她跟我保证过
她没清过这副假牙
She has assured me that she's done
literally nothing to these

1253
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,908
- in terms of, cleaning...
- No, these are actual relic.

1254
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:08,741
不，这是真正的古物

1255
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,493
已经１１年了，而且…
It was 11 years in...

1256
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,578
－对
－对，闻起来有点臭
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it smells a bit wifty. But...

1257
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:13,788
可是…

1258
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:15,873
－你要把假牙放进你嘴里
－但这副牙齿很有帮助
- You're just gonna put them...
- No, but the teeth were helpful.

1259
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,249
Just gonna put them right
in your mouth, yeah.

1260
00:57:15,957 --> 00:57:17,458
－好，放进去了
－对
Okay. In they go.

1261
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,752
－你认为呢？
－对，我都忘了
- What do you think?
- Yeah. I'd forgotten.

1262
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,213
－你记得我吗？
－我记得这个，对
Do you... do you remember me?

1263
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:22,296
I remember these, yeah.

1264
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,844
－假牙很有帮助
－帮你演出那个角色
- The teeth helped.
- With the character?

1265
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:29,595
我认为我当时想伪装
I think I wanted to be in camouflage.

1266
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,974
我一开始受邀演出时
ＪＫ罗琳传给我一则秘密讯息
When I was first offered it
Joe sent me a secret message

1267
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:36,769
「剧本里也许没有太多描述
但她会做出大事」
saying like, "There might not
be much on the page

1268
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:36,644
but she's gonna do
something significant."

1269
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,020
贝拉这个角色很有趣
With Bellatrix it was fun
because it was posturing

1270
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:41,691
因为这个角色
有幼稚和顽皮的个性
the childish and the naughty.

1271
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:42,942
我说…
I was just like...

1272
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:44,402
－完全无政府主义
－精神病态，对
- and totally anarchist...
- And the psychopath.

1273
00:57:44,485 --> 00:57:45,987
她有种胡闹的感觉
Yeah, there's like a playfulness
to her

1274
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,989
－有胡闹感
－所以更令人不安
- There was the playfulness.
- which is like even more disturbing.

1275
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:49,574
当然了，贝拉不觉得自己很邪恶
Of course Bellatrix
doesn't think she's evil.

1276
00:57:49,657 --> 00:57:50,825
－不
－刚好相反
- No.
- She thinks she's the opposite.

1277
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:52,326
－对
－所以我得建构出
- Right.
- So, I had to sort of construct

1278
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,538
她伤害人的理由
a reason for why
she should hurt people and why

1279
00:57:55,621 --> 00:57:58,833
以及她为什么这么麻木
for her, she is desensitized.

1280
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:01,294
这让她觉得自己很强大
It makes her feel powerful.

1281
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:05,715
小波特
Itty, bitty Potter.

1282
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:08,134
Yeah!

1283
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,098
{\an5}贝拉是个控制不了的狂野人物
Bellatrix was just this wild thing
that was uncontrollable.

1284
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:18,019
你不知道她会说出什么话
You can really know what's gonna
come out of her mouth next.

1285
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:20,646
这对演员来说很兴奋
Very exciting for an actor
because it's like

1286
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,273
因为她不管在那个镜头拍什么
whatever she did on that take

1287
00:58:22,356 --> 00:58:25,109
不代表她下个镜头会演得一样
does not mean she's gonna do
the same one the next.

1288
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:27,361
我记得自己想主宰那场戏
I remember trying to be
in charge of the scene

1289
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:29,614
而她就纯粹想做什么就做什么
and her just having the best time.

1290
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:32,116
她想做什么都没人会管她
She's just allowed to do anything
she wanted.

1291
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:33,784
她可以咯咯笑、她可以上下跳…
She could cackle,
she could jump up and down.

1292
00:58:33,868 --> 00:58:35,202
冷静
Calm down.

1293
00:58:35,286 --> 00:58:37,163
想说什么就说什么
And say whatever she wanted
and just not knowing...

1294
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:40,541
不知道…我想管她
not trying to keep her in tow.

1295
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,084
你这肮脏的混血
You filthy half-blood!

1296
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:44,629
没关系，他只不过是好奇宝宝
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1297
00:58:44,712 --> 00:58:46,213
我一直想说「闭嘴」
I kept wanting to go, "Shut up."

1298
00:58:46,797 --> 00:58:48,007
跩哥
Draco.

1299
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:53,262
{\an5}（大厅
霍格沃茨魔法与巫术学院）

1300
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:57,808
我杀了你，对吧？
- I killed you didn't I?
- You killed me but...

1301
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:00,311
－你杀了我，可是…
－对，对不起
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1302
00:59:00,394 --> 00:59:01,687
我得杀了你
Had to be done.

1303
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,814
我记得我们合作了
很多咒语之类的
I remember, we worked
on lots of spells and things

1304
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:06,692
你那时是很棒的巫师
我则是很棒的女巫
because you were
a really good wizard

1305
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:06,692
I was a really good witch.

1306
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,487
我们有很棒的好戏
他们砍掉了很多场戏
And we had a real duo
and they cut the whole lot.

1307
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:12,365
－我当时很不开心
－对
- Yeah.
- And I was really fessed up

1308
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,784
因为我想
「我上了魔杖学校几周」
because I just thought I've been
to one school for weeks.

1309
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:16,911
我们在那个片场待了好几天
And we were on that set for days.

1310
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:18,788
－拍好几天
－对
Days. It was in the round.

1311
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:20,665
我认为那是我最初的几场戏
- Yeah.
- I think it was really one
of my first things.

1312
00:59:20,748 --> 00:59:21,832
然后你掉进纱幕
And you fell into the Veil.
Wasn't it, the Veil?

1313
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:23,459
是纱幕吗？
- Yeah, yeah, I go through the Veil.
- Was it?

1314
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:24,669
我掉进了纱幕

1315
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:28,673
然后变得很悬疑
他回不回得来？
Then there was speculation of
does he come back?

1316
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:30,633
－对
－人能从纱幕回来吗？
- Can you come back from the Veil?
- Yeah.

1317
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,551
－不，没办法
－不行
- No, you can't.
- Yeah. No, you can't.

1318
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,970
啊哇呾喀呾啦
Avada Kedavra!

1319
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,531
我总说那时有个很有趣的一点
I've always say that there
was an interesting point

1320
00:59:53,614 --> 00:59:55,491
对我们这些年轻演员都一样
for all of us, as like,
younger actors

1321
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:58,244
因为有个团体，像是玛吉…
because there was certain group
like Maggie...

1322
00:59:58,327 --> 01:00:00,705
－对
－戴维布拉德利和艾伦
- Yeah.
- David Bradley and Alan.

1323
01:00:00,788 --> 01:00:02,790
他们从我们１０或１１岁
就认识我们
They'd known us
when we were 10 or 11.

1324
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:05,209
等你加入那时
我已经１５还１６岁了
- Yeah.
- And when you came in
- by that point I was like 15, 16.
- Yeah.

1325
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,128
－对
－所以你和盖瑞和戴维…
So, like you and Gary and David, like

1326
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,171
－对
－都把我们当大人看
- would treat us more like adults.
- Yeah.

1327
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:13,050
我很喜欢，你视我们为准备好
- I loved it.
- You saw in us that like

1328
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:12,800
a few of us were like,
kind of ready to be like

1329
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:15,761
你能推动我
我们也想试着当演员
can you push me, like,
we wanna try and be actors too.

1330
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:22,143
（成长）

1331
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,397
等我们拍「凤凰会的密令」时
By the time we get
to Order of the Phoenix

1332
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,150
世界变得越来越政治化
the world is becoming more political

1333
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,652
而我觉得我们需要一个导演
and I felt we needed a director
who could handle that

1334
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:34,238
能用有趣的方式处理
in an entertaining way.

1335
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:36,824
{\an5}戴维叶慈跟演员合作无间
David Yates works so well
with actors

1336
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:39,160
{\an5}他真的能推动演员的潜能
really pushes them in
all the right way.

1337
01:00:39,994 --> 01:00:45,916
不该鼓励为了进步而进步
Progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

1338
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,462
戴维很好、很温和
David was just such a sweet,
kind of gentle guy

1339
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,048
他很在乎这些角色
that really cared so much
about all of these characters.

1340
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,593
我们跟戴维
也有很多一对一的交流
And also, we had a lot of, kind of,
one on one with David Yates.

1341
01:00:55,676 --> 01:00:58,846
我参与「凤凰会的密令」时
想着这些年轻演员
I went into Order of the Phoenix
with the young actors in mind

1342
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:02,391
想着我们怎么让电影茁壮
and sort of thinking about
how we sort of grow

1343
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:02,391
the whole thing up

1344
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:07,813
{\an5}让电影变得更成人
更有主题性、更黑暗
and make it a little bit more adult

1345
01:01:04,685 --> 01:01:07,938
and sort of thematic
and a little darker.

1346
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:17,156
电影需要扩展更多
变得更大、更吓人
It needed to expand and get bigger
and more and more frightening.

1347
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,955
越来越具规模、越来越复杂
There was a big increase
in scale and complexity

1348
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,584
{\an5}从幼稚变成到影响人的事件
from being childish
to influencing events

1349
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:31,462
{\an5}成为大世界的一部分
and being part of the big world.

1350
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:33,672
他只是个孩子
He's just a boy.

1351
01:01:34,215 --> 01:01:36,926
再说下去，干脆让他加入凤凰会
You say much more
and you might as well induct him

1352
01:01:36,008 --> 01:01:38,052
- to the order straight away.
- Good, I want to join.

1353
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:38,052
好啊，我想加入

1354
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:40,304
佛地魔在重整军队，我要参战
If Voldemort's raising an army
then I want to fight.

1355
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:49,313
刚开始时
戴维和电影公司跟我说
When I started one thing that David

1356
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:50,981
and the studio spoke to me about
was Emma is

1357
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:54,443
就是埃玛不想回来
拍另一部「哈利波特」电影

1358
01:01:51,065 --> 01:01:54,527
not sure she wants to come back
to do another Potter.

1359
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:56,737
哈利
Harry!

1360
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:02,618
大家绝对忘了她怎么接下来
People definitely forget
what she took on

1361
01:02:02,701 --> 01:02:04,620
和她多有肚量地拍完电影
and how gracefully she did it.

1362
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:07,873
丹和鲁伯特彼此支持
Dan and Rupert, they had each other.

1363
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,709
我有我的粉丝
I had my cronies,
whereas Emma was not only younger

1364
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,628
埃玛不仅比我们年轻

1365
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,672
她还只能靠自己
she was... she was by herself.

1366
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:16,465
Emma!

1367
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,468
我找到一份日记
I did find a diary entry
that was kinda like...

1368
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:24,056
我看得出我有时候很孤独
I can see that at times I was lonely.

1369
01:02:25,391 --> 01:02:26,976
我们在电影上都没提到
We never talked about it on the film
because we were all just kids.

1370
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:28,602
因为我们那时候都还小

1371
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:32,356
身为１４岁的男孩，我不会回头
As a 14-year-old boy
I was never gonna turn around

1372
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:35,317
去跟另一个１４岁的孩子说
「你好吗？一切都好吗？」
to another 14 year old and be like,
"Hey, how you doing?"

1373
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,985
Like, "Is everything okay?"

1374
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:38,070
「凤凰会的密令」
So, Order of the Phoenix.

1375
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,948
对我们来说
那时一切开始变得很刺激
Was when things started
getting spicy for all of us.

1376
01:02:41,031 --> 01:02:42,533
但你那时候想退出？
But you were considering pulling out.

1377
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:44,160
我从没跟你谈过这件事
I never really spoken to you
about this.

1378
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:45,953
对，我认为…
Yeah. I think...
I think I was scared.

1379
01:02:46,954 --> 01:02:48,247
－我那时候很害怕
－对

1380
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,167
我不知道你有没有感觉过
自己来到了某个临界点
- Yeah.
- I don't know if...
if you ever felt like
it got to a tipping point

1381
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,668
－绝对有
－你就会开始想
- when you were like...
- Oh, absolutely.

1382
01:02:52,751 --> 01:02:54,170
「这现在变成永远的事了」
- this is kinda forever now.
- Yeah.

1383
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:57,631
对，我有遇过
从头到尾都有这种感觉
No, I had moments like that,
kind of all the way through.

1384
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,678
我也跟埃玛有一点类似的感觉
I also had kind of similar feelings
to Emma

1385
01:03:03,804 --> 01:03:07,474
有点考虑我要是弃拍
人生会怎样
kind of contemplating what life
would be like if I called it a day.

1386
01:03:07,558 --> 01:03:10,102
但我们都没谈过这事
But... we never really
spoke about it.

1387
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,063
我们大概都用自己的步调
经历这过程
I didn't... I guess we were
just kind of going through it

1388
01:03:13,147 --> 01:03:15,649
我们那时候有点身陷其中
at our own pace and we were kind of
in the moment at the time.

1389
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:17,776
我们没真正想到…
It just didn't really occur to us

1390
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,906
我们都有点大概有类似的感觉
that we were all kind of having
similar... similar feelings.

1391
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:29,663
对，名气的确大大影响了我们
Yeah, the fame thing had finally
hit home in a big way.

1392
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,460
我不用被人说服得拍完这些电影
No one had to convince me
to see it through.

1393
01:03:37,004 --> 01:03:39,340
影迷真的很想看我们成功
The fans genuinely wanted you
to succeed

1394
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,926
我们也真的都很想支持彼此
and we all genuinely have
each other's backs.

1395
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:43,969
这很棒，对吧？
How great is that?

1396
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,980
认识人总是很棒
It's always amazing meeting people.

1397
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,440
这些电影对他们意义重大
These films mean so much to them

1398
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:59,193
因为大家跟我们一起长大
because... they kind of
grew up alongside us

1399
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:02,655
这些电影帮大家
经历人生困难的事物
and helped them with some really
difficult things in their lives.

1400
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:06,033
我很骄傲能够参与
And I'm just very proud to be
a part of something

1401
01:04:06,116 --> 01:04:09,578
对很多人有重大意义的电影
that means so much to so many.

1402
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,754
我一直在想邓不利多跟我说的事
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1403
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:20,631
什么事？
What's that?

1404
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,676
我们必须面对一场战斗
That even though we've got
a fight ahead of us

1405
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,179
但是我们拥有佛地魔没有的东西
we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1406
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,265
是什么？
Yeah?

1407
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:33,060
值得我们捍卫的一切
Something worth fighting for.

1408
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:39,608
我儿子比利
我们以前每晚都看这些电影
My son, Billy, we used
to watch them every night.

1409
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:41,527
他要是遇到周日夜忧郁
You know, if you got
the Sunday night blues

1410
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,280
他就会看「哈利波特」电影
it was watching a Potter movie.

1411
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:45,656
这些电影是他的安全之处
That was his safe place.

1412
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:47,491
我很期待有一天
I'm really looking forward
to watching the films

1413
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:49,618
跟我还没出世的孩子们
看这些电影
with my hypothetical children
one day.

1414
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:51,203
这系列的影响很重大
- It's massive, the impact.
- Yeah.

1415
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,871
－很特别
－很难相信
- It is extraordinary.
- It is unbelievable.

1416
01:04:53,831 --> 01:04:56,959
（格格不入的人）

1417
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:00,170
{\an5}我从１１岁起就写信给ＪＫ罗琳
I was writing to J.K. Rowling
since I was about 11 years old

1418
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:01,380
跟她道谢
to say thank you to her, to say

1419
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:04,466
跟她说「少了有哈利波特的人生
会变得有点绝望」
I would find life a bit hopeless
without Harry Potter.

1420
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:08,387
还好她读了，也回了我的信
Luckily, for me, she read
the letter and responded to it.

1421
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:11,140
所以我算是少数幸运的人
So, I'm one of the very lucky
few people

1422
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:14,310
我可以说ＪＫ罗琳是我的笔友
who can say J.K. Rowling
was my pen friend.

1423
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:17,521
（你想拍电影吗？）

1424
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,150
试镜的第一阶段
是这场疯狂的公开试镜
The first part of the audition
is this crazy open call.

1425
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,569
真的是人人都能参加
Literally, anyone can come.

1426
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:25,237
（不用经验亦可）

1427
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,573
那就是我的门票
开始了，我们去伦敦
That's my ticket. Off we go.
Let's go to London.

1428
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:29,241
当然是用飞的啊
We fly, of course.

1429
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,078
有上千人排队
And there would be thousands
of people lining up.

1430
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,956
我很清楚记得丹
I remember Dan, very vividly.

1431
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,374
那是我的试镜
It was on my screen test.

1432
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,542
槲寄生
Mistletoe.

1433
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,377
（即兴）

1434
01:05:40,461 --> 01:05:41,962
我记得他在跟我说话
I remember him talking to me

1435
01:05:42,046 --> 01:05:43,797
我一直忘记我得回复他
and I kept forgetting that
I have to talk back to him

1436
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:45,883
因为我很习惯看他在屏幕上
because I'm so used
to watching him on a screen.

1437
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,093
所以我就有点…
So I would just kind of be like...

1438
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:52,639
我认为这促成了
露娜罗古德的个性
And I kind of think that contributed
to the whole Luna Lovegood vibe.

1439
01:05:52,723 --> 01:05:54,391
因为她有点恍惚
Because she is a bit spacey.

1440
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:56,894
哈啰，各位
Hello, everyone.

1441
01:05:58,479 --> 01:05:59,646
你看起来很可怕，荣恩
You look dreadful, Ron.

1442
01:06:00,481 --> 01:06:05,235
然后他发现
这个怪胎异类的秘密世界
And then he found this
secret world of odd bods

1443
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:07,446
这些人拥有奇怪的力量
of misfits, of people
who had this strange power

1444
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:11,784
但他们还是有强烈的人性
深度、也很脆弱
but who still had enormous humanity
and depth and vulnerability.

1445
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:15,454
这些电影让大家
接受自己的这个部分
The movies kinda
gave people permission

1446
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:15,287
to accept parts of themselves.

1447
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:18,540
所以看到自己古怪的面向
So, it was quite liberating to see
your oddness as a superpower

1448
01:06:18,624 --> 01:06:21,168
在屏幕上有超能力
感觉让人很自由

1449
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:21,752
represented on screen.

1450
01:06:21,835 --> 01:06:23,796
我记得我第一次看到你们大家
I remember when I first met you all

1451
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:26,715
这是我见过最大群的异类
biggest bunch of misfits
have I ever set eyes on.

1452
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,592
然后我们都在这里
And here we all are.

1453
01:06:28,675 --> 01:06:30,052
我们还是一大群异类
We're still a bunch of misfits.

1454
01:06:30,135 --> 01:06:32,971
也许，可是我们拥有彼此
Well, maybe
but we've all got each other.

1455
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:35,224
我那时对课业不在行
I was not good at school.

1456
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:37,476
你最好读「高沙的药草指南」
You'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1457
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:39,186
我朋友不多
I didn't have
a huge amount of friends.

1458
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:41,980
注意你的脚步，隆巴顿
Which way you going, Longbottom?

1459
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:45,734
我认为当异类很棒
I think it's great to be a misfit

1460
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:47,945
{\an5}我认为那就是
这系列受欢迎的原因
and I think that's possibly why
it's so popular.

1461
01:06:48,028 --> 01:06:50,948
{\an5}大家都想知道自己不会格格不入
Everyone wants to know
that they do belong.

1462
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:53,492
我认为这很能舒缓孤独的感觉
It's a great relief of loneliness,
I think.

1463
01:06:53,575 --> 01:06:54,993
我小时候很害羞
I was quite a shy kid.

1464
01:06:55,077 --> 01:07:00,707
我能体会那种格格不入的感觉
I could relate to that
kind of feeling of

1465
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,707
not quite knowing what your place is.

1466
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:02,835
努力工作是很重要
Working hard is important.

1467
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,461
但有另一件事更重要
But there's something
that matters even more

1468
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:06,713
－咄咄失
－相信自己
- Stupefy!
- believing in yourself.

1469
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:12,344
大家见证这些
格格不入的角色之后
Everyone felt more like they belonged

1470
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,055
都觉得自己更有归属感
by witnessing these characters
that didn't belong.

1471
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:18,600
（当哈利遇上金妮）

1472
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:23,856
邦妮在刚来时，她大概才九岁
Bonnie, was kinda when she arrived,
she was only... 9, maybe.

1473
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:25,190
妈咪，你有看到我的毛衣吗？
Mommy, have you seen my jumper?

1474
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,859
有，亲爱的，猫穿走了
Yes, dear. It was on the cat.

1475
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:29,069
哈啰
Hello.

1476
01:07:29,153 --> 01:07:35,325
我总认为金妮和哈利的关系
有点慢慢发展
I always found Ginny-Harry,
that relationship

1477
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:35,075
how that kind of slowly developed

1478
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:39,496
并和韦斯利一家纠结在一起
and entangling with it
the whole Weasley family

1479
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,666
哈利基本上
也成了韦斯利家族一员
and Harry essentially
becoming a Weasley himself.

1480
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,502
我从没预期过这种事
It was something I never really
kind of expected

1481
01:07:45,586 --> 01:07:46,920
尤其是读原著的时候
especially kind of reading the books.

1482
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:48,881
邦妮年纪最小
Bonnie was the youngest one.

1483
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,300
所以感觉有点怪
So it was just a bit like oh, what?
This is weird.

1484
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,677
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

1485
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:56,346
有一种压力
And you know,
there is kind of pressure.

1486
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,017
{\an5}这是很受钟爱的故事主角
You know, this is the loved,
sort of, hero of the story.

1487
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,312
片场的人都认识你六、七年了
So, everyone on the set has known you
for about six or seven years

1488
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:04,605
他们都看着你长大
and they watch you grow up.

1489
01:08:04,688 --> 01:08:06,982
然后他们要看你接吻
And they're now gonna just
watch you kiss. Cool, yeah?

1490
01:08:07,065 --> 01:08:08,275
很酷吧

1491
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:19,119
ＪＫ罗琳写了很多出色的女性角色
I mean, there's so many amazing
female roles that Jo wrote

1492
01:08:19,203 --> 01:08:20,579
我认为这很重要
and I... I think
that's really important.

1493
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:26,168
我很替邦妮骄傲
还有伊凡娜和凯蒂
I'm so proud of who Bonnie
and Evanna and Katie are

1494
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:27,920
和她们后来变成怎样的人
and who they've become.

1495
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:31,131
她们都成为很厉害的活动家
They've all become
these incredible activists.

1496
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:36,470
每一个女孩子
都是很可爱很棒的人
Every single one of those girls
was like a lovely, great human being.

1497
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:41,683
{\an5}（史莱哲林交谊厅
霍格沃茨魔法与巫术学院）

1498
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,769
我很想念你的陪伴
I tell you I've...
I've missed your company.

1499
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:45,812
－是吗？谢谢
－这是真的
- Did you? Aw, thank you.
- That's for sure.

1500
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:47,898
你有拿什么东西吗？
因为我偷了很多东西
Did you get anything?
Because I stole quite a lot.

1501
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:49,107
－真的吗？
－对
- Did you really?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,859
－看吧，我没学到这点
－我早该告诉你的
No, I didn't.
I should've learned that.

1503
01:08:50,943 --> 01:08:52,069
这样让我感觉很安心
- I should've told you.
- Oh, and I'm quite reassured by that

1504
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:54,988
因为我绝对想偷我的魔杖
because I was definitely trying
to steal my wand.

1505
01:08:55,072 --> 01:08:58,158
我很担心我要是偷了
我大概就会把魔杖丢在哪里
- Yeah.
- And I worry that if I had

1506
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:58,158
I probably would've lost it
by now somewhere.

1507
01:08:58,242 --> 01:08:59,785
你知道魔杖没有用吧，汤姆？
You know, they don't work, Tom.

1508
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:05,165
有人跟我说只要花时间练习…
Well, I've been assured that...

1509
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:05,874
In time, with enough practice...
Practice, it would work.

1510
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:06,542
－就会有用
－对

1511
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:08,502
但现在回首很好笑
Yes. But it's quite funny
looking back at it now.

1512
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:12,047
我们做这些手势
但却什么都没有
Also doing these incredibly elaborate
moves and nothing happening.

1513
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,758
什么都没有，我只有一次有结果
And nothing happening. Except
one time it did happen with me.

1514
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:18,136
他们说「我们这次
要炸掉海格的房子」
And they said, "Okay, this time
we are gonna blow up Hagrid's...

1515
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,888
对，你有拍那幕
Oh yeah, you got to do it,
didn't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1516
01:09:19,972 --> 01:09:22,015
他们说「我们让你下指令」
And they said, "So, we will take
your queue."

1517
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,268
「你施展咒语时
房子就会爆炸」
- Yeah.
- "When you do your spell

1518
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,560
it will blow up.

1519
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,189
我对自己的反应非常惊讶
And I was so actually
really surprised

1520
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:32,359
也很害怕，因为我想「天啊」
and scared by my own reaction
because I thought, wow.

1521
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:38,865
－那种力量的快感真可怕
－对
It was this horrible thrill of power.

1522
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:41,201
－你会想，我有那种想法…
－对
- Right.
- Being like, I've had that...

1523
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:43,996
用我的魔杖指东西就会爆炸
- Yeah, sure.
- Just pointing my wand there.

1524
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:44,371
- And then, boom. Yeah.
- And then it blew up.

1525
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,624
对，比让羽毛漂浮更好玩
It's a lot more satisfying than,
you know, making a feather levitate.

1526
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,042
对
Yeah.

1527
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:54,339
跩哥用那个怪柜子做什么？
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird looking cabinet

1528
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,049
这些人又是谁？
and who were all those people?

1529
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:58,135
你们看不出来吗？这是一场仪式
Don't you see, it was a ceremony,
an initiation.

1530
01:09:58,218 --> 01:09:59,511
入会仪式

1531
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,722
别闹了，哈利
我知道你想说什么
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going with this.

1532
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:04,057
这是真的，他是他们的一份子
It's happened.
He's one of them.

1533
01:10:04,141 --> 01:10:05,309
他们的成员？
One of what?

1534
01:10:06,685 --> 01:10:09,938
哈利认为跩哥马份
现在成了食死人
Harry's under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

1535
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:14,276
（跩哥）

1536
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:16,111
这个孩子没受过关爱
The child
who wasn't received affection

1537
01:10:16,194 --> 01:10:19,156
没有父母或成人
给予你成长过程需要的关爱
the enabling love of the parent
or the adult

1538
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:22,034
{\an5}可能发展出愤怒
或对世界感到憎恨
can develop this anger
and hatred of the world

1539
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,910
然后进入黑暗面
and goes to the dark side.

1540
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:27,247
－你敢在我家对我这样说话？
－鲁休思
You dare to talk to me like that

1541
01:10:25,746 --> 01:10:27,080
- in my own house.
- Lucius.

1542
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:30,042
跩哥大部分的人生
So much of what Draco's journey is
is to do with whether he is

1543
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,628
取决于他是否想取悦父亲
or isn't trying to please his father.

1544
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:35,797
在第六部电影里
他们让他做了最糟的事
In the sixth film they make him do
the worst thing ever

1545
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:38,342
杀害邓不利多
or attempt the worst thing ever
of killing Dumbledore

1546
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:40,469
我们看到他崩溃
and obviously we see him crumble.

1547
01:10:40,552 --> 01:10:44,514
跩哥，好几年前
我认识一个男孩
Draco, years ago a new a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1548
01:10:44,598 --> 01:10:47,225
他做出所有错误的决定

1549
01:10:48,935 --> 01:10:51,438
－请让我帮你
－我不要你帮忙
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help.

1550
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:54,608
你不懂吗？
Don't you understand.

1551
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:56,109
我必须这样做
I have to do this.

1552
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:58,737
我得杀了你
I have to kill you
or he's gonna kill me.

1553
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:01,156
不然他就会杀了我

1554
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:03,450
汤姆在「混血王子的背叛」里
最棒的一点是
With Tom what was great
with Half-Blood Prince

1555
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:10,248
这个坏人在前几部电影里很普通
was you suddenly took this bad guy

1556
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:09,998
who in the previous films had always
been somewhat two dimensional

1557
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:17,172
然后我们可以给他机会探索
更复杂有趣的旅程
and then we were able to give him
the opportunity

1558
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:17,047
to explore a far more complex
and interesting journey.

1559
01:11:17,255 --> 01:11:18,548
我跟他坐下，我说
And I sat down with him

1560
01:11:18,632 --> 01:11:22,010
「汤姆，这是你
发光发亮的好机会」
and I said, "Tom, look, this is your
opportunity to really shine."

1561
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:24,429
我记得戴维叶慈说
I remember David Yates

1562
01:11:23,387 --> 01:11:27,516
uh, saying, "If we can get
just one percent of empathy

1563
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:28,725
「你要是能对他
有百分之一的同情」

1564
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:29,935
or sympathy for him
that we'll have done our job."

1565
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:30,394
「那我们就成功了」

1566
01:11:30,477 --> 01:11:31,687
下手
Do it.

1567
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:34,314
对我而言，跩哥是主角
To my mind, Draco is the hero.

1568
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:35,941
哈利总是要做正确的事
Harry's always going to do
the right thing.

1569
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:37,150
哈利总想做对选择
Harry's always gonna make
the right choice.

1570
01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:39,111
他从来没有遇过困境
There's never really any dilemma
for him.

1571
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:42,739
跩哥则打破了他糟糕家庭的枷锁
Draco breaks the chains
of his terrible family

1572
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:45,117
打破他的责任
和他该做的事这些枷锁
and of his responsibility
and what he's expected to do.

1573
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,618
看着汤姆
And to watch Tom
create that struggle on screen

1574
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:51,748
在屏幕上创造出那种挣扎
演出这些细微的差别

1575
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:52,499
and really manifest all that nuance,
all that complication

1576
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:54,376
这些复杂的事
这些很强烈的道德地雷区
all that great ethical minefield
that he tiptoes through

1577
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:57,254
他小心翼翼穿越这个地雷区
很令人佩服

1578
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:57,254
it was... it was just so impressive.

1579
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,381
不
No.

1580
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,644
赛佛勒斯
Severus.

1581
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,238
拜托
Please.

1582
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:25,574
啊哇呾喀呾啦
Avada Kedavra.

1583
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:38,754
能回来当然很棒
It's obviously amazing to be back
but I... It's like...

1584
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:43,675
但是可以说很惊吓

1585
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:46,011
It's so, I guess, like shocking that
so many people that we both thought

1586
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:47,471
很多我们以为会活更久的人

1587
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:47,554
would be around for much longer

1588
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:50,974
然后他们就走了
than they have been like Helen
and Alan and Richard and...

1589
01:12:51,057 --> 01:12:54,436
海伦、艾伦、理查德和…

1590
01:12:54,519 --> 01:12:57,606
对，他们跟家人一样
Yeah. They're like fa... like family.
You can grieve in the same way.

1591
01:12:57,689 --> 01:12:59,983
－我们都很舍不得
－对

1592
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:01,985
- Yeah.
- Just too soon.

1593
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:01,985
一切发生得太快了

1594
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:03,195
对
Yeah.

1595
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:15,582
别可怜死者，哈利
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

1596
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:18,293
可怜生者
Pity the living.

1597
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:23,465
最重要的是，可怜没有爱的生者
And above all,
all those who live without love.

1598
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:32,265
沉迷于梦中没有用，哈利
It does not do to dwell on dreams,
Harry, and forget to live.

1599
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,601
或是忘了活下去

1600
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,104
{\an5}（理查德哈里斯
生于１９３０年，卒于２００２年）

1601
01:13:38,188 --> 01:13:43,068
{\an5}理查德哈里斯是很特别温暖的人
Richard Harris was such a special,
warm person.

1602
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:46,363
他真是个闪耀的人
He was so twinkly.

1603
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:52,661
理查德很经典
他大概是我认识最搞笑的人
Oh, Richard was classic.

1604
01:13:49,866 --> 01:13:52,702
Probably one of the funniest men
I ever met.

1605
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:57,707
他是个１１岁的小恶魔
被困在７０多岁男子的身体里
He was this devilish 11-year-old

1606
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:57,707
trapped in a 70 plus year old
man's body.

1607
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,210
你可以再替我们转一圈吗？
Will you give us another twirl,
please?

1608
01:14:02,128 --> 01:14:03,588
他眼里有一抹光芒
He just had that glint in his eye

1609
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,632
让他成为完美的邓不利多
which made him the perfect
Dumbledore, by the way.

1610
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:07,300
他非常搞笑
He was brutally hilarious.

是很棒的德思礼先生
Richard Griffiths was just delicious
as, uh, Mr. Dursley.

1613
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:18,728
{\an5}世界上没有魔法
There's no such thing as magic.

1614
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:25,318
他用气魄和热情拥抱他的邪恶
He embraced his wickedness
with such verve and passion.

1615
01:14:25,402 --> 01:14:28,113

His passing was the one
that has affected me most

1616
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:29,656
因为他很乐于分享知识
because he was generous
with knowledge.

1617
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:31,950
他说「我想跟你分享一切」
He just, like, wanted to share
everything with you.

1618
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:38,373

生于１９４０年，卒于２０１７年）

波特先生
I wondered when I'd be seeing you,
Mr. Potter.

1620
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:47,549

with amount of just amazing people
that have passed.

1622
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:54,055

You know,
I'll be very, very old one day

1623

「我认识那个传奇人物」

海伦麦柯瑞饰演我的妻子
Helen McCrory played my wife.

I said, "I think I just met the best
actress I've ever seen in my life."

1629
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:11,698

and shared just so much

1632
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,747
frankly, adolescent laughter with her
on the set.

1633
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:22,834
她教了我很多
She had taught me a lot.

1634
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:24,878
看吧，我连话都说不出来
See, I can't even say it.

1635
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:32,427
她有种能力可以…
She had this ability, yeah,
just to sort of, to show such empathy

1636
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:36,640
用双眼展现同情

1637
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:37,265
in her eyes.

1638
01:15:37,557 --> 01:15:39,392
跟她合作真的很享受

Alan Rickman never talked to me
like I was a child.

1641

He always took my thoughts
and opinions very seriously

1642
01:15:58,745 --> 01:16:01,331

我那时有点怕他
I was a little intimidated by him,
his precision

他念台词的精准专业度

1651

his expert delivery of lines and...

1652

了解伴随而来的责任

{\an5}看到我们小时候的布景

1684
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,642
like, kids on, who treated everything

1685
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,852
跟儿时看到时的态度完全一样
with the amount of respect kids
treat things

1686
01:19:08,935 --> 01:19:11,187
我们在现场玩得很开心

1687
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:11,146
when you're just there
and having fun.

1688
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:13,273
真的，我感受到一股
诡异的怀旧感
It's weird. I'm having like, weird,
nostalgic moments.

1689
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:15,441
记得我的仓鼠吗？
有人记得我的仓鼠吗？
Do you remember my hamster?
Does anyone remember my hamster.

1690
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:16,568
－记得
－米莉
- Yes.
- Millie.

1691
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,902
我不记得仓鼠的名字，抱歉
Yeah. I didn't remember
the hamster's name, sorry.

1692
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,195
－对
－没关系
That's okay. That's okay.
Rest in peace, Millie.

1693
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:20,572
没关系，安息吧，米莉

1694
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,115
我记得你有一只仓鼠
I remember you having a hamster
and being greatly jealous

1695
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:25,201
我对你在片场有宠物
隐约有点忌妒

1696
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,201
that you had an animal
that was on set with you.

1697
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:27,704
木工部门替仓鼠
做了棺材，对不对？
They made a coffin for it.

1698
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:27,537
- They did, yeah.
- The carpentry department.

1699
01:19:27,787 --> 01:19:31,166
米莉死掉时，布景设计替米莉
- Did they? Jesus.
- When Millie died the set designers

1700
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:33,793
built Millie her own custom made
wooden coffin

1701
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:33,793
建造了她客制的木棺材

1702
01:19:33,877 --> 01:19:36,421
－里面有天鹅绒
－很漂亮
- that had velvet on the inside of it.
- It was beautiful.

1703
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:41,759
还有刻牠的名字
因为我当时很难过
And, and it had her name engraved.

1704
01:19:38,798 --> 01:19:39,966
- I mean...
- Because I was...

1705
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:41,759
I mean, I was beside myself.

1706
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,845
我们有办葬礼吗？
我觉得我们有致词过
Did we do like, a service?
I feel like we said a few words.

1707
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:47,098
我一直想抱起死掉的米莉
I kept wanting to pick up dead
Millie.

1708
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,684
抚摸死掉的米莉
And like, stroke and touch dead
Millie.

1709
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:54,731
他说
「埃玛，米莉得待在棺材里」
And he was like, "Emma, Millie's
gotta stay in the coffin now."

1710
01:19:54,814 --> 01:19:57,192
我都忘了这些事情
I have forgotten so much of this.

1711
01:19:57,275 --> 01:19:59,944
感觉这是没多久以前的事
It doesn't feel like much time
has passed.

1712
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,237
我知道
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

1713
01:20:01,321 --> 01:20:02,989
我们现在看起来
还是比电影尾声好
We all still look better than we do
in the epilogue, which is great.

1714
01:20:03,072 --> 01:20:04,157
－这样很好
－对

1715
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,575
－像我们在那之前办到的
－这样很怪
- Which is a win.
- Like, we've made it in before that.

1716
01:20:08,661 --> 01:20:10,246
－袋子呢？
－有带
- Bag?
- Yeah.

1717
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,956
毛衣呢？
Jumper.

1718
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,666
我那时额头超高
- Yeah.
- I was all forehead.

1719
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,210
还穿了肥胖装
- And the fat suit.
- Yeah.

1720
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:18,046
－对，我很…
－我认为我那时有点…
- I was very... I was... I was...
- I think I kind of...

1721
01:20:18,129 --> 01:20:20,423
你超尽力拍的，你就…
Yeah. You went for it.

1722
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,798
You were like, "Give me the full...

1723
01:20:20,506 --> 01:20:22,050
－给我…
－没错，我超尽力拍的
- Give me the suit."
- He went all in.

1724
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:23,468
－对，你那时全力以赴
－对
- Yeah.
- I was so proud of you.

1725
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:24,886
我好替你骄傲

1726
01:20:27,138 --> 01:20:29,265
没人能真正了解
No one else can really quite
understand what we experienced.

1727
01:20:29,349 --> 01:20:31,601
我们的体验非常独特
It was a very unique thing.

1728
01:20:31,684 --> 01:20:34,520
戴维叶慈以前说我们是航天员
I think David Yates
used to describe us as astronauts

1729
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:38,775
因为没有别人经历过
这种拍摄规模
because no one else has really
experienced this on this scale

1730
01:20:38,858 --> 01:20:41,277
我们会因此永远联系在一起
and we'll be kind of forever bonded
by that.

1731
01:20:46,574 --> 01:20:48,368
我对我们三个最甜蜜的回忆
Some of the sweetest memories I have
from the three of us

1732
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:50,954
就是我们都知道，我们必须…
is just each of us knowing we sort of
needed to take care of each other

1733
01:20:51,037 --> 01:20:53,414
用细微的方式照顾彼此

1734
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:53,665
in just small ways.

1735
01:20:53,498 --> 01:20:57,210
比如说「天气很冷
我们都要…」
Just in terms of like,
it's really cold.

1736
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:58,503
Like, we're all gonna st...
We're all gonna stand together.

1737
01:20:57,293 --> 01:20:58,670
「我们要站在一起」

1738
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,421
或者「我累了」
Or, "I'm knackered.

1739
01:21:00,505 --> 01:21:03,383
「丹，我可以靠你身上睡吗？」
Are you okay, Dan,
if I like, fall asleep on you

1740
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:06,970
在这两个镜头之间
因为我太累或…
like, in between this take
because I'm so tired?" Or...

1741
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:11,015
我认为我们都在各种状况下
靠在彼此身上睡着过
I think we have all fallen asleep
in various

1742
01:21:09,555 --> 01:21:12,642
like, on, on each other in, like,
some of the most grand cathedrals

1743
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,518
在英国几座最宏伟的大教堂里

1744
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:14,310
and things in the UK.

1745
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:17,605
我的信任程度…
The level of trust that I had

1746
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:20,275
我们这十年建立的信任
and that we did build
over those 10 years

1747
01:21:20,358 --> 01:21:23,194
我们要是做特技
was like, if we were doing a stunt

1748
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,029
I trusted that one of you
would catch me.

1749
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,029
我信任你们会接住我

1750
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,240
我认为这种信任和依靠
I feel like that kind of trust
and reliance

1751
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:28,908
这需要…
and that takes... You know,
there's very few work environments

1752
01:21:28,992 --> 01:21:32,078
很少有工作环境
可以让人建立这种信任程度

1753
01:21:30,576 --> 01:21:31,786
where you get that much time
to build that up.

1754
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,454
而且这些事都不用说出口
And it was like, nonverbal.

1755
01:21:33,538 --> 01:21:37,875
我们三个好像不用说话就能沟通
Like, it was all...
It was like the three of us

1756
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,875
could communicate
without even having to say anything.

1757
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:39,419
我们就是知道该做的就要做
We just knew what needed to be done.

1758
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:42,964
我们替彼此保持坚强
We were each very strong
for each other.

1759
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:45,800
我们得换衣服
I need to change.

1760
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:53,641
怎么…
How the ruddy?

1761
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:55,560
无形伸展咒
Undetectable extension charm.

1762
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,396
你真厉害，真的
You're amazing. You are.

1763
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,441
你总是那么惊讶
Always the tone of surprise.

1764
01:22:01,524 --> 01:22:03,985
这几部电影的氛围很不一样
These films
had a very different feel.

1765
01:22:04,068 --> 01:22:06,404
我们常常不在霍格沃茨
We were away from Hogwarts
a lot of the time

1766
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:08,364
我们会在不同的地方过夜
camping out in different places.

1767
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:12,243
气氛黑暗多了
感觉像不同的电影
Tone was a lot darker,
and it felt like a different film.

1768
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,412
邓不利多派你去找这些分灵体
Dumbledore sends you off
to find all these Horcruxes

1769
01:22:14,495 --> 01:22:16,164
但他没叫你摧毁它们
but doesn't tell you
how to destroy them?

1770
01:22:16,247 --> 01:22:18,791
我认为感觉很不一样
It was very refreshing

1771
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,169
I think, because we all got to do
some a lot more serious stuff

1772
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,294
因为我们都能拍更严肃的主题

1773
01:22:21,377 --> 01:22:24,547
有机会更深入
这些角色现实的一面
and it was a real opportunity
to go deeper with these characters.

1774
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,257
你是要来，还是要留下来？
Are you coming, are you staying?

1775
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,472
我那天晚上看到你们两个
I saw you two the other night.

1776
01:22:33,389 --> 01:22:35,308
荣恩，那…没什么
Ron, that's, that's nothing.

1777
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,145
荣恩
Ron.

1778
01:22:40,104 --> 01:22:42,273
我以为会很尴尬的那一幕
The scene that I thought
was gonna be really awkward

1779
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:43,858
我对那一幕很不确定
and I wasn't sure about at all,
which was us doing our dance.

1780
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:45,860
那就是我们跳舞那一幕

1781
01:22:45,943 --> 01:22:47,320
－我就…
－对
- Like, I...
- Yeah.

1782
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:51,115
现在那算我
在整个系列最爱的一幕
Now, that's one of my favorite scenes
from the whole of the series.

1783
01:22:51,574 --> 01:22:55,661
因为我们在那时候
彼此熟悉的程度
Because the level of familiarity

1784
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:55,411
that you and I had with each other
at that point

1785
01:22:55,745 --> 01:22:58,289
我应该没办法
跟另一个演员那样演
I don't think I could've done a scene
like that with another actor.

1786
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,916
那一幕很有趣的另一个原因
Well, it's also an interesting scene

1787
01:22:59,999 --> 01:23:01,584
因为首先
我们拍的是「哈利波特」
because first of all,
we were doing Harry Potter films

1788
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:03,753
然后在最后一部电影
导演过来说
and then on the last movie,
the director came in

1789
01:23:03,836 --> 01:23:06,714
「你们听尼克凯夫的音乐
跳慢舞怎样？」
and was like, "Hey, how about you do
slow dancing

1790
01:23:05,129 --> 01:23:06,714
to Nick Cave for five minutes?"

1791
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:08,716
－你说「我们在拍什么电影？」
－我们说「什么？」
- Wait, what?
- "Wait, what movie are we working on?

1792
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,218
「好吧」
Like, great, but okay."

1793
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:37,537
那一幕描述了很多
不言而喻，我很爱那一幕
There's so much unsaid in the scene
that was unspoken.

1794
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,955
I loved that.
And also, in the same way

1795
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:41,374
同时，这些角色
得以享受片刻的乐趣

1796
01:23:39,038 --> 01:23:41,165
that for the characters,
they got to have a moment of fun

1797
01:23:41,457 --> 01:23:43,084
我认为你和我享受了片刻的乐趣
I feel like you and I
got to have a moment of fun.

1798
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:45,086
－对
－我们也…
- Yeah. Certainly.
- Which we also...

1799
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:47,338
－在那时候需要乐趣
－对，没错
Needed at that point.
Yes. Absolutely.

1800
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:49,549
那个奸诈的小混账
Treacherous little bleeder.

1801
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,008
我们谁都不能信任吗？
Is there no one we can trust?

1802
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:54,679
最后一部电影
有一段是我们跑步穿越树林
There was that like,
that sequence in the last movie

1803
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,637
where it was like,
us running through the forest.

1804
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:57,849
我们跑越树林
不想被死拿钱抓住
We were racing through the woods

1805
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:57,723
trying not to be caught
by the snatchers.

1806
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:59,142
开拍
And action.

1807
01:24:01,018 --> 01:24:02,311
别呆站着
Well, don't hang about.

1808
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:03,813
抓住他们
Snatch them.

1809
01:24:03,896 --> 01:24:05,648
老实说，我记得你和我…
Honestly, I remember
you and I, Emma

1810
01:24:05,731 --> 01:24:07,400
埃玛变得很想赢
- becoming incredibly competitive...
- Ridiculously competitive, yeah.

1811
01:24:07,483 --> 01:24:10,111
－超想赢的
－看谁跑得比较快
...about who was gonna run faster.

1812
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,197
- High five. That rocked.
- And cut.

1813
01:24:13,406 --> 01:24:15,032
我觉得鲁伯特总是有点…
I feel like Rupert was always like,
a little bit too...

1814
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:17,910
－「你们想做什么就做吧」
－他总是「你们想做就做」
- Whatever.
- ..."You guys do what you like."
Rupert's just like,
"You do your thing."

1815
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:20,455
对，对我而言，跑步就是特技
- Yeah. For me, running is a stunt.
- I'll be here.

1816
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:22,707
走路是…
Walking is a stunt.

1817
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:28,546
Harry.

1818
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:32,425
我很不喜欢看我自己演的戏
I absolutely do not like watching

1819
01:24:31,257 --> 01:24:32,467
very many scenes
with myself in there

1820
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:34,427
但我看了你们两个
我觉得你们很棒
but I've watched you two,
and I think you're brilliant.

1821
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:36,345
我觉得那很棒
I remember
that was a really sweet thing though.

1822
01:24:36,429 --> 01:24:38,931
我记得我们三个告诉彼此
I do actually remember
the three of us telling each other

1823
01:24:39,015 --> 01:24:41,350
说我们演得很好
或说我们哪一幕演得很好
that we were doing a good job,
or that we'd done a scene well.

1824
01:24:41,434 --> 01:24:43,102
尤其因为我们那么小就开始演
Especially because
we had started off young

1825
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:44,562
我们不清楚自己在做什么
and really not known
what we were doing.

1826
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:47,398
我们看到彼此演得很用力
你就会说…
So that when we would see each other
do like, a bit of real acting

1827
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,317
－「做得好」
－「那很酷」
- you'd go, "Oh, cool."
- Oh, that was right.
That was cool. That was really good.

1828
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,194
像是「我们大概越演越厉害」
- Yeah. Crushed it.
- I guess we're all getting better.

1829
01:24:51,277 --> 01:24:52,862
－「演得好」
－「做得好」
- Yeah, great. Well done.
- Right.

1830
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:55,615
当然了，我们接吻的戏
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean, obviously us kissing

1831
01:24:55,990 --> 01:25:01,996
那是我们之间做过最可怕的事
- Oh, yeah.
- was the most horrifying thing

1832
01:24:58,534 --> 01:24:59,702
either of us

1833
01:24:59,785 --> 01:25:02,079
- Yeah.
- have ever had to go through.

1834
01:25:03,623 --> 01:25:06,834
（预期）

1835
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:08,503
我是妙丽格兰杰
I'm Hermione Granger. And you are?

1836
01:25:08,586 --> 01:25:10,379
你是…

1837
01:25:11,255 --> 01:25:13,674
－我是荣恩韦斯利
－幸会
- Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

1838
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:18,304
「是啦唯啊萨，不是啦唯喔萨」
It's Leviosa, not Leviosa.

1839
01:25:18,387 --> 01:25:22,683
她真讨厌，难怪她没有朋友
She's a nightmare. Honestly.

1840
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:22,683
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

1841
01:25:24,644 --> 01:25:25,853
她听到你说的话了
I think she heard you.

1842
01:25:25,937 --> 01:25:28,314
整个系列越累积越多…
It was just built up so much
for the whole series.

1843
01:25:28,397 --> 01:25:29,482
－八部电影
－对
The eight films.

1844
01:25:29,565 --> 01:25:31,442
{\an5}我很爱荣恩和妙丽的爱情
I love Ron and Hermione's romance

1845
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:35,613
不停在故事底下酝酿
and the way that sort of just bubbles
away under the story constantly.

1846
01:25:42,912 --> 01:25:46,374
他们的关系压抑了这么久
This relationship has been
so restrained for so long.

1847
01:25:46,457 --> 01:25:48,292
一点牙膏
Got a bit of toothpaste.

1848
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:51,963
史拉轰要办圣诞派对
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

1849
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,423
我们要携伴去参加
And we're meant to bring someone.

1850
01:25:54,507 --> 01:25:55,841
你大概会带麦拉去
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.

1851
01:25:55,925 --> 01:25:59,345
观众很想看他们接吻
The audience

1852
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,303
are desperate to see these two kiss.

1853
01:25:59,428 --> 01:26:02,056
－事实上，我想邀你
－真的吗？
Actually, I was going to ask you.

1854
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,223
Really?

1855
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,350
我们本周稍后要拍一幕
There's a scene
that we shoot next this week

1856
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:06,143
等你们读过之后，我们该谈谈
that we should talk about
once you've read it

1857
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,312
因为这个礼拜
荣恩和妙丽要接吻
because we'll be doing the kiss
this week between Ron and Hermione.

1858
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,690
－什么？
－荣恩和妙丽要接吻
- What?
- Doing the kiss between

1859
01:26:10,773 --> 01:26:12,984
－这个礼拜？
－在密室里
- Ron and Hermione this week
- This week?
- This week?
- in the Chamber of Secrets.

1860
01:26:14,026 --> 01:26:16,821
在这异常危险的时刻
In this moment
of extraordinary jeopardy

1861
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:19,991
他们转向彼此，然后他们接吻了
they turn to each other,
and then they just kiss.

1862
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:26,163
我们等了七部电影才等到这一幕
We've waited seven movies for this.

1863
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,790
我跟他们在个别的拖车里谈过
I spoke to both of them
in their trailers.

1864
01:26:28,332 --> 01:26:30,626
确保他们都可以接受
Made sure they were both comfortable.

1865
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:33,337
那很像替他们准备
参与大型运动赛事
It was almost like prepping them
for a major sport event.

1866
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:37,925
「你们可以的，这会很棒的」
You know, saying,
"Okay, guys, you can do this.

1867
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:37,592
It's gonna be great."

1868
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:40,928
那场吻戏应该是
很戏剧性的一个吻
It was meant to be, like, this,
like, dramatic make out

1869
01:26:41,012 --> 01:26:43,889
因为我们很尴尬，一直笑
because you and I just kept corpsing.

1870
01:26:42,471 --> 01:26:43,848
Like, we just kept laughing.

1871
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:45,182
－对
－我很怕
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I was just really scared

1872
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,977
我们一直拍不好
因为我们很不正经
we were never gonna get it because

1873
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:47,560
- We couldn't take it seriously.
- we just couldn't take it seriously.

1874
01:26:49,395 --> 01:26:52,481
我并没有帮忙，因为他们跟我说
I did not make this better
because I've been told significantly

1875
01:26:52,565 --> 01:26:54,692
我在这场戏像个混账一样
that I was just being
an absolute dick about this

1876
01:26:54,775 --> 01:26:57,361
我想「我要来现场看你们接吻」
and was like, "I'm gonna come on set
and watch you guys kiss."

1877
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:00,364
大家都想来现场，因为大家都说
- And like...
- Well, everyone wanted to be on set

1878
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,699
because everyone was like,
"This is gonna be good, guys."

1879
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:01,657
「这会很精彩的，各位」

1880
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:03,743
－像我们得…
－很抱歉，两位
- Like, we need...
- I'm sorry about that, guys.

1881
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:08,080
我知道我会是让接吻戏成功的人
- Yeah, yeah.
- I knew I was gonna kind of have

1882
01:27:06,078 --> 01:27:07,872
to be the one to kind
of make this thing happen

1883
01:27:08,164 --> 01:27:09,999
因为鲁伯特不会…
because Rupert was not gonna.

1884
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:12,043
所以我得放手去做
So I just had to go for it.

1885
01:27:12,418 --> 01:27:13,836
不择手段
Taking no prisoners.

1886
01:27:13,919 --> 01:27:17,173
我需要有动力接吻才办得到
I needed, like, momentum
into the kiss in order to do it.

1887
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,758
而鲁伯特…
And Rupert's, I could...
Almost on that first take

1888
01:27:18,841 --> 01:27:22,345
我差点…第一次拍时
我看到鲁伯特的脸

1889
01:27:20,509 --> 01:27:24,221
I saw Rupert's face
explode with surprise

1890
01:27:22,428 --> 01:27:26,223
非常惊讶，因为那才是第一次拍

1891
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:26,223
because he thought,
it's only the first take.

1892
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,808
我那时好像有点快昏倒了
Kind of think I blacked out.

1893
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:30,728
我只记得你的脸越来越靠近
- You blacked out.
- I just remember your face

1894
01:27:28,934 --> 01:27:30,353
getting closer and closer to my...

1895
01:27:31,354 --> 01:27:35,941
你每次提到这幕
都说得好像是恐怖回忆
Every time you talk about this

1896
01:27:32,855 --> 01:27:35,608
you make it sound like an
actual horror show in your head.

1897
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:38,444
并没那么糟，我知道
- No, but it wasn't that bad. I know.
- Which is...

1898
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:54,251
亲鲁伯特是我做过
最困难的事之一
Kissing Rupert is one of the hardest
things I've ever had to do.

1899
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,213
感觉很不对劲
It just felt wrong,
so wrong on every level

1900
01:27:57,296 --> 01:27:59,131
感觉非常不对

1901
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:01,842
因为丹、鲁伯特和我像兄弟姐妹
because Dan, Rupert and I
are so much siblings.

1902
01:28:04,887 --> 01:28:06,055
你还好吗？
See you later.

1903
01:28:06,138 --> 01:28:07,223
哈利
- Harry.
- All three of us, I think

1904
01:28:07,306 --> 01:28:10,810
我们三个都觉得
这对我们意义一样重大
felt so matched in how much
it meant to us.

1905
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:16,857
我记得那一幕
你说「不，我得自己去」
I remember the scene
when you were like

1906
01:28:14,939 --> 01:28:16,774
"No guys. I'm the one
who has to go on my own

1907
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:18,442
在这一部片里
kind of thing, on this,
this one."

1908
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,569
我拥抱你道别
And I gave you the hug
to say goodbye.

1909
01:28:20,653 --> 01:28:22,780
－我跟你去
－不，杀死蛇
- I'll go with you.
- No. Kill the snake.

1910
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:28,661
我知道我要对这系列道别
I knew I was saying goodbye
to the series.

1911
01:28:28,744 --> 01:28:31,372
我知道我在对你道别
I knew I was saying goodbye
to you.

1912
01:28:31,455 --> 01:28:36,085
我只得把我真正的感受演出来
And I just had to just bring
to the surface

1913
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,127
how I really felt about it all

1914
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,046
－即将结束
－对
- coming to an end.
- Yeah.

1915
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:48,472
（最后一战）

1916
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,645
把哈利带过桥的那一幕
很像圣经场景
It's a very biblical image
carrying Harry across the bridge.

1917
01:28:57,857 --> 01:29:01,110
你要是问ＪＫ罗琳
或任何深入参与的人
If you ask Jo, or anyone
who's deeply involved in it

1918
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:03,571
他们只会说这是善恶之战
they'll just say it's the battle
between good and evil.

1919
01:29:03,654 --> 01:29:05,239
就这么简单
It's as simple as that.

1920
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:10,786
我欠奈威这个角色良多
I owe so much to Neville
as a character.

1921
01:29:12,037 --> 01:29:14,331
我那时非常害羞
我在班上都不说话
I was very, very shy, and
I wouldn't never speak up in class.

1922
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:15,916
我都不会举手
I wouldn't put my hand up
for anything

1923
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,627
因为我跟这个角色完全一个样
because I very much was him.

1924
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:23,382
{\an5}奈威最棒的故事就是他是个冠军
Great story of Neville
is that he's the champion.

1925
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:27,803
在最后那段精彩的一幕
That wonderful bit at the end.
That great speech of Matty's.

1926
01:29:27,887 --> 01:29:29,805
马修的精彩演讲

1927
01:29:29,013 --> 01:29:30,055
You know...

1928
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,184
{\an5}当然了，善者必须赢
Good must prevail. Of course.

1929
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:34,435
{\an5}（罗比寇特兰，饰鲁霸海格）

1930
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:37,104
－哈利不在了并不重要
－退下，奈威
- Doesn't matter that Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

1931
01:29:37,188 --> 01:29:38,731
天天都有人死
People die every day.

1932
01:29:39,857 --> 01:29:41,275
我们今晚失去了哈利
We lost Harry tonight.

1933
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:46,989
但他还跟我们在一起，就在这里
He's still with us.

1934
01:29:45,988 --> 01:29:47,031
In here.

1935
01:29:50,576 --> 01:29:51,869
他们没有白死
He didn't die in vain.

1936
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:53,662
但「哈利波特」替我做的
But the thing that Harry Potter
did for me

1937
01:29:53,746 --> 01:29:56,582
不管是故事
或是我身为片中的演员
both as a story,
and as an actor in it...

1938
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:58,542
但是你会的
- But you will.
- ...was that it helped me

1939
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:01,378
帮我找到一开始
并不属于我的身份
to find at first what I'm not.

1940
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:03,088
哈利的心为我们而跳
Harry's heart did beat for us.

1941
01:30:03,172 --> 01:30:04,298
替我们所有人而跳
For all of us.

1942
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,551
因此我才能找到找到我自己
Which therefore by extension
found what I am.

1943
01:30:10,429 --> 01:30:11,639
爆爆炸
Confringo.

1944
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,236
看原著的时候
佛地魔和哈利最后的对决
When looking at the book

1945
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,110
the final confrontation
between Voldemort and Harry

1946
01:30:25,945 --> 01:30:29,031
在餐厅里发生，很多人在看
takes place in the great hall
with a huge audience watching.

1947
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:32,785
我很想拍更朴实紧凑的戏
And I really wanted
something earthier

1948
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:34,537
and more intense
and more visceral than that.

1949
01:30:32,868 --> 01:30:34,745
更血腥的戏

1950
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:38,958
因为这两个死敌
Because these two adversaries
were almost joined spiritually

1951
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:43,671
差点像怪异的分灵体那样
在精神上结合

1952
01:30:40,417 --> 01:30:43,629
if you like, in this strange,
Horcruxy way

1953
01:30:43,754 --> 01:30:48,092
我认为丹要是能抓住罗夫
把他拉下这座塔
I thought, "Wouldn't it be wonderful
if Dan just grabbed Ralph

1954
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:49,969
岂不是很棒？
and pulled him off this tower?"

1955
01:30:50,052 --> 01:30:53,055
快点，汤姆，了结一切吧
Come on, Tom. Let's finish this
the way we started it.

1956
01:30:53,973 --> 01:30:55,182
一起了结
Together.

1957
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:57,685
他们分开时，他们结合在一起
As they apparate,
they merge together.

1958
01:30:57,768 --> 01:31:02,857
我们在故事和电影里
所描述的深层联系
That deep connection
that we'd sort of threaded

1959
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:02,815
through the stories and films

1960
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,277
在他们跌下去前
你会看到这一刻
you'd visualize in that moment before
they tumble down into the courtyard.

1961
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,783
我觉得非常累
I remember
being quite physically tired.

1962
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:15,536
{\an5}我们把一切投入其中
在最后变得很累
We put everything into it.
We were exhausted, I think,
at the end.

1963
01:31:15,619 --> 01:31:18,497
我们在寒冷的月分拍摄
天空是灰色的
We were shooting in cold months
and the skies were gray.

1964
01:31:18,581 --> 01:31:20,165
我的前臂变得很紧绷
My forearm got so tight

1965
01:31:20,249 --> 01:31:23,335
因为你在施法，你得…
because this thing
that's running current in you

1966
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:23,127
that you had to...

1967
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:26,046
对他推过去
push it back at him.

1968
01:31:27,047 --> 01:31:30,342
拍摄这些电影的体能挑战
As well as the physical challenge
of making the films

1969
01:31:30,426 --> 01:31:32,636
还有一点思考的小压力
there was that small pressure
of thinking

1970
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,388
你会是完成这系列的人
you're the one
who's gonna finish this.

1971
01:31:34,597 --> 01:31:37,725
一定要有很棒的结尾
一定要很有意义
It has to go out on a high.
It has to be meaningful.

1972
01:31:37,808 --> 01:31:40,644
一定要引起共鸣，要让人满意
It has to resonate.
It has to deliver.

1973
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:30,027
（新的开始）

1974
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:31,987
你是谁？
Who are you?

1975
01:32:32,071 --> 01:32:34,949
我叫埃玛华生
我饰演妙丽格兰杰这个角色
Hello.
My name is Emma Watson

1976
01:32:33,405 --> 01:32:34,823
playing the part of Hermione Granger.

1977
01:32:35,866 --> 01:32:37,993
－不要
－我不想被人看到我这样
I've gone all shy.
- No, never.
- I'd rather be never seen like this.

1978
01:32:38,077 --> 01:32:39,703
－什么？
－算了
- What?
- Never mind.

1979
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:40,996
不想被人看到这样？
- Rather not be seen like this? Why?
- Yeah.

1980
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,331
－对
－为什么？

1981
01:32:42,414 --> 01:32:44,166
因为他不喜欢头发上有发夹
Because he doesn't like
the clip in his hair.

1982
01:32:44,249 --> 01:32:45,668
－对
－雷德克里夫先生
- Yeah.
- It's a rad clip.

1983
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:47,086
对
Yep.

1984
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,963
是摄影机
Camera off.

1985
01:32:49,046 --> 01:32:50,631
－你怎么…
－你是媒体
- What did the cam...
- You're from the press.

1986
01:32:50,714 --> 01:32:52,800
我是媒体，没错，你怎么知道？
I'm from the press, exactly.
How did he know?

1987
01:32:52,883 --> 01:32:54,760
今天是你第一天开拍
感觉怎样？
It's your first day.
How does it feel?

1988
01:32:54,843 --> 01:32:57,054
感觉非常棒
It feels absolutely fantastic.

1989
01:32:57,137 --> 01:32:59,765
－你很期待吗？
－很期待
Are you excited?

1990
01:32:58,305 --> 01:32:59,431
Very much so.

1991
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:01,433
我等不及了
- Yes.
- I can't wait.

1992
01:33:01,517 --> 01:33:03,143
在这些准备之后
After all this preparation.

1993
01:33:03,686 --> 01:33:04,770
终于要发生了
Finally happening.
Okay, get back to work.

1994
01:33:04,853 --> 01:33:07,272
回去工作，大家需要替你准备

1995
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,231
People need to pamper you.

1996
01:33:07,356 --> 01:33:08,691
对
- Yep.
- Hey hey.

1997
01:33:13,612 --> 01:33:16,824
鲁伯特，你回想过去时
你现在感觉怎样？
What do you think about
when you think about it now, Rupert?

1998
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,199
Like, as you look back on.
Like, for me

1999
01:33:16,907 --> 01:33:19,201
对我而言，那是很美好的回忆
你呢？
- it's very good memories.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

2000
01:33:19,284 --> 01:33:20,744
我很骄傲是这些电影的一份子
- Like, what is it for you?
- I'm very proud
to have been part of them.

2001
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:22,579
我认为到最后
I think towards the end,
it was kind of a weird time.

2002
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:25,332
那时候有点怪异，尤其是结束时

2003
01:33:23,706 --> 01:33:25,332
- Yeah.
- Especially kind of finishing.

2004
01:33:25,749 --> 01:33:29,586
我觉得我忘了自己是谁
还有那个角色是谁
I feel like I lost track
of who I was

2005
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,256
我不知道从哪里结束或开始
and who the character was,
didn't really know
where they ended or began.

2006
01:33:32,339 --> 01:33:34,758
让我开始自问「我是谁？」
Yeah. There were some things
that I'm just like

2007
01:33:33,716 --> 01:33:35,843
"Who, who am I?
Like, What do I like to do?

2008
01:33:34,842 --> 01:33:37,136
「我喜欢做什么？
这对我有什么重要性？」

2009
01:33:35,926 --> 01:33:37,094
What, what is important to me?"

2010
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:39,722
那很怪异
连我的名字都不像我的名字
- Like, it's weird things.
- Yeah.

2011
01:33:38,303 --> 01:33:39,888
Even my name
didn't feel like my name.

2012
01:33:39,805 --> 01:33:42,307
－对
－我只知道怎么做一件事
- Yeah.
- I felt I really only knew

2013
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:43,809
－对
－我只知道怎么饰演荣恩
how to do one thing.
- Yeah.
- I knew how to play Ron.

2014
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:45,019
荣恩是我最爱的角色
Ron was my favorite character

2015
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:47,479
能在电影里饰演这个角色
真的很酷
so it was so cool
being him in the film.

2016
01:33:47,938 --> 01:33:51,775
根本像我们用最极端的方法演戏
It's almost like we did
the most extreme form

2017
01:33:50,524 --> 01:33:51,734
of method acting.

2018
01:33:52,985 --> 01:33:54,903
总得在某个时候结束
It always had to end at some point.

2019
01:33:54,987 --> 01:33:57,823
我们不可能永远拍下去
We were never gonna be doing this...

2020
01:33:57,072 --> 01:33:58,115
forever.

2021
01:33:58,657 --> 01:34:01,702
对现在的我来说，看到你在这里
The way it feels for me now

2022
01:34:00,242 --> 01:34:03,245
like, seeing you here,
having had time apart...

2023
01:34:01,785 --> 01:34:03,620
我们分隔了一段时间

2024
01:34:04,621 --> 01:34:06,373
我想尽量不要太感伤
I'm trying not to get emotional.

2025
01:34:06,457 --> 01:34:09,001
感觉像你是我人生中的支柱
It feels like you're like
a pillar of my life.

2026
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:11,628
好窝心，因为我看着你长大
It's a very overwhelming thing,
because I've watched you grow up.

2027
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,547
我们看着彼此长大
我们是一起长大的
We've watched each other grow up.
We grew up together. We're family.

2028
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:14,840
我们是一家人

2029
01:34:15,799 --> 01:34:18,677
我们会永远是一家人
我们不用见彼此…天啊
We always will be.
We don't need to see each other.

2030
01:34:17,468 --> 01:34:18,635
Oh, my God.

2031
01:34:19,219 --> 01:34:22,431
即使我们不常见到彼此
Even though we don't see each other
all the time...

2032
01:34:23,474 --> 01:34:25,100
对，这…
Yeah, it's a...

2033
01:34:26,643 --> 01:34:29,480
我们永远会有很紧密的羁绊
it's a strong...

2034
01:34:27,853 --> 01:34:29,438
a strong bond that we'll always have

2035
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:32,566
而我们总会是彼此人生的一份子
and we will always be part
of each other's life.

2036
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:47,247
－很高兴看到你
－看到你真好
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

2037
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,292
我爱你
I love you.

2038
01:34:56,423 --> 01:34:57,508
是朋友那种爱
As a friend.

2039
01:35:00,594 --> 01:35:03,555
－让观赏的大家搞清楚
－说清楚
Just to be clear

2040
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:02,930
- for everyone watching.
- Just to be clear.

2041
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:06,850
但这是真的，我们有好多爱
But it's true.

2042
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:06,767
There's so much love.

2043
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,352
谢了，鲁伯特
Thanks, Rupes.

2044
01:35:08,435 --> 01:35:11,271
今天还是排练，回放和…
So let's just do a rehearsal,
and let's just wade back in.

2045
01:35:10,854 --> 01:35:12,314
Just wade back into the plot.

2046
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:14,149
等准备好就开演
When you're ready. And action.

2047
01:35:16,026 --> 01:35:18,320
我们在最后那几幕都很投入
When we were all wrapping up
those final scenes

2048
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:23,033
我们在整个拍片过程
拍的最后几幕
one of the last shots we did
in the entire shoot...

2049
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:25,577
我们都跳过摄影机
We were diving past the camera,
and landing on this huge crash mat.

2050
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:28,622
掉在防护垫上

2051
01:35:28,705 --> 01:35:30,541
那就是最后一幕
That was what it all came down to

2052
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,210
这一个镜头是我们跳进烟囱
this one take of us
jumping in a chimney.

2053
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:36,922
这是对事实的比喻
It was such a metaphor
for what was actually happening.

2054
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:41,593
我们得跳上垫子到另一个世界去
We had to, like, jump onto a mat,
basically

2055
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,677
to travel into another world.

2056
01:35:42,845 --> 01:35:46,306
大家的情绪都很强烈
The collective emotion
was incredibly palpable.

2057
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:50,060
对于支持他们
和持续挺他们的人而言
And for the people
who'd supported them

2058
01:35:48,183 --> 01:35:50,060
and had been there for them
throughout.

2059
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:53,230
看他们长大的所有人
Everybody who'd seen them grow up.

2060
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:56,859
All right then.

2061
01:35:57,609 --> 01:35:59,611
在最后一天，我非常难过
On that last day, I just lost it.

2062
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:04,992
我记得我们都抱着彼此
I remember all of us
just holding each other.

2063
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,496
我们三个都…
All three of us were like...

2064
01:36:10,205 --> 01:36:11,248
非常难过
utterly devastated.

2065
01:36:14,084 --> 01:36:19,423
我认为那是我们第一次
让自己面对甚至是感受到…
I think it was the first time
we allowed ourselves

2066
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:20,674
to even process
or realize we'd done it.

2067
01:36:19,506 --> 01:36:22,426
我们办到了，我们做到了

2068
01:36:20,924 --> 01:36:22,176
We'd made it through.

2069
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:27,347
这也在我内心深处
我用这些电影来衡量我的生活
It's so ingrained in me as well.

2070
01:36:24,428 --> 01:36:26,889
Like, I measure my life
with these movies.

2071
01:36:27,431 --> 01:36:29,641
有人问「你何时考到驾照的？」
Someone says, like, "Oh, when did
you pass your driving test?"

2072
01:36:29,725 --> 01:36:31,852
我说「拍凤凰会的密令的时候」
I'm like, "Order of the Phoenix."

2073
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:36,648
我人生的每个部分
都跟「哈利波特」有关
Every part of my life
is connected to Potter.

2074
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:42,237
我认识很多人
这系列对他们意义重大
When I meet people who, it's a really
important part of their life

2075
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:44,281
也认识书籍或电影
对他们意义重大的人
or the books or the films
were in some way, like

2076
01:36:44,364 --> 01:36:46,491
这系列像是他们身份的一部分
a part of their identity, it...

2077
01:36:46,575 --> 01:36:48,577
对，这让你很骄傲
Yeah, it just makes you really proud.

2078
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:52,289
「哈利波特」让人生更丰富
There's something about Harry Potter
that makes life richer.

2079
01:36:52,372 --> 01:36:55,792
当事情变黑暗，日子变很困难时
Like, when things get really dark
and times are really hard

2080
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:58,420
我们可以进入这个故事中
stories give us places we can go
where we can rest and feel held.

2081
01:36:58,503 --> 01:37:00,297
让我们得以休息

2082
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,591
感觉有人在支持着你

2083
01:37:02,674 --> 01:37:04,635
我那时候应该不了解
I don't think I fully appreciated
the reach that these films had

2084
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:06,762
我们拍过的那些电影有这种影响

2085
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:08,513
很多人说过…
when we were in them.
The amount of people
that have said things like

2086
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:10,933
「这是我爸爸和我
唯一一起看过的电影」
"These are the only films
my dad and I watched together.

2087
01:37:11,016 --> 01:37:12,392
「我们都不聊其他的事情」
Like, we can't talk about
anything else

2088
01:37:12,476 --> 01:37:14,686
「我们一起看哈利波特
这是我们一起做的事」
and like,
we watch Harry Potter together.

2089
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:14,645
That's been our thing."

2090
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:18,065
能带来这种影响真棒
It's amazing
to be a small kind of part of that.

2091
01:37:18,148 --> 01:37:20,484
看着这系列继续存在
And just seeing it
kind of re-live on.

2092
01:37:20,567 --> 01:37:21,693
找到新的媒体
Finding new mediums

2093
01:37:21,777 --> 01:37:24,071
像是舞台戏、「怪兽」系列
like the stage show,
Fantastic Beasts.

2094
01:37:24,154 --> 01:37:28,784
像是永远活下去，看到这样真棒
It's just kind of...

2095
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:28,700
living forever,
and it's amazing to see it.

2096
01:37:28,867 --> 01:37:31,703
哈利波特…
Harry Potter! Harry Potter!

2097
01:37:31,787 --> 01:37:34,706
没有故事像「哈利波特」一样
There's nothing like
the stories of Harry Potter.

2098
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:38,335
{\an5}电影里诉说的这些故事
这些角色的旅程
The stories told within them,
the individual characters' journeys.

2099
01:37:38,418 --> 01:37:41,755
我认为这对大家
有重大改变的影响
I just think that has such
a transformative effect on people.

2100
01:37:41,838 --> 01:37:43,257
这就是魔法
That's magic.

2101
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,383
这里真美
It's beautiful here.

2102
01:37:44,466 --> 01:37:47,594
{\an5}每个孩子都不知道要怎么适应…
Every child wonders
how they're going to fit in

2103
01:37:47,678 --> 01:37:48,887
（托比琼斯，饰多比）

2104
01:37:48,971 --> 01:37:52,307
{\an5}这是每个孩子史诗般的旅程
and it's an epic journey
that every child goes on.

2105
01:37:52,391 --> 01:37:54,768
多比会永远服侍哈利波特
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

2106
01:37:54,851 --> 01:37:58,397
这对年轻人很鼓舞人心
「主角可能是我」
It's very inspiring
for young people to go

2107
01:37:57,104 --> 01:37:58,397
"Oh, that could be me there

2108
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,232
「经历那些自我怀疑
或不确定的时刻」
having that moment of doubt

2109
01:38:00,315 --> 01:38:01,858
「或跟父母吵架」
or that wobble
or that argument with my parents."

2110
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:05,946
待在我身边
Stay close to me.

2111
01:38:06,029 --> 01:38:07,447
直到最后
Until the end.

2112
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:13,453
{\an5}我投入了一个很棒的世界
I have found it

2113
01:38:11,076 --> 01:38:13,537
an extraordinary world
to be involved with

2114
01:38:13,537 --> 01:38:15,831
这个世界很棒
and it's a beautiful world.

2115
01:38:15,914 --> 01:38:17,332
敬哈利
- Harry.
- Harry.

2116
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,376
－敬哈利
－敬哈利

2117
01:38:19,459 --> 01:38:22,170
这很深刻，很疗愈
- Harry.
- And that's what's
so profoundly therapeutic
and good about it

2118
01:38:22,254 --> 01:38:24,715
{\an5}而且很棒，因为这是…

2119
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:28,844
is it's made people who otherwise
feel lonely, they feel they belong.

2120
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:27,592
{\an5}由孤独的人制作的

2121
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:29,219
他们不会感觉格格不入

2122
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:30,637
别给他，哈利
Don't give it to her, Harry.

2123
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,184
多数来跟我打招呼的影迷
Most of the fans
that come up and say hello to me now

2124
01:38:36,268 --> 01:38:38,520
{\an5}甚至是在我们拍电影后才出生的
weren't even born
when we made the film.

2125
01:38:38,603 --> 01:38:39,646
{\an5}（汤姆费尔顿，饰跩哥马份）
So it quickly makes you feel
slightly older

2126
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:42,607
{\an5}很快就让你觉得自己老了

2127
01:38:42,691 --> 01:38:49,197
我很感激这系列传到了下一代
and very grateful that it's been
passed down to other generations.

2128
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:50,991
你在跳芭蕾，波特？
Training for the ballet, Potter?

2129
01:38:55,287 --> 01:38:57,497
{\an5}「哈利波特」的独特之处
One of the things that was unique
about Harry Potter

2130
01:38:57,581 --> 01:38:59,499
{\an5}除了难以置信的想象力
besides the incredible imagination
and world

2131
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:04,212
和ＪＫ罗琳创造的
这些世界和角色之外
and characters
that Jo Rowling created

2132
01:39:04,296 --> 01:39:09,509
你还可以看到年轻人长成大人
was the fact that you get to see
young children grow into adults.

2133
01:39:09,968 --> 01:39:11,970
在电影看到这个历程
And to see that journey on film

2134
01:39:12,054 --> 01:39:14,348
我认为我们并没有看过这种事
I don't think
we've ever seen that before.

2135
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:16,183
我不知道我们会不会再次见识到
I don't know
if we'll ever see it again.

2136
01:39:16,266 --> 01:39:19,227
我觉得很幸运
可以成为这世界的一份子
It just feels so lucky
that I get to be part of a world that

2137
01:39:19,311 --> 01:39:20,771
大家很爱的这个世界
people love so much,
and makes people happy.

2138
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:22,898
让大家开心的这个世界

2139
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:26,068
你可以找到逃避现实的东西
There's something about those...
The escapism you find.

2140
01:39:26,151 --> 01:39:28,070
逃避现实的健康方式
The healthy form of escapism.

2141
01:39:28,153 --> 01:39:30,906
我认为这就是
「哈利波特」的可贵之处
That, I think,
is kind of what Harry Potter does.

2142
01:39:30,989 --> 01:39:32,282
这就是这些故事的目的
And that's what
these stories are for.

2143
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:34,743
这些故事是生活指南
They are a guide to how to live.

2144
01:39:34,826 --> 01:39:37,496
我认为这是一个世代的结束
那是我人生的十年
I just think it's an end of an era.

2145
01:39:36,036 --> 01:39:37,412
It's a ten, ten years of my life

2146
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:40,749
而我的孩子们是在这期间长大的
and my children
have grown up during it.

2147
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:40,832
Of course.

2148
01:39:40,832 --> 01:39:43,126
罗比寇特兰
That is Robbie Coltrane

2149
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,669
霍格沃茨最棒的猎场看守人
finest gatekeeper in Hogwarts'
last day on Harry Potter.

2150
01:39:44,753 --> 01:39:46,505
今天是他拍
「哈利波特」的最后一天

2151
01:39:53,762 --> 01:39:54,971
我怀疑这系列电影的影响
The legacy of the movies
is that my children's generation

2152
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:58,225
我孩子们那一代
会给他们的孩子看

2153
01:39:56,181 --> 01:39:58,058
will show them to their children.

2154
01:39:58,308 --> 01:40:00,936
所以可以５０年后再看
So you could be watching it
in 50 years time, easy.

2155
01:40:02,312 --> 01:40:04,439
可惜我到时候已经不在了…
I'll not be here, sadly, but...

2156
01:40:05,982 --> 01:40:08,527
想都不要想
Don't you think on it for one minute.

2157
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,196
但是海格那时候还会在
But Hagrid will.

2158
01:40:10,612 --> 01:40:11,655
Yes.

2159
01:40:13,532 --> 01:40:15,534
现在回想起来
Kind of looking back at it now,
and...

2160
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:17,452
就是很美好的回忆
just really fond memories.

2161
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,954
我很常回想
I think about it a lot.

2162
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:21,289
那段时光很棒…
It was a great time.
It really was. It was...

2163
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:24,084
真的很棒
It was amazing.

2164
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:26,461
真的是最棒…
It was just the best, most...

2165
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:29,673
最精彩的旅程
amazing experience, and...

2166
01:40:31,174 --> 01:40:33,802
我没办法解释，他们人都超好的
I can't really explain to you.
Like, they're such good people.

2167
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:36,054
他们都很善良又…
They were so kind, and...

2168
01:40:37,389 --> 01:40:40,392
他们都很认真地承担责任
they both took the responsibility
very seriously, and I...

2169
01:40:40,475 --> 01:40:43,895
而我对他们这样非常感激

2170
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:43,937
appreciated that so much.

2171
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:45,856
我们真的很像一家人
It really is like family.

2172
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:48,400
内心都联系在一起
We're just so intrinsically linked.

2173
01:40:49,901 --> 01:40:51,820
他们对我来说是很重要的人
They're very important people to me.

2174
01:40:52,988 --> 01:40:54,990
电影的工作人员真不可思议
The crew on these films
were unbelievable.

2175
01:40:55,073 --> 01:40:56,867
这些电影里有一些人…
There are people on these films
that are...

2176
01:40:58,994 --> 01:41:03,331
are foundational to who I am...

2177
01:41:01,496 --> 01:41:03,498
奠定了我身份的基础

2178
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:09,129
身为一个人和演员
as a person and an actor.

2179
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:13,300
我很幸运能有现在的成就
经历了这种人生
I feel so lucky to be where I am

2180
01:41:11,548 --> 01:41:13,258
and to have the life that I have

2181
01:41:13,383 --> 01:41:16,136
能跟现在身边的人合作
and be able to work
with the people I work with now.

2182
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:19,306
但没有这系列，这些都不可能
But none of it is possible
without this.

2183
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:21,725
所以…
So yeah. It was...

2184
01:41:22,684 --> 01:41:23,894
这非常…
It was very...

2185
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:26,771
这十年非常棒
It was a very good ten years.

2186
01:41:30,358 --> 01:41:32,986
疾疾，护法现身
Expecto patronum.

2187
01:41:44,789 --> 01:41:46,208
过了这么久？
After all this time.

2188
01:41:47,626 --> 01:41:48,835
永远
Always.

2189
01:42:44,766 --> 01:42:46,768
谢谢观赏
