because my daughter Eleanor

"Well, 'Philosopher's Stone'
is there on the bookshelf."

the characters so relatable.

perfectly designed universe.

00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,150
I think it's very easy
to forget that, at the time,

101
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,069
people were talking about,
like, the death of reading.

102
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,822
I just think it's a beautiful
creative outlook on life,

in limitless possibilities.

is that millions
would now read books

And then in terms of casting,

110
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:06,551
it was... the search
for Harry Potter was insane.

111
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,178
The new "Harry Potter" film
are looking for children

112
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,599
to play the three main roles in
the multi-million-pound film.

113
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,353
I remember going to the...
the very first audition,

114
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,606
and there was hundreds
if not thousands of people.

115
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,941
And then we realized that

116
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,401
we were the only set
of twins there

117
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,819
who weren't wearing
identical clothing.

118
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,696
So we ended up
going over the road

119
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,991
and bought two identical
matching tops.

- Just off the rack.
- Just off the rack.

We were like,
"Right, they will do."

122
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,370
And then off we went.

123
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:37,248
They'd let us all mill,
you know, sort of congregate

124
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,208
till they "seemingly"
walked away,

125
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,877
and, of course, while there's
still one gentleman

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,546
holding a boom mic
straight over our heads.

127
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,717
And this little girl
asked me, "What's that?"

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,970
I think I even said,
"It's a mic, duh."

129
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,263
I was like, "They're filming us."

130
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,723
"This is just, like, a trick."

131
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,474
Like, as if I'd done it
before, really.

132
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,226
And I remember it,
'cause it was Emma.

133
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,811
I became completely gripped

134
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,023
by the excitement
around this audition.

135
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,401
And I always knew
that I was going for Hermione

136
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,236
in a way that I think
terrified my parents

137
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,946
because they were like,

138
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,824
"What are we gonna do with her
if she doesn't get the part?"

139
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,992
I was just excited.

140
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,327
I wasn't sort of daunted.

141
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,912
I wasn't thinking,
"I wonder how many"

142
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,330
"films they're gonna make,
anything like that."

143
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,831
I thought,
"Oh, this will be fun."

144
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,791
I think the biggest pressure
at the beginning

145
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,210
was who was gonna be
Harry Potter.

146
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,628
We couldn't find Harry.

147
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,755
We couldn't...
we just couldn't find Harry,

148
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,381
and it was getting
kind of weird,

149
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,758
um, and panicky.

150
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,345
I was in my hotel room
in London one night

151
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,680
watching the BBC version
of "David Copperfield."

152
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,432
Immediately, a light bulb
went off in my head,

153
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,392
and I said,
"This is Harry Potter."

154
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,229
This is the kid we've been
looking for for months.

155
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,939
So I asked the casting director,

156
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,107
I said, "We've gotta get him
in here for an audition."

157
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,776
She said,
"It's never gonna happen."

158
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,737
"His parents do not want him
involved in this world."

159
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,280
"They don't want him
to take this role."

160
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,115
I think the deal
was to sign on for, like,

161
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,326
all seven films and they would
be filmed in LA.

162
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,036
So Mum and Dad were like,
"No, that's, like,"

163
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,663
"a huge disruption to his life."

164
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,123
Fortunately, David Heyman,

165
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,793
uh, went to the theater
a few weeks later.

166
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,628
These two guys
in the row in front of me

167
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,129
started sort of turning round.

168
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,257
David, being the great
producer that he is,

169
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,135
convinced Dan's father to bring
Dan in for an audition.

170
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,098
And that's basically
when we got our Harry Potter.

171
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,683
And action.

172
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,476
- That's a dragon egg.
- What is it?

173
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,311
- That's what that is.
- What is that?

174
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,437
A dragon egg.

175
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,605
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

176
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,982
I was a very happy kid who had

177
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,984
a really haunted quality,
apparently.

178
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,486
"You're really sweet,
but you looked like"

179
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,822
"you had real, like,
stuff going on."

180
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,825
It was very emotional,
actually, seeing this kid

181
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,743
sitting there talking,
and I just thought,

182
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,829
"Yeah, that's him.
Thank God we found him."

183
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,165
Rupert and Emma
were very easy to cast

184
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,084
because they felt like
they jumped off the page.

185
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,836
We screen-tested
the three of them together

186
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,838
to make sure that
they all had this chemistry,

187
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,507
which immediately was obvious
in the first screen test.

188
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,467
Remember, guys,
get closer to her

189
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,219
as she finds out
the information.

190
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,804
And action.

191
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,349
I never thought to look in here.

192
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,686
I checked this out first term
for a bit of light reading.

193
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,355
- This is light?
- Shut up.

194
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,150
If Filch comes around
the corner any second now,

195
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,153
at least 50 points
off Gryffindor.

196
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,825
I knew it! Here it is.

197
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,369
Nicholas Flamel
is the only known

198
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,372
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

199
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,874
Both: The what?

200
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,543
Oh, honestly,
don't you two read?

201
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,670
Cut. Good job.

202
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,839
It's lovely seeing you.

203
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,841
Yeah, this is surreal, isn't it?

204
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,677
How do we all feel being back
and talking about this?

205
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,805
Well, A, really emotional,
obviously.

206
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,850
And B, um, it feels like
no time has passed

207
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,020
and loads of time has passed
simultaneously.

208
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,605
Yeah, kind of much the same.
It's quite surreal.

209
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,815
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

210
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,651
It doesn't feel like we've
kind of earned a reunion yet.

211
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,028
- Yeah.
- I know.

212
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,155
I have had kidney stones
and a baby,

213
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,573
so time has obviously passed.
(LAUGHTER)

214
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,492
- You did mention that.
- I feel my age.

215
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,536
But there is, like,
such a collection

216
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,413
of, like, shared memories
and stuff

217
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,915
that we just all did together
that it is

218
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,583
immediately
very easy to be, like...

219
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,251
to sort of slip back
into where you were.

220
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,796
Our first audition, the...
the day we all met...

221
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,673
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- I think for the first time,

222
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,424
there was, like, me walking
out of my dressing room

223
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,385
and seeing, like, another, like,

224
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,261
young, brown-haired boy
going the other way.

225
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,638
I never saw his face,
but I was like,

226
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,931
"You are clearly another Harry"

227
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,432
"that is being
tested out today."

228
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,017
- And they were, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,602
Testing us with various
different configurations

230
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,686
of Ron, Harry, and Hermione.

231
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,105
I remember there was one

232
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,898
where they put all
the three of us together.

233
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,734
I do remember that
when it was the three of us,

234
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,570
- something felt different...
- Right. Yeah.

235
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,281
And, like, right and easy.
I do remember the click.

236
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,075
We'd been out at the studios.

237
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,494
They'd told us we got the parts
and they were like, "Cool."

238
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,329
"So we're announcing
you've got the parts."

239
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,124
"There is now going to be a lot
of media outside your house."

240
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,375
"So you can't go home."

241
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,835
So far, it's sort of

242
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,712
turned things upside down.
(LAUGHTER)

243
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,132
Um, it's... I don't know,

244
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,926
I've never had anything
happen to me like this before.

245
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,971
Hermione made
complete sense to me.

246
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,597
That's me.

247
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,307
Like, I am that girl.

248
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,311
Well, Emma was arguably
the smartest person on the set,

249
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,896
and I'm talking about everybody.

250
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,357
She just was...
she was a brilliant kid.

251
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,860
I think I'm scarily
like my character.

252
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,695
(LAUGHTER)

253
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,656
'Cause I live in a family
of, um, seven

254
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,867
and, um, I've got
a redheaded sister

255
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,243
and I live in a burrow.

256
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,745
Rupert is just the most
camera-ready

257
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,331
12-year-old boy in the world
at that point.

258
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,878
Like, he was so,
like, just fearless.

259
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,006
Rupert was Ron, you know,

260
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,425
and Dan kind of was Harry.

261
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,677
How do you feel
about becoming famous?

262
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,096
- It'd be cool.
- (LAUGHTER)

263
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,598
We were all talking about this,

264
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,184
how comfortable you made us all
in our auditions

265
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,435
and how, like, this, like,

266
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,562
extended massively into the set.

267
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,356
My memory of it is that
it seemed effortless to you.

268
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,651
Well, on the first film,
I was dying the entire time,

269
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,528
but I just... I always believe

270
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,405
you cannot bring
that kind of anxiety.

271
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,240
I want everyone
to feel comfortable.

272
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,950
I want everyone
to feel like it's a family.

273
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,869
I want everyone
to feel like they're home.

274
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,039
(JOHN WILLIAMS'
"THE JOURNEY TO HOGWARTS")

275
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:17,213
♪♪♪

276
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,683
Hey, class, listen to me.

277
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,268
Welcome to your first
flying lesson.

278
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,896
I want you to raise your hand
over the broom.

279
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,856
For the first several weeks
on the film,

280
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,527
the kids are basically in shock.

281
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,238
Looking back, I am sort
of amazed at the fact

282
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,448
that I wasn't ever, like,
completely overwhelmed by it.

283
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,534
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Dan, when you turn away

284
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,744
from her this time...
when you turn away,

285
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,246
grab hold of this,

286
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,373
and look up like you're
going to get it, okay?

287
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,416
But I also think
that was, again, part of Chris

288
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,876
and the whole crew just, like,

289
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,503
they kept us having fun
the whole time.

290
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Obviously, we were just kids,
and we were all

291
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,674
looking forward
to mucking about together.

292
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,801
Chris Columbus
made the atmosphere

293
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,469
very much like a funfair.

294
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,889
We were very much just, like,
kids being kids on a set.

295
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,391
- Mm-hmm.
- My residing memory

296
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,810
from the first...
from "Philosopher's Stone"

297
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,603
is I just learned
how to play slam.

298
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,022
You know what we did a lot of
as well was that game.

299
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,315
- Oh, my God.
- Slaps.

300
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,775
- So much hand slaps.
- Oh, slaps.

301
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,193
With, like, all of us,
like, red...

302
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,945
like, red, raw hands from, like,

303
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,446
- hitting each other really hard.
- I think we also upgraded

304
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,615
- to knuckles as well.
- Oh, and shins.

305
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,033
- Yeah.
- I remember the shin version.

306
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,868
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,622
- Sorry. Gotta give it back.
- (LAUGHTER)

308
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,333
I am the champion!

309
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,961
They probably made their jobs
harder for themselves

310
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,796
by letting us have
as much fun as we had

311
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,423
because it distracted us from,

312
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,049
you know, the work
we were supposed to be doing.

313
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,885
And for the other viewers,

00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,632
one keeper,
and the seeker... that's you.

471
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,010
So Jo Rowling basically did
a rule book for us.

472
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,386
A Quidditch rule book

473
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,640
explaining every detail
of the game.

474
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,600
Then, with Stuart Craig,
our production designer,

475
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,810
designed the look
of the Quidditch pitch

476
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:33,815
and really create a pitch
that felt authentic and real

477
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,818
for a game
that is completely unreal.

478
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,821
Lots of energy, enthusiasm.

479
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,323
Set and action!

480
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,284
- She scores!
- Angelina Johnson scores!

481
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,078
Ten points for Gryffindor.

482
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,329
I always wanted
to tell you this,

483
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,747
but there was a moment,
you know,

484
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,123
on day two maybe or three,

485
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,834
the camera pushes into you
and you say,

486
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,378
"We're not going home,
not really."

487
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,965
Feels strange to be
going home, doesn't it?

488
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,217
I'm not going home.

489
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,135
Not really.

490
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,804
I got tears...
I still get tears in my eyes

491
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,181
thinking about it.
I thought, "This guy...""

492
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:08,183
"This kid is an amazing actor."

493
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,435
- Oh, that's...
- And it was that moment

494
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,646
that kind of opened up
the whole world for us.

495

And the first film was very
storybook, very inviting.

Yeah, it's lovely and...

497
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,068
It's like,
"Welcome to Hogwarts."

498
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,528
Until you get to the end
of the movie.

499
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,154
And where a man...
I melt a man's face.

playing Lucius

being in the story to me

the sense that the dementors,

786
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:57,392
what they do is they suck
all the joy away,

787
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,813
that they were sucking
an essence of Harry.

788
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,899
But I think that the most
important piece

789
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:08,152
to achieve that
was Dan's performance.

790
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,740
When was "Azkaban"...
how old were you?

791
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,075
14.

792
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,368
- Really?
- Yeah.

793
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,953
- When we first met?
- Yeah.

794
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,415
I think I had a natural
sort of paternal thing.

795
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,584
(BOTH GRUNTING)

796
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,504
(CHUCKLES)

797
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,631
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

798
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,550
The first person I remember
being, like,

799
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,468
in order of when they came in
was Gary.

800
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,053
I remember that. I remember...

801
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,597
I remember you
giving me the Gary chat.

802
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,267
Yeah, you were like, "Listen,
Emma, you need to be cool",

803
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,811
"because Gary Oldman...
it's a really big deal,

804
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,397
and you need to be cool,"
and I was like, "Okay."

805
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,149
And which was... which
was really a projection

806
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,900
of my own fears
'cause I was like,

807
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,903
"Dan, you need to be cool.
This guy's a big deal."

808
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,615
Dan was first a bit daunted.

809
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,119
And Gary was amazingly generous
as a person,

810
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,997
but also as an actor,
and immediately embrace him

811
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,125
and include him
in... in the acting process.

812
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,420
It was really sweet
to... to see the two of them.

813
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:11,966
And it was almost as if it was
mirroring that relationship

814
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,011
because, in many ways,
Harry has made a totem

815
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,971
out of Sirius Black.

816
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:20,266
That totem
that is kind of unapproachable

817
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,310
and in many ways scary.

818
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,604
And then that was not unlike
in the film

819
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,231
that when they discover
who they truly are,

820
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,817
is when suddenly
there's an amazing bond.

821
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,069
You saw them between takes

822
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,906
sitting with each other,
talking and laughing.

823
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,825
And you could see in the way
that Dan looked at Gary

824
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,662
the adulation and the respect
that he had for him.

825
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,331
All the stuff in
the Shrieking Shack at the end,

826
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,999
I feel like me and Rupert
and Emma were just, like,

827
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,209
watching tennis in that scene
just being like,

828
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,752
"This is acting, guys."

829
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,837
"This is what we all need
to be working towards."

830
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,006
There was Tim Spall,

831
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,966
- the one and only Alan Rickman.
- Yeah.

832
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,012
David Thewlis, you,
Emma, Rupert.

833
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,847
It's really nice of you
to include me, Emma, and Rupert

834
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,973
in that group.

835
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,433
To watch you guys act but also

836
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,143
just watching you guys as people

837
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,354
and just watching these,
like, incredible actors

838
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,022
who were just like,
"Oh, yeah, no."

839
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,941
"You're just people
and you'd have fun in between"

840
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,776
"and the whole process
doesn't have to be painful."

841
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,736
It can be intense
and you showed me the wonders

842
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,197
of that sometimes as well
and that was really important.

843
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,865
- Let's kill him!
- Wait.

844
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:23,162
I did my waiting!
12 years of it!

845
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,956
In Azkaban!

846
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,415
I have never done a scene

847
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,835
with such an amazing cast
in my life.

848
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,503
It's a very long scene.

849
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,463
It's a scene in which
there are a lot of twists

850
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,007
inside the scene,
and it was so much fun.

851
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,678
It's an intense scene in which
a lot of things are at stake.

852
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,222
No! I trusted you!

853
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,809
And you can see...
Rupert and Emma and Dan...

854
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,895
that they are completely
committed to this scene.

855
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,399
I love it. I-I have such
a great memory of it.

856
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,026
I told Dumbledore
you were helping an old friend

857
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,571
into the castle,
and now here's the proof.

858
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,614
Brilliant, Snape.
Once again,

859
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,616
you've put your keen and
penetrating mind to the task,

860
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,910
and as usual,
come to the wrong conclusion.

861
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,621
I always loved
the character of Sirius.

862
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,415
I love the relationship
Harry and Sirius have.

863
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,377
He's like this cool uncle,
but also older brother figure.

864
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,088
He's painted
as this villainous guy

865
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,674
and then has the switch
where you go,

866
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,760
"Oh, he was set up
and he's a good guy."

867
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,262
And he's so kind and so warm...

868
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,597
- And he's warm and kind...
- And cool.

869
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,473
- And he's kinda cool.
- Yeah.

870
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,476
I wish I'd had
the whole picture.

871
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,478
You know, we only
ever found out book...

872
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,897
Yeah, book by book.

873
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,398
- I don't know whether you...
- I did not.

874
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,858
Because you were
Harry Potter, you had a...

875
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,192
Just Rickman.
Rickman did. That was it.

876
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,903
- Rickman?
- He had the inside line.

877
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,195
He worked that well.

878
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,989
He very, very early said to Jo,

879
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,533
he was like, "I think I need
to know what happens."

880
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,951
(AS SNAPE) I need to know.

881
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,119
(LAUGHS)

882
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:48,539
Give me a reason. I beg you.

883
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,249
Rickman would have an in,
wouldn't he?

884
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,584
He did, yeah.

885
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,127
And he never told Chris,
never told anyone.

886
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,587
He would... Chris would
literally say to him,

887
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,880
"Why are you doing that
like that?"

888
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,423
He'd say,
"I'll tell you later."

889
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,593
(BOTH LAUGHING)

890
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,680
Yeah, "You'll find out
on a need-to-know basis."

891
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,182
Wait a decade.

892
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:10,061
Dan was not a child actor.
Was another fellow actor.

893
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,313
Alfonso was like,
"Now you're teenagers,"

894
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,814
"and I'm gonna treat you
like a teenager."

895
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,358
And he was the first one
who, like,

896
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,818
- assigned us homework.
- Yeah.

897
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,195
Loosen up, loosen up.

898
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,113
He wanted to get to know us,

899
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,158
so he set us this exercise
where he asked us

900
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,035
to write an essay in character.

901
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,663
(WHISTLES)
(LAUGHTER)

902
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,998
He was like,
"You know these characters"

903
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,334
"at this point better
than I'm ever gonna be able"

904
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,295
"to understand who they are,
so you tell me."

905
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,922
And after about, sort of,

906
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,882
a half a side of A4, I was like,

907
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,968
"I feel like I've pretty much
covered everything."

908
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,262
"Like, Jo has written
a good 500 pages about this,"

909
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,848
"but I feel like this one
pretty much sums it up."

910
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,184
"Great, okay. Yeah, cool.
Proud of that. Bring that in."

911
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,355
Of course, Emma writes,
like, 12 pages,

912
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,815
like, beautifully written.

913
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,986
Rupert didn't deliver anything.

914
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,529
I didn't do it.

915
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,364
And I said, "Rupert,
where's your assignment?"

916
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:08,911
He says, "Well, uh, I thought
that Ron wouldn't do it..."

917
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,789
(LAUGHS)
"So I didn't do it."

918
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,041
I mean, luckily,
Alfonso kind of saw

919
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,918
that it was very in character
for... for...

920
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,336
for me not to have done it.

921
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,881
Rupert is Ron.

922
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,676
It's just Ron 100%.

923
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:28,222
Emma is just such
an effortless actor.

924
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,099
She prepares a lot.

925
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,560
When you're doing the scenes,
it's as if everything

926
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,228
is just flowing out of her.

927
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:37,356
The truth of the matter
is that they are great actors.

928
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,485
Sirius Black finds a redemption

929
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,990
by having Harry understanding
who he truly is.

930
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,992
It's a moment of...
of great liberation,

931
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,744
of great freedom,

932
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,831
and all of this is conveyed
symbolically in the two of them

933
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:57,543
flying in the night
under the silver moon.

We were in a big room in Oxford.

1097
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,438
Maggie's right in the middle,
and she says,

1098
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,314
"Right, I'm gonna
teach you to dance."

1099
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,485
Of course, she picks Rupert,
and she says,

1100
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,320
Place your right hand

1101
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,322
- on my waist.
- What?

1102
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,909
The kid's 14, and he knows
how to get a laugh.

1105
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,998

I didn't really know...

with a lady before,

1107
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,919

a very new thing.

forget this, are you?

James, Oliver, the twins,

1111

kind of ribbing me.

1112

1116
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,269
before we filmed it,

1117
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,022
that there was this whole,
like, dance routine planned.

1118

"Do you know your steps?

No, you know, the routine.

1120

a routine for, like,

You need to walk slower."

down the stairs.

where we were having tutoring.

1193

The assignment
that had been given

1194
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,416
was to draw what you
thought God looked like.

1195
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,463
And Tom had drawn a girl with
a backward cap on a skateboard.

1196
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,007
And I just don't know
how to say it...

00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,926
I just fell in love with him.

I think I was in the hair
and makeup chair.

1199
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,056
And someone said something
along the lines of,

1200
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,265
"Yeah, she had a crush on you."

on the call sheet.

It was number seven.

1204

And if it... if... if his number
was on the call sheet,

1205
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,900
it was an extra exciting day.

1206
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,069
He was three years above me.

1207
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,989
And so for him, he was like,
"You're like my little sister."

be more vulnerable with.

00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,059
So there was the voice.

1252
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,728
The sort of snakelike
whispered, husky,

1253
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:51,149
something that I suppose I've...
sort of whispering voice.

1254
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,110
(RASPY INHALE)
Breath on the breath.

1255
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,947
"Ah, Harry Potter..."

1256
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,157
Come to die.

1257
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,452
Ralph wanted to be
ultimately evil

1258
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,620
and otherworldly.

1259
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,956
And the best way to do that

1260
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,375
was to take his nose off.

1261
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,710
He does have a nose...
spoiler alert...

1262
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,587
and he was covered in stickers.

1263
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,675
So he was slightly less
intimidating than on-screen,

1264
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,468
except when they called action.

1265
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,554
And for some reason,
I was terrified of him.

1266
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,307
I can touch you.

1267
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,226
It took about three hours
in makeup,

1268
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,436
the painting of the hands,
the nails, the teeth,

1269
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,064
and even with my nose,

1270
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:35,694
um, I... I felt...

1271
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,487
(SCREECHING)

1272
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,074
Strong. It felt powerful.
It felt evil.

1273
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:46,663
What was big was that one
of the people that you assume

1274
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:51,209
is gonna be very important
to the story is Cedric Diggory.

1275
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:56,047
In that confrontation,
Cedric is killed.

1276
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,091
Kill the spare.

- Avada Kedavra!
- Cedric!

And Harry,
he manages to take the body

1279

and crash land back at the end
of the competition,

1280
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,192
and Cedric Diggory's father
believes that his son has won

1281
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,154
and then he realizes
that the kid is dead,

1282
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,489
and he howls like a dog.

1283
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,949

That's my boy!
(HARRY SOBBING)

1286
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,666
Suddenly, something
completely unexpected

1287
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,252
and serious happens,

1288
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,964
and suddenly you realize that
this movie is not about life.

1289
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,174
It's about death.

1290
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,634
It's such a massive scene

1291
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,218
'cause it is also the first time

1292
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,221
Harry sort of feels
that kind of death

1293
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,349
of... of somebody young,
close to him.

1294
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,644
That's a scene I remember
really distinctly going,

1295
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,479
"Oh, this is...
yes, these are kids' films,"

1296
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,314
"but my God, there's some
challenging stuff in there."

1297
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:58,818
He's back, he's back.
Voldemort's back.

1298
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,071
The moment of
Cedric Diggory's death

1299
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:05,617
is the moment
when the series comes of age,

1300
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,871
and now the children
have left childhood

1301
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,082
and are going to have
to confront

1302
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,417
the perils of adulthood.

1303
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,671
And it all comes
from that moment of death.

1304
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,507
Cedric Diggory was murdered

1305
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,342
by Lord Voldemort.

1306
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,805
The three of them,
they're in adversity,

1307
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:30,350
and that forges friendships,
as we know.

I was writing to JK Rowling
since I was about 11 years old

1561
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,647
to say thank you to her to say,

1562
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,609
I would find life a bit
hopeless without Harry Potter.

1563
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,777
Luckily for me,
she read the letter

1564
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,321
and responded to it.

1565
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,325
So I'm one of the very lucky
few people who can say

1566
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,201
JK Rowling was my pen friend.

(BOMBASTIC MUSIC)

1568
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,874
The first part of the audition

1569
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,542
is this crazy open call.

1570
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,669
Literally, anyone can come.

1571
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,672
That's my ticket.
Off we go.

1572
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,715
Let's go to London.

1573
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,425
We fly, of course.

1574
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,928
And there would be thousands
of people lining up.

1575
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,890
I remember Dan very vividly.

1576
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,350
It was on my screen test.

1577
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,768
Mistletoe.

1578
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,896
I remember him talking to me,

1579
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,606
and I kept forgetting
that I have to talk back to him

1580
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,359
because I'm so used
to watching him on a screen.

1581
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,943
So I would just
kind of be like...

1582
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,863
I kind of think
that contributed to the whole

1583
01:05:50,946 --> 01:05:55,660
Luna Lovegood vibe,
because she is a bit spacy.

1584
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,119
Hello, everyone.

1585
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,122
You look dreadful, Ron.

1586
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,001
And then he found
this secret world of odd bots,

1587
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,129
of misfits, of people
who had this strange power

1588
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,715
but who still had
enormous humanity

1589
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,550
and depth and vulnerability.

1590
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,594
The movies kind of
gave people permission

1591
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,262
to accept parts of themselves.

1592
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:18,391
So it was quite liberating
to see your oddness

1593
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,560
as a superpower
represented on-screen.

1594
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,562
I remember
when I first met you all...

1595
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,732
biggest bunch of misfits
that I ever set eyes on,

1596
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,401
and here we all are.

1597
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,944
We're still a bunch of misfits.

1598
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,780
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1599
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,491
I was not good at school.

1600
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,284
You'd be better off with
"Goshawk's Guide to Herbology."

1601
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,203
I didn't have
a huge amount of friends.

1602
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,164
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

1603
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:45,543
I think it's great
to be a misfit.

1604
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,920
And I think that's possibly
why it's so popular.

1605
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:50,589
Everyone wants to know
that they do belong.

1606
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,134
It's a great relief
of loneliness, I think.

1607
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,677
I was quite a shy kid.

1608
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,054
I could relate
to that kind of feeling

1609
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,599
of not quite knowing
what your place is.

1610
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,601
Working hard is important,

1611
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,270
but there's something
that matters even more.

1612
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,564
- Stupefy!
- Believing in yourself.

1613

(THUD)

1614
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,027
Everyone felt
more like they belonged

1615
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,197
by witnessing these characters
that didn't belong.

1616
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,286
Bonnie was,
kind of, when she arrived,

1617
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,664
she was only 9, maybe.

1618
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,249
Mummy, have you seen my jumper?

1619
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,585
Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

1620
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,044
Hello.

1621
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,173
I always found Ginny, Harry,
that relationship,

1622
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:35,050
how that kind of
slowly developed

1623
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:39,305
and entangling with it
the whole Weasley family

1624
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,683
and Harry essentially
becoming a Weasley, himself.

1625
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,311
It was something I never
really kind of expected,

1626
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,062
especially kind
of reading the books.

1627
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,814
Bonnie was the youngest one.

1628
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,400
So it was just a bit like,
"Oh, what? This is weird."

1629
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,861
Close your eyes.

1630

this kind of pressure.

01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:54,539
"Millie's got to, like,
stay in the coffin now."

1873
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,917
I have forgotten
so much of this.

1874
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,878
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

1875
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,463
I know.

1876
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:02,839
We all still look better
than we do in the epilogue.

1877
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,549
- Yes.
- I was gonna say.

1878
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,967
Which is great. Like,
we've made it in before that.

1879
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,555
- Bag?
- Yeah.

1880
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,848
Jumper?

1881
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,185
I was all forehead
and a fat suit.

1882
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:17,354
- Yeah, I was very, I was...
- I think I kind of...

1883
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:18,772
Yeah, you went for it.

1884
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,190
You were like,
"Give me the full, give me..."

1885
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:21,274
- I did, yeah.
- Give me everything.

1886
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,484
Yeah, you went all in.

1887
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:24,986
- Yeah.
- I was so proud of you.

1888
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,990
No one else can really quite
understand

1889
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,284
what we experienced;
It's a very unique thing.

1890
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:34,621
Think David Yates used
to describe us as astronauts

1891
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:38,625
'cause no one else has really
experienced this in this scale.

1892
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:41,378
And we'll be kind of
forever bonded by that.

1893
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:46,216
(HORN HONKS)

1894
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:47,717
Some of
the sweetest memories I have

1895
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,344
from the three of us
is just each of us

1896
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,846
knowing we sort of needed
to take care of each other

1897
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,348
in just small ways.

1898
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,267
Just in terms of, like,
it's really cold.

1899
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,603
Like we're all gonna...
we're all gonna stand together

1900
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,230
or I'm knackered.

1901
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:03,191
Are you okay, Dan,
if I, like, fall asleep on you,

1902
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,945
like, in between this take,
'cause I'm so tired or...

1903
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,281
I think we have all
fallen asleep in various

1904
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,699
like on... on each other

1905
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,617
in, like, some of
the most grand cathedrals

1906
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,370
and things in the UK.
(LAUGHTER)

1907
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:17,122
The level of trust I had

1908
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,292
and that we did build
over those 10 years was like,

1909
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,960
if we were doing a stunt,

1910
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,796
I trusted that
one of you would catch me.

1911
01:21:24,879 --> 01:21:26,590
I feel like that kind of
trust and reliance

1912
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,717
and that takes, you know,

1913
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,302
there's very few
work environments

1914
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,803
where you get that much time
to build that up.

1915
01:21:31,886 --> 01:21:33,555
And it was like nonverbal.
Like it was,

1916
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,390
it was like the three of us
could communicate

1917
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,684
without even having
to say anything.

1918
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:39,644
We just knew
what needed to be done.

1919
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:43,064
We were each very strong
for each other.

1920
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,900
Need to change.

1921
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,491
How, Hermione?

1922
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,535
Undetectable extension charm.

1923
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,204
You're amazing, you are.

1924
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,249
Always the tone of surprise.

1925
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,793
These films had
a very different feel.

1926
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:05,378
We were away from Hogwarts.

1927
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:08,548
A lot of the time
camping out different places.

1928
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,300
The tone was a lot darker.

1929
01:22:10,383 --> 01:22:12,010
It felt like a different film.

1930
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,095
Dumbledore sends you off
to find all these Horcruxes,

1931
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,847
but it doesn't tell you
how to destroy them?

1932
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,557
It's very refreshing, I think,

1933
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:21,061
'cause we all got to do
some a lot more serious stuff.

1934
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:22,729
And it was a real opportunity

1935
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,356
to go deeper with these
characters.

1936
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,232
Are you coming, are you staying?

1937
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,198
I saw you two the other night.

1938
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,825
Ron, that's... that's nothing.

1939
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,120
Ron...

1940
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,873
The scene that I thought
was gonna be really awkward

1941
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,708
and I wasn't sure about at all

1942
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,710
which was us doing our dance.

1943
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,879
- Yeah.
- Like I... now that's one

1944
01:22:47,962 --> 01:22:51,299
of my favorite scenes
from the whole of the series,

1945
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,885
because the level
of familiarity that you and I

1946
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,887
had with each other,
at that point, I didn't think

1947
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,931
I could have done a scene
like that with another actor.

1948
01:22:58,014 --> 01:22:59,641
Well, it's also an
interesting scene 'cause like,

1949
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,518
first of all, we were doing
Harry Potter films.

1950
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:03,436
And then on the last movie,
the director came and was like,

1951
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,563
"Hey, how about you do
slow dancing to Nick Cave"

1952
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,065
"for five minutes?"

1953
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,400
We're like, "Wait,
what movie are we working on?"

1954
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:09,943
Like, "Great, but okay."

1955
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:13,363
<i>♪ I once was blind,

1956

1962
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,468
There's so much said
in the scene.

1963
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,262
It was unspoken. I loved that.

1964
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,597
And also in the same way
that for the characters,

1965
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,307
they got to have
a moment of fun.

1966
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,809
I feel like you and I got
to have a moment of fun.

1967
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,269
- Yeah, certainly.
- Which we also...

1968
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,770
both: Needed at that point.

1969
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,605
- You know?
- Yes, absolutely.

1970
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,734
Treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1971
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,610
There was that, like... that
scene on the last movie

1972
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,446
where it was like us
running through the forest.

1973
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:55,947
We were racing through the woods

1974
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,907
trying not to be caught
by the Snatchers.

1975
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,325
And action.

1976
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,455
Well, don't hang about.
Snatch him.

1977
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,790
Honestly, I remember
you and I, Emma,

1978
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,083
becoming
incredibly competitive...

1979
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,376
Ridiculously competitive.

1980
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,670
About who was gonna run faster.

1981
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:12,464
- Give me five. That rocked!
- Whoo-hoo!

1982
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,215
I feel like
Rupert was always, like,

1983
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,800
a little bit, too, like,
"You guys do what you like."

1984
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,802
He was just like,
"You do your thing."

1985
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:19,054
- Yeah...
- I be here.

1986
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,139
For me, running is a stunt,

1987
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,807
walking is a stunt.

1988
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,145
Oof.

1989
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:30,648
I absolutely do not like

1990
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,442
watching very many scenes
of myself in that,

1991
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:34,235
but I've watched you two
and I think you're brilliant.

1992
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,154
I remember that was a really
sweet thing, though.

1993
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,573
I do actually remember that the
three of us telling each other

1994
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,784
that we were doing a good job
or that we'd done a scene well.

1995
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,869
Especially 'cause we had
started off young

1996
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,370
and really not knowing
what we were doing.

1997
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,997
So that when we'd see
each other do

1998
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,791
like a bit of real acting,
you'd go, "Oh, cool."

1999
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,501
- "That was... that's was cool."
- Yeah, "Well done."

2000
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,960
Like, yeah that was... I guess
we're all getting better.

2001
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,128
- Crushed it.
- Great. Well done.

2002
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,713
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean.

2003
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:58,384
Obviously, us kissing
was the most horrifying thing

2004
01:24:58,468 --> 01:24:59,803
- either of us...
- Oh.

2005
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,096
- Yeah.
- Have ever had to go through.

2006
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,394
I'm Hermione Granger.

2007
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:11,022
And you are?

2008
01:25:11,105 --> 01:25:13,900
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

2009
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:18,321
"It's <i>levi-ohh-sa,</i>
not <i>levio-sahh.</i>"

2010
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,573
(LAUGHTER)
She's a nightmare, honestly.

2011
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,700
No wonder she hasn't got
any friends.

2012
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:26,037
I think she heard you.

2013
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,248
It was just built up so much
for the whole series.

2014
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:29,499
Eight films.

2015
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:31,209
I love Ron
and Hermione's romance

2016
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,878
and the way
that sort of just bubbles away

2017
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,797
under the story constantly.

2018
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,507
Uh... um...

2019
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:39,968
(CLEARS THROAT)

2020
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:46,140
This relationship has been
so restrained for so long.

2021
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,059
Got a bit of toothpaste.

2022
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,564
Slughorn's having
Christmas, too, you know.

2023
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:53,982
And we're meant

they were both comfortable.

"I'm gonna come on set
and watch you guys kiss."

I needed like, momentum into
the kiss in order to do it.

2063

And Rupert's, I could almost
on that first take,

2064
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,988
I saw Rupert's face
explode with surprise,

"It's only the first take."

2178
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,516
especially kind of finishing.

2179
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:27,184
I felt like I lost track

2180
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:29,353
of who I was
and who the character was.

2181
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,023
I didn't really know
where they ended or began.

2182
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,441
Yeah, there were some things
that I'm just like,

2183
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:34,483
who... who am I?

2184
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:35,568
Like, what do I like to do?

2185
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:36,986
What... what is important to me?

2186
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:38,279

2187
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:39,572
Even my name
didn't feel like my name.

2188
01:33:39,655 --> 01:33:40,906
- Yeah.
- I felt I only

2189
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,199
really knew how to do one thing.

2190
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:43,617
- Yeah.
- I knew how to play Ron.

2191
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:45,077
Ron was my favorite character,

2192
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:47,371
so it was so cool
being him in the film.

2193
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:48,873
It's almost like we did

the most extreme form
of method acting.

2195

one of the last shots

We were diving past the camera

That was what it all
came down to, this one take.

It was such a metaphor for
what was actually happening.

2234

were, like, utterly devastated.

2243

I think it was the first time
we'd allowed ourselves

2244
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:20,691
to even process
or realize we'd done it.

2245

We'd made it through.

It's so ingrained in me as well,

like I measure
my life with these movies.

it's a really important part

2252
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,048

like, a part of their identity,

it, yeah,
it just makes you really proud.

that makes life richer.

Like, when things get really
dark and times are really hard,

2258
01:36:55,726 --> 01:36:58,062
stories give us places we can go

2259
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:02,650
where we can rest and feel held.

2260
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:04,401
I don't think I fully
appreciated the reach

2261
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:06,862
that these films had
when we were in them.

2262
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,572
The amount of people
that have said things like,

2263

"These are the only films
my dad and I watched together."

2264

"Like, we can't talk
about anything else."

"And like,
we watch Harry Potter together."

"And that has been our thing."

a small kind of part of that.

relive on, finding new mediums,

profoundly therapeutic

2295
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,690
and good about it, is it's made

feel lonely,

besides the incredible
imagination of worlds

2308
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:03,520
and characters
that Jo Rowling created

2309
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:06,857
was the fact that you get
to see young children

the escapism you find.

The healthy form of escapism.

2319

That, I think, is kind of
what Harry Potter does.

01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,994
So you could be watching it
in 50 years' time, easy.

2333
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,082
I'll not be here, sadly, but...
(LAUGHS)

2334
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,585
Don't you think on it
for one minute.

2335
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,547
But Hagrid will, yes.

2336
01:40:13,006 --> 01:40:16,135
Kinda looking back at it now,

2337
01:40:16,218 --> 01:40:17,636
just really fond memories.

2338
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,139
I think about it a lot.
It was a great time.

2339
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:22,182
It really was, it was...

2340
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,976
it was amazing.

2341
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:28,689
Just the best,
most amazing experience.

2342
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:32,192
And I can't
really explain to you...

2343
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:34,486
like, they're such good people.

2344
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,947
They were so kind, and...

2345
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:40,200
they both took the
responsibility very seriously.

2346
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:44,246
And I appreciated that so much.

2347
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:45,664
It really is like family.

2348
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:48,584
We're just
so intrinsically linked.

2349
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:51,795
They're very important
people to me.

2350
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,965
The crew on these films
were unbelievable.

2351
01:40:55,048 --> 01:40:58,677
There are people
on these films that are...

2352
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:03,557
are foundational to who I am...

2353
01:41:06,059 --> 01:41:09,313
As a person and an actor.

2354
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:11,315
I feel so lucky to be where I am

2355
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,067
and to have the life that I have

2356
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,861
and be able to work with
the people I work with now,

2357
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:20,032
but none of it is possible
without this.

2358
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:24,578
So yeah, it was... it was very...

2359
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:26,622
it was a very good ten years.
