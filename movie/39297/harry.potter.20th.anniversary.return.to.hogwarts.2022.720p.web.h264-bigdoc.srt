2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,967
Thanks.

3
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:39,305
Yeah, so I'll be
watching the game...

4
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:40,116
What?

5
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:46,497
Hi!

6
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,525
<i>He couldn't know
that, at this very moment,</i>

7
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,695
<i>people meeting in secret
all over the country</i>

8
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:27,241
<i>were holding up their glasses
and saying in hushed voices,</i>

9
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:31,996
<i>"To Harry Potter,
the boy who lived."</i>

10
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,379
- Dan.
- Hey, man.

11
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:41,797
It's great to see you.

12
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,299
- How you doing, dude?
- How are you, mate?

13
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:46,427
It's so nice to see you.
This is awesome.

14
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,262
- This is incredible.
- Yeah, it is.

15
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:50,306
Last time we were here,
you were shorter.

16
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,350
I'm just...
just very, very slightly.

17
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,727
That's kind of you to say.

18
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,562
- Here we are.
- 20 years down the road.

19
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,356
- Yeah.
- It's kind of odd.

20
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,774
How did it come to you?
Like, I never...

21
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,275
I would never
get to ask this question.

22
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,610
Like, how did you end up
doing "Harry Potter"?

23
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:03,694
I ended up doing it

24
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:04,904
because my daughter Eleanor

25
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:06,572
convinced me to read the books

26
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,449
after I refused three times.

27
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,409
So once "Prisoner of Azkaban"
came out, I said...

28
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:11,911
Thank you, Eleanor.

29
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:15,122
I said, "Okay,
I'll read these, finally."

30
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:17,208
And then immediately,
I saw the movies.

31
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,627
I just saw them.
And that hasn't happened since.

32
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,422
Then I had to fly to Edinburgh
to meet Jo Rowling

33
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:27,051
and essentially said,
"This is my vision."

34
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,428
She said, "That's exactly
the way I see the movie."

35
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:30,971
<i>When the books came out,</i>

36
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,140
the queues of kids
around the block...

37
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,268
I mean, thousands of them
all waiting for the latest one.

38
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,067
So many people were beginning
to fall in love

39
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,777
with JK Rowling's writing.

40
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,655
I think I probably would have
been about eight years old.

41
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,782
I think that's when
the first one came out.

42
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,951
<i>It became, like,
our family thing.</i>

43
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,619
My dad used to do
all the voices,

44
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,497
<i>and my brother and I
just became obsessed.</i>

45
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,707
We would just beg him
to keep going.

46
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,084
And every time
he finished a chapter,

47
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,585
we'd be like, "One more,
one more, please.

48
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,087
"Just one more.
Please, please, please.

49
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,296
One more, one more,
one more, one more."

50
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,673
<i>A friend of mine at school</i>

51
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,466
<i>had the first two.</i>

52
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,427
And I went for a sleepover
at his house and he said,

53
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,637
"Well, 'Philosopher's Stone'
is there on the bookshelf."

54
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,181
<i>That's what we did
the whole sleepover.</i>

55
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,766
<i>We just both sat there
in silence,</i>

56
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,143
him reading
"Chamber of Secrets,"

57
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:18,644
me reading
"Philosopher's Stone."

58
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:20,146
And that was it, really.
I never looked back.

59
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,814
<i>At the time of reading,</i>

60
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:23,482
we instantly related
to Fred and George

61
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,192
because there aren't
many twins in literature.

62
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,986
<i>"The Chamber of Secrets"
was the first book</i>

63
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,989
that I sort of genuinely
stayed up at night reading.

64
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:34,118
The writing was so vivid,
the characters so relatable.

65
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:39,331
It was such a intricately,
perfectly designed universe.

66
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:41,500
I think it's very easy
to forget that, at the time,

67
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,419
people were talking about,
like, the death of reading.

68
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,172
I just think it's a beautiful
creative outlook on life,

69
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:48,466
this belief
in limitless possibilities.

70
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,135
<i>One of the many reasons
I admired JK so much</i>

71
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,637
<i>is that millions
would now read books</i>

72
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,890
<i>who would never have lifted
a book up in their lives.</i>

73
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:59,185
And you suddenly realize
the power of writing.

74
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,519
Hip, hip, Harry!

75
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,229
And then in terms of casting,

76
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:06,901
it was... the search
for Harry Potter was insane.

77
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:09,528
The new "Harry Potter" film
are looking for children

78
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:13,949
to play the three main roles in
the multi-million-pound film.

79
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,703
I remember going to the...
the very first audition,

80
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:20,956
and there was hundreds
if not thousands of people.

81
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,291
<i>And then we realized that</i>

82
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,751
we were the only set
of twins there

83
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,169
who weren't wearing
identical clothing.

84
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:27,046
So we ended up
going over the road

85
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:30,341
and bought two identical
matching tops.

86
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,051
- Just off the rack.
- Just off the rack.

87
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:33,135
We were like,
"Right, they will do."

88
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,720
And then off we went.

89
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:37,598
They'd let us all mill,
you know, sort of congregate

90
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,558
till they "seemingly"
walked away,

91
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:41,227
and, of course, while there's
still one gentleman

92
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,896
holding a boom mic
straight over our heads.

93
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,067
And this little girl
asked me, "What's that?"

94
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,320
I think I even said,
"It's a mic, duh."

95
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,613
I was like,
"They're filming us.

96
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,073
This is just, like, a trick."

97
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,824
Like, as if I'd done it
before, really.

98
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,576
And I remember it,
'cause it was Emma.

99
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,161
I became completely gripped

100
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,373
by the excitement
around this audition.

101
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:05,751
<i>And I always knew
that I was going for Hermione</i>

102
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,586
<i>in a way that I think
terrified my parents</i>

103
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,296
<i>because they were like,</i>

104
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,174
"What are we gonna do with her
if she doesn't get the part?"

105
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,342
I was just excited.

106
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:14,677
I wasn't sort of daunted.

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,262
I wasn't thinking,
"I wonder how many

108
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:17,680
films they're gonna make,"
anything like that.

109
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,181
I thought,
"Oh, this will be fun."

110
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,141
I think the biggest pressure
at the beginning

111
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:22,560
was who was gonna be
Harry Potter.

112
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:23,978
We couldn't find Harry.

113
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,105
We couldn't...
we just couldn't find Harry,

114
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:27,731
and it was getting
kind of weird,

115
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,108
um, and panicky.

116
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:32,695
I was in my hotel room
in London one night

117
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,030
watching the BBC version
of "David Copperfield."

118
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,782
<i>Immediately, a light bulb
went off in my head,</i>

119
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,742
<i>and I said,
"This is Harry Potter."</i>

120
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,579
<i>This is the kid we've been
looking for for months.</i>

121
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:43,289
So I asked
the casting director,

122
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,457
I said, "We've gotta get him
in here for an audition."

123
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,126
She said,
"It's never gonna happen.

124
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:50,087
"His parents do not want him
involved in this world.

125
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,630
They don't want him
to take this role."

126
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,465
I think the deal
was to sign on for, like,

127
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,676
all seven films and they would
be filmed in LA.

128
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,386
So Mum and Dad were like,
"No, that's, like,

129
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,013
a huge disruption to his life."

130
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:01,473
Fortunately, David Heyman,

131
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,143
uh, went to the theater
a few weeks later.

132
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:05,978
These two guys
in the row in front of me

133
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,479
started sort of turning round.

134
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,607
<i>David, being the great
producer that he is,</i>

135
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,485
convinced Dan's father to bring
Dan in for an audition.

136
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:17,448
And that's basically
when we got our Harry Potter.

137
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,033
And action.

138
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,826
- That's a dragon egg.
- What is it?

139
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,661
- That's what that is.
- What is that?

140
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:23,787
A dragon egg.

141
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:24,955
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,332
I was a very happy kid who had

143
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:28,334
a really haunted quality,
apparently.

144
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,836
"You're really sweet,
but you looked like

145
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,172
you had real, like,
stuff going on."

146
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:36,175
It was very emotional,
actually, seeing this kid

147
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,093
sitting there talking,
and I just thought,

148
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,179
"Yeah, that's him.
Thank God we found him."

149
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:43,515
Rupert and Emma
were very easy to cast

150
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,434
because they felt like
they jumped off the page.

151
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,186
<i>We screen-tested
the three of them together</i>

152
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,188
<i>to make sure that
they all had this chemistry,</i>

153
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,857
which immediately was obvious
in the first screen test.

154
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,817
Remember, guys,
get closer to her

155
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,569
as she finds out
the information.

156
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:57,154
And action.

157
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,699
I never thought
to look in here.

158
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,036
I checked this out first term
for a bit of light reading.

159
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,705
- This is light?
- Shut up.

160
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,500
If Filch comes around
the corner any second now,

161
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,503
at least 50 points
off Gryffindor.

162
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,175
I knew it! Here it is.

163
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:20,719
Nicholas Flamel
is the only known

164
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,722
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

165
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,224
The what?

166
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:27,893
Oh, honestly,
don't you two read?

167
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:30,020
Cut. Good job.

168
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,189
It's lovely seeing you.

169
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:34,191
Yeah, this is surreal,
isn't it?

170
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:37,027
How do we all feel being back
and talking about this?

171
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,155
Well, A, really emotional,
obviously.

172
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,200
And B, um, it feels like
no time has passed

173
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:46,370
and loads of time has passed
simultaneously.

174
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:47,955
Yeah, kind of much the same.
It's quite surreal.

175
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,165
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

176
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,001
It doesn't feel like we've
kind of earned a reunion yet.

177
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,378
- Yeah.
- I know.

178
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,505
I have had kidney stones
and a baby,

179
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:57,923
so time has obviously passed.

180
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,842
- You did mention that.
- I feel my age.

181
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,886
But there is, like,
such a collection

182
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,763
of, like, shared memories
and stuff

183
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,265
that we just all did together
that it is

184
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:07,933
immediately
very easy to be, like...

185
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,601
to sort of slip back
into where you were.

186
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,146
Our first audition, the...
the day we all met...

187
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:14,023
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- I think for the first time,

188
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,774
there was, like, me walking
out of my dressing room

189
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,735
and seeing, like,
another, like,

190
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,611
young, brown-haired boy
going the other way.

191
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:20,988
I never saw his face,
but I was like,

192
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,281
"You are clearly another Harry

193
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:23,782
that is being
tested out today."

194
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,367
- And they were, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,952
Testing us with various
different configurations

196
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:28,036
of Ron, Harry, and Hermione.

197
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,455
I remember there was one

198
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:31,248
where they put all
the three of us together.

199
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:34,084
I do remember that
when it was the three of us,

200
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:36,920
- something felt different...
- Right. Yeah.

201
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,631
And, like, right and easy.
I do remember the click.

202
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,425
<i>We'd been out
at the studios.</i>

203
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,844
They'd told us we got the parts
and they were like, "Cool.

204
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,679
"So we're announcing
you've got the parts.

205
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,474
There is now going to be a lot
of media outside your house."

206
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,725
So you can't go home."

207
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,185
So far, it's sort of

208
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:54,062
turned things upside down.

209
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,482
Um, it's... I don't know,

210
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,276
I've never had anything
happen to me like this before.

211
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,321
Hermione made
complete sense to me.

212
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:03,947
<i>That's me.</i>

213
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,657
<i>Like, I am that girl.</i>

214
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:09,661
Well, Emma was arguably
the smartest person on the set,

215
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,246
and I'm talking
about everybody.

216
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,707
She just was...
she was a brilliant kid.

217
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,210
I think I'm scarily
like my character.

218
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:21,006
'Cause I live in a family
of, um, seven

219
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:23,217
and, um, I've got
a redheaded sister

220
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,593
and I live in a burrow.

221
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,095
Rupert is just the most
camera-ready

222
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,681
12-year-old boy in the world
at that point.

223
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:34,228
Like, he was so,
like, just fearless.

224
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:37,356
Rupert was Ron, you know,

225
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,775
and Dan kind of was Harry.

226
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:42,027
How do you feel
about becoming famous?

227
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,446
It'd be cool.

228
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,948
We were all talking about this,

229
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,534
how comfortable you made us all
in our auditions

230
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,785
and how, like, this, like,

231
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,912
extended massively
into the set.

232
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:54,706
My memory of it is that
it seemed effortless to you.

233
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,001
Well, on the first film,
I was dying the entire time,

234
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,878
but I just... I always believe

235
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,755
you cannot bring
that kind of anxiety.

236
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,590
I want everyone
to feel comfortable.

237
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:05,300
I want everyone
to feel like it's a family.

238
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,219
I want everyone
to feel like they're home.

239
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:30,033
Hey, class, listen to me.

240
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,618
Welcome to your first
flying lesson.

241
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:34,246
I want you to raise your hand
over the broom.

242
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:36,206
For the first several weeks
on the film,

243
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,877
the kids
are basically in shock.

244
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,588
<i>Looking back, I am sort
of amazed at the fact</i>

245
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,798
<i>that I wasn't ever, like,
completely overwhelmed by it.</i>

246
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:46,884
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Dan, when you turn away

247
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,094
from her this time...
when you turn away,

248
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:50,596
grab hold of this,

249
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,723
and look up like you're
going to get it, okay?

250
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,766
<i>But I also think
that was, again, part of Chris</i>

251
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,226
and the whole crew just, like,

252
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,853
they kept us having fun
the whole time.

253
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,938
Obviously, we were just kids,
and we were all

254
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:02,024
looking forward
to mucking about together.

255
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,151
<i>Chris Columbus
made the atmosphere</i>

256
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,819
<i>very much like a funfair.</i>

257
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:09,239
We were very much just, like,
kids being kids on a set.

258
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:10,741
- Mm-hmm.
- My residing memory

259
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:13,160
from the first...
from "Philosopher's Stone"

260
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:14,953
is I just learned
how to play slam.

261
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:17,372
You know what we did a lot of
as well was that game.

262
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,665
- Oh, my God.
- Slaps.

263
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:20,125
- So much hand slaps.
- Oh, slaps.

264
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,543
With, like, all of us,
like, red...

265
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,295
like, red, raw hands
from, like,

266
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,796
- hitting each other really hard.
- I think we also upgraded

267
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,965
- to knuckles as well.
- Oh, and shins.

268
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,383
- Yeah.
- I remember the shin version.

269
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,218
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

270
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:33,972
Sorry. Gotta give it back.

271
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,683
I am the champion!

272
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,311
They probably made their jobs
harder for themselves

273
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,146
by letting us have
as much fun as we had

274
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,773
because it distracted us from,

275
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,399
you know, the work
we were supposed to be doing.

276
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,235
And for the other viewers,
get a mousetrap.

277
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,695
Darling, don't put it
on your nose.

278
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,072
You're gonna remove
all your makeup.

279
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,782
Like, a big problem
was, like,

280
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:54,993
throughout a take,
our attention would, like...

281
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,204
would wane and come and go.

282
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,164
<i>They'd say a line and then
they'd smile at the camera</i>

283
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,833
where they were just so happy
to be in a Harry Potter film

284
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,378
<i>that they couldn't contain
their excitement long enough</i>

285
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,338
<i>to focus on an entire scene.</i>

286
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:07,923
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

287
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,884
Columbus had worked
with kids a lot.

288
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:12,928
And he was terrific with them.
He really was.

289
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,514
He used to go down on his knees
to talk to them

290
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:18,016
and huddle around
so nobody could hear.

291
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,559
He was such a dad as well.

292
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,103
Like, and I... you could
really feel that,

293
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,855
like you were kind of
part of his family.

294
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,191
Be a little looser with this.

295
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,276
And just be talking,
you know what I'm saying?

296
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,569
- Yeah.
- You go up and you're, like,

297
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:31,405
frozen like this,
but you can be...

298
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:32,823
"You really think"...

299
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,908
"Of course I can use it,"
like this, okay?

300
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:36,702
- Yeah.
- Good job, though.

301
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,370
But it's not easy,
'cause it takes a tremendous

302
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,539
amount of patience with kids,

303
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:43,625
particularly with...
with kids as hyperactive

304
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,043
and as excitable
as we all were.

305
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,964
- Looking great.
- Well, they wanted to...

306
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,465
Fancy seeing you boys here.

307
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,093
- Hi.
- Snuck away.

308
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:54,845
A couple of Gryffindors
just kicking it.

309
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,722
- Come here.
- Good to see you, brother.

310
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:01,018
How did Chris Columbus stay
is such good... good spirits?

311
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:03,061
We sort of ran around.
I guess we were all, like, 11.

312
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,355
You might get, like, three
people to do the right thing.

313
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:06,815
But it doesn't mean you're
gonna get the other five

314
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,275
in the background
doing the right thing.

315
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,776
No. No. And Rupert
was... was relentless.

316
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,403
Once he started...
once the flood gate open...

317
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:13,155
- God, yeah.
- But that's the thing.

318
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,740
That's the way it worked,
wasn't it?

319
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:16,074
'Cause Columbus basically just

320
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:17,576
- let us be kids.
- Yeah. True.

321
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,453
I never recall feeling
like we were working.

322
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,079
But that's so important,
isn't it, that we had that...

323
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:22,581
Yeah. I think that's why
it feels that way

324
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:23,874
when you watch it.
It feels like...

325
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,417
- Yeah. That's true.
- Kids.

326
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,752
I tell you what's funny
about that, though, is...

327
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,420
is being surrounded
by all the...

328
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,797
the cream of the, um,
the British acting industry

329
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:32,883
and not having a clue
who anyone is.

330
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,801
I thought... I thought
Richard Harris worked here

331
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:36,970
as like... as a tour guide
for a while.

332
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:43,727
<i>I don't think any of
the kids had the capability</i>

333
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,479
of understanding the gravity

334
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,397
of who they were
dealing with at the time.

335
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:50,025
That was no stranger
Hagrid met in the village.

336
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,777
It was Snape, which means

337
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,820
he knows how to get past
Fluffy.

338
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,322
And with Dumbledore gone...

339
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,823
Good afternoon.

340
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:59,451
<i>The British royalty
of the acting world.</i>

341
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,036
<i>What have you got to say
for yourself?</i>

342
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,704
<i>I swear I don't know
how it happened!</i>

343
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,082
<i>When I think of the people
that I got to</i>

344
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:08,418
just grow up around
and hear... hear them interact

345
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:11,004
and hear the quickness
of people.

346
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,548
<i>The adult actors came in</i>

347
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,634
and were, like, the mischief
in a funny way.

348
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,429
That's actually great.

349
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:20,972
Like Robbie Coltrane.

350
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,099
He was such a kid.

351
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:23,975
Like, so immature

352
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,479
and, like, just so much fun.

353
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:28,730
He loved making us laugh,

354
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,607
and he was
incredibly good at it.

355
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,859
I've tried
absolutely everything.

356
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:35,529
I've tried creams.
I've tried jellies.

357
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:36,988
I tried shaving.

358
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,865
Every moment...
I woke up, it's like...

359
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,118
my husband is threatening
to leave me.

360
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:42,661
If he really loved me,

361
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:45,038
he wouldn't mind a little
facial hair, I'm sure.

362
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:47,499
But he's being very,
very difficult.

363
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:53,004
That, like, kindness
and that warmth from you...

364
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,340
- Aww.
- It made all the difference.

365
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:57,175
Well, we spent
so much time together.

366
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,386
I know. I know.
I spent more time with you

367
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,179
than I did with my own
children at one point.

368
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:02,264
I know. Wild.

369
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,890
Ooh. I know.

370
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,725
I think most of my
favorite scenes, if I'm honest,

371
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,146
looking back, are with you
and the gang in Hagrid's hut.

372
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:11,106
I keep thinking
about that scene

373
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:12,691
- where I get called a mudblood.
- Yes.

374
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,985
And you were so sweet
with me that day.

375
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,195
'Cause it was, like, my first,
like, you know,

376
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,613
big piece of acting.

377
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:24,578
He called me a mudblood.

378
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:27,038
He did not.

379
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,373
What's a mudblood?

380
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:30,292
It means dirty blood.

381
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,211
Mudblood's a really foul name
for someone who is Muggle-born.

382
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:36,631
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

383
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,842
The three of you have become
such great actors.

384
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:40,260
Being on that set,

385
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,429
you felt like you actually
entered the world.

386
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:43,680
Yeah.

387
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,182
With all of Stuart Craig's
sets,

388
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,683
the attention to detail
was phenomenal.

389
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:54,733
I was always adamant
that Hogwarts shouldn't feel

390
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:58,987
as if it's a world
that couldn't exist in reality.

391
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,239
<i>I had a tremendous amount
of creative freedom,</i>

392
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:04,576
<i>so we could build this world
from the ground up.</i>

393
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,454
<i>Some of the sets on "Potter"
were overwhelming to me,</i>

394
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,039
<i>and I'd been doing it
for 35 years.</i>

395
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:10,415
You know? "Oh, blimey."

396
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:13,084
The very first time
I visited the set,

397
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,961
they walked me through
the Great Hall,

398
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:18,256
which was mind-blowing.

399
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,759
<i>All the floors
are real Yorkstone.</i>

400
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,928
<i>A lot of those scenes
with 250 extras,</i>

401
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,804
<i>they're all about 18
and trampling 'round.</i>

402
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:26,514
<i>You're not gonna put
a plastic floor down.</i>

403
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,308
<i>It's gotta be the real stuff.</i>

404
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:30,936
<i>And all these lit candles
going up and down on wires.</i>

405
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,646
<i>One of my favorite
moments on set ever</i>

406
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:34,272
<i>was the moment
when all the floating candles</i>

407
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:35,982
started burning through
the ropes that tied them

408
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,609
to the ceiling
and just started falling

409
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,945
- around the Great Hall.
- Hundreds of real candles

410
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,738
- that were really lit...
- "Oh, my God."

411
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:44,783
On fishing line
from the ceiling.

412
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,618
So much of that would
be visual effects now.

413
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,203
The fact that we got
to actually be on that set...

414
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,955
Actually, that's so true.
That's so cool.

415
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:51,498
- Thank you, Stuart Craig.
- Yeah.

416
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,124
- Yeah.
- We love you, Stuart Craig.

417
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,387
<i>The hardest scene to shoot
was Quidditch.</i>

418
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,638
And the audience had to

419
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:08,139
understand the rules
immediately.

420
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,684
Quidditch is easy enough
to understand.

421
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:14,312
Each team has seven players:
three chasers, two beaters,

422
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,982
one keeper,
and the seeker... that's you.

423
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:20,360
So Jo Rowling basically did
a rule book for us.

424
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:21,736
A Quidditch rule book

425
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,990
explaining every detail
of the game.

426
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:26,950
<i>Then, with Stuart Craig,
our production designer,</i>

427
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,160
<i>designed the look
of the Quidditch pitch</i>

428
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:34,165
<i>and really create a pitch
that felt authentic and real</i>

429
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,168
<i>for a game
that is completely unreal.</i>

430
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:40,171
Lots of energy, enthusiasm.

431
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:41,673
Set and action!

432
00:20:41,756 --> 00:20:44,634
- She scores!
- Angelina Johnson scores!

433
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:46,428
Ten points for Gryffindor.

434
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,679
I always wanted
to tell you this,

435
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,097
but there was a moment,
you know,

436
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,473
on day two maybe or three,

437
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:53,184
the camera pushes into you
and you say,

438
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,728
"We're not going home,
not really."

439
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:58,315
Feels strange to be
going home, doesn't it?

440
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,567
I'm not going home.

441
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,485
Not really.

442
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,154
I got tears...
I still get tears in my eyes

443
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,531
thinking about it.
I thought, "This guy...

444
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,533
this kid is an amazing actor."

445
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,785
- Oh, that's...
- And it was that moment

446
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,996
that kind of opened up
the whole world for us.

447
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,749
And the first film was very
storybook, very inviting.

448
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,042
Yeah, it's lovely and...

449
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,418
It's like,
"Welcome to Hogwarts."

450
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:19,878
Until you get to the end
of the movie.

451
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,504
And where a man...
I melt a man's face.

452
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:22,881
Yes, exactly.

453
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,804
- The first film was a hit.
- Yep.

454
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,432
So once it became a hit
and people accepted

455
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:33,725
not only the film

456
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:35,226
- but accepted the cast...
- Right, yeah.

457
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,853
I had a ball
on the second film,

458
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:39,356
"The Chamber of Secrets,"
'cause I was, like, free.

459
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:06,341
Okay, come on. Shh, shh.

460
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,967
Okay, come on.

461
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:10,553
Shh, come on.

462
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:14,265
Morning, Weasleys.

463
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:15,934
Morning, Dad.

464
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:19,229
I always loved any scene
where the kind of Weasleys

465
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:20,772
were together,
like the Burrow scenes.

466
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,440
<i>It just had
this frenetic energy.</i>

467
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:25,276
<i>Everyone kind of played
off each other.</i>

468
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,278
The thing about the Burrow
as I remember is that

469
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:28,571
it changed all the time.

470
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:30,240
It sort of expanded
and contracted.

471
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:33,076
One minute, there was a huge
fireplace of floo powder

472
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,371
and then there was just...
and then it got smaller.

473
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:39,165
Yeah, it was like a living,
breathing set that changed.

474
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:40,500
I feel like being a Weasley

475
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,085
is the best part
of being in Harry Potter.

476
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,504
We had, like, our Hogwarts
family but I felt, like,

477
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:47,090
so special having
an actual extra family.

478
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:48,675
- It was great.
- All these scenes that we got

479
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:49,968
on top of everything else.

480
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,761
Julie's brilliant
to work with.

481
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:55,098
We used to... Ron would say,
"Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy."

482
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:57,725
Julie Walters who played
my mother, Mrs. Weasley,

483
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,603
was... was just so wonderful
and brilliant to me.

484
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,647
<i>She really kind of took me
under her wing</i>

485
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,024
and she just was, like,
the perfect mother figure.

486
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,652
<i>The twins were two people
that I was really close with.</i>

487
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,654
They really were like
older brothers.

488
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:11,823
<i>Julie Walters
and Mark Williams,</i>

489
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:13,533
<i>they were like
my second family.</i>

490
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:15,034
They were always kind of
staying in character

491
00:23:15,118 --> 00:23:16,828
and they would have
this kind of...

492
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,371
they would
bounce off each other.

493
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:20,540
Dumbled... dom... mith.

494
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,333
Who? Who, dear?

495
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,335
Dumbledore must know
you're here, Harry.

496
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,213
Cut.

497
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:28,923
Stop, stop.

498
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,675
This isn't working.

499
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:31,843
Can't believe it.

500
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:33,386
- You guys look great.
- Hello.

501
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,929
How are you?
This is amazing.

502
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,181
- How're you guys doing?
- Very well, thank you.

503
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,640
- How are you?
- Good.

504
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:39,350
- This is so exciting.
- Yeah.

505
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,768
It's the first time
I've been back since "Azkaban."

506
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,520
We didn't know
you were gonna come back.

507
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:46,357
<i>The Weasley family values
were consideration,</i>

508
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,985
thoughtfulness, and fun!

509
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:52,489
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

510
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:56,201
Tell me, what exactly is
the function of a rubber duck?

511
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:58,828
<i>It's just very natural
when we were all together.</i>

512
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,998
It was a family,
you know, in all but name.

513
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,625
That's the cool thing about
it as well is that you see

514
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,669
that... that motion
where they are very inclusive

515
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,881
and then you see the complete
opposite with the Malfoys.

516
00:24:09,964 --> 00:24:11,966
Yeah, it's always such
a good comparison,

517
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,301
the two families side by side.

518
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,053
A real chalk and cheese
side of it.

519
00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:17,889
Not now, Draco. Play nicely.

520
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,227
Mr. Potter.

521
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,771
Lucius Malfoy.

522
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,523
We meet at last.

523
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,024
I was first aware
of Harry Potter

524
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,567
because everybody
was reading the books

525
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,486
on the tube everywhere I went.

526
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,238
<i>I'm convinced I ended up
playing Lucius</i>

527
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:34,822
<i>because I didn't want to.</i>

528
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,449
<i>I went to audition
for Gilderoy Lockhart</i>

529
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,076
<i>and Chris said,
"That was great.</i>

530
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,744
<i>Would you mind reading
a different part?"</i>

531
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:41,955
I was about to play
Captain Hook in "Peter Pan"

532
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:43,248
and I thought,
"Well, I don't wanna play

533
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,749
two children's villains."

534
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:47,377
<i>And I read
through gritted teeth.</i>

535
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,920
<i>I was deeply bitter,</i>

536
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:51,214
and, of course, that's exactly
what was necessary,

537
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:54,592
and they asked me to play
Lucius, and thank God they did.

538
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,594
How dare you?

539
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:58,805
<i>The point of him
being in the story to me</i>

540
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,850
was to explain why Draco
was such a horrible,

541
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,061
<i>heartless,
sadistic bully at school.</i>

542
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:07,981
Red hair
and a hand-me-down robe?

543
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:10,233
You must be a Weasley.

544
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:12,360
He's a product
of his parents, Draco,

545
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:15,446
<i>and he's got
really bad parents.</i>

546
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,240
If Hagrid
was your first influence,

547
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:18,616
chances are, you're gonna be...

548
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,118
"All right there, mate."

549
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:21,661
You're gonna be lovely
and... and very huggy.

550
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:24,330
Isn't he beautiful?
Oh, bless him.

551
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:27,750
Look, he knows his mummy.

552
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,627
Ooh!

553
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:32,297
If your dad is a psychopath

554
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,841
wielding a cobra cane about,

555
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,135
you're probably not gonna be
the friendliest geezer.

556
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,512
37, take one.
Camera mark.

557
00:25:39,596 --> 00:25:43,683
Tom, remember, slow.
You're telling a tale.

558
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:47,312
But sinister, soft.
Set and action.

559
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:49,647
<i>I adored Tom
from the second I met him.</i>

560
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,609
He was always just
the biggest sweetheart.

561
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,320
Working with Jason
was a real treat.

562
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,865
In fact, working with Jason
was not always a treat.

563
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:03,369
Just immediately turned
into the most unfriendly,

564
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,580
horrible person I've ever met.

565
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:08,374
<i>I just remember grabbing him
and... and just being</i>

566
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:10,209
<i>as unpleasant
as I possibly could</i>

567
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:13,171
and watching his little face
constantly seeking my approval.

568
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,923
The very first scene
that I shot was actually cut

569
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,508
and is on the deleted scenes.

570
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,802
<i>Draco touched something,
and I used this cane</i>

571
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:20,970
<i>and I went...</i>

572
00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:23,514
Don't touch anything, Draco.

573
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,642
But I didn't know
how sharp the teeth were

574
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,769
and they went right
into little Tom's hands

575
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,189
and he looked up at me
and his eyes welled with tears.

576
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:32,690
Yes, Father.

577
00:26:32,774 --> 00:26:34,609
And I went, "Tom, I'm so
sorry, I didn't realize

578
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:36,402
how sharp they were
and how heavy it was."

579
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:38,029
And he went,
"No, no, it's all right.

580
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:39,155
It was good for the scene."

581
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:40,698
He'd be this evil father,

582
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:42,241
<i>and then they'd say, "Cut."</i>

583
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,868
And he'll come and give you
a cuddle and say,

584
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,703
"Oh, did I hit you too hard?
Did I hit you too hard?"

585
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,706
He's a real, you know,
Jekyll and Hyde, that one.

586
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,836
Yeah! Yeah!

587
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,756
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

588
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,966
Harry Potter.

589
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,760
Such an honor it is.

590
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:02,553
I remember saying
to a friend,

591
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:06,307
"You know, I've got this part.
It's an elf in Harry Potter."

592
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:12,146
And the squeals of joy
and the complete despair

593
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,316
at my not understanding,
you know,

594
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,652
how important
this character was.

595
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,573
We did a take and he goes,

596
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,534
"Thank you, this will be all,"
and I swung my leg out,

597
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,577
and I stepped down
and I swung my stick,

598
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,162
and Chris goes, "Cut.

599
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,081
Can we clean the floor
where Jason slipped, please?"

600
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:31,833
And I said,
"No, I didn't slip."

601
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,418
He said, "Well, what happened?"

602
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:35,837
And I said, "I kicked Dobby
down the stairs."

603
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,178
And I just thought,
"This is gonna be

604
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,514
ridiculously good fun."

605
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:48,933
Mr. Malfoy.

606
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:51,519
Mr. Malfoy!

607
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:54,063
I have something of yours.

608
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:57,650
The sock is pathetic,
isn't it, on one level?

609
00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:59,819
<i>But on another level,
it's everything,</i>

610
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:03,281
<i>and that's, I think,
the beauty of the character.</i>

611
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:06,659
Master has given Dobby
a sock?

612
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:08,828
What? I didn't g...

613
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:12,957
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

614
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,960
Dobby is free.

615
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:18,004
One of the major themes
is this alliance

616
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,506
of friends who endure.

617
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,815
So you and I had one of
our greatest laughs together...

618
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,358
- Yes.
- With Richard Harris.

619
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:42,403
<i>And we had
a animatronic version</i>

620
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,738
<i>of Fawkes the phoenix</i>

621
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:45,531
and it was this bird...
big, red bird

622
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:46,991
- that doesn't exist in life.
- That does not exist.

623
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:48,701
It's not...
it wasn't unrealistic.

624
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,369
Like, it could, I guess.

625
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:54,040
<i>Richard came in and looked
at the phoenix and said,</i>

626
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:57,168
"Wow, they train these animals
marvelously these days."

627
00:28:57,251 --> 00:28:58,961
<i>'Cause they had a camera
inside the eyes,</i>

628
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:00,838
<i>so they could see
Richard looking at it,</i>

629
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,256
<i>and then they were like,</i>

630
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,634
<i>"Well, we don't wanna
break the spell,</i>

631
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:06,469
so we'll just keep the bird
reacting and moving."

632
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:08,429
And then that, of course,
you know, got into a cycle

633
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,515
where Richard was like,
"The bird is responding to me."

634
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:14,727
Ah, fascinating creatures,
phoenixes.

635
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:18,189
They can carry
immensely heavy loads,

636
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:21,651
and their... their tears
have healing powers.

637
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:23,194
- We never told him.
- No, we never told him.

638
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:24,320
- No.
- He just thought it was

639
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:25,738
- a real bird.
- Yeah.

640
00:29:25,822 --> 00:29:27,323
It was insane
that we were part of that.

641
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,075
You know, I do not know
of another human being

642
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:30,660
that could have started
the series in the way you did.

643
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:32,119
Well, that...
that makes me feel great.

644
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,454
I've always felt guilty
about leaving.

645
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,872
- I really did.
- Don't.

646
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,458
When I said goodbye
to you guys, I was like,

647
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,544
"I can't believe
I'm leaving these guys."

648
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,379
And I think you honestly...
I don't think you ever

649
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:44,298
get enough credit for, like,
what you achieved

650
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,425
on those first two
and with all of us,

651
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:47,969
and so thank you
so much for that.

652
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,721
It's been the greatest
experience of my life.

653
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,811
<i>You fail to recognize
that it matters not</i>

654
00:29:56,894 --> 00:30:00,106
<i>what someone is born...</i>

655
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:03,067
<i>but what they grow to be.</i>

656
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:14,495
Hello.

657
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:19,917
Oh, thank you for coming.

658
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,502
Thanks for chatting.

659
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,632
Who is that? That man.

660
00:30:26,716 --> 00:30:28,259
Who is that?

661
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:30,970
<i>That is Sirius Black, that is.</i>

662
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,433
<i>Sirius Black is an essential
character for Harry.</i>

663
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:36,934
It's part of Jo's themes of

664
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:38,769
"Don't judge a book
by its cover," you know?

665
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,605
The image of Sirius Black
as a criminal

666
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:42,815
is one that's presented
to Harry.

667
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,942
We have a killer
on the loose.

668
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:46,944
Sirius Black, you mean?

669
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,738
But what's he got
to do with me?

670
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:51,032
<i>And yet,
when Harry meets him</i>

671
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,159
<i>and through the course
of the third film,</i>

672
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:56,954
he comes to learn that he's not
who he has been told he was.

673
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:58,789
He's somebody very different.

674
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:01,751
<i>And Gary is such
a remarkable actor.</i>

675
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:03,794
One of the reasons we
chose him is he obviously

676
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:06,297
has the potential for darkness,

677
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,969
but he has such soul
and has such a warmth within.

678
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,804
Can I ask you, when were...

679
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:15,848
were you first
approached to be Sirius?

680
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:17,475
I was aware of Harry Potter,

681
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:20,978
but it... it was very much
a sort of kids' thing.

682
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:24,482
People were telling me to read
the books and I had kids,

683
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:27,485
so it was gonna be
in my universe somewhere.

684
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:31,364
And then they were taking
a slightly darker approach.

685
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:33,032
- Yeah.
- The book was interesting.

686
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:35,618
I met Alfonso,
and I think at the time,

687
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:36,994
he was the main attraction.

688
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,704
Now, remember, guys,
that you have to

689
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:40,957
- take care of your frogs.
- Yeah. Don't worry.

690
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,585
For "Azkaban,"
it's a coming of age.

691
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,922
<i>They're passing the threshold
between childhood</i>

692
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:50,758
<i>and their teenage years.</i>

693
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:54,178
In the first two,
Harry is still a child.

694
00:31:54,261 --> 00:32:00,518
<i>There is a greater optimism
around the tone itself.</i>

695
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:03,270
<i>Nevertheless,
when he turns 13,</i>

696
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,605
<i>there's a big cloud</i>

697
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,525
that overshadows
everything around Harry,

698
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:11,195
and we needed to convey that
also stylistically.

699
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:22,039
What's going on?

700
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:25,459
Don't know,
maybe we've broken down.

701
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:38,305
<i>"Prisoner of Azkaban" felt
like a whole new era, really.</i>

702
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,058
It was a much darker
kind of story.

703
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,894
There was a lot of kind of
quite adult themes in it.

704
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:46,397
<i>The descriptions
that JK Rowling</i>

705
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,233
has of the dementors
are very scary,

706
00:32:49,316 --> 00:32:53,279
<i>and I really wanted to convey
the sense that the dementors,</i>

707
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:57,742
what they do is they suck
all the joy away,

708
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:02,163
<i>that they were sucking
an essence of Harry.</i>

709
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:05,249
<i>But I think that the most
important piece</i>

710
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:08,502
<i>to achieve that
was Dan's performance.</i>

711
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:13,090
When was "Azkaban"...
how old were you?

712
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,425
14.

713
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,718
- Really?
- Yeah.

714
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,303
- When we first met?
- Yeah.

715
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:20,765
I think I had a natural
sort of paternal thing.

716
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:28,981
Are you going to kill me,
Harry?

717
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:30,900
The first person I remember
being, like,

718
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,818
in order of when they came in
was Gary.

719
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,403
I remember that. I remember...

720
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:36,947
I remember you
giving me the Gary chat.

721
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,617
Yeah, you were like, "Listen,
Emma, you need to be cool,

722
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,161
"because Gary Oldman...
it's a really big deal,

723
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:44,747
and you need to be cool,"
and I was like, "Okay."

724
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,499
And which was... which
was really a projection

725
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:48,250
of my own fears
'cause I was like,

726
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:51,253
"Dan, you need to be cool.
This guy's a big deal."

727
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:54,965
<i>Dan was first a bit daunted.</i>

728
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:58,469
And Gary was amazingly generous
as a person,

729
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:01,347
but also as an actor,
and immediately embrace him

730
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,475
<i>and include him
in... in the acting process.</i>

731
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,770
It was really sweet
to... to see the two of them.

732
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:12,316
And it was almost as if it was
mirroring that relationship

733
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,361
<i>because, in many ways,
Harry has made a totem</i>

734
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,321
<i>out of Sirius Black.</i>

735
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:20,616
That totem
that is kind of unapproachable

736
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,660
and in many ways scary.

737
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:24,954
<i>And then that was not unlike
in the film</i>

738
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:27,581
<i>that when they discover
who they truly are,</i>

739
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,167
<i>is when suddenly
there's an amazing bond.</i>

740
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:32,419
You saw them between takes

741
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,256
sitting with each other,
talking and laughing.

742
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,175
<i>And you could see in the way
that Dan looked at Gary</i>

743
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:42,012
<i>the adulation and the respect
that he had for him.</i>

744
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:43,681
All the stuff in
the Shrieking Shack at the end,

745
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:45,349
I feel like me and Rupert
and Emma were just, like,

746
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:46,559
watching tennis in that scene
just being like,

747
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,102
"This is acting, guys.

748
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,187
This is what we all need
to be working towards."

749
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:52,356
<i>There was Tim Spall,</i>

750
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,316
- <i>the one and only Alan Rickman.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

751
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,362
David Thewlis, you,
Emma, Rupert.

752
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:00,197
It's really nice of you
to include me, Emma, and Rupert

753
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:01,323
in that group.

754
00:35:01,407 --> 00:35:02,783
<i>To watch you guys act but also</i>

755
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,493
<i>just watching
you guys as people</i>

756
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:06,704
and just watching these,
like, incredible actors

757
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,372
who were just like,
"Oh, yeah, no.

758
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:10,291
"You're just people
and you'd have fun in between

759
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,126
<i>and the whole process
doesn't have to be painful."</i>

760
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,086
<i>It can be intense
and you showed me the wonders</i>

761
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,547
<i>of that sometimes as well
and that was really important.</i>

762
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,215
- Let's kill him!
- Wait.

763
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:23,512
I did my waiting!
12 years of it!

764
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:25,306
In Azkaban!

765
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,765
I have never done a scene

766
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:29,185
with such an amazing cast
in my life.

767
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:30,853
<i>It's a very long scene.</i>

768
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:32,813
<i>It's a scene in which
there are a lot of twists</i>

769
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,357
<i>inside the scene,
and it was so much fun.</i>

770
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:39,028
It's an intense scene in which
a lot of things are at stake.

771
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:41,572
No! I trusted you!

772
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:45,159
<i>And you can see...
Rupert and Emma and Dan...</i>

773
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:48,245
<i>that they are completely
committed to this scene.</i>

774
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:51,749
I love it. I-I have such
a great memory of it.

775
00:35:51,832 --> 00:35:54,376
I told Dumbledore
you were helping an old friend

776
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,921
into the castle,
and now here's the proof.

777
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:58,964
Brilliant, Snape.
Once again,

778
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:00,966
you've put your keen and
penetrating mind to the task,

779
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,260
and as usual,
come to the wrong conclusion.

780
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:05,971
<i>I always loved
the character of Sirius.</i>

781
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:07,765
I love the relationship
Harry and Sirius have.

782
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:11,727
He's like this cool uncle,
but also older brother figure.

783
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,438
<i>He's painted
as this villainous guy</i>

784
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:17,024
<i>and then has the switch
where you go,</i>

785
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:20,110
<i>"Oh, he was set up
and he's a good guy."</i>

786
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:21,612
<i>And he's so kind
and so warm...</i>

787
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:22,947
- And he's warm and kind...
- And cool.

788
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,823
- And he's kinda cool.
- Yeah.

789
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:27,826
I wish I'd had
the whole picture.

790
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,828
You know, we only
ever found out book...

791
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:31,247
Yeah, book by book.

792
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,748
- I don't know whether you...
- I did not.

793
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:34,208
Because you were
Harry Potter, you had a...

794
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,542
Just Rickman.
Rickman did. That was it.

795
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,253
- Rickman?
- He had the inside line.

796
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:38,545
He worked that well.

797
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,339
He very, very early
said to Jo,

798
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:42,883
he was like, "I think I need
to know what happens."

799
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,301
I need to know.

800
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:48,889
Give me a reason. I beg you.

801
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,599
<i>Rickman would have an in,
wouldn't he?</i>

802
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:51,934
He did, yeah.

803
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:53,477
And he never told Chris,
never told anyone.

804
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,937
He would... Chris would
literally say to him,

805
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,230
"Why are you doing that
like that?"

806
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:57,773
He'd say,
"I'll tell you later."

807
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,030
Yeah, "You'll find out
on a need-to-know basis."

808
00:37:05,114 --> 00:37:06,532
Wait a decade.

809
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:10,411
Dan was not a child actor.
Was another fellow actor.

810
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,663
Alfonso was like,
"Now you're teenagers,

811
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:14,164
and I'm gonna treat you
like a teenager."

812
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:15,708
And he was the first one
who, like,

813
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:18,168
- assigned us homework.
- Yeah.

814
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:19,545
Loosen up, loosen up.

815
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,463
<i>He wanted to get to know us,</i>

816
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:24,508
so he set us this exercise
where he asked us

817
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,385
to write an essay in character.

818
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:31,348
<i>He was like,
"You know these characters</i>

819
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,684
<i>"at this point better
than I'm ever gonna be able</i>

820
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,645
<i>to understand who they are,
so you tell me."</i>

821
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:38,272
<i>And after about, sort of,</i>

822
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,232
<i>a half a side of A4,
I was like,</i>

823
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:42,318
"I feel like I've pretty much
covered everything.

824
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:45,612
<i>"Like, Jo has written
a good 500 pages about this,</i>

825
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,198
"but I feel like this one
pretty much sums it up.

826
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:50,534
Great, okay. Yeah, cool.
Proud of that. Bring that in."

827
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:54,705
Of course, Emma writes,
like, 12 pages,

828
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:56,165
like, beautifully written.

829
00:37:56,248 --> 00:38:00,336
Rupert didn't deliver
anything.

830
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:01,879
I didn't do it.

831
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:03,714
And I said, "Rupert,
where's your assignment?"

832
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:09,261
He says, "Well, uh, I thought
that Ron wouldn't do it..."

833
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:12,139
"So I didn't do it."

834
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:14,391
I mean, luckily,
Alfonso kind of saw

835
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,268
that it was very in character
for... for...

836
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:17,686
for me not to have done it.

837
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,231
Rupert is Ron.

838
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:24,026
<i>It's just Ron 100%.</i>

839
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:28,572
Emma is just such
an effortless actor.

840
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:30,449
<i>She prepares a lot.</i>

841
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,910
When you're doing the scenes,
it's as if everything

842
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:34,578
is just flowing out of her.

843
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,706
<i>The truth of the matter
is that they are great actors.</i>

844
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,835
<i>Sirius Black
finds a redemption</i>

845
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:46,340
<i>by having Harry understanding
who he truly is.</i>

846
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,342
<i>It's a moment of...
of great liberation,</i>

847
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:50,094
<i>of great freedom,</i>

848
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:54,181
and all of this is conveyed
symbolically in the two of them

849
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:57,893
flying in the night
under the silver moon.

850
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,608
<i>It was like a family,
wasn't it?</i>

851
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:05,818
Yeah.

852
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:08,195
More than any
other experience.

853
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:09,947
You never have that
in the movies

854
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,782
because you work
with a bunch of people

855
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:13,367
and you get friendly with them

856
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,078
and then most of them
you would never see again.

857
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:19,373
But with "Potter," you would
come... you would come back

858
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:24,002
and that's what made it,
amongst many things,

859
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:26,171
- what made it very special.
- Yeah.

860
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,507
It just feels like,
you know, being in these,

861
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,968
you get to be a part
of film history.

862
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,645
Hogwarts has been chosen

863
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:45,149
to host
the Triwizard Tournament.

864
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:49,278
"The Goblet of Fire"

865
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:52,322
during all of
the Triwizard Tournament stuff,

866
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:57,244
<i>it was so lovely to be
surprised and blown away</i>

867
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:03,000
and, like, taken away
by the magic of the scenes

868
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,334
and to be surprised.

869
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:05,669
<i>Like, I remember seeing
the Beauxbatons</i>

870
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:07,546
<i>come and do their entrance</i>

871
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:09,840
<i>and the Durmstrangs.</i>

872
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:11,675
It was really cool.

873
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,846
<i>With the fourth film,
we wanted a British director.</i>

874
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:17,556
We wanted something
quite theatrical.

875
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,974
Cut, thank you very much.

876
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:23,061
Mike is just this excited,

877
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:26,064
loud, passionate man.

878
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:29,568
<i>He was a perfect director
for that film.</i>

879
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:32,154
It was a really, like,
bombastic,

880
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:36,158
<i>action-packed, wonderful,
eccentric film.</i>

881
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,826
I love Mike. He was great.

882
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,870
<i>I mean, he was almost like
he was from the books.</i>

883
00:40:39,953 --> 00:40:42,706
He was like
a Hogwarts character.

884
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:45,000
The fourth book
is the biggest of them.

885
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,711
It's about 900 pages.
It's a doorstop.

886
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:49,338
It's a house brick.

887
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:50,797
Action!

888
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,801
<i>And I thought,
if it's really gonna nail</i>

889
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,719
the little darlings
to their seats,

890
00:40:55,802 --> 00:41:01,558
then it has to have this great,
big, energetic core to it.

891
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,895
<i>He was just this kind of,
like, firecracker of energy.</i>

892
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,563
<i>He'd get so excited by things.</i>

893
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:08,899
<i>And there was this kind of
really endearing,</i>

894
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:10,734
like, childlike quality
to... to him.

895
00:41:10,817 --> 00:41:13,570
<i>He loved the humor as well
and would always</i>

896
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,489
<i>try and find it
in every scene.</i>

897
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,325
It was probably only
a couple of films in

898
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,410
that I sort of started
to feel nervous.

899
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,246
- And I remember...
- It was Mike's change

900
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:23,580
when... when Columbus left.

901
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:24,998
It was definitely
a bit of a different...

902
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,542
Yeah,
it was a different vibe.

903
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,585
- Mike Newell.
- Mike treated us like adults.

904
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:29,836
- That was it.
- Yeah.

905
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,755
- He did, I suppose.
- Yeah.

906
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,465
We did have fun on set.

907
00:41:36,843 --> 00:41:40,222
<i>The Weasley twins,
whom I-I was very fond of,</i>

908
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:42,808
<i>they had to fight.</i>

909
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,102
We were doing the scene
when Fred and George

910
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,271
are rejected from entering
the Triwizard Tournament.

911
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:50,023
<i>And then we had these wigs
on and beards on.</i>

912
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,859
<i>What looked like old men.</i>

913
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,694
<i>And Mike said, "Okay, so I
think you guys will be really</i>

914
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,028
<i>"annoyed with each other.
I think you should have</i>

915
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,572
<i>a good fight about this."</i>

916
00:41:56,655 --> 00:42:00,617
These two were sort of,
um, pressing about at it.

917
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:02,286
Cut!

918
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,788
<i>And I said, "No, come on boys,
really, it's a fight."</i>

919
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:06,123
<i>Mike just came over.
He said,</i>

920
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:07,291
<i>"No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no."</i>

921
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:08,834
Okay, who wants to fight?

922
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,420
And like an idiot,
I was like, "Oh, yeah, okay."

923
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:14,673
Well, of course,
I was a tubby 60-year-old gent

924
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:16,133
at that stage.

925
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:20,345
Um, and, uh, I-I really
shouldn't have done it.

926
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:23,015
And so he dived on me
and, like,

927
00:42:23,098 --> 00:42:25,517
just went like this,

928
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,061
to which I said, "Okay."
So I did the same to him.

929
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,023
<i>I-I remember gripping him
'round the waist</i>

930
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:33,567
<i>and trying to fling him about
and so forth</i>

931
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,153
and cracked a couple of ribs.

932
00:42:36,236 --> 00:42:39,573
And so was in absolute agony
from... from then on.

933
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:42,075
But of course,
the wonderful thing was

934
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,786
that I had made
a complete twit of myself

935
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,581
and everybody felt
much better for that.

936
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:51,251
You know when you shouldn't
break a director's rib?

937
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:03,847
<i>In "The Goblet of Fire,"</i>

938
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,642
that film is just all
about teenagers,

939
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:08,352
you know, having crushes
for the first time,

940
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:11,146
asking someone to the date,
to the Yule Ball.

941
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:13,565
<i>They just mirrored all those
kind of awkward phases</i>

942
00:43:13,649 --> 00:43:15,025
you go through as a teenager,

943
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:16,693
and they really
felt like that, too,

944
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:19,196
because we were literally
having the same experiences.

945
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:22,074
The amount of, um, like,
prep and coaching

946
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:23,659
Emma and I would give
each other on, like,

947
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:25,535
texting to the opposite sex...
like, if we...

948
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,079
if she was texting a boy
or I was texting a girl,

949
00:43:27,162 --> 00:43:28,914
I'd be like, "She sent me
this many kisses back.

950
00:43:28,997 --> 00:43:30,707
What do I do?
This is a nightmare."

951
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,378
We had that kind of older
brother, younger sister thing.

952
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:36,171
<i>It was a very
interesting film</i>

953
00:43:36,254 --> 00:43:38,340
in terms of a lot of hormones
flying around.

954
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:41,093
<i>There was crushes,</i>

955
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:42,678
<i>and people
went out with each other</i>

956
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:44,554
and broke up and...
just like you do in...

957
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:45,931
like I used to do at school.

958
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:48,141
Um, it was exactly
the same environment,

959
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,811
<i>but it was just in a Defense
Against the Dark Arts class.</i>

960
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:57,484
That film was probably
peak hormone, at least for me.

961
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:02,739
<i>It was exactly
what you'd expect.</i>

962
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,408
And especially, like,
the fourth film was the one

963
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:07,452
with, like, the Beauxbatons
and the Durmstrangs,

964
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:09,830
<i>so, like, you had a bunch of,</i>

965
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,581
<i>like, hormonal teenagers
anyway,</i>

966
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:14,584
and then, like, bring in two
massive groups of new people,

967
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:17,421
all of them are, like,
purposefully hot for the film.

968
00:44:17,504 --> 00:44:20,048
Um, so it's, yeah,
it was that...

969
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:21,758
that film was, yeah,
it was all kicking off.

970
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,469
Why do they have to travel
in packs?

971
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:27,431
<i>He is just, like,
a slightly awkward teenage boy</i>

972
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:29,641
<i>in a very unremarkable way,</i>

973
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:31,101
which I suppose feels
sort of remarkable

974
00:44:31,184 --> 00:44:32,853
for a hero character
in something.

975
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,438
You slay dragons.

976
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:36,106
If you can't get a date,
who can?

977
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:37,733
I think I'd take the dragon
right now.

978
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:41,403
Jo wrote him very endearingly
in those years,

979
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:46,533
and I feel like it did not
take a huge acting stretch

980
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:51,621
for me to tap into my awkward,
nerdy, teenage side.

981
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:54,124
- Cho.
- Yes?

982
00:44:54,207 --> 00:44:57,335
Um, I just wondered if you...
I just wondered

983
00:44:57,419 --> 00:44:59,629
if maybe you wanted
to go to the ball with me?

984
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:02,257
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

985
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,468
It obviously was
a coming-of-age story.

986
00:45:08,597 --> 00:45:10,182
One of the... the big,
big sequences

987
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:12,058
was the Christmas ball.

988
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:18,815
The Yule Ball is,
first and foremost, a dance.

989
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:22,778
<i>The scene when the students
are learning to dance,</i>

990
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:24,154
it was pretty much like
a typical

991
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:25,655
school dance of that age.

992
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:28,116
You've got girls on one side,
boys on the other.

993
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,827
<i>We were in a big room
in Oxford.</i>

994
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:32,788
Maggie's right in the middle,
and she says,

995
00:45:32,871 --> 00:45:34,664
<i>"Right, I'm gonna
teach you to dance."</i>

996
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:38,835
<i>Of course, she picks Rupert,
and she says,</i>

997
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,670
Place your right hand

998
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:42,672
- on my waist.
- What?

999
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:46,259
The kid's 14, and he knows
how to get a laugh.

1000
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,261
It's great.

1001
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,846
<i>And weirdly, I felt quite</i>

1002
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,348
<i>self-conscious of...
I didn't really know...</i>

1003
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:54,518
I'd never danced
with a lady before,

1004
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,269
so it was kind of
a very new thing.

1005
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,022
Never gonna let him
forget this, are you?

1006
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:00,524
Never.

1007
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,818
And yeah, of course,
James, Oliver, the twins,

1008
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:05,487
they were constantly
kind of ribbing me.

1009
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,072
<i>We were winding him...</i>

1010
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:08,323
We were winding him up
anyway.

1011
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:09,366
Before we started filming.

1012
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,034
They kind of convinced me,

1013
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:12,619
before we filmed it,

1014
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:15,372
that there was this whole,
like, dance routine planned.

1015
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:17,541
We were like,
"Do you know your steps?

1016
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:19,626
"You know, right?
No, you know, the routine.

1017
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,253
"Like, we've all been doing
a routine for, like,

1018
00:46:21,336 --> 00:46:22,712
the past six weeks"
or something like that.

1019
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:25,674
Just try
to build the pressure.

1020
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:27,759
And this way.

1021
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:30,262
Now, you will have to lead
eventually.

1022
00:46:30,345 --> 00:46:31,429
Understood?

1023
00:46:31,513 --> 00:46:32,848
Cut!

1024
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,353
<i>One of the most enchanting
days was the Great Ball</i>

1025
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:40,730
because there was
all these incredibly beautiful

1026
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:43,066
young people,
perfectly dressed.

1027
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:46,486
Bloody hell.

1028
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,451
What are those?
What are those?

1029
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:54,786
My dress robes.

1030
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,496
<i>The suits we had on
were, like,</i>

1031
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,081
<i>really... really wide lapels</i>

1032
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:00,625
and long sort of tails
and yeah,

1033
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:03,128
you didn't...
you didn't feel cool

1034
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,297
at... at really
any point in that.

1035
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,507
I look like
my Great Aunt Tessie.

1036
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,262
Smell like
my great Aunt Tessie.

1037
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:15,432
All I can remember is that,
like, really aggressive,

1038
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,976
<i>like, six-layer collar thing
you had on.</i>

1039
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:19,436
<i>Oh, the little frill
thing, yeah.</i>

1040
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:20,979
But actually, I kinda loved it.

1041
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:22,981
It was kind of...
it was very Weasley.

1042
00:47:23,064 --> 00:47:25,275
- Yeah, it was perfect.
- I felt I pulled it off.

1043
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:26,943
Not a lot of people
could pull it off.

1044
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:28,653
Emma obviously
looked beautiful

1045
00:47:28,737 --> 00:47:30,780
and was in an incredible dress.

1046
00:47:30,864 --> 00:47:32,699
And, uh, me and Rupert
looked like,

1047
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,201
I don't know,
Austin Powers' mates

1048
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,412
or something hanging out
at the side.

1049
00:47:37,495 --> 00:47:40,624
She looks beautiful.

1050
00:47:40,707 --> 00:47:44,127
<i>For the first time,
Harry and Ron...</i>

1051
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,504
<i>particularly Ron...</i>

1052
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:51,718
see Hermione as a young woman,

1053
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:56,139
<i>not just this kind of sidekick
that they each have.</i>

1054
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:59,559
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

1055
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,479
No, absolutely not.

1056
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,982
I mean, everyone can kind of
relate to that.

1057
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:07,651
That's what I kind of love
about these stories

1058
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:10,570
<i>is they sit so parallel
to everyone's life,</i>

1059
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:15,033
like the first school dance
and those kind of emotions,

1060
00:48:15,116 --> 00:48:18,328
<i>those anxieties, insecurities.</i>

1061
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:21,665
I knew it was a big deal,
and I was miserable.

1062
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:23,291
I li... I...

1063
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,877
<i>I just knew it was the, like,</i>

1064
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:27,963
<i>duckling becomes a swan
moment.</i>

1065
00:48:28,046 --> 00:48:30,840
<i>I knew there was just, like,
all of this pressure suddenly.</i>

1066
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:33,677
Now, don't swing your arms,
okay?

1067
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,011
Mike Newell coached me

1068
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:37,472
to walk down the stairs
in the dress.

1069
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:39,099
"Your arms are swinging
too much.

1070
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,518
You're walking too quickly.
You need to walk slower."

1071
00:48:41,601 --> 00:48:43,645
<i>Like, he's giving me
a million different directions</i>

1072
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:45,105
<i>about how to walk
down the stairs.</i>

1073
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,399
And of course,
I fell down the stairs.

1074
00:48:47,482 --> 00:48:50,652
<i>We were a bunch of very
self-conscious teenagers.</i>

1075
00:48:50,735 --> 00:48:52,404
<i>They were, like, uh,</i>

1076
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:54,364
"You're gonna learn
some dance steps for this."

1077
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:56,074
You trust me, don't you?

1078
00:48:56,157 --> 00:48:58,493
<i>I'm not a dancer, and I
will never be able to dance.</i>

1079
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:01,079
Yeah, I feel like
I'm pretty rigid

1080
00:49:01,162 --> 00:49:02,539
in... in that dance scene.

1081
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,545
Oh, look at that.
Look at that. Stunned.

1082
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:10,547
Lucky man. Lucky man.

1083
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,842
Emma and I have always
loved each other, really.

1084
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:16,720
I walked into the room
where we were having tutoring.

1085
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:18,346
<i>The assignment
that had been given</i>

1086
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,766
<i>was to draw what you
thought God looked like.</i>

1087
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,813
And Tom had drawn a girl with
a backward cap on a skateboard.

1088
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,357
<i>And I just don't know
how to say it...</i>

1089
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:31,276
<i>I just fell in love with him.</i>

1090
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,070
I think I was in the hair
and makeup chair.

1091
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:36,406
And someone said something
along the lines of,

1092
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:37,615
"Yeah, she had a crush on you."

1093
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:39,159
I used to come in every day

1094
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,910
and look for his number
on the call sheet.

1095
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:42,454
It was number seven.

1096
00:49:42,537 --> 00:49:44,622
And if it... if... if his number
was on the call sheet,

1097
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:47,250
it was an extra exciting day.

1098
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:49,419
He was three years above me.

1099
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:53,339
And so for him, he was like,
"You're like my little sister."

1100
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,508
<i>I was... became very
protective over her.</i>

1101
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,178
Yeah, I've always had
a soft spot for... for her,

1102
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:01,222
um, and that continues
to the day.

1103
00:50:01,306 --> 00:50:04,100
I think really the truth
of it was Tom

1104
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:09,189
was the one that I could often
be more vulnerable with.

1105
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,857
There's always been something
that's like,

1106
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,358
I don't know, a kinship.

1107
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,778
Nothing has ever, ever, ever,
ever happened

1108
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:16,321
<i>romantically with us.</i>

1109
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:18,782
We just love each other.

1110
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,617
That's all I can say
about that.

1111
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:27,957
Together! One...

1112
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,542
Two, three.

1113
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:40,303
In "The Goblet of Fire,"
the universe shifts,

1114
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:43,973
and suddenly,
there is Voldemort.

1115
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:53,233
<i>I cast Ralph Fiennes because</i>

1116
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:56,778
<i>he's one of the most potent
actors of his generation.</i>

1117
00:50:56,861 --> 00:50:59,739
And I knew
that he had a great force,

1118
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:04,494
<i>just kind of delicate,
subtle force of personality.</i>

1119
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:07,789
<i>My sister has children
who were then</i>

1120
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,666
<i>around 10, 11, 12.</i>

1121
00:51:09,749 --> 00:51:12,252
I said, "Martha, I don't know
about this Harry Potter thing.

1122
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,295
Voldemort. What's that?"

1123
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:15,588
"What?

1124
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,799
"You're being asked
to play Voldemort?

1125
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:19,843
You've got to do it!"

1126
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,600
<i>And then I was shown
some drawings...</i>

1127
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,060
design ideas for the look.

1128
00:51:29,144 --> 00:51:31,187
<i>I wasn't expecting that.</i>

1129
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:34,315
<i>And I thought,
"Wow, that's a strong look."</i>

1130
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:36,693
I didn't feel Voldemort
was that human.

1131
00:51:36,776 --> 00:51:38,945
I felt he was
the essence of evil.

1132
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:40,363
<i>I know he's been human,</i>

1133
00:51:40,446 --> 00:51:43,074
<i>but he's become
a snakelike thing.</i>

1134
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:44,409
So there was the voice.

1135
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:47,078
The sort of snakelike
whispered, husky,

1136
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:51,499
something that I suppose I've...
sort of whispering voice.

1137
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:54,460
Breath on the breath.

1138
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:57,297
"Ah, Harry Potter..."

1139
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,507
Come to die.

1140
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:02,802
Ralph wanted to be
ultimately evil

1141
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:03,970
and otherworldly.

1142
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:06,306
<i>And the best way to do that</i>

1143
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,725
<i>was to take his nose off.</i>

1144
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:11,060
He does have a nose...
spoiler alert...

1145
00:52:11,144 --> 00:52:12,937
<i>and he was covered
in stickers.</i>

1146
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:17,025
So he was slightly less
intimidating than on-screen,

1147
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:18,818
except when they called action.

1148
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,904
And for some reason,
I was terrified of him.

1149
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:24,657
I can touch you.

1150
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,576
<i>It took about three hours
in makeup,</i>

1151
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:28,786
<i>the painting of the hands,
the nails, the teeth,</i>

1152
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,414
and even with my nose,

1153
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:36,044
um, I... I felt...

1154
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,424
<i>Strong. It felt powerful.
It felt evil.</i>

1155
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:47,013
What was big was that one
of the people that you assume

1156
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:51,559
is gonna be very important
to the story is Cedric Diggory.

1157
00:52:51,643 --> 00:52:56,397
<i>In that confrontation,
Cedric is killed.</i>

1158
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:58,441
Kill the spare.

1159
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:00,985
- <i>Avada Kedavra!</i>
- Cedric!

1160
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:07,909
<i>And Harry,
he manages to take the body</i>

1161
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:12,330
and crash land back at the end
of the competition,

1162
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:16,542
<i>and Cedric Diggory's father
believes that his son has won</i>

1163
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,504
and then he realizes
that the kid is dead,

1164
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:21,839
and he howls like a dog.

1165
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:23,299
That's my boy!

1166
00:53:26,052 --> 00:53:28,972
That's my boy!

1167
00:53:29,055 --> 00:53:32,016
<i>Suddenly, something
completely unexpected</i>

1168
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,602
<i>and serious happens,</i>

1169
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:38,314
and suddenly you realize that
this movie is not about life.

1170
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:39,524
It's about death.

1171
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:40,984
<i>It's such a massive scene</i>

1172
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,568
<i>'cause it is also
the first time</i>

1173
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,571
<i>Harry sort of feels
that kind of death</i>

1174
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,699
of... of somebody young,
close to him.

1175
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:50,994
<i>That's a scene I remember
really distinctly going,</i>

1176
00:53:51,077 --> 00:53:52,829
<i>"Oh, this is...
yes, these are kids' films,</i>

1177
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:54,664
<i>but my God, there's some
challenging stuff in there."</i>

1178
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:59,168
He's back, he's back.
Voldemort's back.

1179
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:01,421
<i>The moment of
Cedric Diggory's death</i>

1180
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,967
<i>is the moment
when the series comes of age,</i>

1181
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:10,221
and now the children
have left childhood

1182
00:54:10,305 --> 00:54:12,432
<i>and are going to have
to confront</i>

1183
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,767
<i>the perils of adulthood.</i>

1184
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,021
<i>And it all comes
from that moment of death.</i>

1185
00:54:18,104 --> 00:54:20,857
Cedric Diggory was murdered

1186
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,692
by Lord Voldemort.

1187
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:27,155
<i>The three of them,
they're in adversity,</i>

1188
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:30,700
and that forges friendships,
as we know.

1189
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,835
<i>"You are protected,
in short,</i>

1190
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:43,338
<i>by your ability to love,"</i>

1191
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:45,840
<i>said Dumbledore loudly.</i>

1192
00:54:45,923 --> 00:54:48,676
<i>"The only protection
that can possibly work</i>

1193
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,388
<i>"against the lure of power
like Voldemort's.</i>

1194
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:54,682
<i>"In spite
of all the temptation</i>

1195
00:54:54,766 --> 00:54:58,186
<i>"you have endured,
all the suffering,</i>

1196
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:01,522
<i>you remain pure of heart."</i>

1197
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:17,914
How nice of you to let us
do this in your house.

1198
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:20,041
I know, so nice.

1199
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:21,542
You know what
I've always wanted to do?

1200
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:24,670
Let me see if we can...
is get up here.

1201
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,508
Oh, now, look, they really
don't look very well.

1202
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:32,428
- They're all still here.
- They're really still here.

1203
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:35,932
I mean, has anyone fed them?
This is so sad.

1204
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:37,683
Okay, now you can be
Harry Potter.

1205
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:38,976
Okay, actually.

1206
00:55:40,895 --> 00:55:42,772
I'll go down the right,
you go down the left.

1207
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:45,525
Yeah, and let's race, okay?
On your mark, set, go.

1208
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,901
Oh, God.

1209
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:49,570
We're snogging down here.

1210
00:55:50,863 --> 00:55:52,532
- Get over it.
- You know what?

1211
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,784
I-I took a photograph
of something.

1212
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:58,121
Last night, I thought, I'm just
gonna dig up these things,

1213
00:55:58,204 --> 00:56:00,206
and I asked for your autograph.

1214
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:01,457
God. Is that right?

1215
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,708
No. Read it out.

1216
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:06,254
It's so nice to see you.
What does it say?

1217
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:07,839
- "Dear HBC..."
- Yeah.

1218
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:11,884
"It was a pleasure being
your costar and coaster."

1219
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:12,969
Wow.

1220
00:56:13,052 --> 00:56:14,095
What a... what a clever pun.

1221
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:15,596
That was clever.

1222
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,973
I mean, I'm honestly still
kinda pleased with that.

1223
00:56:17,056 --> 00:56:18,474
You were poetic.
Yeah, yeah.

1224
00:56:18,558 --> 00:56:19,934
"In the sense
that I always ended up

1225
00:56:20,017 --> 00:56:22,019
holding your coffee.
I do love you."

1226
00:56:22,103 --> 00:56:23,729
And what does it say?

1227
00:56:27,066 --> 00:56:28,609
- You can share.
- I can.

1228
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:30,403
We can share this now.
I said, "I do love you.

1229
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:32,155
"And I just wish I'd been born
10 years earlier.

1230
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:33,656
I might've been in
with a chance."

1231
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:35,116
It's all right now.

1232
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,492
"Lots of love
and thanks for being cool."

1233
00:56:36,576 --> 00:56:37,702
Isn't it nice?

1234
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,162
Now, I shall always
treasure that.

1235
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:41,873
- Thank you.
- That is in my toilet, Dan.

1236
00:56:48,629 --> 00:56:50,006
<i>There's a storm coming,
Harry.</i>

1237
00:56:50,089 --> 00:56:52,175
We'd all best be ready
when she does.

1238
00:56:53,885 --> 00:56:57,930
Yes!

1239
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,558
<i>I was in film number five,
"Order of the Phoenix."</i>

1240
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:02,059
- Yeah.
- Look, I got my teeth.

1241
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:03,478
- Helena's brought her teeth.
- My teeth.

1242
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:05,104
She's assured me
that she's done

1243
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,064
literally nothing to these
in terms of cleaning.

1244
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:10,902
No, these are actual relic.
There's 11 years in there.

1245
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:13,488
Yeah, it smells a bit whiffy,
but...

1246
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:14,906
You just gonna put them
right in your mouth, yeah?

1247
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:16,157
No, but the teeth
were helpful.

1248
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,658
- Yeah.
- Okay, in they go.

1249
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:19,702
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I'd forgotten.

1250
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:20,870
Do... do you remember me?

1251
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:22,455
I remember... this is... yeah.

1252
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,002
- The teeth helped.
- With the character?

1253
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:29,754
I think I wanted
to be in camouflage.

1254
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,923
When I was first offered it,
Jo sent me

1255
00:57:32,006 --> 00:57:33,299
a secret message saying, like,

1256
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:34,842
"There might not be much
on the page,

1257
00:57:34,926 --> 00:57:37,011
"but she's gonna
do something significant."

1258
00:57:37,094 --> 00:57:38,429
With Bellatrix, it was fun,

1259
00:57:38,513 --> 00:57:40,181
because it was fostering
the... the childish

1260
00:57:40,264 --> 00:57:42,725
and the naughty.
I was just like...

1261
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,227
- And totally anarchist.
- And the psychopath, yeah.

1262
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,436
There was like
a playfulness to her...

1263
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,812
There was the playfulness.

1264
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,356
Which is, like,
even more disturbing.

1265
00:57:48,439 --> 00:57:49,899
Of course, Bellatrix
doesn't think she's evil.

1266
00:57:49,982 --> 00:57:51,317
- She thinks she's the opposite.
- No. Right.

1267
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,735
So I had to sort of construct

1268
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:54,820
a reason for why
she should hurt people

1269
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:59,075
and why, for her,
she is desensitized.

1270
00:57:59,158 --> 00:58:01,536
It makes her feel powerful.

1271
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:03,204
Ha!

1272
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:06,040
Itty, bitty, Potter.

1273
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:08,668
Yeah!

1274
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:13,172
Bellatrix was just
this wild thing

1275
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:14,590
that was uncontrollable.

1276
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:15,967
You can never really know

1277
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,802
what's gonna
come out of her mouth next.

1278
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:21,347
<i>Very exciting for an actor,
'cause it was like,</i>

1279
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,933
whatever she did on that take
does not mean she's gonna do

1280
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:25,393
the same one the next.

1281
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:27,520
I remember trying to be
in charge of the scene

1282
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,105
and her just having
the best time.

1283
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,275
<i>She's just allowed to do
anything she wanted.</i>

1284
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:34,110
She could cackle,
she would jump up and down.

1285
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:35,611
Calm down.

1286
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:37,280
<i>And say whatever she wanted.</i>

1287
00:58:37,363 --> 00:58:40,783
And just not knowing... not...
trying to keep her in tow.

1288
00:58:40,866 --> 00:58:42,410
You filthy half-blood!

1289
00:58:42,493 --> 00:58:44,787
It's all right, he's just
a curious lad, aren't you?

1290
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,455
I kept on wanting to go,
"Shut up."

1291
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:48,499
Draco.

1292
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,759
- I killed you, didn't I?
- You killed me, but...

1293
00:58:58,843 --> 00:59:00,303
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1294
00:59:00,386 --> 00:59:02,013
- Um...
- Had to be done.

1295
00:59:02,096 --> 00:59:03,973
I remember we worked
on lots of spells and things,

1296
00:59:04,056 --> 00:59:05,516
<i>'cause you were
a really good wizard.</i>

1297
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,268
<i>I was really good witch.</i>

1298
00:59:07,351 --> 00:59:09,770
<i>And we had a real duel,
and they cut the whole lot.</i>

1299
00:59:10,896 --> 00:59:11,814
And that's really messed up,

1300
00:59:11,897 --> 00:59:13,149
because I just thought,

1301
00:59:13,232 --> 00:59:14,984
"I've been to wand school
for weeks."

1302
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:17,069
And we were
on that set for days.

1303
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,529
Days, it was in the run.

1304
00:59:18,613 --> 00:59:20,781
I think it was really
one of my first things

1305
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:22,575
and you fell into the veil.
What was it? The veil?

1306
00:59:22,658 --> 00:59:23,701
- Yeah, yeah.
- Was it?

1307
00:59:23,784 --> 00:59:25,244
I go through the veil.

1308
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,831
Then there was speculation
of, does he come back?

1309
00:59:28,914 --> 00:59:31,125
Can you come back
from the veil?

1310
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,835
- No, you can't.
- No, you can't.

1311
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:35,171
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

1312
00:59:52,104 --> 00:59:53,314
I will say that that was

1313
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:54,523
an interesting point
for all of us

1314
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:55,983
as, like, younger actors.

1315
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:58,402
'Cause there was
a certain group, like Maggie...

1316
00:59:58,486 --> 01:00:00,571
- Yeah
- David Bradley, and Alan.

1317
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:02,865
They had known us
when we were 10 or 11.

1318
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:05,326
And when you came in, by that
point, I was like 15, 16.

1319
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:07,662
So, like, you
and Gary and David, like,

1320
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:10,039
would treat us more
like adults; I loved it.

1321
01:00:10,122 --> 01:00:12,083
You saw in us, that, like,
a few of us were, like,

1322
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,876
kind of ready to be like,
"Could you push me?

1323
01:00:13,959 --> 01:00:16,045
Like, we... we wanna try
and be actors too."

1324
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,555
<i>By the time we get
to "Order of the Phoenix,"</i>

1325
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:29,225
<i>the world is becoming
more political.</i>

1326
01:00:29,308 --> 01:00:31,686
<i>And I felt
we needed a director</i>

1327
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:34,397
<i>who could handle that
in an entertaining way.</i>

1328
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,941
David Yates works
so well with actors,

1329
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:39,985
really pushes them
in all the right way.

1330
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:43,406
Progress for the sake
of progress

1331
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,033
must be discouraged.

1332
01:00:46,117 --> 01:00:49,453
David was just such
a sweet, kind of gentle guy

1333
01:00:49,537 --> 01:00:52,832
<i>that really cared so much
about all of these characters.</i>

1334
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,583
<i>And also, I'd get
a lot of kinda one-on-one</i>

1335
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:56,043
<i>with David Yates.</i>

1336
01:00:56,127 --> 01:00:58,087
<i>I went into
"Order of the Phoenix"</i>

1337
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,089
<i>with the young actors in mind
and sort of thinking about</i>

1338
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:02,425
<i>how we sort of grow
the whole thing up</i>

1339
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:04,760
<i>and make it
a little bit more adult</i>

1340
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:08,222
and sort of thematic
and a little darker.

1341
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:15,104
<i>It needed to expand
and get bigger</i>

1342
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:17,481
<i>and more and more frightening.</i>

1343
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,318
Ah!

1344
01:01:21,402 --> 01:01:25,114
<i>There was a big increase
in scale and complexity,</i>

1345
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:28,743
from being childish
to influencing events

1346
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:31,746
and being part
of the big world.

1347
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:34,123
He's just a boy.

1348
01:01:34,206 --> 01:01:35,541
You say much more,
and you might as well

1349
01:01:35,624 --> 01:01:37,042
induct him into the Order
straight away.

1350
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,669
Good. I want to join.

1351
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:40,755
If Voldemort's raising an army,
then I want to fight.

1352
01:01:44,884 --> 01:01:48,179
<i>When I started, one thing
that David and the studio</i>

1353
01:01:48,262 --> 01:01:49,972
spoke to me about was,

1354
01:01:50,055 --> 01:01:54,894
Emma is not sure she wants to
come back to do another Potter.

1355
01:01:55,728 --> 01:01:57,104
Oh, Harry.

1356
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:02,818
People definitely forget
what she took on

1357
01:02:02,902 --> 01:02:04,987
and how gracefully she did it.

1358
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:08,908
<i>Dan and Rupert,
they had each other.</i>

1359
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,993
<i>I had my cronies,</i>

1360
01:02:11,076 --> 01:02:12,828
whereas Emma
was not only younger,

1361
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:16,624
she was... she was by herself.

1362
01:02:16,707 --> 01:02:20,753
I did find a diary entry
that was kind of like, hmm.

1363
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:25,549
<i>I could see that,
at times, I was lonely.</i>

1364
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:27,343
We never talked
about it on the film

1365
01:02:27,426 --> 01:02:29,053
because we were all just kids.

1366
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:31,680
<i>As a 14-year-old boy,</i>

1367
01:02:31,764 --> 01:02:33,349
I was never gonna turn around
to another 14-year-old

1368
01:02:33,432 --> 01:02:34,683
and be like,
"Hey, how you doing?

1369
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,560
Like, is everything okay?"

1370
01:02:36,644 --> 01:02:38,187
<i>So "Order of the Phoenix."</i>

1371
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,356
Was when things started
getting spicy for all of us.

1372
01:02:40,439 --> 01:02:42,691
Mm, but you were
considering pulling out.

1373
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:44,360
I never really spoke
to you about this.

1374
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:47,029
Yeah. I think, um...

1375
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:48,572
- I think I was scared.
- Yeah.

1376
01:02:48,656 --> 01:02:50,199
I don't know if...
if you ever felt like

1377
01:02:50,282 --> 01:02:51,534
it got to a tipping point
when you were like...

1378
01:02:51,617 --> 01:02:53,202
Oh, absolutely.

1379
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:54,578
This is kinda forever now.

1380
01:02:54,662 --> 01:02:56,580
Yeah.
No, I had moments like that.

1381
01:02:56,664 --> 01:02:57,873
Kind of all the way through.

1382
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:03,254
<i>I would say I had kind of
similar feelings to Emma.</i>

1383
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:06,090
Kind of contemplating
what life would be like

1384
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:08,717
if I called it a day, but...

1385
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:11,011
<i>we never really spoke
about... I guess we were just</i>

1386
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:12,888
<i>kind of going through it
at our own pace.</i>

1387
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:14,682
We were kind of in the moment.

1388
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:18,686
At the time, it just didn't
really occur to us

1389
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:22,439
that we were all kind of having
similar... similar feelings.

1390
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,527
Yeah, um...

1391
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:30,406
the fame thing had
finally hit home in a big way.

1392
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:35,619
No one had to convince me
to see it through.

1393
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,415
<i>The fans genuinely
wanted us to succeed,</i>

1394
01:03:39,498 --> 01:03:42,918
and we all genuinely
had each other's backs.

1395
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:44,211
How great is that?

1396
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:55,431
<i>It's always amazing
that these films</i>

1397
01:03:55,514 --> 01:03:57,433
<i>mean so much to them,
they...'cause we...</i>

1398
01:03:57,516 --> 01:04:00,394
<i>they kind of grew up
alongside us and helped them</i>

1399
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:02,813
<i>with some really difficult
things in their lives.</i>

1400
01:04:02,897 --> 01:04:06,191
And I'm just very proud
to be a part of something

1401
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:10,070
that means so much to so many.

1402
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,328
I've been thinking about

1403
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:19,622
something Dumbledore
said to me.

1404
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:20,956
What's that?

1405
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,877
That even though we've got
a fight ahead of us,

1406
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,421
we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1407
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:29,465
Yeah?

1408
01:04:31,592 --> 01:04:33,802
Something worth fighting for.

1409
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:39,975
My son, Billy, we used
to watch them every night.

1410
01:04:40,059 --> 01:04:41,936
You know, if he got
the Sunday night blues,

1411
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:44,313
he was watching a Potter movie.

1412
01:04:44,396 --> 01:04:45,814
That was his safe place.

1413
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:47,524
I'm really looking forward
to watching the films

1414
01:04:47,608 --> 01:04:49,485
with my hypothetical children
one day.

1415
01:04:49,568 --> 01:04:52,029
It's massive, the impact.
It is extraordinary.

1416
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:53,322
It is unbelievable.

1417
01:04:57,034 --> 01:05:00,287
I was writing to JK Rowling
since I was about 11 years old

1418
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:01,997
<i>to say thank you to her
to say,</i>

1419
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:04,959
I would find life a bit
hopeless without Harry Potter.

1420
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:07,127
<i>Luckily for me,
she read the letter</i>

1421
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:08,671
<i>and responded to it.</i>

1422
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:12,675
So I'm one of the very lucky
few people who can say

1423
01:05:12,758 --> 01:05:14,551
JK Rowling was my pen friend.

1424
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,224
<i>The first part
of the audition</i>

1425
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:21,892
is this crazy open call.

1426
01:05:21,976 --> 01:05:24,019
Literally, anyone can come.

1427
01:05:25,479 --> 01:05:27,022
That's my ticket.
Off we go.

1428
01:05:27,106 --> 01:05:28,065
Let's go to London.

1429
01:05:28,148 --> 01:05:29,775
We fly, of course.

1430
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:33,278
<i>And there would be thousands
of people lining up.</i>

1431
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,240
<i>I remember Dan very vividly.</i>

1432
01:05:36,323 --> 01:05:37,700
<i>It was on my screen test.</i>

1433
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:39,118
Mistletoe.

1434
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:42,246
I remember him talking to me,

1435
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:43,956
and I kept forgetting
that I have to talk back to him

1436
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,709
because I'm so used
to watching him on a screen.

1437
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:48,293
So I would just
kind of be like...

1438
01:05:49,253 --> 01:05:51,213
I kind of think
that contributed to the whole

1439
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:56,010
Luna Lovegood vibe,
because she is a bit spacy.

1440
01:05:56,093 --> 01:05:57,469
Hello, everyone.

1441
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,472
You look dreadful, Ron.

1442
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:04,351
And then he found
this secret world of odd bots,

1443
01:06:04,435 --> 01:06:07,479
of misfits, of people
who had this strange power

1444
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:10,065
but who still had
enormous humanity

1445
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:11,900
<i>and depth and vulnerability.</i>

1446
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:13,944
<i>The movies kind of
gave people permission</i>

1447
01:06:14,028 --> 01:06:15,612
<i>to accept parts of themselves.</i>

1448
01:06:15,696 --> 01:06:18,741
<i>So it was quite liberating
to see your oddness</i>

1449
01:06:18,824 --> 01:06:21,910
as a superpower
represented on-screen.

1450
01:06:21,994 --> 01:06:23,912
I remember
when I first met you all...

1451
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:27,082
biggest bunch of misfits
that I ever set eyes on,

1452
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,751
and here we all are.

1453
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,294
We're still
a bunch of misfits.

1454
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:33,130
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1455
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,841
I was not good at school.

1456
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:37,634
You'd be better off with
"Goshawk's Guide to Herbology."

1457
01:06:37,718 --> 01:06:39,553
I didn't have
a huge amount of friends.

1458
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:42,514
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

1459
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:45,893
<i>I think it's great
to be a misfit.</i>

1460
01:06:45,976 --> 01:06:48,270
And I think that's possibly
why it's so popular.

1461
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:50,939
Everyone wants to know
that they do belong.

1462
01:06:51,023 --> 01:06:53,484
<i>It's a great relief
of loneliness, I think.</i>

1463
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,027
<i>I was quite a shy kid.</i>

1464
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,404
<i>I could relate
to that kind of feeling</i>

1465
01:06:57,488 --> 01:07:00,949
of not quite knowing
what your place is.

1466
01:07:01,033 --> 01:07:02,951
<i>Working hard is important,</i>

1467
01:07:03,035 --> 01:07:04,620
but there's something
that matters even more.

1468
01:07:04,703 --> 01:07:06,914
- Stupefy!
- Believing in yourself.

1469
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,377
<i>Everyone felt
more like they belonged</i>

1470
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:15,547
by witnessing these characters
that didn't belong.

1471
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,636
<i>Bonnie was,
kind of, when she arrived,</i>

1472
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,014
she was only 9, maybe.

1473
01:07:24,098 --> 01:07:25,599
Mummy, have you seen
my jumper?

1474
01:07:25,682 --> 01:07:27,935
Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

1475
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:29,394
Hello.

1476
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,523
I always found Ginny, Harry,
that relationship,

1477
01:07:32,606 --> 01:07:35,400
how that kind of
slowly developed

1478
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:39,655
and entangling with it
the whole Weasley family

1479
01:07:39,738 --> 01:07:43,033
<i>and Harry essentially
becoming a Weasley, himself.</i>

1480
01:07:44,118 --> 01:07:45,661
It was something I never
really kind of expected,

1481
01:07:45,744 --> 01:07:47,412
especially kind
of reading the books.

1482
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,164
<i>Bonnie was the youngest one.</i>

1483
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:51,750
So it was just a bit like,
"Oh, what? This is weird."

1484
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:54,211
Close your eyes.

1485
01:07:54,294 --> 01:07:56,421
<i>And you know, there is
this kind of pressure.</i>

1486
01:07:56,505 --> 01:08:00,175
You know, this is the loved
sort of hero of the story.

1487
01:08:00,259 --> 01:08:02,344
So everyone on the set
has known you

1488
01:08:02,427 --> 01:08:04,721
for about six or seven years,
and they've watched you grow up

1489
01:08:04,805 --> 01:08:07,266
<i>and they're now gonna
just watch you kiss.</i>

1490
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,559
Cool. Yeah.

1491
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,444
<i>I mean, there's so many
amazing female roles</i>

1492
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,904
that Jo wrote, and I think
that's really important.

1493
01:08:20,988 --> 01:08:26,493
I am so proud of who Bonnie
and Evanna and Katie are

1494
01:08:26,577 --> 01:08:27,995
and who they've become.

1495
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:31,206
They've all become
these incredible activists.

1496
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:34,877
Every single one of those girls
was like a lovely,

1497
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,045
great human being.

1498
01:08:42,134 --> 01:08:44,052
I tell you,
I've... I've missed your company.

1499
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:45,888
- Did you? Aw, thank you.
- That's for sure.

1500
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:47,556
Did you get anything?
'Cause I stole quite a lot.

1501
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:48,932
- Did you really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:08:49,016 --> 01:08:50,601
I didn't.
I should have known that.

1503
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:52,227
- I should have told you.
- I'm quite reassured by that.

1504
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:55,397
'cause I was definitely
trying to steal my wand.

1505
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,857
And I worry that if I had,

1506
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,358
I probably would have
lost it by now somewhere.

1507
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:00,319
You know they don't work,
Tom.

1508
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,695
Well, I've been assured

1509
01:09:01,778 --> 01:09:04,698
that in time,
with enough practice...

1510
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:06,658
- Practice it would work.
- Yes.

1511
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,619
But it's quite funny
looking back at it now,

1512
01:09:08,702 --> 01:09:10,913
us doing these
incredibly elaborate moves

1513
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:12,498
and nothing happening.

1514
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,791
And nothing... except one time
it did happen with me.

1515
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:17,794
And they said, okay, this time
we are gonna blow up Hogwarts.

1516
01:09:17,878 --> 01:09:19,922
Oh, yeah, you got to do it,
didn't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1517
01:09:20,005 --> 01:09:22,090
And they said,
so we will take your cue.

1518
01:09:22,174 --> 01:09:24,468
When you do your spell,
it will blow up.

1519
01:09:26,386 --> 01:09:30,390
And I was actually
really surprised and scared

1520
01:09:30,474 --> 01:09:32,768
by my own reaction,
'cause I thought, "Wow."

1521
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:38,273
<i>It was this horrible thrill
of power.</i>

1522
01:09:38,357 --> 01:09:39,775
<i>Right.</i>

1523
01:09:39,858 --> 01:09:41,985
And, like, I've had
that amount... just pointing

1524
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:44,112
my wand there
and then it blew up.

1525
01:09:44,196 --> 01:09:45,948
Yeah, it's a lot
more satisfying than,

1526
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:47,824
you know,
making a feather levitate.

1527
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:50,619
Yeah.

1528
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:52,955
<i>So what was Draco doing</i>

1529
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:54,498
<i>with that
weird-looking cabinet,</i>

1530
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:57,125
and who were all those people?
Don't you see?

1531
01:09:57,209 --> 01:09:59,544
It was a ceremony,
an initiation.

1532
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:00,837
Stop it, Harry.

1533
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:02,130
I know where
you're going with this.

1534
01:10:02,214 --> 01:10:04,508
It happened.
He's one of them.

1535
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:05,676
One of what?

1536
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,011
Harry is under the impression

1537
01:10:08,095 --> 01:10:10,389
Draco Malfoy is now
a Death Eater.

1538
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:16,186
<i>The child who hasn't
received affection,</i>

1539
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:19,273
<i>the enabling love
of the parent or the adult</i>

1540
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:22,484
can develop this anger
and hatred at the world

1541
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:24,027
<i>and goes to the dark side.</i>

1542
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:26,238
You dare to talk to me
like that in my own house?

1543
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:27,531
Lucius.

1544
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:29,825
So much of what
Draco's journey is,

1545
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:31,535
is to do with
whether he is or isn't

1546
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:33,036
trying to please his father.

1547
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,997
<i>In the sixth film,
they make him do</i>

1548
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,416
<i>the worst thing ever, or to
attempt the worst thing ever,</i>

1549
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:40,669
<i>of killing Dumbledore, and
obviously we see him crumble.</i>

1550
01:10:40,752 --> 01:10:44,631
Draco, years ago,
I knew a boy

1551
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:47,718
who made all the wrong choices.

1552
01:10:48,969 --> 01:10:51,847
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help.

1553
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,850
Don't you understand?

1554
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:56,601
I have to do this.

1555
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,771
I have to kill you.

1556
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,398
Or he's gonna kill me.

1557
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:02,983
<i>With Tom, what was great
with "Half-Blood Prince"</i>

1558
01:11:03,066 --> 01:11:05,694
was you suddenly
took this bad guy

1559
01:11:05,777 --> 01:11:07,237
<i>who, in the previous films,</i>

1560
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:10,198
<i>had always been
somewhat two dimensional.</i>

1561
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:12,868
And then we were able
to give him the opportunity

1562
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:17,289
to explore a far more complex
and interesting journey.

1563
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:19,458
<i>And I sat down with him
and I said, "Tom, look,</i>

1564
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,127
this is your opportunity
to really shine."

1565
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,380
I remember David Yates saying
if we can get

1566
01:11:25,464 --> 01:11:28,842
just 1% of empathy
or sympathy for him,

1567
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:30,719
<i>then we'll have done our job.</i>

1568
01:11:30,802 --> 01:11:32,179
Do it.

1569
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:34,681
<i>To my mind,
Draco is the hero.</i>

1570
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:36,183
<i>Harry's always gonna
do the right thing.</i>

1571
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:37,684
Harry's always gonna make
the right choice.

1572
01:11:37,768 --> 01:11:39,645
There's never really
any dilemma for him.

1573
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,773
<i>Draco breaks the chains
of this terrible family</i>

1574
01:11:42,856 --> 01:11:45,233
<i>in his responsibility
and what he's expected to do.</i>

1575
01:11:45,317 --> 01:11:49,571
And to watch Tom create
that struggle on-screen

1576
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:51,740
<i>and really manifest
all that nuance,</i>

1577
01:11:51,823 --> 01:11:52,908
all that complication,

1578
01:11:52,991 --> 01:11:54,659
all that great
ethical minefield

1579
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:58,538
that he tiptoes through
was... it was just so impressive.

1580
01:11:58,622 --> 01:11:59,956
No.

1581
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:13,428
Severus.

1582
01:12:22,312 --> 01:12:23,897
Please.

1583
01:12:24,815 --> 01:12:26,650
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

1584
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:38,954
It's obviously amazing
to be back,

1585
01:12:39,037 --> 01:12:41,957
but it's like it's so...

1586
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,960
I guess, like,
shocking that so many people

1587
01:12:45,043 --> 01:12:47,712
that we both thought
would be around for much longer

1588
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,798
than they have been,

1589
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:54,553
like Helen and Alan
and Richard and...

1590
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:57,472
Yeah, they're like fam...
like family,

1591
01:12:57,556 --> 01:12:59,307
you can grieve in the same way.

1592
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,477
- Yeah.
- Just too soon.

1593
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:04,104
Yeah.

1594
01:13:14,114 --> 01:13:17,159
<i>Do not pity the dead, Harry.</i>

1595
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:19,661
<i>Pity the living,</i>

1596
01:13:19,744 --> 01:13:23,915
<i>and above all, all those
who live without love.</i>

1597
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:32,924
It does not do
to dwell on dreams, Harry,

1598
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,260
and forget to live.

1599
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:43,518
Richard Harris was
such a special, warm person.

1600
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:46,646
<i>He was so twinkly.</i>

1601
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:50,317
Well, Richard was classic.

1602
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,028
Probably one of
the funniest men I've ever met.

1603
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:55,030
He was this devilish
11-year-old

1604
01:13:55,113 --> 01:13:58,116
trapped in
a 70-plus-year-old man's body.

1605
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,452
Will you give us
another twirl, ace?

1606
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,747
He just had
that glint in his eye,

1607
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:06,166
which made him the perfect
Dumbledore, by the way.

1608
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:08,293
Hmm, alas.

1609
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,338
Ear wax.

1610
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:16,134
Richard Griffiths was just
delicious as Mr. Dursley.

1611
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,221
There's no such thing
as magic.

1612
01:14:20,263 --> 01:14:23,558
<i>He embraced his wickedness</i>

1613
01:14:23,642 --> 01:14:25,727
with such verve and passion.

1614
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:28,104
<i>His passing was the one
that has affected me most</i>

1615
01:14:28,188 --> 01:14:29,731
<i>because he was generous
with knowledge.</i>

1616
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:31,733
Just, like, wanted to share
everything with you.

1617
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:42,577
I wondered when I'd be
seeing you, Mr. Potter.

1618
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:46,414
I feel really lucky
to have some, you know,

1619
01:14:46,498 --> 01:14:48,083
some little bit of touch

1620
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:50,377
<i>with the amount of just
amazing people that passed.</i>

1621
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,256
You know, I'll be very,
very old one day saying, like,

1622
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:56,925
"I knew that absolute legend."

1623
01:14:57,008 --> 01:14:58,885
I... I know
I ought not be here.

1624
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:03,723
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

1625
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,517
<i>Helen McCrory played
my wife.</i>

1626
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,477
I said, "I think I just met

1627
01:15:07,561 --> 01:15:09,938
the best actress
I've ever seen in my life."

1628
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:12,107
Come.

1629
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,109
I feel lucky to have worked
with her

1630
01:15:14,192 --> 01:15:16,278
and shared just so much,

1631
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,072
<i>frankly, adolescent laughter
with her on the set.</i>

1632
01:15:21,032 --> 01:15:22,742
<i>She had taught me a lot.</i>

1633
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,954
See, I can't even say it.

1634
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,835
She had this ability, yeah,

1635
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:36,673
just to sort of to show
such empathy in her eyes.

1636
01:15:37,382 --> 01:15:39,634
<i>And it was a... it was
a real treat to work with her.</i>

1637
01:15:44,889 --> 01:15:46,308
I can teach you

1638
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:50,687
how to bewitch the mind
and ensnare the senses.

1639
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:53,898
Alan Rickman never talked
to me like I was a child.

1640
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,360
He always took
my thoughts and opinions

1641
01:15:57,444 --> 01:16:02,073
very seriously, which I was
always very touched by.

1642
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,994
Alan was a very dear friend,
and we had that final scene.

1643
01:16:06,077 --> 01:16:07,787
His final scene.

1644
01:16:08,663 --> 01:16:12,167
It answers to you

1645
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,669
and you only.

1646
01:16:15,503 --> 01:16:16,922
Does it?

1647
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,257
<i>I was a little intimidated
by him.</i>

1648
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,594
His precision,
his expert delivery of lines.

1649
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:24,888
<i>And we were sort of went
toe to toe in a funny way,</i>

1650
01:16:24,971 --> 01:16:26,681
<i>you know, Snape and Voldemort.</i>

1651
01:16:26,765 --> 01:16:28,224
<i>Two actors can relish</i>

1652
01:16:28,308 --> 01:16:29,976
<i>metaphorically fencing
with each other.</i>

1653
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,271
Alan was a magician
in that way as an actor.

1654
01:16:38,276 --> 01:16:40,737
<i>The ones that love us
never really leave us.</i>

1655
01:16:42,113 --> 01:16:43,865
And you can always find them.

1656
01:16:46,534 --> 01:16:47,702
In here.

1657
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:25,156
<i>Remember this.</i>

1658
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,326
You're not alone.

1659
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,957
The Elder Wand.

1660
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:39,129
<i>The most powerful wand
ever made.</i>

1661
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:41,589
The Resurrection Stone.

1662
01:17:46,136 --> 01:17:49,097
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1663
01:17:50,348 --> 01:17:52,600
Together they make
the Deathly Hallows.

1664
01:17:52,684 --> 01:17:56,479
Together they make
one Master of Death.

1665
01:17:57,564 --> 01:17:59,566
The boy who lived.

1666
01:18:02,193 --> 01:18:03,319
Harry!

1667
01:18:09,242 --> 01:18:10,577
<i>Come to die.</i>

1668
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,578
No!

1669
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:16,166
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

1670
01:18:28,803 --> 01:18:32,140
<i>The measures they had taken
to protect their families</i>

1671
01:18:32,223 --> 01:18:35,560
<i>made him realize more than
anything else could have done</i>

1672
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:38,313
<i>that they really were
going to come with him</i>

1673
01:18:38,396 --> 01:18:42,317
<i>and that they knew exactly
how dangerous that would be.</i>

1674
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,111
<i>He wanted to tell them
what that meant to him,</i>

1675
01:18:45,195 --> 01:18:49,365
<i>but he simply could not find
words important enough.</i>

1676
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,335
It's both really cool.

1677
01:19:00,418 --> 01:19:03,588
It's really... and it's weird,
like, walking around here

1678
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:07,008
and seeing the sets
that we were, like, kids on,

1679
01:19:07,091 --> 01:19:08,885
who treated everything
with the amount of respect

1680
01:19:08,968 --> 01:19:10,553
kids treat things when you're
just there and having fun.

1681
01:19:10,637 --> 01:19:11,930
- Yeah.
- It's weird.

1682
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,223
I'm having, like,
weird, nostalgic moments.

1683
01:19:13,306 --> 01:19:14,516
Remember my hamster?

1684
01:19:14,599 --> 01:19:15,558
Does anybody
remember my hamster?

1685
01:19:15,642 --> 01:19:17,018
- Yes.
- Millie.

1686
01:19:17,101 --> 01:19:18,353
Yeah. I didn't remember
the hamster's name.

1687
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:19,729
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1688
01:19:19,813 --> 01:19:21,022
That's okay.
Rest in peace, Millie.

1689
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:22,565
I remember you having
a hamster

1690
01:19:22,649 --> 01:19:24,234
and being vaguely jealous
that you had an animal

1691
01:19:24,317 --> 01:19:26,611
- that was on set with you.
- They made a coffin for it.

1692
01:19:26,694 --> 01:19:28,029
- The carpentry department.
- They did, yeah.

1693
01:19:28,112 --> 01:19:30,240
When Millie died,
the set designers built

1694
01:19:30,323 --> 01:19:33,952
Millie her own
custom-made wooden coffin

1695
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:35,620
that had velvet
on the inside of it.

1696
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:36,871
- It was beautiful.
- Whoa!

1697
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:39,040
And... and it had
her name engraved

1698
01:19:39,123 --> 01:19:41,417
because I was, I mean,
I was beside myself.

1699
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:42,710
Did we do, like, a service?

1700
01:19:42,794 --> 01:19:44,379
I feel like we said
a few words.

1701
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:47,757
I kept wanting to pick up
dead Millie, and, like,

1702
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,926
stroke and touch dead Millie.

1703
01:19:50,009 --> 01:19:51,636
And he was like, "Emma,

1704
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,889
Millie's got to, like,
stay in the coffin now."

1705
01:19:54,973 --> 01:19:57,267
I have forgotten
so much of this.

1706
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,228
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

1707
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:01,813
I know.

1708
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:03,189
We all still look better
than we do in the epilogue.

1709
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:04,899
- Yes.
- I was gonna say.

1710
01:20:04,983 --> 01:20:06,317
Which is great. Like,
we've made it in before that.

1711
01:20:08,862 --> 01:20:10,905
- Bag?
- Yeah.

1712
01:20:10,989 --> 01:20:12,198
Jumper?

1713
01:20:12,282 --> 01:20:15,535
I was all forehead
and a fat suit.

1714
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:17,704
- Yeah, I was very, I was...
- I think I kind of...

1715
01:20:17,787 --> 01:20:19,122
Yeah, you went for it.

1716
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:20,540
You were like,
"Give me the full, give me..."

1717
01:20:20,623 --> 01:20:21,624
I did, yeah.
Give me everything.

1718
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:22,834
Yeah, you went all in.

1719
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:25,336
- Yeah.
- I was so proud of you.

1720
01:20:27,338 --> 01:20:29,340
<i>No one else can really quite
understand</i>

1721
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:31,634
<i>what we experienced;
it's a very unique thing.</i>

1722
01:20:31,718 --> 01:20:34,971
Think David Yates used
to describe us as astronauts

1723
01:20:35,054 --> 01:20:38,975
'cause no one else has really
experienced this in this scale.

1724
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:41,728
And we'll be kind of
forever bonded by that.

1725
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:48,067
<i>Some of
the sweetest memories I have</i>

1726
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:49,694
from the three of us
is just each of us

1727
01:20:49,777 --> 01:20:52,196
knowing we sort of needed
to take care of each other

1728
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,698
in just small ways.

1729
01:20:53,781 --> 01:20:55,617
<i>Just in terms of, like,
it's really cold.</i>

1730
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,953
Like we're all gonna...
we're all gonna stand together

1731
01:20:59,037 --> 01:21:00,580
or I'm knackered.

1732
01:21:00,663 --> 01:21:03,541
Are you okay, Dan,
if I, like, fall asleep on you,

1733
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:07,295
like, in between this take,
'cause I'm so tired or...

1734
01:21:07,378 --> 01:21:09,631
I think we have all
fallen asleep in various

1735
01:21:09,714 --> 01:21:11,049
like on... on each other

1736
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:12,967
in, like, some of
the most grand cathedrals

1737
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:15,720
and things in the UK.

1738
01:21:15,803 --> 01:21:17,472
<i>The level of trust I had</i>

1739
01:21:17,555 --> 01:21:20,642
and that we did build
over those 10 years was like,

1740
01:21:20,725 --> 01:21:22,310
if we were doing a stunt,

1741
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:25,146
<i>I trusted that
one of you would catch me.</i>

1742
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:26,940
<i>I feel like that kind of
trust and reliance</i>

1743
01:21:27,023 --> 01:21:29,067
and that takes, you know,

1744
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,652
there's very few
work environments

1745
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:32,153
where you get that much time
to build that up.

1746
01:21:32,236 --> 01:21:33,905
And it was like nonverbal.
Like it was,

1747
01:21:33,988 --> 01:21:35,740
it was like the three of us
could communicate

1748
01:21:35,823 --> 01:21:38,034
without even having
to say anything.

1749
01:21:38,117 --> 01:21:39,994
We just knew
what needed to be done.

1750
01:21:40,078 --> 01:21:43,414
We were each very strong
for each other.

1751
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,250
Need to change.

1752
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,841
How, Hermione?

1753
01:21:53,925 --> 01:21:55,885
Undetectable extension charm.

1754
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:58,554
You're amazing, you are.

1755
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:01,599
Always the tone of surprise.

1756
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,143
<i>These films had
a very different feel.</i>

1757
01:22:04,227 --> 01:22:05,728
<i>We were away from Hogwarts.</i>

1758
01:22:05,812 --> 01:22:08,898
A lot of the time
camping out different places.

1759
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:10,650
<i>The tone was a lot darker.</i>

1760
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:12,360
<i>It felt like a different film.</i>

1761
01:22:12,443 --> 01:22:14,445
Dumbledore sends you off
to find all these Horcruxes,

1762
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,197
but it doesn't tell you
how to destroy them?

1763
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,907
It's very refreshing,
I think,

1764
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:21,411
'cause we all got to do
some a lot more serious stuff.

1765
01:22:21,494 --> 01:22:23,079
<i>And it was a real opportunity</i>

1766
01:22:23,162 --> 01:22:24,706
to go deeper with these
characters.

1767
01:22:24,789 --> 01:22:26,582
Are you coming,
are you staying?

1768
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:33,548
I saw you two the other night.

1769
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:36,175
Ron, that's... that's nothing.

1770
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:39,470
Ron...

1771
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:42,223
<i>The scene that I thought
was gonna be really awkward</i>

1772
01:22:42,306 --> 01:22:44,058
<i>and I wasn't sure about at all</i>

1773
01:22:44,142 --> 01:22:46,060
which was us doing our dance.

1774
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,229
- Yeah.
- Like I... now that's one

1775
01:22:48,312 --> 01:22:51,649
of my favorite scenes
from the whole of the series,

1776
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,235
<i>because the level
of familiarity that you and I</i>

1777
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:56,237
<i>had with each other,
at that point, I didn't think</i>

1778
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,281
<i>I could have done a scene
like that with another actor.</i>

1779
01:22:58,364 --> 01:22:59,991
Well, it's also an
interesting scene 'cause like,

1780
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,868
first of all, we were doing
Harry Potter films.

1781
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:03,786
And then on the last movie,
the director came and was like,

1782
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,913
"Hey, how about you do
slow dancing to Nick Cave

1783
01:23:05,997 --> 01:23:07,415
for five minutes?"

1784
01:23:07,498 --> 01:23:08,750
We're like, "Wait,
what movie are we working on?"

1785
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,293
Like, "Great, but okay."

1786
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:13,713
<i>♪ I once was blind,
but now I see ♪</i>

1787

1792
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:35,818
<i>There's so much said
in the scene.</i>

1793
01:23:35,902 --> 01:23:37,612
<i>It was unspoken. I loved that.</i>

1794
01:23:37,695 --> 01:23:39,947
<i>And also in the same way
that for the characters,</i>

1795
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:41,657
<i>they got to have
a moment of fun.</i>

1796
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:43,159
<i>I feel like you and I got
to have a moment of fun.</i>

1797
01:23:43,242 --> 01:23:44,619
- Yeah, certainly.
- Which we also...

1798
01:23:44,702 --> 01:23:46,120
Needed at that point.

1799
01:23:46,204 --> 01:23:47,955
- You know?
- Yes, absolutely.

1800
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:51,084
Treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1801
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:52,960
<i>There was that, like... that
scene on the last movie</i>

1802
01:23:53,044 --> 01:23:54,796
where it was like us
running through the forest.

1803
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,297
<i>We were racing through
the woods</i>

1804
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,257
trying not to be caught
by the Snatchers.

1805
01:23:58,341 --> 01:23:59,675
And action.

1806
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:03,805
Well, don't hang about.
Snatch him.

1807
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:06,140
<i>Honestly, I remember
you and I, Emma,</i>

1808
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:07,433
<i>becoming
incredibly competitive...</i>

1809
01:24:07,517 --> 01:24:08,726
<i>Ridiculously competitive.</i>

1810
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,020
About who was
gonna run faster.

1811
01:24:11,104 --> 01:24:12,814
Give me five. That rocked!
Whoo-hoo!

1812
01:24:12,897 --> 01:24:14,565
<i>I feel like
Rupert was always, like,</i>

1813
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,150
<i>a little bit, too, like,
"You guys do what you like."</i>

1814
01:24:16,234 --> 01:24:18,152
He was just like,
"You do your thing."

1815
01:24:18,236 --> 01:24:19,404
- Yeah...
- I be here.

1816
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,489
For me, running is a stunt,

1817
01:24:21,572 --> 01:24:23,157
walking is a stunt.

1818
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:27,495
Oof.

1819
01:24:29,413 --> 01:24:30,998
I absolutely do not like

1820
01:24:31,082 --> 01:24:32,792
watching very many scenes
of myself in that,

1821
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,585
but I've watched you two
and I think you're brilliant.

1822
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:36,504
I remember that was a really
sweet thing, though.

1823
01:24:36,587 --> 01:24:38,923
I do actually remember that the
three of us telling each other

1824
01:24:39,006 --> 01:24:41,134
that we were doing a good job
or that we'd done a scene well.

1825
01:24:41,217 --> 01:24:43,219
Especially 'cause we had
started off young

1826
01:24:43,302 --> 01:24:44,720
and really not knowing
what we were doing.

1827
01:24:44,804 --> 01:24:46,347
So that when we'd see
each other do

1828
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:48,141
like a bit of real acting,
you'd go, "Oh, cool."

1829
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:49,851
- "That was... that's was cool."
- Yeah, "Well done."

1830
01:24:49,934 --> 01:24:51,310
Like, yeah that was... I guess
we're all getting better.

1831
01:24:51,394 --> 01:24:52,478
- Crushed it.
- Great. Well done.

1832
01:24:52,562 --> 01:24:54,063
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean.

1833
01:24:54,147 --> 01:24:58,734
Obviously, us kissing
was the most horrifying thing

1834
01:24:58,818 --> 01:25:00,153
- either of us...
- Oh.

1835
01:25:00,236 --> 01:25:02,446
- Yeah.
- Have ever had to go through.

1836
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,744
I'm Hermione Granger.

1837
01:25:08,828 --> 01:25:11,372
And you are?

1838
01:25:11,455 --> 01:25:14,250
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

1839
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:18,671
"It's levi-ohh-sa,"
not levio-sahh."

1840
01:25:18,754 --> 01:25:20,923
She's a nightmare, honestly.

1841
01:25:21,007 --> 01:25:23,050
No wonder she hasn't got
any friends.

1842
01:25:24,844 --> 01:25:26,387
I think she heard you.

1843
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,598
It was just built up so much
for the whole series.

1844
01:25:28,681 --> 01:25:29,849
Eight films.

1845
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:31,559
I love Ron
and Hermione's romance

1846
01:25:31,642 --> 01:25:34,228
<i>and the way
that sort of just bubbles away</i>

1847
01:25:34,312 --> 01:25:36,147
<i>under the story constantly.</i>

1848
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:37,857
Uh... um...

1849
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:46,490
<i>This relationship has been
so restrained for so long.</i>

1850
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,409
Got a bit of toothpaste.

1851
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:52,914
Slughorn's having
Christmas, too, you know.

1852
01:25:52,997 --> 01:25:54,332
And we're meant
to bring someone.

1853
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:56,250
I expect you'll be
bringing McLaggen?

1854
01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:59,712
<i>The audience are desperate
to see these two kiss.</i>

1855
01:25:59,795 --> 01:26:01,422
Actually,
I was going to ask you.

1856
01:26:01,505 --> 01:26:03,090
Really?

1857
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:05,009
<i>There's a scene that we
should... it's nice and sweet</i>

1858
01:26:05,092 --> 01:26:06,511
<i>that we should talk about
once you've read it.</i>

1859
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:07,803
'Cause we'll be doing the kiss
this week

1860
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:09,347
- between Ron and Hermione.
- What?

1861
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:10,806
Doing the kiss between
Ron and Hermione in...

1862
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:12,099
- This week?
- This week?

1863
01:26:12,183 --> 01:26:14,101
In the chambers of secrets.

1864
01:26:14,185 --> 01:26:16,896
<i>In this moment
of extraordinary jeopardy,</i>

1865
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:20,316
<i>they turn to each other
and then they just kiss.</i>

1866
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:26,072
<i>We've waited
seven movies for this.</i>

1867
01:26:26,155 --> 01:26:28,407
I spoke to both of them
in their trailers,

1868
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:30,618
<i>made sure
they were both comfortable.</i>

1869
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:34,497
<i>It was almost like prepping
them for a major sports event.</i>

1870
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,707
<i>You know, saying,
"Okay guys, you can do this.</i>

1871
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,459
<i>It's gonna be great."</i>

1872
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:41,128
It was meant to be, like,
this, like, dramatic make out.

1873
01:26:41,212 --> 01:26:42,630
'Cause you and I
just kept corpsing...

1874
01:26:42,713 --> 01:26:44,090
- like, we just kept laughing.
- Yeah, yeah.

1875
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:45,466
And I was just
really scared

1876
01:26:45,549 --> 01:26:46,842
we were never gonna
get it because...

1877
01:26:46,926 --> 01:26:48,177
We couldn't take
it seriously.

1878
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:51,931
I did not make this better
because I've been told

1879
01:26:52,014 --> 01:26:54,308
significantly that I was
just being an absolute dick

1880
01:26:54,392 --> 01:26:55,768
about this and was like,

1881
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:57,478
"I'm gonna come on set
and watch you guys kiss."

1882
01:26:57,561 --> 01:26:59,355
Well, everyone wanted to be
on set for it.

1883
01:26:59,438 --> 01:27:01,857
'Cause everyone was like,
"This is gonna be good, guys."

1884
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:03,484
- Like we need...
- I'm sorry about that, guys.

1885
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:04,986
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1886
01:27:05,069 --> 01:27:06,821
I knew I was gonna kind of
have to be the one

1887
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:08,698
to kinda make this thing happen

1888
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:12,535
<i>because Rupert was not gonna,
so I just had to go for it.</i>

1889
01:27:12,618 --> 01:27:14,245
Taking no prisoners.

1890
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:17,623
I needed like, momentum into
the kiss in order to do it.

1891
01:27:17,707 --> 01:27:20,626
And Rupert's, I could almost
on that first take,

1892
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:24,338
I saw Rupert's face
explode with surprise,

1893
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:26,424
'cause he thought,
"It's only the first take."

1894
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,509
Kinda think I blacked out.
I just remember

1895
01:27:28,592 --> 01:27:31,512
your face getting
closer and closer to mine.

1896
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:33,055
<i>Every time you talk
about this,</i>

1897
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:35,474
you make it sound
like an actual horror show

1898
01:27:35,558 --> 01:27:36,517
in your head.

1899
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,894
It wasn't that bad. I know.

1900
01:27:50,281 --> 01:27:52,742
<i>Kissing Rupert
is one of the hardest things</i>

1901
01:27:52,825 --> 01:27:54,452
<i>I've ever had to do.</i>

1902
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:57,330
<i>It just felt wrong,</i>

1903
01:27:57,413 --> 01:27:59,206
<i>so wrong on every level</i>

1904
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:02,335
because Dan, Rupert, and I
are so much siblings.

1905
01:28:06,464 --> 01:28:07,715
Harry?

1906
01:28:07,798 --> 01:28:09,383
<i>All three of us,
I think, felt so matched</i>

1907
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:12,303
in how much it meant to us.

1908
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:15,473
<i>I remember the scene
when you were like, "No, guys,</i>

1909
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,391
<i>I'm the one who has to go
on my own kinda thing</i>

1910
01:28:17,475 --> 01:28:19,226
on this... this one."

1911
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:20,728
And I gave you the hug to say
goodbye.

1912
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:23,356
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

1913
01:28:25,816 --> 01:28:28,736
<i>I knew I was saying
goodbye to the series.</i>

1914
01:28:28,819 --> 01:28:30,613
<i>I knew I was saying
goodbye to you.</i>

1915
01:28:30,696 --> 01:28:33,032
<i>And I just had to just
bring to the surface</i>

1916
01:28:33,115 --> 01:28:38,204
how I really felt
about it all coming to an end.

1917
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:39,705
Yeah.

1918
01:28:51,676 --> 01:28:53,052
<i>It's a very biblical image</i>

1919
01:28:53,135 --> 01:28:55,096
<i>carrying Harry
across the bridge.</i>

1920
01:28:57,848 --> 01:29:01,102
<i>If you ask Jo or anyone
who's deeply involved in it,</i>

1921
01:29:01,185 --> 01:29:03,938
<i>they'll just say it's the
battle between good and evil.</i>

1922
01:29:04,021 --> 01:29:05,481
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

1923
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:11,695
<i>I owe so much to Neville
as a character.</i>

1924
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:13,239
<i>I was very, very shy,
I wouldn't...</i>

1925
01:29:13,322 --> 01:29:14,865
<i>I would never
speak up in class.</i>

1926
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:16,158
<i>I wouldn't put my hand up
for anything</i>

1927
01:29:16,242 --> 01:29:18,911
<i>'cause I-I very much was him.</i>

1928
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:24,250
Great story of Neville
is that he's the champion.

1929
01:29:26,377 --> 01:29:27,920
<i>That wonderful bit
at the end.</i>

1930
01:29:28,003 --> 01:29:29,964
That great speech
of Matthew's, you know.

1931
01:29:31,882 --> 01:29:33,759
Good must prevail, of course.

1932
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,137
It doesn't matter
that Harry's gone.

1933
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:37,596
Stand down, Neville.

1934
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,807
People die every day.

1935
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:41,642
We lost Harry tonight.

1936
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:47,481
He's still with us in here.

1937
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:51,902
He didn't die in vain.

1938
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,654
<i>But the thing
that Harry Potter did for me,</i>

1939
01:29:53,737 --> 01:29:57,533
<i>both as a... as a story
and as an actor in it...</i>

1940
01:29:57,616 --> 01:29:59,160
But you will.

1941
01:29:59,243 --> 01:30:01,537
<i>Was that it helped me
to find first what I'm not.</i>

1942
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:05,166
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us.

1943
01:30:05,249 --> 01:30:08,586
<i>Which, therefore,
by extension, found what I am.</i>

1944
01:30:10,588 --> 01:30:12,423
<i>Confrigo!</i>

1945
01:30:21,599 --> 01:30:23,726
<i>We're looking at the book,
the final confrontation</i>

1946
01:30:23,809 --> 01:30:25,853
between Voldemort and Harry.

1947
01:30:25,936 --> 01:30:27,229
<i>It takes place
in the Great Hall</i>

1948
01:30:27,313 --> 01:30:29,398
<i>with a huge audience watching.</i>

1949
01:30:29,482 --> 01:30:32,943
And I really wanted something
earthier and more intense

1950
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:35,446
<i>and more visceral than that.</i>

1951
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:39,408
Because these two adversaries
were almost joined

1952
01:30:39,492 --> 01:30:43,871
spiritually, if you like,
in this strange, horcrux-y way,

1953
01:30:43,954 --> 01:30:45,581
<i>I thought, wouldn't
it be wonderful</i>

1954
01:30:45,664 --> 01:30:50,044
if Dan just grabbed Ralph
and pulled him off this tower?

1955
01:30:50,127 --> 01:30:53,380
Come on, Tom, let's finish
this the way we started it.

1956
01:30:53,464 --> 01:30:55,216
Together.

1957
01:30:55,299 --> 01:30:57,718
<i>As they apparate,
they merge together</i>

1958
01:30:57,801 --> 01:30:59,887
<i>that deep connection
that we'd sort of</i>

1959
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:03,015
<i>threaded through the stories
and the films,</i>

1960
01:31:03,098 --> 01:31:04,683
<i>you'd visualize in that moment</i>

1961
01:31:04,767 --> 01:31:07,102
before they tumbled down
into the courtyard.

1962
01:31:11,273 --> 01:31:12,691
<i>I remember being
quite physically tired.</i>

1963
01:31:12,775 --> 01:31:14,068
We put everything into it.

1964
01:31:14,151 --> 01:31:15,694
We were exhausted,
I think, at the end.

1965
01:31:15,778 --> 01:31:17,571
<i>We were shooting
in cold months</i>

1966
01:31:17,655 --> 01:31:18,697
<i>and the skies were gray.</i>

1967
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:20,407
<i>My forearm got so tight</i>

1968
01:31:20,491 --> 01:31:22,451
<i>'cause this thing,
this running current in you,</i>

1969
01:31:22,535 --> 01:31:24,787
you had to...

1970
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:26,205
<i>push it back at him.</i>

1971
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,459
<i>As well as the physical
challenge of making the films,</i>

1972
01:31:30,543 --> 01:31:33,003
there was that small pressure
of thinking,

1973
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,755
"You're the one
who's gonna finish this.

1974
01:31:34,838 --> 01:31:37,758
<i>"It has to go out on a high.
It has to be meaningful.</i>

1975
01:31:37,841 --> 01:31:41,095
<i>It has to resonate.
It has to deliver."</i>

1976
01:32:30,644 --> 01:32:33,480
- Who are you?
- Hello, my name is Emma Watson

1977
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:35,441
playing the part
of Hermione Granger.

1978
01:32:35,524 --> 01:32:37,985
- I'm horrified.
- No, never.

1979
01:32:38,068 --> 01:32:39,820
- What?
- Never mind.

1980
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:41,196
You rather not
be seen like this?

1981
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,740
- Yeah.
- Why?

1982
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:44,325
'Cause he doesn't like
the clip in his hair.

1983
01:32:44,408 --> 01:32:46,160
- Yeah.
- Mr. Radcliffe.

1984
01:32:46,243 --> 01:32:47,953
- Yep. Ah!
- Ah?

1985
01:32:48,037 --> 01:32:49,413
Camera, ah!

1986
01:32:49,496 --> 01:32:50,873
You're from the press?

1987
01:32:50,956 --> 01:32:52,958
I'm from the press, exactly.
How did you know?

1988
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:55,002
It's your first day.
How does it feel?

1989
01:32:55,085 --> 01:32:57,338
It feels
absolutely fantastic.

1990
01:32:57,421 --> 01:32:58,547
Are you excited?

1991
01:32:58,631 --> 01:33:01,634
Very much so. Can't wait.

1992
01:33:01,717 --> 01:33:04,928
After all this preparation,
finally happening.

1993
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,598
Okay, get back to work.
People need to pamper you.

1994
01:33:07,681 --> 01:33:09,141
- Yeah.
- Right.

1995
01:33:13,812 --> 01:33:15,689
<i>What do you think about when
you think about it now, Rup?</i>

1996
01:33:15,773 --> 01:33:16,982
<i>As you look back on...</i>

1997
01:33:17,066 --> 01:33:18,233
like, for me,
it's very good memories.

1998
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:19,610
Like, what is it for you?

1999
01:33:19,693 --> 01:33:21,278
I'm very proud
to have been part of them.

2000
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:23,906
I think towards the end
it was kind of a weird time,

2001
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:25,866
especially kind of finishing.

2002
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:27,534
I felt like I lost track

2003
01:33:27,618 --> 01:33:29,703
of who I was
and who the character was.

2004
01:33:29,787 --> 01:33:32,373
I didn't really know
where they ended or began.

2005
01:33:32,456 --> 01:33:33,791
Yeah, there were some things
that I'm just like,

2006
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:34,833
who... who am I?

2007
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:35,918
Like, what do I like to do?

2008
01:33:36,001 --> 01:33:37,336
What... what is important to me?

2009
01:33:37,419 --> 01:33:38,629
Like, it was weird things.

2010
01:33:38,712 --> 01:33:39,922
Even my name
didn't feel like my name.

2011
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:41,256
- Yeah.
- I felt I only

2012
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:42,549
really knew
how to do one thing.

2013
01:33:42,633 --> 01:33:43,967
- Yeah.
- I knew how to play Ron.

2014
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,427
Ron was my favorite character,

2015
01:33:45,511 --> 01:33:47,721
so it was so cool
being him in the film.

2016
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:49,223
<i>It's almost like we did</i>

2017
01:33:49,306 --> 01:33:52,976
<i>the most extreme form
of method acting.</i>

2018
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,978
<i>It always had to end
at some point.</i>

2019
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:58,565
We were never gonna
be doing this forever.

2020
01:33:58,649 --> 01:34:00,401
The way it feels for me now,

2021
01:34:00,484 --> 01:34:03,570
like, seeing you here,
having had time apart...

2022
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:06,448
Let me try not
to get emotional.

2023
01:34:06,532 --> 01:34:09,159
It feels like you're like
a pillar of my life.

2024
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:10,411
That's a very
overwhelming thing,

2025
01:34:10,494 --> 01:34:11,829
'cause I've watched you
grow up.

2026
01:34:11,912 --> 01:34:12,913
We've watched each other
grow up.

2027
01:34:12,996 --> 01:34:14,123
We grew up together.

2028
01:34:14,206 --> 01:34:16,458
We're family.
We always will be.

2029
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:19,461
We don't need to see each...
oh, my God.

2030
01:34:19,545 --> 01:34:23,507
Even though we don't see
each other all the time.

2031
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,342
Yeah, it's a...

2032
01:34:26,802 --> 01:34:28,053
It's a strong...

2033
01:34:28,137 --> 01:34:29,680
a strong bond
that we will always have.

2034
01:34:29,763 --> 01:34:33,767
And we will always be part
of each other's lives.

2035
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:47,531
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- So good to see you.

2036
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,701
I love you.

2037
01:34:56,707 --> 01:34:57,791
As a friend.

2038
01:35:00,377 --> 01:35:01,962
- Just to be clear.
- Just to be clear.

2039
01:35:02,045 --> 01:35:03,630
For everyone watching.

2040
01:35:03,714 --> 01:35:06,967
But it's true.
There's so much love.

2041
01:35:07,051 --> 01:35:08,594
Oh, thanks, Rupes.

2042
01:35:08,677 --> 01:35:10,137
Let's do a rehearsal,

2043
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:12,681
and it can playback I need
to playback from the top.

2044
01:35:12,765 --> 01:35:14,892
When you're ready, and action.

2045
01:35:16,018 --> 01:35:18,771
<i>When we were all wrapping up
those final scenes,</i>

2046
01:35:18,854 --> 01:35:23,150
<i>one of the last shots
we did in the entire shoot.</i>

2047
01:35:23,233 --> 01:35:25,611
<i>We were diving past
the camera</i>

2048
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:28,655
and landing
on this huge crash mat.

2049
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,325
That was what it all
came down to, this one take.

2050
01:35:31,408 --> 01:35:33,494
It was jumping in a chimney.

2051
01:35:33,577 --> 01:35:36,997
<i>It was such a metaphor for
what was actually happening.</i>

2052
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,833
<i>We had to, like, jump
onto a mat, basically,</i>

2053
01:35:39,917 --> 01:35:41,960
to travel into another world.

2054
01:35:42,878 --> 01:35:46,381
<i>The collective emotion
was incredibly palpable</i>

2055
01:35:46,465 --> 01:35:48,217
<i>and... and for the people
who'd supported them</i>

2056
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,302
<i>and had been there
for them throughout.</i>

2057
01:35:50,385 --> 01:35:53,972
<i>Everybody who'd
seen them grow up.</i>

2058
01:35:57,768 --> 01:36:00,229
<i>On that last day,
I just lost it.</i>

2059
01:36:02,648 --> 01:36:05,275
<i>I mean, I remember all of us
just holding each other.</i>

2060
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:12,032
All three of us
were, like, utterly devastated.

2061
01:36:14,409 --> 01:36:16,537
<i>I think it was the first time
we'd allowed ourselves</i>

2062
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:21,041
to even process
or realize we'd done it.

2063
01:36:21,124 --> 01:36:22,960
<i>We'd made it through.</i>

2064
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:24,628
<i>It's so ingrained
in me as well,</i>

2065
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:27,422
<i>like I measure
my life with these movies.</i>

2066
01:36:27,506 --> 01:36:29,550
So it's like, "Oh, when did you
pass your driving test?"

2067
01:36:29,633 --> 01:36:32,344
I'm like,
"Order of the Phoenix."

2068
01:36:32,427 --> 01:36:37,099
<i>Every part of my life
is connected to Potter.</i>

2069
01:36:38,976 --> 01:36:41,687
When I meet people who
it's a really important part

2070
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:44,398
of their life, or the books
or the films were in some way,

2071
01:36:44,481 --> 01:36:46,066
like, a part of their identity,

2072
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:48,735
it, yeah,
it just makes you really proud.

2073
01:36:48,819 --> 01:36:50,988
There's something
about Harry Potter

2074
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:52,739
that makes life richer.

2075
01:36:52,823 --> 01:36:55,993
Like, when things get really
dark and times are really hard,

2076
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:58,412
stories give us places
we can go

2077
01:36:58,495 --> 01:37:03,000
where we can rest
and feel held.

2078
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,751
I don't think I fully
appreciated the reach

2079
01:37:04,835 --> 01:37:07,212
that these films had
when we were in them.

2080
01:37:07,296 --> 01:37:08,922
The amount of people
that have said things like,

2081
01:37:09,006 --> 01:37:10,924
"These are the only films
my dad and I watched together.

2082
01:37:11,008 --> 01:37:12,467
"Like, we can't talk
about anything else.

2083
01:37:12,551 --> 01:37:13,927
"And like,
we watch Harry Potter together.

2084
01:37:14,011 --> 01:37:15,470
And that has been our thing."

2085
01:37:15,554 --> 01:37:18,849
It's amazing to... to be
a small kind of part of that.

2086
01:37:18,932 --> 01:37:22,102
And just seeing it kinda
relive on, finding new mediums,

2087
01:37:22,185 --> 01:37:24,229
like the stage show,
"Fantastic Beasts."

2088
01:37:24,313 --> 01:37:26,940
It's just kind of
living forever,

2089
01:37:27,024 --> 01:37:28,942
and it's amazing to see it.

2090
01:37:29,026 --> 01:37:31,737
Harry Potter! Harry Potter!

2091
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:34,948
There's nothing like
the stories of Harry Potter.

2092
01:37:35,032 --> 01:37:36,325
The stories told within them,

2093
01:37:36,408 --> 01:37:38,535
the individual
characters' journeys.

2094
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:40,120
<i>I just think that has such</i>

2095
01:37:40,203 --> 01:37:42,497
<i>a transformative effect
on people.</i>

2096
01:37:42,581 --> 01:37:43,498
<i>That's magic.</i>

2097
01:37:43,582 --> 01:37:44,958
It's beautiful here.

2098
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:48,962
Every child wonders how
they're going to fit in.

2099
01:37:49,046 --> 01:37:52,466
And it's an epic journey
that every child goes on.

2100
01:37:52,549 --> 01:37:54,885
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

2101
01:37:54,968 --> 01:37:57,137
It's very inspiring
for young people to go,

2102
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,681
"Oh, that could be me there
having that moment of doubt

2103
01:37:59,765 --> 01:38:02,726
or that wobble or that argument
with my parents."

2104
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:06,313
Stay close to me.

2105
01:38:06,396 --> 01:38:08,357
Until the end.

2106
01:38:09,566 --> 01:38:12,402
I have found it
an extraordinary world

2107
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:13,862
to be involved with.

2108
01:38:13,946 --> 01:38:16,573
And it's a...
it's a beautiful world.

2109
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:17,616
Harry.

2110
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:19,117
Harry.

2111
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:20,661
Harry.

2112
01:38:20,744 --> 01:38:22,663
<i>And that's what's so
profoundly therapeutic</i>

2113
01:38:22,746 --> 01:38:25,040
and good about it, is it's made

2114
01:38:25,123 --> 01:38:27,834
people who otherwise
feel lonely,

2115
01:38:27,918 --> 01:38:29,419
<i>they feel they belong.</i>

2116
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:31,380
- Don't give it to her, Harry.
- Shh.

2117
01:38:33,215 --> 01:38:35,008
Most of the fans
that... that come up

2118
01:38:35,092 --> 01:38:36,343
and say hello to me now

2119
01:38:36,426 --> 01:38:38,178
weren't even born
when we made the films.

2120
01:38:38,261 --> 01:38:43,058
So it quickly makes you feel
slightly older

2121
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:45,769
and very grateful

2122
01:38:45,852 --> 01:38:49,398
that it's been passed down
to other generations.

2123
01:38:49,481 --> 01:38:51,441
Training for the ballet,
Potter?'

2124
01:38:55,404 --> 01:38:57,531
One of the things that
was unique about Harry Potter,

2125
01:38:57,614 --> 01:39:00,075
besides the incredible
imagination of worlds

2126
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:03,870
<i>and characters
that Jo Rowling created</i>

2127
01:39:03,954 --> 01:39:07,207
<i>was the fact that you get
to see young children</i>

2128
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:10,043
<i>grow into adults</i>

2129
01:39:10,127 --> 01:39:12,129
<i>and to see
that journey on film.</i>

2130
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:14,548
<i>I don't think we've ever
seen that before.</i>

2131
01:39:14,631 --> 01:39:16,258
<i>I don't know
if we'll ever see it again.</i>

2132
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:18,677
<i>It just feel so lucky
that I get to be part</i>

2133
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:23,223
of a world that people love
so much and makes people happy.

2134
01:39:23,306 --> 01:39:24,433
There's something
about those...

2135
01:39:24,516 --> 01:39:26,184
the escapism you find.

2136
01:39:26,268 --> 01:39:28,103
<i>The healthy form of escapism.</i>

2137
01:39:28,186 --> 01:39:31,064
<i>That, I think, is kind of
what Harry Potter does.</i>

2138
01:39:31,148 --> 01:39:32,733
And that's what these stories
are for.

2139
01:39:32,816 --> 01:39:34,901
They are a guide
to how to live.

2140
01:39:34,985 --> 01:39:36,278
I just think
it's an end of an era.

2141
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:37,946
It's a ten... ten years
of my life.

2142
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:41,033
My... my children are grown up
during this, of course.

2143
01:39:41,116 --> 01:39:44,953
That is Robbie Coltrane,
finest gamekeeper in Hogwarts,

2144
01:39:45,037 --> 01:39:46,747
last day on Harry Potter.

2145
01:39:51,835 --> 01:39:53,879
<i>The legacy of the movies
is, I suspect,</i>

2146
01:39:53,962 --> 01:39:55,756
<i>that my children's generation</i>

2147
01:39:55,839 --> 01:39:58,341
<i>will show them
to their children.</i>

2148
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:01,344
So you could be watching it
in 50 years' time, easy.

2149
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:05,432
I'll not be here, sadly, but...

2150
01:40:06,141 --> 01:40:08,935
Don't you think on it
for one minute.

2151
01:40:09,019 --> 01:40:11,897
But Hagrid will, yes.

2152
01:40:13,356 --> 01:40:16,485
<i>Kinda looking back
at it now,</i>

2153
01:40:16,568 --> 01:40:17,986
<i>just really fond memories.</i>

2154
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:20,489
I think about it a lot.
It was a great time.

2155
01:40:20,572 --> 01:40:22,532
It really was, it was...

2156
01:40:22,616 --> 01:40:24,326
<i>it was amazing.</i>

2157
01:40:24,409 --> 01:40:29,039
Just the best,
most amazing experience.

2158
01:40:29,122 --> 01:40:32,542
And I can't
really explain to you...

2159
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:34,836
like, they're such good people.

2160
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,297
<i>They were so kind, and...</i>

2161
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,550
they both took the
responsibility very seriously.

2162
01:40:40,634 --> 01:40:44,596
And I appreciated that so much.

2163
01:40:44,679 --> 01:40:46,014
<i>It really is like family.</i>

2164
01:40:46,098 --> 01:40:48,934
<i>We're just
so intrinsically linked.</i>

2165
01:40:50,102 --> 01:40:52,145
They're very important
people to me.

2166
01:40:53,063 --> 01:40:55,315
<i>The crew on these films
were unbelievable.</i>

2167
01:40:55,398 --> 01:40:59,027
There are people
on these films that are...

2168
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:03,907
are foundational to who I am...

2169
01:41:06,409 --> 01:41:09,663
As a person and an actor.

2170
01:41:09,746 --> 01:41:11,665
<i>I feel so lucky
to be where I am</i>

2171
01:41:11,748 --> 01:41:13,417
<i>and to have the life
that I have</i>

2172
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,211
and be able to work with
the people I work with now,

2173
01:41:16,294 --> 01:41:20,382
but none of it is possible
without this.

2174
01:41:20,465 --> 01:41:24,928
So yeah, it was... it was very...

2175
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:26,972
it was a very good ten years.

2176
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,728
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

2177
01:41:45,031 --> 01:41:47,826
After all this time?

2178
01:41:47,909 --> 01:41:49,953
Always.

2179
01:42:04,268 --> 01:42:09,268
