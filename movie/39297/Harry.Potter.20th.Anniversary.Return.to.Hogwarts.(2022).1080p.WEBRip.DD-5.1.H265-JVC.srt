00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,937
"His parents do not want him
involved in this world.

160
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,480
They don't want him
to take this role."

161
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,315
I think the deal
was to sign on for, like,

162
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,526
all seven films and they would
be filmed in LA.

163
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:57,236
So Mum and Dad were like,
"No, that's, like,

164
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,863
a huge disruption to his life."

165
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,323
Fortunately, David Heyman,

166
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,993
uh, went to the theater
a few weeks later.

167
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,828
These two guys
in the row in front of me

168
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,329
started sort of turning round.

169
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,457
<i>David, being the great
producer that he is,</i>

170
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,335
convinced Dan's father to bring
Dan in for an audition.

171
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,298
And that's basically
when we got our Harry Potter.

172
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:18,883
And action.

173
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,676
- That's a dragon egg.
- What is it?

174
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,511
- That's what that is.
- What is that?

175
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,637
A dragon egg.

176
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:24,805
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

177
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,182
I was a very happy kid who had

178
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,184
a really haunted quality,
apparently.

179
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,686
"You're really sweet,
but you looked like

180
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,022
you had real, like,
stuff going on."

181
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,025
It was very emotional,
actually, seeing this kid

182
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,943
sitting there talking,
and I just thought,

183
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,029
"Yeah, that's him.
Thank God we found him."

184
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,365
Rupert and Emma
were very easy to cast

185
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,284
because they felt like
they jumped off the page.

186
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,036
<i>We screen-tested
the three of them together</i>

187
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,038
<i>to make sure that
they all had this chemistry,</i>

188
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,707
which immediately was obvious
in the first screen test.

189
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,667
Remember, guys,
get closer to her

190
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:55,419
as she finds out
the information.

191
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:57,004
And action.

192
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:00,549
I never thought
to look in here.

193
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,886
I checked this out first term
for a bit of light reading.

194
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,555
- This is light?
- Shut up.

195
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,350
If Filch comes around
the corner any second now,

196
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:12,353
at least 50 points
off Gryffindor.

197
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:18,025
I knew it! Here it is.

198
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:20,569
Nicholas Flamel
is the only known

199
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,572
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

200
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,074
both: The what?

201
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,743
Oh, honestly,
don't you two read?

202
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,870
Cut. Good job.

203
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,039
It's lovely seeing you.

204
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,041
Yeah, this is surreal,
isn't it?

205
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:36,877
How do we all feel being back
and talking about this?

206
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:40,005
Well, A, really emotional,
obviously.

207
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,050
And B, um, it feels like
no time has passed

208
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,220
and loads of time has passed
simultaneously.

209
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:47,805
Yeah, kind of much the same.
It's quite surreal.

210
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,015
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

211
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,851
It doesn't feel like we've
kind of earned a reunion yet.

212
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,228
- Yeah.
- I know.

213
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,355
I have had kidney stones
and a baby,

214
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,773
so time has obviously passed.
[laughter]

215
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,692
- You did mention that.
- I feel my age.

216
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,736
But there is, like,
such a collection

217
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,613
of, like, shared memories
and stuff

218
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,115
that we just all did together
that it is

219
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,783
immediately
very easy to be, like...

220
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,451
to sort of slip back
into where you were.

221
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,996
Our first audition, the...
the day we all met...

222
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,873
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- I think for the first time,

223
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,624
there was, like, me walking
out of my dressing room

224
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,585
and seeing, like,
another, like,

225
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,461
young, brown-haired boy
going the other way.

226
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,838
I never saw his face,
but I was like,

227
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,131
"You are clearly another Harry

228
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,632
that is being
tested out today."

229
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,217
- And they were, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,802
Testing us with various
different configurations

231
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:27,886
of Ron, Harry, and Hermione.

232
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,305
I remember there was one

233
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,098
where they put all
the three of us together.

234
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:33,934
I do remember that
when it was the three of us,

235
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,770
- something felt different...
- Right. Yeah.

236
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:39,481
And, like, right and easy.
I do remember the click.

237
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,275
<i>We'd been out
at the studios.</i>

238
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,694
They'd told us we got the parts
and they were like, "Cool.

239
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,529
"So we're announcing
you've got the parts.

240
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,324
There is now going to be a lot
of media outside your house."

241
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,575
So you can't go home."

242
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,035
So far, it's sort of

243
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,912
turned things upside down.
[laughter]

244
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,332
Um, it's... I don't know,

245
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,126
I've never had anything
happen to me like this before.

246
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:02,171
Hermione made
complete sense to me.

247
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,797
<i>That's me.</i>

248
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,507
<i>Like, I am that girl.</i>

249
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,511
Well, Emma was arguably
the smartest person on the set,

250
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,096
and I'm talking
about everybody.

251
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,557
She just was...
she was a brilliant kid.

252
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:16,060
I think I'm scarily
like my character.

253
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:17,895
[laughter]

254
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:20,856
'Cause I live in a family
of, um, seven

255
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,067
and, um, I've got
a redheaded sister

256
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,443
and I live in a burrow.

257
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,945
Rupert is just the most
camera-ready

258
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,531
12-year-old boy in the world
at that point.

259
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,078
Like, he was so,
like, just fearless.

260
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,206
Rupert was Ron, you know,

261
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,625
and Dan kind of was Harry.

262
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,877
How do you feel
about becoming famous?

263
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,296
It'd be cool.
[laughter]

264
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,798
We were all talking about this,

265
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,384
how comfortable you made us all
in our auditions

266
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,635
and how, like, this, like,

267
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:51,762
extended massively
into the set.

268
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,556
My memory of it is that
it seemed effortless to you.

269
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,851
Well, on the first film,
I was dying the entire time,

270
00:12:57,935 --> 00:12:59,728
but I just... I always believe

271
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,605
you cannot bring
that kind of anxiety.

272
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,440
I want everyone
to feel comfortable.

273
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,150
I want everyone
to feel like it's a family.

274
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,069
I want everyone
to feel like they're home.

grab hold of this,

290
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,703
they kept us having fun
the whole time.

291
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:59,788
Obviously, we were just kids,
and we were all

We were very much just, like,
kids being kids on a set.

296
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,591
- Mm-hmm.
- My residing memory

297
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:13,010
from the first...
from "Philosopher's Stone"

298
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,803
is I just learned
how to play slam.

299
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,222
You know what we did a lot of
as well was that game.

300
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,515
- Oh, my God.
- Slaps.

301
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,975
- So much hand slaps.
- Oh, slaps.

302
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,393
With, like, all of us,
like, red...

303
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:23,145
like, red, raw hands
from, like,

304
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,646
- hitting each other really hard.
- I think we also upgraded

305
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,815
- to knuckles as well.
- Oh, and shins.

306
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,233
- Yeah.
- I remember the shin version.

307
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,068
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

308
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,822
Sorry. Gotta give it back.

<i>The hardest scene to shoot
was Quidditch.</i>

467
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,488
And the audience had to

468
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,989
understand the rules
immediately.

469
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,534
Quidditch is easy enough
to understand.

470
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:14,162
Each team has seven players:
three chasers, two beaters,

471
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,832
one keeper,
and the seeker... that's you.

472
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,210
So Jo Rowling basically did
a rule book for us.

473
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,586
A Quidditch rule book

474
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,840
explaining every detail
of the game.

475
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,800
<i>Then, with Stuart Craig,
our production designer,</i>

476
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:29,010
<i>designed the look
of the Quidditch pitch</i>

477
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:34,015
<i>and really create a pitch
that felt authentic and real</i>

478
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,018
<i>for a game
that is completely unreal.</i>

479
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,021
Lots of energy, enthusiasm.

you know,

485
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,323
on day two maybe or three,

486
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:53,034
the camera pushes into you
and you say,

487
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,578
"We're not going home,
not really."

488
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:58,165
Feels strange to be
going home, doesn't it?

01:19:08,818 --> 01:19:10,403
kids treat things when you're
just there and having fun.

1850
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:11,780
- Yeah.
- It's weird.

1851
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:13,073
I'm having, like,
weird, nostalgic moments.

1852
01:19:13,156 --> 01:19:14,366
Remember my hamster?

1853
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,408
Does anybody
remember my hamster?

1854
01:19:15,492 --> 01:19:16,868
- Yes.
- Millie.

1855
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:18,203
Yeah. I didn't remember
the hamster's name.

1856
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,579
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1857
01:19:19,663 --> 01:19:20,872
That's okay.
Rest in peace, Millie.

1858
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,415
I remember you having
a hamster

1859
01:19:22,499 --> 01:19:24,084
and being vaguely jealous
that you had an animal

1860
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:26,461
- that was on set with you.
- They made a coffin for it.

1861
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:27,879
- The carpentry department.
- They did, yeah.

1862
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:30,090
When Millie died,
the set designers built

1863
01:19:30,173 --> 01:19:33,802
Millie her own
custom-made wooden coffin

1864
01:19:33,885 --> 01:19:35,470
that had velvet
on the inside of it.

1865
01:19:35,553 --> 01:19:36,721
- It was beautiful.
- Whoa!

1866
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,890
And... and it had
her name engraved

1867
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:41,267
because I was, I mean,
I was beside myself.

1868
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:42,560
Did we do, like, a service?

1869
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,229
I feel like we said
a few words.

1870
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:47,607
I kept wanting to pick up
dead Millie, and, like,

1871
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:49,776
stroke and touch dead Millie.

1872
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:51,486
And he was like, "Emma,

1873
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:54,739
Millie's got to, like,
stay in the coffin now."

1874
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,117
I have forgotten
so much of this.

1875
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,078
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

1876
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:01,663
I know.

1877
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,039
We all still look better
than we do in the epilogue.

1878
01:20:03,123 --> 01:20:04,749
- Yes.
- I was gonna say.

1879
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,167
Which is great. Like,
we've made it in before that.

1880
01:20:08,712 --> 01:20:10,755
- Bag?
- Yeah.

1881
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:12,048
Jumper?

1882
01:20:12,132 --> 01:20:15,385
I was all forehead
and a fat suit.

1883
01:20:15,468 --> 01:20:17,554
- Yeah, I was very, I was...
- I think I kind of...

1884
01:20:17,637 --> 01:20:18,972
Yeah, you went for it.

1885
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:20,390
You were like,
"Give me the full, give me..."

1886
01:20:20,473 --> 01:20:21,474
I did, yeah.
Give me everything.

1887
01:20:21,558 --> 01:20:22,684
Yeah, you went all in.

1888
01:20:22,767 --> 01:20:25,186
- Yeah.
- I was so proud of you.

1889
01:20:27,188 --> 01:20:29,190
<i>No one else can really quite
understand</i>

1890
01:20:29,274 --> 01:20:31,484
<i>what we experienced;
it's a very unique thing.</i>

1891
01:20:31,568 --> 01:20:34,821
Think David Yates used
to describe us as astronauts

1892
01:20:34,904 --> 01:20:38,825
'cause no one else has really
experienced this in this scale.

1893
01:20:38,908 --> 01:20:41,578
And we'll be kind of
forever bonded by that.

1894
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:46,416
[horn honks]

1895
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:47,917
<i>Some of
the sweetest memories I have</i>

1896
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:49,544
from the three of us
is just each of us

1897
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:52,046
knowing we sort of needed
to take care of each other

1898
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,548
in just small ways.

1899
01:20:53,631 --> 01:20:55,467
<i>Just in terms of, like,
it's really cold.</i>

1900
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,803
Like we're all gonna...
we're all gonna stand together

1901
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,430
or I'm knackered.

1902
01:21:00,513 --> 01:21:03,391
Are you okay, Dan,
if I, like, fall asleep on you,

1903
01:21:03,475 --> 01:21:07,145
like, in between this take,
'cause I'm so tired or...

1904
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:09,481
I think we have all
fallen asleep in various

1905
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:10,899
like on... on each other

1906
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:12,817
in, like, some of
the most grand cathedrals

1907
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,570
and things in the UK.
[laughter]

1908
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:17,322
<i>The level of trust I had</i>

1909
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,492
and that we did build
over those 10 years was like,

1910
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,160
if we were doing a stunt,

1911
01:21:22,243 --> 01:21:24,996
<i>I trusted that
one of you would catch me.</i>

1912
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:26,790
<i>I feel like that kind of
trust and reliance</i>

1913
01:21:26,873 --> 01:21:28,917
and that takes, you know,

1914
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,502
there's very few
work environments

1915
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,003
where you get that much time
to build that up.

1916
01:21:32,086 --> 01:21:33,755
And it was like nonverbal.
Like it was,

1917
01:21:33,838 --> 01:21:35,590
it was like the three of us
could communicate

1918
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:37,884
without even having
to say anything.

1919
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:39,844
We just knew
what needed to be done.

1920
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:43,264
We were each very strong
for each other.

1921
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:46,100
Need to change.

1922
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,691
How, Hermione?

1923
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,735
Undetectable extension charm.

1924
01:21:57,028 --> 01:21:58,404
You're amazing, you are.

1925
01:21:59,489 --> 01:22:01,449
Always the tone of surprise.

1926
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,993
<i>These films had
a very different feel.</i>

1927
01:22:04,077 --> 01:22:05,578
<i>We were away from Hogwarts.</i>

1928
01:22:05,662 --> 01:22:08,748
A lot of the time
camping out different places.

1929
01:22:08,832 --> 01:22:10,500
<i>The tone was a lot darker.</i>

1930
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:12,210
<i>It felt like a different film.</i>

1931
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:14,295
Dumbledore sends you off
to find all these Horcruxes,

1932
01:22:14,379 --> 01:22:16,047
but it doesn't tell you
how to destroy them?

1933
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,757
It's very refreshing,
I think,

1934
01:22:17,841 --> 01:22:21,261
'cause we all got to do
some a lot more serious stuff.

1935
01:22:21,344 --> 01:22:22,929
<i>And it was a real opportunity</i>

1936
01:22:23,012 --> 01:22:24,556
to go deeper with these
characters.

1937
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,432
Are you coming,
are you staying?

1938
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,398
I saw you two the other night.

1939
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,025
Ron, that's... that's nothing.

1940
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:39,320
Ron...

1941
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:42,073
<i>The scene that I thought
was gonna be really awkward</i>

1942
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:43,908
<i>and I wasn't sure about at all</i>

1943
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,910
which was us doing our dance.

1944
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,079
- Yeah.
- Like I... now that's one

1945
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:51,499
of my favorite scenes
from the whole of the series,

1946
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:54,085
<i>because the level
of familiarity that you and I</i>

1947
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,087
<i>had with each other,
at that point, I didn't think</i>

1948
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,131
<i>I could have done a scene
like that with another actor.</i>

1949
01:22:58,214 --> 01:22:59,841
Well, it's also an
interesting scene 'cause like,

1950
01:22:59,924 --> 01:23:01,718
first of all, we were doing
Harry Potter films.

1951
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:03,636
And then on the last movie,
the director came and was like,

1952
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,763
"Hey, how about you do
slow dancing to Nick Cave

1953
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:07,265
for five minutes?"

1954
01:23:07,348 --> 01:23:08,600
We're like, "Wait,
what movie are we working on?"

1955
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,143
Like, "Great, but okay."

1956

01:23:35,752 --> 01:23:37,462
<i>It was unspoken. I loved that.</i>

1965
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,797
<i>And also in the same way
that for the characters,</i>

1966
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,507
<i>they got to have

<i>I feel like you and I got

1968
01:23:43,092 --> 01:23:44,469
- Yeah, certainly.
- Which we also...

1969
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:45,970
both: Needed at that point.

1970
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,805
- You know?
- Yes, absolutely.

1971
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:50,934
Treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1972
01:23:51,017 --> 01:23:52,810
<i>There was that, like... that
scene on the last movie</i>

1973
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,646
where it was like us
running through the forest.

1974
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,147
<i>We were racing through
the woods</i>

1975
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,107
trying not to be caught
by the Snatchers.

1976
01:23:58,191 --> 01:23:59,525
And action.

1977
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:03,655
Well, don't hang about.
Snatch him.

1978
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:05,990
<i>Honestly, I remember
you and I, Emma,</i>

1979
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:07,283
<i>becoming
incredibly competitive...</i>

1980
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:08,576
<i>Ridiculously competitive.</i>

1981
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,870
About who was
gonna run faster.

1982
01:24:10,954 --> 01:24:12,664
Give me five. That rocked!
Whoo-hoo!

1983
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:14,415
<i>I feel like
Rupert was always, like,</i>

1984
01:24:14,499 --> 01:24:16,000
<i>a little bit, too, like,
"You guys do what you like."</i>

1985
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,002
He was just like,
"You do your thing."

1986
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,254
- Yeah...
- I be here.

1987
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:21,339
For me, running is a stunt,

1988
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:23,007
walking is a stunt.

1989
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:27,345
Oof.

1990
01:24:29,263 --> 01:24:30,848
I absolutely do not like

1991
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:32,642
watching very many scenes
of myself in that,

1992
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:34,435
but I've watched you two
and I think you're brilliant.

1993
01:24:34,519 --> 01:24:36,354
I remember that was a really
sweet thing, though.

1994
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:38,773
I do actually remember that the
three of us telling each other

1995
01:24:38,856 --> 01:24:40,984
that we were doing a good job
or that we'd done a scene well.

1996
01:24:41,067 --> 01:24:43,069
Especially 'cause we had
started off young

1997
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:44,570
and really not knowing
what we were doing.

1998
01:24:44,654 --> 01:24:46,197
So that when we'd see
each other do
