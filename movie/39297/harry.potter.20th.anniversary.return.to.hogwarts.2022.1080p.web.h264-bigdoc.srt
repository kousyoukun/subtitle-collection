45
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,825
一切是怎麼開始的？
我從沒有機會問這個
How did it come to you?
Like, I never... I would never guess

to ask this question, how did you
end up doing Harry Potter?

47

48
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,414
說服我讀那些書
convinced me to read the books
after I refused three times.

- I said... I said

"Okay, I'll read these finally."

And then immediately,
I saw the movies.

00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:19,552
這是前所未有的狀況
I just saw them,
And that hasn't happened since.

55

Then I had to fly to Edinburgh
to meet Jo Rowling.

56

「這是我的願景」
And essentially said,
"This is my vision."

57
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,519
她說「這正是我看電影的方式」
She said, "That's exactly
the way I see the movie."

63

to fall in love

with J.K. Rowling's writing.

65
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:47,204
我那時大概八歲
I think I probably would've been
about eight years old.

66
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,665
{\an5}那是第一集出來的時候
I think that's when the first one
came out.

67
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,834
就像融入了我們的家庭一樣
It became like our family thing.

68
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,544
我爸爸模仿過所有的聲音
My dad used to do all the voices

69
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:56,380
我和我弟變得痴迷
and my brother and I
just became obsessed.

70
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:58,591
我們求他繼續唸
We would just beg him to keep going.

71
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:02,678
每當他唸一章，我們都會說
「再來一章，拜託？」
And every time he'd finish a chapter,
we'd be like

72
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,219
"One more! One more!
Please, just one more.

73
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,096
「再一章」
Please, please, please.
One more, one more, one more."

74
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,266
我在學校的一個朋友
有前兩集的書
A friend of mine at school had
the first two.

75
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,934
我去他家過夜
I went for a sleepover at his house.

76
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,562
{\an5}他說「神祕的魔法石」在書架上
He said, "Well, Philosopher's Stone's
there on the bookshelf."

77
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:14,064
我們開始徹夜讀書
That's what we did
this whole sleepover.

78
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:16,692
我們靜靜地坐在那裡
他在讀「消失的密室」
We just both sat there in silence,
him reading Chamber of Secrets

79
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,360
我在讀「神祕的魔法石」
me reading Philosopher's Stone.

80
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,945
我讀到無法自拔
And that was it, really.
I never looked back.

81
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,282
{\an5}我在閱讀的過程
瞬間和弗雷德和喬治產生共鳴
At the time of reading

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,157
we instantly related
to Fred and George

83
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,159
{\an5}因為文學作品中沒有多少雙胞胎
because there aren't many twins
in literature.

84
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:29,955
{\an5}「消失的密室」
是我第一本熬夜在看的書
The Chamber of Secrets
was the first book

85
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:29,914
that I sort of genuinely stayed up
at night reading.

86
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,707
文筆真生動
The writing was so vivid.

87
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,084
人物關係如此融洽
The characters so relatable.

88
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:37,213
{\an5}這是一個如此錯綜複雜的
It was such an intricately,
perfectly designed universe.

89
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,256
完美設計的宇宙

90
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,841
我覺得當時很容易忘記
I think it's very easy to forget
that at the time

91
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:43,385
{\an5}人們都在談論閱讀是無趣的
people were talking about, like,
the death of reading.

92
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,597
{\an5}我只是覺得這是美妙的人生觀
I just think it's a beautiful,
creative outlook on life

93
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,474
這種對無限可能的信念
this belief
in limitless possibilities.

94
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,185
我非常欣賞
ＪＫ羅琳的眾多原因之一
One of the many reasons I admire
J.K. so much

95
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,562
是數百萬人正在讀書
is that millions would now read books

96
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,940
或許他們這輩子
都不會拿起一本書
who would never have lifted
a book up in their lives.

97
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,943
而你突然意識到寫作的力量
And you suddenly realize
the power of writing.

98
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,319
哈利
Hip, hip, Harry!

99
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:03,447
然後在選角方面，這是…
And then in terms of casting

100
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,826
it was the search for Harry Potter,
it was insane.

101
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,826
尋找哈利波特的過程很瘋狂

102
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,453
新的「哈利波特」電影
正在尋找孩子
The new Harry Potter film are
looking for children

103
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:13,541
在這部價值數百萬鎊的電影中
飾演三個主要角色
to play the three main roles
in the multi-million pound film.

104
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,545
我記得第一次去試鏡
I remember going
to the... the very first audition

105
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:21,090
有數百甚至數千人
and there were hundreds,
if not thousands of people.

106
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,425
然後我們意識到
我們是那裡唯一的一對
And then we realized that we were
the only set of twins there

107
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,052
沒有穿相同衣服的雙胞胎
who weren't wearing
identical clothing

108
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:27,137
所以我們越過馬路
so we ended up going over the road

109
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:30,474
買了兩件相同的上衣
and bought two identical,
matching tops.

110
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:31,892
－直接穿上
－直接穿上
- Just off the rack.
- Just off the rack.

111
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:33,686
拿了就走
They're like, "Right, they will do."
And then off we went.

112
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,021
他們讓所有人集合
They'd let us all mill, you know,
sort of congregate.

113
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,356
聚集在一起

114
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,733
{\an5}所以他們似乎走開了
So they seemingly walked away.

115
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:43,904
{\an5}還有一個男生拿著麥克風
舉在我們的頭上
And of course,
while there's still one gentleman

116
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:43,821
holding a boom mic
straight over our heads.

117
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:46,991
有個小女孩問我「那是什麼？」
And this little girl asks me,
"What's that?"

118
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,578
我說「看就知道是麥克風啊」
I think I even said,
"It's a mic. Duh."

119
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:53,873
「他們正在拍攝
是在測試我們」
And I was like, "They're filming us.
This is just like a trick."

120
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,749
「我以前也有參與過」
Like, as if I've done it before,
really.

121
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,376
我記得，因為問的人就是艾瑪
I remember it because it was Emma.

122
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:02,339
我徹底被這次試鏡的
興奮氛圍所吸引
I became completely gripped

123
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:02,298
by the excitement
around this audition.

124
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:05,718
我的目標就是拿下妙麗的角色
I always knew
that I was going for Hermione

125
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,263
我的堅持讓我父母很擔心
他們想說…
in a way, that I think,
terrified my parents

126
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,263
because they were like

127
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,932
「如果她沒有得到這個角色
我們該怎麼辦？」
"What are we gonna do with her
if she doesn't get the part?"

128
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,058
我很興奮
I was just excited.
I wasn't sort of daunted.

129
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:15,477
我並沒有被嚇倒，沒思考太多

130
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,937
I wasn't thinking, "I wonder
how many films they're gonna make."

131
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,771
我想知道他們要拍多少部電影

132
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,106
我想「這會很有趣」
Anything like that.
I thought, oh, this will be fun.

133
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:21,025
{\an5}我覺得一開始最大的壓力
And I think the biggest pressure
at the beginning was

134
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,359
{\an5}是誰將成為哈利波特
who was gonna be Harry Potter.

135
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,779
我們找不到哈利
We couldn't find Harry.

136
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:25,988
We couldn't.
We just couldn't find Harry.

137
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:28,991
情況變得有點奇怪
大家也開始緊張起來
And it was getting kind of weird
and panicky.

138
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:32,912
有一天晚上
我在倫敦的酒店房間裡
I was in my hotel room
in London one night

139
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,039
觀看電台的「大衛高帕菲」
watching the BBC version
of David Copperfield.

140
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,999
我突然靈光一閃
Immediately, a light bulb went off
in my head and I said

141
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:38,751
「這就是哈利波特」
"This is Harry Potter.

142
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,545
「這就是我們幾個月來
一直在尋找的孩子」
This is the kid we've been
looking for, for months."

143
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,422
所以我問了選角導演，我說…
So I asked the casting director
and I said

144
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,507
「我們必須讓他來這裡試鏡」
"We've got to get him in here
for an audition."

145
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,842
她說「這根本不可能」
She said, "It's never gonna happen.

146
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,095
「他父母不想讓他捲入演藝圈」
His parents do not want him
involved in this world.

147
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,597
「他們不希望他飾演這個角色」
They don't want him
to take this role."

148
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,141
合約是簽所有七部電影
I think the deal was
to sign on for all seven films

149
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,726
他們將在洛杉磯拍攝
and they would be filmed in LA,
so Mom and Dad were like

150
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,854
爸媽認為「這對他的生活來說
是一個巨大的干擾」
"No, that's like a huge disruption
to his life."

151
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:04,026
幸運的是
幾週後大衛海曼去了劇院
Fortunately, David Hayman went
to the theater a few weeks later.

152
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,071
排在我前面的這兩個傢伙轉身
These two guys in the row
in front of me

153
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,029
started sort of turning round.

154
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:09,490
大衛是偉大的製作人
David being the great producer
that he is

155
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:14,453
說服丹的父親帶丹參加試鏡
convinced Dan's father
to bring Dan in for an audition.

156
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:17,164
And that's basically
when we got our Harry Potter.

157
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:17,206
基本上就是
我們選定哈利波特的時候

158
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:18,666
開拍
And action.

159
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,793
－那是龍蛋
－這是什麼？
That's a dragon egg.

160
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,419
－就是這樣
－那是什麼？
- What is it? I...
- That's what that is.
- What is that?
- A dragon egg.

161
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:23,837
一顆龍蛋

162
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:25,130
是的

163
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,256
我是一個快樂的孩子
I was a very happy kid

164
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,133
顯然有一種神經質的氣場
who had a really haunted quality,
apparently.

165
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,301
很可愛
"You're really sweet

166
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:33,013
但看起來像是經歷過很多事
but you look like
you have real, like, stuff going on."

167
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:37,309
我們當下情緒很激動
看到這個孩子坐在那裡說話
It was very emotional, actually

168
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,393
seeing this kid sitting there,
talking.

169
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:38,686
我想「是的，就是他」
And I just thought, yup, that's him.
Thank God we found him.

170
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,062
「感謝上帝，我們找到了他」

171
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:43,232
魯伯特和艾瑪很快就被選上了
Rupert and Emma
were very easy to cast

172
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,317
因為他們比預想的好
because they felt like
they jumped off the page.

173
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,152
我們一起試鏡了他們三個
We screen tested
the three of them together

174
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,071
為了確保他們
都有跟彼此產生化學反應
to make sure
that they all had this chemistry

175
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,782
這在第一次試鏡中就很明顯了
which immediately was obvious
in the first screen test.

176
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,411
記住，當她發現訊息時靠近她
Remember guys, get closer to her
as she finds out the information.

177
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,704
開拍
And action.

178
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:00,040
我從沒想過要仔細看看
I never thought to look in here.

179
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,877
我看過了
這在第一學期還算輕鬆的
I checked this out last term
for a bit of light reading.

180
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,255
－這算輕鬆？
－住口
- This is light?
- Shut up.

181
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,425
如果飛七現在就在轉角處
If Filch comes round the corner
any second now

182
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,927
至少會扣葛來分多五十分
at least 50 points off Gryffindor.

183
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,641
我就知道找到了
I knew it! Here it is.

184
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:23,480
尼樂勒梅先生是
唯一已知的魔法石製造者
Nicolas Flamel is
the only known maker

185
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,647
of The Sorcerer's Stone.

186
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:24,940
什麼？
- The what?
- The what?

187
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,609
你們兩個不讀書嗎？
Oh, honestly, don't you two read?

188
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,111
停，做得好
Cut. Good job.

189
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,989
很高興見到你
It's lovely seeing you.

190
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:33,699
這太不可思議了，對吧？
Yeah, this is surreal, isn't it?

191
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,869
{\an5}談論過去的感覺如何？
How do we all feel being back
and talking about this?

192
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:40,039
首先，我真的很激動
Well, A, really emotional obviously.

193
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:43,250
其次，感覺時間沒有過去
And B, it feels like
no time has passed

194
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,003
但時間已經過去很久了
and loads of time
has passed simultaneously.

195
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,838
我懂，這非常不可思議
Yeah, kind of much the same.
It's quite surreal.

196
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,174
感覺才過沒多久
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

197
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,801
感覺我們還沒有重新團聚
It doesn't feel like we've
kind of earned a reunion yet.

198
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,011
－是的
－我知道
- Yeah.
- I know. I know.

199
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:56,346
我患有腎結石的同時
還有個孩子
I have had kidney stones and a baby.
Some time has obviously passed.

200
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,307
－時間的確過很久了
－的確
- You did mention that.
- I feel my age.

201
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,683
我感覺老了

202
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,102
－但是有，比如…
－是的
But there is such a collection
of shared memories and stuff

203
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:05,773
回憶，例如我們共享的回憶

204
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,775
that we just all did together
that is immediately very easy to be

205
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:07,775
這很容易成為，就像…

206
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:09,443
有點回到從前的那個時候
to sort of slip back
into where you were.

207
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:12,071
我們的第一次試鏡
我們見面的那天
Our first audition,
the day we all met...

208
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,947
－我第一次…
－天啊，是的
- Oh my God, yeah.
- I think for the first time

209
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,824
我走出我的更衣室
there was, like, me walking out
of my dressing room

210
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,578
看到另一個棕髮男孩走向另一邊
and seeing another young,
brown-haired boy going the other way.

211
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:21,622
我從未見過他
但你顯然是另一個選角
I never saw his face but I was like,
"You're clearly another Harry

212
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,832
－今天正在試鏡
－是的
that is being tested out today."
And they were like

213
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,710
他們正在用
各種不同的配置測試我們
testing us with various
different configurations

214
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:27,878
榮恩、哈利和妙麗
of Ron, Harry and Hermione.
I remember there was one

215
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,131
我記得有一次
他們把我們放在一起

216
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,131
where they put
all the three of us together.

217
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,009
我記得那是我們三個人
I do remember
that when it was the three of us

218
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,261
－感覺不太一樣
－是的
- something felt different and...
- Right.

219
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,971
感覺一切都很合理
- Yeah.
- like, right and easy.

220
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,515
我還記得那瞬間
I do remember the click.

221
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:42,267
我們在工作室
他們說我們被選上了
We'd been at the studios.
They'd told us we got the parts.

222
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,604
他們說「我們正式宣布
你們被選上了」
And they're like, "Cool, so we're
announcing you got the parts.

223
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:48,148
「現在你們家外面
會有很多媒體」
There is now going to be
a lot of media outside your house

224
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,483
「所以你不能回家」
so you can't go home."

225
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:53,195
到目前為止，事情有點混亂了
So far, it's sort of turned things
upside down.

226
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,823
像…
It's...I don't know.

227
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:59,159
我不知道
我從來沒有遇過這樣的事情
I've never had anything happen
to me like this before.

228
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:02,079
妙麗和我很有共鳴
Hermione made complete sense to me.

229
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,499
那就是我，我就像是那個女孩
That's me. Like, I am that girl.

230
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:09,628
艾瑪可以說是片場裡最聰明的人
Well, Emma was arguably
the smartest person on the set.

231
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,839
我說的是整個片場，她…
And I'm talking about everybody.
She just was...

232
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,757
她是一個聰明的孩子
she was a brilliant kid.

233
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,968
我瘋狂喜歡我的角色
I think I'm scarily like
my character.

234
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,722
我住在一個七口之家
Because I live with a family of seven.

235
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,309
我有一個紅頭髮的妹妹
我住在洞穴屋裡
And I've got a red-headed sister,
and I live in a burrow.

236
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:28,147
魯伯特是個在鏡頭面前
非常淡定的１２歲男孩
Rupert is just the most camera-ready

237
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,481
12-year-old boy in the world
at that point.

238
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,606
在那個時候的世界

239
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,236
他無所畏懼
Like, he was so, like, just fearless.

240
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,072
魯伯特就是榮恩
Rupert was Ron, you know.

241
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,658
而丹有點像哈利
And Dan kind of was Harry.

242
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:41,952
成名是什麼感覺？
How do you feel
about becoming famous?

243
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:43,787
很酷
It'd be cool.

244
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,206
我們都在談論這個
We were all talking about this

245
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,042
你在我們的試鏡中
讓我們多麼自在
how comfortable you made us all
in our auditions

246
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,837
也影響了整個劇組
and how this extended massively
into the set.

247
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,673
我的記憶是
這對你來說似乎毫不費力
My memory of it is
that it seemed effortless to you.

248
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,801
在拍第一部電影的時候
我一直很戰戰兢兢
Well, on the first film,
I was dying the entire time.

249
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:01,597
但我相信不能帶來那種焦慮
But I just... I always believed

250
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:01,597
you cannot bring
that kind of anxiety.

251
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,056
我希望每個人都感到舒適
I want everyone to feel comfortable.

252
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,267
我希望每個人
都覺得這是個大家庭
I want everyone
to feel like it's a family.

253
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,102
我希望每個人
都有賓至如歸的感覺
I want everyone to feel
like they're home.

254
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,531
（霍格華茲的第一年）

255
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,501
聽我說，歡迎來到第一堂飛行課
Hey class, listen to me.
Welcome to your first finals.

256
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:34,129
我要你用手舉起掃帚
I want you to raise your hand
over the broom.

257
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,089
在拍攝電影的前幾週
For the first several weeks
on the film

258
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:39,801
孩子們基本上處於震驚狀態
the kids are basically in shock.

259
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,222
回想起來，我有點驚訝
我從來沒搞清楚狀況
Looking back,
I am sort of amazed at the fact

260
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,598
that I wasn't ever, like,
completely overwhelmed by it.

261
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,057
完全不知所措

262
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,894
丹，這次你轉身離開她時
轉身離開
- It's two pounds.
- Dan, when you turn away

263
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:50,437
from her this time you turn away,
grab onto this

264
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,938
抓住這個，你抬頭看

265
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:52,689
就像你會抓到它，好嗎？
look up like you're going to get it,
okay?

266
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:55,692
但我也認為那是
克里斯和整個劇組的安排
But I also think
that was again part of Chris

267
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:55,692
and the whole crew just like

268
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,736
讓我們一直玩得很開心
they kept us having fun
the whole time.

269
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,029
很明顯，我們只是孩子
Obviously, we were just kids
and we were all looking forward

270
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,907
我們都期待著一起胡鬧

271
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:01,907
to mucking about together.

272
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,619
克里斯哥倫布
把氣氛搞得非常像在一個遊樂園
Chris Columbus made the atmosphere
very much like a fun fair.

273
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:09,039
我們就像在片場上
無憂無慮的孩子
We were very much just like kids
being kids on a set.

274
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:12,125
我從一開始的記憶
My residing memory from the first...
from Philosopher's Stone is

275
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,878
從「神祕的魔法石」開始
我剛學會玩拍手遊戲
I just learned how to play Slam.

276
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:16,463
我們做了很多事情
You know what we did
a lot of as well?

277
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:17,798
－那個遊戲是…
－我的天啊
- Was that game. Slaps.
- Oh my God.

278
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,675
－拍手，是的
－打了這麼多手
- So much hand slap.
- Oh, slaps.

279
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,762
我們所有人的手都紅了
紅通通的手
With, like, all of us, like, red.

280
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,220
- Like, red raw hands from like...
- Yeah. I think we also upgraded...

281
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,348
－互相打得很厲害
－還有小腿
- hitting each other really hard.
- to knuckles as well and we're like

282
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,807
- Oh, and shins.
- Yeah.

283
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,557
－是的
－對
- Yeah.
- I remember shin version.

284
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:28,809
我記得小腿的版本

285
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,102
是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,521
對不起
- Sorry.
- Making me mad.

287
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,566
我是冠軍
I am the champion.

288
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,236
他們可能讓自己的工作更難了
They probably made their jobs harder
for themselves

289
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:40,821
讓我們盡可能地享受樂趣
by letting us have as much fun
as we had

290
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:44,616
因為讓我們從工作中
分散了注意力
because it distracted us from,
you know

291
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,825
the work we were supposed
to be doing.

292
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,119
各位觀眾，我有一個捕鼠器
And you, get a mouse trap...

293
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,954
－看影片就知道
－不要放在你的鼻子上
Oh, darling, don't put it
on your nose.

294
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,706
否則你會弄掉所有的妝
Going to remove all your makeup.

295
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,043
一個大問題是
在整個拍攝過程中
Like a big problem was, like,
throughout a take

296
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,795
our attention would, like,
would wane and come and go.

297
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,878
我們的注意力會來來去去

298
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,381
他們會說一句台詞
然後對著鏡頭微笑
They'd say a line
and then they'd smile at the camera

299
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,758
他們很高興能出演
「哈利波特」電影
or they were just so happy
to be in a Harry Potter film

300
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,177
無法長時間抑制他們的興奮
that they couldn't contain
their excitement long enough

301
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:06,096
專注於整個片場
to focus on an entire scene.

302
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,931
大夥們
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

303
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,851
哥倫布很常和孩子們一起工作
Columbus had worked with kids a lot.

304
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:13,353
他對他們非常好，真的很好
He was terrific with them,
he really was.

305
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:15,856
他常常跪下跟他們說話
He used to go down
on his knees to talk to them

306
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:17,774
擠成一團，沒人能聽到
and huddle around
so nobody could hear.

307
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:21,570
他就像父親一樣
你真的可以感覺到
He was such a dad as well.

308
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,655
Like, you could really feel that
we were kind of part of his family.

309
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,655
就像我們是他家庭的一部分

310
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:25,407
放鬆一點
Be a little looser with this.

311
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,117
然後就隨便聊了
- Don't just be talking.
- All right, reset to one.

312
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,368
－好的
－你知道我在說什麼嗎？
You know what I'm saying?
Walk and you're like frozen like this

313
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:29,953
－是的
－你就像這樣凍住

314
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:31,288
－但你可以…
－不
but you can be...

315
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,581
你真的覺得…
Do you really think...
of course he can use it.

316
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:35,208
你當然可以揮一下，好嗎？

317
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,500
- Okay?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,626
好的，不過做得好
Good job though.

319
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,920
這並不容易
因為這需要極大的耐心
But it's not easy because it takes
a tremendous amount of patience...

320
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,547
和孩子相處的時候
with kids, particularly with...

321
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,760
特別是和像我們一樣
好動又興奮的孩子

322
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,300
with kids as hyperactive

323
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:44,760
and as excited about it
as we all were.

324
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,179
（古靈閣巫師銀行）
Yes.

325
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:49,264
{\an5}－看起來很優雅
－他們想…
- Looking graceful and poised...
- Well, they wanted to read...

326
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,807
你們在這啊
Fancy seeing you boys here.

327
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:52,726
－你好
－來吧
Hey.

328
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,519
幾個葛來分多的傢伙
Snuck away. Couple of Gryffindor's
just kicking it.

329
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,229
－過來
－很高興見到你，兄弟
Look at you. Come here.
Good to see you, brother.

330
00:15:57,773 --> 00:16:00,901
克里斯哥倫布是如何保持
良好的精神狀態的？
How did Chris Columbus stay
in such good... good spirit?

331
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:02,986
我們跑來跑去的
但我們那時都是１１歲
We sort of ran around.
But I guess we were all, like, 11.

332
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,405
你可能會讓三個人做正確的事情
You might get, like, three people
to do the right thing.

333
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,074
但這並不意味著
你會在後台讓其他五位
But it doesn't mean you're gonna get
the other five in the background

334
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,200
－做正確的事
－不
- No. No.
- doing the right thing.

335
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,243
魯伯特很無情，一旦他開始…
And Rupert was relentless.

336
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,953
－一旦閘門打開
－天啊，是的
Once he started,
once the floodgate opened with him.

337
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,872
就是這樣才有用，不是嗎？
But just think that was...
That's why it worked wasn't it?

338
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,500
因為哥倫布基本上只是讓我們…
Because Columbus basically
just let us be...

339
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,709
－是啊，沒錯
－當孩子
- Yeah, true. True.
- kids.

340
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,378
我從不覺得我們是在工作
I never recalled feeling
like we're working.

341
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,046
這很重要，不是嗎？
But that's so important, is it?
That we had that.

342
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,173
這就是為什麼當你看電影時
會有這種感覺…
Yeah. That's why it feels
that way when you watch it.

343
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,925
－感覺就像一群孩子
－沒錯
- It feels like kids.
- Yeah. That's true.

344
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,718
我會告訴你，有趣的點是…
I tell you what's funny about that
though is being surrounded

345
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:32,474
被所有英國演藝圈的菁英包圍
by all the cream
of the British acting industry

346
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,766
and not having a clue who anyone is.

347
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,935
－對
－我以為理查哈里斯在那工作
I thought Richard Harris worked here
for... as a tour guide for a while.

348
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:37,896
做了一段時間的導遊

349
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:44,319
我不認為任何一個孩子有能力
I don't think any of the kids had
the capability of understanding

350
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,280
了解他們當時
正在打交道的人有多厲害
the gravity of who they were
dealing with at the time.

351
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,741
海格在村子裡
遇到的人不是陌生人
That was no stranger Hagrid met in
the village, it was Snape.

352
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:53,703
是石內卜教授
他知道如何瞞過毛毛

353
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:53,745
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

354
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,247
而且這時鄧不利多不在
- And with Dumbledore gone?
- Good afternoon.

355
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,456
午安

356
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,583
演藝圈的英國皇室
The British royalty
of the acting world.

357
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:00,877
你要對自己說什麼？
What have you got to say
for yourself?

358
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,587
我發誓我不知道是怎麼發生的
I swear, I don't know
how it happened.

359
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,799
當遇到我成長過程中
聽說過的演員
When I think of the people that I got
to just grow up around and hear

360
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:08,760
聽他們講話，跟他們互動
yeah, hear them interact
and hear the quickness of people.

361
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,804
並聽到他們的反應

362
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,432
大人演員進來了
The adult actors came in and were
like, the mischief in a funny way.

363
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,308
感覺很有趣，像在偷聽一樣

364
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,187
很棒
That's actually great.

365
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,689
比如，羅比寇特蘭
Like Robbie Coltrane.

366
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:23,900
他像個孩子，太不成熟了
He was such a kid, like, so immature
and, like, just so much fun.

367
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:27,237
而且太有趣了

368
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,449
他喜歡逗我們發笑
他真的很擅長
He loved making us laugh,
and he was incredibly good at it.

369
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,784
我幾乎嘗試了一遍
I've tried absolutely everything.

370
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:36,788
我試過面霜、我試過膠凍
我試過刮鬍子
I've tried creams,
I've tried jellies.

371
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:36,788
I tried shaving.

372
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:41,042
我醒來的每一刻
我丈夫都威脅要離開我
Every moment, I woke up it's like my
husband is threatening to leave me.

373
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,629
如果他真的愛我
我敢肯定他不會介意留一點鬍鬚
If he really loved me, he wouldn't
mind a little facial hair I'm sure.

374
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:47,215
但他非常難接受
But he's being very, very difficult.

375
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,385
{\an5}（不到黎明絕不停止
霍格華茲魔法與巫術學院）

376
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,680
{\an5}就像你的善良和溫暖
That, like, kindness
and that warmth from you...

377
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:55,182
使一切變得不同
it made all the difference.

378
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,601
我們在一起渡過了很多時光
Well, we spent so much time together.

379
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:00,312
我知道我和你在一起的時間
多過和我自己的孩子
- I know. I know.
- I mean...
I spent more time with you
than I did with my own children

380
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,230
我知道，很瘋狂
- at one point.
- I know. Wild.

381
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,523
我知道
- I know.
- I think most of my favorite scenes

382
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,650
我最喜歡的大多數場景，老實說

383
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:08,945
是與你和海格小屋裡的
那幫人在一起
if I'm honest, looking back, are with
you and the gang in Hagrid's hut.

384
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,990
當我被稱為麻瓜時
我一直在想那個場景
I keep thinking about that scene
where I get called a Mudblood.

385
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,701
－是的
－那天你對我真好
- Yes.
- And you were so sweet with me

386
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,661
－是的
－因為這就像我的第一次一樣
- that day.
- Yes.
Because it was, like, my first, like,
you know, big piece of acting.

387
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:18,371
大量的演技

388
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,336
他叫我麻瓜
He called me a Mudblood.

389
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:26,796
不會吧
He did not.

390
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,131
什麼是麻瓜？
What's a Mudblood?

391
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,300
意思是「髒血」
It means dirty blood.

392
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:33,178
對於一個麻瓜出身的人來說
麻瓜是個臭名昭彰的名字
Mudblood's a really foul name
for someone who is Muggle born

393
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:34,888
一個沒有巫師父母的人
someone with no magic parents,
someone like me.

394
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,515
跟我一樣的人

395
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,517
你們三個都成為如此出色的演員
The three of you have become
such great actors.

396
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,270
在那個片場
像是你進入了這個世界
Being on that set, you felt like
you actually entered the world.

397
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,773
有斯圖爾特克雷格
設計的所有場景
- Yeah. Yeah.
- With all of Stuart Craig sets-

398
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,441
他對細節的注意力很驚人
the attention to detail
was phenomenal.

399
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,446
（創造不可能）

400
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,367
我一直認為在霍格華茲
不應該感到…
I was always adamant that Hogwarts
shouldn't feel as if it's a world

401
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,912
彷彿這是一個現實中
不可能存在的世界

402
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,912
that couldn't exist in reality.

403
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,748
我有極大的創作自由
I had a tremendous amount
of creative freedom

404
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,543
我們可以從頭建造這個世界
so we could build this world
from the ground up.

405
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,337
電影裡的一些場景讓我不知所措
Some of the sets on Potter
were overwhelming to me

406
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,006
我演了３５年的戲，想說「天啊」
and I'd been doing it for 35 years
you know.

407
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,006
It's like, oh, blimey.

408
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,134
我第一次參觀片場時
The very first time
I visited the set

409
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,055
他們帶我穿過令人興奮的大廳
they walked me
through the Great Hall

410
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:17,013
which was mind-blowing.

411
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,725
所有的地板都是真正的約克石
All the floors are real York stone.

412
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,852
很多場景會出現２５０個人
A lot of those scenes
with 250 extras

413
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:24,729
不是在吃東西
就是到處晃來晃去
they're all about eating
and trampling around.

414
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,481
不能用塑膠餐盤
You're not gonna
put a plastic floor down.

415
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,191
必須是更符合那個背景的東西
It's gotta be the real stuff.

416
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,777
這些點燃的蠟燭
都在電線上下移動
And all these lit candles going up
and down in wires.

417
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,155
我最喜歡的片場之一
是所有漂浮蠟燭
One of my favorite moments
on set ever

418
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,114
was the moment
when all the floating candles

419
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,491
綁在天花板上的繩子開始燃燒
started burning through the ropes
that tied them to the ceiling

420
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,909
開始在餐廳周圍墜落
- and just started falling around
- Yeah.

421
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:39,786
數以百計的蠟燭
- the Great Hall.
- Hundreds of real candles

422
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,955
－真的很亮
－我的天啊
- Oh, man, yeah.
- that were really lit

423
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,666
在天花板上的釣魚線上
- on fishing line from the ceiling.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,501
現在很多都是靠後製
So much of that would be visual
effects now.

425
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,296
－但那時都是真的
－對，這太酷了
The fact that we got to actually be
- on that set, yeah.
- Actually, that's so true

426
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,089
－謝謝你，斯圖爾特
－是的
- It's so cool.
- Thank you, Stuart Craig.

427
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,966
－我們愛你，斯圖爾特克雷格
－是的
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We love you, Stuart Craig.

428
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:53,550
Yeah.

429
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:05,145
最難拍攝的場景是魁地奇比賽
The hardest scene to shoot
was Quidditch.

430
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,772
觀眾必須立即了解規則
And the audience had to understand
the rules immediately.

431
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:10,567
魁地奇比賽很容易理解
Quidditch is easy enough
to understand.

432
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,110
每支球隊有七名球員
Each team has seven players.

433
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,195
三名追球手，兩名擊球手
Three chasers, two beaters,
one keeper and the seeker.

434
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,947
一名守門員和一名找球手

435
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,157
那是你
That's you.

436
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,453
ＪＫ羅琳為我們做了
一本魁地奇比賽規則書
So Jo Rowling basically
did a rule book for us.

437
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:23,788
A Quidditch rule book,
explaining every detail of the game.

438
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,747
解釋遊戲的每一個細節

439
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,956
（魁地奇球場）

440
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,833
與我們的製作設計師
斯圖爾特克雷格一起
Then with Stuart Craig,
our production designer

441
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,044
設計了魁地奇球場的外觀
designed the look
of the Quidditch pitch

442
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:36,926
為一場完全不真實的比賽
打造了以假亂真的基調
and really create a pitch that felt
authentic and real for a game

443
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,968
that is completely unreal.

444
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:41,306
充滿活力和熱情，準備開始
Lots of energy and enthusiasm.

445
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,014
Set and action.

446
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:42,432
她進球了
She scores.

447
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:46,227
莉娜強生得分，葛來分多得十分
Angelina Dancer scores.

448
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,227
Ten points for Gryffindor.

449
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,647
我一直想告訴你這件事
但有那麼一刻
I always wanted to tell you this

450
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,315
but there was a moment on day two,
maybe or three

451
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,523
在第二天，或第三天

452
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:52,859
攝影機對著你，你說…
the camera pushes into you
and you say

453
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,611
「我不要回家，不是回真的家」
"Mm, we're not going home,
not really."

454
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:56,237
火車開走了
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

455
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,031
不是嗎？

456
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:01,284
我不要回家，不是回真的家
I'm not going home, not really.

457
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,454
想到這裡我還是會熱淚盈眶
I got tear, I still get tears
in my eyes thinking about it.

458
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:08,291
我心裡想「這個孩子
是個了不起的演員」
I thought, this guy,
this kid is an amazing actor.

459
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,627
－謝謝
－那一刻
- Oh, that's...
- And it was that moment

460
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,879
為我們打開了整個世界
that kind of opened up
the whole world for us.

461
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:15,840
第一部電影像童話故事
非常吸引人
And the first film
was very storybook.

462
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,925
- It's very inviting, it's like...
- Yes. It's lovely and...

463
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,967
－是的，很可愛
－歡迎來到霍格華茲

464
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:18,093
- welcome to Hogwarts.
- welcome to Hogwarts.

465
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,637
－直到你看到電影的結尾
－我融化了一個男人的臉
Yeah. Until you get
to the end of the movie.

466
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,721
- And I melt a man's face.
- Yes. Yeah, exactly, Yeah.

467
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,347
對，就是這樣

468
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,688
－第一部電影很受歡迎
－是的
- The first film was a hit.
- Yup.

469
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:33,274
變成爆紅電影後
人們不僅接受了這部電影
So once it became a hit

470
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,066
and people accepted
not only the film

471
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,818
－也接受了演員
－是的
- but accepted the cast...
- Right, yeah.

472
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,695
－我在第二部電影像吃了定心丸
－對
- I had a ball on the second film.
- Oh, cool.

473
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,072
「消失的密室」
因為我可以拍得更無拘無束
The Chamber of Secrets.
Because I was like, free.

474
00:21:54,671 --> 00:22:00,135
（衛斯理家庭價值觀）

475
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,931
來吧
Go, come on.

476
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:07,392
來吧
Okay, come on.

477
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:10,270
Shh, come on.

478
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,233
－早安，衛斯理一家
－早安，爸爸
Morning, Weasley's.

479
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:15,275
Morning, Dad.

480
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:19,487
我總是喜歡衛斯理一家
在一起的任何場景
I always loved any scene where the
kind of Weasley's were all together

481
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,697
就像洞穴屋的場景
like the burrow scenes.

482
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,616
{\an5}有股狂熱的能量
每個人都互相捉弄對方
It just had this frenetic energy.

483
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,783
Everyone kind of played off
each other.

484
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,868
{\an5}（衛斯理洞穴屋）

485
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:28,121
{\an5}我記得關於洞穴屋的事情
是它一直在改變
The thing about the burrows
I remember

486
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,996
is that it changed all the time.

487
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:30,165
{\an5}不斷膨脹和收縮
It sort of expanded and contracted.

488
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,334
一分鐘前有一個
鋪著磁磚的巨大的壁爐
One minute, there was a huge
fireplace with floor pattern.

489
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,212
然後它變小了
And then it was just...

490
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,337
- And then it got smaller.
- A little one.

491
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,965
就像一個活生生的呼吸裝置
不時會改變
Yeah, it was like a living,
breathing set. It changed.

492
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,801
我覺得飾演衛斯理一家
是「哈利波特」中最棒的部分
I feel like being a Weasley is the
best part of being in Harry Potter.

493
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:44,804
就像我們的霍格華茲一家
真的太特別了
We had, like, our Hogwarts family

494
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,056
but I felt, like, so special having
an actual extra family.

495
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:47,766
－有另外一個家庭
－太棒了

496
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,018
這是最棒的一件事
- It was great.
- And all these scenes that we got
- on top of everything else.
- Julie's brilliant to work with.

497
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:51,686
與茱莉共事非常棒

498
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,981
每當我們到達片場
到處會傳來「爸爸媽媽好」
We used to arrive on set,
"Hello, Mummy."

499
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:55,064
"Hello, Daddy."

500
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:57,609
飾演我母親
衛斯理夫人的茱莉沃特斯
Julie Walters, who played my mother,
Mrs. Weasley, was...

501
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,487
對我來說真是太棒了
Was just so wonderful
and brilliant to me.

502
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,363
她真的很照顧我
She really kind of took me under
her wing.

503
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,116
她擁有完美的媽媽形象
And she just was, like,
the perfect mother figure.

504
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,535
這對雙胞胎是我
非常親近的兩個人
The twins were two people
I was really close with.

505
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,996
他們真的像哥哥一樣
They really were like older brothers.

506
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,124
茱莉沃特斯和馬克威廉姆斯
他們就像我的第二個家庭
Julie Walters and Mark Williams,
they were like my second family.

507
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,001
他們總是很入戲
They were always kind of
staying in character

508
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:18,129
他們會互相試探
and they would have this kind of...

509
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,213
they would bounce off each other.

510
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,298
鄧不利多…
- Dumbledore... Dore...
- Who? Who, dear?

511
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:22,258
誰？親愛的？

512
00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,469
鄧不利多一定知道
你在這裡，哈利
Dumbledore must know
you're here, Harry.

513
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,805
停
Cut.

514
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:29,808
停，這樣不行
Stop, stop.

515
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,433
This isn't working.

516
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:32,811
不敢相信，你們看起來很棒
I can't believe it.

517
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:33,978
你好嗎？
- You guys look great.
- Hello, hello.
How are you? This is amazing.

518
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:35,688
太了不起了，你們最近還好嗎？
- How you guys doing?
- Very well, thank you.

519
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,440
－很好，謝謝你好嗎？
－好的
- Fantastic. How are you?
- Good.

520
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:40,068
太令人興奮了
自從阿茲卡班之後我第一次回來
- Yeah, mate. We're good.
- This is so exciting.
- Yeah.
- It's very exciting.

521
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,569
我們不知道你會回來
This is the first time
I've been back since Azkaban.
We didn't know you
were gonna come back.

522
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:48,451
衛斯理家族的價值觀
和藹、體貼和有趣
The Weasley family values.

523
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:48,827
What consideration,
thoughtfulness, and fun.

524
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,205
哈利，你一定對麻瓜瞭如指掌
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

525
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:56,125
橡皮鴨的作用究竟是什麼？
Tell me, what exactly is the function
of a rubber duck?

526
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:58,670
我們在一起的時候很自然
It's just very natural
when we were all together.

527
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:01,923
這是一個家庭
你知道的，除了名字之外
It was a family, you know.

528
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:01,548
In all but name.

529
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,634
這也是很酷的事情
就是你看到了那種情緒
The best, cool thing about it as well
is that you see

530
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,594
that motion where they are
very inclusive.

531
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,594
他們非常包容

532
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,889
你會看到馬份家完全相反的情況
And then you see the complete
opposite with the Malfoy's.

533
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,308
兩個家庭的比較總是很精彩
Yeah. It's always such a
good comparison, the two families.

534
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,227
完全不同
- Well, you've got like a...
- Side by side, yeah.
a real chalk and cheese side of it.

535
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:17,647
跩哥，要有禮貌
Now, now, Jacob, play nicely.

536
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:20,483
波特先生
Mr. Potter.

537
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,986
（認識馬份家）

538
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,529
我是魯休思馬份
Lucius Malfoy.

539
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,322
我們終於見面了
We meet at last.

540
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,740
{\an5}我第一次知道哈利波特
I was first aware of Harry Potter

541
00:24:27,824 --> 00:24:30,869
{\an5}因為無論我走到哪裡
每個人都在地鐵上看書
because everybody was reading the
books on the tube.

542
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,286
Everywhere I went.

543
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:34,622
我一開始不想演魯休思
但後來被說服了
I'm convinced I ended up playing
Lucius because I didn't want to.

544
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,666
我去參加吉德羅洛哈的試鏡
I went to audition
for Gildery Lockhart

545
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:38,084
克里斯說「太好了」
and Chris said, "That was great.

546
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,627
「你介意演看看
不同的角色嗎？」
Would you mind reading
a different part?"

547
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,171
我當時在「彼得潘」中
飾演胡克船長
I was about to play Captain Hook
in Peter Pan and I thought

548
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:44,507
我不想演兩個孩子的反派
well I don't want to play
two children's villains.

549
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:48,553
我咬牙切齒地讀著，我深感辛酸
And I read through gritted teeth.

550
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:48,553
I was deeply bitter.

551
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:51,139
當然，這正是必要的
And, of course,
that's exactly what was necessary

552
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:54,309
最後他們讓我演魯休思
感謝上帝他們這麼做
and they asked me to play Lucius.

553
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,267
And thank God they did.

554
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:56,477
你怎麼敢？
How dare you?

555
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,813
對我來說，他出現在故事中
The point of him
being in the story to me

556
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,691
是為了解釋為什麼馬份在學校
was to explain why Draco
was such a horrible, heartless

557
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:04,527
是一個如此可怕又無情
有虐待傾向的惡霸
sadistic bully at school.

558
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,655
一頭紅頭髮和穿著舊衣服
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?

559
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,782
你一定是衛斯理家的
You must be a Weasley.

560
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,492
是馬份父母的產物
He's a product of his parents, Draco.

561
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,413
他有非常糟糕的父母
And he's got really bad parents.

562
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,206
如果海格是第一個影響你的人
If Hagrid was your first influence,
chances are you're gonna be

563
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,502
你很有可能會成為可愛溫暖的人

564
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,417
"All right there, mate."

565
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,502
You're gonna be lovely very huggy.

566
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,254
是不是很漂亮？
Isn't he beautiful?

567
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,673
看，牠認識牠的媽媽
Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

568
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:34,724
如果你爸爸是一個揮舞著
眼鏡蛇手杖的神經病
If your dad is a psychopath wielding
a cobra cane out bout

569
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:37,435
你可能不會成為最友善的人
you're probably not gonna be
the friendliest either.

570
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,562
第３５幕，第７場，相機標記
Speed. 37th take, one eight,
camera mark.

571
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:42,565
湯姆，記住，放慢下來
- Tom, remember...
- And stay on slate.

572
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,485
Slow, telling a tale
but very sinister. Soft.

573
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,693
表現出邪惡又溫柔的一面

574
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,403
準備，開始
Set and action.

575
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,489
我從第一次見到湯姆就很喜歡他
I adored Tom
from the second I met him.

576
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:52,450
他永遠都那麼貼心
But he was always
just the biggest sweetheart.

577
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,953
與傑森一起工作真是一種享受
Working with Jason was a real treat.

578
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:58,957
事實上，與傑森一起工作
並不總是一種享受
In fact, working with Jason
was not always a treat.

579
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,463
他立刻變成我見過的
最不友善、最可怕的人
He just immediately turned
into the most unfriendly

580
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:05,380
horrible person I've ever met.

581
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,256
我只記得抓住他
I just remember grabbing him and,
and just being as unpleasant

582
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,260
盡我所能，不愉快地
看著他的小臉

583
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:11,260
as I possibly could
and watching his little face

584
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:13,096
不斷尋求我的認可
constantly seeking my approval.

585
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,974
我拍攝的第一個場景
實際上被剪掉了
The very first scene that I shot
was actually cut

586
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,392
這是在刪除的場景中
and it's on the deleted scenes.

587
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,518
馬份摸了某個東西
Draco touched something
and I used this cane and I went...

588
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:19,936
我手上有手杖，然後我…

589
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,314
不要碰任何東西，馬份
Don't touch anything, Draco.

590
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:25,400
但我不知道牙齒有多鋒利
But I didn't know
how sharp the teeth were

591
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,860
插到小湯姆的手
and they went right
into little Tom's hands.

592
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:30,905
他抬頭看著我，眼裡噙滿淚水
And he looked up at me
and his eyes welled with tears.

593
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,240
是的，父親
Yes, father.

594
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,700
我說「湯姆，我很抱歉」
And I went, "Tom, I'm so sorry.

595
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:36,202
我沒有意識到有多鋒利
I didn't realize how sharp they were
and how heavy it was."

596
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:38,913
他說「我知道，沒關係
很適合這一場戲」
And he went, "No, no, it's all right.
It was good for the scene."

597
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,498
他會是這個邪惡的父親
He'd be this evil father,
and then they say cut

598
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:42,417
當他們說「停」

599
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,586
他過來抱抱我說
「我打得太狠了嗎？」
and he'll come and give you a cuddle
and say

600
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,461
"Oh, did I, did I hit you too hard?
Did I hit you too hard?"

601
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,089
就像化身博士
He's a real, you know,
Jekyll and Hyde, that one.

602
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:52,719
Yeah.

603
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,928
Yeah.

604
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:56,556
Yeah.

605
00:26:56,723 --> 00:27:00,852
哈利波特，真是我的殊榮
Harry Potter, such an honor, it is.

606
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:04,272
我記得對一個朋友說
我有去配音
I remember saying to a friend,
you know, "I've got this part.

607
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:06,232
「哈利波特」裡的精靈
It's an elf in the Harry Potter."

608
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:12,238
歡樂的尖叫聲和徹底的絕望
And the squeals of joy
and the complete despair

609
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:14,073
我有多困惑
at my not understanding th...

610
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:16,868
這個角色有多重要
you know, how important
this character was.

611
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,874
我們拍攝時，他說「謝謝你」
We did a take, and he goes,
"Thank you, Lucius ."

612
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:24,500
下一秒我就踢倒他
And I swung my leg out
and I stepped down

613
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:26,919
我走下台階，揮舞著我的手杖
and I, and I swung my stick
and Chris goes, "Cut.

614
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:30,006
克里斯說「停，能把傑森
滑倒的地板打掃乾淨嗎？」
Can we clean the floor
where Jason slipped, please?"

615
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,591
我說「我沒有滑倒」
And I said, "No, I didn't slip."
He said, "Well, what happened?"

616
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:33,134
他說「怎麼了？」

617
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,553
我說「我把多比踢下樓梯」
And I said, "I kicked Dobby
down the stairs."

618
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,772
我覺得這會非常有趣
And I just thought, this is gonna be
ridiculously good fun.

619
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,942
馬份先生…
Mr. Malfoy?

620
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:50,234
Mr. Malfoy?

621
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:53,029
這裡有你的東西
I have something of yours.

622
00:27:55,114 --> 00:27:57,784
襪子很可悲，對吧？
在某一個層面上來說
The sock is pathetic, isn't it,
on one level

623
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,952
但在另一個層面上，這就是一切
but on another level,
it's everything.

624
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:03,206
我認為這就是
這個角色的美妙之處
And that's, I think,
the beauty of the character.

625
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:06,417
主人給了多比一隻襪子
Master has given Dobby a sock.

626
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,002
什麼？我沒給
What? I didn't g...

627
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:12,632
主人送給多比衣物
Master has presented
Dobby with clothes.

628
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:15,593
多比自由了
Dobby is free.

629
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:20,264
這部電影的主題之一
就是願意忍辱負重的朋友
One of the major themes is this
alliance of friends who endure.

630
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:37,615
那是我們最開心的一次
So you and I had one
of our greatest laughs together

631
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:39,242
－與理查哈里斯
－是的
- Yes.
- with Richard Harris.

632
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:43,454
我們有一個動畫版的鳳凰佛客使
And we had a animatronic version

633
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,412
- of the Fawkes the phoenix.
- Yeah.

634
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,748
一隻不存在的紅色大鳥
And it was this bird, a big,
red bird that doesn't exist in life.

635
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:46,999
牠不存在
- That does not exist.
- It's not...

636
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,669
也並非不是真的
的確可能是真的
It wasn't unrealistic,
and like, it could, I guess.

637
00:28:49,752 --> 00:28:53,965
理查進來看著鳳凰說
Richard came in
and looked at the phoenix

638
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:57,009
and said, "Wow, they train these
animals marvelously these days."

639
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:57,051
他們訓練這些動物真是太棒了

640
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,761
牠眼睛裡有一個攝影鏡頭
Because they had a camera
inside the eyes.

641
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:00,596
可以看到理查在看牠
So they could see Richard
looking at it.

642
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,517
然後他們就想說
「我們不想把話說破」
And then they were like,
"Well, we don't wanna break the spell

643
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,269
「我們就讓鳥兒
繼續做出反應和移動」
so we'll just keep the bird
reacting and moving."

644
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,354
之後就一直這樣下去了
And then that, of course,
you know, got into a cycle

645
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,356
理查還以為這隻鳥在回應他
where Richard was like,
"The bird is responding to me."

646
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:14,485
迷人的生物，鳳凰
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

647
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:17,905
牠們可以承載非常重的重量
They can carry immensely
heavy loads

648
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,492
牠們的眼淚有治癒的力量
through their, their tears
and healing powers.

649
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,494
－我們沒有告訴過他
－沒錯
- We never told him.
- No, we never told him.

650
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:24,871
他認為這是一隻真正的鳥
- No. Yeah.
- He just thought it was a real bird.

651
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,956
我們參與其中，真是太瘋狂了
It was insane
that we were part of that.

652
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,084
我不知道有誰可以像你這樣
開始拍這系列的電影
You know, I do not know
of another human being

653
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,084
that could've started the series
in the way you did.

654
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,504
這讓我感覺很棒
我一直對離開感到內疚
Well, that makes me feel great.

655
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:34,213
I have always felt guilty
about leaving, I really did.

656
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:34,672
但我還是離開了

657
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,008
當我和你們說再見時…
- Don't.
- When I said goodbye to you guys

658
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:39,510
I was like, I can't believe
I'm leaving these guys.

659
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:39,468
我不敢相信我要離開你們

660
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:44,182
我認為你得到的殊榮永遠不夠
And I think you honestly

661
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:42,054
I don't think you ever get
enough credit

662
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:45,850
for, like, what you achieved on
those first two and with all of us.

663
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,933
對前兩集和我們所有人來說都是

664
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,101
非常感謝你
And so thank you so much for that.

665
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,353
這是我一生中最偉大的經歷
It's been the greatest experience
of my life.

666
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,154
你沒有意識到
一個人的出身並不重要
You fail to recognize that it matters
not what someone is born...

667
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:01,699
而是他們成長成什麼樣子
but what they grow to be.

668
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:08,247
（第二章，成年）

669
00:30:08,331 --> 00:30:10,166
（哈利波特：阿茲卡班的逃犯）

670
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,792
（哈利波特：火盃的考驗）

671
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,127
你好
Hello.

672
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,253
（天狼星布萊克）

673
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:16,631
{\an5}（藥水教室
霍格華茲魔法學校）
- Oh, how are you?
- Oh, good. Oh, thank you for coming.

674
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,007
{\an5}你好嗎？

675
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,219
{\an5}謝謝你來，謝謝接受訪談

676
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,219
Thanks for chatting.

677
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:25,306
那是誰？那個人
Who is that, that man?

678
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,059
那是誰？
Who is that?

679
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,103
那是天狼星布萊克
That is Sirius Black, that is.

680
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:35,441
天狼星布萊克
是哈利不可或缺的角色
Sirius Black is an essential
character for Harry.

681
00:30:35,524 --> 00:30:38,569
{\an5}這是ＪＫ羅琳的主題
不要以貌取人
It's part of Jo's themes
of don't judge a book by its cover.

682
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,613
{\an5}天狼星布萊克作為罪犯的形象
You know, the image of Sirius Black
as a criminal

683
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,740
{\an5}是呈現給哈利的
is one that's presented to Harry.

684
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:44,617
我們有一個逍遙法外的殺手
We have a killer on the loose.

685
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,285
你是說天狼星布萊克？
Sirius Black, you mean?

686
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,788
他跟我有什麼關係？
But what's he got to do with me?

687
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:53,042
然而，當哈利遇到他
並在第三部電影的過程中
And yet, when Harry meets him

688
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:52,917
and through the course
of the third film

689
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:56,671
他開始了解到
他不是別人告訴他的那個人
he comes to learn that he's not
who he is being told he was.

690
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,589
他是一個非常不同的人
He's somebody very different.

691
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:01,467
蓋瑞是一位如此出色的演員
And Gary is such a remarkable actor.

692
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:06,180
我們選擇他的原因之一
是他有黑暗的潛質
One of the reasons we chose him

693
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,846
is he obviously has the potential
for darkness

694
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:11,769
但他同時有個溫暖的靈魂
but he has such soul
and has such a warmth within.

695
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:15,731
請問你是什麼時候
知道天狼星的？
Can I ask you when were
you first approached to be Sirius?

696
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:18,192
我知道「哈利波特」
I was aware of Harry Potter

697
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:21,028
but it was very much a sort of
kids thing.

698
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,112
這對我來說就是兒童讀物

699
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:24,156
人們告訴我要去看這系列的書
而且我有孩子
People were telling me
to read the books

700
00:31:22,905 --> 00:31:27,326
and I had kids, so it was gonna be
in my universe somewhere.

701
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,410
所以總是會在我人生中出現

702
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:31,289
然後他們採取了一種
稍微陰暗的方法
And then they would take in
a slightly darker approach

703
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,707
這本書很有趣
- and the book was interesting.
- Yeah.

704
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,166
我遇到了艾方索
I met Alfonso, and I think at the
time, he was my attraction.

705
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,836
我認為當時他是主要的吸引力

706
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,797
記住，你必須照顧好你的青蛙
Remember guys,
that you have to carry your frogs.

707
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,923
別擔心

708
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:44,510
在「阿茲卡班的逃犯」這一集
孩子們逐漸轉大人
For Azkaban, it's a coming of age.

709
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:50,182
他們正在跨越
童年和青少年時期之間的門檻
They are passing the threshold
between childhood

710
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,224
and their teenage years.

711
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:54,145
{\an5}在前兩集中，哈利還是個孩子
In the first two,
Harry is still a child.

712
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:59,859
整部電影的基調偏向樂觀
There is a greater optimism
around the tone itself.

713
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:02,945
然而，當他年滿１３歲時
Nevertheless, when he turns 13.

714
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:07,241
哈利周圍的一切
彷彿朦上了一層陰影
There is a big cloud that overshadows
everything around Harry.

715
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,953
我們還需要在風格上傳達這一點
And we needed to convey
that also stylistically.

716
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,213
這是怎麼回事？
What's going on?

717
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:24,467
我不知道，也許我們被襲擊了
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

718
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:36,896
「阿茲卡班的逃犯」
感覺就像一個全新的時代
Prisoner of Azkaban felt like
a whole new era, really.

719
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,067
{\an5}這是一個更黑暗的故事
It was a much darker kind of story.

720
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,861
{\an5}裡面有很多非常成人向的主題
There was a lot of kind of
quite adult themes in it.

721
00:32:43,944 --> 00:32:49,200
ＪＫ羅琳對催狂魔的描述非常可怕
The descriptions that J.K. Rowling
has of the dementors are very scary.

722
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,453
我真的很想傳達這種感覺
And I really wanted to convey
this sense that the dementors

723
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:57,625
催狂魔所做的
就是把所有的快樂都吸走

724
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:57,583
what they do is,
they suck all the joy away.

725
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:02,046
他們正在吸取哈利的精華
That they were sucking
an essence of Harry.

726
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,132
但我認為要實現這一目標
But I think that the most
important piece to achieve

727
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,885
最重要的部分是丹的表現
that was Dan's performance.

728
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,723
拍攝「阿茲卡班的逃犯」時
你幾歲？
When was Azkaban...
How old were you?

729
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,392
１４
14.

730
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,352
－我們第一次見面的時候？
－是的
- Really? When we first met?
- Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:33:16,435 --> 00:33:20,356
我有一種天生的父愛
I think I had a natural sort of
paternal thing.

732
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:28,864
你要殺了我嗎，哈利？
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

733
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,243
第一個一進來片場
就讓我敬畏三分的人
The first person I remember being,
like, I awe of when they came in

734
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,036
－是蓋瑞歐德曼
－我記得
- was Gary, was Gary Oldman.
- I remember that.

735
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,956
－你記得我嚇壞了嗎？
－我記得你說跟蓋瑞聊天的事
- Because that was...
- I remember you giving me the...

736
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,039
- Yeah, yeah, me freaking out? Right.
- the, the Gary chat. Yeah.

737
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,500
你說「聽著，艾瑪
你需要保持冷靜」
You were like, "Listen, Emma,
you need to be cool

738
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,961
「因為蓋瑞歐德曼
他真的是個大人物」
because Gary Oldman
is a really big deal

739
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:43,295
「你需要保持冷靜」
and you need to be cool."

740
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:44,630
我說「好吧」
- And I was like, okay.
- I mean...

741
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:47,383
這真的是我自己恐懼的投射
And which, and which was really
a projection of my own fears

742
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,427
因為我當時想
「丹，你需要保持冷靜」
because I was like,
"Dan, you need to be cool.

743
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,803
「這傢伙是個大人物」
This guy's a big deal."

744
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,224
丹起初有點害怕
Dan was first a bit daunted

745
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:57,518
蓋瑞非常慷慨
and Gary was amazingly generous
as a person but also as an actor.

746
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,353
作為一個人，也作為一個演員

747
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:04,400
立即接受了他
將他納入了演技指導訓練
And he immediately embrace him

748
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,066
and include him in...
in the acting process.

749
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:07,695
看到他們兩個真的很溫馨
It was really sweet
to see the two of them

750
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,199
這幾乎就像是反映了這種關係
and it was almost as if
it was mirroring that relationship

751
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:17,204
因為在很多方面來說
哈利都把天狼星當成崇拜對象
because in many ways
Harry has made a totem out
of Sirius Black

752
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,207
那個崇拜對象有點難以接近
that taught him
that he's kind of unapproachable

753
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,710
而且在很多方面都很可怕
and in many ways, scary.

754
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,920
這和電影裡沒什麼不同
And then that was not unlike
in the film

755
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:27,423
當他們發現真正的自己時
that when they discover
who they truly are

756
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,009
彼此之間有不可思議的羈絆
is when suddenly there
is an amazing bond.

757
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:32,261
你在拍攝時看到他們
And you saw them between takes
sitting with each other

758
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:35,181
坐在一起，有說有笑

759
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,055
talking and laughing

760
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:41,937
可以從丹看著蓋瑞的方式
看出他有多敬愛他
and you could see in the way
that Dan looked at Gary

761
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,645
the adulation and the respect
that he had for him.

762
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:43,355
最後尖叫小屋裡的那一幕
All the stuff in the Shrieking Shack
at the end, I feel like me

763
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:45,774
感覺就像我、魯伯特和艾瑪
在看一場廝殺大戰
Rupert and Emma were just like
watching tennis in that scene

764
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:47,860
我說「這就是演技」
just being like,
"This is acting, guys

765
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:50,029
「這是我們所有人
都需要努力的方向」
this is what we all need
to working towards."

766
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,239
有蒂莫西斯波
There was Tim Spall

767
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,742
－唯一的艾倫里克曼
－是的
- the one and only, Alan Rickman.
- Yeah.

768
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:58,245
大衛休里斯、你、艾瑪、魯伯特
David Thewlis.

769
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,037
You, Emma, Rupert.

770
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,539
把我、艾瑪和魯伯特
分配在那個組中真是太好了
It's really nice of you
to include me

771
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,706
Emma and Rupert in that group.

772
00:35:00,623 --> 00:35:04,376
看著你們演戲
也只是看著你們作為人
To watch you guys act but also
just watching you guys as people

773
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,504
看著這些不可思議的演員
and just watching these, like,
incredible actors who were just like

774
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,714
你們只是普通人
"Oh, yeah, no, you're just people."

775
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:10,216
你會在兩者之間平衡得很好
And you'd have fun in between

776
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:12,510
整個過程完全不會痛苦
雖然可能不容易
and the whole process
doesn't have to be painful.

777
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:14,762
你有時也向我展示了神奇之處
It can be intense
- and you showed me the wonders
- Yeah.

778
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,305
這真的很重要
of that sometimes as well,
and that was really important.

779
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:17,515
－我們快殺了他
－等等
- Let's kill him.
- Wait.

780
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,433
我等過了
I did my waiting, 12 years of it

781
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,977
等了１２年

782
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:24,647
在阿茲卡班
in Azkaban.

783
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:28,943
在我的一生中，我從未拍過
有如此出色演員陣容的場景
I have never done a scene
with such an amazing cast in my life.

784
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,694
這是一顆很長的鏡頭
It's a very long scene

785
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:33,656
有很多曲折的鏡頭
it's the scene in which there
are a lot of twists inside the scene

786
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,407
真是太有趣了
and it was so much fun.

787
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:36,784
這是一個激烈的場景
It's an intense scene in
which a lot of things are at stake.

788
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,744
其中很多事情都處於危險之中

789
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,747
不，我原本還很信任你
No! I trusted you!

790
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,209
你可以看到魯伯特、艾瑪和丹
And you can see Rupert, and Emma,
and Dan

791
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,128
他們非常投入
that they are completely
committed to this scene.

792
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,632
我好喜歡
我對這場戲有美好的回憶
I love it.
I, I have such a great memory of it.

793
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,885
我告訴鄧不利多
你在幫助老朋友進城堡
I told Dumbledore you were helping
an old friend into the castle

794
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,012
現在，這就是證據
and now here's the proof.

795
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,222
真厲害，石內卜
Brilliant, Snape.

796
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:02,851
再次利用敏銳和精明的腦袋
得出錯誤的結論
Once again, you've put your keen
and penetrating mind to the task

797
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:03,060
and as usual,
come to the wrong conclusion.

798
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,854
我一直很喜歡天狼星這個角色
I always loved the character
of Sirius

799
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:07,815
我喜歡哈利和天狼星的關係
I loved the relationship
Harry and Sirius have.

800
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,525
他就像很酷的叔叔
He's, like, this cool uncle

801
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:11,610
－還有哥哥，還有…
－是的
- but also older brother figure, and.
- Yeah.

802
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:14,446
他被描繪成惡棍
He's painted as this villainous guy

803
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,032
但到了關鍵的一刻，你會發現
and then has the switch where you go

804
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:19,785
他被陷害了，他是個好人
"Oh, he was set up."

805
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:19,785
And he's a good guy.

806
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:22,329
他是那麼的善良又溫暖
而且還很酷
And he's so kind and so warm

807
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:22,663
- and cool, yeah.
- And he's warm and kind and...

808
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,081
他真的很酷
- He's kind of cool.
- Yeah.

809
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:27,668
－是的
－我希望能看到所有故事
I wish I had had the whole picture.

810
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,713
－我們只是發現…
－是的，一本接著一本書
You know,
we only ever found out book.

811
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,630
- Yeah, book by book.
- I don't know whether you were

812
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:32,840
－我不知道，因為你是哈利
－我沒有
- because you were Harry Potter
- Just Rickman.

813
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:34,758
里克曼有看到
- and you had a, you...
- Rickman did, that was it.

814
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,094
－里克曼？
－他有內線
- Rickman?
- He had the inside line.

815
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,387
他還假裝得很好
- How did he work that one out?
- He very, very early said to Jo

816
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,139
他很早就對ＪＫ羅琳說

817
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,766
「我需要知道會發生什麼事」
he was like, "I think
I need to know what happens."

818
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,351
「我需要知道」
I need to know.

819
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:48,731
給我一個理由，我求你
Give me a reason, I bet you.

820
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:50,149
里克曼會加入的，不是嗎？
Rickman would have an in,
wouldn't he?

821
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:51,483
他做到了，是的
- He did, yeah.
- He, he...

822
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,444
他從未告訴克里斯
他從未告訴任何人
And he never told Chris,
never told anyone. He would...

823
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,696
克里斯會直接對他說
「你為什麼要那樣做？」
Chris would literally say to him,
"Why are you doing that that way?"

824
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,323
他說「我晚點告訴你」
He said, " I'll tell you later."
That was, that...

825
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,414
你會發現的
如果真的需要知道的話
Yeah, you'll find out.

826
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,080
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, on a need-to-know basis.

827
00:37:05,497 --> 00:37:06,832
沒錯
Way to get...

828
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:10,169
丹不是童星，他是演員
Dan was not a child actor,
he was another fellow actor.

829
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:12,212
艾方索說「現在你是青少年了」
- Alfonso was like
- Right.

830
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,089
「我會像對待
青少年一樣對待你」
- "Now you're teenagers
- Yeah.
and I'm gonna treat you
like a teenager."

831
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:15,257
他是第一個
And he was the first one who, like

832
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:17,926
－安排作業給我們的人
－是的
- assigned us homework.
- Yeah.

833
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,386
放鬆
Listen up, listen up.

834
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,347
他想了解我們
He wanted to get to know us

835
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,848
他安排了這個練習
so he set us this exercise

836
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:26,185
他讓我們寫一篇關於角色的作業
where he asked us
to write an essay in character.

837
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,940
他就說
「你現在理解這些角色了」
And he was like, "You know
these characters at this point better

838
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:35,069
「而我永遠無法理解他們是誰」
than I'm ever gonna be able
to understand who they are

839
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,362
「所以由你來告訴我」
so you tell me."

840
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:40,157
在寫了大約半張紙之後，我想說
And after about sort of
a half a side of A4

841
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,242
我幾乎涵蓋了所有內容
I was like, "I feel like I've
pretty much covered everything."

842
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,537
ＪＫ羅琳寫了五百頁
Like, Jo's written a good 500 pages
about this

843
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:48,207
但我覺得我總結得差不多
but I feel like this one
pretty much sums it up.

844
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,417
感覺蠻不錯的，就這樣吧
Great. Okay, yeah, cool.
Proud of that, bring that in.

845
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:55,964
艾瑪寫了１２頁，寫得很好
Of course, Emma writes, like,
12 pages, like, beautifully written.

846
00:37:56,507 --> 00:38:00,052
魯伯特沒有交任何東西
Rupert didn't deliver anything.

847
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:01,387
我沒有寫
I didn't do it.

848
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,806
我說「魯伯特，你的作業呢？」
And I said,
"Rupert, where's your assignment?"

849
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:08,727
他說「我以為榮恩不會寫」
And he says, "Well,
I thought that Ron wouldn't do it.

850
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,980
「所以我沒有寫」
So I didn't do it."

851
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:14,316
幸好艾方索看到了…
I mean, luckily Alfonso kind of saw
that it was very in character

852
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,403
沒有這樣做對我來說
非常符合角色

853
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,403
for me not to have done it.

854
00:38:17,486 --> 00:38:20,906
魯伯特就是榮恩
Rupert is Ron.

855
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,867
他是榮恩，百分之百
He's Ron 100 percent.

856
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:29,039
艾瑪就是這樣一個
毫不費力的演員
Emma is just
such an effortless actor.

857
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,457
她準備了很多
She prepares a lot.

858
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,545
在拍攝時，好像一切
都從她身上流出來了
When you are doing the scenes

859
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,545
it's as if everything
is just flowing out of her.

860
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,548
真相是，他們是很棒的演員
The truth of the matter is that
they are great actors.

861
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,760
天狼星布萊克找到了救贖
Sirius Black finds a redemption

862
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:46,223
透過讓哈利了解他的真實身份
by having Harry understanding
who he truly is.

863
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:50,018
這是一個偉大的解放
偉大的自由的時刻
It's, it's a moment of,
of great liberation, of great freedom

864
00:38:50,102 --> 00:38:55,816
而這一切都透過他們兩個
在有著銀月的夜空飛翔
and all of this
is conveyed symbolically

865
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,359
in the two of them flying
in the night under the silver moon.

866
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:57,192
而傳達出來

867
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,324
這就像一個家庭，不是嗎？
- It was like a family, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

868
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:08,036
－是的
－這是最難能可貴的經驗
More than any other experience.

869
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,747
從來沒有在電影裡有過這種經驗
But you never have that in the movies

870
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,083
因為你和一群人一起工作
並且你對他們很友好
because you've worked
with a bunch of people

871
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:12,875
and you get friendly with them

872
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,961
你之後將再也見不到大多數人
and then most of them,
you would never see again.

873
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:19,381
但是有了這部電影，你會回來的
But with Potter, you would come,
you would come back and...

874
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,884
這就是這部電影的可貴之處
- Yeah, that that's what made it
- I, yeah.

875
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:25,095
在許多事情中
這讓這部電影如此特別
amongst many things,
what made it very special.

876
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:27,389
是的，感覺就像…
- Yeah. It just feels like, you know
- Yeah.

877
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:29,600
在這裡
你會成為電影史的一部分
being in these,
you get to be a part of film history.

878
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:36,273
（全新的時代）

879
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:45,032
霍格華茲被選中舉辦三強爭霸賽
Hogwarts has been chosen
to host the Triwizard Tournament.

880
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:49,036
{\an5}火盃的考驗
Goblet of Fire, doing all
of the Triwizard Tournament stuff

881
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,247
{\an5}在所有三強爭霸賽期間

882
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:57,127
融入這樣魔法般的場景
it was so lovely to be surprised
and blown away

883
00:39:57,211 --> 00:40:04,218
讓人覺得很不可思議
and, like, taken away
by the magic of the scenes

884
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:03,884
and to be surprised.

885
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,304
我記得看到波巴洞入場的樣子
Like, I remember
seeing the Beauxbatons come

886
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,764
and do their entrance,
and the Durmstrangs.

887
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:08,680
和德姆斯特朗

888
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:10,766
真的很酷
It was really cool.

889
00:40:13,101 --> 00:40:15,687
在第四部電影中
我們想要一位英國導演
With the fourth film,
we wanted a British director.

890
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,356
我們想要一些非常戲劇化的東西
We wanted something quite theatrical.

891
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:18,732
停，非常感謝你
Cut. Thank you very much.

892
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:23,821
麥可就是這麼興奮又吵鬧
Mike is just this excited, loud,
passionate man.

893
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,781
他是個熱情的男人

894
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,409
他是那部電影的完美導演
He was a perfect director
for that film.

895
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,037
真的，就像誇張的…
It was a really, like, bombastic,
action-packed

896
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,916
動感十足、精彩、古怪的電影

897
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:35,916
wonderful, eccentric film.

898
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,167
我愛麥可，他很棒
I love Mike, he was great.

899
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,670
他幾乎就像書中角色一樣
I mean, he was almost like
he was from the books.

900
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:42,589
他就像霍格華茲的角色
He was like a Hogwarts character.

901
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,925
{\an5}第四本書是其中最厚的一本書
The fourth book
is the biggest of them

902
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:47,636
{\an5}大約有九百頁，像門擋
it's about 900 pages,
it's a doorstop.

903
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,012
{\an5}像磚頭一樣
It's a house brick.

904
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,472
開始
Action!

905
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:55,644
我想如果需要讓這些孩子
乖乖坐好聽話
And I thought

906
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,644
if it's really gonna nail
the little darlings to their seats

907
00:40:55,727 --> 00:41:01,525
那就會需要一個
強大又充滿活力的核心人物
then it has to have this great,
big, energetic core to it.

908
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,736
他就是這樣，能量滿滿
He was just this kind of, like,
firecracker of energy.

909
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,405
他對事物充滿好奇
He gets so excited by things.

910
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:10,659
{\an5}他有一種很童趣的特質
And there was this kind
of really endearing, like

911
00:41:08,824 --> 00:41:11,201
childlike quality to, to him.

912
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,911
他也很幽默
He loved the humor as well

913
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:15,372
總是會在每個場景中製造歡樂
and would always try
and find it in every scene.

914
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:20,252
我大概只有對幾部電影
感到有點緊張
It was probably
only a couple of films in

915
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,502
that I sort of started
to feel nervous.

916
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,378
我記得
- And I remember, it was Mike Newell.
- Yeah, things changed

917
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:23,380
哥倫布離開後，事情發生了變化
when, when Columbus left.

918
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:24,715
肯定有點不同
It was definitely a bit
of a difference.

919
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,800
那是一種不同的氛圍
我認為麥可尼維爾
- Yeah.
- It was a different vibe.
And then Mike Newell.

920
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,385
麥可像對待成年人一樣對待我們
Mike treated us like adults.

921
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:29,595
－沒錯
－是的
- That was it.
- Yeah.

922
00:41:29,678 --> 00:41:31,513
－的確
－是的
- He did, I suppose.
- Yeah.

923
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:33,223
{\an5}我們在片場玩得很開心
We did have fun on set.

924
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,147
我非常喜歡的衛斯理雙胞胎
The Weasley twins, whom I, I
was very fond of, they had to fight.

925
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,691
他們不得不打一架

926
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:47,237
{\an5}當弗雷德和喬治
被拒絕參與三強爭霸賽
We were doing the scene
when Fred and George

927
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,029
are rejected from entering
the Triwizard Tournament

928
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:50,115
我們戴上假髮和鬍鬚
and then we had these wigs on
and beards on

929
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:51,450
看起來像老男人
what looked like old men.

930
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,369
麥可說「你們會互相看不順眼」
And Mike said,
"Okay, so I think you guys

931
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:54,369
would be really annoyed
with each other

932
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:56,204
「你們應該好好打一架」
I think you should have
a little fight about this."

933
00:41:56,288 --> 00:42:00,292
這兩個人打得很不乾脆
These two were sort of
prissing about at it.

934
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,044
卡
Cut!

935
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:04,630
我說「孩子們，不會吧？
你們是在打架耶」
And I said, "No, come on boys,
really, it's a fight."

936
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:06,590
麥可剛走過來說「不行…」
Mike just came over and said,
"No, no, no."

937
00:42:06,673 --> 00:42:08,216
誰想打架？
Okay, who wants to fight?

938
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,303
我就像白痴一樣說「我想」
And like an idiot,
I was like, "Yeah, okay."

939
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:15,807
我那時是個６０歲的胖子
Well, of course, I was a tubby,
60-year-old gent at that stage

940
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:20,270
我真的不應該這樣做
and I really shouldn't have done it.

941
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:24,775
他向我撲了過去，就像這樣
And so he dived on me,
and like just went like this

942
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:27,945
我也對他做了同樣的事情
to which is said "Oh, okay,"
so I did the same to him.

943
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,948
我記得摟著他的腰
I remember gripping him
around the waist

944
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:33,367
並試圖甩開他
and trying to fling him about
and so forth

945
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,036
結果弄斷了幾根肋骨
and cracked a couple of ribs.

946
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,539
所以從那時起
我就處於極度的痛苦之中
And so was in absolute agony from,
from then on, but of course

947
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,000
當然，美妙的事情在於
the wonderful thing was that
I had made a complete twit of myself

948
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:44,795
我做了一個徹頭徹尾的蠢事

949
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:47,673
但之後大家都演得好多了
and everybody felt much better
for that.

950
00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:50,592
真的不該弄斷導演的肋骨
You know when you shouldn't break
a director's rib?

951
00:42:55,681 --> 00:43:00,477
（空中魔法）

952
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,689
在「火盃的考驗」中
In the Goblet of Fire, that film is
just all about teenagers, you know

953
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:08,610
那部電影是關於
青少年的第一次暗戀

954
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:09,486
having crushes for the first time,
asking someone to the date

955
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:11,071
邀請某人約會，去聖誕舞會
to the Yule Ball.

956
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:14,157
反映了你經歷的那些尷尬的階段
They just mirrored all those kind
of awkward phases you go through

957
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,493
作為一個青少年
大家都感同身受
as a teenager,
and they really felt like that too

958
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:19,037
因為我們確實有相同的經歷
because we were literally
having the same experiences.

959
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:21,873
在準備和指導的時候
The amount of, like,
prep and coaching Emma and I

960
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:25,043
艾瑪和我會互相發簡訊
比如給異性發簡訊
would give each other on, like,
texting to the opposite sex, like

961
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:27,295
如果她給男孩發簡訊
或者我給女孩發簡訊
if we, if she was texting a boy
or I was texting a girl

962
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:28,922
我會說
「她回了我這麼多親吻符號」
I'd be like, "She sent me
this many kisses back

963
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,632
「我該怎麼辦？這是一場噩夢」
it what do I do?
This is a nightmare."

964
00:43:30,716 --> 00:43:34,219
我們就像兄妹
We had that kind of older brother,
younger sister thing.

965
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:36,471
就荷爾蒙大爆發的時期而言
It was a very interesting film

966
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,348
這是一部非常有趣的電影
in terms of a lot of hormones
flying around.

967
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:43,395
有暗戀，約會然後分手
There was crushes

968
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,103
and people went out with each other
and broke up

969
00:43:43,478 --> 00:43:45,772
{\an5}就像我以前在學校那樣
and just like you'd do in,
just like I used to do at school.

970
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,191
{\an5}完全一樣的環境
It was exactly the same environment

971
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,527
但是在黑魔法防禦術課上
but it was just in a defense
against the dark arts class.

972
00:43:54,072 --> 00:43:57,200
那部電影至少對我來說
可能是荷爾蒙高峰
That film was probably peak hormone,
at least for me.

973
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:00,370
（每日先知）

974
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,622
這正是你所期望的
It was exactly what you would expect

975
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:07,335
尤其是第四部電影
有波巴洞和德姆蘭的學生
and especially, like, the fourth film
was the one with, like

976
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,085
the Beauxbatons and the Durmstrangs.

977
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:11,548
有一群荷爾蒙過剩的青少年
So, like, you had a bunch of, like,
hormonal teenagers anyway

978
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:13,425
帶來兩大群人
and then, like, bring in
two massive groups of new people

979
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:17,345
新人，所有人
故意讓這部電影變得很性感

980
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,387
all of them are, like,
purposefully hot for the film.

981
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,890
所以…
So it's, yeah, it was...

982
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:21,558
那部電影是…一切都開始了
That, that film was, yeah,
it was all kicking off.

983
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:24,394
為什麼她們要成群結隊的？
Why do they have to travel in packs?

984
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,524
他就像一個笨拙的少年
非常不起眼
He is just like
slightly awkward teenage boy

985
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:29,149
in a very unremarkable way

986
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:32,611
這對故事中的主角來說非比尋常
which I suppose
feels sort of remarkable

987
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,944
for a hero character in something.

988
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:35,989
你殺了龍
如果你不能約會，誰可以？
You saved dragons.

989
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:35,822
If you can't get a date, who can?

990
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,824
我現在寧願去殺龍
I think I'd take the dragon
right now.

991
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,244
ＪＫ羅琳把那些年的他
寫的非常親切
Jo wrote him very endearingly
in those years

992
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:46,625
我覺得這不需要耗費一大場戲
and I feel like
it did not take a huge acting stretch

993
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:51,379
讓我利用我的尷尬
呈現書呆子少年的一面
for me to tap into my awkward
nerdy teenage side.

994
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:52,506
秋
Jo?

995
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:54,758
是的？
Yes?

996
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:58,804
你願意和我一起去舞會嗎？
I just wondered if maybe
you wanna go to the ball with me?

997
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:02,015
抱歉，我沒聽懂
Sorry? I didn't catch that.

998
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:04,226
這顯然是一個成長的故事
It obviously was a coming
of age story.

999
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:11,942
聖誕舞會是其中一個大場面
One of the, the big,
big sequences was the Christmas Ball.

1000
00:45:12,025 --> 00:45:16,238
聖誕舞會首先是…
The Yule Ball is first
and foremost a dance.

1001
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,490
一支舞

1002
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,577
學生們學跳舞時的場景
The scene when the students
are learning to dance

1003
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:25,497
這很像那個時代典型的學校舞會
it was pretty much like
a typical school dance of that age.

1004
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,166
一邊是女孩，一邊是男孩
You've got girls on one side,
boys on the other.

1005
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,710
我們在牛津的一個大房間裡
We were in a big room in Oxford.

1006
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:34,589
瑪姬就在中間
說「我來教你們跳舞」
Maggie is right in the middle,
and she says

1007
00:45:32,754 --> 00:45:34,589
"Right,
I'm gonna teach you to dance."

1008
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,758
她當然選了魯伯特
Of course, she picks Rupert
and she says...

1009
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:38,593
然後她說…

1010
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:41,471
把右手放在我的腰上
Place your right hand on my waist.

1011
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:42,597
哪裡？
What?

1012
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:46,268
孩子都１４歲了，一定會很尷尬
The kid's 14
and he knows how to get a laugh.

1013
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:47,644
太棒了
It's great.

1014
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:50,272
好奇怪，我覺得很不自在
And weirdly,
I felt quite self-conscious about it.

1015
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:54,401
我也不知道
我以前從未和女士跳舞
I didn't really know,
I had never danced with a lady before

1016
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:56,153
所以這是一種非常新的體驗
so it was kind of a very new thing.

1017
00:45:57,112 --> 00:45:59,030
千萬別讓他忘記這一刻
Never gonna let me forget this,
are you?

1018
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:00,157
－好
－好
- Never.
- Never.

1019
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,617
當然了
詹姆斯和奧利弗那對雙胞胎
And yeah, of course, that
James and Oliver, the twins

1020
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:05,245
他們不斷嘲笑我
they were constantly
kind of ruining me.

1021
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:07,122
我們在捉弄他
- We were winding him up
- And we would wind up

1022
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,166
－事先就開始捉弄了
－在我們開始拍攝前
- anyway beforehand, we were like...
- before we started filming.

1023
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:12,460
在我們拍攝之前，他們說服我
They kind of convinced me
before we filmed it

1024
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:14,629
有舞蹈編排
that there was this whole like,
dance routine planned.

1025
00:46:14,713 --> 00:46:16,506
我們說
「你還不知道怎麼做嗎？」
We were like,
"Oh, do you know your steps?"

1026
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:20,510
「就是舞蹈編排啊
我們都有舞蹈編排」
Hey? And it's like,
"No, you know, the routine.

1027
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:22,512
「過去六週都是」
Like, we've all been doing a routine
for like the past six weeks
or something like that."

1028
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:25,390
只是試圖建立壓力
Just tried to build the pressure.

1029
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:27,559
就這樣
And this way.

1030
00:46:27,642 --> 00:46:30,145
不，你最終將帶領舞伴
Now, you will have to lead
eventually.

1031
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:31,438
明白了嗎？
Understood?

1032
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:32,522
Cut!

1033
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:37,277
最迷人的日子之一是大舞會
One of the most enchanting days
was the great ball

1034
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,615
{\an5}因為有很多年輕貌美的演員
because there was all these
incredibly beautiful young people

1035
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,824
{\an5}穿著漂亮的衣裳
perfectly dressed.

1036
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:45,827
該死
Bloody hell.

1037
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,335
那些是什麼？
What are those?

1038
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,293
What are those?

1039
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:54,920
我的禮服長袍
My dress robes.

1040
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:58,006
我們穿的西裝有非常寬的翻領
The suits we had on were like
really, really wide lapels and long

1041
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:01,134
和長長的下擺，你沒有…
sort of, tails and yeah

1042
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:05,096
完全都不覺得很酷
you didn't, you didn't feel cool at,
at really any point in that.

1043
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,057
我看起來像我的大姨媽泰西
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie.

1044
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:12,187
我聞起來像我的大姨媽泰西
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

1045
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,398
我只記得，那套禮服真的很扯
All I can remember is that,
like, really aggressive, like

1046
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:19,361
－有六層領子的東西？
－小褶邊的東西
six layer collar thing you had on.

1047
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:19,277
Oh, the little frill thing, yeah.

1048
00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:23,073
其實我有點喜歡
非常有衛斯理的風格
But actually, I kind of loved it.

1049
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:23,156
It was kind of, it was very Weasley.

1050
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:25,242
－是的，很完美
－但我表現得很讚
- Yeah, it was perfect.
- I felt, I pulled it off.

1051
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,743
沒有人能像我這樣
Not a lot of people
could pull it off.

1052
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:28,495
艾瑪看起來很漂亮
Emma obviously looked beautiful,
and was in an incredible dress.

1053
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:30,747
穿著一件令人難以置信的禮服

1054
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,583
我和魯伯特看起來像…我不知道
And me and Rupert looked like,
I don't know, Austin Powers mates

1055
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:37,170
奧斯汀鮑爾斯的伙伴
或其他人在一旁
or something,
hanging out at the side.

1056
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,382
她看起來很漂亮
She looks beautiful.

1057
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,677
我第一次覺得哈利和榮恩…
I think for the first time,
Harry and Ron

1058
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,220
尤其是榮恩
particularly Ron

1059
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:51,184
把妙麗看成一個年輕的女人
see Hermione as a young woman

1060
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:55,230
而不僅僅是一般的三人組
not just this kind of side kick
that they each have.

1061
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:57,440
那是妙麗格蘭傑嗎？
Is that Hermione Granger
with Viktor Krum?

1062
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,984
和維克多喀浪一起？

1063
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,404
不，絕對不可能
No. Absolutely not.

1064
00:48:03,863 --> 00:48:05,824
每個人都有這樣的經驗
I mean, everyone can kind
of relate to that

1065
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:07,534
這就是我喜歡這些故事的原因
that's what I kind of love
about these stories

1066
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:10,495
與每個人的生活相關
is they sit so parallel
to everyone's life

1067
00:48:10,578 --> 00:48:12,539
像是第一場學校舞會
like the first school dance
and those kind of emotions

1068
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,833
還有那種情緒

1069
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:18,253
那些焦慮，不安全感
those, those anxieties, insecurities.

1070
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:21,756
我知道這是一件大事，我很痛苦
I knew it was a big deal,
and I was miserable.

1071
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,091
我…
I, I just knew it was the, like,
duckling becomes a swan moment

1072
00:48:23,174 --> 00:48:28,013
我只知道這是
醜小鴨變成天鵝的時刻

1073
00:48:28,096 --> 00:48:30,682
突然間所有壓力都來到我肩上
and, you know, it was just like
all of this pressure suddenly.

1074
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:33,518
不要甩手臂好嗎？
Now, don't swing your arms, okay?

1075
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:37,272
麥可尼維爾教我
穿著禮服走下樓梯
Mike Newell coached me
to walk down the stairs in the dress.

1076
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,691
「你的手臂甩得太厲害了
你走得太快了」
Your arms are swinging too much

1077
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:41,484
you're walking too quickly,
you need to walk slower.

1078
00:48:39,774 --> 00:48:41,651
「你需要走得慢一點」

1079
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:44,946
他教我走下樓梯的一百萬種方式
Like, he's giving me
a million different directions

1080
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:44,904
about how to walk down the stairs

1081
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,365
後來我從樓梯上摔下來了
and of course,
I fell down the stairs.

1082
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:51,911
我們是一群非常不自在的青少年
We were a bunch
of very self-conscious teenagers

1083
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:54,331
that were like, you're gonna
learn some dance steps for this.

1084
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,080
你會為此學習一些舞步

1085
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,999
你相信我吧？
You trust me, don't you?

1086
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:58,376
好吧，我不是舞者
我永遠不會跳舞
I am not a dancer,
and I will never be able to dance.

1087
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,255
我覺得我在跳舞時很僵硬
Yeah, I feel like I'm pretty rigid
in, in that dance scene.

1088
00:49:06,051 --> 00:49:08,470
看…
Oh, look at that, look at that.
Stylish.

1089
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:10,388
幸運的人
Lucky man, lucky man.

1090
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:13,725
艾瑪和我一直很相愛，真的
Emma and I have always
loved each other, really.

1091
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:16,728
我走進指導室
I walked into the room
where we were having tutoring.

1092
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:21,733
我們要畫出心中認為上帝的樣子
The assignment that had been given

1093
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,274
was to draw
what you thought God looked like.

1094
00:49:21,816 --> 00:49:26,696
湯姆在滑板上
畫了一個帽子反戴的女孩
And Tom had drawn a girl
with a backward cap on a skateboard.

1095
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:31,159
不知道該怎麼說，我愛上了他
And I just don't know to say it,
like I just fell in love with him.

1096
00:49:31,242 --> 00:49:33,078
我在化妝椅上
I think I was in the hair
and makeup chair

1097
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:34,245
（跩哥馬份）

1098
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:37,415
有人說「她對你有好感」
and someone said
something along the lines of

1099
00:49:36,164 --> 00:49:37,415
"Yeah, she had a crush on you."

1100
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:42,003
我以前每天都進來在課表上
找他的號碼，是７號
I used to come in every day

1101
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,668
and look for his number
on the call sheet.

1102
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:42,170
It was number seven.

1103
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:45,256
如果他的號碼在課表上
And if it, if his number
was on the call sheet

1104
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,384
那將會是令人興奮一整天
it was an extra exciting day.

1105
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:51,137
他比我年長三年，所以對他來說
He was three years above me,
and so for him, he was like

1106
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,348
我是他的小妹妹
"You're like my little sister."

1107
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:55,642
我變得非常保護她
I was, became very protective
over her.

1108
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:58,728
我一直對她情有獨鍾
Yeah, I've always
had a soft spot for, for her.

1109
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:01,022
一直到今天都是
And that continues to the day.

1110
00:50:01,106 --> 00:50:03,149
我認為像是…
I think, really, the truth of it
was Tom was the one

1111
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:09,072
我跟湯姆在一起不用裝堅強

1112
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:08,988
that I could often be
more vulnerable with.

1113
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:11,866
我們總有一種親切感
There's always been something
that's like, I don't know, a kinship.

1114
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,079
我們之間沒有任何浪漫情懷
Nothing has ever, ever, ever, ever
happened romantically with us

1115
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:17,372
我們純粹很敬愛彼此
we just love each other.

1116
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:20,333
我只能說這麼多
That's all I can say about that.

1117
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:29,175
－一起來，一、二、三
－二、三
- Together. One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1118
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:39,185
在「火盃的考驗」裡
宇宙改變了
In the Goblet of Fire

1119
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:43,648
the universe shifts and suddenly,
there is Voldemort.

1120
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:43,773
突然間有了佛地魔

1121
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,362
（那個不能說出名字的人）

1122
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,282
我選了羅夫費恩斯
I cast Ralph Fiennes

1123
00:50:52,365 --> 00:50:56,619
是因為他是那一代
最會演的演員之一
because he's one of the most
potent actors of his generation

1124
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:59,664
我知道他有很強的力量
and I knew that he had a great force,
just kind of delicate

1125
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:04,002
他有細膩微妙的人格力量

1126
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,461
subtle force of personality.

1127
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:09,257
我姊妹當時有約十幾歲大的孩子
My sister has children who were
then around 10, 11, 12.

1128
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,802
{\an5}我說「瑪莎，我沒聽過
哈利波特和佛地魔」
I said, "Martha, I don't know about
this Harry Potter thing, Voldemort.

1129
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:14,220
{\an5}「那是什麼？」
What's that?"

1130
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,765
{\an5}她說「什麼？
你受邀飾演佛地魔？」
"What? You're being asked
to play Voldemort?

1131
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,434
「你一定要演」
You've got to do it."

1132
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:28,818
然後他們給我看了
繪圖和外觀的設計概念
Yes, when I was shown some drawings

1133
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:30,820
of design ideas for the look,
I wasn't expecting that.

1134
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:31,404
我沒有預期是那個樣子

1135
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,615
我想「這外觀真強烈」
And I thought,
"Wow, that's a strong look."

1136
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:36,451
我那時不覺得佛地魔是人
I didn't feel Voldemort
was that human.

1137
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:38,870
我覺得他是邪惡的精髓
I felt he was the essence of evil.

1138
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:40,538
我知道他當過人類
I know he's been human,
but he's become a snake-like thing.

1139
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:42,999
但他成了跟蛇一樣的人

1140
00:51:43,082 --> 00:51:47,128
聲音是像蛇低語那般沙啞
So there was the voice,
that sort of snake-like whispered

1141
00:51:46,127 --> 00:51:52,008
husky, something that I suppose
I was sort of whispering voice

1142
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:51,424
我認為像是低語的聲音

1143
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:53,885
呼吸的聲音
breath on the breath.

1144
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,221
「哈利波特」
Ah, Harry Potter.

1145
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:58,515
來受死吧
Come to die?

1146
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:03,770
羅夫想變得極端邪惡超凡
Ralph wanted to be ultimately evil
and other worldly.

1147
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:07,857
最棒的方法就是拿掉他的鼻子
And the best way to do that
was to take his nose off.

1148
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,610
他是有鼻子，劇透警告
He does have a nose, spoiler alert.

1149
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:12,862
他渾身滿是貼紙
And he was covered in stickers.

1150
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:16,908
所以他看起來沒螢幕上那麼嚇人
So, he was slightly less intimidating
than on screen.

1151
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:18,618
他們說「開演」時除外
Except when they called action

1152
00:52:18,701 --> 00:52:20,662
不知怎地，我很怕他
when for some reason
I was terrified of him.

1153
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,998
可以碰你了
I can touch you.

1154
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,376
要花三個鐘頭化妝
It took about three hours in makeup

1155
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:28,545
畫手、指甲、牙齒
the painting of the hands,
the nails, the teeth.

1156
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:31,130
連我的鼻子都不例外
And even with my nose, I felt...

1157
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,217
我感覺…

1158
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,681
很強壯，感覺很強大
strong. It felt powerful.
It felt evil.

1159
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:41,391
感覺很邪惡

1160
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,478
最重要的是
What was big was that one
of the people that you assume

1161
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:49,607
大家以為會是故事中的重要人物

1162
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:51,359
is going to be very important
in the story is Cedric Diggory.

1163
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:51,609
西追迪哥里

1164
00:52:51,693 --> 00:52:55,822
在那場對抗之中，西追被殺害
In that confrontation Cedric
is killed.

1165
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:57,782
把多餘的人殺了
Kill the spare.

1166
00:52:57,865 --> 00:53:00,076
－啊哇呾喀呾啦
－不，西追
- Avada Kedavra!
- Cedric!

1167
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,122
而哈利呢…
And Harry,
he manages to take the body

1168
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:07,208
他帶走了屍體

1169
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:12,297
在比賽最後被迫降
and crash land back
at the end of the competition

1170
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,092
西追迪哥里的父親
以為他兒子贏了
and Cedric Diggory's father
believes that his son has won

1171
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:19,178
然後他發現他孩子死了
and then he realizes the kid is dead
and he howls like a dog.

1172
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,556
他就跟狗一樣哀號

1173
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,016
我的兒子
It's my boy!

1174
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:27,895
兒子
My boy!

1175
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,068
突然間，完全出乎預料
事情變得很嚴重
Suddenly something
completely unexpected

1176
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,527
and serious happens.

1177
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:38,990
你突然了解這部電影
不是講生命，而是講死亡
And suddenly you realize
that this move is not about life.

1178
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:39,032
It's about death.

1179
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:43,369
那一幕很重要
因為那也是哈利第一次
It's such a massive scene

1180
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:42,952
because it is also the first time
Harry, sort of

1181
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:47,332
感覺年輕人的死亡這麼靠近他
feels that kind of death
of somebody young, close to him.

1182
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,044
我在那一幕很清楚地想
That's a scene I remember
really distinctly going

1183
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,754
「這是兒童電影」
"Oh, this is, yes,
these are kid's films but my God

1184
00:53:52,837 --> 00:53:54,589
「但是天啊，這主題真沉重」
there's some challenging stuff
in there.

1185
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:56,549
他回來了…
He's back. He's back.

1186
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,052
佛地魔王他回來了
Voldemort's back.

1187
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,387
西追迪哥里去世那一刻
The moment of Cedric Diggory's death

1188
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,516
是這一系列變成熟的時刻
is the moment when the series
comes of age

1189
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:10,063
現在，兒童脫離了童年
and now the children
have left childhood

1190
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,901
得面對成年的危險
and are going to have to confront
the perils of adulthood

1191
00:54:14,984 --> 00:54:17,779
都從那一刻的死亡開始
and it all comes
from that moment of death.

1192
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:22,325
西追迪哥里被佛地魔謀殺了
Cedric Diggory was murdered
by Lord Voldemort.

1193
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,287
他們三個面對逆境
The three of them,
they're in adversity

1194
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:30,249
因此建立了我們所知的友誼
and that forges friendships
as we know.

1195
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:43,012
「簡而言之你受到
你能愛人的能力保護」
"You are protected, in short,
by your ability to love"

1196
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:45,765
鄧不利多大聲說
said Dumbledore loudly.

1197
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:48,601
「唯一有作用的保護」
"The only protection
that can possibly work

1198
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,105
「能對抗像佛地魔
這種力量誘惑的唯一保護」
against the lure of power
like Voldemort's.

1199
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:57,777
「即使你忍受所有誘惑和苦難」
In spite of all the temptation
you have endured

1200
00:54:55,942 --> 00:55:01,072
all the suffering,
you remain pure of heart."

1201
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,822
「你的心還保持純潔」

1202
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:04,867
（第三章，內心的光明與黑暗）

1204

{\an5}（海倫娜寶漢卡特
飾貝拉雷斯壯）

1207
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:17,255
{\an5}你讓我們在這裡訪談真好
It's so nice of you.
Let's do this in your house.

1208
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:18,965
{\an5}我知道，這樣真好
I know, it's too nice.

1209
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:21,634
你知道我一直想做什麼嗎？
You know what I've always
wanted to do?

1210
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,721
{\an5}看我們辦不辦得到
我想上去這裡
Let me see if we can,
is get up here.

1211
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:26,347
{\an5}（斜角巷，古靈閣巫師銀行）

1212
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:28,433
{\an5}你看，他們看起來不太健康
Oh, look, they really don't look
very well.

1213
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:32,270
－他們都還在這裡
－對啊
- They're all still here.
- They're really still here.

1214
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:35,523
有人餵他們吃飯嗎？真悲哀
I mean, has anyone fed them?
It is so sad.

1215
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:38,609
－好，你當哈利波特
－好，了解
- Okay, now you can be Harry Potter.
- Oh, yeah.

1216
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:39,235
Okay, thank you.

1217
00:55:41,362 --> 00:55:44,031
－我往右走，你往左走
－我們來比賽，好嗎？
I'll go down the right,
you go down the left.

1218
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,865
Yeah, and let's race. Okay?

1219
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:45,491
預備，準備，開始
- Okay.
- On your mark, get set, go.

1220
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,868
天啊
Oh, God.

1221
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,412
這裡下不去
We're snogging down here.

1222
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:51,789
過去
Get over it.

1223
00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:54,667
{\an5}你知道嗎？我照了一張照片
You know what?
I took a photograph of something.

1224
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,920
我昨晚挖出這些東西
Last night I thought
I'm gonna just dig up these things

1225
00:55:58,004 --> 00:55:59,797
我要求了你的簽名
and I asked for your autograph.

1226
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:01,424
天啊，我寫了什麼？
Oh, God, what did I write?

1227
00:56:01,507 --> 00:56:04,802
不，大聲念出來，看到你真好
No, read it out.
It's so nice to see you.

1228
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:06,095
上面寫什麼？
- God.
- What does it say?

1229
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,680
－「親愛的海倫娜寶漢卡特」
－對
- "Dear HBC...
- Yeah.

1230
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,559
「我很榮幸當你的
共演演員和杯墊」
It was a pleasure being
your costar and coaster.

1231
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,270
我這個雙關語真好笑
What a... What a clever pun
I made when I was...

1232
00:56:14,353 --> 00:56:16,022
－真好笑
－我真的
That was clever.
- I mean, I'm honestly

1233
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,232
－還蠻滿意的
－你那時候很詩意，對
- still kind of pleased with that.
- You were poetic. Yeah, yeah.

1234
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,485
「因為我總淪落到幫你端咖啡」
"in the sense that I always ended up
holding your coffee. I do love you."

1235
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,820
－「我愛你」
－然後怎麼說？

1236
00:56:21,736 --> 00:56:22,820
Then what does it say?

1237
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:28,993
－你可以念出來
－我可以，我們可以跟觀眾分享
- You can share.
- I can.

1238
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:32,038
我說「我愛你
只希望能提早出生十年」
We can share this now. I said,
"I do love you

1239
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,996
and I just wish I'd been born
10 years earlier.

1240
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:33,414
「我可能還有一點機會」
I might have been in with a chance."

1241
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:34,665
現在沒關係了
It's all right now.

1242
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:36,250
「愛你，感謝你這麼酷」
"Lots of love
and thanks for being cool."

1243
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:37,376
很貼心對吧？
Isn't it nice?
No, I shall always treasure that.

1244
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,545
－我會永遠珍惜這個
－謝謝

1245
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,422
- Thank you.
- That is in my toilet, Dan.

1246
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,297
接下來就會出現在
我的馬桶裡了，丹

1247
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:49,847
風暴要來了，哈利
There's a storm coming, Harry.

1248
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:51,891
風暴來時，我們最好準備好
We'd all best be ready when she does.

1249
00:56:58,147 --> 00:57:00,691
我在第五部電影裡
「鳳凰會的密令」
I was in four, number five,
Order of the Phoenix.

1250
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:01,943
看，我帶了我的假牙
- Yeah.
- Look, I got my teeth.

1251
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:03,653
－海倫娜帶了她的假牙
－我的假牙，我認為…
- Helena has brought her teeth.
- My teeth. I think, no...

1252
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,989
她跟我保證過
她沒清過這副假牙
She has assured me that she's done
literally nothing to these

1253
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,908
- in terms of, cleaning...
- No, these are actual relic.

1254
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:08,741
不，這是真正的古物

1255
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,493
已經１１年了，而且…
It was 11 years in...

1256
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,578
－對
－對，聞起來有點臭
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it smells a bit wifty. But...

1257
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:13,788
可是…

1258
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:15,873
－你要把假牙放進你嘴裡
－但這副牙齒很有幫助
- You're just gonna put them...
- No, but the teeth were helpful.

1259
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,249
Just gonna put them right
in your mouth, yeah.

1260
00:57:15,957 --> 00:57:17,458
－好，放進去了
－對
Okay. In they go.

1261
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:19,752
－你認為呢？
－對，我都忘了
- What do you think?
- Yeah. I'd forgotten.

1262
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,213
－你記得我嗎？
－我記得這個，對
Do you... do you remember me?

1263
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:22,296
I remember these, yeah.

1264
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,844
－假牙很有幫助
－幫你演出那個角色
- The teeth helped.
- With the character?

1265
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:29,595
我認為我當時想偽裝
I think I wanted to be in camouflage.

1266
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,974
我一開始受邀演出時
ＪＫ羅琳傳給我一則祕密訊息
When I was first offered it
Joe sent me a secret message

1267
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:36,769
「劇本裡也許沒有太多描述
但她會做出大事」
saying like, "There might not
be much on the page

1268
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:36,644
but she's gonna do
something significant."

1269
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,020
貝拉這個角色很有趣
With Bellatrix it was fun
because it was posturing

1270
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:41,691
因為這個角色
有幼稚和頑皮的個性
the childish and the naughty.

1271
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:42,942
我說…
I was just like...

1272
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:44,402
－完全無政府主義
－精神病態，對
- and totally anarchist...
- And the psychopath.

1273
00:57:44,485 --> 00:57:45,987
她有種胡鬧的感覺
Yeah, there's like a playfulness
to her

1274
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,989
－有胡鬧感
－所以更令人不安
- There was the playfulness.
- which is like even more disturbing.

1275
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:49,574
當然了，貝拉不覺得自己很邪惡
Of course Bellatrix
doesn't think she's evil.

1276
00:57:49,657 --> 00:57:50,825
－不
－剛好相反
- No.
- She thinks she's the opposite.

1277
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:52,326
－對
－所以我得建構出
- Right.
- So, I had to sort of construct

1278
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,538
她傷害人的理由
a reason for why
she should hurt people and why

1279
00:57:55,621 --> 00:57:58,833
以及她為什麼這麼麻木
for her, she is desensitized.

1280
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:01,294
這讓她覺得自己很強大
It makes her feel powerful.

1281
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:05,715
小波特
Itty, bitty Potter.

1282
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:08,134
Yeah!

1283
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,098
{\an5}貝拉是個控制不了的狂野人物
Bellatrix was just this wild thing
that was uncontrollable.

1284
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:18,019
你不知道她會說出什麼話
You can really know what's gonna
come out of her mouth next.

1285
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:20,646
這對演員來說很興奮
Very exciting for an actor
because it's like

1286
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,273
因為她不管在那個鏡頭拍什麼
whatever she did on that take

1287
00:58:22,356 --> 00:58:25,109
不代表她下個鏡頭會演得一樣
does not mean she's gonna do
the same one the next.

1288
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:27,361
我記得自己想主宰那場戲
I remember trying to be
in charge of the scene

1289
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:29,614
而她就純粹想做什麼就做什麼
and her just having the best time.

1290
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:32,116
她想做什麼都沒人會管她
She's just allowed to do anything
she wanted.

1291
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:33,784
她可以咯咯笑、她可以上下跳…
She could cackle,
she could jump up and down.

1292
00:58:33,868 --> 00:58:35,202
冷靜
Calm down.

1293
00:58:35,286 --> 00:58:37,163
想說什麼就說什麼
And say whatever she wanted
and just not knowing...

1294
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:40,541
不知道…我想管她
not trying to keep her in tow.

1295
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,084
你這骯髒的混血
You filthy half-blood!

1296
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:44,629
沒關係，他只不過是好奇寶寶
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1297
00:58:44,712 --> 00:58:46,213
我一直想說「閉嘴」
I kept wanting to go, "Shut up."

1298
00:58:46,797 --> 00:58:48,007
跩哥
Draco.

1299
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:53,262
{\an5}（大廳
霍格華茲魔法與巫術學院）

1300
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:57,808
我殺了你，對吧？
- I killed you didn't I?
- You killed me but...

1301
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:00,311
－你殺了我，可是…
－對，對不起
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1302
00:59:00,394 --> 00:59:01,687
我得殺了你
Had to be done.

1303
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,814
我記得我們合作了
很多咒語之類的
I remember, we worked
on lots of spells and things

1304
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:06,692
你那時是很棒的巫師
我則是很棒的女巫
because you were
a really good wizard

1305
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:06,692
I was a really good witch.

1306
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,487
我們有很棒的好戲
他們砍掉了很多場戲
And we had a real duo
and they cut the whole lot.

1307
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:12,365
－我當時很不開心
－對
- Yeah.
- And I was really fessed up

1308
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,784
因為我想
「我上了魔杖學校幾週」
because I just thought I've been
to one school for weeks.

1309
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:16,911
我們在那個片場待了好幾天
And we were on that set for days.

1310
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:18,788
－拍好幾天
－對
Days. It was in the round.

1311
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:20,665
我認為那是我最初的幾場戲
- Yeah.
- I think it was really one
of my first things.

1312
00:59:20,748 --> 00:59:21,832
然後你掉進紗幕
And you fell into the Veil.
Wasn't it, the Veil?

1313
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:23,459
是紗幕嗎？
- Yeah, yeah, I go through the Veil.
- Was it?

1314
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:24,669
我掉進了紗幕

1315
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:28,673
然後變得很懸疑
他回不回得來？
Then there was speculation of
does he come back?

1316
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:30,633
－對
－人能從紗幕回來嗎？
- Can you come back from the Veil?
- Yeah.

1317
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,551
－不，沒辦法
－不行
- No, you can't.
- Yeah. No, you can't.

1318
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,970
啊哇呾喀呾啦
Avada Kedavra!

1319
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,531
我總說那時有個很有趣的一點
I've always say that there
was an interesting point

1320
00:59:53,614 --> 00:59:55,491
對我們這些年輕演員都一樣
for all of us, as like,
younger actors

1321
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:58,244
因為有個團體，像是瑪姬…
because there was certain group
like Maggie...

1322
00:59:58,327 --> 01:00:00,705
－對
－大衛布拉德利和艾倫
- Yeah.
- David Bradley and Alan.

1323
01:00:00,788 --> 01:00:02,790
他們從我們１０或１１歲
就認識我們
They'd known us
when we were 10 or 11.

1324
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:05,209
等你加入那時
我已經１５還１６歲了
- Yeah.
- And when you came in
- by that point I was like 15, 16.
- Yeah.

1325
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,128
－對
－所以你和蓋瑞和大衛…
So, like you and Gary and David, like

1326
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,171
－對
－都把我們當大人看
- would treat us more like adults.
- Yeah.

1327
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:13,050
我很喜歡，你視我們為準備好
- I loved it.
- You saw in us that like

1328
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:12,800
a few of us were like,
kind of ready to be like

1329
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:15,761
你能推動我
我們也想試著當演員
can you push me, like,
we wanna try and be actors too.

1330
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:22,143
（成長）

1331
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,397
等我們拍「鳳凰會的密令」時
By the time we get
to Order of the Phoenix

1332
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,150
世界變得越來越政治化
the world is becoming more political

1333
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,652
而我覺得我們需要一個導演
and I felt we needed a director
who could handle that

1334
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:34,238
能用有趣的方式處理
in an entertaining way.

1335
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:36,824
{\an5}大衛葉慈跟演員合作無間
David Yates works so well
with actors

1336
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:39,160
{\an5}他真的能推動演員的潛能
really pushes them in
all the right way.

1337
01:00:39,994 --> 01:00:45,916
不該鼓勵為了進步而進步
Progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

1338
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,462
大衛很好、很溫和
David was just such a sweet,
kind of gentle guy

1339
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,048
他很在乎這些角色
that really cared so much
about all of these characters.

1340
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,593
我們跟大衛
也有很多一對一的交流
And also, we had a lot of, kind of,
one on one with David Yates.

1341
01:00:55,676 --> 01:00:58,846
我參與「鳳凰會的密令」時
想著這些年輕演員
I went into Order of the Phoenix
with the young actors in mind

1342
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:02,391
想著我們怎麼讓電影茁壯
and sort of thinking about
how we sort of grow

1343
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:02,391
the whole thing up

1344
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:07,813
{\an5}讓電影變得更成人
更有主題性、更黑暗
and make it a little bit more adult

1345
01:01:04,685 --> 01:01:07,938
and sort of thematic
and a little darker.

1346
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:17,156
電影需要擴展更多
變得更大、更嚇人
It needed to expand and get bigger
and more and more frightening.

1347
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,955
越來越具規模、越來越複雜
There was a big increase
in scale and complexity

1348
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,584
{\an5}從幼稚變成到影響人的事件
from being childish
to influencing events

1349
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:31,462
{\an5}成為大世界的一部分
and being part of the big world.

1350
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:33,672
他只是個孩子
He's just a boy.

1351
01:01:34,215 --> 01:01:36,926
再說下去，乾脆讓他加入鳳凰會
You say much more
and you might as well induct him

1352
01:01:36,008 --> 01:01:38,052
- to the order straight away.
- Good, I want to join.

1353
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:38,052
好啊，我想加入

1354
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:40,304
佛地魔在重整軍隊，我要參戰
If Voldemort's raising an army
then I want to fight.

1355
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:49,313
剛開始時
大衛和電影公司跟我說
When I started one thing that David

1356
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:50,981
and the studio spoke to me about
was Emma is

1357
01:01:49,814 --> 01:01:54,443
就是艾瑪不想回來
拍另一部「哈利波特」電影

1358
01:01:51,065 --> 01:01:54,527
not sure she wants to come back
to do another Potter.

1359
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:56,737
哈利
Harry!

1360
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:02,618
大家絕對忘了她怎麼接下來
People definitely forget
what she took on

1361
01:02:02,701 --> 01:02:04,620
和她多有肚量地拍完電影
and how gracefully she did it.

1362
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:07,873
丹和魯伯特彼此支持
Dan and Rupert, they had each other.

1363
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,709
我有我的粉絲
I had my cronies,
whereas Emma was not only younger

1364
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,628
艾瑪不僅比我們年輕

1365
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,672
她還只能靠自己
she was... she was by herself.

1366
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:16,465
Emma!

1367
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,468
我找到一份日記
I did find a diary entry
that was kinda like...

1368
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:24,056
我看得出我有時候很孤獨
I can see that at times I was lonely.

1369
01:02:25,391 --> 01:02:26,976
我們在電影上都沒提到
We never talked about it on the film
because we were all just kids.

1370
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:28,602
因為我們那時候都還小

1371
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:32,356
身為１４歲的男孩，我不會回頭
As a 14-year-old boy
I was never gonna turn around

1372
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:35,317
去跟另一個１４歲的孩子說
「你好嗎？一切都好嗎？」
to another 14 year old and be like,
"Hey, how you doing?"

1373
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,985
Like, "Is everything okay?"

1374
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:38,070
「鳳凰會的密令」
So, Order of the Phoenix.

1375
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:40,948
對我們來說
那時一切開始變得很刺激
Was when things started
getting spicy for all of us.

1376
01:02:41,031 --> 01:02:42,533
但你那時候想退出？
But you were considering pulling out.

1377
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:44,160
我從沒跟你談過這件事
I never really spoken to you
about this.

1378
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:45,953
對，我認為…
Yeah. I think...
I think I was scared.

1379
01:02:46,954 --> 01:02:48,247
－我那時候很害怕
－對

1380
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,167
我不知道你有沒有感覺過
自己來到了某個臨界點
- Yeah.
- I don't know if...
if you ever felt like
it got to a tipping point

1381
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,668
－絕對有
－你就會開始想
- when you were like...
- Oh, absolutely.

1382
01:02:52,751 --> 01:02:54,170
「這現在變成永遠的事了」
- this is kinda forever now.
- Yeah.

1383
01:02:54,253 --> 01:02:57,631
對，我有遇過
從頭到尾都有這種感覺
No, I had moments like that,
kind of all the way through.

1384
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,678
我也跟艾瑪有一點類似的感覺
I also had kind of similar feelings
to Emma

1385
01:03:03,804 --> 01:03:07,474
有點考慮我要是棄拍
人生會怎樣
kind of contemplating what life
would be like if I called it a day.

1386
01:03:07,558 --> 01:03:10,102
但我們都沒談過這事
But... we never really
spoke about it.

1387
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,063
我們大概都用自己的步調
經歷這過程
I didn't... I guess we were
just kind of going through it

1388
01:03:13,147 --> 01:03:15,649
我們那時候有點身陷其中
at our own pace and we were kind of
in the moment at the time.

1389
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:17,776
我們沒真正想到…
It just didn't really occur to us

1390
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,906
我們都有點大概有類似的感覺
that we were all kind of having
similar... similar feelings.

1391
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:29,663
對，名氣的確大大影響了我們
Yeah, the fame thing had finally
hit home in a big way.

1392
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,460
我不用被人說服得拍完這些電影
No one had to convince me
to see it through.

1393
01:03:37,004 --> 01:03:39,340
影迷真的很想看我們成功
The fans genuinely wanted you
to succeed

1394
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,926
我們也真的都很想支持彼此
and we all genuinely have
each other's backs.

1395
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:43,969
這很棒，對吧？
How great is that?

1396
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,980
認識人總是很棒
It's always amazing meeting people.

1397
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,440
這些電影對他們意義重大
These films mean so much to them

1398
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:59,193
因為大家跟我們一起長大
because... they kind of
grew up alongside us

1399
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:02,655
這些電影幫大家
經歷人生困難的事物
and helped them with some really
difficult things in their lives.

1400
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:06,033
我很驕傲能夠參與
And I'm just very proud to be
a part of something

1401
01:04:06,116 --> 01:04:09,578
對很多人有重大意義的電影
that means so much to so many.

1402
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,754
我一直在想鄧不利多跟我說的事
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1403
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:20,631
什麼事？
What's that?

1404
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,676
我們必須面對一場戰鬥
That even though we've got
a fight ahead of us

1405
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,179
但是我們擁有佛地魔沒有的東西
we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1406
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,265
是什麼？
Yeah?

1407
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:33,060
值得我們捍衛的一切
Something worth fighting for.

1408
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:39,608
我兒子比利
我們以前每晚都看這些電影
My son, Billy, we used
to watch them every night.

1409
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:41,527
他要是遇到週日夜憂鬱
You know, if you got
the Sunday night blues

1410
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,280
他就會看「哈利波特」電影
it was watching a Potter movie.

1411
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:45,656
這些電影是他的安全之處
That was his safe place.

1412
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:47,491
我很期待有一天
I'm really looking forward
to watching the films

1413
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:49,618
跟我還沒出世的孩子們
看這些電影
with my hypothetical children
one day.

1414
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:51,203
這系列的影響很重大
- It's massive, the impact.
- Yeah.

1415
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,871
－很特別
－很難相信
- It is extraordinary.
- It is unbelievable.

1416
01:04:53,831 --> 01:04:56,959
（格格不入的人）

1417
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:00,170
{\an5}我從１１歲起就寫信給ＪＫ羅琳
I was writing to J.K. Rowling
since I was about 11 years old

1418
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:01,380
跟她道謝
to say thank you to her, to say

1419
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:04,466
跟她說「少了有哈利波特的人生
會變得有點絕望」
I would find life a bit hopeless
without Harry Potter.

1420
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:08,387
還好她讀了，也回了我的信
Luckily, for me, she read
the letter and responded to it.

1421
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:11,140
所以我算是少數幸運的人
So, I'm one of the very lucky
few people

1422
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:14,310
我可以說ＪＫ羅琳是我的筆友
who can say J.K. Rowling
was my pen friend.

1423
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:17,521
（你想拍電影嗎？）

1424
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,150
試鏡的第一階段
是這場瘋狂的公開試鏡
The first part of the audition
is this crazy open call.

1425
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,569
真的是人人都能參加
Literally, anyone can come.

1426
01:05:23,652 --> 01:05:25,237
（不用經驗亦可）

1427
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,573
那就是我的門票
開始了，我們去倫敦
That's my ticket. Off we go.
Let's go to London.

1428
01:05:28,032 --> 01:05:29,241
當然是用飛的啊
We fly, of course.

1429
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,078
有上千人排隊
And there would be thousands
of people lining up.

1430
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,956
我很清楚記得丹
I remember Dan, very vividly.

1431
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,374
那是我的試鏡
It was on my screen test.

1432
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,542
槲寄生
Mistletoe.

1433
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,377
（即興）

1434
01:05:40,461 --> 01:05:41,962
我記得他在跟我說話
I remember him talking to me

1435
01:05:42,046 --> 01:05:43,797
我一直忘記我得回覆他
and I kept forgetting that
I have to talk back to him

1436
01:05:43,881 --> 01:05:45,883
因為我很習慣看他在螢幕上
because I'm so used
to watching him on a screen.

1437
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,093
所以我就有點…
So I would just kind of be like...

1438
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:52,639
我認為這促成了
露娜羅古德的個性
And I kind of think that contributed
to the whole Luna Lovegood vibe.

1439
01:05:52,723 --> 01:05:54,391
因為她有點恍惚
Because she is a bit spacey.

1440
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:56,894
哈囉，各位
Hello, everyone.

1441
01:05:58,479 --> 01:05:59,646
你看起來很可怕，榮恩
You look dreadful, Ron.

1442
01:06:00,481 --> 01:06:05,235
然後他發現
這個怪胎異類的祕密世界
And then he found this
secret world of odd bods

1443
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:07,446
這些人擁有奇怪的力量
of misfits, of people
who had this strange power

1444
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:11,784
但他們還是有強烈的人性
深度、也很脆弱
but who still had enormous humanity
and depth and vulnerability.

1445
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:15,454
這些電影讓大家
接受自己的這個部分
The movies kinda
gave people permission

1446
01:06:13,827 --> 01:06:15,287
to accept parts of themselves.

1447
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:18,540
所以看到自己古怪的面向
So, it was quite liberating to see
your oddness as a superpower

1448
01:06:18,624 --> 01:06:21,168
在螢幕上有超能力
感覺讓人很自由

1449
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:21,752
represented on screen.

1450
01:06:21,835 --> 01:06:23,796
我記得我第一次看到你們大家
I remember when I first met you all

1451
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:26,715
這是我見過最大群的異類
biggest bunch of misfits
have I ever set eyes on.

1452
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,592
然後我們都在這裡
And here we all are.

1453
01:06:28,675 --> 01:06:30,052
我們還是一大群異類
We're still a bunch of misfits.

1454
01:06:30,135 --> 01:06:32,971
也許，可是我們擁有彼此
Well, maybe
but we've all got each other.

1455
01:06:33,972 --> 01:06:35,224
我那時對課業不在行
I was not good at school.

1456
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:37,476
你最好讀「高沙的藥草指南」
You'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1457
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:39,186
我朋友不多
I didn't have
a huge amount of friends.

1458
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:41,980
注意你的腳步，隆巴頓
Which way you going, Longbottom?

1459
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:45,734
我認為當異類很棒
I think it's great to be a misfit

1460
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:47,945
{\an5}我認為那就是
這系列受歡迎的原因
and I think that's possibly why
it's so popular.

1461
01:06:48,028 --> 01:06:50,948
{\an5}大家都想知道自己不會格格不入
Everyone wants to know
that they do belong.

1462
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:53,492
我認為這很能舒緩孤獨的感覺
It's a great relief of loneliness,
I think.

1463
01:06:53,575 --> 01:06:54,993
我小時候很害羞
I was quite a shy kid.

1464
01:06:55,077 --> 01:07:00,707
我能體會那種格格不入的感覺
I could relate to that
kind of feeling of

1465
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,707
not quite knowing what your place is.

1466
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:02,835
努力工作是很重要
Working hard is important.

1467
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,461
但有另一件事更重要
But there's something
that matters even more

1468
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:06,713
－咄咄失
－相信自己
- Stupefy!
- believing in yourself.

1469
01:07:08,757 --> 01:07:12,344
大家見證這些
格格不入的角色之後
Everyone felt more like they belonged

1470
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,055
都覺得自己更有歸屬感
by witnessing these characters
that didn't belong.

1471
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:18,600
（當哈利遇上金妮）

1472
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:23,856
邦妮在剛來時，她大概才九歲
Bonnie, was kinda when she arrived,
she was only... 9, maybe.

1473
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:25,190
媽咪，你有看到我的毛衣嗎？
Mommy, have you seen my jumper?

1474
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,859
有，親愛的，貓穿走了
Yes, dear. It was on the cat.

1475
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:29,069
哈囉
Hello.

1476
01:07:29,153 --> 01:07:35,325
我總認為金妮和哈利的關係
有點慢慢發展
I always found Ginny-Harry,
that relationship

1477
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:35,075
how that kind of slowly developed

1478
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:39,496
並和衛斯理一家糾結在一起
and entangling with it
the whole Weasley family

1479
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,666
哈利基本上
也成了衛斯理家族一員
and Harry essentially
becoming a Weasley himself.

1480
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,502
我從沒預期過這種事
It was something I never really
kind of expected

1481
01:07:45,586 --> 01:07:46,920
尤其是讀原著的時候
especially kind of reading the books.

1482
01:07:47,004 --> 01:07:48,881
邦妮年紀最小
Bonnie was the youngest one.

1483
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,300
所以感覺有點怪
So it was just a bit like oh, what?
This is weird.

1484
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,677
閉上眼睛
Close your eyes.

1485
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:56,346
有一種壓力
And you know,
there is kind of pressure.

1486
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,017
{\an5}這是很受鍾愛的故事主角
You know, this is the loved,
sort of, hero of the story.

1487
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,312
片場的人都認識你六、七年了
So, everyone on the set has known you
for about six or seven years

1488
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:04,605
他們都看著你長大
and they watch you grow up.

1489
01:08:04,688 --> 01:08:06,982
然後他們要看你接吻
And they're now gonna just
watch you kiss. Cool, yeah?

1490
01:08:07,065 --> 01:08:08,275
很酷吧

1491
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:19,119
ＪＫ羅琳寫了很多出色的女性角色
I mean, there's so many amazing
female roles that Jo wrote

1492
01:08:19,203 --> 01:08:20,579
我認為這很重要
and I... I think
that's really important.

1493
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:26,168
我很替邦妮驕傲
還有伊凡娜和凱蒂
I'm so proud of who Bonnie
and Evanna and Katie are

1494
01:08:26,251 --> 01:08:27,920
和她們後來變成怎樣的人
and who they've become.

1495
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:31,131
她們都成為很厲害的活動家
They've all become
these incredible activists.

1496
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:36,470
每一個女孩子
都是很可愛很棒的人
Every single one of those girls
was like a lovely, great human being.

1497
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:41,683
{\an5}（史萊哲林交誼廳
霍格華茲魔法與巫術學院）

1498
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,769
我很想念你的陪伴
I tell you I've...
I've missed your company.

1499
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:45,812
－是嗎？謝謝
－這是真的
- Did you? Aw, thank you.
- That's for sure.

1500
01:08:45,896 --> 01:08:47,898
你有拿什麼東西嗎？
因為我偷了很多東西
Did you get anything?
Because I stole quite a lot.

1501
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:49,107
－真的嗎？
－對
- Did you really?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,859
－看吧，我沒學到這點
－我早該告訴你的
No, I didn't.
I should've learned that.

1503
01:08:50,943 --> 01:08:52,069
這樣讓我感覺很安心
- I should've told you.
- Oh, and I'm quite reassured by that

1504
01:08:52,152 --> 01:08:54,988
因為我絕對想偷我的魔杖
because I was definitely trying
to steal my wand.

1505
01:08:55,072 --> 01:08:58,158
我很擔心我要是偷了
我大概就會把魔杖丟在哪裡
- Yeah.
- And I worry that if I had

1506
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:58,158
I probably would've lost it
by now somewhere.

1507
01:08:58,242 --> 01:08:59,785
你知道魔杖沒有用吧，湯姆？
You know, they don't work, Tom.

1508
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:05,165
有人跟我說只要花時間練習…
Well, I've been assured that...

1509
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:05,874
In time, with enough practice...
Practice, it would work.

1510
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:06,542
－就會有用
－對

1511
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:08,502
但現在回首很好笑
Yes. But it's quite funny
looking back at it now.

1512
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:12,047
我們做這些手勢
但卻什麼都沒有
Also doing these incredibly elaborate
moves and nothing happening.

1513
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:14,758
什麼都沒有，我只有一次有結果
And nothing happening. Except
one time it did happen with me.

1514
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:18,136
他們說「我們這次
要炸掉海格的房子」
And they said, "Okay, this time
we are gonna blow up Hagrid's...

1515
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,888
對，你有拍那幕
Oh yeah, you got to do it,
didn't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1516
01:09:19,972 --> 01:09:22,015
他們說「我們讓你下指令」
And they said, "So, we will take
your queue."

1517
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,268
「你施展咒語時
房子就會爆炸」
- Yeah.
- "When you do your spell

1518
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:24,560
it will blow up.

1519
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,189
我對自己的反應非常驚訝
And I was so actually
really surprised

1520
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:32,359
也很害怕，因為我想「天啊」
and scared by my own reaction
because I thought, wow.

1521
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:38,865
－那種力量的快感真可怕
－對
It was this horrible thrill of power.

1522
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:41,201
－你會想，我有那種想法…
－對
- Right.
- Being like, I've had that...

1523
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:43,996
用我的魔杖指東西就會爆炸
- Yeah, sure.
- Just pointing my wand there.

1524
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:44,371
- And then, boom. Yeah.
- And then it blew up.

1525
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,624
對，比讓羽毛漂浮更好玩
It's a lot more satisfying than,
you know, making a feather levitate.

1526
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,042
對
Yeah.

1527
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:54,339
跩哥用那個怪櫃子做什麼？
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird looking cabinet

1528
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:56,049
這些人又是誰？
and who were all those people?

1529
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:58,135
你們看不出來嗎？這是一場儀式
Don't you see, it was a ceremony,
an initiation.

1530
01:09:58,218 --> 01:09:59,511
入會儀式

1531
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,722
別鬧了，哈利
我知道你想說什麼
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going with this.

1532
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:04,057
這是真的，他是他們的一份子
It's happened.
He's one of them.

1533
01:10:04,141 --> 01:10:05,309
他們的成員？
One of what?

1534
01:10:06,685 --> 01:10:09,938
哈利認為跩哥馬份
現在成了食死人
Harry's under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

1535
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:14,276
（跩哥）

1536
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:16,111
這個孩子沒受過關愛
The child
who wasn't received affection

1537
01:10:16,194 --> 01:10:19,156
沒有父母或成人
給予你成長過程需要的關愛
the enabling love of the parent
or the adult

1538
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:22,034
{\an5}可能發展出憤怒
或對世界感到憎恨
can develop this anger
and hatred of the world

1539
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,910
然後進入黑暗面
and goes to the dark side.

1540
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:27,247
－你敢在我家對我這樣說話？
－魯休思
You dare to talk to me like that

1541
01:10:25,746 --> 01:10:27,080
- in my own house.
- Lucius.

1542
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:30,042
跩哥大部分的人生
So much of what Draco's journey is
is to do with whether he is

1543
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,628
取決於他是否想取悅父親
or isn't trying to please his father.

1544
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:35,797
在第六部電影裡
他們讓他做了最糟的事
In the sixth film they make him do
the worst thing ever

1545
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:38,342
殺害鄧不利多
or attempt the worst thing ever
of killing Dumbledore

1546
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:40,469
我們看到他崩潰
and obviously we see him crumble.

1547
01:10:40,552 --> 01:10:44,514
跩哥，好幾年前
我認識一個男孩
Draco, years ago a new a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1548
01:10:44,598 --> 01:10:47,225
他做出所有錯誤的決定

1549
01:10:48,935 --> 01:10:51,438
－請讓我幫你
－我不要你幫忙
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help.

1550
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:54,608
你不懂嗎？
Don't you understand.

1551
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:56,109
我必須這樣做
I have to do this.

1552
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:58,737
我得殺了你
I have to kill you
or he's gonna kill me.

1553
01:10:59,863 --> 01:11:01,156
不然他就會殺了我

1554
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:03,450
湯姆在「混血王子的背叛」裡
最棒的一點是
With Tom what was great
with Half-Blood Prince

1555
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:10,248
這個壞人在前幾部電影裡很普通
was you suddenly took this bad guy

1556
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:09,998
who in the previous films had always
been somewhat two dimensional

1557
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:17,172
然後我們可以給他機會探索
更複雜有趣的旅程
and then we were able to give him
the opportunity

1558
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:17,047
to explore a far more complex
and interesting journey.

1559
01:11:17,255 --> 01:11:18,548
我跟他坐下，我說
And I sat down with him

1560
01:11:18,632 --> 01:11:22,010
「湯姆，這是你
發光發亮的好機會」
and I said, "Tom, look, this is your
opportunity to really shine."

1561
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:24,429
我記得大衛葉慈說
I remember David Yates

1562
01:11:23,387 --> 01:11:27,516
uh, saying, "If we can get
just one percent of empathy

1563
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:28,725
「你要是能對他
有百分之一的同情」

1564
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:29,935
or sympathy for him
that we'll have done our job."

1565
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:30,394
「那我們就成功了」

1566
01:11:30,477 --> 01:11:31,687
下手
Do it.

1567
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:34,314
對我而言，跩哥是主角
To my mind, Draco is the hero.

1568
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:35,941
哈利總是要做正確的事
Harry's always going to do
the right thing.

1569
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:37,150
哈利總想做對選擇
Harry's always gonna make
the right choice.

1570
01:11:37,234 --> 01:11:39,111
他從來沒有遇過困境
There's never really any dilemma
for him.

1571
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:42,739
跩哥則打破了他糟糕家庭的枷鎖
Draco breaks the chains
of his terrible family

1572
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:45,117
打破他的責任
和他該做的事這些枷鎖
and of his responsibility
and what he's expected to do.

1573
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,618
看著湯姆
And to watch Tom
create that struggle on screen

1574
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:51,748
在螢幕上創造出那種掙扎
演出這些細微的差別

1575
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:52,499
and really manifest all that nuance,
all that complication

1576
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:54,376
這些複雜的事
這些很強烈的道德地雷區
all that great ethical minefield
that he tiptoes through

1577
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:57,254
他小心翼翼穿越這個地雷區
很令人佩服

1578
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:57,254
it was... it was just so impressive.

1579
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:59,381
不
No.

1580
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,644
賽佛勒斯
Severus.

1581
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,238
拜託
Please.

1582
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:25,574
啊哇呾喀呾啦
Avada Kedavra.

1583
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:38,754
能回來當然很棒
It's obviously amazing to be back
but I... It's like...

1584
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:43,675
但是可以說很驚嚇

1585
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:46,011
It's so, I guess, like shocking that
so many people that we both thought

1586
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:47,471
很多我們以為會活更久的人

1587
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:47,554
would be around for much longer

1588
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:50,974
然後他們就走了
than they have been like Helen
and Alan and Richard and...

1589
01:12:51,057 --> 01:12:54,436
海倫、艾倫、理查和…

1590
01:12:54,519 --> 01:12:57,606
對，他們跟家人一樣
Yeah. They're like fa... like family.
You can grieve in the same way.

1591
01:12:57,689 --> 01:12:59,983
－我們都很捨不得
－對

1592
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:01,985
- Yeah.
- Just too soon.

1593
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:01,985
一切發生得太快了

1594
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:03,195
對
Yeah.

1595
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:15,582
別可憐死者，哈利
Do not pity the dead, Harry.

1596
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:18,293
可憐生者
Pity the living.

1597
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:23,465
最重要的是，可憐沒有愛的生者
And above all,
all those who live without love.

1598
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:32,265
沉迷於夢中沒有用，哈利
It does not do to dwell on dreams,
Harry, and forget to live.

1599
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,601
或是忘了活下去

1600
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,104
{\an5}（理查哈里斯
生於１９３０年，卒於２００２年）

1601
01:13:38,188 --> 01:13:43,068
{\an5}理查哈里斯是很特別溫暖的人
Richard Harris was such a special,
warm person.

1602
01:13:44,528 --> 01:13:46,363
他真是個閃耀的人
He was so twinkly.

1603
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:52,661
理查很經典
他大概是我認識最搞笑的人
Oh, Richard was classic.

1604
01:13:49,866 --> 01:13:52,702
Probably one of the funniest men
I ever met.

1605
01:13:52,744 --> 01:13:57,707
他是個１１歲的小惡魔
被困在７０多歲男子的身體裡
He was this devilish 11-year-old

1606
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:57,707
trapped in a 70 plus year old
man's body.

1607
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,210
你可以再替我們轉一圈嗎？
Will you give us another twirl,
please?

1608
01:14:02,128 --> 01:14:03,588
他眼裡有一抹光芒
He just had that glint in his eye

1609
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,632
讓他成為完美的鄧不利多
which made him the perfect
Dumbledore, by the way.

1610
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:07,300
他非常搞笑
He was brutally hilarious.

1611
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,637
耳屎
Earwax.

1612
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:15,892
{\an5}理查格里芬斯
是很棒的德思禮先生
Richard Griffiths was just delicious
as, uh, Mr. Dursley.

1613
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:18,728
{\an5}世界上沒有魔法
There's no such thing as magic.

1614
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:25,318
他用氣魄和熱情擁抱他的邪惡
He embraced his wickedness
with such verve and passion.

1615
01:14:25,402 --> 01:14:28,113
他的過世影響我最深
His passing was the one
that has affected me most

1616
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:29,656
因為他很樂於分享知識
because he was generous
with knowledge.

1617
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:31,950
他說「我想跟你分享一切」
He just, like, wanted to share
everything with you.

1618
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:38,373
{\an5}（約翰赫特
生於１９４０年，卒於２０１７年）

1619
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:41,877
{\an5}我總納悶何時會見到你
波特先生
I wondered when I'd be seeing you,
Mr. Potter.

1620
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:47,549
我覺得很幸運能接觸
I feel really lucky to have some,
you know, some little bit of touch

1621
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:49,634
這些已經過世的傳奇人物
with amount of just amazing people
that have passed.

1622
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:54,055
我有一天會變很老，我會說
You know,
I'll be very, very old one day

1623
01:14:54,139 --> 01:14:56,725
「我認識那個傳奇人物」
saying, like,
"I knew that absolute legend."

1624
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,310
我知道我不該在這裡
I... I...
I know ought not to be here.

1625
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,395
{\an5}（海倫麥柯瑞
生於１９６８年，卒於２０２１年）

1626
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:03,481
{\an5}黑魔王本人禁止我談這件事
The Dark Lord himself forbade me
to speak of this.

1627
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,191
海倫麥柯瑞飾演我的妻子
Helen McCrory played my wife.

1628
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:09,446
我說過「我認為我遇上
這輩子見過最厲害的女演員了」
I said, "I think I just met the best
actress I've ever seen in my life."

1629
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:11,698
來
Come.

1630
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:13,909
我覺得跟她共事很幸運
I feel lucky to have worked with her

1631
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:18,830
在片場分享
很多年以來缺少的歡笑
and shared just so much

1632
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,747
frankly, adolescent laughter with her
on the set.

1633
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:22,834
她教了我很多
She had taught me a lot.

1634
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:24,878
看吧，我連話都說不出來
See, I can't even say it.

1635
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:32,427
她有種能力可以…
She had this ability, yeah,
just to sort of, to show such empathy

1636
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:36,640
用雙眼展現同情

1637
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:37,265
in her eyes.

1638
01:15:37,557 --> 01:15:39,392
跟她合作真的很享受
And it was... the was a real treat
to work with her.

1639
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:50,654
{\an5}我能教你迷惑頭腦、誘惑感官
I can teach you how to bewitch
the mind and... and snare the senses.

1640
01:15:50,737 --> 01:15:53,740
艾倫瑞克曼跟我說話時
從不把我當小孩
Alan Rickman never talked to me
like I was a child.

1641
01:15:53,823 --> 01:15:58,662
他總是認真對待我的想法和意見
He always took my thoughts
and opinions very seriously

1642
01:15:58,745 --> 01:16:01,331
我一直很感動
which I was always very touched by.

1643
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:04,042
艾倫生前是我的好朋友
Uh, Alan was a very dear friend
and we had that final scene

1644
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,878
我們一起拍最後一幕
他的最後一幕時

1645
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:06,878
his final scene.

1646
01:16:08,421 --> 01:16:10,256
那會回應你
It answers to you and you only.

1647
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:14,219
只有你

1648
01:16:15,095 --> 01:16:16,596
是嗎？
Does it?

1649
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,140
我那時有點怕他
I was a little intimidated by him,
his precision

1650
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:22,519
他唸台詞的精準專業度

1651
01:16:20,266 --> 01:16:22,519
his expert delivery of lines and...

1652
01:16:22,602 --> 01:16:25,146
我們旗鼓相當得有點搞笑
We sort of went toe to toe,
in a funny way.

1653
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:26,731
石內卜和佛地魔
You know? Snape and Voldemort.

1654
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,818
兩個演員像擊劍一樣享受共演
Two actors can relish, metaphorically
fencing with each other.

1655
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:32,487
艾倫身為演員，像個魔術師一樣
Alan was a magician in that way
as an actor.

1656
01:16:38,034 --> 01:16:40,453
愛我們的人從沒離開過
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1657
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,415
你總能找到他們…
And you can always find them

1658
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:47,335
就在這裡
in here.

記住
But remember this,...
you're not alone.

1661
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:27,208
你並不孤單

接骨木魔杖
The Elder Wand,...
the most powerful wand ever made.

1663
01:17:36,468 --> 01:17:38,887

01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:52,192
這加起來就是死神的聖物
Together they make
the Deathly Hallows.

1667
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:55,987
加起來就是死神的主人
Together they make one
master of death.

1668

活下來的男孩

1673
01:18:28,812 --> 01:18:32,065
他們對家人採取的保護措施…
The measures they had taken
to protect their families

1674
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:35,485
讓他了解
他們比任何人能做的更多
made him realize, more than
anything else could have done

1675
01:18:35,568 --> 01:18:38,238
了解伴隨而來的責任
that they really were going to come
with him

1676
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:41,825
他們確實知道是怎樣的危險
and that they knew exactly
how dangerous that would be.

1677
01:18:41,908 --> 01:18:44,828
他想告訴他們這對他有什麼意義
He wanted to tell them
what that meant to him

1678
01:18:44,911 --> 01:18:48,623
但他就是找不到夠重要的詞語
but he simply could not find words
important enough.

1679
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,879
（第四章，值得爭取的事物）

1680
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:58,383
（哈利波特
死神的聖物Ｉ、ＩＩ）

1681
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:03,555
{\an5}在這裡走動感覺很酷又很怪異
It's both really cool
and it's... it is weird

1682
01:19:01,386 --> 01:19:05,723
like, walking around here
and seeing the sets that we were

1683
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,891
{\an5}看到我們小時候的佈景

1684
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,642
like, kids on, who treated everything

1685
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,852
跟兒時看到時的態度完全一樣
with the amount of respect kids
treat things

1686
01:19:08,935 --> 01:19:11,187
我們在現場玩得很開心

1687
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:11,146
when you're just there
and having fun.

1688
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:13,273
真的，我感受到一股
詭異的懷舊感
It's weird. I'm having like, weird,
nostalgic moments.

1689
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:15,441
記得我的倉鼠嗎？
有人記得我的倉鼠嗎？
Do you remember my hamster?
Does anyone remember my hamster.

1690
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:16,568
－記得
－米莉
- Yes.
- Millie.

1691
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:17,902
我不記得倉鼠的名字，抱歉
Yeah. I didn't remember
the hamster's name, sorry.

1692
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,195
－對
－沒關係
That's okay. That's okay.
Rest in peace, Millie.

1693
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:20,572
沒關係，安息吧，米莉

1694
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,115
我記得你有一隻倉鼠
I remember you having a hamster
and being greatly jealous

1695
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:25,201
我對你在片場有寵物
隱約有點忌妒

1696
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,201
that you had an animal
that was on set with you.

1697
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:27,704
木工部門替倉鼠
做了棺材，對不對？
They made a coffin for it.

1698
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:27,537
- They did, yeah.
- The carpentry department.

1699
01:19:27,787 --> 01:19:31,166
米莉死掉時，佈景設計替米莉
- Did they? Jesus.
- When Millie died the set designers

1700
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:33,793
built Millie her own custom made
wooden coffin

1701
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:33,793
建造了她客製的木棺材

1702
01:19:33,877 --> 01:19:36,421
－裡面有天鵝絨
－很漂亮
- that had velvet on the inside of it.
- It was beautiful.

1703
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:41,759
還有刻牠的名字
因為我當時很難過
And, and it had her name engraved.

1704
01:19:38,798 --> 01:19:39,966
- I mean...
- Because I was...

1705
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:41,759
I mean, I was beside myself.

1706
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,845
我們有辦葬禮嗎？
我覺得我們有致詞過
Did we do like, a service?
I feel like we said a few words.

1707
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:47,098
我一直想抱起死掉的米莉
I kept wanting to pick up dead
Millie.

1708
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,684
撫摸死掉的米莉
And like, stroke and touch dead
Millie.

1709
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:54,731
他說
「艾瑪，米莉得待在棺材裡」
And he was like, "Emma, Millie's
gotta stay in the coffin now."

1710
01:19:54,814 --> 01:19:57,192
我都忘了這些事情
I have forgotten so much of this.

1711
01:19:57,275 --> 01:19:59,944
感覺這是沒多久以前的事
It doesn't feel like much time
has passed.

1712
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,237
我知道
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

1713
01:20:01,321 --> 01:20:02,989
我們現在看起來
還是比電影尾聲好
We all still look better than we do
in the epilogue, which is great.

1714
01:20:03,072 --> 01:20:04,157
－這樣很好
－對

1715
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,575
－像我們在那之前辦到的
－這樣很怪
- Which is a win.
- Like, we've made it in before that.

1716
01:20:08,661 --> 01:20:10,246
－袋子呢？
－有帶
- Bag?
- Yeah.

1717
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,956
毛衣呢？
Jumper.

1718
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,666
我那時額頭超高
- Yeah.
- I was all forehead.

1719
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,210
還穿了肥胖裝
- And the fat suit.
- Yeah.

1720
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:18,046
－對，我很…
－我認為我那時有點…
- I was very... I was... I was...
- I think I kind of...

1721
01:20:18,129 --> 01:20:20,423
你超盡力拍的，你就…
Yeah. You went for it.

1722
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,798
You were like, "Give me the full...

1723
01:20:20,506 --> 01:20:22,050
－給我…
－沒錯，我超盡力拍的
- Give me the suit."
- He went all in.

1724
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:23,468
－對，你那時全力以赴
－對
- Yeah.
- I was so proud of you.

1725
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:24,886
我好替你驕傲

1726
01:20:27,138 --> 01:20:29,265
沒人能真正了解
No one else can really quite
understand what we experienced.

1727
01:20:29,349 --> 01:20:31,601
我們的體驗非常獨特
It was a very unique thing.

1728
01:20:31,684 --> 01:20:34,520
大衛葉慈以前說我們是太空人
I think David Yates
used to describe us as astronauts

1729
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:38,775
因為沒有別人經歷過
這種拍攝規模
because no one else has really
experienced this on this scale

1730
01:20:38,858 --> 01:20:41,277
我們會因此永遠聯繫在一起
and we'll be kind of forever bonded
by that.

1731
01:20:46,574 --> 01:20:48,368
我對我們三個最甜蜜的回憶
Some of the sweetest memories I have
from the three of us

1732
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:50,954
就是我們都知道，我們必須…
is just each of us knowing we sort of
needed to take care of each other

1733
01:20:51,037 --> 01:20:53,414
用細微的方式照顧彼此

1734
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:53,665
in just small ways.

1735
01:20:53,498 --> 01:20:57,210
比如說「天氣很冷
我們都要…」
Just in terms of like,
it's really cold.

1736
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:58,503
Like, we're all gonna st...
We're all gonna stand together.

1737
01:20:57,293 --> 01:20:58,670
「我們要站在一起」

1738
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,421
或者「我累了」
Or, "I'm knackered.

1739
01:21:00,505 --> 01:21:03,383
「丹，我可以靠你身上睡嗎？」
Are you okay, Dan,
if I like, fall asleep on you

1740
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:06,970
在這兩個鏡頭之間
因為我太累或…
like, in between this take
because I'm so tired?" Or...

1741
01:21:07,053 --> 01:21:11,015
我認為我們都在各種狀況下
靠在彼此身上睡著過
I think we have all fallen asleep
in various

1742
01:21:09,555 --> 01:21:12,642
like, on, on each other in, like,
some of the most grand cathedrals

1743
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,518
在英國幾座最宏偉的大教堂裡

1744
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:14,310
and things in the UK.

1745
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:17,605
我的信任程度…
The level of trust that I had

1746
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:20,275
我們這十年建立的信任
and that we did build
over those 10 years

1747
01:21:20,358 --> 01:21:23,194
我們要是做特技
was like, if we were doing a stunt

1748
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,029
I trusted that one of you
would catch me.

1749
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,029
我信任你們會接住我

1750
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,240
我認為這種信任和依靠
I feel like that kind of trust
and reliance

1751
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:28,908
這需要…
and that takes... You know,
there's very few work environments

1752
01:21:28,992 --> 01:21:32,078
很少有工作環境
可以讓人建立這種信任程度

1753
01:21:30,576 --> 01:21:31,786
where you get that much time
to build that up.

1754
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,454
而且這些事都不用說出口
And it was like, nonverbal.

1755
01:21:33,538 --> 01:21:37,875
我們三個好像不用說話就能溝通
Like, it was all...
It was like the three of us

1756
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,875
could communicate
without even having to say anything.

1757
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:39,419
我們就是知道該做的就要做
We just knew what needed to be done.

1758
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:42,964
我們替彼此保持堅強
We were each very strong
for each other.

1759
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:45,800
我們得換衣服
I need to change.

1760
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:53,641
怎麼…
How the ruddy?

1761
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:55,560
無形伸展咒
Undetectable extension charm.

1762
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,396
你真厲害，真的
You're amazing. You are.

1763
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:01,441
你總是那麼驚訝
Always the tone of surprise.

1764
01:22:01,524 --> 01:22:03,985
這幾部電影的氛圍很不一樣
These films
had a very different feel.

1765
01:22:04,068 --> 01:22:06,404
我們常常不在霍格華茲
We were away from Hogwarts
a lot of the time

1766
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:08,364
我們會在不同的地方過夜
camping out in different places.

1767
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:12,243
氣氛黑暗多了
感覺像不同的電影
Tone was a lot darker,
and it felt like a different film.

1768
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,412
鄧不利多派你去找這些分靈體
Dumbledore sends you off
to find all these Horcruxes

1769
01:22:14,495 --> 01:22:16,164
但他沒叫你摧毀它們
but doesn't tell you
how to destroy them?

1770
01:22:16,247 --> 01:22:18,791
我認為感覺很不一樣
It was very refreshing

1771
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,169
I think, because we all got to do
some a lot more serious stuff

1772
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,294
因為我們都能拍更嚴肅的主題

1773
01:22:21,377 --> 01:22:24,547
有機會更深入
這些角色現實的一面
and it was a real opportunity
to go deeper with these characters.

1774
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,257
你是要來，還是要留下來？
Are you coming, are you staying?

1775
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,472
我那天晚上看到你們兩個
I saw you two the other night.

1776
01:22:33,389 --> 01:22:35,308
榮恩，那…沒什麼
Ron, that's, that's nothing.

1777
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,145
榮恩
Ron.

1778
01:22:40,104 --> 01:22:42,273
我以為會很尷尬的那一幕
The scene that I thought
was gonna be really awkward

1779
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:43,858
我對那一幕很不確定
and I wasn't sure about at all,
which was us doing our dance.

1780
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:45,860
那就是我們跳舞那一幕

1781
01:22:45,943 --> 01:22:47,320
－我就…
－對
- Like, I...
- Yeah.

1782
01:22:47,403 --> 01:22:51,115
現在那算我
在整個系列最愛的一幕
Now, that's one of my favorite scenes
from the whole of the series.

1783
01:22:51,574 --> 01:22:55,661
因為我們在那時候
彼此熟悉的程度
Because the level of familiarity

1784
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:55,411
that you and I had with each other
at that point

1785
01:22:55,745 --> 01:22:58,289
我應該沒辦法
跟另一個演員那樣演
I don't think I could've done a scene
like that with another actor.

1786
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,916
那一幕很有趣的另一個原因
Well, it's also an interesting scene

1787
01:22:59,999 --> 01:23:01,584
因為首先
我們拍的是「哈利波特」
because first of all,
we were doing Harry Potter films

1788
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:03,753
然後在最後一部電影
導演過來說
and then on the last movie,
the director came in

1789
01:23:03,836 --> 01:23:06,714
「你們聽尼克凱夫的音樂
跳慢舞怎樣？」
and was like, "Hey, how about you do
slow dancing

1790
01:23:05,129 --> 01:23:06,714
to Nick Cave for five minutes?"

1791
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:08,716
－你說「我們在拍什麼電影？」
－我們說「什麼？」
- Wait, what?
- "Wait, what movie are we working on?

1792
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,218
「好吧」
Like, great, but okay."

1793
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:37,537
那一幕描述了很多
不言而喻，我很愛那一幕
There's so much unsaid in the scene
that was unspoken.

1794
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,955
I loved that.
And also, in the same way

1795
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:41,374
同時，這些角色
得以享受片刻的樂趣

1796
01:23:39,038 --> 01:23:41,165
that for the characters,
they got to have a moment of fun

1797
01:23:41,457 --> 01:23:43,084
我認為你和我享受了片刻的樂趣
I feel like you and I
got to have a moment of fun.

1798
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:45,086
－對
－我們也…
- Yeah. Certainly.
- Which we also...

1799
01:23:45,169 --> 01:23:47,338
－在那時候需要樂趣
－對，沒錯
Needed at that point.
Yes. Absolutely.

1800
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:49,549
那個奸詐的小混帳
Treacherous little bleeder.

1801
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,008
我們誰都不能信任嗎？
Is there no one we can trust?

1802
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:54,679
最後一部電影
有一段是我們跑步穿越樹林
There was that like,
that sequence in the last movie

1803
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,637
where it was like,
us running through the forest.

1804
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:57,849
我們跑越樹林
不想被死拿錢抓住
We were racing through the woods

1805
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:57,723
trying not to be caught
by the snatchers.

1806
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:59,142
開拍
And action.

1807
01:24:01,018 --> 01:24:02,311
別呆站著
Well, don't hang about.

1808
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:03,813
抓住他們
Snatch them.

1809
01:24:03,896 --> 01:24:05,648
老實說，我記得你和我…
Honestly, I remember
you and I, Emma

1810
01:24:05,731 --> 01:24:07,400
艾瑪變得很想贏
- becoming incredibly competitive...
- Ridiculously competitive, yeah.

1811
01:24:07,483 --> 01:24:10,111
－超想贏的
－看誰跑得比較快
...about who was gonna run faster.

1812
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,197
- High five. That rocked.
- And cut.

1813
01:24:13,406 --> 01:24:15,032
我覺得魯伯特總是有點…
I feel like Rupert was always like,
a little bit too...

1814
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:17,910
－「你們想做什麼就做吧」
－他總是「你們想做就做」
- Whatever.
- ..."You guys do what you like."
Rupert's just like,
"You do your thing."

1815
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:20,455
對，對我而言，跑步就是特技
- Yeah. For me, running is a stunt.
- I'll be here.

1816
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:22,707
走路是…
Walking is a stunt.

1817
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:28,546
Harry.

1818
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:32,425
我很不喜歡看我自己演的戲
I absolutely do not like watching

1819
01:24:31,257 --> 01:24:32,467
very many scenes
with myself in there

1820
01:24:32,508 --> 01:24:34,427
但我看了你們兩個
我覺得你們很棒
but I've watched you two,
and I think you're brilliant.

1821
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:36,345
我覺得那很棒
I remember
that was a really sweet thing though.

1822
01:24:36,429 --> 01:24:38,931
我記得我們三個告訴彼此
I do actually remember
the three of us telling each other

1823
01:24:39,015 --> 01:24:41,350
說我們演得很好
或說我們哪一幕演得很好
that we were doing a good job,
or that we'd done a scene well.

1824
01:24:41,434 --> 01:24:43,102
尤其因為我們那麼小就開始演
Especially because
we had started off young

1825
01:24:43,186 --> 01:24:44,562
我們不清楚自己在做什麼
and really not known
what we were doing.

1826
01:24:44,645 --> 01:24:47,398
我們看到彼此演得很用力
你就會說…
So that when we would see each other
do like, a bit of real acting

1827
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,317
－「做得好」
－「那很酷」
- you'd go, "Oh, cool."
- Oh, that was right.
That was cool. That was really good.

1828
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,194
像是「我們大概越演越厲害」
- Yeah. Crushed it.
- I guess we're all getting better.

1829
01:24:51,277 --> 01:24:52,862
－「演得好」
－「做得好」
- Yeah, great. Well done.
- Right.

1830
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:55,615
當然了，我們接吻的戲
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean, obviously us kissing

1831
01:24:55,990 --> 01:25:01,996
那是我們之間做過最可怕的事
- Oh, yeah.
- was the most horrifying thing

1832
01:24:58,534 --> 01:24:59,702
either of us

1833
01:24:59,785 --> 01:25:02,079
- Yeah.
- have ever had to go through.

1834
01:25:03,623 --> 01:25:06,834
（預期）

1835
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:08,503
我是妙麗格蘭傑
I'm Hermione Granger. And you are?

1836
01:25:08,586 --> 01:25:10,379
你是…

1837
01:25:11,255 --> 01:25:13,674
－我是榮恩衛斯理
－幸會
- Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

1838
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:18,304
「是啦唯啊薩，不是啦唯喔薩」
It's Leviosa, not Leviosa.

1839
01:25:18,387 --> 01:25:22,683
她真討厭，難怪她沒有朋友
She's a nightmare. Honestly.

1840
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:22,683
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

1841
01:25:24,644 --> 01:25:25,853
她聽到你說的話了
I think she heard you.

1842
01:25:25,937 --> 01:25:28,314
整個系列越累積越多…
It was just built up so much
for the whole series.

1843
01:25:28,397 --> 01:25:29,482
－八部電影
－對
The eight films.

1844
01:25:29,565 --> 01:25:31,442
{\an5}我很愛榮恩和妙麗的愛情
I love Ron and Hermione's romance

1845
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:35,613
不停在故事底下醞釀
and the way that sort of just bubbles
away under the story constantly.

1846
01:25:42,912 --> 01:25:46,374
他們的關係壓抑了這麼久
This relationship has been
so restrained for so long.

1847
01:25:46,457 --> 01:25:48,292
一點牙膏
Got a bit of toothpaste.

1848
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:51,963
史拉轟要辦聖誕派對
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

1849
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,423
我們要攜伴去參加
And we're meant to bring someone.

1850
01:25:54,507 --> 01:25:55,841
你大概會帶麥拉去
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.

1851
01:25:55,925 --> 01:25:59,345
觀眾很想看他們接吻
The audience

1852
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,303
are desperate to see these two kiss.

1853
01:25:59,428 --> 01:26:02,056
－事實上，我想邀你
－真的嗎？
Actually, I was going to ask you.

1854
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,223
Really?

1855
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:04,350
我們本週稍後要拍一幕
There's a scene
that we shoot next this week

1856
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:06,143
等你們讀過之後，我們該談談
that we should talk about
once you've read it

1857
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,312
因為這個禮拜
榮恩和妙麗要接吻
because we'll be doing the kiss
this week between Ron and Hermione.

1858
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,690
－什麼？
－榮恩和妙麗要接吻
- What?
- Doing the kiss between

1859
01:26:10,773 --> 01:26:12,984
－這個禮拜？
－在密室裡
- Ron and Hermione this week
- This week?
- This week?
- in the Chamber of Secrets.

1860
01:26:14,026 --> 01:26:16,821
在這異常危險的時刻
In this moment
of extraordinary jeopardy

1861
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:19,991
他們轉向彼此，然後他們接吻了
they turn to each other,
and then they just kiss.

1862
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:26,163
我們等了七部電影才等到這一幕
We've waited seven movies for this.

1863
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,790
我跟他們在個別的拖車裡談過
I spoke to both of them
in their trailers.

1864
01:26:28,332 --> 01:26:30,626
確保他們都可以接受
Made sure they were both comfortable.

1865
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:33,337
那很像替他們準備
參與大型運動賽事
It was almost like prepping them
for a major sport event.

1866
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:37,925
「你們可以的，這會很棒的」
You know, saying,
"Okay, guys, you can do this.

1867
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:37,592
It's gonna be great."

1868
01:26:38,009 --> 01:26:40,928
那場吻戲應該是
很戲劇性的一個吻
It was meant to be, like, this,
like, dramatic make out

1869
01:26:41,012 --> 01:26:43,889
因為我們很尷尬，一直笑
because you and I just kept corpsing.

1870
01:26:42,471 --> 01:26:43,848
Like, we just kept laughing.

1871
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:45,182
－對
－我很怕
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I was just really scared

1872
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,977
我們一直拍不好
因為我們很不正經
we were never gonna get it because

1873
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:47,560
- We couldn't take it seriously.
- we just couldn't take it seriously.

1874
01:26:49,395 --> 01:26:52,481
我並沒有幫忙，因為他們跟我說
I did not make this better
because I've been told significantly

1875
01:26:52,565 --> 01:26:54,692
我在這場戲像個混帳一樣
that I was just being
an absolute dick about this

1876
01:26:54,775 --> 01:26:57,361
我想「我要來現場看你們接吻」
and was like, "I'm gonna come on set
and watch you guys kiss."

1877
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:00,364
大家都想來現場，因為大家都說
- And like...
- Well, everyone wanted to be on set

1878
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,699
because everyone was like,
"This is gonna be good, guys."

1879
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:01,657
「這會很精彩的，各位」

1880
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:03,743
－像我們得…
－很抱歉，兩位
- Like, we need...
- I'm sorry about that, guys.

1881
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:08,080
我知道我會是讓接吻戲成功的人
- Yeah, yeah.
- I knew I was gonna kind of have

1882
01:27:06,078 --> 01:27:07,872
to be the one to kind
of make this thing happen

1883
01:27:08,164 --> 01:27:09,999
因為魯伯特不會…
because Rupert was not gonna.

1884
01:27:10,082 --> 01:27:12,043
所以我得放手去做
So I just had to go for it.

1885
01:27:12,418 --> 01:27:13,836
不擇手段
Taking no prisoners.

1886
01:27:13,919 --> 01:27:17,173
我需要有動力接吻才辦得到
I needed, like, momentum
into the kiss in order to do it.

1887
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,758
而魯伯特…
And Rupert's, I could...
Almost on that first take

1888
01:27:18,841 --> 01:27:22,345
我差點…第一次拍時
我看到魯伯特的臉

1889
01:27:20,509 --> 01:27:24,221
I saw Rupert's face
explode with surprise

1890
01:27:22,428 --> 01:27:26,223
非常驚訝，因為那才是第一次拍

1891
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:26,223
because he thought,
it's only the first take.

1892
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,808
我那時好像有點快昏倒了
Kind of think I blacked out.

1893
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:30,728
我只記得你的臉越來越靠近
- You blacked out.
- I just remember your face

1894
01:27:28,934 --> 01:27:30,353
getting closer and closer to my...

1895
01:27:31,354 --> 01:27:35,941
你每次提到這幕
都說得好像是恐怖回憶
Every time you talk about this

1896
01:27:32,855 --> 01:27:35,608
you make it sound like an
actual horror show in your head.

1897
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:38,444
並沒那麼糟，我知道
- No, but it wasn't that bad. I know.
- Which is...

1898
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:54,251
親魯伯特是我做過
最困難的事之一
Kissing Rupert is one of the hardest
things I've ever had to do.

1899
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,213
感覺很不對勁
It just felt wrong,
so wrong on every level

1900
01:27:57,296 --> 01:27:59,131
感覺非常不對

1901
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:01,842
因為丹、魯伯特和我像兄弟姐妹
because Dan, Rupert and I
are so much siblings.

1902
01:28:04,887 --> 01:28:06,055
你還好嗎？
See you later.

1903
01:28:06,138 --> 01:28:07,223
哈利
- Harry.
- All three of us, I think

1904
01:28:07,306 --> 01:28:10,810
我們三個都覺得
這對我們意義一樣重大
felt so matched in how much
it meant to us.

1905
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:16,857
我記得那一幕
你說「不，我得自己去」
I remember the scene
when you were like

1906
01:28:14,939 --> 01:28:16,774
"No guys. I'm the one
who has to go on my own

1907
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:18,442
在這一部片裡
kind of thing, on this,
this one."

1908
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,569
我擁抱你道別
And I gave you the hug
to say goodbye.

1909
01:28:20,653 --> 01:28:22,780
－我跟你去
－不，殺死蛇
- I'll go with you.
- No. Kill the snake.

1910
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:28,661
我知道我要對這系列道別
I knew I was saying goodbye
to the series.

1911
01:28:28,744 --> 01:28:31,372
我知道我在對你道別
I knew I was saying goodbye
to you.

1912
01:28:31,455 --> 01:28:36,085
我只得把我真正的感受演出來
And I just had to just bring
to the surface

1913
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,127
how I really felt about it all

1914
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,046
－即將結束
－對
- coming to an end.
- Yeah.

1915
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:48,472
（最後一戰）

1916
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,645
把哈利帶過橋的那一幕
很像聖經場景
It's a very biblical image
carrying Harry across the bridge.

1917
01:28:57,857 --> 01:29:01,110
你要是問ＪＫ羅琳
或任何深入參與的人
If you ask Jo, or anyone
who's deeply involved in it

1918
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:03,571
他們只會說這是善惡之戰
they'll just say it's the battle
between good and evil.

1919
01:29:03,654 --> 01:29:05,239
就這麼簡單
It's as simple as that.

1920
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:10,786
我欠奈威這個角色良多
I owe so much to Neville
as a character.

1921
01:29:12,037 --> 01:29:14,331
我那時非常害羞
我在班上都不說話
I was very, very shy, and
I wouldn't never speak up in class.

1922
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:15,916
我都不會舉手
I wouldn't put my hand up
for anything

1923
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,627
因為我跟這個角色完全一個樣
because I very much was him.

1924
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:23,382
{\an5}奈威最棒的故事就是他是個冠軍
Great story of Neville
is that he's the champion.

1925
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:27,803
在最後那段精彩的一幕
That wonderful bit at the end.
That great speech of Matty's.

1926
01:29:27,887 --> 01:29:29,805
馬修的精彩演講

1927
01:29:29,013 --> 01:29:30,055
You know...

1928
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,184
{\an5}當然了，善者必須贏
Good must prevail. Of course.

1929
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:34,435
{\an5}（羅比寇特蘭，飾魯霸海格）

1930
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:37,104
－哈利不在了並不重要
－退下，奈威
- Doesn't matter that Harry's gone.
- Stand down, Neville.

1931
01:29:37,188 --> 01:29:38,731
天天都有人死
People die every day.

1932
01:29:39,857 --> 01:29:41,275
我們今晚失去了哈利
We lost Harry tonight.

1933
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:46,989
但他還跟我們在一起，就在這裡
He's still with us.

1934
01:29:45,988 --> 01:29:47,031
In here.

1935
01:29:50,576 --> 01:29:51,869
他們沒有白死
He didn't die in vain.

1936
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:53,662
但「哈利波特」替我做的
But the thing that Harry Potter
did for me

1937
01:29:53,746 --> 01:29:56,582
不管是故事
或是我身為片中的演員
both as a story,
and as an actor in it...

1938
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:58,542
但是你會的
- But you will.
- ...was that it helped me

1939
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:01,378
幫我找到一開始
並不屬於我的身份
to find at first what I'm not.

1940
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:03,088
哈利的心為我們而跳
Harry's heart did beat for us.

1941
01:30:03,172 --> 01:30:04,298
替我們所有人而跳
For all of us.

1942
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,551
因此我才能找到找到我自己
Which therefore by extension
found what I am.

1943
01:30:10,429 --> 01:30:11,639
爆爆炸
Confringo.

1944
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,236
看原著的時候
佛地魔和哈利最後的對決
When looking at the book

1945
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:25,110
the final confrontation
between Voldemort and Harry

1946
01:30:25,945 --> 01:30:29,031
在餐廳裡發生，很多人在看
takes place in the great hall
with a huge audience watching.

1947
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:32,785
我很想拍更樸實緊湊的戲
And I really wanted
something earthier

1948
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:34,537
and more intense
and more visceral than that.

1949
01:30:32,868 --> 01:30:34,745
更血腥的戲

1950
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:38,958
因為這兩個死敵
Because these two adversaries
were almost joined spiritually

1951
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:43,671
差點像怪異的分靈體那樣
在精神上結合

1952
01:30:40,417 --> 01:30:43,629
if you like, in this strange,
Horcruxy way

1953
01:30:43,754 --> 01:30:48,092
我認為丹要是能抓住羅夫
把他拉下這座塔
I thought, "Wouldn't it be wonderful
if Dan just grabbed Ralph

1954
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:49,969
豈不是很棒？
and pulled him off this tower?"

1955
01:30:50,052 --> 01:30:53,055
快點，湯姆，了結一切吧
Come on, Tom. Let's finish this
the way we started it.

1956
01:30:53,973 --> 01:30:55,182
一起了結
Together.

1957
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:57,685
他們分開時，他們結合在一起
As they apparate,
they merge together.

1958
01:30:57,768 --> 01:31:02,857
我們在故事和電影裡
所描述的深層聯繫
That deep connection
that we'd sort of threaded

1959
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:02,815
through the stories and films

1960
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,277
在他們跌下去前
你會看到這一刻
you'd visualize in that moment before
they tumble down into the courtyard.

1961
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:12,783
我覺得非常累
I remember
being quite physically tired.

1962
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:15,536
{\an5}我們把一切投入其中
在最後變得很累
We put everything into it.
We were exhausted, I think,
at the end.

1963
01:31:15,619 --> 01:31:18,497
我們在寒冷的月分拍攝
天空是灰色的
We were shooting in cold months
and the skies were gray.

1964
01:31:18,581 --> 01:31:20,165
我的前臂變得很緊繃
My forearm got so tight

1965
01:31:20,249 --> 01:31:23,335
因為你在施法，你得…
because this thing
that's running current in you

1966
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:23,127
that you had to...

1967
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:26,046
對他推過去
push it back at him.

1968
01:31:27,047 --> 01:31:30,342
拍攝這些電影的體能挑戰
As well as the physical challenge
of making the films

1969
01:31:30,426 --> 01:31:32,636
還有一點思考的小壓力
there was that small pressure
of thinking

1970
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,388
你會是完成這系列的人
you're the one
who's gonna finish this.

1971
01:31:34,597 --> 01:31:37,725
一定要有很棒的結尾
一定要很有意義
It has to go out on a high.
It has to be meaningful.

1972
01:31:37,808 --> 01:31:40,644
一定要引起共鳴，要讓人滿意
It has to resonate.
It has to deliver.

1973
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:30,027
（新的開始）

1974
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:31,987
你是誰？
Who are you?

1975
01:32:32,071 --> 01:32:34,949
我叫艾瑪華生
我飾演妙麗格蘭傑這個角色
Hello.
My name is Emma Watson

1976
01:32:33,405 --> 01:32:34,823
playing the part of Hermione Granger.

1977
01:32:35,866 --> 01:32:37,993
－不要
－我不想被人看到我這樣
I've gone all shy.
- No, never.
- I'd rather be never seen like this.

1978
01:32:38,077 --> 01:32:39,703
－什麼？
－算了
- What?
- Never mind.

1979
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:40,996
不想被人看到這樣？
- Rather not be seen like this? Why?
- Yeah.

1980
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,331
－對
－為什麼？

1981
01:32:42,414 --> 01:32:44,166
因為他不喜歡頭髮上有髮夾
Because he doesn't like
the clip in his hair.

1982
01:32:44,249 --> 01:32:45,668
－對
－雷德克里夫先生
- Yeah.
- It's a rad clip.

1983
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:47,086
對
Yep.

1984
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,963
是攝影機
Camera off.

1985
01:32:49,046 --> 01:32:50,631
－你怎麼…
－你是媒體
- What did the cam...
- You're from the press.

1986
01:32:50,714 --> 01:32:52,800
我是媒體，沒錯，你怎麼知道？
I'm from the press, exactly.
How did he know?

1987
01:32:52,883 --> 01:32:54,760
今天是你第一天開拍
感覺怎樣？
It's your first day.
How does it feel?

1988
01:32:54,843 --> 01:32:57,054
感覺非常棒
It feels absolutely fantastic.

1989
01:32:57,137 --> 01:32:59,765
－你很期待嗎？
－很期待
Are you excited?

1990
01:32:58,305 --> 01:32:59,431
Very much so.

1991
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:01,433
我等不及了
- Yes.
- I can't wait.

1992
01:33:01,517 --> 01:33:03,143
在這些準備之後
After all this preparation.

1993
01:33:03,686 --> 01:33:04,770
終於要發生了
Finally happening.
Okay, get back to work.

1994
01:33:04,853 --> 01:33:07,272
回去工作，大家需要替你準備

1995
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,231
People need to pamper you.

1996
01:33:07,356 --> 01:33:08,691
對
- Yep.
- Hey hey.

1997
01:33:13,612 --> 01:33:16,824
魯伯特，你回想過去時
你現在感覺怎樣？
What do you think about
when you think about it now, Rupert?

1998
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,199
Like, as you look back on.
Like, for me

1999
01:33:16,907 --> 01:33:19,201
對我而言，那是很美好的回憶
你呢？
- it's very good memories.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

2000
01:33:19,284 --> 01:33:20,744
我很驕傲是這些電影的一份子
- Like, what is it for you?
- I'm very proud
to have been part of them.

2001
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:22,579
我認為到最後
I think towards the end,
it was kind of a weird time.

2002
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:25,332
那時候有點怪異，尤其是結束時

2003
01:33:23,706 --> 01:33:25,332
- Yeah.
- Especially kind of finishing.

2004
01:33:25,749 --> 01:33:29,586
我覺得我忘了自己是誰
還有那個角色是誰
I feel like I lost track
of who I was

2005
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,256
我不知道從哪裡結束或開始
and who the character was,
didn't really know
where they ended or began.

2006
01:33:32,339 --> 01:33:34,758
讓我開始自問「我是誰？」
Yeah. There were some things
that I'm just like

2007
01:33:33,716 --> 01:33:35,843
"Who, who am I?
Like, What do I like to do?

2008
01:33:34,842 --> 01:33:37,136
「我喜歡做什麼？
這對我有什麼重要性？」

2009
01:33:35,926 --> 01:33:37,094
What, what is important to me?"

2010
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:39,722
那很怪異
連我的名字都不像我的名字
- Like, it's weird things.
- Yeah.

2011
01:33:38,303 --> 01:33:39,888
Even my name
didn't feel like my name.

2012
01:33:39,805 --> 01:33:42,307
－對
－我只知道怎麼做一件事
- Yeah.
- I felt I really only knew

2013
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:43,809
－對
－我只知道怎麼飾演榮恩
how to do one thing.
- Yeah.
- I knew how to play Ron.

2014
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:45,019
榮恩是我最愛的角色
Ron was my favorite character

2015
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:47,479
能在電影裡飾演這個角色
真的很酷
so it was so cool
being him in the film.

2016
01:33:47,938 --> 01:33:51,775
根本像我們用最極端的方法演戲
It's almost like we did
the most extreme form

2017
01:33:50,524 --> 01:33:51,734
of method acting.

2018
01:33:52,985 --> 01:33:54,903
總得在某個時候結束
It always had to end at some point.

2019
01:33:54,987 --> 01:33:57,823
我們不可能永遠拍下去
We were never gonna be doing this...

2020
01:33:57,072 --> 01:33:58,115
forever.

2021
01:33:58,657 --> 01:34:01,702
對現在的我來說，看到你在這裡
The way it feels for me now

2022
01:34:00,242 --> 01:34:03,245
like, seeing you here,
having had time apart...

2023
01:34:01,785 --> 01:34:03,620
我們分隔了一段時間

2024
01:34:04,621 --> 01:34:06,373
我想盡量不要太感傷
I'm trying not to get emotional.

2025
01:34:06,457 --> 01:34:09,001
感覺像你是我人生中的支柱
It feels like you're like
a pillar of my life.

2026
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:11,628
好窩心，因為我看著你長大
It's a very overwhelming thing,
because I've watched you grow up.

2027
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,547
我們看著彼此長大
我們是一起長大的
We've watched each other grow up.
We grew up together. We're family.

2028
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:14,840
我們是一家人

2029
01:34:15,799 --> 01:34:18,677
我們會永遠是一家人
我們不用見彼此…天啊
We always will be.
We don't need to see each other.

2030
01:34:17,468 --> 01:34:18,635
Oh, my God.

2031
01:34:19,219 --> 01:34:22,431
即使我們不常見到彼此
Even though we don't see each other
all the time...

2032
01:34:23,474 --> 01:34:25,100
對，這…
Yeah, it's a...

2033
01:34:26,643 --> 01:34:29,480
我們永遠會有很緊密的羈絆
it's a strong...

2034
01:34:27,853 --> 01:34:29,438
a strong bond that we'll always have

2035
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:32,566
而我們總會是彼此人生的一份子
and we will always be part
of each other's life.

2036
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:47,247
－很高興看到你
－看到你真好
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

2037
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,292
我愛你
I love you.

2038
01:34:56,423 --> 01:34:57,508
是朋友那種愛
As a friend.

2039
01:35:00,594 --> 01:35:03,555
－讓觀賞的大家搞清楚
－說清楚
Just to be clear

2040
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:02,930
- for everyone watching.
- Just to be clear.

2041
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:06,850
但這是真的，我們有好多愛
But it's true.

2042
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:06,767
There's so much love.

2043
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:08,352
謝了，魯伯特
Thanks, Rupes.

2044
01:35:08,435 --> 01:35:11,271
今天還是排練，回放和…
So let's just do a rehearsal,
and let's just wade back in.

2045
01:35:10,854 --> 01:35:12,314
Just wade back into the plot.

2046
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:14,149
等準備好就開演
When you're ready. And action.

2047
01:35:16,026 --> 01:35:18,320
我們在最後那幾幕都很投入
When we were all wrapping up
those final scenes

2048
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:23,033
我們在整個拍片過程
拍的最後幾幕
one of the last shots we did
in the entire shoot...

2049
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:25,577
我們都跳過攝影機
We were diving past the camera,
and landing on this huge crash mat.

2050
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:28,622
掉在防護墊上

2051
01:35:28,705 --> 01:35:30,541
那就是最後一幕
That was what it all came down to

2052
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,210
這一個鏡頭是我們跳進煙囪
this one take of us
jumping in a chimney.

2053
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:36,922
這是對事實的比喻
It was such a metaphor
for what was actually happening.

2054
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:41,593
我們得跳上墊子到另一個世界去
We had to, like, jump onto a mat,
basically

2055
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,677
to travel into another world.

2056
01:35:42,845 --> 01:35:46,306
大家的情緒都很強烈
The collective emotion
was incredibly palpable.

2057
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:50,060
對於支持他們
和持續挺他們的人而言
And for the people
who'd supported them

2058
01:35:48,183 --> 01:35:50,060
and had been there for them
throughout.

2059
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:53,230
看他們長大的所有人
Everybody who'd seen them grow up.

2060
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:56,859
All right then.

2061
01:35:57,609 --> 01:35:59,611
在最後一天，我非常難過
On that last day, I just lost it.

2062
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:04,992
我記得我們都抱著彼此
I remember all of us
just holding each other.

2063
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,496
我們三個都…
All three of us were like...

2064
01:36:10,205 --> 01:36:11,248
非常難過
utterly devastated.

2065
01:36:14,084 --> 01:36:19,423
我認為那是我們第一次
讓自己面對甚至是感受到…
I think it was the first time
we allowed ourselves

2066
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:20,674
to even process
or realize we'd done it.

2067
01:36:19,506 --> 01:36:22,426
我們辦到了，我們做到了

2068
01:36:20,924 --> 01:36:22,176
We'd made it through.

2069
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:27,347
這也在我內心深處
我用這些電影來衡量我的生活
It's so ingrained in me as well.

2070
01:36:24,428 --> 01:36:26,889
Like, I measure my life
with these movies.

2071
01:36:27,431 --> 01:36:29,641
有人問「你何時考到駕照的？」
Someone says, like, "Oh, when did
you pass your driving test?"

2072
01:36:29,725 --> 01:36:31,852
我說「拍鳳凰會的密令的時候」
I'm like, "Order of the Phoenix."

2073
01:36:32,561 --> 01:36:36,648
我人生的每個部分
都跟「哈利波特」有關
Every part of my life
is connected to Potter.

2074
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:42,237
我認識很多人
這系列對他們意義重大
When I meet people who, it's a really
important part of their life

2075
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:44,281
也認識書籍或電影
對他們意義重大的人
or the books or the films
were in some way, like

2076
01:36:44,364 --> 01:36:46,491
這系列像是他們身份的一部分
a part of their identity, it...

2077
01:36:46,575 --> 01:36:48,577
對，這讓你很驕傲
Yeah, it just makes you really proud.

2078
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:52,289
「哈利波特」讓人生更豐富
There's something about Harry Potter
that makes life richer.

2079
01:36:52,372 --> 01:36:55,792
當事情變黑暗，日子變很困難時
Like, when things get really dark
and times are really hard

2080
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:58,420
我們可以進入這個故事中
stories give us places we can go
where we can rest and feel held.

2081
01:36:58,503 --> 01:37:00,297
讓我們得以休息

2082
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,591
感覺有人在支持著你

2083
01:37:02,674 --> 01:37:04,635
我那時候應該不了解
I don't think I fully appreciated
the reach that these films had

2084
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:06,762
我們拍過的那些電影有這種影響

2085
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:08,513
很多人說過…
when we were in them.
The amount of people
that have said things like

2086
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:10,933
「這是我爸爸和我
唯一一起看過的電影」
"These are the only films
my dad and I watched together.

2087
01:37:11,016 --> 01:37:12,392
「我們都不聊其他的事情」
Like, we can't talk about
anything else

2088
01:37:12,476 --> 01:37:14,686
「我們一起看哈利波特
這是我們一起做的事」
and like,
we watch Harry Potter together.

2089
01:37:13,602 --> 01:37:14,645
That's been our thing."

2090
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:18,065
能帶來這種影響真棒
It's amazing
to be a small kind of part of that.

2091
01:37:18,148 --> 01:37:20,484
看著這系列繼續存在
And just seeing it
kind of re-live on.

2092
01:37:20,567 --> 01:37:21,693
找到新的媒體
Finding new mediums

2093
01:37:21,777 --> 01:37:24,071
像是舞台戲、「怪獸」系列
like the stage show,
Fantastic Beasts.

2094
01:37:24,154 --> 01:37:28,784
像是永遠活下去，看到這樣真棒
It's just kind of...

2095
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:28,700
living forever,
and it's amazing to see it.

2096
01:37:28,867 --> 01:37:31,703
哈利波特…
Harry Potter! Harry Potter!

2097
01:37:31,787 --> 01:37:34,706
沒有故事像「哈利波特」一樣
There's nothing like
the stories of Harry Potter.

2098
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:38,335
{\an5}電影裡訴說的這些故事
這些角色的旅程
The stories told within them,
the individual characters' journeys.

2099
01:37:38,418 --> 01:37:41,755
我認為這對大家
有重大改變的影響
I just think that has such
a transformative effect on people.

2100
01:37:41,838 --> 01:37:43,257
這就是魔法
That's magic.

2101
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,383
這裡真美
It's beautiful here.

2102
01:37:44,466 --> 01:37:47,594
{\an5}每個孩子都不知道要怎麼適應…
Every child wonders
how they're going to fit in

2103
01:37:47,678 --> 01:37:48,887
（托比瓊斯，飾多比）

2104
01:37:48,971 --> 01:37:52,307
{\an5}這是每個孩子史詩般的旅程
and it's an epic journey
that every child goes on.

2105
01:37:52,391 --> 01:37:54,768
多比會永遠服侍哈利波特
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

2106
01:37:54,851 --> 01:37:58,397
這對年輕人很鼓舞人心
「主角可能是我」
It's very inspiring
for young people to go

2107
01:37:57,104 --> 01:37:58,397
"Oh, that could be me there

2108
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,232
「經歷那些自我懷疑
或不確定的時刻」
having that moment of doubt

2109
01:38:00,315 --> 01:38:01,858
「或跟父母吵架」
or that wobble
or that argument with my parents."

2110
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:05,946
待在我身邊
Stay close to me.

2111
01:38:06,029 --> 01:38:07,447
直到最後
Until the end.

2112
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:13,453
{\an5}我投入了一個很棒的世界
I have found it

2113
01:38:11,076 --> 01:38:13,537
an extraordinary world
to be involved with

2114
01:38:13,537 --> 01:38:15,831
這個世界很棒
and it's a beautiful world.

2115
01:38:15,914 --> 01:38:17,332
敬哈利
- Harry.
- Harry.

2116
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,376
－敬哈利
－敬哈利

2117
01:38:19,459 --> 01:38:22,170
這很深刻，很療癒
- Harry.
- And that's what's
so profoundly therapeutic
and good about it

2118
01:38:22,254 --> 01:38:24,715
{\an5}而且很棒，因為這是…

2119
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:28,844
is it's made people who otherwise
feel lonely, they feel they belong.

2120
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:27,592
{\an5}由孤獨的人製作的

2121
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:29,219
他們不會感覺格格不入

2122
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:30,637
別給他，哈利
Don't give it to her, Harry.

2123
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,184
多數來跟我打招呼的影迷
Most of the fans
that come up and say hello to me now

2124
01:38:36,268 --> 01:38:38,520
{\an5}甚至是在我們拍電影後才出生的
weren't even born
when we made the film.

2125
01:38:38,603 --> 01:38:39,646
{\an5}（湯姆費爾頓，飾跩哥馬份）
So it quickly makes you feel
slightly older

2126
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:42,607
{\an5}很快就讓你覺得自己老了

2127
01:38:42,691 --> 01:38:49,197
我很感激這系列傳到了下一代
and very grateful that it's been
passed down to other generations.

2128
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:50,991
你在跳芭蕾，波特？
Training for the ballet, Potter?

2129
01:38:55,287 --> 01:38:57,497
{\an5}「哈利波特」的獨特之處
One of the things that was unique
about Harry Potter

2130
01:38:57,581 --> 01:38:59,499
{\an5}除了難以置信的想像力
besides the incredible imagination
and world

2131
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:04,212
和ＪＫ羅琳創造的
這些世界和角色之外
and characters
that Jo Rowling created

2132
01:39:04,296 --> 01:39:09,509
你還可以看到年輕人長成大人
was the fact that you get to see
young children grow into adults.

2133
01:39:09,968 --> 01:39:11,970
在電影看到這個歷程
And to see that journey on film

2134
01:39:12,054 --> 01:39:14,348
我認為我們並沒有看過這種事
I don't think
we've ever seen that before.

2135
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:16,183
我不知道我們會不會再次見識到
I don't know
if we'll ever see it again.

2136
01:39:16,266 --> 01:39:19,227
我覺得很幸運
可以成為這世界的一份子
It just feels so lucky
that I get to be part of a world that

2137
01:39:19,311 --> 01:39:20,771
大家很愛的這個世界
people love so much,
and makes people happy.

2138
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:22,898
讓大家開心的這個世界

2139
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:26,068
你可以找到逃避現實的東西
There's something about those...
The escapism you find.

2140
01:39:26,151 --> 01:39:28,070
逃避現實的健康方式
The healthy form of escapism.

2141
01:39:28,153 --> 01:39:30,906
我認為這就是
「哈利波特」的可貴之處
That, I think,
is kind of what Harry Potter does.

2142
01:39:30,989 --> 01:39:32,282
這就是這些故事的目的
And that's what
these stories are for.

2143
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:34,743
這些故事是生活指南
They are a guide to how to live.

2144
01:39:34,826 --> 01:39:37,496
我認為這是一個世代的結束
那是我人生的十年
I just think it's an end of an era.

2145
01:39:36,036 --> 01:39:37,412
It's a ten, ten years of my life

2146
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:40,749
而我的孩子們是在這期間長大的
and my children
have grown up during it.

2147
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:40,832
Of course.

2148
01:39:40,832 --> 01:39:43,126
羅比寇特蘭
That is Robbie Coltrane

2149
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,669
霍格華茲最棒的獵場看守人
finest gatekeeper in Hogwarts'
last day on Harry Potter.

2150
01:39:44,753 --> 01:39:46,505
今天是他拍
「哈利波特」的最後一天

2151
01:39:53,762 --> 01:39:54,971
我懷疑這系列電影的影響
The legacy of the movies
is that my children's generation

2152
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:58,225
我孩子們那一代
會給他們的孩子看

2153
01:39:56,181 --> 01:39:58,058
will show them to their children.

2154
01:39:58,308 --> 01:40:00,936
所以可以５０年後再看
So you could be watching it
in 50 years time, easy.

2155
01:40:02,312 --> 01:40:04,439
可惜我到時候已經不在了…
I'll not be here, sadly, but...

2156
01:40:05,982 --> 01:40:08,527
想都不要想
Don't you think on it for one minute.

2157
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,196
但是海格那時候還會在
But Hagrid will.

2158
01:40:10,612 --> 01:40:11,655
Yes.

2159
01:40:13,532 --> 01:40:15,534
現在回想起來
Kind of looking back at it now,
and...

2160
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:17,452
就是很美好的回憶
just really fond memories.

2161
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,954
我很常回想
I think about it a lot.

2162
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:21,289
那段時光很棒…
It was a great time.
It really was. It was...

2163
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:24,084
真的很棒
It was amazing.

2164
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:26,461
真的是最棒…
It was just the best, most...

2165
01:40:27,546 --> 01:40:29,673
最精彩的旅程
amazing experience, and...

2166
01:40:31,174 --> 01:40:33,802
我沒辦法解釋，他們人都超好的
I can't really explain to you.
Like, they're such good people.

2167
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:36,054
他們都很善良又…
They were so kind, and...

2168
01:40:37,389 --> 01:40:40,392
他們都很認真地承擔責任
they both took the responsibility
very seriously, and I...

2169
01:40:40,475 --> 01:40:43,895
而我對他們這樣非常感激

2170
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:43,937
appreciated that so much.

2171
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:45,856
我們真的很像一家人
It really is like family.

2172
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:48,400
內心都聯繫在一起
We're just so intrinsically linked.

2173
01:40:49,901 --> 01:40:51,820
他們對我來說是很重要的人
They're very important people to me.

2174
01:40:52,988 --> 01:40:54,990
電影的工作人員真不可思議
The crew on these films
were unbelievable.

2175
01:40:55,073 --> 01:40:56,867
這些電影裡有一些人…
There are people on these films
that are...

2176
01:40:58,994 --> 01:41:03,331
are foundational to who I am...

2177
01:41:01,496 --> 01:41:03,498
奠定了我身份的基礎

2178
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:09,129
身為一個人和演員
as a person and an actor.

2179
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:13,300
我很幸運能有現在的成就
經歷了這種人生
I feel so lucky to be where I am

2180
01:41:11,548 --> 01:41:13,258
and to have the life that I have

2181
01:41:13,383 --> 01:41:16,136
能跟現在身邊的人合作
and be able to work
with the people I work with now.

2182
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:19,306
但沒有這系列，這些都不可能
But none of it is possible
without this.

2183
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:21,725
所以…
So yeah. It was...

2184
01:41:22,684 --> 01:41:23,894
這非常…
It was very...

2185
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:26,771
這十年非常棒
It was a very good ten years.

2186
01:41:30,358 --> 01:41:32,986
疾疾，護法現身
Expecto patronum.

2187
01:41:44,789 --> 01:41:46,208
過了這麼久？
After all this time.

2188
01:41:47,626 --> 01:41:48,835
永遠
Always.

2189
01:42:44,766 --> 01:42:46,768
謝謝觀賞
