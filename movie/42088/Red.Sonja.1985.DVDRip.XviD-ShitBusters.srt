1
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:11,455
<i>Sonja.</i>

2
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:27,654
<i>You are suffering, Sonja...</i>

3
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:32,334
<i>but vengeance shall be yours.</i>

4
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:35,014
<i>Vengeance on Queen Gedren...</i>

5
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:38,134
<i>who wanted you for herself.</i>

6
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:42,573
<i>Your disgust was clear.</i>

7
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:51,013
<i>And so it was that Gedren</i>
<i>ordered your family murdered...</i>

8
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:56,653
<i>your body violated by her soldiers.</i>

9
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,573
<i>But in your quest</i>
<i>for justice and vengeance...</i>

10
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:06,012
<i>you will need great strength...</i>

11
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:11,132
<i>for your sword arm must have no equal.</i>

12
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:15,572
<i>I give you that strength.</i>

13
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,884
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?

14
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,324
He has not come, Highness.

15
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:09,564
He should be here
for the destruction of the talisman.

16
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:14,523
But we cannot delay.
We will proceed without him.

17
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:41,722
O God of the high Gods...

18
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:46,762
behold the talisman with which
you created the world and all things.

19
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,121
O God of Gods...

20
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:59,441
it has become too powerful for us...

21
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:03,801
and we must destroy it
before it destroys the world.

22
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,960
Forgive us now
as we send it out of the light...

23
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,280
from which it draws its power...

24
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,520
into eternal darkness.

25
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,519
Forgive us.

26
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,833
Come on.

27
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,832
So this can make worlds...

28
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:17,032
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.

29
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,312
Have it lifted out.

30
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:22,711
Lift it out!

31
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,230
Touch it.

32
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:53,387
So it is true. Only women may touch it.

33
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,027
The cover.

34
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:07,626
Take it out.

35
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:22,026
Great queen,
what shall we do with the prisoners?

36
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:34,385
- No!
- No!

37
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,024
Come.

38
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:24,583
Horses.

39
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,217
The talisman's stolen.

40
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:28,937
Must destroy the talisman.

41
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:33,977
We must find my sister. Take me.

42
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:38,176
I know where she is. Please.

43
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,175
Magnificent.

44
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,454
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.

45
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:30,814
You are the master of the master.

46
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,054
Never have l seen your equal.

47
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:51,333
You must learn to like men a little better.

48
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,173
They are not all evil.

49
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:57,853
We must judge by our own experience,
Grand Master.

50
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:59,013
I know.

51
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,772
But in life, all is not swordplay.

52
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:08,572
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman...

53
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,812
it could be your downfall.

54
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,892
I don't hate all men, Grand Master.

55
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,532
That would have been music to my ears
30 years ago.

56
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:22,331
Come.

57
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:27,251
A great swordsman
must have a great sword.

58
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:41,811
Choose.

59
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,850
A gift from the Grand Master.

60
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,530
<i>Sonja.</i>

61
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,730
What is it, Red Sonja?

62
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,648
I'm looking for Red Sonja.

63
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:48,207
- I am Sonja.
- Your sister's dying.

64
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,567
I'll take you to her.

65
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:46,885
Varna.

66
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,604
Thank God.

67
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,244
I've lived long enough.

68
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,804
The talisman's stolen.

69
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,284
All the priests massacred.

70
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:09,363
- We fought...
- Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.

71
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,083
There's no time. Listen.

72
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,963
The talisman has terrible power...

73
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:20,083
which grows in the light.

74
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:26,723
In 13 days it could destroy the world...

75
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:31,482
by storm and earthquake.

76
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,282
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.

77
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:46,162
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.

78
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,762
I swear.

79
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,322
Who took it?

80
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:52,561
I don't know.

81
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:57,361
There was a woman with a gold mask.

82
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,521
Soldiers.

83
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:02,481
Where did they take it? North? South?

84
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,560
She's dead.
And the living have work to do.

85
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,920
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.

86
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,800
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name is Kalidor.

87
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,960
I befriended your sister, remember?

88
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,159
I'm a friend of yours, too.

89
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,999
I thank you for what you did for my sister.
You will be rewarded.

90
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,799
I'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.

91
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,439
If l think somebody owes me something,
l take it.

92
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,837
Someone is using the talisman.

93
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:34,637
- What place is that?
- Hablok. It's a great city.

94
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:41,716
Where are you going?

95
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:43,956
Hablok.

96
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,556
Wait. I'll come with you.

97
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:51,316
Why should you? It's no business of yours.

98
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,196
And neither am I.

99
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:55,516
You may be wrong on both counts.

100
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:59,075
I know you're a brave girl,
but danger is my trade.

101
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,315
Then l'll learn it by myself.

102
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:08,355
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.

103
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,075
I don't need any man's help.

104
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:35,074
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady!
Can you do nothing right?

105
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:37,354
Still, you great idiot.

106
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,113
I'm trying, Your Highness.

107
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:45,073
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb,
useless, selfish beast!

108
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:47,193
Quickly, come. Come to me.

109
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:51,033
Don't give me orders, slave.
I'll have you hung by the heels.

110
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,273
Anyway, it's too slippery.

111
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:57,313
Do you want me to fall
in that boiling mud? You numskull.

112
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,592
I'll try to swing it around. Now.

113
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:03,272
- Hold still, boy.
- Boy?

114
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:10,192
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.

115
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,431
Jump off. Jump.

116
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,271
What about me?

117
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,951
Get back here and stop playing the fool.

118
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,990
I hear and obey, master of the world.
I'm coming.

119
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:11,949
Lucky for you that this person came along.

120
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,109
Reward her, and tell her who l am.

121
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,989
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn,
Great Lord of Hablok...

122
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,228
keeper of the spotless throne...

123
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:26,748
great elephant who fertilizes the world
with his...

124
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:28,948
l've told you not to say that.

125
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,788
Do it again, and l'll have you impaled.

126
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:36,068
Well, reward her, fool.

127
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,627
From the look of your kingdom, Prince,
you need this more than l do.

128
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:55,947
Did she address me?

129
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:58,907
What happened?

130
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,747
Queen Gedren attacked us
is what happened.

131
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:04,626
Gedren? Queen Gedren?

132
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,426
That's right.

133
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:11,426
She knocked down half the city with her
new weapon and demanded our surrender.

134
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,026
My army ran away.

135
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,746
Do they want to live forever?

136
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:17,866
I refused to surrender.

137
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:20,826
So she knocked down the other half.

138
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:25,026
Falkon, since everyone is dead
or run away...

139
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,945
you shall escort me
to the mountains tomorrow.

140
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,865
I shall raise a new army...

141
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,185
and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.

142
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,505
Where can l find her, this Queen Gedren?

143
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,345
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.

144
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:40,705
How do l get there?

145
00:25:40,745 --> 00:25:44,625
There's a long scenic way, and there's
the short way through Brytag's toll road.

146
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:47,664
I'll take Brytag's toll road.
Which way is that?

147
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:51,544
Straight north from here.
You can't miss it.

148
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,304
But it's worth a try.

149
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,024
Ask the woman
if she wishes to join my army.

150
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:01,584
We'll probably need a cook.

151
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:04,704
Your Highness is too kind,
but l travel alone.

152
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:09,703
Dismiss the woman, Falkon.
I shall dine in an hour.

153
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,823
May l give you a word of advice?

154
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,223
Put him over your knee
and beat some manners into him.

155
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:25,703
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth,
would you?

156
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,860
Brytag, come down and open the gate.

157
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,980
Not so fast, redhead.

158
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,700
I'm up here
where l can get a better look at you.

159
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,020
I have no time to waste, Brytag.

160
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,419
I have plenty. Come up, l say.

161
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:19,057
- Come here, wench.
- Why should I?

162
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:25,657
Because l am Brytag. This is my land.

163
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:29,177
All that pass through pay me tribute.

164
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:31,817
- How much, Brytag?
- Who mentioned money?

165
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:34,216
Tribute, l said.

166
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,296
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.

167
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:48,216
Suppose l don't.

168
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:52,296
Suppose, instead, l open up
that great fat belly of yours.

169
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:57,975
You hear that?

170
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,775
She's going to open up my great...

171
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:06,495
Woman, l have fought 177 men.

172
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,615
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.

173
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,175
You dare to mock at Brytag?

174
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:14,735
That takes no daring.

175
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:22,054
But when l've killed you,
will your warriors let me go unharmed?

176
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:24,534
When you've killed me?

177
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:30,894
When this wench has killed me,
you will let her go unharmed, won't you?

178
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,374
Aye.

179
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:38,933
See?

180
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,693
So, wench.

181
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,853
I'm gonna feed your eyes
to the birds, red hair.

182
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:52,893
I don't need eyes to find you.

183
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:55,373
I can smell you at a hundred paces.

184
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,450
I will tell the future in your entrails,
red woman.

185
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,530
I know my future. You have none.

186
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:39,248
Hold on, Sonja.

187
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,247
Sonja, come on.

188
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,126
Look out!

189
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,445
This way. Follow me!

190
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,605
- Get away. Go!
- What about you?

191
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,365
I can hold them. Go!

192
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,685
Hurry! Stop them!

193
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:15,723
Release me, ruffian!

194
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:17,523
Release me, l say!

195
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:21,563
- Tell us where it is.
- I'll have your head for this!

196
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,043
Don't be shy.

197
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:27,682
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?

198
00:33:28,362 --> 00:33:30,282
There is no gold, ruffian.

199
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:38,002
I tell you, l have no gold!

200
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:43,402
You have fine raiment, boy,
almost as resplendent as mine.

201
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,642
And you expect me to believe
you're penniless?

202
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:50,761
I'll have you know, villain,
l am Prince Tarn of Hablok.

203
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:54,481
My subjects will see
to your punishment for this.

204
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,961
And a grievous punishment it will be,
impertinent oaf!

205
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:00,641
Your subjects?

206
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:03,161
My kingdom is greater than yours.

207
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,121
And l have but four.

208
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,360
Pull him!

209
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:16,917
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty?
- Yes, clumsy oaf.

210
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:19,677
Why did you leave him?

211
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:22,037
We needed food. I went hunting.

212
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:24,157
You could have taken him with you.

213
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:27,117
Tell her, Falkon,
that l don't care for hunting.

214
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:31,157
He doesn't care for hunting.

215
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:03,195
Treasure to the vaults,
prisoners to the dungeons.

216
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,755
Take the talisman back
to the Chamber of Lights.

217
00:36:06,795 --> 00:36:08,515
Very well, my queen.

218
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:38,670
Perhaps fewer candles...

219
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,230
would be advisable, Your Majesty.

220
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,710
Why?

221
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,230
The stronger the light, the greater
the power of the talisman grows.

222
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,310
I want more light here, not less.

223
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,910
But it is dangerously powerful already,
great queen.

224
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,190
- Look what it did to Hablok.
- Yes. Very satisfying.

225
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,669
But l want its full power
when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.

226
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:02,109
Its full power.

227
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:05,309
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty.
- Majesty!

228
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,989
Enemies are approaching
the outer empire.

229
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,504
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty...

230
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,424
with his army.

231
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:48,744
Insects.

232
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,464
That girl.

233
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:00,184
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.

234
00:40:01,424 --> 00:40:05,783
Ikol, l want her alive
without so much as a scratch on her skin.

235
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:08,943
Shall l send out a small ambush party?

236
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:12,183
No.

237
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:15,863
We'll wait till they get a little closer.

238
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:35,582
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.

239
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:38,582
Falkon, proclaim my arrival...

240
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:41,142
and the defiance of Queen Gedren.

241
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:43,142
Sound your trumpet.

242
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:45,302
Keep quiet...

243
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:48,341
at least till we find a way across.

244
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:52,221
Princes do not sneak in
on their enemies like thieves.

245
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:55,501
You don't know
much about princes, do you?

246
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,460
You wait here with the horses.

247
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,539
I want to test this bridge first.

248
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,699
Or whatever it is.

249
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:12,457
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.

250
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,377
Now hear me, Gedren!

251
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:20,017
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...

252
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:23,577
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of Burkubane.

253
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:27,457
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.

254
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:29,937
How dare you, woman?

255
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:31,856
I'll show you how l dare.

256
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:34,376
This should have been done long ago.

257
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:37,936
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.

258
00:42:40,896 --> 00:42:42,976
You're not worth the effort, boy.

259
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:45,056
Boy?

260
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:47,816
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...

261
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:51,336
till you learn gratitude
and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.

262
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,095
He's a real man.

263
00:43:00,255 --> 00:43:04,295
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.

264
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:23,054
Take that, ruffian.

265
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:38,293
Take that, you ruffian.

266
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:54,613
Practicing, Highness?

267
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:58,372
I thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.

268
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:01,452
I was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.

269
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:04,532
I noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.

270
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:07,172
I am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.

271
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:09,252
Come on!

272
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:20,171
You're meant to be
using your sword. Remember?

273
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:29,091
Simple, isn't it?

274
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:31,691
But it's not in the rule book.

275
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:34,891
You see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.

276
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:37,450
You need to learn them both.

277
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:52,290
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?

278
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,290
If you please?

279
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,569
Spoken like a prince.

280
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:09,289
You were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.

281
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:11,409
Grip gently. See?

282
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,329
Gently. I see. Like this?

283
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:20,888
Your Highness learns fast.

284
00:45:21,768 --> 00:45:25,168
I think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.

285
00:45:26,488 --> 00:45:28,208
We've an early start.

286
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:30,448
You are very beautiful.

287
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:33,928
When l am king of Hablok,
l shall have you at my court.

288
00:45:34,808 --> 00:45:37,048
You will? My, the honor.

289
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:40,527
I may even make you my queen.

290
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,007
But l'm still young.

291
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,247
We shall have to see.

292
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:19,686
They will reach
the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.

293
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:22,445
We must force them to take shelter there.

294
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:25,685
The killing machine will do the rest.

295
00:46:25,765 --> 00:46:28,085
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.

296
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:31,205
But not the girl.

297
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:35,045
I want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.

298
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:39,165
I'll do my best, my queen.

299
00:46:39,685 --> 00:46:42,565
The machine is difficult to control.

300
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:46,004
One cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.

301
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:50,884
If it does, you will be its next victim.

302
00:47:02,644 --> 00:47:06,363
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.

303
00:47:07,843 --> 00:47:09,163
A little one.

304
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:22,563
We should be out in the storm.

305
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:25,482
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?

306
00:47:25,562 --> 00:47:29,562
I haven't got time to shelter.
I've four days left to find the talisman.

307
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,402
Besides, something drove us in here...

308
00:47:34,762 --> 00:47:36,482
every bit of the way.

309
00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:40,282
I noticed it, but l'm not complaining.

310
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:44,842
Where's Tarn?

311
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,441
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, l'll go find him.

312
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:56,801
Look at this.

313
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:05,681
It must be the biggest in the world.

314
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,840
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.

315
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,360
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...

316
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,440
fill its treasury, buy me an army.

317
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,560
Dig it out!

318
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,400
Your Highness,
it may belong to somebody.

319
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,320
It does, and he wants it now!

320
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:29,759
Yeah.

321
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,919
Use your dagger, fool!

322
00:48:58,278 --> 00:48:59,598
What are you doing?

323
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:02,278
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!

324
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:06,078
Come on. Put your back into it.

325
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:09,597
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.

326
00:49:09,957 --> 00:49:12,837
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.

327
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:25,917
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!

328
00:49:55,915 --> 00:49:57,995
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.

329
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:02,155
Climb up here, my prince.

330
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:35,273
Tarn!

331
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,393
I'm coming, my prince!

332
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:49,193
Let go!

333
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:18,431
Where is she?

334
00:52:55,227 --> 00:52:57,507
I can't kill it! It's a machine!

335
00:53:13,426 --> 00:53:15,466
Sonja, we have to blind it!

336
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,346
It's our only chance!

337
00:53:46,664 --> 00:53:49,144
Falkon, get out! It can't see!

338
00:54:35,182 --> 00:54:37,622
There. Keep it covered.

339
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:41,422
Why have you been following me?

340
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:43,862
To see that you reach the talisman safely.

341
00:54:43,942 --> 00:54:45,061
Why?

342
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:48,421
I have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.

343
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:51,381
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

344
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:54,261
had entrusted the talisman
to the priestesses...

345
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:56,621
because only women may touch it.

346
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:59,861
But to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...

347
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,821
is still the duty of the High Lord.

348
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:04,941
You? The High Lord?

349
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,900
I was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...

350
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,140
when l found your sister dying...

351
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,740
and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.

352
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,100
So she guided me to you.

353
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,620
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

354
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,500
You didn't seem to want a man's help.

355
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,539
But you needed it,
so that's why l followed you.

356
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:29,859
I had to be sure you reached the talisman.

357
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:31,779
I see.

358
00:55:32,819 --> 00:55:35,859
I misunderstood.
I thought you had another reason.

359
00:55:43,379 --> 00:55:44,539
I did.

360
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:56,858
No. I'm under a vow.

361
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:03,378
No man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.

362
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:12,457
So the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.

363
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:16,097
That's logic.

364
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:46,936
If you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.

365
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,415
Don't be a fool. I don't want to kill you.

366
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:03,175
Try it.

367
00:57:11,174 --> 00:57:12,414
Come on.

368
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:24,094
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.

369
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:45,373
Are you all right?

370
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:48,453
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.

371
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:51,093
Then let me down!

372
00:57:58,172 --> 00:57:59,452
Thank you.

373
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:21,288
Why does she fight so hard?

374
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:23,768
She doesn't want to win.

375
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:02,363
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.

376
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:33,002
The talisman! We must find a way in.

377
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,841
We'll have to climb.

378
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,921
Three of us should go in.

379
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:57,481
Who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?

380
01:01:58,321 --> 01:02:00,281
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?

381
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:03,161
I don't know what's coming out that door.
No, l am going up.

382
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,400
Coward!

383
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,840
I'll take my chances in there.

384
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,920
And l have to go in.

385
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,560
I'll stay.

386
01:02:29,399 --> 01:02:31,279
Take care, Your Highness.

387
01:02:47,198 --> 01:02:48,438
Thank you.

388
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:09,435
Tomorrow, l start my diet.

389
01:04:14,034 --> 01:04:16,674
Majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.

390
01:04:16,754 --> 01:04:19,194
We must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!

391
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:22,914
It'll be buried when l have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.

392
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:26,714
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?

393
01:04:26,994 --> 01:04:30,394
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!

394
01:04:30,474 --> 01:04:32,953
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!

395
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:36,313
Today we took another piece
of the city of Toktyl.

396
01:04:36,393 --> 01:04:39,953
But l have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!

397
01:04:40,953 --> 01:04:43,433
Madness. There will be no world.

398
01:04:44,473 --> 01:04:47,073
There will be no world.

399
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,070
We must find the talisman.
Only l can touch it, remember.

400
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:53,430
You take that way, l'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.

401
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:06,429
How's the food around here?

402
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:08,749
Who are you?

403
01:07:13,546 --> 01:07:15,986
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.

404
01:07:36,425 --> 01:07:39,224
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.

405
01:07:39,304 --> 01:07:41,704
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:

406
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:44,984
The city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.

407
01:07:48,744 --> 01:07:51,584
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.

408
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:54,064
Out of my way, child.

409
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:57,944
So that you can desert,
like the thief you are?

410
01:07:59,304 --> 01:08:00,823
With my gold?

411
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,063
Hablok's gold?

412
01:08:08,903 --> 01:08:12,303
Now that was unmannerly
of Your Highness...

413
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:16,223
and rude little boys need correction...

414
01:08:16,543 --> 01:08:19,623
if they're going to grow up into...

415
01:08:27,462 --> 01:08:31,102
l'm afraid Your Highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.

416
01:08:35,942 --> 01:08:39,142
Now, yield, Black Spider.

417
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,339
Where's Queen Gedren?

418
01:09:27,419 --> 01:09:30,179
She's gone. I'm so glad that you've come.

419
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:35,579
Please, will you protect me?
I'm so frightened.

420
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:51,458
Gedren! Where are you?

421
01:09:53,538 --> 01:09:57,538
So the Prince of Hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.

422
01:09:57,858 --> 01:10:02,138
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?

423
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,657
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!

424
01:10:10,177 --> 01:10:13,137
Get back, or Hablok will need
an heir to the throne.

425
01:10:13,217 --> 01:10:15,137
And your own throne, Gedren.

426
01:10:15,217 --> 01:10:19,017
Unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...

427
01:10:23,257 --> 01:10:25,457
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.

428
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:29,096
There's a way behind the throne.

429
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:32,856
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!

430
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:37,256
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.

431
01:10:37,336 --> 01:10:41,696
Now l shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.

432
01:10:41,776 --> 01:10:43,136
What l did?

433
01:10:43,616 --> 01:10:46,336
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.

434
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:48,855
My brother, my sister!

435
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:51,735
Vermin! What were their lives
compared to this?

436
01:10:52,775 --> 01:10:56,175
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.

437
01:11:53,052 --> 01:11:54,692
Up here, Sonja.

438
01:11:56,572 --> 01:11:57,772
Up here.

439
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:09,286
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!

440
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,524
Down this hallway!

441
01:14:50,684 --> 01:14:52,724
Sonja. Over here.

442
01:15:05,483 --> 01:15:06,923
Falkon, help.

443
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,442
Prince Tarn, come back.

444
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:25,962
I am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.

445
01:15:53,401 --> 01:15:55,121
Sonja, help me!

446
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:56,801
I'm trapped!

447
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,360
Sonja! Behind you!

448
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:16,557
I can't get through.

449
01:17:19,277 --> 01:17:22,157
Falkon, pull her through. I'll hold the gate.

450
01:18:22,234 --> 01:18:24,474
Follow me. This is the way out.

451
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:32,913
How do you know, Highness?

452
01:18:32,993 --> 01:18:35,593
Because this is the way
l came in, you clown.

453
01:18:46,993 --> 01:18:48,713
Here's the way through.

454
01:18:48,793 --> 01:18:50,152
Go. Quickly!

455
01:19:13,351 --> 01:19:14,631
The door doesn't move.

456
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:15,911
How does it open?

457
01:19:15,991 --> 01:19:17,831
I know. Leave it to me.

458
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:20,511
No! Come back, Prince!

459
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,550
He's done it.

460
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:36,950
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.

461
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,350
Save yourselves! Run for it!

462
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,990
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!

463
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,310
Run! Run for it!

464
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:50,990
I'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.

465
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:56,349
Give me your hand. Reach. I'll get you out.

466
01:21:04,066 --> 01:21:05,826
Hablok is over there.

467
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,866
When it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.

468
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:11,386
I'm sure to need a queen someday.

469
01:21:11,426 --> 01:21:12,986
You'll find one.

470
01:21:13,186 --> 01:21:16,225
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.

471
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:21,185
I make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.

472
01:21:21,745 --> 01:21:24,745
That's a challenge
l might think about someday.

473
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,225
What about right now?

474
01:21:33,225 --> 01:21:34,425
Why not?

475
01:22:05,183 --> 01:22:06,863
Come along, Falkon.

476
01:22:07,663 --> 01:22:08,583
Come on.

477
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:56,335
English
