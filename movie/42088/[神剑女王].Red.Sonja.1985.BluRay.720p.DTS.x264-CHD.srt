273
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,542
Or whatever it is.
或者说是这类似桥的东西

274
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:18,980
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.
它看起来很安全
我们牵着马过去

275
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:24,108
Now hear me, Gedren!
现在听我说，戈登!

276
00:44:24,185 --> 00:44:26,879
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...
这就是我，哈勃洛克的王子……

277
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:30,577
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of Burkubane.
为自己报仇
在粗暴的布拉库班身上

278
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:34,608
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.
小声点，你太自大了，忘恩负义的家伙

279
00:44:35,419 --> 00:44:37,214
How dare you, woman?
你怎么害怕了，女人?

280
00:44:37,286 --> 00:44:39,218
I'll show you how I dare.
我让你看我有多害怕

281
00:44:39,286 --> 00:44:41,809
This should have been done long ago.
这是我很早之前就想做的

282
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:45,517
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.
不，如果你一定要打人，就打我吧

283
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,779
You're not worth the effort, boy.
你没有这个能力，孩子

284
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,944
Boy?
孩子?

285
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,816
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...
是的，孩子，你将失去所有除非……

286
00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:59,479
till you learn gratitude
and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.
直到你学会感激
和自我牺牲，像法拉肯那样

287
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:01,312
He's a real man.
他是真男人

288
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:12,982
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.
她不是这个意思，王子
她不知道你是上等人

289
00:45:30,823 --> 00:45:32,550
Take that, ruffian.
看招，恶棍

290
00:45:46,524 --> 00:45:48,422
Take that, you ruffian.
看招，你是恶棍

291
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:05,420
Practicing, Highness?
在练功，王子?

292
00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:09,317
I thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.
我想王子既然每一件事都做得这么好
应该不需要别人帮忙的

293
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:12,553
I was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.
那天这些恶棍来时我没带武器

294
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:15,751
I noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.
我注意到了，所以?但这不是致命的

295
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,488
I am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.
我现在也没带武器，杀了我，来吧

296
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:20,652
Come on!
来吧!

297
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,021
You're meant to be
using your sword. Remember?
你应该用你的剑，记住了么?

298
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,320
Simple, isn't it?
很简单，是不是?

299
00:46:41,793 --> 00:46:44,021
But it's not in the rule book.
但这不是书上的规则

300
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:47,356
You see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.
你看，击剑和好战是两种不同的事

301
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,019
You need to learn them both.
两样你都需要学

302
00:47:01,462 --> 00:47:05,485
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?
你可以教我击剑和战斗?

303
00:47:07,095 --> 00:47:08,618
If you please?
求你了?

304
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,157
Spoken like a prince.
这样说才有点像王子

305
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:23,221
You were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.
你兵器脱手了
是因为你握剑柄太牢了

306
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:25,429
Grip gently. See?
轻轻的握住，看到了么?

307
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,593
Gently. I see. Like this?
轻轻的，我看，就像这样?

308
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,287
Your Highness learns fast.
殿下你学得真快

309
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:39,755
I think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.
我想下次我们应该继续你的击剑课程

310
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:42,926
We've an early start.
我们尽快开始

311
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:45,260
You are very beautiful.
你非常漂亮

312
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:48,888
When I am king of Hablok,
I shall have you at my court.
当我成为哈勃洛克国王时
我可以将我的宫殿给你

313
00:47:49,797 --> 00:47:52,127
You will? My, the honor.
你真这样想么?我很感激你

314
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:55,760
I may even make you my queen.
我或许还可以让你成为我的皇后

315
00:47:56,198 --> 00:47:58,323
But I'm still young.
但我太年轻了

316
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,661
We shall have to see.
我们以后再说

317
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:36,558
They will reach
the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.
他们快到了
明天应该能到Ithian洞穴

318
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:39,430
We must force them to take shelter there.
我们必须派人保护那儿

319
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,794
The killing machine will do the rest.
这个杀人机器也许可以帮我们完成这个任务

320
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:45,299
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.
是的，他们将成为它的美餐

321
00:48:46,902 --> 00:48:48,561
But not the girl.
但不包括那个女孩

322
00:48:48,902 --> 00:48:52,561
I want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.
我想这么美丽的人伴在我身边
看到她就这么死了有点舍不得

323
00:48:53,968 --> 00:48:56,832
I'll do my best, my queen.
我会尽量做得最好的，女王

324
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:00,392
The machine is difficult to control.
但这个机器很难控制

325
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:03,958
One cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.
不能保证万一出现什么问题

326
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,065
If it does, you will be its next victim.
如果这样，你将会成为下一个受害者

327
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:25,168
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.
把神器带来，阿克罗，我们需要风暴

328
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:28,101
A little one.
小一点的

329
00:49:40,138 --> 00:49:42,070
We should be out in the storm.
我们需要使风暴停止

330
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,094
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?
为什么?我们可以在这里躲避它，不是么?

331
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:49,332
I haven't got time to shelter.
I've four days left to find the talisman.
我没有时间去避难
我只有4天时间去找神器

332
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:54,397
Besides, something drove us in here...
而且，有人往这边来了

333
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,534
every bit of the way.
每一条路上

334
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,498
I noticed it, but I'm not complaining.
我知道这些，但我不是抱怨

335
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,271
Where's Tarn?
王子在哪里?

336
00:50:06,806 --> 00:50:10,068
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, I'll go find him.
他说过不会走开的
你在这儿烘干衣服，我去找他

337
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,729
Look at this.
看看这个

338
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:26,963
It must be the biggest in the world.
这一定是世界上最大的

339
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:35,464
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.
可能是假的
这附近有很多脏东西

340
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:38,099
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...
这颗珍珠能用来重建哈勃洛克……

341
00:50:38,175 --> 00:50:41,300
fill its treasury, buy me an army.
用它填满国库，用来建一支军队

342
00:50:42,176 --> 00:50:43,505
Dig it out!
挖走它

343
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:46,474
Your Highness,
it may belong to somebody.

它可能属于某人所有

344
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:49,507
It does, and he wants it now!
是的，并且他马上要!

345
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:52,034
Yeah.
好吧

346
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:00,574
Use your dagger, fool!
用你的匕首，笨蛋!

347
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,142
What are you doing?
你在做什么?

348
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:25,939
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!
法拉肯，殿下，看很多水!

349
00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:29,876
Come on. Put your back into it.
来吧，把你力气都用进去

350
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:33,572
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.
它不会动
或许它不想出来

351
00:51:33,912 --> 00:51:36,935
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.
水在上涨
你必须离开这里

352
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,570
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!
这边!往台阶那边去!
走，王子!

353
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:23,973
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.
离开水!
是

354
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:28,306
Climb up here, my prince.

355
00:53:01,684 --> 00:53:02,809

I can't kill it! It's a machine!

Sonja, we have to blind it!

There. Keep it covered.

364

Why have you been following me?

00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:26,526
I have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.

368
00:57:27,134 --> 00:57:29,622
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

369
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,633
had entrusted the talisman

把神器交给女祭司……

370
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,064
because only women may touch it.

371
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:38,458
But to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...
但要保护它，或者如果需要破坏它的话……

372
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:41,523
is still the duty of the High Lord.
仍然是高贵的君主的职责

373
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:43,758
You? The High Lord?

374
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:48,897
I was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...

when I found your sister dying...

376

and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.
并且知道神器被偷走了

377
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:56,432
So she guided me to you.

378
00:57:56,502 --> 00:57:59,025
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

379
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:03,093
You didn't seem to want a man's help.
你好像从来不要男人的帮助

380
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:06,260
But you needed it,
so that's why I followed you.
但你需要它
这就是我跟着你的原因

381
00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:09,700
I had to be sure you reached the talisman.

I see.

383
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:15,964
I misunderstood.
I thought you had another reason.
我误解了
我认为你有别的目的

384
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:24,996
I did.

385
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:37,834
No. I'm under a vow.
不，我发过誓

386
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:44,632
No man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.
没有人能得到我除非他能打败我

387
00:58:49,972 --> 00:58:54,098
So the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.
也就是说只有设法杀了你的男人才能得到你

388
00:58:56,406 --> 00:58:57,872
That's logic.
很有逻辑性

389
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:30,005
If you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.
如果你只屈服于征服者
那就整备被征服

390
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:45,102

391
00:59:45,742 --> 00:59:46,935
Try it.
试过再说

392
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:56,536
Come on.
来吧

393
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,703
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.
到那边打去
我们正在睡觉

394
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:30,871
Are you all right?
你没事吧?

395
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:34,100
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.
是的，王子，我们只是在练习而已

396
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:36,838
Then let me down!
放我下去

397
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:45,543
Thank you.
谢谢

398
01:02:08,717 --> 01:02:10,809
Why does she fight so hard?
为什么她打得这么激烈?

399
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:13,384
She doesn't want to win.

400
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:56,089
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.
戈登的军队
又一个王国被征服了

401
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,025
The talisman! We must find a way in.
那个神器!我们必须找到一条路进去

402
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,488
We'll have to climb.
我们攀爬进去

403
01:04:47,827 --> 01:04:49,816
Three of us should go in.
我们中3个人必须去

404
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:53,520
Who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?
谁可以留下来守这道门
这个危险的工作?

405
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,451
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?
法拉肯?
我?这里?

406
01:04:56,528 --> 01:04:59,460
I don't know what's coming out that door.
No, I am going up.
我不知道出了这道门会发生什么事
不，我能力不够

407
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,721
Coward!
懦夫

408
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:03,256
I'll take my chances in there.
我留下来

409
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:05,457
And I have to go in.
我继续往前

410
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:18,592
I'll stay.
我留下来吧

411
01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:28,752
Take care, Your Highness.
小心点，殿下

412
01:05:45,331 --> 01:05:46,627
Thank you.
谢谢

413
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,993
Tomorrow, I start my diet.
明天，我要开始减肥

414
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:18,531
Majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.
陛下，神器已经快无法控制了

415
01:07:18,604 --> 01:07:21,161
We must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!
我们必须把它埋在暗处
现在做还不晚!

416
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:25,034
It'll be buried when I have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.
它会在对我们没用之后再埋掉
那时也还不迟

417
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:29,002
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?
但它会杀了我们!
哦，天哪，陛下，你想干什么?

418
01:07:29,304 --> 01:07:32,827
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!
我们的金库已充满黄金
就算是最强大的国家现在也害怕我们

419
01:07:32,904 --> 01:07:35,496
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!
我们该知足了?
世界，阿克罗!

420
01:07:35,805 --> 01:07:38,999
Today we took another piece
of the city of Toktyl.
今天我们只是拿下塔克特城的另一部分

421
01:07:39,072 --> 01:07:42,765
But I have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!
但现在我又有更大的欲望，
而神器能使我的欲望实现!

422
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:46,430
Madness. There will be no world.
疯了，世界将毁灭了

423
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:50,198
There will be no world.
世界将毁灭了

424
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:53,740
We must find the talisman.
Only I can touch it, remember.
我们必须找到神器
记住，只有我能碰它

425
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:59,337
You take that way, I'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.
你走那条路，我走这条路
法拉肯，你走中间那条

426
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,868
How's the food around here?
身边怎么这么多食物?

427
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:15,274
Who are you?
你是谁?

428
01:10:22,815 --> 01:10:25,338
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.
去找神器
好的，马上去

429
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,549
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.
阿克罗，你这个戈登的爪牙
你是?

430
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:52,139
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:
对，我是哈勃洛克王子

431
01:10:52,216 --> 01:10:55,546
The city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.
来自被你用肮脏的巫术破坏的那座城市

432
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:02,416
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.
看来王子你还没吸取教训

433
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,012
Out of my way, child.
离我远点，小毛孩

434
01:11:05,984 --> 01:11:09,042
So that you can desert,
like the thief you are?
你以为你能像小偷一样逃跑吗?

435
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:12,042
With my gold?
带着我的黄金?

436
01:11:12,884 --> 01:11:14,373
Hablok's gold?
哈勃洛克的黄金?

437
01:11:20,452 --> 01:11:24,009
Now that was unmannerly
of Your Highness...
现在你这个粗鲁的家伙……

438
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:28,108
and rude little boys need correction...
没礼貌的小毛孩必须改过……

439
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:31,612
if they're going to grow up into...
如果他们将你培养成为……

440
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:43,582
I'm afraid Your Highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.
我恐怕你们的王室将就此灭亡

441
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,950
Now, yield, Black Spider.
现在，投降吧，爪牙

442
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,185
Where's Queen Gedren?
戈登女王在哪里?

443
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:45,121
She's gone. I'm so glad that you've come.
她离开了。很高兴你的到来

444
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,747
Please, will you protect me?
I'm so frightened.
你可以保护我么?
我很害怕

445
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:07,289
Gedren! Where are you?
戈登!你在哪里?

446
01:13:09,491 --> 01:13:13,618
So the Prince of Hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.
原来哈勃洛克的王子是这么没用的

447
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:18,448
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?
和你一起来的有几个人?
告诉我!和你一起来的有几个人?

448
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:22,090
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!
有几个?
够了，戈登!

449
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,883
Get back, or Hablok will need
an heir to the throne.
退后，不然我杀了哈勃洛克王子

450
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:31,982
And your own throne, Gedren.
想办法保住你自己的王位吧，戈登

451
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:36,015
Unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...
除非神器进入黑暗之处，
否则你的整个王国将……

452
01:13:40,426 --> 01:13:42,722
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.
王子，快到凯利多和法拉肯身边去

453
01:13:44,194 --> 01:13:46,524
There's a way behind the throne.
龙椅后面有条路

454
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,422
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!
交出神器，戈登，快!

455
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:55,020
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.
你想得太天真了
本来我们可以一起统治世界

456
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:59,652
Now I shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.
但现在我将一个人统治了
你将因对我所做的这些而死

457
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,160
What I did?
我做了什么?

458
01:14:01,629 --> 01:14:04,493
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.
你像杀牛一样样杀害我父母

459
01:14:04,562 --> 01:14:07,119
My brother, my sister!
我的兄弟，我的姐妹!

460
01:14:07,362 --> 01:14:10,090
Vermin! What were their lives
compared to this?
够了!跟我这相比那些算得了什么?

461
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,719
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.
你这个疯子!
神器会杀死你

462
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:15,693
Up here, Sonja.
上来，桑妮亚

463
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:18,894
Up here.
上来

464
01:17:32,008 --> 01:17:35,907
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!
凯利多，法拉肯，走这边!快!

465
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:06,366
Down this hallway!
沿着这走廊走!

466
01:18:19,044 --> 01:18:21,169
Sonja. Over here.
桑妮亚，到这边来

467
01:18:34,445 --> 01:18:35,933
Falkon, help.
法拉肯，帮忙

468
01:18:50,646 --> 01:18:52,135
Prince Tarn, come back.
王子，回来

469
01:18:52,213 --> 01:18:55,771
I am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.
我在这里，戈登。我要杀死所有暴君

470
01:19:24,382 --> 01:19:26,143
Sonja, help me!
桑妮亚，快来帮我!

471
01:19:26,482 --> 01:19:27,913
I'm trapped!
我被压住了!

472
01:19:32,782 --> 01:19:35,771
Sonja! Behind you!
桑妮亚!小心你后面!

473
01:20:49,253 --> 01:20:51,014
I can't get through.
我通不过

474
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:56,820
Falkon, pull her through. I'll hold the gate.
法拉肯，拉她过来。我来顶住门

475
01:21:59,424 --> 01:22:01,754
Follow me. This is the way out.
跟我走，这是出去的路

476
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:10,548
How do you know, Highness?
你怎么知道的，殿下?

477
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:13,318
Because this is the way
I came in, you clown.
因为我从这里进来的，笨蛋

478
01:22:25,226 --> 01:22:27,021
Here's the way through.
这里有路可以过去

479
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:28,490
Go. Quickly!
走，快!

480
01:22:52,694 --> 01:22:54,024
The door doesn't move.
这门推不动

481
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,355
How does it open?
要怎么打开它?

482
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:57,326
I know. Leave it to me.
我知道，交给我好了

483
01:22:58,261 --> 01:23:00,124
No! Come back, Prince!
不要!快回来，王子!

484
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:13,728
He's done it.
他成功了

485
01:23:13,795 --> 01:23:17,250
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.
我们不能抛下他
等一下，我的王子，不要离开

486
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:23,928
Save yourselves! Run for it!
你们自己救自己吧!快跑!

487
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:26,689
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!
你也是，法拉肯，你这个笨蛋!

488
01:23:26,996 --> 01:23:29,087
Run! Run for it!
快跑!离开这里!

489
01:23:29,163 --> 01:23:31,891
I'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.
除非和你一起走，不然我不会走的
我的王子

490
01:23:33,964 --> 01:23:37,452
Give me your hand. Reach. I'll get you out.
把你手给我，伸过来，我拉你出来

491
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:49,830
Hablok is over there.
哈勃洛克在那边

492
01:24:50,035 --> 01:24:53,001
When it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.
当它重建以后
你一定要来探望我们

493
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:55,633
I'm sure to need a queen someday.
我相信有一天会需要一个皇后

494
01:24:55,702 --> 01:24:57,292
You'll find one.
你会找到一个的

495
01:24:57,535 --> 01:25:00,695
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.
不论她是谁，王子，细心挑选

496
01:25:01,269 --> 01:25:05,860
I make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.
我自己定了规则，终身不娶，
除非她能击败我。

497
01:25:06,436 --> 01:25:09,561
That's a challenge
I might think about someday.
这个挑战将来我或许会考虑一下

498
01:25:10,336 --> 01:25:12,131
What about right now?
现在怎么样?

499
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:19,630
Why not?
为什么不?

500
01:25:51,705 --> 01:25:53,433
Come along, Falkon.
我们走吧，法拉肯

501
01:25:54,272 --> 01:25:55,238
Come on.
来吧
