1
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,868


2
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:45,867


3
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:46,866


4
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:49,863


5
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:51,861


6
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:52,860


7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,859


8
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,851


9
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,040
<i>Sonja.</i>

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,908
<i>You are suffering, Sonja...</i>

11
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,777
<i>but vengeance shall be yours.</i>

12
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,579
<i>Vengeance on Queen Gedren...</i>

13
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,838
<i>who wanted you for herself.</i>

14
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:07,478
<i>Your disgust was clear.</i>

15
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:16,273
<i>And so it was that Gedren</i> <i>ordered your family murdered...</i>

16
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:22,147
<i>your body violated by her soldiers.</i>

17
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:28,307
<i>But in your quest</i> <i>for justice and vengeance...</i>

18
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,876
<i>you will need great strength...</i>

19
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:37,210
<i>for your sword arm must have no equal.</i>

20
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,842
<i>L give you that strength.</i>

21
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:10,722


22
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,717


23
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:20,712


24
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:31,701


25
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,696


26
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,685


27
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:58,674


28
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:07,665


29
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:11,661


30
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,656


31
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,646


32
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:31,641


33
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:36,636


34
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:41,631


35
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:06,606


36
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:10,602


37
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:37,177
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?

38
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,703
He has not come, Highness.

39
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:43,105
He should be here for the destruction of the talisman.

40
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:48,270
But we cannot delay. We will proceed without him.

41
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,606
O God of the high Gods...

42
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:21,839
behold the talisman with which you created the world and all things.

43
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,571
O God of Gods...

44
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:35,038
it has become too powerful for us...

45
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:39,610
and we must destroy it before it destroys the world.

46
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,604
Forgive us now as we send it out of the light...

47
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,009
from which it draws its power...

48
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,379
into eternal darkness.

49
00:07:19,614 --> 00:07:20,977
Forgive us.

50
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:32,540
Come on.

51
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,503
So this can make worlds...

52
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:00,876
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.

53
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,340
Have it lifted out.

54
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,810
Lift it out!

55
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:40,674
Touch it.

56
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:41,274
So it is true. Only women may touch it.

57
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,043
The cover.

58
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,077
Take it out.

59
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:11,077
Great queen, what shall we do with the prisoners?

60
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,944
- No! - No!

61
00:12:50,614 --> 00:12:51,704
Come.

62
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,273
Horses.

63
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,909
The talisman's stolen.

64
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,808
Must destroy the talisman.

65
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:31,036
We must find my sister. Take me.

66
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:35,406
L know where she is. Please.

67
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,876
Magnificent.

68
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,611
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.

69
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:30,245
You are the master of the master.

70
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:33,639
Never have l seen your equal.

71
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,637
You must learn to like men a little better.

72
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,576
They are not all evil.

73
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,406
We must judge by our own experience, Grand Master.

74
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:59,638
L know.

75
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,609
But in life, all is not swordplay.

76
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:09,608
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman...

77
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,969
it could be your downfall.

78
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:17,235
L don't hate all men, Grand Master.

79
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:22,043
That would have been music to my ears 30 years ago.

80
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:23,904
Come.

81
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,041
A great swordsman must have a great sword.

82
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,206
Choose.

83
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:47,368
A gift from the Grand Master.

84
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,605
<i>Sonja.</i>

85
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,976
What is it, Red Sonja?

86
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,136
L'm looking for Red Sonja.

87
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,374
- I am Sonja. - Your sister's dying.

88
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,941
L'll take you to her.

89
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:54,504
Varna.

90
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,576
Thank God.

91
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:06,344
L've lived long enough.

92
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,043
The talisman's stolen.

93
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,672
All the priests massacred.

94
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,938
- We fought... - Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.

95
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,775
There's no time. Listen.

96
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,841
The talisman has terrible power...

97
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,069
which grows in the light.

98
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:36,007
In 13 days it could destroy the world...

99
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,969
by storm and earthquake.

100
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:51,170
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.

101
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:56,240
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.

102
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,940
L swear.

103
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,577
Who took it?

104
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:02,912
L don't know.

105
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,903
There was a woman with a gold mask.

106
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:10,173
Soldiers.

107
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:13,276
Where did they take it? North? South?

108
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,939
She's dead. And the living have work to do.

109
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:35,577
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.

110
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,675
- Who are you, anyway? - My name is Kalidor.

111
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,945
L befriended your sister, remember?

112
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,274
L'm a friend of yours, too.

113
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:50,244
L thank you for what you did for my sister. You will be rewarded.

114
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,172
L'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.

115
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,973
If l think somebody owes me something, l take it.

116
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:43,210
Someone is using the talisman.

117
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:49,272
- What place is that? - Hablok. It's a great city.

118
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,641
Where are you going?

119
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:58,972
Hablok.

120
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,702
Wait. L'll come with you.

121
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,612
Why should you? It's no business of yours.

122
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,605
And neither am I.

123
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,008
You may be wrong on both counts.

124
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,734
L know you're a brave girl, but danger is my trade.

125
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,070
Then l'll learn it by myself.

126
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,372
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.

127
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,204
L don't need any man's help.

128
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,205
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady! Can you do nothing right?

129
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,577
Still, you great idiot.

130
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:57,469
L'm trying, Your Highness.

131
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:02,611
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb, useless, selfish beast!

132
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,835
Quickly, come. Come to me.

133
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:08,842
Don't give me orders, slave. L'll have you hung by the heels.

134
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,170
Anyway, it's too slippery.

135
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:15,378
Do you want me to fall in that boiling mud? You numskull.

136
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,807
L'll try to swing it around. Now.

137
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,577
- Hold still, boy. - Boy?

138
00:24:25,913 --> 00:24:28,811
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.

139
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,869
Jump off. Jump.

140
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,873
What about me?

141
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:56,673
Get back here and stop playing the fool.

142
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,873
L hear and obey, master of the world. L'm coming.

143
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:33,140
Lucky for you that this person came along.

144
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,402
Reward her, and tell her who l am.

145
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:42,535
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn, Great Lord of Hablok...

146
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,942
keeper of the spotless throne...

147
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,535
great elephant who fertilizes the world with his...

148
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,841
l've told you not to say that.

149
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:53,806
Do it again, and l'll have you impaled.

150
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:58,273
Well, reward her, fool.

151
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:13,409
From the look of your kingdom, Prince, you need this more than l do.

152
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:18,973
Did she address me?

153
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,034
What happened?

154
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:25,005
Queen Gedren attacked us is what happened.

155
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:28,011
Gedren? Queen Gedren?

156
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,877
That's right.

157
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:35,078
She knocked down half the city with her new weapon and demanded our surrender.

158
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:36,771
My army ran away.

159
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:39,605
Do they want to live forever?

160
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,803
L refused to surrender.

161
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,867
So she knocked down the other half.

162
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:49,272
Falkon, since everyone is dead or run away...

163
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,304
you shall escort me to the mountains tomorrow.

164
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:54,311
L shall raise a new army...

165
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,777
and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.

166
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:01,206
Where can l find her, this Queen Gedren?

167
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:04,172
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.

168
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:05,576
How do l get there?

169
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:09,669
There's a long scenic way, and there's the short way through Brytag's toll road.

170
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:12,836
L'll take Brytag's toll road. Which way is that?

171
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,877
Straight north from here. You can't miss it.

172
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:19,774
But it's worth a try.

173
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:24,677
Ask the woman if she wishes to join my army.

174
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,337
We'll probably need a cook.

175
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,604
Your Highness is too kind, but l travel alone.

176
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:35,809
Dismiss the woman, Falkon. L shall dine in an hour.

177
00:27:41,945 --> 00:27:44,275
May l give you a word of advice?

178
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:47,811
Put him over your knee and beat some manners into him.

179
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:52,471
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth, would you?

180
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,868
Brytag, come down and open the gate.

181
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,107
Not so fast, redhead.

182
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:54,976
L'm up here where l can get a better look at you.

183
00:28:55,045 --> 00:28:57,375
L have no time to waste, Brytag.

184
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,943
L have plenty. Come up, l say.

185
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:50,542
- Come here, wench. - Why should I?

186
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,441
Because l am Brytag. This is my land.

187
00:29:58,512 --> 00:30:01,069
All that pass through pay me tribute.

188
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:03,838
- How much, Brytag? - Who mentioned money?

189
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:06,336
Tribute, l said.

190
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:09,535
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.

191
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:20,935
Suppose l don't.

192
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:25,176
Suppose, instead, l open up that great fat belly of yours.

193
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:31,101
You hear that?

194
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:34,011
She's going to open up my great...

195
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:39,970
Woman, l have fought 177 men.

196
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:43,212
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.

197
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,873
You dare to mock at Brytag?

198
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,541
That takes no daring.

199
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:56,167
But when l've killed you, will your warriors let me go unharmed?

200
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:58,771
When you've killed me?

201
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:05,402
When this wench has killed me, you will let her go unharmed, won't you?

202
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:06,902
Aye.

203
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:13,735
See?

204
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:18,708
So, wench.

205
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:26,169
L'm gonna feed your eyes to the birds, red hair.

206
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:28,310
L don't need eyes to find you.

207
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:30,867
L can smell you at a hundred paces.

208
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:24,105
L will tell the future in your entrails, red woman.

209
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:27,310
L know my future. You have none.

210
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:19,101
Hold on, Sonja.

211
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:29,501
Sonja, come on.

212
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:49,173
Look out!

213
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:12,406
This way. Follow me!

214
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,709
- Get away. Go! - What about you?

215
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:17,539
L can hold them. Go!

216
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,041
Hurry! Stop them!

217
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,573
Release me, ruffian!

218
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:01,471
Release me, l say!

219
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:05,671
- Tell us where it is. - L'll have your head for this!

220
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,211
Don't be shy.

221
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:12,042
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?

222
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:14,768
There is no gold, ruffian.

223
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:22,804
L tell you, l have no gold!

224
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:28,409
You have fine raiment, boy, almost as resplendent as mine.

225
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,808
And you expect me to believe you're penniless?

226
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:36,107
L'll have you know, villain, l am Prince Tarn of Hablok.

227
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:39,967
My subjects will see to your punishment for this.

228
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:44,637
And a grievous punishment it will be, impertinent oaf!

229
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,367
Your subjects?

230
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,007
My kingdom is greater than yours.

231
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,045
And l have but four.

232
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:55,472
Pull him!

233
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:05,836
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty? - Yes, clumsy oaf.

234
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:08,708
Why did you leave him?

235
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,177
We needed food. L went hunting.

236
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:13,370
You could have taken him with you.

237
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:16,468
Tell her, Falkon, that l don't care for hunting.

238
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:20,670
He doesn't care for hunting.

239
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:54,038
Treasure to the vaults, prisoners to the dungeons.

240
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:57,743
Take the talisman back to the Chamber of Lights.

241
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,573
Very well, my queen.

242
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:33,502
Perhaps fewer candles...

243
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:36,174
would be advisable, Your Majesty.

244
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:37,735
Why?

245
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:41,377
The stronger the light, the greater the power of the talisman grows.

246
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,536
L want more light here, not less.

247
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:47,305
But it is dangerously powerful already, great queen.

248
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:51,743
- Look what it did to Hablok. - Yes. Very satisfying.

249
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:56,435
But l want its full power when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.

250
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:57,943
Its full power.

251
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:01,239
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty. - Majesty!

252
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:04,038
Enemies are approaching the outer empire.

253
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,634
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty...

254
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,644
with his army.

255
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:49,004
Insects.

256
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,973
That girl.

257
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:00,942
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.

258
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:06,769
Ikol, l want her alive without so much as a scratch on her skin.

259
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:10,036
Shall l send out a small ambush party?

260
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:13,434
No.

261
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,273
We'll wait till they get a little closer.

262
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:37,804
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.

263
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:40,933
Falkon, proclaim my arrival...

264
00:42:41,078 --> 00:42:43,601
and the defiance of Queen Gedren.

265
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:45,672
Sound your trumpet.

266
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:47,938
Keep quiet...

267
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:51,102
at least till we find a way across.

268
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:55,110
Princes do not sneak in on their enemies like thieves.

269
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:58,540
You don't know much about princes, do you?

270
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:29,773
You wait here with the horses.

271
00:43:31,144 --> 00:43:34,008
L want to test this bridge first.

272
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,271
Or whatever it is.

273
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,707
It looks safe enough. We'll lead the horses across.

274
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:23,834
Now hear me, Gedren!

275
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,605
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...

276
00:44:26,678 --> 00:44:30,303
to revenge myself on the tyrant of Burkubane.

277
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:34,333
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.

278
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:36,939
How dare you, woman?

279
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:38,943
L'll show you how l dare.

280
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:41,534
This should have been done long ago.

281
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:45,242
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.

282
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,504
You're not worth the effort, boy.

283
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,669
Boy?

284
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:55,540
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...

285
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:59,203
till you learn gratitude and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.

286
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:01,036
He's a real man.

287
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:12,704
She didn't mean it, my prince. She doesn't know your fine qualities.

288
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:32,272
Take that, ruffian.

289
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:48,143
Take that, you ruffian.

290
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:05,140
Practicing, Highness?

291
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:09,036
L thought princes did everything so well, they wouldn't need to.

292
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:12,272
L was disarmed by those ruffians the other day.

293
00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:15,470
L noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.

294
00:46:15,911 --> 00:46:18,207
L am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.

295
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,371
Come on!

296
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:31,739
You're meant to be using your sword. Remember?

297
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:41,037
Simple, isn't it?

298
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:43,738
But it's not in the rule book.

299
00:46:43,811 --> 00:46:47,073
You see, fencing and fighting are two different things.

300
00:46:47,578 --> 00:46:49,736
You need to learn them both.

301
00:47:01,178 --> 00:47:05,201
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?

302
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:08,334
If you please?

303
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:14,872
Spoken like a prince.

304
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:22,936
You were disarmed because you hold the hilt too tight.

305
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,144
Grip gently. See?

306
00:47:28,944 --> 00:47:31,308
Gently. L see. Like this?

307
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:35,001
Your Highness learns fast.

308
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:39,469
L think we'll continue your fencing lessons another time.

309
00:47:40,844 --> 00:47:42,639
We've an early start.

310
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:44,973
You are very beautiful.

311
00:47:45,044 --> 00:47:48,601
When l am king of Hablok, l shall have you at my court.

312
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,840
You will? My, the honor.

313
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,473
L may even make you my queen.

314
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:58,036
But l'm still young.

315
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:00,374
We shall have to see.

316
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:36,269
They will reach the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.

317
00:48:36,345 --> 00:48:39,140
We must force them to take shelter there.

318
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,503
The killing machine will do the rest.

319
00:48:42,577 --> 00:48:45,009
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.

320
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:48,271
But not the girl.

321
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:52,271
L want that beauty here with me. See to it that she is spared.

322
00:48:53,677 --> 00:48:56,541
L'll do my best, my queen.

323
00:48:57,078 --> 00:49:00,101
The machine is difficult to control.

324
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:03,666
One cannot guarantee that something will not go wrong.

325
00:49:05,477 --> 00:49:08,773
If it does, you will be its next victim.

326
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:24,875
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.

327
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:27,808
A little one.

328
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:41,776
We should be out in the storm.

329
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,800
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?

330
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:49,038
L haven't got time to shelter. L've four days left to find the talisman.

331
00:49:51,477 --> 00:49:54,103
Besides, something drove us in here...

332
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:56,240
every bit of the way.

333
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,203
L noticed it, but l'm not complaining.

334
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:04,976
Where's Tarn?

335
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,772
He promised not to wander. Dry off, l'll go find him.

336
00:50:15,944 --> 00:50:17,432
Look at this.

337
00:50:24,178 --> 00:50:26,666
It must be the biggest in the world.

338
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:35,167
Could be fake. There's a lot of bad stuff around.

339
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:37,802
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...

340
00:50:37,878 --> 00:50:41,003
fill its treasury, buy me an army.

341
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:43,208
Dig it out!

342
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:46,176
Your Highness, it may belong to somebody.

343
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:49,209
It does, and he wants it now!

344
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:51,736
Yeah.

345
00:50:58,377 --> 00:51:00,276
Use your dagger, fool!

346
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:22,842
What are you doing?

347
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:25,638
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!

348
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:29,575
Come on. Put your back into it.

349
00:51:30,078 --> 00:51:33,272
It won't budge. Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.

350
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:36,634
The water is rising. You must get out of here.

351
00:51:47,178 --> 00:51:50,269
- This way! Make for the stairs! - Come, my prince!

352
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,669
- Get out of the water! - Yes.

353
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:28,002
Climb up here, my prince.

354
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:02,502
Tarn!

355
00:53:03,911 --> 00:53:05,774
L'm coming, my prince!

356
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:17,004
Let go!

357
00:53:46,011 --> 00:53:47,476
Where is she?

358
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,674
L can't kill it! It's a machine!

359
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:49,369
Sonja, we have to blind it!

360
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:52,372
It's our only chance!

361
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,469
Falkon, get out! It can't see!

362
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,967
There. Keep it covered.

363
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:18,934
Why have you been following me?

364
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,476
To see that you reach the talisman safely.

365
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:22,703
Why?

366
00:57:23,043 --> 00:57:26,203
L have to be sure that the talisman is destroyed.

367
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:29,299
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

368
00:57:29,377 --> 00:57:32,309
had entrusted the talisman to the priestesses...

369
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:34,741
because only women may touch it.

370
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,134
But to guard it, or to destroy it if need be...

371
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:41,199
is still the duty of the High Lord.

372
00:57:41,377 --> 00:57:43,434
You? The High Lord?

373
00:57:45,277 --> 00:57:48,573
L was coming to the temple to see the talisman destroyed...

374
00:57:48,644 --> 00:57:50,939
when l found your sister dying...

375
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,636
and learnt that the talisman had been stolen.

376
00:57:54,244 --> 00:57:56,107
So she guided me to you.

377
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:58,700
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

378
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,768
You didn't seem to want a man's help.

379
00:58:02,844 --> 00:58:05,934
But you needed it, so that's why l followed you.

380
00:58:06,544 --> 00:58:09,374
L had to be sure you reached the talisman.

381
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,369
L see.

382
00:58:12,444 --> 00:58:15,638
L misunderstood. L thought you had another reason.

383
00:58:23,477 --> 00:58:24,670
L did.

384
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,507
No. L'm under a vow.

385
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:44,304
No man may have me unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.

386
00:58:49,644 --> 00:58:53,770
So the only man that can have you is one who has tried to kill you.

387
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:57,543
That's logic.

388
00:59:25,777 --> 00:59:29,675
If you yield only to a conqueror, then prepare to be conquered.

389
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,771
Don't be a fool. L don't want to kill you.

390
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,603
Try it.

391
00:59:54,943 --> 00:59:56,204
Come on.

392
01:00:05,677 --> 01:00:08,370
Keep it down over there. We're trying to sleep.

393
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:30,537
Are you all right?

394
01:00:30,776 --> 01:00:33,765
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.

395
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:36,503
Then let me down!

396
01:00:43,877 --> 01:00:45,207
Thank you.

397
01:02:08,377 --> 01:02:10,468
Why does she fight so hard?

398
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:13,043
She doesn't want to win.

399
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:55,741
Gedren's army. Another kingdom enslaved.

400
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:27,675
The talisman! We must find a way in.

401
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,138
We'll have to climb.

402
01:04:47,477 --> 01:04:49,466
Three of us should go in.

403
01:04:49,543 --> 01:04:53,169
Who'll stand guard this doorway, the post of danger?

404
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,100
- Falkon? - Me? Here?

405
01:04:56,177 --> 01:04:59,109
L don't know what's coming out that door. No, l am going up.

406
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:00,370
Coward!

407
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:02,904
L'll take my chances in there.

408
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,105
And l have to go in.

409
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:18,240
L'll stay.

410
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,399
Take care, Your Highness.

411
01:05:44,977 --> 01:05:46,273
Thank you.

412
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,633
Tomorrow, l start my diet.

413
01:07:15,443 --> 01:07:18,171
Majesty, the talisman is almost beyond control.

414
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:20,801
We must bury it in the dark before it is too late!

415
01:07:20,877 --> 01:07:24,673
It'll be buried when l have no further use for it, and that time is not yet.

416
01:07:24,743 --> 01:07:28,641
But it will kill us all! O God, Majesty, what do you want?

417
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:32,466
Our vaults are brimming with gold. Great states live in terror of us!

418
01:07:32,543 --> 01:07:35,135
- What more is there? - The world, Ikol!

419
01:07:35,443 --> 01:07:38,637
Today we took another piece of the city of Toktyl.

420
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:42,403
But l have wider claims and the talisman will enforce them!

421
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,068
Madness. There will be no world.

422
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,836
There will be no world.

423
01:08:49,476 --> 01:08:53,374
We must find the talisman. Only l can touch it, remember.

424
01:08:54,743 --> 01:08:58,971
You take that way, l'll go the other way. Falkon, you take the center.

425
01:09:10,443 --> 01:09:12,500
How's the food around here?

426
01:09:13,543 --> 01:09:14,907
Who are you?

427
01:10:22,443 --> 01:10:24,966
- Look for the talisman. - Yeah. Right.

428
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:49,175
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider. - You.

429
01:10:49,243 --> 01:10:51,766
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:

430
01:10:51,843 --> 01:10:55,172
The city you blasted with your filthy sorcery.

431
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:02,042
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.

432
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:04,638
Out of my way, child.

433
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,667
So that you can desert, like the thief you are?

434
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:11,667
With my gold?

435
01:11:12,509 --> 01:11:13,998
Hablok's gold?

436
01:11:20,077 --> 01:11:23,634
Now that was unmannerly of Your Highness...

437
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:27,732
and rude little boys need correction...

438
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:31,236
if they're going to grow up into...

439
01:11:39,443 --> 01:11:43,205
l'm afraid Your Highness' growth is going to be stunted permanently.

440
01:11:48,243 --> 01:11:51,573
Now, yield, Black Spider.

441
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,805
Where's Queen Gedren?

442
01:12:41,877 --> 01:12:44,741
She's gone. L'm so glad that you've come.

443
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:50,366
Please, will you protect me? L'm so frightened.

444
01:13:03,543 --> 01:13:06,907
Gedren! Where are you?

445
01:13:09,109 --> 01:13:13,235
So the Prince of Hablok honors us with his presence unwisely.

446
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:18,065
How many are with you? Tell me! How many are with you?

447
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:21,707
- How many? - Enough, Gedren!

448
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:29,500
Get back, or Hablok will need an heir to the throne.

449
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:31,599
And your own throne, Gedren.

450
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:35,631
Unless the talisman goes into the dark, your whole kingdom will...

451
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:42,338
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.

452
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:46,139
There's a way behind the throne.

453
01:13:47,776 --> 01:13:50,037
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!

454
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:54,635
You are a fool. We could have ruled the world together.

455
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:59,267
Now l shall rule alone, and you will die for what you did to me.

456
01:13:59,343 --> 01:14:00,775
What l did?

457
01:14:01,243 --> 01:14:04,107
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.

458
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:06,734
My brother, my sister!

459
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,704
Vermin! What were their lives compared to this?

460
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:14,333
You are mad! The talisman will destroy you.

461
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,303
Up here, Sonja.

462
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:18,504
Up here.

463
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:35,508
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!

464
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:05,965
Down this hallway!

465
01:18:18,643 --> 01:18:20,767
Sonja. Over here.

466
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,531
Falkon, help.

467
01:18:50,243 --> 01:18:51,731
Prince Tarn, come back.

468
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:55,367
L am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.

469
01:19:23,976 --> 01:19:25,737
Sonja, help me!

470
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:27,508
L'm trapped!

471
01:19:32,376 --> 01:19:35,365
Sonja! Behind you!

472
01:20:48,842 --> 01:20:50,603
L can't get through.

473
01:20:53,443 --> 01:20:56,409
Falkon, pull her through. L'll hold the gate.

474
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:01,339
Follow me. This is the way out.

475
01:22:08,609 --> 01:22:10,132
How do you know, Highness?

476
01:22:10,209 --> 01:22:12,902
Because this is the way l came in, you clown.

477
01:22:24,809 --> 01:22:26,604
Here's the way through.

478
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,073
Go. Quickly!

479
01:22:52,276 --> 01:22:53,605
The door doesn't move.

480
01:22:53,675 --> 01:22:54,936
How does it open?

481
01:22:55,009 --> 01:22:56,907
L know. Leave it to me.

482
01:22:57,842 --> 01:22:59,705
No! Come back, Prince!

483
01:23:11,842 --> 01:23:13,308
He's done it.

484
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:16,830
We can't leave him. Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.

485
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:23,507
Save yourselves! Run for it!

486
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:26,269
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!

487
01:23:26,575 --> 01:23:28,666
Run! Run for it!

488
01:23:28,742 --> 01:23:31,469
L'm not leaving here without you, my prince.

489
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:37,031
Give me your hand. Reach. L'll get you out.

490
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:49,404
Hablok is over there.

491
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:52,575
When it's rebuilt, you must come to visit us.

492
01:24:52,809 --> 01:24:55,207
L'm sure to need a queen someday.

493
01:24:55,276 --> 01:24:56,866
You'll find one.

494
01:24:57,109 --> 01:25:00,269
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.

495
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:05,433
L make it a rule never to take a woman unless she can beat me in a fair fight.

496
01:25:06,009 --> 01:25:09,134
That's a challenge l might think about someday.

497
01:25:09,909 --> 01:25:11,704
