1
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:34,970
<i>Sonja. </i>

2
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,839
<i>You are suffering, Sonja... </i>

3
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:56,707
<i>but vengeance shall be yours. </i>

4
00:01:57,044 --> 00:01:59,510
<i>Vengeance on Queen Gedren... </i>

5
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,768
<i>who wanted you for herself. </i>

6
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:07,410
<i>Your disgust was clear. </i>

7
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:16,204
<i>And so it was that Gedren</i>
<i>ordered your farnily rnurdered... </i>

8
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:22,077
<i>your body violated by her soldiers. </i>

9
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:28,238
<i>But in your quest</i>
<i>for justice and vengeance... </i>

10
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,806
<i>you will need great strength... </i>

11
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:37,140
<i>for your sword arrn rnust have no equal. </i>

12
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:41,773
<i>I give you that strength. </i>

13
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:37,108
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?

14
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:39,633
He has not come, Highness.

15
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,036
He should be here
for the destruction of the talisman.

16
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:48,201
But we cannot delay.
We will proceed without him.

17
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,536
O God of the high Gods...

18
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:21,769
behold the talisman with which
you created the world and all things.

19
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,501
O God of Gods...

20
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,970
it has become too powerful for us...

21
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:39,540
and we must destroy it
before it destroys the world.

22
00:06:57,011 --> 00:07:00,534
Forgive us now
as we send it out of the light...

23
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:02,941
from which it draws its power...

24
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:06,309
into eternal darkness.

25
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:20,908
Forgive us.

26
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:32,471
Come on.

27
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,433
So this can make worlds...

28
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,808
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.

29
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,270
Have it lifted out.

30
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:06,742
Lift it out!

31
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,605
Touch it.

32
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:41,205
So it is true. Only women may touch it.

33
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:44,974
The cover.

34
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,008
Take it out.

35
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,007
Great queen,
what shall we do with the prisoners?

36
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,876
- No!
- No!

37
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:51,635
Come.

38
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,203
Horses.

39
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,840
The talisman's stolen.

40
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,739
Must destroy the talisman.

41
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,966
We must find my sister. Take me.

42
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:35,336
I know where she is. Please.

43
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,807
Magnificent.

44
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:23,542
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.

45
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:30,176
You are the master of the master.

46
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:33,570
Never have I seen your equal.

47
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,568
You must learn to like men a little better.

48
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,507
They are not all evil.

49
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:58,337
We must judge by our own experience,
Grand Master.

50
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,569
I know.

51
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,541
But in life, all is not swordplay.

52
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,539
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman...

53
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,899
it could be your downfall.

54
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:17,165
I don't hate all men, Grand Master.

55
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:21,973
That would have been music to my ears
30 years ago.

56
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:23,834
Come.

57
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,972
A great swordsman
must have a great sword.

58
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:44,136
Choose.

59
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:47,299
A gift from the Grand Master.

60
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:00,536
<i>Sonja. </i>

61
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,906
What is it, Red Sonja?

62
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:36,066
I'm looking for Red Sonja.

63
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,305
- I am Sonja.
- Your sister's dying.

64
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,871
I'll take you to her.

65
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,435
Varna.

66
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:03,507
Thank God.

67
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,275
I've lived long enough.

68
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,973
The talisman's stolen.

69
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,602
All the priests massacred.

70
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:17,868
- We fought...
- Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.

71
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,705
There's no time. Listen.

72
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,771
The talisman has terrible power...

73
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,999
which grows in the light.

74
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,938
In 13 days it could destroy the world...

75
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,899
by storm and earthquake.

76
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:51,101
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.

77
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:56,171
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.

78
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:57,870
I swear.

79
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,507
Who took it?

80
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:02,842
I don't know.

81
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,833
There was a woman with a gold mask.

82
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:10,104
Soldiers.

83
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,208
Where did they take it? North? South?

84
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,869
She's dead.
And the living have work to do.

85
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:35,507
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.

86
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,605
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name is Kalidor.

87
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,875
I befriended your sister, remember?

88
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,205
I'm a friend of yours, too.

89
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:50,175
I thank you for what you did for my sister.
You will be rewarded.

90
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.

91
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:56,903
If I think somebody owes me something,
I take it.

92
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,142
Someone is using the talisman.

93
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:49,203
- What place is that?
- Hablok. It's a great city.

94
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,571
Where are you going?

95
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,903
Hablok.

96
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,633
Wait. I'll come with you.

97
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,542
Why should you? It's no business of yours.

98
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,535
And neither am I.

99
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,940
You may be wrong on both counts.

100
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,664
I know you're a brave girl,
but danger is my trade.

101
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,001
Then I'll learn it by myself.

102
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,303
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.

103
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,135
I don't need any man's help.

104
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,136
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady!
Can you do nothing right?

105
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,508
Still, you great idiot.

106
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,399
I'm trying, Your Highness.

107
00:23:58,643 --> 00:24:02,541
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb,
useless, selfish beast!

108
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,765
Quickly, come. Come to me.

109
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,773
Don't give me orders, slave.
I'll have you hung by the heels.

110
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,101
Anyway, it's too slippery.

111
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:15,308
Do you want me to fall
in that boiling mud? You numskull.

112
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,737
I'll try to swing it around. Now.

113
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,507
- Hold still, boy.
- Boy?

114
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,741
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.

115
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:49,799
Jump off. Jump.

116
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,804
What about me?

117
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:56,603
Get back here and stop playing the fool.

118
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:00,803
I hear and obey, master of the world.
I'm coming.

119
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:33,071
Lucky for you that this person came along.

120
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,332
Reward her, and tell her who I am.

121
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:42,465
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn,
Great Lord of Hablok...

122
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,873
keeper of the spotless throne...

123
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:48,465
great elephant who fertilizes the world
with his...

124
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:50,771
I've told you not to say that.

125
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,736
Do it again, and I'll have you impaled.

126
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:58,204
Well, reward her, fool.

127
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:13,339
From the look of your kingdom, Prince,
you need this more than I do.

128
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,904
Did she address me?

129
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:21,965
What happened?

130
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:24,937
Queen Gedren attacked us
is what happened.

131
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,942
Gedren? Queen Gedren?

132
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:29,809
That's right.

133
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:35,009
She knocked down half the city with her
new weapon and demanded our surrender.

134
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:36,702
My army ran away.

135
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,535
Do they want to live forever?

136
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,735
I refused to surrender.

137
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,798
So she knocked down the other half.

138
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:49,202
Falkon, since everyone is dead
or run away...

139
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,235
you shall escort me
to the mountains tomorrow.

140
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,241
I shall raise a new army...

141
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,707
and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.

142
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,136
Where can I find her, this Queen Gedren?

143
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:04,103
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.

144
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:05,506
How do I get there?

145
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:09,599
There's a long scenic way, and there's
the short way through Brytag's toll road.

146
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:12,767
I'll take Brytag's toll road.
Which way is that?

147
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,808
Straight north from here.
You can't miss it.

148
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,705
But it's worth a try.

149
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,608
Ask the woman
if she wishes to join my army.

150
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,267
We'll probably need a cook.

151
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,534
Your Highness is too kind,
but I travel alone.

152
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,740
Dismiss the woman, Falkon.
I shall dine in an hour.

153
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,205
May I give you a word of advice?

154
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,742
Put him over your knee
and beat some manners into him.

155
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,401
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth,
would you?

156
00:28:46,276 --> 00:28:48,799
Brytag, come down and open the gate.

157
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:51,038
Not so fast, redhead.

158
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,907
I'm up here
where I can get a better look at you.

159
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,306
I have no time to waste, Brytag.

160
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:00,875
I have plenty. Come up, I say.

161
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:50,472
- Come here, wench.
- Why should I?

162
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:57,371
Because I am Brytag. This is my land.

163
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:01,000
All that pass through pay me tribute.

164
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:03,770
- How much, Brytag?
- Who mentioned money?

165
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:06,266
Tribute, I said.

166
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:09,465
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.

167
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:20,866
Suppose I don't.

168
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:25,107
Suppose, instead, I open up
that great fat belly of yours.

169
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,031
You hear that?

170
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,941
She's going to open up my great...

171
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,900
Woman, I have fought 177 men.

172
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:43,142
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.

173
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:45,804
You dare to mock at Brytag?

174
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:48,471
That takes no daring.

175
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:56,097
But when I've killed you,
will your warriors let me go unharmed?

176
00:30:56,509 --> 00:30:58,702
When you've killed me?

177
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:05,332
When this wench has killed me,
you will let her go unharmed, won't you?

178
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:06,833
Aye.

179
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,667
See?

180
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,639
So, wench.

181
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:26,099
I'm gonna feed your eyes
to the birds, red hair.

182
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,241
I don't need eyes to find you.

183
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:30,798
I can smell you at a hundred paces.

184
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,035
I will tell the future in your entrails,
red woman.

185
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:27,240
I know my future. You have none.

186
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,031
Hold on, Sonja.

187
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,432
Sonja, come on.

188
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,103
Look out!

189
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:12,337
This way. Follow me!

190
00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:15,640
- Get away. Go!
- What about you?

191
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:17,471
I can hold them. Go!

192
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,971
Hurry! Stop them!

193
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,504
Release me, ruffian!

194
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,402
Release me, I say!

195
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:05,602
- Tell us where it is.
- I'll have your head for this!

196
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:07,141
Don't be shy.

197
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:11,972
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?

198
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,698
There is no gold, ruffian.

199
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:22,734
I tell you, I have no gold!

200
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:28,341
You have fine raiment, boy,
almost as resplendent as mine.

201
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:31,738
And you expect me to believe
you're penniless?

202
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:36,037
I'll have you know, villain,
I am Prince Tarn of Hablok.

203
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:39,897
My subjects will see
to your punishment for this.

204
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:44,568
And a grievous punishment it will be,
impertinent oaf!

205
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,298
Your subjects?

206
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,937
My kingdom is greater than yours.

207
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,975
And I have but four.

208
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:55,403
Pull him!

209
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:05,766
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty?
- Yes, clumsy oaf.

210
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:08,638
Why did you leave him?

211
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:11,108
We needed food. I went hunting.

212
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:13,301
You could have taken him with you.

213
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:16,399
Tell her, Falkon,
that I don't care for hunting.

214
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:20,600
He doesn't care for hunting.

215
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,968
Treasure to the vaults,
prisoners to the dungeons.

216
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:57,673
Take the talisman back
to the Chamber of Lights.

217
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,503
Very well, my queen.

218
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,432
Perhaps fewer candles...

219
00:39:33,775 --> 00:39:36,105
would be advisable, Your Majesty.

220
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:37,666
Why?

221
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,308
The stronger the light, the greater
the power of the talisman grows.

222
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,466
I want more light here, not less.

223
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:47,236
But it is dangerously powerful already,
great queen.

224
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:51,673
- Look what it did to Hablok.
- Yes. Very satisfying.

225
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:56,365
But I want its full power
when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.

226
00:39:56,442 --> 00:39:57,874
Its full power.

227
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:01,170
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty.
- Majesty!

228
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:03,970
Enemies are approaching
the outer empire.

229
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:45,564
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty...

230
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:47,574
with his army.

231
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:48,936
Insects.

232
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:54,905
That girl.

233
00:41:57,475 --> 00:42:00,873
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.

234
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:06,699
Ikol, I want her alive
without so much as a scratch on her skin.

235
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,968
Shall I send out a small ambush party?

236
00:42:12,342 --> 00:42:13,365
No.

237
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,204
We'll wait till they get a little closer.

238
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:37,735
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.

239
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:40,864
Falkon, proclaim my arrival...

240
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:43,531
and the defiance of Queen Gedren.

241
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,602
Sound your trumpet.

242
00:42:46,142 --> 00:42:47,869
Keep quiet...

243
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:51,034
at least till we find a way across.

244
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,041
Princes do not sneak in
on their enemies like thieves.

245
00:42:55,675 --> 00:42:58,470
You don't know
much about princes, do you?

246
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:29,703
You wait here with the horses.

247
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:33,940
I want to test this bridge first.

248
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:36,201
Or whatever it is.

249
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:18,637
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.

250
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,765
Now hear me, Gedren!

251
00:44:23,842 --> 00:44:26,535
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...

252
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:30,234
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of Burkubane.

253
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:34,263
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.

254
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,871
How dare you, woman?

255
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:38,874
I'll show you how I dare.

256
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,464
This should have been done long ago.

257
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:45,172
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.

258
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:50,434
You're not worth the effort, boy.

259
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:52,599
Boy?

260
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:55,470
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...

261
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:59,133
till you learn gratitude
and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.

262
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:00,968
He's a real man.

263
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:12,636
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.

264
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,202
Take that, ruffian.

265
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,073
Take that, you ruffian.

266
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:05,071
Practicing, Highness?

267
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:08,967
I thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.

268
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,202
I was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.

269
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:15,400
I noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.

270
00:46:15,842 --> 00:46:18,137
I am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.

271
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:20,302
Come on!

272
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:31,670
You're meant to be
using your sword. Remember?

273
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:40,967
Simple, isn't it?

274
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:43,670
But it's not in the rule book.

275
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:47,003
You see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.

276
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:49,667
You need to learn them both.

277
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:05,131
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?

278
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:08,264
If you please?

279
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,803
Spoken like a prince.

280
00:47:19,242 --> 00:47:22,868
You were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.

281
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:25,074
Grip gently. See?

282
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,238
Gently. I see. Like this?

283
00:47:32,908 --> 00:47:34,931
Your Highness learns fast.

284
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:39,399
I think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.

285
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,570
We've an early start.

286
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:44,903
You are very beautiful.

287
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:48,533
When I am king of Hablok,
I shall have you at my court.

288
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:51,772
You will? My, the honor.

289
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:55,403
I may even make you my queen.

290
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:57,966
But I'm still young.

291
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,304
We shall have to see.

292
00:48:33,075 --> 00:48:36,200
They will reach
the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.

293
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:39,070
We must force them to take shelter there.

294
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:42,434
The killing machine will do the rest.

295
00:48:42,508 --> 00:48:44,939
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.

296
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,201
But not the girl.

297
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:52,201
I want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.

298
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:56,473
I'll do my best, my queen.

299
00:48:57,008 --> 00:49:00,031
The machine is difficult to control.

300
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:03,597
One cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.

301
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:08,704
If it does, you will be its next victim.

302
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:24,805
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.

303
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:27,740
A little one.

304
00:49:39,774 --> 00:49:41,707
We should be out in the storm.

305
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:44,731
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?

306
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:48,968
I haven't got time to shelter.
I've four days left to find the talisman.

307
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:54,033
Besides, something drove us in here...

308
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,170
every bit of the way.

309
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:00,133
I noticed it, but I'm not complaining.

310
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:04,906
Where's Tarn?

311
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:09,704
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, I'll go find him.

312
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:17,363
Look at this.

313
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:26,597
It must be the biggest in the world.

314
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:35,098
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.

315
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:37,732
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...

316
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:40,933
fill its treasury, buy me an army.

317
00:50:41,808 --> 00:50:43,138
Dig it out!

318
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,106
Your Highness,
it may belong to somebody.

319
00:50:46,741 --> 00:50:49,139
It does, and he wants it now!

320
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:51,667
Yeah.

321
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,206
Use your dagger, fool!

322
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,772
What are you doing?

323
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:25,569
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!

324
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,507
Come on. Put your back into it.

325
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:33,202
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.

326
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:36,565
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.

327
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:50,199
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!

328
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:23,601
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.

329
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:27,932
Climb up here, my prince.

330
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:02,433
Tarn!

331
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:05,704
I'm coming, my prince!

332
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:16,934
Let go!

333
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:47,407
Where is she?

334
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,605
I can't kill it! It's a machine!

335
00:55:47,175 --> 00:55:49,300
Sonja, we have to blind it!

336
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:52,303
It's our only chance!

337
00:56:21,808 --> 00:56:24,399
Falkon, get out! It can't see!

338
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:14,899
There. Keep it covered.

339
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:18,864
Why have you been following me?

340
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:21,406
To see that you reach the talisman safely.

341
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,633
Why?

342
00:57:22,975 --> 00:57:26,135
I have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.

343
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:29,230
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

344
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:32,240
had entrusted the talisman
to the priestesses...

345
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:34,671
because only women may touch it.

346
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:38,065
But to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...

347
00:57:38,641 --> 00:57:41,130
is still the duty of the High Lord.

348
00:57:41,307 --> 00:57:43,364
You? The High Lord?

349
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:48,503
I was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...

350
00:57:48,574 --> 00:57:50,870
when I found your sister dying...

351
00:57:50,941 --> 00:57:53,566
and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.

352
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,038
So she guided me to you.

353
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:58,630
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

354
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:02,698
You didn't seem to want a man's help.

355
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:05,865
But you needed it,
so that's why I followed you.

356
00:58:06,474 --> 00:58:09,304
I had to be sure you reached the talisman.

357
00:58:10,141 --> 00:58:11,299
I see.

358
00:58:12,374 --> 00:58:15,568
I misunderstood.
I thought you had another reason.

359
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:24,600
I did.

360
00:58:34,608 --> 00:58:37,438
No. I'm under a vow.

361
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:44,235
No man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.

362
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:53,700
So the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.

363
00:58:56,008 --> 00:58:57,473
That's logic.

364
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:29,606
If you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.

365
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:44,701
Don't be a fool. I don't want to kill you.

366
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:46,534
Try it.

367
00:59:54,874 --> 00:59:56,135
Come on.

368
01:00:05,608 --> 01:00:08,301
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.

369
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:30,467
Are you all right?

370
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,697
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.

371
01:00:34,808 --> 01:00:36,433
Then let me down!

372
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,137
Thank you.

373
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,398
Why does she fight so hard?

374
01:02:11,008 --> 01:02:12,974
She doesn't want to win.

375
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:55,672
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.

376
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,606
The talisman! We must find a way in.

377
01:04:41,307 --> 01:04:43,068
We'll have to climb.

378
01:04:47,407 --> 01:04:49,396
Three of us should go in.

379
01:04:49,474 --> 01:04:53,099
Who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?

380
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:56,031
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?

381
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:59,039
I don't know what's coming out that door.
No, I am going up.

382
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:00,300
Coward!

383
01:05:00,608 --> 01:05:02,836
I'll take my chances in there.

384
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:05,036
And I have to go in.

385
01:05:16,841 --> 01:05:18,170
I'll stay.

386
01:05:26,341 --> 01:05:28,330
Take care, Your Highness.

387
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,203
Thank you.

388
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:10,564
Tomorrow, I start my diet.

389
01:07:15,374 --> 01:07:18,101
Majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.

390
01:07:18,174 --> 01:07:20,731
We must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!

391
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:24,604
It'll be buried when I have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.

392
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:28,572
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?

393
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:32,397
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!

394
01:07:32,474 --> 01:07:35,065
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!

395
01:07:35,374 --> 01:07:38,568
Today we took another piece
of the city of Toktyl.

396
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:42,334
But I have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!

397
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,998
Madness. There will be no world.

398
01:07:47,074 --> 01:07:49,767
There will be no world.

399
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:53,305
We must find the talisman.
Only I can touch it, remember.

400
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:58,901
You take that way, I'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.

401
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:12,431
How's the food around here?

402
01:09:13,474 --> 01:09:14,837
Who are you?

403
01:10:22,374 --> 01:10:24,896
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.

404
01:10:46,174 --> 01:10:49,106
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.

405
01:10:49,174 --> 01:10:51,696
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:

406
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:55,103
The city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.

407
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,972
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.

408
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:04,568
Out of my way, child.

409
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:08,597
So that you can desert,
like the thief you are?

410
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:11,597
With my gold?

411
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:13,929
Hablok's gold?

412
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:23,564
Now that was unmannerly
of Your Highness...

413
01:11:24,174 --> 01:11:27,662
and rude little boys need correction...

414
01:11:27,974 --> 01:11:31,168
if they're going to grow up into...

415
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:43,136
I'm afraid Your Highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.

416
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:51,503
Now, yield, Black Spider.

417
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,735
Where's Queen Gedren?

418
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:44,671
She's gone. I'm so glad that you've come.

419
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:50,298
Please, will you protect me?
I'm so frightened.

420
01:13:03,473 --> 01:13:06,837
Gedren! Where are you?

421
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,166
So the Prince of Hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.

422
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:17,996
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?

423
01:13:18,773 --> 01:13:21,637
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!

424
01:13:26,341 --> 01:13:29,431
Get back, or Hablok will need
an heir to the throne.

425
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:31,529
And your own throne, Gedren.

426
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:35,562
Unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...

427
01:13:39,974 --> 01:13:42,270
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.

428
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,070
There's a way behind the throne.

429
01:13:47,707 --> 01:13:49,969
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!

430
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,566
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.

431
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,198
Now I shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.

432
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:00,705
What I did?

433
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:04,038
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.

434
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,664
My brother, my sister!

435
01:14:06,907 --> 01:14:09,634
Vermin! What were their lives
compared to this?

436
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:14,264
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.

437
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:15,234
Up here, Sonja.

438
01:15:17,174 --> 01:15:18,434
Up here.

439
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,438
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!

440
01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:05,896
Down this hallway!

441
01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:20,698
Sonja. Over here.

442
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:35,462
Falkon, help.

443
01:18:50,173 --> 01:18:51,662
Prince Tarn, come back.

444
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:55,297
I am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.

445
01:19:23,907 --> 01:19:25,668
Sonja, help me!

446
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:27,438
I'm trapped!

447
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:35,295
Sonja! Behind you!

448
01:20:48,773 --> 01:20:50,534
I can't get through.

449
01:20:53,373 --> 01:20:56,339
Falkon, pull her through. I'll hold the gate.

450
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:01,269
Follow me. This is the way out.

451
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:10,062
How do you know, Highness?

452
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:12,833
Because this is the way
I came in, you clown.

453
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,535
Here's the way through.

454
01:22:26,607 --> 01:22:28,004
Go. Quickly!

455
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:53,536
The door doesn't move.

456
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:54,867
How does it open?

457
01:22:54,939 --> 01:22:56,837
I know. Leave it to me.

458
01:22:57,773 --> 01:22:59,636
No! Come back, Prince!

459
01:23:11,773 --> 01:23:13,238
He's done it.

460
01:23:13,306 --> 01:23:16,761
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.

461
01:23:20,973 --> 01:23:23,439
Save yourselves! Run for it!

462
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:26,199
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!

463
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:28,597
Run! Run for it!

464
01:23:28,673 --> 01:23:31,400
I'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.

465
01:23:33,473 --> 01:23:36,961
Give me your hand. Reach. I'll get you out.

466
01:24:47,506 --> 01:24:49,335
Hablok is over there.

467
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:52,506
When it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.

468
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:55,137
I'm sure to need a queen someday.

469
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:56,796
You'll find one.

470
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,199
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.

471
01:25:00,772 --> 01:25:05,364
I make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.

472
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:09,064
That's a challenge
I might think about someday.

473
01:25:09,839 --> 01:25:11,635
What about right now?

474
01:25:17,906 --> 01:25:19,133
Why not?

475
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:52,933
Come along, Falkon.

476
01:25:53,772 --> 01:25:54,738
Come on.

477
01:28:48,472 --> 01:28:49,495
English
