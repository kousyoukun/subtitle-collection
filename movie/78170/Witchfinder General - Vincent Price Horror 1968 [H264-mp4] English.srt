<b>Witchfinder General - Vincent Price 
Horror 1968 [H264-mp4] English</b>

2
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:42,688
"Things I heard, as it were, the voice
of much people in heaven, saying,."

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,225
"Hallelujah."

4
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:49,424
"Salvation and glory and power
is to our God."

5
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:53,025
"For true and just are his judgments,"

6
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,798
"who hath judged the great harlot
which corrupted..."

7
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,443
"with her fornication,"

8
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:06,244
"and hath revenged the blood
of his servants, at her hands."

9
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:12,083
"Come, gather yourselves together
to the great supper of God."

10
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:17,559
"That you may eat the flesh of kings,
and the flesh of tribunes,"

11
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,325
"and the flesh of mighty men,
and the flesh of horses,"

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,996
"and of them that sit on them,
and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen,"

13
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,370
"and of little and of great."

14
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:36,809
"And I saw the beast,
and the kings of the earth,"

15
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:41,543
"and their armies gathered together
to make war with him"

16
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,949
"that sat upon the horse..."

17
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,284
Bring on some water!

18
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:51,452
"And the beast was taken,
and with him the false prophet,"

19
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:53,859
"who wrought signs before him,"

20
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:58,628
"wherewith he seduced them
who received the character of the beast,"

21
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,703
"and who adored his image."

22
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:07,368
"These two were cast alive into
the pool of fire, burning with brimstone."

23
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:12,540
"And the rest were slain by the sword
of him that sitteth upon the horse..."

24
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:16,244
"and all the birds were filled
with their flesh."

25
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,994
<i>The year is 1645.
England is in the grip of bloody civil war.</i>

26
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,865
<i>On the one side stand the Royalist party
of King Charles,</i>

27
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,600
<i>on the other, Cromwell's Parliamentary
party, the Round-heads.</i>

28
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,336
<i>The structure of law and order
has collapsed.</i>

29
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:57,641
<i>Local magistrates indulge
their individual whims,</i>

30
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:01,683
<i>justice and injustice are dispensed
in more or less equal quantities</i>

31
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,343
<i>and without opposition,</i>

32
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:06,650
<i>an atmosphere in which
the unscrupulous revel</i>

33
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>and the likes of Matthew Hopkins
take full advantage of the situation.</i>

34
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,726
<i>In a time where the superstitions of
country folk are still a powerful factor,</i>

35
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,662
<i>Hopkins preys upon them,</i>

36
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:21,260
<i>torturing and killing in a supposed drive
to eliminate witchcraft from the country</i>

37
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,738
<i>and doing so with the full blessing
of what law there is.</i>

38
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:29,141
<i>However, his influence is confined largely
to the eastern sector of the country,</i>

39
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:33,375
<i>East Anglia, which is held firmly
in Cromwell's grasp,</i>

40
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,815
<i>but not so firmly that
the Round-head cavalry patrols</i>

41
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,716
<i>have everything their own way,</i>

42
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,085
<i>for there still exists
an ever-present threat</i>

43
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,420
<i>from the remnants of the Royalist armies,</i>

44
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:45,790
<i>desperately foraging
for food, horses and supplies.</i>

45
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,630
- Stop that, Richard.
- What?

46
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,567
- What you're thinking.
- What am I thinking?

47
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,401
Ungodly thoughts of your Sara,
that's my guess.

48
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:02,206
Thoughts of Sara, yes. Ungodly?
Depends on how you look at it.

49
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,143
And you, a supporter of Cromwell...

50
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:07,910
- Hold your talking, you two.
- Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

51
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:13,144
We'll be stopping in a few minutes
to give the horses a rest.

52
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,451
You can gabble all you want then.

53
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:32,641
Fifteen minutes
and we'll be on our way again.

54
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,512
Get down. Royalist snipers.

55
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,556
Probably only a few of them
after food and horses.

56
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,091
We'll flush the bastards out in no time.

57
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,253
Marshall, you stop behind
to keep an eye on the nags.

58
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:56,355
The rest of you follow me
and keep spread out.

59
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,681
Captain, look! There's one!
I see him! Follow!

60
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,989
Harcourt, this way.

61
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,095
Robert?

62
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,837
Captain?

63
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,740
Captain Gordon, is that you?

64
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,009
We're here, trooper Marshall.

65
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,647
It's quite all right.

66
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,367
- Getting a bit nervous, were you, lad?
- Aye, just a bit, sir.

67
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,463
Well, no need to worry.
We got them all, I reckon...

68
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,484
Not quite all. One of them got away, sir,
though I put my sword in him first.

69
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,188
We'd better move on
out of this wood, then.

70
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,424
If he has got away,
he could still be dangerous.

71
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,728
Swallow, bury Brace's body
as soon as you can.

72
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,927
Look out, sir!

73
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,841
- Thank you, trooper Marshall.
- He was trying to kill you, sir.

74
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:28,178
- I gather that, trooper.
- It was a lucky shot, sir.

75
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,175
Yes.

76
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:32,686
Nevertheless, it could have
ended my career for good.

77
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,120
Right, we move out.

78
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:37,124
Swallow, join us as soon as
you've finished your business here.

79
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:38,591
Harcourt, give him a hand
to remove the bodies.

80
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:39,923
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:54,005
So, you granted young Richard
here leave, did you, Captain?

82
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,374
- I did.
- Aye, two days.

83
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,937
Then you'll be away to see your girl,
I suppose. And how will she greet you?

84
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:02,483
Just promoted cornet
for killing King's men.

85
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:05,425
She knows my reasons for fighting
and it's only while the trouble lasts.

86
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,954
What are you laughing at?

87
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,422
Leave him be, Robert.
Can't you see he's in love?

88
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,425
Aye, I'm not ashamed of it, either.

89
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,792
A toast, lads,
to the lovely women of Suffolk.

90
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:19,095
And may they keep their beds warm
for General Cromwell's gallant men.

91
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,148
Come on, boy. Nearly home.

92
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,604
Well!

93
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:37,973
Master Marshall, welcome.

94
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,604
I trust you're well, sir.

95
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:42,149
My body is as strong as ever,

96
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:44,953
but the war continues?

97
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:47,045
- Aye, we still fight.
- And why...

98
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,954
Well, my company's recruiting.
I have two days' leave.

99
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,459
- Then you must eat with us this evening.
- I thank you, sir.

100
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,931
We still have good food
for all you soldiers take it from us.

101
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,762
And ale. Come, we shall drink together.

102
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,611
After your experience,

103
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:13,273
it is likely our village has grown
a little smaller for you, eh, Richard?

104
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,613
Not so much smaller
as lacking in promise, perhaps.

105
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:22,515
In Ipswich or Cambridge,
a man might find better opportunities.

106
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,560
Richard, if you took Sara to wife...

107
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,686
You mean, you'd give us your blessing?

108
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,389
You would take her away from here?

109
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,522
You honor me, sir,

110
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,793
but I only have a small farm
that belonged to my father

111
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:33,927
and my soldier's pay, which is...

112
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,096
I am little concerned
with your ill kept lands.

113
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:41,768
And still less for the silver you get
for killing good Christians.

114
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:48,215
Well, forgive me. That was unjust.

115
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,808
But there is trouble coming to this village

116
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,718
and I want Sara far away
before it arrives.

117
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:57,623
Surely Suffolk should be free
from the King's armies.

118
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,390
It's not only the King's armies
which bring death this year.

119
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:04,989
A lack of order in the land
encourages strange ideas.

120
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:07,126
You mean more rebellion?

121
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,534
I'm sorry,
you have worries enough already.

122
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,075
But give me your word that
you will soon take Sara away from here

123
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,473
and you shall ask her consent tonight.

124
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:19,571
- You have my word on that, sir.
- Good, Richard. Good.

125
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,650
That's right, my dear.
Master Richard Marshall.

126
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,657
Farm boy into soldier.

127
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,590
Welcome back, Master Marshall.

128
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,886
I'm glad to be back, Mistress Sara.

129
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:39,263
By the way, Sara,
I expect the meal at the usual time.

130
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,960
Yes, Uncle.

131
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,166
Your uncle has agreed to our marriage.

132
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,275
Richard.

133
00:13:56,953 --> 00:14:00,787
Oh, the army has taught you
rough manners.

134
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,094
Sara, why is he frightened?

135
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,206
There have been threats to us
since you were last here.

136
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,936
- Threats? Why?
- We've been called papists and idolaters,

137
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,444
and filth chalked up on the walls.

138
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,607
They say we're King's creatures
and should be pilloried and worse.

139
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:28,717
Who says these things?

140
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,616
We've become outcasts in our own village.

141
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,790
Rest easy.

142
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,519
Now, no one shall harm you.

143
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,128
I put my oath to that.

144
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,659
Have you arranged a day
for the wedding, Richard?

145
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:55,141
No, sir.
Much depends on how the armies move.

146
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,109
Remember, it must be soon.

147
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:00,205
But how certain are your fears
of this danger?

148
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,376
Perhaps just an old man's bad dream,

149
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,388
and being an old man,
I must early to my bed.

150
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,084
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night, Uncle.

151
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,650
Oh, and Sara, remember to see
the doors are well bolted.

152
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,060
Yes, Uncle.

153
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,861
And Richard,
don't keep Mistress Sara up too late.

154
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:21,334
Country women need full eight hours
in their beds

155
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:24,167
if they're to be proper wives and mothers.

156
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,870
- Goodnight, Cornet.
- Goodnight, sir.

157
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,078
And will you make a proper wife
and mother, Sara?

158
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,187
I still have much to learn, Richard.

159
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,088
I'll teach you.

160
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,129
Now, didn't your uncle just say
you must early to bed?

161
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,960
- He did.
- And isn't he a wise man?

162
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,864
- He is.
- Right.

163
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,368
How much further, Matthew?

164
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,494
You will not call me Matthew.

165
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,871
I'm not one of your drinking cronies,
carousing and wenching in the taverns.

166
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,016
Aye, you're not that, sir.

167
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,671
Remember, John Stearne, you ride with
me only because you help me in my work.

168
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,045
- Oh, you call it work?
- It's the Lord's work, a noble thing...

169
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:16,379
And a profitable one.

170
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:18,976
The Good Lord paying in silver
for every hanging.

171
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,181
That is blasphemy, Stearne.
Hold your tongue.

172
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,088
I'm merely an honest man
who helps you get your confessions.

173
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:27,185
The law has prescribed due methods
of interrogation.

174
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,491
And I have been blessed with the skills
to carry them out.

175
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:32,533
Oh, stop your gabbling.
We have work to do in Brandeston.

176
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,795
Who is it this time?

177
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,371
- The message tells of a priest.
- A priest?

178
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,407
One who gives worship to Satan
and calls him Lord.

179
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:44,810
Oh, with the priest himself a witch, there'll
be others corrupted, too, I'm thinking.

180
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:47,109
You enjoy torture, don't you, Stearne?

181
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:50,413
And you, sir?

182
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:57,384
Goodbye, sir.
God be with you, Richard.

183
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,697
- Goodbye, Richard.
- Goodbye, Sara. I'll see you again soon.

184
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,178
Given up ale for star-gazing, Tom Salter?

185
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,407
Not star-gazing, Master Marshall. Waiting.

186
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:55,107
What for?

187
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,481
Matthew Hopkins, a lawyer.

188
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,453
Must be important,
that you wait after dark.

189
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,414
- It is, that.
- Aye.

190
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,120
Well, if I see a lawyer on the road,
I'll tell him you're here.

191
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,287
How far is it to Brandeston, friend?

192
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,058
- About three miles.
- Thank you.

193
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,962
- Are you the lawyer?
- Aye.

194
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,001
- Name of Hopkins?
- Aye, Matthew Hopkins.

195
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,663
- And this is my assistant, John Stearne.
- Why do you want to know, soldier?

196
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,673
There's some men from the village
back there, waiting for you.

197
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,367
Aye, they sent for us.

198
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,036
What would a lawyer want in Brandeston?

199
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:01,583
A man who may not be
what he seems to be. Come Stearne.

200
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,429
- John Lowes is his name.
- An evil man.

201
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,401
- A papist.
- Yeah, burning candles and all.

202
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:25,029
That is no proof of witchcraft in itself.

203
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,040
Dressed himself in devil's garments,
he did.

204
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,337
- And made unholy signs.
- Yeah, he did. I saw him.

205
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:32,744
I will find out the truth for you.
Have no fear, friends.

206
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,598
Yes?

207
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,935
John Lowes?

208
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:20,985
So, it has come to this.

209
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,894
You accuse me, a priest,
of working with the Devil.

210
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,694
We can only judge by the evidence.

211
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,860
And there's a lot of that, old man.

212
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,904
I reject your accusations totally.

213
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,267
He's going to give us trouble.

214
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,807
A simple confession, priest,
that's all we ask.

215
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:34,909
Help us.

216
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,501
We've got a lot of work to do
in Brandeston.

217
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,581
Leave my house, the pair of you.

218
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,281
I told you he was going to be difficult.

219
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,183
I reject your foul suggestions!
Leave here at once!

220
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:48,188
All you reject is the true God!
Take him, Stearne.

221
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,155
Look for the Devil's marks upon him.

222
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,227
Right. Help us, you two.

223
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:07,533
- Look, he still prays to Satan.
- Get on with your task.

224
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:12,637
If the Devil made you a priest, he's going
to have hidden his mark with a lot of care.

225
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,219
To what purpose is this?

226
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:26,090
When the Devil buys a soul, he marks
the person's flesh, so we will know him.

227
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:30,154
If such a mark is pricked,
no blood will flow, nor pain be felt.

228
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,703
Mistress Sara? Mistress Sara?
They've come for him.

229
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,100
Seems Satan has hidden
his mark well, Matthew.

230
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,232
Set him to running.

231
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:18,006
Quick, then, you two, around the table.
And keep him moving.

232
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,764
You would be his niece.

233
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,303
- Your name, child?
- Sara.

234
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:45,906
I am Matthew Hopkins, Witchfinder.

235
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,811
Being his niece,
you, too, may be corrupted by Satan.

236
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,180
No, not his niece.

237
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,382
A foundling,

238
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,146
taken in by him and his housekeeper.

239
00:23:58,253 --> 00:24:00,380
- Are you telling me the truth, child?
- Yes, yes, of course.

240
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,582
When she died, I became his servant.

241
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:04,919
And you've remained innocent
all of these years?

242
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,027
Yes, sir, entirely.

243
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,995
- I trust you know the old man?
- Better than anyone.

244
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:12,931
In private talk, we may shed some light
on his innocence.

245
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,702
Private?

246
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:17,601
Yes, away from the distraction
of the crowd.

247
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,503
Perhaps in the quiet of your room tonight,

248
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:22,873
you might be able to help me
prove him guiltless.

249
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:25,242
Would you release him now?

250
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:29,682
You might be convinced tonight
that this is all needless.

251
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,659
And you will make every effort to present
the facts to me?

252
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:42,962
- You may come to my room tonight, sir.
- At what hour?

253
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:49,166
At 8:00, if you'll release him now.

254
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:56,003
All right. He can sleep in the jail,
and we'll be rid of him.

255
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:14,227
Come on!
Get up, you papist bastard!

256
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,567
- Has he confessed yet?
- Not a word.

257
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:23,399
- Well, then stop this.
- But he hasn't confessed.

258
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:27,669
Take him to the jail. We'll continue
the interrogation tomorrow.

259
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,177
Jail... You heard what he said.

260
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,140
Quiet down, you animal.

261
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:39,452
You know what, Marston? There
were these couple of right filthy girls,

262
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:41,852
filthy they were!
Horrible to behold, horrible!

263
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,049
- Witches?
- Yes, both of them.

264
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:44,955
We hanged them, Matthew and me.

265
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,119
Matthew. You know Matthew,
he's my partner.

266
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,322
Did it take you long to get
a confession out of them, John?

267
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,331
Well, a couple of days with one of them,
the other one...

268
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,128
Do you want more ale, sir?

269
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,198
Go on, then? Come on.
What about the other one?

270
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,864
Tell us about her.
Oh, yeah, the other one.

271
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,966
Now, she was a real strange one, she was.

272
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:05,012
Loved us for it,
like she wanted to get strung up.

273
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:07,313
Reckon that was the only bit
of excitement she ever had.

274
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:11,347
Well, go on, then, Mr. Stearne.

275
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:13,821
Go on.

276
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,839
Sara, I've come to question you.

277
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,375
You came here for a purpose, sir.

278
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:47,922
I came here to get your evidence
about the priest.

279
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,954
He's been kind to me.

280
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:53,527
Perhaps he had a motive.

281
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:58,230
Men sometimes have strange motives
for the things they do.

282
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,369
I know.

283
00:27:02,471 --> 00:27:07,408
My motive in coming here was
to find the truth.

284
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:21,419
How about the priest, Master Hopkins?

285
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:24,981
We'll have done with him in a day or two.
Have no fear, child.

286
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:27,891
- He's been good to me in his way.
- He is an idolater.

287
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:30,430
He must confess and die.
Stearne will see to that.

288
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:32,659
Oh, no, please!
Don't let him be harmed, please!

289
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:37,364
You seek to protect a witch
from rightful justice?

290
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:39,702
Oh, no, not that,
but couldn't he be kept in a cell?

291
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,537
He could do no harm from a prison cell.
Oh, please!

292
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:44,077
But justice must be done, my dear.

293
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,069
Grant me this.

294
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,177
Please, Matthew.

295
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,687
Past noon,
you unkempt lout. Get up!

296
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:08,129
Get away!

297
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,364
I need air.

298
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,084
- Where's the priest?
- Where you put him, in the jail.

299
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,164
We'll get him out
and start questioning him, then, eh?

300
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,934
- No.
- What?

301
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,203
- He stays where he is.
- But we have no confession at all.

302
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,871
I said we'll leave him in the cell.

303
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,047
All right, then. All right.

304
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,019
What about the women? When are
we going to start interrogating them?

305
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,715
I hear tell they've a good few witches
around this place.

306
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,385
- When you're in fit condition.
- I'm fighting-fit as it is.

307
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,758
Oh, and where were you
last night, Matthew?

308
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:14,097
- I hear tell you've been a-wandering.
- You hear tell too much, man.

309
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,792
You, there, old man.

310
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:48,267
Master Hopkins, the Witchfinder,

311
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:52,066
he says you're to be kept here,
interrogated no further.

312
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:16,193
- Where are you off to, John?
- I'm going for a walk.

313
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:17,725
By myself.

314
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:45,676
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

315
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,447
Tell me that! Come on! Tell me!

316
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:53,911
Confess, witch!

317
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:57,253
- Tell us your foul iniquities!
- No!

318
00:32:57,358 --> 00:33:00,759
Your familiars, woman. Confess!

319
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:08,659
Stop. For God's sake, stop.

320
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,598
Quiet, old man, and be thankful
you're not getting the same.

321
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:21,871
How many of them? A dog? A ferret?
Come on, tell them!

322
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:27,578
John. The Witchfinder, he's coming.

323
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:40,566
I trust you are using
the prescribed methods, Stearne?

324
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,135
Naturally.

325
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,465
Has she confessed?

326
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,336
Well, give me time.
She's only been here an hour.

327
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,208
Continue with the interrogation.
I shall be gone for a while.

328
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:55,874
You're always going off somewhere, sir,
aren't you?

329
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,147
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

330
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,619
I've been called over the hill
to the next village.

331
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,783
I shall be back by tomorrow.

332
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:07,487
You will remain in charge here.

333
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,029
Carry on your work
while you're away, aye, sir?

334
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,359
Indeed.

335
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,699
- And the priest?
- I said to leave him be.

336
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,838
What do you want?

337
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:06,416
- You.
- Where's Master Hopkins?

338
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,616
- Gone.
- Gone?

339
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:13,656
- Where?
- Just gone.

340
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,092
He's left me in charge.

341
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,805
No! No!

342
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:39,486
No!

343
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:44,118
And don't think I don't know
why the old priest is being spared, eh?

344
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:04,238
Stearne, the priest.
I've changed my mind.

345
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,553
Confess!

346
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:23,120
Confess.

347
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,657
He confessed. You heard him.

348
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:33,359
I've heard nothing yet, Master Hopkins.

349
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:36,596
Refresh Master Salter's memory, Stearne.

350
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,668
You heard him.

351
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,545
You did, too.

352
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:49,979
Yes, Master Hopkins.

353
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,983
Witnesses.

354
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:07,166
Get up, you blasted witch! Get up!

355
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:09,967
Come on!

356
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:11,088
You are, all of you, confessed idolaters.

357
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,933
However, these proceedings shall be
carried out through due process of law.

358
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:20,303
What law demands, we shall satisfy.

359
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:25,675
You will each be tied in a prescribed
fashion, and cast into the moat.

360
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,547
Should you then sink, we will know
that your confessions are false.

361
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:35,816
If on the other hand
you are seen to swim or float,

362
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:40,485
then your confessions of witchcraft
are proven beyond a doubt

363
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:42,529
in the sight of God.

364
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,361
And you will be withdrawn from the water

365
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,662
and hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

366
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:53,536
You can't hang me. The law forbids it!
I'm with child.

367
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,610
And who would want
to make you pregnant, witch?

368
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,842
Quiet. Stearne, go on with your task.

369
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,593
Oh, God, help me!

370
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,659
- No!
- No!

371
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,134
No! Help me...

372
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,374
Hey, look! One of them is gone already.

373
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,810
They swim.

374
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:11,712
The mark of Satan is upon them.
Give us a hand here! Come on!

375
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,777
They must hang.

376
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:31,495
She was innocent.

377
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:35,667
God forgive you, Matthew Hopkins.

378
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:39,340
Jailer,

379
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:43,044
take them to the tree.

380
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:03,863
The money from the magistrate,
nine guineas in silver.

381
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:06,303
Good. Now we can leave.

382
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:00,186
- Good morning, soldier.
- Good morning.

383
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:02,125
What'll you be after in the way
of horses, then, aye?

384
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:04,356
A dozen or so for General Cromwell's
armies up north.

385
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:05,762
Well, lost a few, have you?

386
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:07,766
Aye, at Cheriton Wood.

387
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,803
That's a pretty sorry looking bunch
of old nags you got in there, friend.

388
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:13,499
- The best we could find.
- Then they'll have to do.

389
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:16,041
- A dozen you say, eh?
- Aye.

390
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:20,102
We'll be back in Suffolk soon where,
thank God, they still breed strong horses.

391
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:21,909
Oh, I doubt you'll find much better there.

392
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,110
I'm just back from those parts.
The mounts up there are much like these.

393
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,050
Have you been through
Brandeston at all, man?

394
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:28,246
Brandeston? Aye.

395
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,380
And a fine commotion
they're stirring up there.

396
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:31,891
What, over you taking their horses?

397
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,426
No, nothing like that. A mass hanging.

398
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,756
- Who?
- Witches, I heard.

399
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,921
Two women and a priest.

400
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,727
- Where was the priest from, man?
- Brandeston, I suppose.

401
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:43,634
A brave old boy for all his white hairs.
Was he a friend of yours?

402
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:46,070
Two troopers, Gifford and Harcourt,
will be here directly.

403
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,640
Have them take these horses here
back to the regiment

404
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:48,766
and report that I'm delayed.

405
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,756
I'll join them further north.
Do you understand?

406
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:53,974
Yes, but where will you be going to?
Anything else?

407
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:32,577
Sara!

408
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:39,617
Sara?

409
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:43,221
Sara!

410
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:55,433
Sara.

411
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:57,935
Sara!

412
00:44:58,879 --> 00:44:59,937
Sara!

413
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,379
Sara!

414
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:53,892
They took him and killed him.
They said he was an idolater.

415
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:55,592
I know, I heard.

416
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:00,964
- Sara...
- One of them, the Witchfinder,

417
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:04,005
he...

418
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,140
He...

419
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:12,180
I didn't want to...

420
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:16,648
I thought I could save him.

421
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,519
I thought they'd have pity.

422
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,660
We kneel before thee, oh, Lord, in humility

423
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:06,299
to ask for a blessing on our union.

424
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:11,510
We ask for forgiveness of our sins

425
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:17,676
and strength to lead righteous lives
as man and wife.

426
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:26,054
We pray also for the soul of thy servant,
John Lowes.

427
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:29,821
May he know eternal peace.

428
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:42,034
And it is in thy sight, oh, Lord,
that I hereby swear.

429
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,234
I shall not rest from
the pursuit of his murderers

430
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:52,442
till they stand before thee,
ready to answer to thee for their sins.

431
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,335
Take this money and whatever you need
from the rectory and go to Lavenham.

432
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:13,269
- You'll be safer there.
- I will, Richard.

433
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:16,605
Find lodgings and stay there.
I'll come to you.

434
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:33,722
I love you very much.

435
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,119
Oh, Richard!

436
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:26,831
Shepherd, I seek two men.
Witchfinders, they call themselves.

437
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,998
They were said to be headed this way.

438
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,508
- Matthew Hopkins and his assistant?
- Aye.

439
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:36,049
I've heard they're in Hoxne, about
four miles yonder, but I can't be sure.

440
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,674
Thank you, Shepherd.

441
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,978
Get out!

442
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:17,455
Oh, come on, Johnny, give us a kiss.

443
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:22,086
- Oh, get away from me.
- Stop it, you dirty rascal!

444
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:23,561
Stop it!

445
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:26,029
Here, I'll bet you two pennies.

446
00:51:28,435 --> 00:51:31,893
- Ale, soldier?
- Aye, to wash the dust from my throat.

447
00:51:35,742 --> 00:51:37,835
- Another one for you?
- Aye, get a move on with it.

448
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:39,378
She's got a powerful thirst still.

449
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:41,777
Landlord, I'm looking for a man
called Hopkins.

450
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:44,373
- I heard he was coming this way.
- Matthew Hopkins?

451
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:48,079
- Would you know where he is, friend?
- Aye, he's gone to Cambridge today.

452
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,089
But you got an accusation to make,
I'll get your confession for you.

453
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,819
I do the pricking, you know, not Matthew.

454
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:56,987
I'm your man, friend.
John Stearne, they call me.

455
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:01,390
I'm husband to Sara Lowes.

456
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:44,071
- You all right, friend?
- Yeah.

457
00:52:44,177 --> 00:52:47,908
- You better get out of here.
- Yeah, I'm going, don't worry.

458
00:52:58,558 --> 00:53:01,356
As for you, soldier, you are coming down
to see the magistrate.

459
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:04,123
Am I? Not with you.

460
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:57,399
Quick, Matthew!

461
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,152
For God's sake, Stearne,
what have you done? Who was that?

462
00:55:15,262 --> 00:55:16,923
- Richard Marshall.
- Who?

463
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,294
He's married to the girl, Sara.

464
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,095
- How did he find you?
- He was looking for you.

465
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,602
He found out about Brandeston.
We're going to have to separate.

466
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:25,762
I won't run from him.

467
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:27,999
We have work to do down south
in Lavenham.

468
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:29,973
Not me. He's after our blood.

469
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,636
Seems to me he's already had
some of yours.

470
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,611
Well, he's not going to have any more,
you understand?

471
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:37,239
You're forgetting our powers.
He could be a witch.

472
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,614
He's a man who's out to kill both of us.

473
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,486
Then it appears to me that we should
take steps to see to his death first.

474
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,684
Come. We travel to Lavenham.

475
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,420
I full well understand
your feelings, Cornet,

476
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:20,959
but you're an officer of the army,
a soldier,

477
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:23,325
and desertion is punishable by death.

478
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,591
However, in this case,
there are two factors

479
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:29,567
which will stay me from subjecting you
to a full court-martial.

480
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:32,836
One, we are grouped here at Naseby

481
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:35,840
in preparation for a major assault
on the Royalist armies.

482
00:56:35,942 --> 00:56:38,240
We need every man we can get.

483
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:41,337
And you're a pretty good soldier,
most of the time.

484
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:42,938
Thank you, sir.

485
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,350
Secondly, I would sleep ill
if I had to send to the gallows

486
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:49,354
a man who had saved my life.

487
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:51,481
But, Cornet, remember this.

488
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:55,021
If you should leave your command again,

489
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:58,087
I will have no alternative but to throw

490
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:00,666
the whole weight of military law
against you.

491
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:02,997
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

492
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,362
Dismissed, Cornet.

493
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:13,910
And may God help you in your search,
Cornet Marshall.

494
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:33,394
Robert, hello.

495
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,195
- Richard, you're back.
- Aye.

496
00:57:35,302 --> 00:57:38,100
- What happened with the Captain?
- Nothing.

497
00:57:39,272 --> 00:57:43,572
I heard about Brandeston, Richard.
Hopkins and Stearne.

498
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:46,874
- I'll find them somewhere.
- But what can you do?

499
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,107
What proof have you
that they committed any crime?

500
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,548
- I've got Sara's word on it.
- Is that enough for the magistrates?

501
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:55,883
- There'll be no magistrates involved.
- What do you mean?

502
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:04,329
We'll talk more later, Richard.
We must be on our way.

503
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,899
We're after horses for this skirmish
that's coming up.

504
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,628
- All right.
- Come on.

505
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:27,282
Parliament men,
comrades of friend Marshall.

506
00:58:28,054 --> 00:58:30,682
There's some good ones
coming now, look.

507
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,382
- Hey!
- Let's make a run for it, shall we,

508
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:34,323
- while we can.
- Be calm.

509
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,724
Yeah, but if they find out
who we are, they'll...

510
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:37,626
They won't. Come on.

511
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:55,637
That's a fine horse you've got there, friend.
The army needs mounts of such caliber.

512
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:56,909
I am not selling.

513
00:58:57,017 --> 00:58:58,678
But you will get your money
when the war's over.

514
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,754
You don't appear to understand.
I am not selling.

515
00:59:01,855 --> 00:59:05,689
Oh, but you are selling, friend.
And we'll take that one, there, too.

516
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,590
So you filthy soldiers can
butcher my mare?

517
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:11,687
Sergeant, he thinks we're filthy soldiers.
Do you hear?

518
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,798
Aye, I heard.

519
00:59:12,899 --> 00:59:14,730
You can't go saying
things like that, friend.

520
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:17,632
What he needs is a little army discipline.

521
00:59:17,737 --> 00:59:20,501
I hear you need more pikemen
in your platoon, Sergeant.

522
00:59:20,607 --> 00:59:22,040
You'll pay for this!

523
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,279
Good horse you had, there.
Cost a pretty penny, I reckon.

524
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,603
We robbed the canteen mint.

525
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,075
A right jester, he is.

526
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:01,045
Yeah, well, a day's fighting in Cromwell's
army will soon cure your wit, my lad.

527
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:02,580
I am not doing any fighting,

528
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,378
neither for the King
or your precious Cromwell, either.

529
01:00:05,485 --> 01:00:08,147
- You mark that well, soldier.
- Yeah, you coward.

530
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:09,482
Just like your friend.

531
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:11,921
- Matthew Hopkins is no friend of mine.
- Hopkins?

532
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,516
The fancy boy who just made a fool
of your cavalry, comrade.

533
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:16,390
- You rode with him.
- I had reasons.

534
01:00:16,496 --> 01:00:18,157
- He pays you?
- We were partners.

535
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:20,164
- In what business?
- Extermination.

536
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:22,029
- Eh?
- And what does that mean?

537
01:03:05,498 --> 01:03:06,590
Now,

538
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,936
Matthew Hopkins, sir.

539
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:25,078
- Adequate, very adequate.
- We did our best, sir.

540
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:27,672
Lavenham has served me well,
Master Webb.

541
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:29,978
Now I must find out how I can serve you.

542
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,077
They're all women, sir.

543
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:36,147
Strange, isn't it, how much iniquity
the Lord vested in the female?

544
01:03:36,259 --> 01:03:38,159
Pardon, sir?

545
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:42,357
- Who makes the accusations?
- Myself, sir. I'm representing the town.

546
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:44,228
- How many?
- Three, sir.

547
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,357
And what age?

548
01:03:45,468 --> 01:03:48,164
Well, two are young, sir,
Elizabeth Clark and Mary Reynolds.

549
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:50,102
The other's worn and old.

550
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:52,367
Fetch the young pair here to me.

551
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:53,533
What of the other hag?

552
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:56,043
Well, the old ones are more sensible.

553
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:59,512
It's the young ones who are stubborn.
They require time.

554
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:00,946
Oh, I see.

555
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:04,681
- Sir?
- Yes, man?

556
01:04:04,787 --> 01:04:08,746
Your assistant, sir. We were told
he, too, would be coming to Lavenham.

557
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:12,521
He's engaged elsewhere.
He's fighting for the Parliamentary cause.

558
01:04:12,628 --> 01:04:15,654
Oh. He will be joining you here, sir?

559
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:16,959
I really can't say.

560
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,557
- You can manage without him?
- Of course.

561
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:22,001
- I apologize...
- No.

562
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:23,594
Not only can I manage without him,

563
01:04:23,706 --> 01:04:26,607
but I intend to instigate
a new method of execution,

564
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:31,772
and you, Master Webb,
you shall aid me in carrying it out.

565
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:34,783
- What's that, sir?
- You'll see.

566
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:40,185
It's a fitting end for the foul ungodliness
in womankind.

567
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:41,779
Yes, sir.

568
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,020
Now, fetch that young pair here.

569
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:45,218
Sir.

570
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:02,370
An excellent meal, gentlemen.

571
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:09,508
There is little I find so satisfying
as good food after a well-earned victory.

572
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:11,449
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Entirely, General.

573
01:05:11,554 --> 01:05:14,546
The conflict at Naseby, sir, will go down
as a triumph of your strategy.

574
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:16,056
Perhaps.

575
01:05:16,158 --> 01:05:19,924
I would rather that it went down as
a triumph for the forces of true godliness.

576
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:23,055
Nevertheless, your name will symbolize
the victory, sir.

577
01:05:23,165 --> 01:05:25,133
Whether I like it or not, eh, Captain?

578
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:38,739
That cornet you so highly recommended
to me, is he to join us?

579
01:05:38,848 --> 01:05:40,208
He's coming now, General Cromwell.

580
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,249
Good.

581
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:45,344
Amongst the most pleasurable aspects
of victory, gentlemen,

582
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:48,514
is the opportunity it affords
to reward valor.

583
01:05:48,624 --> 01:05:50,854
It ranks almost with good food.

584
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:56,061
- Cornet Marshall, sir.
- All right. Rest, Cornet.

585
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,438
Your captain has told me about you.

586
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:07,167
- He says you're a good soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

587
01:06:07,943 --> 01:06:10,343
He recommends that
I promote you to captain.

588
01:06:10,446 --> 01:06:11,879
I thank you, sir.

589
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:14,779
I have a special mission for you, Captain.

590
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:18,778
Take three men
and ride back into East Anglia.

591
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:23,325
The King has escaped us and is rumored
to be making for the Norfolk coast.

592
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:27,886
If that is the case, find and apprehend him
before he can escape to the continent.

593
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:31,626
- It's an honor, sir.
- Pick your men. Start at once.

594
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:35,966
If you find the King,
you will escort him then to Norwich.

595
01:06:36,072 --> 01:06:40,406
If not, join us in the west.
Good luck, Captain.

596
01:06:50,419 --> 01:06:53,149
Shall we rest up for the night, Richard?

597
01:06:53,255 --> 01:06:55,951
We've got a job to do.
We'll go on till we've done it.

598
01:06:56,058 --> 01:07:00,620
Do you mean looking for the King?
Or finding Hopkins and Stearne?

599
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:02,458
Both.

600
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:04,829
Richard, you can't go off and desert again.

601
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:06,629
I don't plan to desert!

602
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,465
But supposing you do find out
where they are?

603
01:07:09,572 --> 01:07:11,172
Then I shall take temporary leave again.

604
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,731
For God's sake, Richard,
I know how you feel,

605
01:07:13,843 --> 01:07:17,779
but to risk court-martial
to kill Parliament's own appointees,

606
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,279
you'll be hanged yourself.

607
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:23,579
Robert! I've taken an oath.
I won't break it!

608
01:07:23,686 --> 01:07:25,916
- It's madness!
- It's justice!

609
01:07:27,456 --> 01:07:29,083
It's my justice.

610
01:07:33,395 --> 01:07:35,056
And what about one of them, sir?

611
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:37,404
You won't find better horseflesh
in the whole of Suffolk.

612
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:41,300
So, how much you going to try
to drag out of me if I take that one?

613
01:07:41,403 --> 01:07:44,167
- He's yours for a couple of guineas, sir.
- A guinea.

614
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:46,901
A guinea and a half for getting me
out of bed at this hour of the morning.

615
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:49,204
- One guinea.
- And a quarter?

616
01:07:49,311 --> 01:07:50,676
I'll quarter you.

617
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:53,509
- You drive a hard bargain, sir.
- Yeah.

618
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:56,483
And where would you be heading
that you need a horse in such a hurry?

619
01:07:56,585 --> 01:07:59,053
- To find my partner.
- Your partner, eh?

620
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:01,385
And what line of business
might you be in?

621
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,458
God's business, witch-finding.

622
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:07,086
Witch-finding. Oh, that's nice.
That's very nice.

623
01:08:07,196 --> 01:08:10,063
You wouldn't make it a guinea
and a quarter, would you?

624
01:08:10,933 --> 01:08:13,663
Do you know a man
called Matthew Hopkins?

625
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:18,232
- You know where he is?
- I heard tell of such a man down south.

626
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,534
Lavenham, I believe.

627
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:21,473
What's he doing in Lavenham?

628
01:08:21,577 --> 01:08:23,943
Extracting confessions, I don't doubt.

629
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:26,981
You let me have
that four-legged cripple now!

630
01:08:44,099 --> 01:08:45,430
This happened three days ago.

631
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:47,024
Why didn't you report it
to the militia then?

632
01:08:47,136 --> 01:08:49,104
How should we know
it was the King himself?

633
01:08:49,205 --> 01:08:52,834
A stranger, obviously a townsman,
tries to hire a boat to cross to France

634
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:55,843
- and you suspect nothing?
- When the country's torn by civil war?

635
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,607
I didn't know there was a war on
till you gentlemen told me so.

636
01:08:58,714 --> 01:09:00,511
Oh, come on, Richard.
We'd better go back.

637
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:03,551
Aye, I suppose so. I want to pass through
Lavenham and see how Sara is.

638
01:09:03,652 --> 01:09:05,847
- Lavenham?
- Aye, how far is it from here?

639
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,650
About two days ride, I reckon.

640
01:09:07,756 --> 01:09:10,987
They got more excitement over there
than any of your city folk's wars.

641
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:13,926
- What do you mean?
- They're burning witches there, I hear.

642
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:16,429
- Some such rigmarole.
- They're in Lavenham!

643
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,862
Richard!

644
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:03,409
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

645
01:10:04,179 --> 01:10:05,874
Oh, God!

646
01:10:08,017 --> 01:10:10,451
- All is ready, Master Hopkins?
- Aye.

647
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:13,653
Proceed with the executions, then.

648
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:18,825
Bring forth Elizabeth Clark.

649
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:22,395
Right. Siegel, fetch the rope.

650
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:32,267
Get the rope.
Oh, come on, you little bitch!

651
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,520
No! Help!

652
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:47,846
No!

653
01:11:32,434 --> 01:11:33,434
No!

654
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:08,001
- Lower away.
- Slowly, now. Keep her slow.

655
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:35,256
Elizabeth!

656
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:53,072
Master Hopkins,
there are two more to be burned.

657
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:56,982
Yes, Magistrate. Master Webb, the others!

658
01:13:27,082 --> 01:13:29,141
Here you are, 12 guineas in silver.

659
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:31,776
To be spent in the service
of our Lord, Magistrate.

660
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:34,253
We must thank you for your good work,
Master Witchfinder.

661
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:36,847
Thank you, Magistrate, for your aid.

662
01:13:45,868 --> 01:13:48,496
- Witchfinder!
- Greetings, Stearne.

663
01:13:48,604 --> 01:13:51,072
Is that all you've got to say after
leaving me there with Cromwell's men?

664
01:13:51,173 --> 01:13:53,801
Well, I provided us both
with the opportunity to escape.

665
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:55,638
Only you did and I was captured.

666
01:13:55,744 --> 01:13:57,803
Fortunes of war, Stearne.

667
01:13:58,881 --> 01:14:03,079
You know me well enough to know that
I wouldn't hesitate to fire and kill you.

668
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:04,846
Aye, you would that.

669
01:14:04,953 --> 01:14:09,413
I hold all human life dearly, Stearne,
especially my own.

670
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:10,822
Oh, come now.

671
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:14,521
- You've escaped and all is well.
- Maybe.

672
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:18,999
I even saved your share of the pay
even though I did all of the work myself.

673
01:14:19,101 --> 01:14:22,229
Now, are you going to be sensible
or do I kill you?

674
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:26,467
By the way, do you know
what they call me now?

675
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:27,837
What?

676
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:29,843
Witchfinder General.

677
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:33,676
There are those who think that I should be
appointed such for all of England,

678
01:14:33,782 --> 01:14:35,716
appointed by Parliament.

679
01:14:36,885 --> 01:14:38,182
Here! Look.

680
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:42,857
- Sara. She's here.
- Very nice, eh, Matthew?

681
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:43,958
No, you fool.

682
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:47,985
Don't you realize that if she's here,
that trooper must be around, too?

683
01:14:48,096 --> 01:14:52,089
- But he's away fighting.
- Suppose he got leave after Naseby.

684
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,225
Where do you think he'd go?
To see her, of course.

685
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:55,816
- We better move along then, eh?
- No.

686
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,362
That man, Marshall,
is not going to give up.

687
01:14:58,473 --> 01:15:00,304
He's proved that to us already.

688
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:02,070
Then we have to get him
before he gets us, right?

689
01:15:02,177 --> 01:15:04,702
We have the power to do it, legally.

690
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:07,281
- Prove him a witch, huh?
- Exactly.

691
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:11,148
- He'd never confess, not that one.
- On his own, no.

692
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:13,687
But if we had him and the girl?

693
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:16,314
Yeah, she's the niece of a man
we executed for witchcraft.

694
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:18,256
And Marshall is her husband.

695
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,260
I owe that jumped-up plowboy
a seeing-to.

696
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:24,162
Go out and ask around.
Find out if he's been seen.

697
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:28,362
If not, we'll tarry here a while
until he does arrive.

698
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:46,877
Who is it?
Sara, open the door. It's me.

699
01:15:48,724 --> 01:15:50,021
Richard?

700
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,864
They were here, Hopkins and Stearne.

701
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:07,305
I didn't know what to do.
I saw them in the street.

702
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:08,603
- I didn't know if they saw me or not.
- I know.

703
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,041
I know.

704
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:18,753
Well, I'll be in the tavern
with the others, then.

705
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:38,197
He's here, Matthew! Just arrived.

706
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,773
- Where's he gone?
- To see the girl.

707
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,968
- Alone?
- Yeah. The three others are in the tavern.

708
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:43,942
Go and get us an extra man to help.

709
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:45,035
Where are we going to take them,
Matthew?

710
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:46,910
Up to the castle.

711
01:16:47,015 --> 01:16:49,347
The magistrate here is very helpful.

712
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:50,918
That's where you interrogated the others,
is it?

713
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:52,111
Yes.

714
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:54,781
Now, hurry to it, man.

715
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:19,547
What are you going to do?

716
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:22,845
You say Hopkins arrived two days ago.

717
01:17:22,951 --> 01:17:26,409
Yes, and then he was with the other one
in the street today.

718
01:17:27,322 --> 01:17:28,619
And they haven't left yet?

719
01:17:28,724 --> 01:17:31,386
I'm not sure. I've been
too scared to leave.

720
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,586
Come on! Open up in there!

721
01:17:47,476 --> 01:17:49,444
Drop that sword, soldier.

722
01:17:56,485 --> 01:18:00,148
This man accuses you, Sara Lowes,
and you, Richard Marshall,

723
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:01,552
of consorting with the Devil.

724
01:18:01,656 --> 01:18:03,576
- Is that not so, Master Webb?
- It is that, sir.

725
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:05,616
Will you describe your evidence to us?

726
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:08,161
I observed the accused talking
with their familiars

727
01:18:08,263 --> 01:18:09,890
and making the signs of Satan, sir.

728
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:12,660
And what were these familiars
to which you refer?

729
01:18:12,768 --> 01:18:14,463
Black cat and a stoat, sir.

730
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:17,436
You're a very observing citizen,
Master Webb.

731
01:18:18,373 --> 01:18:21,240
Well, Sara, do you confess?

732
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:27,073
And what do you have to say, soldier?

733
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,112
I'm going to kill you, Hopkins.

734
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:37,188
I don't think you'll find that easy.
The law is with me, remember?

735
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:40,784
And what are you? An accused witch.

736
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:43,524
They must be submitted to the test.
Take them, Stearne.

737
01:18:52,874 --> 01:18:54,307
Hopkins!

738
01:18:59,347 --> 01:19:01,315
A Royalist sympathizer,
evidently.

739
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,815
But what are we going to do with him?

740
01:19:02,918 --> 01:19:05,546
Leave him. I'll inform
the magistrate later.

741
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:08,282
We have more important work to do.

742
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:09,823
Come on.

743
01:19:11,827 --> 01:19:13,351
Get moving.

744
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:37,981
Orders from the magistrate.
Suspected witches.

745
01:19:38,086 --> 01:19:39,815
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

746
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:25,195
I heard them.
Where are they taking them?

747
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:28,936
To the castle to test them.

748
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,334
Test them?

749
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:35,901
They're accused of witchcraft.

750
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,444
- Harcourt, you come with me.
- Yes, sir.

751
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:40,412
- Shall I look after him, sir?
- Yes, try and find him a physician.

752
01:20:40,515 --> 01:20:43,507
I've heard much of how
Hopkins conducts his interrogations.

753
01:20:43,618 --> 01:20:45,279
Come on, Harcourt.

754
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:04,432
All right, Stearne.

755
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:28,224
No!

756
01:21:34,502 --> 01:21:37,665
Well, Captain Marshall,
do you now confess?

757
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:43,710
Keep at it, Stearne.
You're doing God's work.

758
01:21:57,325 --> 01:22:00,624
Put her over here.
And you, Master Webb, help him.

759
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:23,169
Master Hopkins and his assistants,
are they here, man?

760
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:24,980
- That they are, sir.
- Well, let us pass, then.

761
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:26,644
You're here to help the Witchfinder?

762
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:29,053
- We're here to find him, yes.
- Have you a signed pass?

763
01:22:35,397 --> 01:22:40,699
Sara, I'm going to place this iron
on your back.

764
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:42,928
Should you faint or cry out,

765
01:22:43,038 --> 01:22:48,169
we can only take it that Satan has
intervened to spare you your agony.

766
01:22:48,977 --> 01:22:51,502
However, I could show mercy if...

767
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:57,580
If Captain Marshall were to confess
to witchcraft first.

768
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:59,653
But will you do it, sir?

769
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,220
I shall kill you.

770
01:23:02,323 --> 01:23:04,003
So, you have no
proper authorization, then.

771
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,151
What do you mean?

772
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,354
- From the magistrate. Authorization.
- Not here with us, no.

773
01:23:08,463 --> 01:23:10,055
Well, we'll go back and get one then.

774
01:23:10,165 --> 01:23:12,292
All right. Then I'll let you pass.

775
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:19,898
Master Webb,
go and see what is the matter.

776
01:23:20,008 --> 01:23:21,771
Yes, Master Hopkins.

777
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:24,144
What do we do, Matthew?

778
01:23:24,245 --> 01:23:27,043
We shall carry on with God's work
as before, man.

779
01:23:27,148 --> 01:23:28,740
And fetch Captain Marshall over here.

780
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:31,444
He shall kneel before his wife
and watch her suffer.

781
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:32,952
- But Matthew...
- Go do it, man!

782
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:22,434
Oh, God!

783
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,817
You took him away from me.
You took him from me.

784
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:50,830
You took him from me.
You took him from me!

785
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:53,264
You took him from me!

786
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,748
May God have mercy on us all.
