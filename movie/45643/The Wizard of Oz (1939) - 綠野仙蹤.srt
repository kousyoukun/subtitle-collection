片名  綠野仙蹤

2
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:54,992
近四十年來，這個故事給予年輕人的心靈
以可靠的幫助，時間也無法將其溫馨的
人生觀排除於風尚之外，為了回報
你們這些忠實於這個故事的人
…為了年輕人的心靈
…我們奉獻上這部影片

3
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:07,992
她沒跟來了，托托
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

4
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:09,702
她弄痛你了嗎？
Did she hurt you?

5
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,702
她試著那麼做，不是嗎？
She tried to, didn't she?

6
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:15,082
快點，我們去告訴亨利叔叔和艾姆嬸嬸
Come on. We'll go tell
Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

7
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,332
艾姆嬸嬸！
Aunt Em!

8
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,792
艾姆嬸嬸！
Aunt Em!

9
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:29,052
你聽聽看喀爾胥小姐對托托做的…
Listen to what Miss Gulch
did to Toto--

10
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:31,092
桃樂茜，拜託！我們正在算東西！
Dorothy, please!
We're counting!

11
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:34,012
- 但她打它…
- 現在別煩我們，甜心
-But she hit him--
-Don't bother us now, honey.

12
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:38,812
孵蛋器壞了，看來我們會損失許多小雞
The incubator's gone bad and we're
likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

13
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,892
可憐的小東西
That poor little thing.

14
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,812
但是喀爾胥小姐用耙打托托…
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

15
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:47,482
…因為她說托托每天都追逐著
她那只壞脾氣的老貓！
...because she says he chases
her nasty old cat every day!

16
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,782
…70只，桃樂茜，拜託！
--seventy.
Dorothy, please!

17
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:53,032
但它沒有每天這樣
不過一星期做個兩三次罷了
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.

18
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:56,952
而且它根本抓不到她的老貓
現在她說她會…
And he can't catch her old cat anyway.
Now she says she'll--

19
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,162
桃樂茜！我們正忙著啊
Dorothy! We're busy.

20
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:02,582
噢，好吧
Oh, all right.

21
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,672
- 她怎樣？
- 不要急
-How's she coming?
-Take it easy.

22
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:11,722
你壓到我的手指了！
You got my finger!

23
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,932
你為什麼不把你的手拿開？
Why don't you get your finger
out of the way?

24
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,762
- 你來了
- 就在我手指上！
-There you are.
-Right on my finger!

25
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:18,642
幸好不是你的頭！
Lucky it wasn't your head!

26
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:22,602
傑可，我要拿喀爾胥小姐怎麼辦？
就因為托托…
Zeke, what am l going to do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto--

27
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:25,152
聽著，甜心，我要去把豬趕進去
Listen, honey,
l got them hogs to get in.

28
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:29,522
你沒用腦筋
你可能認為你根本沒任何頭腦
You ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.

29
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,152
我腦筋好得很！
l have so got brains!

30
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:32,612
那你怎麼不用？
Why don't you use them?

31
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,912
別經過喀爾胥小姐的地方
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

32
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:38,872
那麼托托就不會跑進她的花園
而你也不會有麻煩了
Then Toto won't get in her garden,
and you won't get in no trouble.

33
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,832
噢，杭克，你根本沒在聽，算了吧
Oh, Hunk, you just
won't listen, that's all.

34
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,122
你知道你的頭腦可不是稻草做的
Well, your head ain't made
of straw, you know.

35
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:51,592
快進去，在我把你們當廉價賭本之前！
Get in there before l make
a dime bank out of you!

36
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,302
聽著，孩子…
Listen, kid...

37
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,352
…你想讓老喀爾胥那小母牛恐嚇你？
...are you gonna let that old Gulch
heifer try and buffalo you?

38
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,682
她並不是無所畏懼！
你要拿出點勇氣來
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.

39
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,352
我才不怕她
l'm not afraid of her.

40
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:08,482
下次她再口出惡言
走向她並且當面藐視她
Next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

41
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,572
那正是我要做的
That's what l'd do.

42
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,242
幫幫我，傑可！把我弄出這裡！
Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!

43
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,372
救命！
Help!

44
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:24,332
- 你還好吧，桃樂茜？
- 是的，我沒事
-Are you all right, Dorothy?
-Yes, l'm all right.

45
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:27,082
我掉進去，而傑可…
l fell in and Zeke--

46
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,882
喔，傑可，你就跟我一樣害怕！
Why, Zeke, you're just
as scared as l am!

47
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,172
你會讓只小豬把你變成懦夫嗎？
You gonna let a little pig
make a coward out of you?

48
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,262
看看你…
Look at you--

49
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,472
看這是什麼聊天聚會啊
什麼時候才會將工作做完？
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

50
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,682
我就知道三個農夫做一件工作
是成不了事的
l know three farm hands
that'll be out of a job!

51
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:43,852
桃樂茜剛才…
Dorothy was--

52
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:46,232
我看見你用粗劣手法修補那機器
黑克瑞
l saw you tinkering with
that contraption, Hickory.

53
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,982
- 你和杭克回去馬車那裡
- 好吧
-You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
-All right.

54
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:51,612
但有一天他們會為我立個雕像…
But someday they'll erect
a statue to me--

55
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,402
好了，現在別又開始為那擺姿勢了
Well, don't start posing for it now.

56
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,992
空著肚子無法工作！拿些小煎餅吧
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.

57
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,282
- 謝了，蓋爾夫人
- 只是油煎的
-Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
-Just fried.

58
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,452
你看，桃樂茜掉到這…
You see, Dorothy toppled into the--

59
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,832
桃樂茜不該到豬舍附近玩的！
lt's no place for Dorothy
around a pigsty!

60
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:07,332
喂餵那些豬
在它們擔心自己得了貧血之前！
Feed those hogs before they
worry themselves into anemia!

61
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,672
你知道喀爾胥小姐說
她準備怎麼對付託托嗎？
Do you know what Miss Gulch
said she was going to do to Toto?

62
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,422
- 她說她會…
- 別再胡思亂想了
-She said she'd--
-Stop imagining things.

63
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:18,512
你總是自尋煩惱
你只要在今天幫我們解決困難…
You're always in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...

64
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:22,302
…還有找一個你不會有麻煩的地方
...and find a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

65
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,682
一個沒有任何麻煩的地方
Someplace where there
isn't any trouble.

66
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:31,482
你認為真的有那樣的地方嗎，托托？
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

67
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,612
一定有
There must be.

68
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:39,322
那裡不是搭船或火車能到達的地方
lt's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

69
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:43,532
那地方離這裡很遠
lt's far, far away.

70
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,332
月亮之後…
Behind the moon...

71
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,792
…雨水的另一邊…
...beyond the rain....

蓋爾
Mr. Gale.

96
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,862
你好，喀爾胥小姐
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

97
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:23,532
我必須和你和你的太太談談桃樂茜
l want to see you and
your wife about Dorothy.

98
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,032
- 桃樂茜做了什麼？
- 她做了什麼？
-What has Dorothy done?
-What's she done?

99
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,492
我全身都好，除了我的腳被咬變跛之外
l'm all but lame from
the bite on my leg!

100
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:31,542
- 你是說她咬你？
- 不，是她的狗！
-You mean, she bit you?
-No, her dog!

101
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,832
她咬她的狗？
She bit her dog, eh?

102
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:36,672
不是
No.

103
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,922
那條狗是個威脅
我要捕捉它，以確定它被毀滅
That dog's a menace. l'm taking
him to make sure he's destroyed.

104
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,382
毀滅！托托？
Destroyed! Toto?

105
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,382
噢，你不能！你不會吧！
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

106
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:49,642
艾姆嬸嬸！亨利叔叔！
你們不會讓她這麼做吧，會嗎？
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

107
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:51,722
當然我們不會
Of course we won't.

108
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:53,272
我會嗎，艾姆？
Will we, Em?

109
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:54,932
拜託，艾姆嬸嬸！
Please, Aunt Em!

110
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,562
托托根本不知道它做錯了什麼
Toto didn't know he was
doing anything wrong.

111
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:02,232
我才是應該被處罰的人
罰我上床並不准吃晚餐
l'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.

112
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:05,442
交出那隻狗，否則我會告你
讓你失去你的農場
Hand over that dog or l'll bring
a suit that'll take your farm!

113
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,862
狗咬人違反法律對人的保障！
The law protects folks
against dogs that bite!

114
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,572
要她把它綁起來如何？它很溫和的
How about if she ties him up?
He's gentle.

115
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:14,452
- 對仁慈的人來說，那就夠了
- 那要由警長來決定
-With gentle people, that is.
-That's for the sheriff to decide.

116
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:19,002
這命令允許我帶走它
除非你想違抗法律
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you want to go against the law.

117
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:26,302
我們不會違抗法律
我很遺憾托托必須被帶走
We can't go against the law.
l'm afraid Toto has to go.

118
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:28,012
現在你瞭解原因了
Now you're seeing reason.

119
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:31,762
我要它放在這裡好帶走
這樣它就無法攻擊我
Here's what l'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

120
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,392
我不會讓你帶走它！
l won't let you take him!

121
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:34,642
你走開！
You go away!

122
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,772
我會親自咬你的！
l'll bite you myself!

123
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:41,812
你這邪惡的老巫婆！亨利叔叔
艾姆嬸嬸，別讓她帶走托托！
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto!

124
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,942
我有許可！把它給我！
l've got an order!
Let me have him!

125
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,982
把它放進籃子裡，亨利
Put him in the basket, Henry.

126
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:49,452
- 多明白事理！
- 不要，亨利叔叔
-The idea!
-Don't, Uncle Henry.

127
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,072
噢，托托！
Oh, Toto!

128
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,802
艾米拉·喀爾胥
就因為你擁有半個郡…
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county...

129
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,222
…並不代表你可以支配我們！
...doesn't mean you can
run the rest of us!

130
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:11,592
23年來我一直忍耐著
不想告訴你，我對你的看法
For 23 years l've been dying
to tell you what l thought of you!

131
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:12,802
而現在…
And now--

132
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:16,772
好吧，身為基督徒女子
我不能將那說出口！
Well, being a Christian woman,
l can't say it!

133
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,252
托托，親愛的！
Toto, darling!

134
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,292
我又得到你了！
l got you back!

135
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,922
你回來了！
You came back!

136
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,762
我真高興！
l'm so glad!

137
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:56,602
他們會馬上到這裡來抓你
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

138
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,272
我們必須離開！
We've got to get away!

139
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,232
我們得離家出走！
We've got to run away!

140
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,852
喔，喔，喔！過夜的訪客？
Well, well, well!
Houseguests, eh?

141
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,932
你會是怎樣的人呢？
And who might you be?

142
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,942
不，不，現在別告訴我！
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

143
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,942
讓我們瞧瞧
Let's see.

144
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:48,772
你正在喬裝旅行中
You're traveling in disguise.

145
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,692
不，不是那樣
No, that's not right.

146
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,282
你正要去拜訪某人
You're going on a visit.

147
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:55,532
不，我想那不對
No, l'm wrong.

148
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,282
你離家出走了
You're running away.

149
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,992
你怎麼猜出來的？
How did you guess?

150
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,502
馬勃爾教授從不用猜的，他就是知道！
Professor Marvel never guesses.
He knows!

151
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,582
現在，為什麼你會離家出走？
Now, why are you running away?

152
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,792
不，不，別告訴我
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

153
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:10,212
在家中他們不瞭解你
他們不知感激你
They don't understand you at home.
They don't appreciate you.

154
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:14,632
你想見識其它地方
大城市，大山，大海
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.

155
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:18,552
為什麼會這樣
好像你能讀出我的內心想法
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

156
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:22,022
托托，那很不禮貌！
我們還沒被邀請呢
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

157
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,432
它是受歡迎的
He's perfectly welcome.

158
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,312
就像隻狗對待另隻狗般，哼？
As one dog to another, huh?

159
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,152
現在，我們說到哪了？
Here now, where were we...?

160
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:34,242
為什麼我們不能跟著你
去看看歐洲的君王們？
Why can't we go with you
and see the crowned heads of Europe?

161
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:37,572
你有認識的？噢，你是說那回事…
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing....

162
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,122
沒先問過我的水晶之前
我是不會做任何事的
l never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

163
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:44,622
我們進去吧，我們會…
Let's go inside here. We'll--

164
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,622
進來吧，我會做給你看的
Just come along. l'll show you.

165
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,172
這就對了，這裡
That's right. Here.

166
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:49,672
就坐在這裡
Sit right down here.

167
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:50,712
那就是它
That's it.

168
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:56,512
這是同樣血統，魔力，可靠的水晶…
This is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal...

169
00:12:56,762 --> 00:13:01,562
…被歐塞裡斯及艾西斯神的祭司們
用於法老王之祭典日…
...used by the priests of lsis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...

170
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:06,772
…埃及艷後用來看見
凱撒及安東尼逼近的水晶
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

171
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,022
諸如此類等等
And so on, and so on.

172
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:14,032
你現在最好閉上你的眼睛一下子…
Now, you'd better close your eyes,
my child, for a moment...

173
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:17,822
…為了能跟造物主協調一致
...in order to be better in tune
with the lnfinite.

174
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:24,242
我們若沒辦法接觸造物主的話
是無法完成這些事的
We can't do these things without
reaching out into the lnfinite.

175
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,122
好了，可以了
Yes, that's all right.

176
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,882
現在你可以睜開眼睛了
我們將凝視著水晶內部
Now you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.

177
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:35,712
我看見的是什麼？
一座有尖木樁籬笆的房子…
What's this l see?
A house with a picket fence...

178
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,382
…還有一座有風向標的穀倉…
...and a barn with a weathervane...

179
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,392
…及一匹奔跑的馬
...of a running horse.

180
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:43,512
那是我們的農場！
That's our farm!

181
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:46,562
那裡有位女士
There's a woman.

182
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:51,562
她穿著件圓點花樣的連衣裙
她的表情看起來憂心忡忡的
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.

183
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,072
那是艾姆嬸嬸
That's Aunt Em.

184
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:55,232
是的，她的名字是艾米麗
Yes, her name is Emily.

185
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,822
對，她在做什麼？
That's right. What's she doing?

186
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:00,532
嗯，我沒辦法看得很清楚
Well, l can't quite see.

187
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:01,992
為什麼？她正在哭！
Why, she's crying.

188
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,662
有人傷害了她
Someone has hurt her.

189
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:07,002
有人令她傷心
Someone has just about
broken her heart.

190
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:08,082
我？
Me?

191
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:11,212
喔，那是她所深愛的人
Well, it's someone she loves very much.

192
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:13,462
某個她非常慈愛對待的人
Someone she's been very kind to.

193
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,882
某個在生病時她會悉心照顧的人
Someone she's taken care of in sickness.

194
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:21,392
我有次得了麻疹
她片刻不離的待在我身邊
l had the measles once, and she stayed
right by me every minute.

195
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,602
現在她在做什麼？
What's she doing now?

196
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,892
好的，她正…
Yes, she's--

197
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,352
這是什麼？
What's this?

198
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:29,482
為什麼？她將手放在她的心上
Why, she's putting her hand
on her heart!

199
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:33,062
她正對著床掉眼淚！
She's dropping down on the bed!

200
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,692
哦，就這樣了！水晶球已經變暗了
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.

201
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,782
你不會認為她真的病了吧，你會嗎？
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

202
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:43,702
- 我必須馬上回家！
- 我還以為你要跟我走
-l've got to go home right away!
-l thought you were going with me.

203
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:46,202
不，我必須馬上回到她身邊
No, l have to get to her right away!

204
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,542
快點，托托！快點！
Come on, Toto! Come on!

205
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:53,672
再見，馬勃爾教授，真是謝謝你！
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!

206
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:59,132
最好找個地方躲起來，斯勒韋斯特
有個風暴來襲了
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.

207
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,592
用農民的話來形容就像個大漏斗
A whopper, to speak in the
vernacular of the peasantry.

208
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:05,762
可憐的小孩，我希望她能平安到家
Poor little kid.
l hope she gets home all right.

209
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,362
把那些馬鬆開！
Get them horses loose!

210
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,652
黑克瑞在哪裡？黑克瑞！
Where's Hickory? Hickory!

211
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:21,242
該死的！
Doggone it!

212
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,572
那是個龍捲風！那是個龍捲風！
lt's a twister! lt's a twister!

213
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:34,122
桃樂茜！
Dorothy!

214
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,692
每個人都進去防風地窖！
Everybody in the storm cellar!

215
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:06,282
亨利，我找不到桃樂茜！
她在外面，在暴風圈內！
Henry, l can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!

216
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,372
我們現在無法去找她
We can't look for her now.

217
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:11,082
快點，進去防風地窖！快一點！
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!

218
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,152
艾姆嬸嬸！
Auntie Em!

219
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:53,202
艾姆嬸嬸！
Auntie Em!

220
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,752
亨利叔叔！
Uncle Henry!

221
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:16,542
我們一定是在龍捲風裡面！
We must be up inside the cyclone!

222
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:21,832
喀爾胥小姐！
Miss Gulch!

223
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,652
托托…
Toto...

224
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,902
…我感覺我們已經不在堪薩斯了
...l have a feeling we're not
in Kansas anymore.

225
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:07,002
我們一定已經飛越了彩虹！
We must be over the rainbow!

226
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,822
現在我知道我們真的不在堪薩斯了
Now l know we're not in Kansas.

227
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,162
你是個好巫婆或壞巫婆？
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

228
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:47,962
誰，我嗎？
Who, me?

229
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:50,382
我根本不是巫婆
l'm not a witch at all.

230
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:53,052
我是桃樂茜·蓋爾，從堪薩斯來的
l'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

231
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,462
它是不是巫婆？
ls that the witch?

232
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,132
誰，托托？托托是我的狗
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

233
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:02,102
我有點頭昏腦漲的！
蠻支金呼叫我，因為一個新巫婆…
l'm a little muddled. The Munchkins
called me because a new witch...

234
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:05,102
…剛把一座房子掉在東方壞巫婆身上
...just dropped a house on the
Wicked Witch of the East.

235
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:07,732
而那裡有座房子，還有你在這裡…
And there's the house,
and here you are...

236
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:11,812
…而那些就是東方壞巫婆留下的
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

237
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:17,112
蠻支金想知道
你是好巫婆還是壞巫婆？
What the Munchkins want to know is,
are you a good witch or a bad witch?

238
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:20,032
但是我已經告訴過你
我根本不是巫婆
But l've already told you,
l'm not a witch at all.

239
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:22,372
巫婆都是又老又醜
Witches are old and ugly.

240
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:25,492
那是什麼？
What was that?

241
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:29,292
蠻支金們，他們正在笑
因為我就是個巫婆
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because l am a witch.

242
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,672
我叫葛琳達，是北方巫婆
l'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

243
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:33,172
你是？
You are?

244
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,052
請原諒！
l beg your pardon!

245
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,972
但是我從未聽過有美麗的巫婆
But l've never heard
of a beautiful witch.

246
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:41,392
只有壞巫婆才是醜陋的
Only bad witches are ugly.

247
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,142
蠻支金們很高興…
The Munchkins are happy...

248
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:46,102
…因為你從東方壞巫婆手裡
解救了他們
...because you freed them from the
Wicked Witch of the East.

249
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:48,932
但如果你樂意的話
能告訴我「蠻支金」是什麼嗎？
But if you please,
what are Munchkins?

250
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:52,192
生活在這裡的小矮人
這裡是蠻支金國…
The little people who live here.
lt's Munchkinland...

251
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:54,862
…而你是他們的國家女英雄

Well, then, you'll have to walk.

370
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:49,182
蠻支金人會照顧你到蠻支金國邊界
The Munchkins will see you
to the border of Munchkinland.

371
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:53,902
還有記住讓紅鞋與你片刻不離…
And remember, never let those ruby
slippers off your feet for a moment...

372
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:57,732
…否則你將可要祈求西方壞巫婆
的憐憫了
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

373
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:01,072
但是我要怎麼開始到翡翠城呢？
But how do l start for Emerald City?

374
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:03,362
從起點開始總是最好的
lt's always best
to start at the beginning.

375
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:07,242
你所要做的就是跟隨著黃磚路
And all you do is
follow the Yellow Brick Road.

376
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:21,302
- 但那會發生什麼，如果我…
- 只要跟隨著黃磚路
-But what happens if l--

現在我該走哪條路？
Now which way do we go?

抱歉！那條是非常好的路
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.

誰那麼說的？
Who said that?

401

Don't be silly, Toto.

That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

404

當然，人們會走這兩條路的
Of course, people do go both ways.

喔，你真的說了些什麼，不是嗎？
Why, you did say something, didn't you?

406
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:46,152
你是故意那樣做的
還是你沒辦法做決定？
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

407
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:49,362

That's the trouble.
l can't make up my mind.

l haven't got a brain.

就能說一大些廢話，不是嗎？
But some people without brains

是的，我想你是對的
Yes, l guess you're right.

哦，我們還沒正式認識吧，對嗎？

-Very well, thank you.

你不能下來嗎？
Oh, dear. That must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

That's very kind of you.

噢，親愛的，我沒看到…
Oh, dear. l don't see....

當然，關於做事我不是很機靈…
Of course, l'm not bright

噢，是的！
Oh, yes!

這裡又有些從我身體裡跑出來了！
There goes some of me again!

429
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:54,012
那會弄痛你嗎？
Does it hurt you?

430
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:57,762
噢，不會！
我只要撿起它，再把它塞回去
l just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

431
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,272

My! lt's good to be free!

我嚇著你了嗎？
Did l scare you?

433
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,942
我只是以為你傷害到你自己

我沒嚇著你？

不，當然沒有
No, of course not.

You see?
l can't even scare a crow.

They come from miles around just to eat

Oh, l'm a failure, because

Do you think if l went,

我不敢說
l couldn't say.

468
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:06,232
但即使他不能，你也不會比現在更糟
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

469
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:09,352
- 對，那是真的
- 但也許你最好不要
-Yes, that's true.
-But maybe you better not.

470
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,902

也許會讓你惹上麻煩

Except a lighted match.

我不怪你
l don't blame you.

我寧願面對一整盒的火柴
But l'd face a whole box of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

476

我不會增添任何麻煩
因為我不必吃任何東西
l won't be any trouble,
because l don't eat a thing.

00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:34,302

And l won't try to manage things,

00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,432
蘋果！
Apples!

490
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,312
噢，看啊！
Oh, look!

491
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:41,912
你以為你在幹嘛？
What do you think you're doing?

492
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:47,372
我們已經走了很長的一段路
而我感到很飢餓，還有…
We've been walking a long ways
and l was hungry and--

493
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:49,252
是你在說話嗎？
Did you say something?

494
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,372
- 她很餓！
- 她很餓！
-She was hungry!
-She was hungry!

495
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,542
喜歡有人跑來並從你身上拿走東西嗎？
How would like to have someone come
along and pick something off of you?

496
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:57,002
噢，哎呀！
Oh, dear!

497
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:00,132
我又忘了我不是在堪薩斯
l keep forgetting l'm not in Kansas.

498
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:01,842
過來，桃樂茜
Come along, Dorothy.

499
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:04,262
你不會要那些蘋果的
You don't want any of those apples.

500
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:06,512
你是在暗示我的蘋果
不是它們應有的模樣？
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they ought to be?

501
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:10,432
你是在暗示我的蘋果
不是它們應有的模樣？
Oh, no! lt's just that she doesn't
like little green worms!

502
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:11,852
噢，你！
Oh, you!

503
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:18,902
我會讓你看怎樣得到蘋果的
l'll show you how to get apples.

504
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,032
萬歲！我想它辦到了！
Hooray! l guess that did it!

505
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,372
自個兒來吧
Help yourself.

506
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,602
當然，它是個人！
Why, it's a man!

507
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,192
用錫做的人！
A man made out of tin!

508
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:00,982
是的…！
Yes...!

509
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:03,782
看！
Look!

510
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:09,952
你說了什麼嗎？
Did you say something?

511
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:13,832
他說「油壺」
He said "oilcan."

512
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:15,502
什麼是油壺？
Oil can what?

513
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:17,082
油壺？
Oilcan?

514
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:21,002
在這裡
Here it is.

515
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,302
你希望從哪裡開始上油？
Where do you want to be oiled first?

516
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,052
他說從嘴巴
He said his mouth.

517
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,222
另一面
The other side.

518
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:46,242
謝天謝地！我又能講話了！
My goodness! l can talk again!

519
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:49,122
幫我的手臂上點油，拜託
肘部也上點
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.

520
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:51,292
這裡
Here.

521
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:56,082
那會痛嗎？
Did that hurt?

522
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:58,752
不會，那感覺好極了
No, it feels wonderful.

523
00:41:58,962 --> 00:42:01,252
我像這樣握著斧頭已經很久了
l've held that axe up for ages.

524
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:02,592
我的天！
Goodness!

525
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:05,262
你怎麼會搞成那樣子？
How did you ever get like this?

526
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:08,682
大約一年前…
About a year ago...

527
00:42:08,932 --> 00:42:10,602
…我正在砍著樹…
...l was chopping that tree...

528
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:12,932
…突然間開始下起雨來
...when suddenly it began to rain.

529
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:16,732
就在砍到一半的時候，我就蛈矰F
And right in the middle of a chop,
l rusted solid.

530
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:19,812
從那時我就保持那樣直到現在
And l've been that way ever since.

531
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:24,442
你現在很完美
You're perfect now.

532
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,532
我的脖子，我的脖子
My neck. My neck.

533
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:28,112
完美？
Perfect?

534
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,952
敲敲我的胸膛
如果你認為我是完美的
Bang on my chest
if you think l'm perfect.

535
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,372
開始吧，敲敲它！
Go ahead, bang on it!

536
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:36,542
美極了！
Beautiful!

537
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,212
回音真棒！
What an echo!

538
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:39,712
它是空的
lt's empty.

539
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:44,212
錫匠忘了給我一顆心
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

540
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:46,512
沒有心？
No heart?

541
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:47,882
沒有心
No heart.

542
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,802
所有都是空的
All hollow.

543
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:59,272
∮當一個人是個空水壺
他應該無所畏懼∮
When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle

544
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:02,232
∮而我卻悲傷莫名∮
And yet I'm torn apart

545
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:08,402
∮因為我認為
我可以成為人類∮
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human

546
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:11,282
∮只要我有顆心∮
If I Only Had a Heart

547
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:17,412
∮會很溫柔，我會是文質彬彬
而且非常多愁善感的∮
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental

548
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,292
∮關於愛及藝術∮
Regarding love and art

549
00:43:21,962 --> 00:43:26,552
∮我會與麻雀及邱比特為友∮
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows

550
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:30,012
∮只要我有顆心∮
If I Only Had a Heart

551
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,062
∮我想像，一座陽台∮
Picture me
A balcony

552
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:39,562
∮上面，有個聲音低聲吟唱∮
Above, a voice sings low

553
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,812
∮你在哪裡，羅密歐？∮
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

554
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:46,072
∮我聽到一陣心跳∮
I hear a beat

555
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:49,112
多甜蜜啊！
How sweet!

556
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:54,122
∮就讓那情緒表達出來吧
不管是妒忌還是摯愛∮
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion

557
00:43:54,372 --> 00:43:56,662
∮真正感受其中的滋味∮
And really feel the part

558
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:03,632
∮我將能保持青春及活力充沛
而且我會用拉鏈將它鎖藏起來∮
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper

559
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:07,672
∮只要我有顆心∮
If I Only Had a Heart

560
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:34,192
- 你還好吧？
- 我還有些不靈活
-Are you all right?
-l'm a little rusty yet.

561
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:35,482
噢，親愛的！
Oh, dear!

562
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,152
真是奇妙啊！
That was wonderful!

563
00:45:39,032 --> 00:45:40,612
你知道…
You know...

564
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:44,202
…我們在想為什麼你不跟著我們…
...we were wondering why
you couldn't come with us...

565
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:46,282
…去跟大法師要個心
...to ask the Wizard for a heart.

566
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:49,412
如果當我們到達那裡
大法師卻不能給我一個心呢？
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there.

567
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:51,082
噢，但他會的！
Oh, but he will!

568
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,662
他一定要！
He must!

569
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:55,332
我們已經走了這麼遠的一段路
We've come such a long way already.

570
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,262
你稱那叫「遠」？
You call that long?

571
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,472
哎呀，你們才剛開始罷了！
Why, you've just begun!

572
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,142
一起幫這小女士，好嗎，我的好紳士？
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

573
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:11,522
嗯，離她遠些…
Well, stay away from her...

574
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,852
…否則我會拿你來填床墊！
...or l'll stuff a mattress with you!

575
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,272
還有你！
And you!

576
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:19,152
我會用你當蜂窩！
l'll use you for a beehive!

577
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,072
接著，稻草人！要玩球嗎？
Here, scarecrow! Want to play ball?

578
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:29,202
接著，稻草人！要玩球嗎？
Fire!
l'm burning! l'm burning!

579
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,552
我才不怕她
l'm not afraid of her.

580
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:47,392
我會照顧你直到見著大法師
不管我會不會得到個頭腦！
l'll see you get safely to the Wizard,
whether l get a brain or not!

581
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:49,722
拿我填床墊？！
Stuff a mattress with me!

582
00:46:50,972 --> 00:46:53,892
我會照顧你直到到達大法師那裡
不管我會不會得到個心！
l'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether l get a heart or not.

583
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:55,772
當蜂窩！呸！
Beehive! Bah!

584
00:46:56,152 --> 00:46:59,482
讓她試試用我來做蜂窩吧！
Let her try and make
a beehive out of me!

585
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:04,532
你們是任何人一生
所能擁有的最好的朋友
You're the best friends
anybody ever had.

586
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:09,202
那有趣的是
我覺得我已經認識你們一輩子了
And it's funny, but l feel as if
l've known you all the time.

587
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,542
- 但我之前沒可能見過你們，可能嗎？
- 我不知道怎麼會那樣
-But l couldn't have, could l?
-l don't see how.

588
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:15,962
當我被填充並縫製的時候
你並不在附近
You weren't around when l was
stuffed and sewn together.

589
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:19,882
而我生蚽蒂b那裡一段很長的時間
And l was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

590
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,882
儘管如此，我希望我可以記得
Still, l wish l could remember.

591
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,422
但是我想那並沒有關係
But l guess it doesn't matter anyway.

592
00:47:25,632 --> 00:47:27,472
我們現在彼此認識了
We know each other now.

593
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:29,682
- 對極了
- 是啊
-That's right.
-We do.

594
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:31,602
- 到奧茲？
- 到奧茲！
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

595
00:47:31,812 --> 00:47:35,562
∮我們出發去見大法師
神奇的奧茲大法師∮
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

596
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:39,102
∮我們聽說他是天才中的天才
如果未曾有過這樣的天才∮
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

597
00:47:39,352 --> 00:47:42,572
∮如果未曾，如果未曾有過這樣的天才
那奧茲大法師就是一個，因為∮
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

598
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:46,152
∮因為，因為，因為，因為，因為∮
Because, because, because
Because, because

599
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:48,862
∮因為他所做的神奇美妙的事情∮
Because of the wonderful things he does

600
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:53,742
∮我們出發去見大法師
神奇的奧茲大法師∮
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

601
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,982
我不喜歡這森林
l don't like this forest.

602
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:23,862
它陰暗而且令人毛骨悚然！
lt's dark and creepy!

603
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,590
當然，我不知道…
Of course, l don't know...

604
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,260
…但是我想在它變亮之前
它會越來越暗
...but l think it'll get darker
before it gets lighter.

605
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,640
你想我們會碰上什麼野獸嗎？
Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

606
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,810
可能會
We might.

607
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,890
有吃稻草的野獸嗎？
Animals that eat straw?

608
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,730
有些，但大部分的野獸是獅子
老虎和熊
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

609
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,320
- 獅子！
- 還有老虎？
-Lions!
-And tigers?

610
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,780
還有熊！
And bears!

611
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,150
獅子，老虎和熊！噢，我的天！
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

612
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,070
∮獅子，老虎和熊！∮
Lions and tigers and bears!

613

Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

616
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,360
把手臂抬起來！把手臂抬起來！
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

617
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,320
你們誰先上？
Which one of you first?

618
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,910
我可以讓你們兩個一起來
如果你們希望
l'll fight you both together,
if you want.

619
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,240
我可以將一隻腳掌綁在背後跟你們打！
l'll fight you with
one paw tied behind my back!

620
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,580
我可以用一隻腳跟你們打！
l'll fight you on one foot!

621
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,250
我可以閉著眼睛跟你們打！
l'll fight you with my eyes closed!

622
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,540
拔出斧頭來對付我，哼？
Pulling an ax on me, eh?

623
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,420
偷襲我，哼？當然…
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why....

624
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,680
- 走開，別煩我們
- 噢，害怕了，哼？
-Go away and let us alone.
-Oh, scared, huh?

625
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,300
害怕，哼？
Afraid, huh?

626
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,770
你在罐頭裡能保持新鮮多久呢？
How long can you stay fresh
in that can?

627
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,650
快點，起來和戰鬥吧
你這顫抖的廢物堆積場
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard.

628
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,150
抬起你的手，你這歪斜的乾草袋！
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

629
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,980
那是人身攻擊，獅子
That's getting personal, Lion.

630
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,990
是啊，起來並給它個教訓
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

631
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,620
對於教訓他，你有什麼問題？
What's wrong with you teaching him?

632
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,740
嗯，我很難瞭解他
Well, l hardly know him.

633
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,580
我一定會抓到你的，小東西！
l'll get you anyway, peewee!

634
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,470
你真是丟臉！
Shame on you!

635
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,510
你為什麼要那樣做？
我又沒有咬他
What did you do that for?
l didn't bite him.

636
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,510
沒有，但你試著去做
No, but you tried to.

637
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,560
找稻草人的碴就已經很糟糕了
不用再說去找只小狗的碴…
lt's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but picking on little dogs....

638
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:48,110
喔，你也不必跑來打我，不是嗎？
Well, you didn't have to go
and hit me, did you?

639
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,690
我的鼻子在流血嗎？
ls my nose bleeding?

640
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,650
當然沒有
Well, of course not.

641
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,110
我的天，都是你小題大作害的！
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!

642
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,580
當然，當你在附近找些
比你弱小的東西的碴…
Naturally, when you go around picking
on things weaker than you are....

643
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,580
你除了像個懦夫外，什麼都不是！
You're nothing but a big coward!

644
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,080
你是對的，我是個懦夫！
You're right, l am a coward!

645
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,500
我根本毫無勇氣
l haven't any courage at all.

646
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,340
我甚至會被自己嚇到！
l even scare myself!

647
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,420
看看我眼睛下的眼袋
Look at the circles under my eyes.

648
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,510
我已經有幾個星期沒睡覺了
l haven't slept in weeks.

649
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
難道你沒有試著數羊嗎？
Why don't you try counting sheep?

650
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,180
那沒有任何幫助，我怕它們
That doesn't do any good.
l'm afraid of them.

651
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,270
噢，那太糟了
Oh, that's too bad.

652
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,400
你想大法師也能幫它嗎？
You think the Wizard
could help him too?

653
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,440
我看不出為什麼不行
l don't see why not.

654
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,360
跟我們一起來吧
Come along with us.

655
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,400
我們正要去見大法師
去幫他得到個心
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.

656
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,610
- 還有他的頭腦
- 他可以給你一些勇氣
-And him a brain.
-He could give you some courage.

657
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,370
你們跟只膽小的獅子在一起
會不會覺得丟臉？
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

658
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,960
我會
l would.

659
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,420
不，當然不會
No, of course not.

660
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,380
哇，你真是太好了
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

661
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,050
我的生命簡直無法讓人忍受下去了
My life has been simply unbearable.

662
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,680
哦，現在沒關係了
Well, it's all right now.

663
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,470
大法師將會解決每件事
The Wizard'll fix everything.

664
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,140
我已經忍受很久了
lt's been in me so long.

665
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,440
我將告訴你我的感受
l just gotta tell you how l feel.

666
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,190
快點！
Come on!

667
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,480
∮相信我，小姑娘，那真的很悲哀
當你天生膽小…∮
Yeah, it's sad, believe me, missy
When you're born to be a sissy

668
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,940
∮…沒有活力及激情∮
Without the vim and verve

669
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,370
∮但我可以展現我的英勇無畏∮
∮當一頭雄獅，而不是一隻老鼠∮
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse

670
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,040
∮只要我有勇氣∮
If I Only Had the Nerve

671
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,500
∮我恐怕無法否認
我只是頭漂亮的獅子∮
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion

672
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,090
∮我的命運不該如此∮
A fate I don't deserve

673
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,050
∮我該像暴風雪般勇猛
我該像蜥蜴般高貴∮
-I'd be brave as a blizzard
-I'd be gentle as a lizard

674
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,130
∮我該像沙囊般伶俐∮
I'd be clever as a gizzard

675
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,760
∮如果我要找的大法師
真的是個巫師∮
If the Wizard is a wizard
who will serve

676
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,640
∮那我就能得到一個頭腦∮
Then I'm sure to get a brain

677
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,730
∮- 一個心∮
∮- 一個家∮
-A heart
-A home

678
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,350
∮勇氣！∮
The nerve!

679
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,820
∮我們出發去見大法師
神奇的奧茲大法師∮
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

680
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,450
∮我們聽說他是天才中的天才
如果未曾有過這樣的天才∮
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

681
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,870
∮如果未曾，如果未曾有過這樣的天才
那奧茲大法師就是一個，因為∮
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was

∮因為，因為，因為，因為，因為∮
Because, because, because
Because, because

683
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,750
∮因為他所做的神奇美妙的事情∮
Because of the wonderful things he does

684
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,880
∮我們出發去見大法師
神奇的奧茲大法師∮
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

685
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,180
所以你們不想接受警告？
So you won't take warning, eh?

686
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,270
那對你們來說真是再糟不過了
All the worse for you, then!

687
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,440
我將會馬上對付你們！
l'll take care of you now
instead of later!

688
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,230
當我獲得那紅寶石鞋…
When l gain those ruby slippers...

689
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,070
…我將會變成奧茲國最偉大的人
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!

690
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,990
現在，我的美人們…
And now, my beauties...

691
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,240
…放點毒藥到裡頭，我想
...something with poison in it, l think.

692
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,580
加點毒藥到裡頭
With poison in it.

693
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,580
一定要能吸引眼睛的注意
以及聞起來讓人昏昏欲睡！
But attractive to the eye
and soothing to the smell!

694
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,630
罌粟
Poppies.

695
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,760
罌粟
Poppies!

696
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,220
罌粟會讓他們睡著
Poppies will put them to sleep.

697
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,390
睡著…
Sleep....

698
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,720
現在他們將會睡著
Now they'll sleep.

699
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,460
那是翡翠城！
There's Emerald City!

700
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,090
噢，我們就要到了！終於！終於啊！
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!

701
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,430
它真是美麗，不是嗎？
就跟我想的一樣
lt's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like l knew it would be.

702
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,850
居住在像那樣的地方
他一定真的是個神奇的大法師！
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that!

703
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,810
我們還等什麼？
What are we waiting for?

704
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,810
- 沒事！大家快點！
- 是呀，讓我們用跑的！
-Nothing! Let's hurry!
-Yes, let's run!

705
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,820
來吧！來吧！
Come on! Come on!

706
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,070
快點！快點！
Hurry! Hurry!

707
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,450
走啊！看！
Go! Look!

708
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,370
快點！
Come on!

709
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,710
看看這景色，真是美極了！
Look at the scenery. lt's wonderful!

710
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,290
翡翠城！
Emerald City!

711
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,380
發生了什麼事？
What's happening?

712
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,050
那是什麼？
What is it?

713
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,430
我好想睡覺，我再也跑不動了
l can't run anymore.
l'm so sleepy.

714
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,180
把手給我們，我們會拉著你
Give us your hands.
We'll pull you.

715
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,640
噢，不要，拜託
Oh, no, please.

716
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,930
我必須休息一下子
l have to rest for just a minute.

717
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,270
托托，托托在哪裡？
Toto. Where's Toto?

718
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,150
你現在不能休息，我們離那裡很近了
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

719
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,820
別哭！你會讓你自己再次生蛌滿I
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!

720
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:49,870
仔細想想，打個瞌睡也不錯
Coming to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

721
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,830
你不要也開始這樣！
Don't you start it too!

722
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,660
我們應該背著桃樂茜！
We ought to carry Dorothy!

723
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,000
我不認為我行，但我們可以試試
l don't think l could,
but we could try.

724
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,460
現在看著他！那太可怕了！
Now look at him!
lt's terrible!

725
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,750
過來，錫人，幫幫我
Here, Tin Man, help me.

726
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,010
這真是太可怕了！
This is terrible!

727
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,590
我無法移動她，連一寸都不能！
這是個咒語，一定是！
l can't budge her an inch!
This is a spell, this is!

728
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,640
那是壞巫婆做的！我們要怎麼辦？
lt's the Wicked Witch!
What'll we do?

729
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,180
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

730
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,560
這種時候像那樣大喊是沒有用的
lt's no use screaming
at a time like this.

731
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,770
沒有人會聽見的！救命！救命！
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!

732
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,730
救命！
Help!

733
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,070
下起雪來了！
lt's snowing!

734
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,240
不，那不是！
No, it isn't!

735
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,990
是的，那是！
Yes, it is!

736
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,700
也許那會有幫助！
Maybe that'll help!

737
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,830
噢，但那不可能有幫助！
Oh, but it couldn't help!

738
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,710
那有幫助！
lt does help!

739
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,500
桃樂茜，你醒來了！
Dorothy, you're waking up!

740
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,930
我們遇上了不尋常的天氣，不是嗎？
Unusual weather we're having,
ain't it?

741
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,020
看，他又蛈矰F！
Look. He's rusted again!

742
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:02,440
- 把油灌給我，快點！
- 這裡
-Give me the oilcan, quick!
-Here.

743
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,730
- 他蛈矰F
- 拿去
-He is rusted.
-Here.

744
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,820
- 這裡
- 快點！
-Here.
-Quick!

745
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,320
該死的！我詛咒她！

還離家出走，傷了她的心

馬勃爾教授說她病了

…而那全是我的錯

925
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,070
我將永遠不會原諒自己

永遠，永遠，永遠

l'll get you into the Wizard somehow.

929
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,670
來吧，我自己也曾經經歷過一次
像艾姆嬸嬸這樣的事情
Come on.
l had an Aunt Em myself once.

930
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,770
等一下，夥伴們
Wait a minute, fellas.

931
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,820
我剛在想，我似乎不這麼想見大法師
l was just thinking, l don't want
to see the Wizard this much.

932
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,990
我最好還是在外面等你們
l better wait for you outside.

933
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,950
- 又怎麼了？
- 他只不過又害怕了
-What's the matter?
-He's just scared again.

934
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,660
難道你不知道大法師會給你勇氣？
Don't you know the Wizard will
give you courage?

935
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:08,080
我太害怕了
所以不敢開口要求他給我勇氣
l'd be too scared to ask him for it.

936
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:10,500
好吧，那麼我會幫你要求的
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.

937
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,790
我寧願待在外頭
l'd sooner wait outside.

938
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,750
為什麼？為什麼？
Why? Why?

939
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,800
因為我還是感到害怕！
Because l'm still scared!

940
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,510
- 發生什麼事？
- 有人拉著我的尾巴
-What happened?
-Somebody pulled my tail.

941
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,560
你自己拉的啦
You did it yourself.

942
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,430
過來
Here.

943
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,310

走向前來！
Come forward!

945
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,530
當它結束時再告訴我！
Tell me when it's over!

946
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,790
看看那個，看看那個！
Look at that. Look at that!

947
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,300
我要回家！

噢！我的老天！
Oh! Jiminy crickets!

…知道你們為什麼而來

01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,050
走向前…

01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,670
…錫人！
...Tin Man!

962
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,600
你膽敢到這裡向我要求顆心，是嗎？
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

963
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,730
你這叮叮噹噹作響的…
You clinking, clanking, clattering...

964
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,610
…廢棄舊物組合的廢物！
...collection of caliginous junk!

965

你知道…
You see...

968
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,910
…不久之前，我們沿著黃磚道…
...a while back, we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road--

969
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,410
住嘴！
Quiet!

970

還有你，稻草人…
And you, Scarecrow...

01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,980
喔？
Well?

978
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,450
你應該為你自己感到羞愧…
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...

979
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,620
…當他來請求你的幫助時

981
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,420
…傲慢的傢伙！
...whippersnapper!

982
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:01,210
仁慈的奧茲有意願准許你們的請求…
The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests.

983
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,380
什麼？他說了什麼？
What's that? What'd he say?

984
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,590
他說了什麼？
What'd he say?

985
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,220
但首先，你們必須證明你們值得…
But first, you must prove
yourselves worthy...

986
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:13,180
…完成一件小事來證明
...by performing a very small task.

987
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,890
將西方巫婆的掃帚帶來給我
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

988
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,110
但為了取得掃帚，我們將必須殺了她
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it.

989
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,780
帶給我她的掃帚…
Bring me her broomstick...

990
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,900
…而我將准許你們的請求
...and l'll grant your requests.

991
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,410
現在離開吧！
Now go!

992
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,160
但要是她先殺了我們呢？
But what if she kills us first?

993
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,660
我說「離開」！
l said go!

994
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:23,840
「假如我是你，我會回頭」
"l'd turn back if l were you."

995
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,410
我相信這裡到處都是幽靈
l believe there's spooks around here.

996
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:57,830
那太荒謬了！
That's ridiculous!

997
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,910
幽靈！那太愚蠢了
Spooks! That's silly.

998
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,460
你不相信有幽靈？
Don't you believe in spooks?

999
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,500
不，當然，只有…
No. Why, only--

1000
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,600
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

1001
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,680
我真的相信有幽靈！
l do believe in spooks.

1002
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:19,730
我相信，我相信，我相信，我相信
l do, l do, l do, l do.

1003
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,980
我真的相信有幽靈
我相信，我相信，我相信，我相信！
l do believe in spooks.
l do, l do, l do, l do, l do!

1004
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:29,530
在我消滅你們之前
你會寧願去相信比那更多的東西
You'll believe in more than that
before l'm finished with you.

1005
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:34,570
帶你的軍隊去將那女孩和她的狗
抓來給我
Take your army and bring me
that girl and her dog.

1006
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,120
其他人就隨你高興怎麼處置
但是我要她活著
Do what you like with the others,
but l want her alive.

1007
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,790
他們不會給你惹麻煩的
我可以向你保證
They'll give you no trouble.
l promise you that.

1008
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,710
我會讓些小蟲當先鋒，將他們解決掉
l've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

1009
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:49,590
要特別當心那紅寶石鞋
那是我最想到的東西
Take special care of those slippers.
l want those most of all.

1010
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,550
現在，飛吧！飛吧！
Now, fly! Fly!

1011
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,380
將女孩和她的紅寶石鞋帶來給我
Bring me that girl and her slippers!

1012
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:27,750
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

1013
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,090
馬上滾開！
Go away now!

1014
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:34,720
托托！托托！救命！
Toto! Toto! Help!

1015
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,820
救命！救命！救命！
Help! Help! Help!

1016
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:54,950
你怎麼了？
What happened to you?

1017
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,530
他們把我的腳扯下丟到那裡！
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

1018
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:00,280
然後他們又拿走我的胸膛丟到那裡！
Then they took my chest
and threw it over there!

1019
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,950
你被丟的到處都是！
That's you all over.

1020
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,870
他們確實將填充物從你身體扯出來
They sure knocked
the stuffings out of you.

1021
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,540
別呆站在那裡！將我組合起來
我們必須去找桃樂茜！
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!

1022
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:09,040
嗯，讓我瞧瞧…
Now, let's see....

1023
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,050
多麼可愛的小狗啊
What a nice little dog.

1024
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,470
還有你，我親愛的
And you, my dear.

1025
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,470
多麼意外的榮幸啊
What an unexpected pleasure.

1026
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,730
在我孤獨的時候來拜訪我
你真是體貼啊
lt's so kind of you to visit me
in my loneliness.

1027
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,360
你想對我的狗怎麼樣？把它還我！
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back!

1028
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,940
別太著急了，我的小美人
All in good time, my little pretty.

1029
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,900
別太著急了
All in good time.

1030
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,990
請你把狗還我
Please give me back my dog.

1031
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,490
當然，當然…
Certainly, certainly...

1032
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,620
…只要你把紅寶石鞋給我
...when you give me those slippers.

1033
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,910
但好巫婆告訴過我不能這麼做
But the Good Witch told me not to.

1034
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,830
那好吧
Very well.

1035
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,880
把籃子丟到河裡
Throw that basket in the river.

1036
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:54,250
不要！你可以拿走你的舊鞋子
但是把托托還給我！
No! You can have your old slippers,
but give me back Toto!

1037
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,210
那就對了，小女孩
That's a good little girl.

1038
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,840
我知道你很明白事理的！
l knew you'd see reason!

1039
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:05,520
我很抱歉！我無法辦不到
我是否仍能要回我的狗呢？
l'm sorry! l didn't do it.
Can l still have my dog?

1040
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:09,690
不！我真是傻瓜，我應該要記得…
No! Fool that l am,
l should have remembered...

1041
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:12,480
…這鞋子永遠無法脫下來…
...those slippers will
never come off...

1042
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:16,490
…只要你還活著
...as long as you're alive.

1043
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:20,570
但是那並不是我所困擾的
而是應該怎麼做這件事
But that's not what's worrying me.
lt's how to do it.

1044
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,280
這些事必須很巧妙地完成…
These things must be done delicately...

1045
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,660
…否則你會被咒語所傷害
...or you hurt the spell.

1046
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:29,290
- 跑，托托，快跑！
- 抓住它，你這笨蛋！
-Run, Toto, run!
-Catch him, you fool!

1047
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,970
快跑，托托，快跑！
Run, Toto, run!

1048
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,600
它跑掉了！它跑掉了！
He got away! He got away!

1049
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,350
我不知道你們哪個應得多些！
Which is more than you will!

1050
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,020
詛咒，你和你的狗！
Drat, you and your dog!

1051
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:54,860
你給我帶來的麻煩遠大於你的價值
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth.

1052
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,860
但是現在，那很快就會結束了！
But it'll soon be over now!

1053
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,990
你看見這沒？
Do you see that?

1054
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,700
這就是你還能活著的時間
That's how much longer
you've got to be alive.

1055
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:06,950
而那不會太久的，我的小美人
那不會太久的！
And it isn't long, my pretty.
lt isn't long!

1056
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,750
我可不能等一輩子才拿到鞋子！
l can't wait forever
to get those shoes!

1057
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,730
我很害怕
l'm frightened.

1058
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,480
我很害怕，艾姆嬸嬸！我很害怕
l'm frightened, Auntie Em!
l'm frightened.

1059
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:44,570
你在哪裡呢？
Where are you?

1060
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,910
是我，那是艾姆嬸嬸
lt's me. lt's Auntie Em.

1061
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,250
我們正在找你，你在哪裡呢？
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?

1062
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
我在奧茲這裡，艾姆嬸嬸
l'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

1063
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:55,000
我被關在巫婆的城堡裡…
l'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

1064
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:58,130
…而我正在想辦法回家找你
艾姆嬸嬸！
...and l'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

1065
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,880
噢，艾姆嬸嬸，別離開！
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

1066
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,720
我很害怕！
l'm frightened!

1067
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,430
回來！回來！
Come back! Come back!

1068
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,640
「艾姆嬸嬸，艾姆嬸嬸！回來！」
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"

1069
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:11,270
我會給你艾姆嬸嬸，我的美人！
l'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

1070
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,840
看！托托在那裡！
Look! There's Toto!

1071
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,880
它從哪裡來的？
Where'd he come from?

1072
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,590
當然，難道你不明白？
Why, don't you see?

1073
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,720
它來帶我們去找桃樂茜
He's come to take us to Dorothy.

1074
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:49,220
快點，夥伴們！
Come on, fellas!

1075
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,870
我希望我的力量能夠維持下去
l hope my strength holds out.

1076
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,580
我希望你的尾巴夠強韌
l hope your tail holds out.

1077
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,340
那是什麼？
What's that?

1078
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,260
那是壞巫婆的城堡！
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!

1079
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:33,140
- 桃樂茜在這可怕的城堡裡？
- 我痛恨她在裡面的想法
-Dorothy's in that awful place?
-l hate to think of her in there.

1080
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:36,060
- 我們必須救她出來
- 現在別哭
-We've got to get her out.
-Don't cry now.

1081
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:39,520
我們沒帶著油壺
而你發出的嘎吱聲好像蠻需要它的
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've
been squeaking enough as it is.

1082
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,770
他們是誰？他們是誰？
Who's them? Who's them?

1083
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,920
- 我有個計劃能進去
- 好極了，他有計劃了
-l've got a plan how to get in there.
-Fine. He's got a plan.

1084
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:02,960
- 你必須帶領我們
- 對啊
-And you're gonna lead us.
-Yeah.

1085
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,340
- 我？
- 是的，你
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1086
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:09,090
- 我要從那裡救她出來？
- 是啊
-l gotta get her out of there?
-That's right.

1087
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,850
好吧，為了桃樂茜我會去那裡
All right, l'll go in there
for Dorothy.

1088
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,930
不管有沒有壞巫婆…
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

1089
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,690
…不管有沒有警衛
我都會把他們撕成碎片
...guards or no guards,
l'll tear them apart.

1090
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:23,070
也許我沒辦法活著出來
但我還是會去那裡
l may not come out alive,
but l'm going in there.

1091
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,030
- 我只要求你們做一件事
- 什麼事？
-There's only one thing l want you to do.
-What's that?

1092
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,320
當我失去知覺時跟我說話
Talk me out of it.

1093
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,570
- 不，你別！
- 噢，不要
-No, you don't!
-Oh, no.

1094
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,450
- 嗯，等等
- 上！
-Now, wait a minute.
-Up!

1095
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,680
來吧，我想到另外一個主意了
Come on, l've got another idea.

1096
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:40,430
你想的主意會受到歡迎嗎
像順道拜訪之類的？
Do you think it would be polite,
dropping in like this?

1097
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,090
我們現在要去哪裡？
Where do we go now?

1098
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,180
那裡！
There!

1099
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,860
等等！我們最好肯定一下
桃樂茜，你在那裡嗎？
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1100
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:33,900
是我們！
lt's us!

1101
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,110
是的！
Yes!

1102
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,080
是我！巫婆將我關在裡面！
lt's me! She's locked me in!

1103
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,660
我們要救她出來！打開這門！
We gotta get her out! Open the door!

1104
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:42,870
噢，快點！請快點！
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!

1105
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,830
沙漏快要漏完了！
The hourglass is almost empty!

1106
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,540
往後站！
Stand back!

1107
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:07,440
我就知道你們會來！我就知道你們會！
l knew you'd come!
l knew you would!

1108
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:10,110
快點，我們快沒時間了！
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

1109
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:23,500
這麼快就要走了？
Going so soon?

1110
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,540
我可不是這麼聽說的
l wouldn't hear of it.

1111
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:29,630
當然，我的小宴會才剛要開始
Why, my little party's just beginning.

1112
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,590
我們被設計了，像抓老鼠的…陷阱！
Trapped.
Trapped like mice...rats!

1113
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,890
對極了，別馬上傷害他們
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.

1114
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:47,640
我們要讓他們先稍微的考慮一下
We'll let them think about it
a little first.

1115
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,910
抓住他們！抓住他們！
Seize them! Seize them!

1116
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,910
阻止他們，你們這些笨蛋！
Stop them, you fools!

1117
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,990
抓住他們！抓住他們！
Seize them! Seize them!

1118
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,210
他們往那裡去了！
現在我們會逮到他們的！
There they go! Now we've got them!

1119
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,550
你們一半走這條路，你們走那條路
Half you go this way,
half you go that way.

1120
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,880
快點！快點！
Hurry! Hurry!

1121
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:28,730
現在我們要往哪裡走？
Where do we go now?

1122
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,060
這條路，快點！
This way. Come on!

1123
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,490
回去！回去！
Back! Back!

1124
01:25:58,170 --> 01:25:59,590
很好！
Well!

1125
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,760
將玫瑰圍個圈，一小塊地方充滿了刺
Ring-around the rosie,
a pocket full of spears!

1126
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:05,560
你認為你會是只可愛的狐狸嗎？
Thought you'd be pretty foxy,
didn't you?

1127
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,890
她將會是最後一個死的
所以將會目睹其他三人的下場
The last to go will see
the first three go before her.

1128
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,110
還有她那骯髒的狗也一樣！
And her mangy little dog too!

1129
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,780
來點小火怎樣，稻草人？
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

1130
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,450
救命！我著火了！我著火了！
它燒起來了！
Help! l'm burning! l'm burning!
lt's burning!

1131
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:31,000
別碰那水！
Don't touch that water!

1132
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,880
你這可惡的小傢伙！
看看你幹了什麼好事！
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!

1133
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,010
我在融化！融化了！
l'm melting! Melting!

1134
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,300
這是什麼樣的世界！這是什麼樣的世界！
What a world! What a world!

1135
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:44,260
誰會想到像你一樣乖巧的小女孩…
Who would've thought
a good little girl like you...

1136
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,930
…能夠毀滅我完美的邪惡？
...could destroy
my beautiful wickedness?

1137
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,680
注意啊！注意啊！
Look out! Look out!

1138
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:51,730
我要死了
l'm going.

1139
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,870
她死了，你已經殺了她
She's dead. You've killed her.

1140
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,660
我並不是故意要殺死她
l didn't mean to kill her.

1141
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,420
真的，我不是有心的
Really, l didn't.

1142
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,210
只不過是他著火了，事情就這樣發生了
lt's just that he was on fire.

1143
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,840
向桃樂茜致敬！壞巫婆死了！
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1144
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:20,840
致敬！向桃樂茜致敬！
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!

1145
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:23,010
壞巫婆死了！
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1146
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,260
這掃帚
The broom.

1147
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:27,430
- 我們能擁有它嗎？
- 請你們拿走它吧
-May we have it?
-Please. And take it with you.

1148
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,720
非常謝謝你！
Thank you so much!

1149
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,600
現在我們能回去跟大法師說
壞巫婆已經死了
Now we can go tell the Wizard
the Wicked Witch is dead!

1150
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,310
壞巫婆死了！
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1151
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,980
我能相信我的眼睛嗎？
Can l believe my eyes?

1152
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:39,020
你們帶了什麼回來？
Why have you come back?

1153
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,280
請看，先生
我們已經完成了您的吩咐
Please, sir. We've done
what you told us.

1154
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:47,740
我們把壞巫婆的掃帚帶回來給您
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch.

1155
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,910
我們還融化了她
We melted her.

1156
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,750
你們消滅了她？非常的機智
You liquidated her, eh?
Very resourceful.

1157
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,960
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

1158
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:59,540
所以我們希望您遵守您對我們的承諾
如果您滿意的話
So we'd like you to keep
your promise to us, if you please.

1159
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,050
別急，別急！
Not so fast. Not so fast!

1160
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,800
我必須要思考一下這事
l'll have to give the matter
a little thought.

1161
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:08,930
先離開，明天再來
Go away and come back tomorrow.

1162
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,350
明天？
Tomorrow?

1163
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,270
但是我想馬上回家！
But l want to go home now!

1164
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,190
你已經有過充分的時間
You've had plenty of time already.

1165
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,610
別激怒偉大又強大的奧茲！
Do not arouse the wrath
of the Great and Powerful Oz!

1166
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,780
我說了，明天再來！
l said come back tomorrow!

1167
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:27,030
如果你真的偉大又強大
你應該遵守您的承諾
if you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises.

1168
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:30,990
你在質疑評判偉大的奧茲嗎？
Do you presume to criticize
the Great Oz?

1169
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,540
你這忘恩負義的動物！
You ungrateful creatures!

1170
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:37,500
你們要感到幸運
我讓你們明天來謁見我…
Think yourselves lucky that l'm
giving you audience tomorrow...

1171
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,920
…而不是20年後！
...instead of 20 years from now!

1172
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,380
偉大的奧茲是這麼說的！
The Great Oz has spoken!

1173
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,600
別管那個在布簾之後的人
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.

1174
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:54,020
偉大又…奧茲是這麼說的！
The Great and--
Oz has spoken.

1175
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:55,430
你是誰？
Who are you?

1176
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,310
好吧，我就是偉大又強大的奧茲大法師
Well, l am the Great and Powerful
Wizard of Oz.

1177
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,070
你就是？
You are?

1178
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,650
我才不相信你！
l don't believe you!

1179
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,360
很不幸這是真的
這裡除了我之外，並沒有其他巫師
l'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.

1180
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:09,870
你這個騙子！
You humbug!

1181
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:13,580
是的，那的確是，我是個騙子
Yes, that's exactly so. l'm a humbug.

1182
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,710
你是個很壞的人！
You're a very bad man!

1183
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,630
不，親愛的，我是個很好的人
No, my dear. l'm a very good man.

1184
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,590
卻是個很差勁的巫師
l'm just a very bad wizard.

1185
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,840
那你答應錫人的心怎麼辦？
What about the heart
you promised Tin Man?

1186
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,970
還有你答應獅子的的勇氣呢？
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?

1187
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,010
還有稻草人的頭腦呢？
And Scarecrow's brain?

1188
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:34,180
噢，每個人都有一顆頭腦
它是再平凡不過的東西
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1189
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:37,310
每隻卑微的動物，不管是在地上爬的…
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1190
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,770
…或者潛行於海裡的，都有一顆腦袋
...or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain.

1191
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:43,150
在我原來生活的地方，我們有許多大學…
Back where l come from,
we have universities...

1192
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,820
…大量知識存放的地方
人們到那裡學習，以便成為偉大思想家
...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1193
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:51,200
他們能深入思考哲理
他們並沒有比你更加聰明
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

1194
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:55,160
但是他們有一樣是你沒有的…
一張文憑
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1195
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:59,460
因此，根據我所被賦予的權力…
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

1196
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:03,500
…得自普魯瑞本士大學董事會…
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

1197
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,920
…我在此授與你…
...l hereby confer upon you...

1198
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:09,630
…Th，D，榮譽學位
...the honorary degree of Th.D.

1199
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,880
Th，D，是什麼？
Th.D.?

1200
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,430
就是「思想學博士」
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1201
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:16,520
一個等腰三角形兩邊的平方根和…
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1202
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:19,640
…等於另一邊的平方根
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1203
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,810
噢，天啊！真令人欣喜！
Oh, joy! Rapture!

1204
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,610
我得到我的頭腦了！
l've got a brain!

1205
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,020
我要如何才能報答你呢？
How can l thank you enough?

1206
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,820
喔，你不需要！
而你，我的好朋友…
Well, you can't.
As for you, my fine friend...

1207
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:31,240
…你是混亂思想的受害者
...you're a victim
of disorganized thinking.

1208
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:35,120
你受困於一種錯覺
認為你面對危險會逃跑是因為…
You are under the delusion
that because you run away from danger...

1209
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:39,250
…你沒有勇氣
你把勇氣與智慧搞混了
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1210
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,460
回到我原來生活之處
我們有一種叫做「英雄」的人
Back where l come from,
we have men who are called "heroes."

1211
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:46,750
每年一度，他們會拿出塵封的堅忍勇氣…
Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

1212
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,170
…列隊在大街上遊行
...and parade it down the main street.

1213
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:52,300
他們並不比你勇敢
And they have no more courage
than you have.

1214
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:56,760
但是他們有一樣是你沒有的…
一枚勳章
But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

1215
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,220
因此…
Therefore...

1216
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:02,020
…為了你勇敢的帶領
非凡的氣魄…
...for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valor...

1217
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,310
…出色的勇氣
都表現在在對抗壞巫婆時…
...conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

1218
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,610
…我授與你「三重十字勳章」
...l award you the Triple Cross.

1219
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:11,490
你現在勇氣軍團的一員了
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage.

1220
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,910
啊，各位，我是言語無法形容的
Shucks, folks, l'm speechless.

1221
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,080
還有你，我鍍鋅的朋友，你要求顆心
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

1222
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,960
你不知道你沒有心是多麼的幸運
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1223
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:30,300
心一點都不實用
除非它們能被做成牢不可破
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

1224
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,220
但是我還是想要一顆
But l still want one.

1225
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:37,640
回到我原來生活之處
那裡有人除了行善外，終日無所適事
Back where l come from, there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1226
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:40,350
他們被稱為愛…
They are called phil--

1227
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,350
慈善家，可是他們的情感也沒比你多
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts
are no bigger than yours.

1228
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,110
但是他們有一樣你沒有的東西…
一紙褒揚狀
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A testimonial.

1229
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,240
因此，在考慮過你的仁慈…
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

1230
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,200
…我很榮幸在這裡呈遞給你…
...l take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

1231
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:58,950
用一件小紀念品
表達我們的尊重及感情
...with a small token
of our esteem and affection.

1232
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,910
請記住，我的金屬朋友…
And remember, my sentimental friend...

1233
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,420
…愛心並不是以你愛多少人來評估…
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

1234
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:08,460
…而是以有多少人愛你來判定
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

1235
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,630
它在滴答響！
lt ticks!

1236
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,220
聽著！看啊，它在滴答響！
Listen! Look, it ticks!

1237
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,470
讀讀我的獎章怎麼說的…「勇氣」
Read what my medal says. "Courage."

1238
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,100
可那不就是事實嗎！
可那不就是事實嗎！
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!

1239
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:23,930
噢，它們都棒極了
Oh, they're all wonderful.

1240
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,350
嘿，那桃樂茜呢？
Hey, what about Dorothy?

1241
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,310
是啊，桃樂茜怎麼辦？
Yes, how about Dorothy?

1242
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,480
下一個是桃樂茜呀
Dorothy next.

1243
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:34,190
我不認為黑袋子裡有任何能幫我的
l don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1244
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,660
你逼我做一個重大的決定
You force me into
a cataclysmic decision.

1245
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:40,700
我必須親自帶桃樂茜回堪薩斯
這是唯一的辦法
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas
is for me to take her myself.

1246
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,790
噢，你會嗎？你可以嗎？
Oh, will you? Could you?

1247
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:48,380
但是操控它你夠靈巧嗎？
But are you clever enough to manage it?

1248
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,630
孩子，你傷了我的感情了！
Child, you cut me to the quick!

1249
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,710
我可是個老堪薩斯人…
l'm an old Kansas man myself...

1250
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,550
…誕生及成長於西部荒野之地…
...born and bred
in the western wilderness...

1251
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,850
…奇跡仙境巡迴表演公司的
最傑出之首席氣球駕駛員
...premier balloonist par excellence to
the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

1252
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:04,850
直到有一天在表演同溫層操控技巧…
Until one day, while performing
feats of stratospheric skill...

1253
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,350
…文明世界從沒人嘗試過…
...never before attempted
by civilized man...

1254
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,810
…一個不幸的現象發生了
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.

1255
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,110
氣球無法順利的回到順風
The balloon failed
to return to the fair.

1256
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,150
它發生了？
lt did?

1257
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,320
那不會讓你害怕嗎？
Weren't you frightened?

1258
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:18,160
你在談論一個曾當面譏笑死神…
You are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death...

1259
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,950
…嘲笑厄運和在大災難仍舊大笑的人
我完全嚇呆了
...sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe. l was petrified.

1260
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,830
突然間風向變了…
Suddenly the wind changed...

1261
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,290
…氣球漂浮下來
進入這高貴的城市…
...and the balloon floated down
into this noble city...

1262
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:33,590
…奧茲的人們立刻擁立我為
首位高級大法師！
...where l was instantly acclaimed Oz,
the first wizard deluxe!

1263
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,720
經過他們幾次請求，我接受了工作…
Times being what they were,
l accepted the job...

1264
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:41,140
…留下我的氣球
抗拒立刻逃走的念頭
...retaining my balloon
against the advent of a quick getaway.

1265
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,430
而用那氣球，親愛的桃樂茜…
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...

1266
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,600
…你和我將回到那唯一的土地
...you and l will return to
the land of E Pluribus Unum.

1267
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,570
我的朋友們，我說，我的朋友們！
My friends. l mean, my friends!

1268
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:07,080
這絕對是前所未有的展示…
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown...

1269
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:09,160
…盡它所能
...be that as it may.

1270
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:13,000
我，你們的大法師
破 啊丟啦 噎得 噎而踏…
l, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...

1271
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,550
…將搭船去從事一次冒險的…
...am about to embark
upon a hazardous...

1272
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,550
…和從技術上無法解釋的旅行…
...and technically
unexplainable journey...

1273
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,720
…以進入外同溫層！
...into the outer stratosphere!

1274
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,770
經過與我的巫師朋友們…
To confer, converse...

1275
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:30,560
…親密的協商討論
...and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

1276
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:34,310
我在此頒布命令
And l hereby decree
that until what time...

1277
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,820
在我回來之前…
...if any, that l return...

1278
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:41,700
…將由有著優越頭腦的稻草人
...the Scarecrow, by virtue
of his highly superior brains...

1279
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:43,700
代替我統治…
...shall rule in my stead...

1280
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:48,450
…並由善良的錫人及勇敢的獅子
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

1281
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,540
從旁協助
...and the Lion,
by virtue of his courage.

1282
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:55,250
像服從我一樣的服從他們
Obey them as you would me.

1283
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,750
謝謝你
Thank you.

1284
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,510
托托，回來！
Come back!

1285
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,590
別丟下我一個人走，我會馬上回來
Don't go without me.
l'll be right back.

1286
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,930
攔住那隻狗！
Stop that dog!

1287
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:10,730
這是非常不規則的程序
而且絕對是史無前例的！
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1288
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:12,270
打開我的出口！
Ruined my exit!

1289
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,100
回來！回來！
Come back! Come back!

1290
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:16,820
別丟下我！回來，拜託！
Don't go without me!
Please come back!

1291
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:20,280
我無法回去！我不知道這怎麼操作！
l can't come back!
l don't know how it works!

1292
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:21,860
再見，各位！
Goodbye, folks!

1293
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:23,490
再見！
Goodbye!

1294
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,160
現在我再也回不了家了
Now l'll never get home.

1295
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,330
留下來跟我們在一起，桃樂茜
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1296
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,210
我們都愛你
We all love you.

1297
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,920
我們都不想你離開
We don't want you to go.

1298
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,380
你真是體貼…
That's very kind of you...

1299
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:43,760
…但是這裡永遠不會像堪薩斯一樣
...but this could never be like Kansas.

1300
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:47,890
一定要讓艾姆嬸嬸別再擔心
到底我發生什麼事
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1301
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,220
噢，稻草人，我該怎麼辦？
Oh, Scarecrow, what am l going to do?

1302
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,140
看！
Look!

1303
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:56,440
這裡有人能幫助你！
Here's someone who can help you!

1304
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,220
你會幫我嗎？你能幫我嗎？
Will you help me? Can you help me?

1305
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:34,390
你再也不需要求助了
You don't need help any longer.

1306
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,440
你早就有力量回去堪薩斯了
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1307
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:38,610
我有？
l have?

1308
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,440
你之前為什麼不告訴她？
Why didn't you tell her before?

1309
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:44,650
因為她不會相信我
她必須靠自己學會
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1310
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,110
你學到了什麼，桃樂茜？
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1311
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,290
我想那是…
l think that it...

1312
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:56,500
…光想見到亨利叔叔和艾姆嬸嬸
是不夠的
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1313
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:01,290
還有如果我未曾
再次尋找我心底的渴望…
And it's that if l ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1314
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,880
…我將無法看得比我家後院更遠…
...l won't look any further
than my own back yard...

1315
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,340
…因為如果它不在我心裡…
...because if it isn't there...

1316
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:10,680
…我從來就沒真的失去過它
...l never really lost it
to begin with.

1317
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:11,970
是這樣嗎？
ls that right?

1318
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,850
始終就是那樣
That's all it is.

1319
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:17,190
但是那是如此容易！
我早該幫你想到才對
But that's so easy!
l should've thought of it for you.

1320
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,940
我早就應該感覺到它在我心底
l should've felt it in my heart.

1321
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:21,110
她必須自己去發現這件事
She had to find it out for herself.

1322
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,690
現在那紅寶石鞋會在兩秒內帶你回家
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

1323
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,570
- 托托也是？
- 托托也是
-Toto too?
-Toto too.

1324
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,780
- 馬上？
- 任何時間，只要你想要
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

1325
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:31,160
噢，親愛的
Oh, dear.

1326
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:33,540
那真是美妙得不像真的！
That's too wonderful to be true!

1327
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:39,880
沒想到道別會是這麼困難
lt's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

1328
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,380
我愛你們所有人
l love you all too.

1329
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:46,550
再見，錫人
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1330
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:49,260
別哭
Don't cry.

1331
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,180
你會衒o一塌糊塗的
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1332
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:56,140
拿去，這是你的油壺
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1333
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:58,690
再見
Goodbye.

1334
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,650
現在我確定我得到了一顆心了…
Now l know l've got a heart...

1335
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,810
…因為它正在破碎了
...because it's breaking.

1336
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:07,650
再見，獅子
Goodbye, Lion.

1337
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,530
我知道那是不對的…
l know it isn't right...

1338
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:13,490
…但是我還是會懷念
這一路來你大喊救命的樣子…
...but l'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1339
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,160
…在你找到你的勇氣之前
...before you found your courage.

1340
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:20,330
如果不是你，我可能永遠找不到它
l would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1341
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,840
我想我會最懷念你
l think l'll miss you most of all.

1342
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,930
你準備好了沒？
Are you ready now?

1343
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,940
說再見，托托
Say goodbye, Toto.

1344
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:44,520
是的，我準備好了
Yes, l'm ready now.

1345
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,320
現在閉上你的眼睛…
Then close your eyes...

1346
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:49,440
…並且用你的鞋跟相碰三次…
...and tap your heels
together three times...

1347
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,740
…並在內心告訴自己…
...and think to yourself...

1348
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:57,040
…「沒有地方能跟家一樣」
..."There's no place like home.

1349
01:38:57,290 --> 01:39:00,410
沒有地方能跟家一樣
There's no place like home."

1350
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,130
沒有地方能跟家一樣
There's no place like home.

1351
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,670
沒有地方能跟家一樣
There's no place like home.

1352
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:29,990
醒醒，寶貝
Wake up, honey.

1353
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,620
桃樂茜，親愛的，是艾姆嬸嬸，親愛的
Dorothy, dear. lt's Aunt Em, darling.

1354
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
噢，艾姆嬸嬸，真的是你！
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1355
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:50,050
- 是的，親愛的
- 哈囉，您好！有人在家嗎？
-Yes, darling.
-Hello there! Anybody home?

1356
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:54,180
我順道來拜訪，因為我聽說小女孩
被大龍捲風抓走了…
l dropped by because l heard
the little girl got caught in the big--

1357
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:56,140
現在看起來她沒事了
She seems all right now.

1358
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:57,930
她被大力碰撞過
She got quite a bump.

1359
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:00,470
我們還有點擔心她會離我們而去
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

1360
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:03,390
但是我真的離開了你
不過那是件麻煩事兒
But l did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1361
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,650
我試了好多天才能回來
And l tried to get back for days!

1362
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,730
哪裡，哪裡，現在乖乖的躺好
There, there, lie quiet now.

1363
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:10,980
你只不過是做了個惡夢
You just had a bad dream.

1364
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:12,740
記得我嗎…
Remember me...

1365
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,070
…你的老夥伴，杭克？
...your old pal, Hunk?

1366
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,780
還有我…
And me...

1367
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,950
…黑克瑞？
...Hickory?

1368
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,700
你不會忘了我的臉吧，你會嗎？
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1369
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,540
但是那不是個夢
But it wasn't a dream.

1370
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:23,830
它是一個真實的地方
lt was a place.

1371
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,710
而你，你，你，你…
And you and you and you...

1372
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,590
…還有你也在哪裡
...and you were there.

1373
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,920
但是你們不可能在那裡的，不是嗎？
But you couldn't have been, could you?

1374
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,010
我們夢到許多無聊的事情，當我們…
We dream lots of silly things
when we--

1375
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:38,300
不，艾姆嬸嬸，這是真的
活生生的地方
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1376
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:41,350
我還記其中有些不是很好…
And l remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1377
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,640
…但大部分都很美麗
...but most of it was beautiful.

1378
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:47,600
但是我一直對每個人說同樣的話
「我要回家」
But just the same, all l kept saying
to everybody was, "l want to go home!"

1379
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:49,820
而他們就送我回來了
And they sent me home.

1380
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,650
沒有人相信我嗎？
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1381
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,860
我們當然相信你，桃樂茜
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1382
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,370
無論怎樣，托托，我們到家了！
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1383
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,660
家！
Home!

1384
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,540
這是我的房間…
And this is my room...

1385
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:03,250
…還有你們全在這裡
...and you're all here.

1386
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,580
我將永遠永遠不再離開這裡…
And l'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1387
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:09,250
…因為我愛你們
...because l love you all.

1388
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:12,420
還有，噢，艾姆嬸嬸…
And oh, Auntie Em...

1389
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,510
…沒有任何地方能像家一樣！
...there's no place like home!
