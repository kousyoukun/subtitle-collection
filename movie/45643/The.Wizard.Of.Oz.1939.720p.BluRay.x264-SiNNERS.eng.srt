1
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:07,992
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

2
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:09,702
Did she hurt you?

3
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,702
She tried to, didn't she?

4
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:15,082
Come on. We'll go tell
Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

5
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,332
Aunt Em!

6
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,792
Aunt Em!

7
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:29,052
Listen to what Miss Gulch
did to Toto--

8
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:31,092
Dorothy, please!
We're counting!

9
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:34,012
-But she hit him--
-Don't bother us now, honey.

10
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:38,812
The incubator's gone bad and we're
likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

11
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:40,892
That poor little thing.

12
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:43,812
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

13
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:47,482
...because she says he chases
her nasty old cat every day!

14
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,782
--seventy.
Dorothy, please!

15
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:53,032
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.

16
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:56,952
And he can't catch her old cat anyway.
Now she says she'll--

17
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,162
Dorothy! We're busy.

18
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:02,582
Oh, all right.

19
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,672
-How's she coming?
-Take it easy.

20
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:11,722
You got my finger!

21
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,932
Why don't you get your finger
out of the way?

22
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,762
-There you are.
-Right on my finger!

23
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:18,642
Lucky it wasn't your head!

24
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:22,602
Zeke, what am l going to do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto--

25
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:25,152
Listen, honey,
l got them hogs to get in.

26
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:29,522
You ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.

27
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,152
l have so got brains!

28
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:32,612
Why don't you use them?

29
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,912
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

30
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:38,872
Then Toto won't get in her garden,
and you won't get in no trouble.

31
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,832
Oh, Hunk, you just
won't listen, that's all.

32
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,122
Well, your head ain't made
of straw, you know.

33
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:51,592
Get in there before l make
a dime bank out of you!

34
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,302
Listen, kid...

35
00:03:56,802 --> 00:04:00,352
...are you gonna let that old Gulch
heifer try and buffalo you?

36
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,682
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.

37
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,352
l'm not afraid of her.

38
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:08,482
Next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

39
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,572
That's what l'd do.

40
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,242
Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!

41
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,372
Help!

42
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:24,332
-Are you all right, Dorothy?
-Yes, l'm all right.

43
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:27,082
l fell in and Zeke--

44
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,882
Why, Zeke, you're just
as scared as l am!

45
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:35,172
You gonna let a little pig
make a coward out of you?

46
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,262
Look at you--

47
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,472
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

48
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,682
l know three farm hands
that'll be out of a job!

49
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:43,852
Dorothy was--

50
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:46,232
l saw you tinkering with
that contraption, Hickory.

51
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,982
-You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
-All right.

52
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:51,612
But someday they'll erect
a statue to me--

53
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,402
Well, don't start posing for it now.

54
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,992
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.

55
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,282
-Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
-Just fried.

56
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,452
You see, Dorothy toppled into the--

57
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,832
lt's no place for Dorothy
around a pigsty!

58
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:07,332
Feed those hogs before they
worry themselves into anemia!

59
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,672
Do you know what Miss Gulch
said she was going to do to Toto?

60
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,422
-She said she'd--
-Stop imagining things.

61
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:18,512
You're always in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...

62
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:22,302
...and find a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

63
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,682
Someplace where there
isn't any trouble.

64
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:31,482
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

65
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,612
There must be.

66
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:39,322
lt's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

67
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:43,532
lt's far, far away.

68
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,332
Behind the moon...

69
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,792
...beyond the rain....

70
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:54,632
Somewhere Over the Rainbow

71
00:05:56,132 --> 00:05:59,132
Way up high

72
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:05,932
There's a land that I heard of

73
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:09,692
Once in a lullaby

74
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:16,862
Somewhere Over the Rainbow

75
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:21,032
Skies are blue

76
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:27,872
And the dreams that you dare to dream

77
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:32,752
Really do come true

78
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:37,422
Someday I'll wish upon a star

79
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:42,632
And wake up where the clouds
are far behind me

80
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:48,472
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

81
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,602
Away above the chimney tops

82
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,732
That's where you'll...

83
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:59,032
...find me

84
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:05,782
Somewhere Over the Rainbow

85
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:10,662
Bluebirds fly

86
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:17,752
Birds fly Over the Rainbow

87
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:21,422
Why then...

88
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:27,102
...oh, why can't I?

89
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:42,152
If happy little bluebirds fly

90
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,952
Beyond the rainbow

91
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:48,782
Why, oh, why...

92
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:52,582
...can't I?

93
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:17,942
Mr. Gale.

94
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,862
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

95
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:23,532
l want to see you and
your wife about Dorothy.

96
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,032
-What has Dorothy done?
-What's she done?

97
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,492
l'm all but lame from
the bite on my leg!

98
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:31,542
-You mean, she bit you?
-No, her dog!

99
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,832
She bit her dog, eh?

100
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:36,672
No.

101
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,922
That dog's a menace. l'm taking
him to make sure he's destroyed.

102
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,382
Destroyed! Toto?

103
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,382
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

104
00:08:46,632 --> 00:08:49,642
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

105
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:51,722
Of course we won't.

106
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:53,272
Will we, Em?

107
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:54,932
Please, Aunt Em!

108
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,562
Toto didn't know he was
doing anything wrong.

109
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:02,232
l'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.

110
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:05,442
Hand over that dog or l'll bring
a suit that'll take your farm!

111
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,862
The law protects folks
against dogs that bite!

112
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,572
How about if she ties him up?
He's gentle.

113
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:14,452
-With gentle people, that is.
-That's for the sheriff to decide.

114
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:19,002
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you want to go against the law.

115
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:26,302
We can't go against the law.
l'm afraid Toto has to go.

116
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:28,012
Now you're seeing reason.

117
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:31,762
Here's what l'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

118
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,392
l won't let you take him!

119
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:34,642
You go away!

120
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,772
l'll bite you myself!

121
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:41,812
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto!

122
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,942
l've got an order!
Let me have him!

123
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,982
Put him in the basket, Henry.

124
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:49,452
-The idea!
-Don't, Uncle Henry.

125
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:52,072
Oh, Toto!

126
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,802
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county...

127
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,222
...doesn't mean you can
run the rest of us!

128
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:11,592
For 23 years l've been dying
to tell you what l thought of you!

129
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:12,802
And now--

130
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:16,772
Well, being a Christian woman,
l can't say it!

131
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,252
Toto, darling!

132
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,292
l got you back!

133
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:46,922
You came back!

134
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,762
l'm so glad!

135
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:56,602
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

136
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,272
We've got to get away!

137
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,232
We've got to run away!

138
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,852
Well, well, well!
Houseguests, eh?

139
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,932
And who might you be?

140
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,942
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

141
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,942
Let's see.

142
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:48,772
You're traveling in disguise.

143
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,692
No, that's not right.

144
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,282
You're going on a visit.

145
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:55,532
No, l'm wrong.

146
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,282
You're running away.

147
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,992
How did you guess?

148
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,502
Professor Marvel never guesses.
He knows!

149
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,582
Now, why are you running away?

150
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,792
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

151
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:10,212
They don't understand you at home.
They don't appreciate you.

152
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:14,632
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.

153
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:18,552
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

154
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:22,022
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

155
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:24,432
He's perfectly welcome.

156
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,312
As one dog to another, huh?

157
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,152
Here now, where were we...?

158
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:34,242
Why can't we go with you
and see the crowned heads of Europe?

159
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:37,572
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing....

160
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,122
l never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

161
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:44,622
Let's go inside here. We'll--

162
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,622
Just come along. l'll show you.

163
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,172
That's right. Here.

164
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:49,672
Sit right down here.

165
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:50,712
That's it.

166
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:56,512
This is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal...

167
00:12:56,762 --> 00:13:01,562
...used by the priests of lsis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...

168
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:06,772
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

169
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,022
And so on, and so on.

170
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:14,032
Now, you'd better close your eyes,
my child, for a moment...

171
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:17,822
...in order to be better in tune
with the lnfinite.

172
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:24,242
We can't do these things without
reaching out into the lnfinite.

173
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:26,122
Yes, that's all right.

174
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,882
Now you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.

175
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:35,712
What's this l see?
A house with a picket fence...

176
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,382
...and a barn with a weathervane...

177
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:41,392
...of a running horse.

178
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:43,512
That's our farm!

179
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:46,562
There's a woman.

180
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:51,562
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.

181
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,072
That's Aunt Em.

182
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:55,232
Yes, her name is Emily.

183
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,822
That's right. What's she doing?

184
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:00,532
Well, l can't quite see.

185
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:01,992
Why, she's crying.

186
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,662
Someone has hurt her.

187
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:07,002
Someone has just about
broken her heart.

188
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:08,082
Me?

189
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:11,212
Well, it's someone she loves very much.

190
00:14:11,462 --> 00:14:13,462
Someone she's been very kind to.

191
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,882
Someone she's taken care of in sickness.

192
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:21,392
l had the measles once, and she stayed
right by me every minute.

193
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,602
What's she doing now?

194
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,892
Yes, she's--

195
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,352
What's this?

196
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:29,482
Why, she's putting her hand
on her heart!

197
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:33,062
She's dropping down on the bed!

198
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,692
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.

199
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,782
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

200
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:43,702
-l've got to go home right away!
-l thought you were going with me.

201
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:46,202
No, l have to get to her right away!

202
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,542
Come on, Toto! Come on!

203
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:53,672
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!

204
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:59,132
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.

205
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,592
A whopper, to speak in the
vernacular of the peasantry.

206
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:05,762
Poor little kid.
l hope she gets home all right.

207
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:16,362
Get them horses loose!

208
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,652
Where's Hickory? Hickory!

209
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:21,242
Doggone it!

210
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,572
lt's a twister! lt's a twister!

211
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:34,122
Dorothy!

212
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,692
Everybody in the storm cellar!

213
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:06,282
Henry, l can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!

214
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,372
We can't look for her now.

215
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:11,082
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!

216
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,152
Auntie Em!

217
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:53,202
Auntie Em!

218
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,752
Uncle Henry!

219
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:16,542
We must be up inside the cyclone!

220
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:21,832
Miss Gulch!

221
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,652
Toto...

222
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,902
...l have a feeling we're not
in Kansas anymore.

223
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:07,002
We must be over the rainbow!

224
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,822
Now l know we're not in Kansas.

225
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:45,162
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

226
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:47,962
Who, me?

227
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:50,382
l'm not a witch at all.

228
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:53,052
l'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

229
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,462
ls that the witch?

230
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,132
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

231
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:02,102
l'm a little muddled. The Munchkins
called me because a new witch...

232
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:05,102
...just dropped a house on the
Wicked Witch of the East.

233
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:07,732
And there's the house,
and here you are...

234
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:11,812
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

235
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:17,112
What the Munchkins want to know is,
are you a good witch or a bad witch?

236
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:20,032
But l've already told you,
l'm not a witch at all.

237
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:22,372
Witches are old and ugly.

238
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:25,492
What was that?

239
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:29,292
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because l am a witch.

240
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,672
l'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

241
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:33,172
You are?

242
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,052
l beg your pardon!

243
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,972
But l've never heard
of a beautiful witch.

244
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:41,392
Only bad witches are ugly.

245
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,142
The Munchkins are happy...

246
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:46,102
...because you freed them from the
Wicked Witch of the East.

247
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:48,932
But if you please,
what are Munchkins?

248
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:52,192
The little people who live here.
lt's Munchkinland...

249
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:54,862
...and you are their national heroine.

250
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:58,942
lt's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.

251
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:03,412
Come out, come out
Wherever you are

252
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:08,792
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star

253
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:16,752
She fell from the sky
She fell very far

254
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:21,632
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star

255
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:26,102
Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star

256
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:32,022
She brings you good news

257
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:34,482
Or haven't you heard?

258
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:37,862
When she fell out of Kansas

259
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:41,282
A miracle occurred

260
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:46,992
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this

261
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:50,502
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch

262
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:53,962
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch

263
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:57,382
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch

264
00:23:57,632 --> 00:24:00,762
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch

265
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:03,932
And oh, what happened then was rich

266
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:08,012
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch

267
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,932
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

268
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:16,152
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

269
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,482
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch

270
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,612
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

271
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:27,412
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

272
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:31,702
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch

273
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:36,042
Of what was once the Wicked Witch

274
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:44,222
We thank you very sweetly

275
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:46,642
For doing it so neatly

276
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:49,352
You've killed her so completely

277
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:52,722
That we thank you very sweetly

278
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:58,192
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

279
00:25:02,112 --> 00:25:05,612
Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

280
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:08,622
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

281
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:13,292
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

282
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,462
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead

283
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,712
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

284
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:24,762
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

285
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:28,182
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

286
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:31,682
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead

287
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:55,912
As mayor of the Munchkin City

288
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:59,212
In the county of the Land of Oz

289
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:03,132
I welcome you most regally

290
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:06,672
But we've got to verify it legally

291
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,382
-To see
-To see?

292
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,012
-If she
-If she?

293
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:11,932
Is morally, ethically

294
00:26:12,182 --> 00:26:15,432
-Spiritually, physically
-Positively, absolutely

295
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:20,022
Undeniably and reliably dead

296
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:30,492
As coroner I must aver

297
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:33,412
I thoroughly examined her

298
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:36,502
And she's not only merely dead

299
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:39,832
She's really most sincerely dead

300
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,462
Then this is a Day of lndependence...

301
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:47,552
...for all the Munchkins
and their descendants.

302
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:48,592
lf any!

303
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:53,932
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

304
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:58,022
Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

305
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:00,732
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

306
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:05,072
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

307
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:07,862
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead

308
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:11,992
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

309
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:15,952
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

310
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:19,662
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

311
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,922
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

312
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:50,572
We represent the Lullaby League

313
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:53,862
The Lullaby League
The Lullaby League

314
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,582
And in the name of the Lullaby League

315
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:02,922
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

316
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:15,342
We represent the Lollipop Guild

317
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:18,812
The Lollipop Guild
The Lollipop Guild

318
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:22,682
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild

319
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:27,652
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

320
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:32,362
We welcome you to Munchkinland

321
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,372
From now on you'll be history

322
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,622
-You'll be his--
-You'll be history

323
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:47,172
And we will glorify your name

324
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,462
-You will be a bust
-Be a bust

325
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:52,802
-Be a bust
-In the hall of fame

326
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,372
l thought you said she was dead.

327
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:26,792
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

328
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,842
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

329
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:34,842
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?

330
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:36,472
Was it you?

331
00:29:37,802 --> 00:29:40,682
lt was an accident.
l didn't mean to kill anybody.

332
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:44,222
Well, my little pretty,
l can cause accidents too!

333
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:47,942
-Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
-The slippers. Yes!

334
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:49,942
The slippers!

335
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:58,612
They're gone!

336
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:01,282
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?

337
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:03,292
Give them back to me or l'll--

338
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:06,832
lt's too late! There they are,
and there they'll stay!

339
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:14,422
Give me back my slippers!
Only l know how to use them.

340
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:18,382
They're of no use to you. Give them
back to me. Give them back!

341
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:19,642
Keep inside of them.

342
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:23,182
Their magic must be powerful
or she wouldn't want them so badly.

343
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,892
Stay out of this, Glinda,
or l'll fix you as well!

344
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:28,312
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.

345
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:31,612
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you too.

346
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:34,692
Very well. l'll bide my time.

347
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:39,912
And as for you, it's true l can't
attend to you here and now as l'd like.

348
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:42,372
But just try to stay out of my way!

349
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:43,582
Just try!

350
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:45,742
l'll get you, my pretty...

351
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:47,752
...and your little dog too!

352
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:01,302
lt's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!

353
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,182
lt's all right.

354
00:31:03,722 --> 00:31:05,102
You can all get up.

355
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:07,722
What a smell of sulfur!

356
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,982
l'm afraid you've made an enemy
of the Wicked Witch.

357
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:15,362
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

358
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:18,862
Oh, l'd give anything
to get out of Oz altogether.

359
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:22,992
But which is the way back to Kansas?
l can't go the way l came.

360
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:26,082
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...

361
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:29,832
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.

362
00:31:30,082 --> 00:31:33,172
The Wizard of Oz?
ls he good or is he wicked?

363
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:35,882
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.

364
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,962
He lives in the Emerald City,
a long journey from here.

365
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,682
Did you bring your broomstick with you?

366
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:43,762
No, l'm afraid l didn't.

367
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:45,682
Well, then, you'll have to walk.

368
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:49,182
The Munchkins will see you
to the border of Munchkinland.

369
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:53,902
And remember, never let those ruby
slippers off your feet for a moment...

370
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:57,732
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

371
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:01,072
But how do l start for Emerald City?

372
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:03,362
lt's always best
to start at the beginning.

373
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:07,242
And all you do is
follow the Yellow Brick Road.

374
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:21,302
-But what happens if l--
-Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

375
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:23,882
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

376
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:38,942
My!

377
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:42,362
People come and go so quickly here!

378
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,782
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

379
00:32:49,332 --> 00:32:51,542
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

380
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:54,792
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

381
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:57,962
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

382
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:00,172
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

383
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:02,092
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

384
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:05,512
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

385
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:09,052
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

386
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:14,272
Follow the Yellow Brick

387
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,192
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

388
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:23,032
You're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

389
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:26,572
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

390
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:30,032
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

391
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:32,912
Because, because, because
Because, because

392
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:35,912
Because of the wonderful things he does

393
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:41,302
You're Off to See the Wizard
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz

394
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:01,152
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

395
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,482
Follow the Yellow...?

396
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:06,362
Now which way do we go?

397
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,532
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.

398
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:13,792
Who said that?

399
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,632
Don't be silly, Toto.
Scarecrows don't talk.

400
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:23,302
lt's pleasant down that way too.

401
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:28,432
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

402
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:31,472
Of course, people do go both ways.

403
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:38,522
Why, you did say something, didn't you?

404
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:46,152
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

405
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:49,362
That's the trouble.
l can't make up my mind.

406
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:51,282
l haven't got a brain.

407
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:53,032
Only straw.

408
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:56,252
How can you talk if you
haven't got a brain?

409
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:57,962
l don't know.

410
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:01,922
But some people without brains
do a lot of talking, don't they?

411
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:04,462
Yes, l guess you're right.

412
00:35:05,632 --> 00:35:09,052
Well, we haven't really
met properly, have we?

413
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:11,182
Why, no.

414
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:12,342
How do you do?

415
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:14,012
How do you do?

416
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:17,522
-Very well, thank you.
-l'm not feeling at all well.

417
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:22,562
lt's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

418
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:26,902
Oh, dear. That must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

419
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,612
Down? No, you see, l'm--
Well, l'm--

420
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:31,862
Well, here. Let me help you.

421
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:35,082
That's very kind of you.
Very kind.

422
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,332
Oh, dear. l don't see....

423
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:42,212
Of course, l'm not bright
about doing things...

424
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:46,712
...but if you'll just bend
the nail down, maybe l'll slip off and--

425
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,302
Oh, yes!

426
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,552
There goes some of me again!

427
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:54,012
Does it hurt you?

428
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:57,762
l just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

429
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,272
My! lt's good to be free!

430
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:03,482
Did l scare you?

431
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,942
l just thought you hurt yourself.

432
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:08,322
l didn't scare you?

433
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,282
No, of course not.

434
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:12,072
l didn't think so.

435
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,702
Boo! Scat! Boo!

436
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:21,412
You see?
l can't even scare a crow.

437
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:25,832
They come from miles around just to eat
in my field and laugh in my face.

438
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:29,502
Oh, l'm a failure, because
l haven't got a brain!

439
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:32,802
What would you do
with a brain if you had one?

440
00:36:33,012 --> 00:36:35,642
Do? Why, if l had a brain, l could--

441
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:40,022
I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers

442
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,432
Consulting with the rain

443
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:47,192
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'

444
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:49,572
If I Only Had a Brain

445
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:55,032
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le

446
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:57,122
In trouble or in pain

447
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:02,252
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln

448
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:04,752
If you only had a brain

449
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:09,422
Oh, I could tell you why

450
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:13,222
The ocean's near the shore

451
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:16,892
I could think of things
I never thunk before

452
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:20,432
And then I'd sit
And think some more

453
00:37:21,222 --> 00:37:24,982
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'

454
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,562
My heart all full of pain

455
00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:32,232
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry

456
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,492
If I Only Had a Brain

457
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,532
Wonderful!

458
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:42,872
lf our scarecrow back in Kansas
could do that...

459
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:46,082
-...the crows would be scared to pieces!
-They would?

460
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:48,542
-Where's Kansas?
-That's where l live.

461
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,632
l want to get back there so badly,
l'm going to Emerald City...

462
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:53,922
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

463
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,092
You're going to see a wizard?

464
00:37:57,132 --> 00:38:00,432
Do you think if l went,
this wizard would give me brains?

465
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:01,972
l couldn't say.

466
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:06,232
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

467
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:09,352
-Yes, that's true.
-But maybe you better not.

468
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,902
l've got a witch mad at me,
and you might get into trouble.

469
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,072
Witch?

470
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:16,862
l'm not afraid of a witch!
l'm not afraid of anything!

471
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:20,322
Except a lighted match.

472
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:21,872
l don't blame you.

473
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:25,952
But l'd face a whole box of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

474
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:30,752
l won't be any trouble,
because l don't eat a thing.

475
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:34,302
And l won't try to manage things,
because l can't think.

476
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:36,422
Won't you take me with you?

477
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:38,842
Of course l will!

478
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:42,512
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

479
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:47,312
-You're not starting out very well.
-l'll try! Really, l will!

480
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:48,852
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

481
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:53,362
We're Off to See the Wizard
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz

482
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,942
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

483
00:38:57,192 --> 00:39:00,572
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

484
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,832
Because, because, because
Because, because

485
00:39:04,372 --> 00:39:06,662
Because of the wonderful things he does

486
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:11,882
We're Off to See the Wizard
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz

487
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,432
Apples!

488
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,312
Oh, look!

489
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:41,912
What do you think you're doing?

490
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:47,372
We've been walking a long ways
and l was hungry and--

491
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:49,252
Did you say something?

492
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,372
-She was hungry!
-She was hungry!

493
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,542
How would like to have someone come
along and pick something off of you?

494
00:39:55,922 --> 00:39:57,002
Oh, dear!

495
00:39:57,252 --> 00:40:00,132
l keep forgetting l'm not in Kansas.

496
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:01,842
Come along, Dorothy.

497
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:04,262
You don't want any of those apples.

498
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:06,512
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they ought to be?

499
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:10,432
Oh, no! lt's just that she doesn't
like little green worms!

500
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:11,852
Oh, you!

501
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:18,902
l'll show you how to get apples.

502
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,032
Hooray! l guess that did it!

503
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,372
Help yourself.

504
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,602
Why, it's a man!

505
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,192
A man made out of tin!

506
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:00,982
Yes...!

507
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:03,782
Look!

508
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:09,952
Did you say something?

509
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:13,832
He said "oilcan."

510
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:15,502
Oil can what?

511
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:17,082
Oilcan?

512
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:21,002
Here it is.

513
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,302
Where do you want to be oiled first?

514
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,052
He said his mouth.

515
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,222
The other side.

516
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:46,242
My goodness! l can talk again!

517
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:49,122
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.

518
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:51,292
Here.

519
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:56,082
Did that hurt?

520
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:58,752
No, it feels wonderful.

521
00:41:58,962 --> 00:42:01,252
l've held that axe up for ages.

522
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:02,592
Goodness!

523
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:05,262
How did you ever get like this?

524
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:08,682
About a year ago...

525
00:42:08,932 --> 00:42:10,602
...l was chopping that tree...

526
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:12,932
...when suddenly it began to rain.

527
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:16,732
And right in the middle of a chop,
l rusted solid.

528
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:19,812
And l've been that way ever since.

529
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:24,442
You're perfect now.

530
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,532
My neck. My neck.

531
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:28,112
Perfect?

532
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,952
Bang on my chest
if you think l'm perfect.

533
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,372
Go ahead, bang on it!

534
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:36,542
Beautiful!

535
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,212
What an echo!

536
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:39,712
lt's empty.

537
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:44,212
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

538
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:46,512
No heart?

539
00:42:46,762 --> 00:42:47,882
No heart.

540
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,802
All hollow.

541
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:59,272
When a man's an empty kettle
He should be on his mettle

542
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:02,232
And yet I'm torn apart

543
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:08,402
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human

544
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:11,282
If I Only Had a Heart

545
00:43:12,872 --> 00:43:17,412
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental

546
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,292
Regarding love and art

547
00:43:21,962 --> 00:43:26,552
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows

548
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:30,012
If I Only Had a Heart

549
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:35,062
Picture me
A balcony

550
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:39,562
Above, a voice sings low

551
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,812
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

552
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:46,072
I hear a beat

553
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:49,112
How sweet!

554
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:54,122
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion

555
00:43:54,372 --> 00:43:56,662
And really feel the part

556
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:03,632
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper

557
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:07,672
If I Only Had a Heart

558
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:34,192
-Are you all right?
-l'm a little rusty yet.

559
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:35,482
Oh, dear!

560
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,152
That was wonderful!

561
00:45:39,032 --> 00:45:40,612
You know...

562
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:44,202
...we were wondering why
you couldn't come with us...

563
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:46,282
...to ask the Wizard for a heart.

564
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:49,412
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there.

565
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:51,082
Oh, but he will!

566
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:52,662
He must!

567
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:55,332
We've come such a long way already.

568
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,262
You call that long?

569
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,472
Why, you've just begun!

570
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,142
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

571
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:11,522
Well, stay away from her...

572
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,852
...or l'll stuff a mattress with you!

573
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,272
And you!

574
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:19,152
l'll use you for a beehive!

575
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,072
Here, scarecrow! Want to play ball?

576
00:46:26,622 --> 00:46:29,202
Fire!
l'm burning! l'm burning!

577
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:43,552
l'm not afraid of her.

578
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:47,392
l'll see you get safely to the Wizard,
whether l get a brain or not!

579
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:49,722
Stuff a mattress with me!

580
00:46:50,972 --> 00:46:53,892
l'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether l get a heart or not.

581
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:55,772
Beehive! Bah!

582
00:46:56,152 --> 00:46:59,482
Let her try and make
a beehive out of me!

583
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:04,532
You're the best friends
anybody ever had.

584
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:09,202
And it's funny, but l feel as if
l've known you all the time.

585
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,542
-But l couldn't have, could l?
-l don't see how.

586
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:15,962
You weren't around when l was
stuffed and sewn together.

587
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:19,882
And l was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

588
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,882
Still, l wish l could remember.

589
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,422
But l guess it doesn't matter anyway.

590
00:47:25,632 --> 00:47:27,472
We know each other now.

591
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:29,682
-That's right.
-We do.

592
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:31,602
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

593
00:47:31,812 --> 00:47:35,562
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

594
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:39,102
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

595
00:47:39,352 --> 00:47:42,572
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

596
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:46,152
Because, because, because
Because, because

597
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:48,862
Because of the wonderful things he does

598
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:53,742
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

599
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,982
l don't like this forest.

600
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:23,862
lt's dark and creepy!

1
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,590
Of course, l don't know...

2
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,260
...but l think it'll get darker
before it gets lighter.

3
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,640
Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

4
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,810
We might.

5
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,890
Animals that eat straw?

6
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,730
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

7
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,320
-Lions!
-And tigers?

8
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,780
And bears!

9
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,150
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

10
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,070
Lions and tigers and bears!

11
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,200
Oh, my!

12
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,990
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

13
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,290
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

14
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,360
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

15
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,320
Which one of you first?

16
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,910
l'll fight you both together,
if you want.

17
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,240
l'll fight you with
one paw tied behind my back!

18
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,580
l'll fight you on one foot!

19
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,250
l'll fight you with my eyes closed!

20
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,540
Pulling an ax on me, eh?

21
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,420
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why....

22
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,680
-Go away and let us alone.
-Oh, scared, huh?

23
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,300
Afraid, huh?

24
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,770
How long can you stay fresh
in that can?

25
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,650
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard.

26
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,150
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

27
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,980
That's getting personal, Lion.

28
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,990
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

29
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,620
What's wrong with you teaching him?

30
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,740
Well, l hardly know him.

31
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,580
l'll get you anyway, peewee!

32
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,470
Shame on you!

33
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,510
What did you do that for?
l didn't bite him.

34
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,510
No, but you tried to.

35
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,560
lt's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but picking on little dogs....

36
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:48,110
Well, you didn't have to go
and hit me, did you?

37
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,690
ls my nose bleeding?

38
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,650
Well, of course not.

39
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,110
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!

40
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,580
Naturally, when you go around picking
on things weaker than you are....

41
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,580
You're nothing but a big coward!

42
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,080
You're right, l am a coward!

43
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,500
l haven't any courage at all.

44
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,340
l even scare myself!

45
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,420
Look at the circles under my eyes.

46
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,510
l haven't slept in weeks.

47
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Why don't you try counting sheep?

48
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,180
That doesn't do any good.
l'm afraid of them.

49
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,270
Oh, that's too bad.

50
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,400
You think the Wizard
could help him too?

51
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,440
l don't see why not.

52
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,360
Come along with us.

53
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,400
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.

54
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,610
-And him a brain.
-He could give you some courage.

55
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,370
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

56
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,960
l would.

57
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,420
No, of course not.

58
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,380
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

59
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,050
My life has been simply unbearable.

60
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,680
Well, it's all right now.

61
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,470
The Wizard'll fix everything.

62
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,140
lt's been in me so long.

63
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,440
l just gotta tell you how l feel.

64
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,190
Come on!

65
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,480
Yeah, it's sad, believe me, missy
When you're born to be a sissy

66
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,940
Without the vim and verve

67
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,370
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse

68
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,040
If I Only Had the Nerve

69
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,500
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion

70
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,090
A fate I don't deserve

71
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,050
-I'd be brave as a blizzard
-I'd be gentle as a lizard

72
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,130
I'd be clever as a gizzard

73
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,760
If the Wizard is a wizard
who will serve

74
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,640
Then I'm sure to get a brain

75
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,730
-A heart
-A home

76
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,350
The nerve!

77
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,820
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

78
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,450
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

79
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,870
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

80
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,950
Because, because, because
Because, because

81
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,750
Because of the wonderful things he does

82
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,880
We're Off to See the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

83
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,180
So you won't take warning, eh?

84
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,270
All the worse for you, then!

85
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,440
l'll take care of you now
instead of later!

86
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,230
When l gain those ruby slippers...

87
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,070
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!

88
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,990
And now, my beauties...

89
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,240
...something with poison in it, l think.

90
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,580
With poison in it.

91
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,580
But attractive to the eye
and soothing to the smell!

92
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,630
Poppies.

93
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,760
Poppies!

94
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,220
Poppies will put them to sleep.

95
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,390
Sleep....

96
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,720
Now they'll sleep.

97
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,460
There's Emerald City!

98
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,090
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!

99
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,430
lt's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like l knew it would be.

100
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,850
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that!

101
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,810
What are we waiting for?

102
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,810
-Nothing! Let's hurry!
-Yes, let's run!

103
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,820
Come on! Come on!

104
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,070
Hurry! Hurry!

105
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,450
Go! Look!

106
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,370
Come on!

107
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,710
Look at the scenery. lt's wonderful!

108
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,290
Emerald City!

109
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,380
What's happening?

110
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,050
What is it?

111
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,430
l can't run anymore.
l'm so sleepy.

112
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,180
Give us your hands.
We'll pull you.

113
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:33,640
Oh, no, please.

114
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,930
l have to rest for just a minute.

115
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,270
Toto. Where's Toto?

116
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,150
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

117
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,820
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!

118
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:49,870
Coming to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

119
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,830
Don't you start it too!

120
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,660
We ought to carry Dorothy!

121
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,000
l don't think l could,
but we could try.

122
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,460
Now look at him!
lt's terrible!

123
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,750
Here, Tin Man, help me.

124
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,010
This is terrible!

125
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,590
l can't budge her an inch!
This is a spell, this is!

126
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,640
lt's the Wicked Witch!
What'll we do?

127
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,180
Help! Help!

128
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,560
lt's no use screaming
at a time like this.

129
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,770
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!

130
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,730
Help!

131
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,070
lt's snowing!

132
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,240
No, it isn't!

133
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,990
Yes, it is!

134
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,700
Maybe that'll help!

135
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,830
Oh, but it couldn't help!

136
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,710
lt does help!

137
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,500
Dorothy, you're waking up!

138
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,930
Unusual weather we're having,
ain't it?

139
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,020
Look. He's rusted again!

140
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:02,440
-Give me the oilcan, quick!
-Here.

141
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,730
-He is rusted.
-Here.

142
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,820
-Here.
-Quick!

143
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,320
Curses! Curses!

144
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,950
Somebody always helps that girl!

145
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,910
But shoes or no shoes,
l'm still great enough to conquer her.

146
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,660
And woe to those who try to stop me!

147
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,080
Let's get out of here.

148
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,040
Look! Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever!

149
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,090
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark

150
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,170
You're out of the night

151
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,010
Step into the sun
Step into the light

152
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,510
Keep straight ahead for
the most glorious place

153
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,180
On the face of the earth
or the sky

154
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,190
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart

155
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,110
Hold on to your hope

156
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,230
March up to the gate
And bid it open

157
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,330
To the Emerald City,
as fast as lightning!

158
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,090
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark

159
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,920
You're out of the night

160
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,260
Step into the sun
Step into the light

161
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,010
March up to the gate
And bid it...

162
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,390
...open

163
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,480
Open

164
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:29,440
Who rang that bell?

165
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,690
-We did!
-Can't you read?

166
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,110
-Read what?
-The notice!

167
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,280
-What notice?
-lt's on the door!

168
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,080
As plain as the nose on my face!

169
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:49,960
"Bell out of order.

170
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,760
Please knock."

171
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:56,340
Well! That's more like it!

172
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,390
Now, state your business.

173
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,430
We want to see the Wizard!

174
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,850
The Wizard?

175
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,730
But nobody can see the Great Oz!

176
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,020
Nobody's ever seen the Great Oz!

177
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:11,110
Even l've never seen him!

178
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,690
Well, then, how do you know
there is one?

179
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,820
Because he's--

180
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,530
You're wasting my time!

181
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,870
Oh, please. Please, sir.

182
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,960
l've got to see the Wizard.
The Good Witch of the North sent me.

183
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,330
Prove it!

184
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,920
She's wearing the ruby slippers
that she gave her.

185
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,340
So she is!

186
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:39,050
Well, bust my buttons!

187
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,600
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

188
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,100
That's a horse of a different color!

189
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,850
Come on in!

190
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,320
Cabby! Cabby!

191
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:03,290
Just what you're looking for!
Take you any place in the city, we does!

192
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,460
-Would you take us to see the Wizard?
-The Wizard? The Wizard?

193
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,130
Yes, of course. But first l'll
take you to a place...

194
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,840
...where you can tidy up.

195
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:17,220
Oh, thank you so much!

196
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,640
We've been gone such a long time,
and we feel so mess--

197
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,510
What kind of a horse is that?

198
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,730
-l've never seen a horse like that!
-No, and never will again.

199
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,770
There's only one of him, and he's it.

200
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,730
He's the Horse of a Different Color
you've heard tell about.

201
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,820
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

202
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,740
And a couple of tra-la-las

203
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,280
That's how we laugh the day away
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

204
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,080
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

205
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,160
And a couple of la-di-das

206
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:51,000
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

207
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,840
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one

208
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,720
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done

209
01:00:58,970 --> 01:00:59,800
Jolly good fun!

210
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,470
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

211
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,720
And a couple of tra-la-las

212
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,930
That's how we laugh the day away
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

213
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,100
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

214
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,900
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

215
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,270
That's how we laugh the day away
With a--

216
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,530
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

217
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,450
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there

218
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,490
And a couple of brand-new straws

219
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,910
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

220
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there

221
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,870
Whether you're tin or bronze

222
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,840
That's how we keep you in repair
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

223
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,710
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown

224
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,630
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?

225
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:43,760
Jolly old town!

226
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,680
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there

227
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,810
We give the roughest claws

228
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,940
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

229
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,940
That's how we laugh the day away
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

230
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,160
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha

231
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,080
In the Merry Old Land of Oz

232
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:29,930
Who's her? Who's her?

233
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,350
lt's the witch!

234
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,980
She's followed us here!

235
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,400
"Surrender, Dorothy."

236
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,520
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

237
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,530
-The Wizard will explain it!
-To the Wizard!

238
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,030
Oh, dear!
Whatever shall we do?

239
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,950
We better hurry if we're
gonna see the Wizard!

240
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:52,160
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.

241
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,120
Stop that now, just--

242
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,880
lt's all right!
Everything is all right!

243
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:01,550
The Great and Powerful Oz has got
matters well in hand.

244
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,960
l hope.

245
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:06,430
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!

246
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,100
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.

247
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,970
Go home.

248
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,140
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.

249
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,860
Orders are, nobody can see the Great Oz!
Not nobody, not nohow!

250
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,690
But, please! lt's very important.

251
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,150
l got a permanent
just for the occasion.

252
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,740
Not nobody, not nohow!

253
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,370
But she's Dorothy!

254
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,450
The witch's Dorothy?

255
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,080
Well, that makes a difference.

256
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:41,840
Just wait here.
l'll announce you at once.

257
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:48,050
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.

258
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,430
-l've as good as got my brain.
-l can fairly hear my heart beating.

259
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,060
l'll be home for supper.

260
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,810
ln another hour,
l'll be king of the forest.

261
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,400
Long live the king!

262
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,870
If I Were King of the Forest

263
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:13,120
Not queen

264
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:14,750
Not duke

265
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,040
Not prince

266
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,590
My regal robes of the forest

267
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,550
Would be satin

268
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,210
Not cotton

269
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,720
Not chintz

270
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:32,180
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl

271
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,640
With a woof!

272
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:35,220
And a woof!

273
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:38,850
And a royal growl

274
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,940
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel

275
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:47,240
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow

276
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,780
And the sparrow would take wing

277
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,120
If I

278
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:02,330
If I were king

279
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,710
Each rabbit would show respect to me

280
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,340
The chipmunks genuflect to me

281
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:13,260
Though my tail would lash

282
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,260
I would show compash

283
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,520
For every underling

284
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,520
If I

285
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,900
If I were king

286
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,200
Just king

287
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:07,320
Monarch of all I survey

288
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,360
Monarch

289
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:18,660
Of all I survey

290
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,080
lf you were king,
you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

291
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,380
Not nobody, not nohow!

292
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,920
-Not even a rhinoceros?
-lmposserous!

293
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:34,090
-How about a hippopotamus?
-l'd trash him from top to "bottom-us."

294
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,390
-Supposing you met an elephant?
-l'd wrap him up in "cello-phant" !

295
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,180
-What if it were a brontosaurus?
-l'd show him who's king of the forest!

296
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,890
-How?
-How?

297
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,520
Courage!

298
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,610
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!

299
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,110
What makes the flag on the mast to wave?
Courage!

300
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,200
What makes the elephant
charge his tusk...

301
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:58,490
...in the misty mist
or the dusky dusk?

302
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:03,870
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?
Courage!

303
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,130
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder? Courage!

304
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:10,750
What makes the dawn come up
like thunder?

305
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,920
Courage!

306
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,090
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

307
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,430
What puts the "ape" in apricot?

308
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,970
What have they got that l ain't got?

309
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:22,020
-Courage!
-You can say that again.

310
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,400
The Wizard says go away!

311
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,410
Go away?

312
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:40,780
Looks like we came a long way
for nothing.

313
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,660
And l was so happy.

314
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,870
l thought l was on my way home.

315
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,750
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.

316
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:52,050
We certainly are.

317
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,800
Auntie Em was so good to me...

318
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:57,260
...and l never appreciated it.

319
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,390
Running away and hurting her feelings.

320
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,720
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

321
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,140
She may be dying...

322
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,190
...and it's all my fault.

323
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,070
l'll never forgive myself.

324
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,110
Never, never, never.

325
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,330
Please don't cry anymore.

326
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:26,710
l'll get you into the Wizard somehow.

327
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,670
Come on.
l had an Aunt Em myself once.

328
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,770
Wait a minute, fellas.

329
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,820
l was just thinking, l don't want
to see the Wizard this much.

330
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,990
l better wait for you outside.

331
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,950
-What's the matter?
-He's just scared again.

332
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,660
Don't you know the Wizard will
give you courage?

333
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:08,080
l'd be too scared to ask him for it.

334
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:10,500
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.

335
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,790
l'd sooner wait outside.

336
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,750
Why? Why?

337
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,800
Because l'm still scared!

338
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,510
-What happened?
-Somebody pulled my tail.

339
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,560
You did it yourself.

340
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,430
Here.

341
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,310
Come on.

342
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:37,230
Come forward!

343
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,530
Tell me when it's over!

344
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,790
Look at that. Look at that!

345
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,300
l wanna go home!

346
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:02,630
l am Oz...

347
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,550
...the Great and Powerful!

348
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,470
Who are you?

349
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,020
Who are you?

350
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,860
lf you please...

351
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,110
...l am Dorothy...

352
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:23,240
...the small and meek.

353
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,990
We've come to ask you--

354
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,160
Silence!

355
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,700
Oh! Jiminy crickets!

356
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:33,710
The Great and Powerful Oz...

357
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,790
...knows why you have come.

358
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,050
Step forward...

359
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,670
...Tin Man!

360
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,600
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

361
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,730
You clinking, clanking, clattering...

362
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,610
...collection of caliginous junk!

363
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,610
Yes, sir.

364
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,610
Yes, Your Honor.

365
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,160
You see...

366
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,910
...a while back, we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road--

367
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,410
Quiet!

368
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,170
And you, Scarecrow...

369
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:18,630
...have the effrontery
to ask for a brain...

370
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,510
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!

371
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,720
Yes, Your Honor.
l mean, Your Excellency.

372
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,220
l mean, Your Wizardry!

373
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,010
Enough!

374
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,060
And you, Lion!

375
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,980
Well?

376
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,450
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...

377
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,620
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

378
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:54,750
Silence...

379
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,420
...whippersnapper!

380
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:01,210
The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests.

381
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,380
What's that? What'd he say?

382
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,590
What'd he say?

383
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,220
But first, you must prove
yourselves worthy...

384
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:13,180
...by performing a very small task.

385
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,890
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

386
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,110
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it.

387
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,780
Bring me her broomstick...

388
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,900
...and l'll grant your requests.

389
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,410
Now go!

390
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,160
But what if she kills us first?

391
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,660
l said go!

392
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:23,840
"l'd turn back if l were you."

393
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,410
l believe there's spooks around here.

394
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:57,830
That's ridiculous!

395
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,910
Spooks! That's silly.

396
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,460
Don't you believe in spooks?

397
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,500
No. Why, only--

398
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:15,600
Are you all right?

399
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,680
l do believe in spooks.

400
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:19,730
l do, l do, l do, l do.

401
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,980
l do believe in spooks.
l do, l do, l do, l do, l do!

402
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:29,530
You'll believe in more than that
before l'm finished with you.

403
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:34,570
Take your army and bring me
that girl and her dog.

404
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,120
Do what you like with the others,
but l want her alive.

405
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,790
They'll give you no trouble.
l promise you that.

406
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,710
l've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

407
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:49,590
Take special care of those slippers.
l want those most of all.

408
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,550
Now, fly! Fly!

409
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,380
Bring me that girl and her slippers!

410
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:27,750
Help! Help!

411
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,090
Go away now!

412
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:34,720
Toto! Toto! Help!

413
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,820
Help! Help! Help!

414
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:54,950
What happened to you?

415
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,530
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

416
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:00,280
Then they took my chest
and threw it over there!

417
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,950
That's you all over.

418
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,870
They sure knocked
the stuffings out of you.

419
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,540
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!

420
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:09,040
Now, let's see....

421
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,050
What a nice little dog.

422
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,470
And you, my dear.

423
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,470
What an unexpected pleasure.

424
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,730
lt's so kind of you to visit me
in my loneliness.

425
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,360
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back!

426
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,940
All in good time, my little pretty.

427
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,900
All in good time.

428
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:37,990
Please give me back my dog.

429
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,490
Certainly, certainly...

430
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,620
...when you give me those slippers.

431
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,910
But the Good Witch told me not to.

432
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,830
Very well.

433
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,880
Throw that basket in the river.

434
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:54,250
No! You can have your old slippers,
but give me back Toto!

435
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,210
That's a good little girl.

436
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,840
l knew you'd see reason!

437
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:05,520
l'm sorry! l didn't do it.
Can l still have my dog?

438
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:09,690
No! Fool that l am,
l should have remembered...

439
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:12,480
...those slippers will
never come off...

440
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:16,490
...as long as you're alive.

441
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:20,570
But that's not what's worrying me.
lt's how to do it.

442
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,280
These things must be done delicately...

443
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,660
...or you hurt the spell.

444
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:29,290
-Run, Toto, run!
-Catch him, you fool!

445
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,970
Run, Toto, run!

446
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,600
He got away! He got away!

447
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,350
Which is more than you will!

448
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,020
Drat, you and your dog!

449
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:54,860
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth.

450
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,860
But it'll soon be over now!

451
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,990
Do you see that?

452
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,700
That's how much longer
you've got to be alive.

453
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:06,950
And it isn't long, my pretty.
lt isn't long!

454
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,750
l can't wait forever
to get those shoes!

455
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,730
l'm frightened.

456
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,480
l'm frightened, Auntie Em!
l'm frightened.

457
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:44,570
Where are you?

458
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,910
lt's me. lt's Auntie Em.

459
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,250
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?

460
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
l'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

461
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:55,000
l'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

462
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:58,130
...and l'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

463
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,880
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

464
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,720
l'm frightened!

465
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,430
Come back! Come back!

466
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,640
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"

467
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:11,270
l'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

468
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,840
Look! There's Toto!

469
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,880
Where'd he come from?

470
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,590
Why, don't you see?

471
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,720
He's come to take us to Dorothy.

472
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:49,220
Come on, fellas!

473
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,870
l hope my strength holds out.

474
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,580
l hope your tail holds out.

475
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,340
What's that?

476
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,260
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!

477
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:33,140
-Dorothy's in that awful place?
-l hate to think of her in there.

478
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:36,060
-We've got to get her out.
-Don't cry now.

479
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:39,520
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've
been squeaking enough as it is.

480
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,770
Who's them? Who's them?

481
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,920
-l've got a plan how to get in there.
-Fine. He's got a plan.

482
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:02,960
-And you're gonna lead us.
-Yeah.

483
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:05,340
-Me?
-Yes, you.

484
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:09,090
-l gotta get her out of there?
-That's right.

485
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,850
All right, l'll go in there
for Dorothy.

486
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,930
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

487
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,690
...guards or no guards,
l'll tear them apart.

488
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:23,070
l may not come out alive,
but l'm going in there.

489
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,030
-There's only one thing l want you to do.
-What's that?

490
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,320
Talk me out of it.

491
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,570
-No, you don't!
-Oh, no.

492
01:21:32,820 --> 01:21:34,450
-Now, wait a minute.
-Up!

493
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,680
Come on, l've got another idea.

494
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:40,430
Do you think it would be polite,
dropping in like this?

495
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,090
Where do we go now?

496
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,180
There!

497
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,860
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

498
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:33,900
lt's us!

499
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,110
Yes!

500
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,080
lt's me! She's locked me in!

501
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,660
We gotta get her out! Open the door!

502
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:42,870
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!

503
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,830
The hourglass is almost empty!

504
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,540
Stand back!

505
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:07,440
l knew you'd come!
l knew you would!

506
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:10,110
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

507
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:23,500
Going so soon?

508
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,540
l wouldn't hear of it.

509
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:29,630
Why, my little party's just beginning.

510
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,590
Trapped.
Trapped like mice...rats!

511
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,890
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.

512
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:47,640
We'll let them think about it
a little first.

513
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,910
Seize them! Seize them!

514
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,910
Stop them, you fools!

515
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,990
Seize them! Seize them!

516
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,210
There they go! Now we've got them!

517
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,550
Half you go this way,
half you go that way.

518
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,880
Hurry! Hurry!

519
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:28,730
Where do we go now?

520
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,060
This way. Come on!

521
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,490
Back! Back!

522
01:25:58,170 --> 01:25:59,590
Well!

523
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,760
Ring-around the rosie,
a pocket full of spears!

524
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:05,560
Thought you'd be pretty foxy,
didn't you?

525
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,890
The last to go will see
the first three go before her.

526
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,110
And her mangy little dog too!

527
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,780
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

528
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,450
Help! l'm burning! l'm burning!
lt's burning!

529
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:31,000
Don't touch that water!

530
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,880
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!

531
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,010
l'm melting! Melting!

532
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,300
What a world! What a world!

533
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:44,260
Who would've thought
a good little girl like you...

534
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,930
...could destroy
my beautiful wickedness?

535
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,680
Look out! Look out!

536
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:51,730
l'm going.

537
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,870
She's dead. You've killed her.

538
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,660
l didn't mean to kill her.

539
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,420
Really, l didn't.

540
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,210
lt's just that he was on fire.

541
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,840
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

542
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:20,840
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!

543
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:23,010
The Wicked Witch is dead!

544
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,260
The broom.

545
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:27,430
-May we have it?
-Please. And take it with you.

546
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,720
Thank you so much!

547
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,600
Now we can go tell the Wizard
the Wicked Witch is dead!

548
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,310
The Wicked Witch is dead!

549
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,980
Can l believe my eyes?

550
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:39,020
Why have you come back?

551
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,280
Please, sir. We've done
what you told us.

552
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:47,740
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch.

553
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,910
We melted her.

554
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,750
You liquidated her, eh?
Very resourceful.

555
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,960
Yes, sir.

556
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:59,540
So we'd like you to keep
your promise to us, if you please.

557
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,050
Not so fast. Not so fast!

558
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:05,800
l'll have to give the matter
a little thought.

559
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:08,930
Go away and come back tomorrow.

560
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,350
Tomorrow?

561
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,270
But l want to go home now!

562
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,190
You've had plenty of time already.

563
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,610
Do not arouse the wrath
of the Great and Powerful Oz!

564
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,780
l said come back tomorrow!

565
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:27,030
lf you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises.

566
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:30,990
Do you presume to criticize
the Great Oz?

567
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,540
You ungrateful creatures!

568
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:37,500
Think yourselves lucky that l'm
giving you audience tomorrow...

569
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,920
...instead of 20 years from now!

570
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,380
The Great Oz has spoken!

571
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,600
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.

572
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:54,020
The Great and--
Oz has spoken.

573
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:55,430
Who are you?

574
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,310
Well, l am the Great and Powerful
Wizard of Oz.

575
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,070
You are?

576
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,650
l don't believe you!

577
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,360
l'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.

578
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:09,870
You humbug!

579
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:13,580
Yes, that's exactly so. l'm a humbug.

580
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,710
You're a very bad man!

581
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,630
No, my dear. l'm a very good man.

582
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,590
l'm just a very bad wizard.

583
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,840
What about the heart
you promised Tin Man?

584
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,970
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?

585
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,010
And Scarecrow's brain?

586
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:34,180
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

587
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:37,310
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

588
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,770
...or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain.

589
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:43,150
Back where l come from,
we have universities...

590
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,820
...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

591
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:51,200
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

592
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:55,160
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

593
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:59,460
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

594
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:03,500
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

595
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,920
...l hereby confer upon you...

596
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:09,630
...the honorary degree of Th.D.

597
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,880
Th.D.?

598
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,430
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

599
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:16,520
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

600
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:19,640
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

601
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,810
Oh, joy! Rapture!

602
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,610
l've got a brain!

603
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,020
How can l thank you enough?

604
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,820
Well, you can't.
As for you, my fine friend...

605
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:31,240
...you're a victim
of disorganized thinking.

606
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:35,120
You are under the delusion
that because you run away from danger...

607
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:39,250
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

608
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,460
Back where l come from,
we have men who are called "heroes."

609
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:46,750
Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

610
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,170
...and parade it down the main street.

611
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:52,300
And they have no more courage
than you have.

612
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:56,760
But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

613
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,220
Therefore...

614
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:02,020
...for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valor...

615
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:05,310
...conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

616
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,610
...l award you the Triple Cross.

617
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:11,490
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage.

618
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,910
Shucks, folks, l'm speechless.

619
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,080
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

620
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,960
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

621
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:30,300
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

622
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,220
But l still want one.

623
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:37,640
Back where l come from, there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

624
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:40,350
They are called phil--

625
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,350
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts
are no bigger than yours.

626
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,110
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A testimonial.

627
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,240
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

628
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,200
...l take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

629
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:58,950
...with a small token
of our esteem and affection.

630
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,910
And remember, my sentimental friend...

631
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,420
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

632
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:08,460
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

633
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,630
lt ticks!

634
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,220
Listen! Look, it ticks!

635
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,470
Read what my medal says. "Courage."

636
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,100
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!

637
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:23,930
Oh, they're all wonderful.

638
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,350
Hey, what about Dorothy?

639
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,310
Yes, how about Dorothy?

640
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:30,480
Dorothy next.

641
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:34,190
l don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

642
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,660
You force me into
a cataclysmic decision.

643
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:40,700
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas
is for me to take her myself.

644
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,790
Oh, will you? Could you?

645
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:48,380
But are you clever enough to manage it?

646
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:50,630
Child, you cut me to the quick!

647
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,710
l'm an old Kansas man myself...

648
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,550
...born and bred
in the western wilderness...

649
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,850
...premier balloonist par excellence to
the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

650
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:04,850
Until one day, while performing
feats of stratospheric skill...

651
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,350
...never before attempted
by civilized man...

652
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,810
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.

653
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,110
The balloon failed
to return to the fair.

654
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,150
lt did?

655
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,320
Weren't you frightened?

656
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:18,160
You are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death...

657
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,950
...sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe. l was petrified.

658
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,830
Suddenly the wind changed...

659
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,290
...and the balloon floated down
into this noble city...

660
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:33,590
...where l was instantly acclaimed Oz,
the first wizard deluxe!

661
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,720
Times being what they were,
l accepted the job...

662
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:41,140
...retaining my balloon
against the advent of a quick getaway.

663
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,430
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...

664
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,600
...you and l will return to
the land of E Pluribus Unum.

665
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,570
My friends. l mean, my friends!

666
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:07,080
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown...

667
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:09,160
...be that as it may.

668
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:13,000
l, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...

669
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,550
...am about to embark
upon a hazardous...

670
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,550
...and technically
unexplainable journey...

671
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,720
...into the outer stratosphere!

672
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,770
To confer, converse...

673
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:30,560
...and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

674
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:34,310
And l hereby decree
that until what time...

675
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,820
...if any, that l return...

676
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:41,700
...the Scarecrow, by virtue
of his highly superior brains...

677
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:43,700
...shall rule in my stead...

678
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:48,450
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

679
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,540
...and the Lion,
by virtue of his courage.

680
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:55,250
Obey them as you would me.

681
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,750
Thank you.

682
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,510
Come back!

683
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,590
Don't go without me.
l'll be right back.

684
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,930
Stop that dog!

685
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:10,730
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!

686
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:12,270
Ruined my exit!

687
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,100
Come back! Come back!

688
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:16,820
Don't go without me!
Please come back!

689
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:20,280
l can't come back!
l don't know how it works!

690
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:21,860
Goodbye, folks!

691
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:23,490
Goodbye!

692
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,160
Now l'll never get home.

693
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,330
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

694
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,210
We all love you.

695
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,920
We don't want you to go.

696
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,380
That's very kind of you...

697
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:43,760
...but this could never be like Kansas.

698
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:47,890
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

699
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,220
Oh, Scarecrow, what am l going to do?

700
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,140
Look!

701
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:56,440
Here's someone who can help you!

702
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,220
Will you help me? Can you help me?

703
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:34,390
You don't need help any longer.

704
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,440
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

705
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:38,610
l have?

706
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,440
Why didn't you tell her before?

707
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:44,650
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

708
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,110
What have you learned, Dorothy?

709
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,290
l think that it...

710
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:56,500
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

711
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:01,290
And it's that if l ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

712
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,880
...l won't look any further
than my own back yard...

713
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,340
...because if it isn't there...

714
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:10,680
...l never really lost it
to begin with.

715
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:11,970
ls that right?

716
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,850
That's all it is.

717
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:17,190
But that's so easy!
l should've thought of it for you.

718
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,940
l should've felt it in my heart.

719
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:21,110
She had to find it out for herself.

720
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,690
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

721
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,570
-Toto too?
-Toto too.

722
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:29,780
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

723
01:37:30,030 --> 01:37:31,160
Oh, dear.

724
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:33,540
That's too wonderful to be true!

725
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:39,880
lt's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

726
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,380
l love you all too.

727
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:46,550
Goodbye, Tin Man.

728
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:49,260
Don't cry.

729
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,180
You'll rust so dreadfully.

730
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:56,140
Here. Here's your oilcan.

731
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:58,690
Goodbye.

732
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,650
Now l know l've got a heart...

733
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,810
...because it's breaking.

734
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:07,650
Goodbye, Lion.

735
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,530
l know it isn't right...

736
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:13,490
...but l'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

737
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,160
...before you found your courage.

738
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:20,330
l would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

739
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,840
l think l'll miss you most of all.

740
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,930
Are you ready now?

741
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,940
Say goodbye, Toto.

742
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:44,520
Yes, l'm ready now.

743
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,320
Then close your eyes...

744
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:49,440
...and tap your heels
together three times...

745
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:53,740
...and think to yourself...

746
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:57,040
..."There's no place like home.

747
01:38:57,290 --> 01:39:00,410
There's no place like home."

748
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:04,130
There's no place like home.

749
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,670
There's no place like home.

750
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:29,990
Wake up, honey.

751
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,620
Dorothy, dear. lt's Aunt Em, darling.

752
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

753
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:50,050
-Yes, darling.
-Hello there! Anybody home?

754
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:54,180
l dropped by because l heard
the little girl got caught in the big--

755
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:56,140
She seems all right now.

756
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:57,930
She got quite a bump.

757
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:00,470
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

758
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:03,390
But l did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

759
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,650
And l tried to get back for days!

760
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,730
There, there, lie quiet now.

761
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:10,980
You just had a bad dream.

762
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:12,740
Remember me...

763
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,070
...your old pal, Hunk?

764
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,780
And me...

765
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,950
...Hickory?

766
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,700
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

767
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,540
But it wasn't a dream.

768
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:23,830
lt was a place.

769
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,710
And you and you and you...

770
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,590
...and you were there.

771
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,920
But you couldn't have been, could you?

772
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,010
We dream lots of silly things
when we--

773
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:38,300
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

774
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:41,350
And l remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

775
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,640
...but most of it was beautiful.

776
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:47,600
But just the same, all l kept saying
to everybody was, "l want to go home!"

777
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:49,820
And they sent me home.

778
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,650
Doesn't anybody believe me?

779
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,860
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

780
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,370
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

781
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,660
Home!

782
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,540
And this is my room...

783
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:03,250
...and you're all here.

784
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,580
And l'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

785
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:09,250
...because l love you all.

786
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:12,420
And oh, Auntie Em...

787
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,510
...there's no place like home!
