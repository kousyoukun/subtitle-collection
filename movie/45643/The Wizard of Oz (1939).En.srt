The Wizard of Oz (1939) - 29.97 fps

1
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,069
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?

2
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:14,008
She tried to, didn't she? Come on.
We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

3
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,085
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

4
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,023
Aunt Em, just listen
to what Miss Gulch did to Toto!

5
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,992
-Dorothy, please! We're trying to count!
-But she hit him--

6
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:35,462
Don't bother us now, honey.
This old incubator's gone bad...

7
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:38,299
...and we're likely to lose
a lot of our chicks.

8
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,668
The poor little things.

9
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:44,371
Miss Gulch hit Toto on the back
with a rake just because she says...

10
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:47,975
...he gets in her garden and chases
her nasty old cat every day!

11
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:49,610
Dorothy, please!

12
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:52,846
But he doesn't do it every day,
just once or twice a week.

13
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:56,850
He can't catch her old cat, anyway!
And now she says she's going to--

14
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,719
Dorothy! We're busy!

15
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:02,623
All right.

16
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:07,294
How's she coming?

17
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,596
Take it easy.

18
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:11,532
You got my finger!

19
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,834
Why don't you get your finger
out of the way?

20
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,336
There you are.

21
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,606
-Right on my finger!
-It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

22
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:20,908
Zeke, what am I going to do
about Miss Gulch?

23
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:25,079
-Just because Toto chases her old cat--
-Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

24
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:27,681
Dorothy, you ain't using your head
about Miss Gulch.

25
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:31,051
-You'd think you didn't have any brains.
-I have so got brains!

26
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,486
Why don't you use them?

27
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:34,755
When you come home
don't go by her place...

28
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:38,826
...then Toto won't get in her garden
and you won't get in no trouble.

29
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,862
Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.

30
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:44,765
Well, your head ain't made of straw,
you know.

31
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,938
Get in there before I make
a dimebank out of you!

32
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:55,142
Listen, kid....

33
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:59,947
Are you going to let that old Gulch heifer
try and buffalo you?

34
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:03,717
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage, that's all.

35
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,152
I'm not afraid of her.

36
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,289
The next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

37
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:09,790
That's what I'd do!

38
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,731
Zeke, get me out of here! Help!

39
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,069
Are you all right, Dorothy?

40
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,737
Yes, I'm all right.

41
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,140
I fell in and Zeke....

42
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,545
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am!

43
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,115
You gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of you?

44
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,617
Look at you, Zeke--

45
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,453
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,690
I know three farm hands
who'll be out of a job before they know it!

47
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:43,991
Dorothy was walking--

48
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:47,628
I saw you tinkering with that contraption.
You two get back to the wagon!

49
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:48,929
All right, Mrs. Gale.

50
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,932
Someday they're going to erect a statue
to me in this town--

51
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,034
Don't start posing for it now.

52
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,572
Here, can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers. Just fried.

53
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,744
-Dorothy toppled into--
-It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!

54
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:07,214
Now, you go feed those hogs
before they worry themselves into anemia!

55
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:11,251
Do you know what Miss Gulch said
she was going to do to Toto?

56
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,455
Now, Dorothy, stop imagining things.

57
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,157
You always get yourself
into a fret over nothing.

58
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:21,295
Help us out today and find a place
where you won't get into any trouble.

59
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:27,234
Some place where there isn't any trouble.

60
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,771
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

61
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,107
There must be.

62
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,612
It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

63
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:42,783
It's far, far away...

64
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:45,953
...behind the moon...

65
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:48,489
...beyond the rain....

66
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:54,628
<i>* Somewhere, over the rainbow... *</i>

67
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,732
<i>* ...way up high *</i>

68
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:05,539
<i>* There's a land that I heard of... *</i>

69
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:09,176
<i>* ...once in a lullaby *</i>

70
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:16,583
<i>* Somewhere, over the rainbow... *</i>

71
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:20,688
<i>* ...skies are blue *</i>

72
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:27,861
<i>* And the dreams that you dare to dream *</i>

73
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:31,465
<i>* Really do come true *</i>

74
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,438
<i>* Someday I'll wish upon a star *</i>

75
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:42,509
<i>* And wake up where the clouds *</i>
<i>* are far behind me *</i>

76
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,482
<i>* Where troubles melt like lemon drops, *</i>

77
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,018
<i>* Away above the chimney tops *</i>

78
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:56,457
<i>* That's where you'll find me *</i>

79
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:06,200
<i>* Somewhere, over the rainbow... *</i>

80
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:10,137
<i>* ...bluebirds fly *</i>

81
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:17,378
<i>* Birds fly over the rainbow *</i>

82
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:23,717
<i>* Why then, oh, why can't I? *</i>

83
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,702
<i>* If happy little bluebirds fly... *</i>

84
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,772
<i>* ...beyond the rainbow *</i>

85
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,444
<i>* Why, oh, why can't I? *</i>

86
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,705
Mr. Gale.

87
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,540
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

88
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:23,477
I want to see you and your wife
right away about Dorothy.

89
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,112
What has Dorothy done?

90
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,382
What's she done? I'm all but lame
from the bite on my leg!

91
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,951
-You mean, she bit you?
-No, her dog!

92
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,488
She bit her dog, eh?

93
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:36,323
No!

94
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,093
That dog's a menace.

95
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,829
I'll take him to the Sheriff
and make sure he's destroyed.

96
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,664
Destroyed? Toto?

97
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,066
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

98
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:50,037
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

99
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:52,673
Of course, we won't. Will we, Em?

100
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:55,409
Please, Aunt Em! Toto didn't mean to.

101
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:58,912
He didn't know he was doing
anything wrong. I ought to be punished.

102
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:02,116
I let him go in her garden.
You can send me to bed without supper.

103
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:05,286
Hand over the dog, or I'll bring
a damage suit and take your farm!

104
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:07,755
There's a law protecting folks
from dogs that bite!

105
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,456
What if she keeps him tied up?

106
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,759
He's really gentle,
with gentle people, that is.

107
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:16,430
Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
Here's his order allowing me to take him.

108
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:19,233
Unless you want to go against the law.

109
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,503
Yes....

110
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,273
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.

111
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,841
Now you're seeing reason.

112
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:31,145
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

113
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:33,347
No, no! I won't let you take him!

114
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:35,649
You go away! I'll bite you myself!

115
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:36,817
Dorothy!

116
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,519
You wicked old witch!

117
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,021
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em,
don't let them take Toto!

118
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:43,724
Don't let her take him, please! Stop her.

119
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:46,794
-Put him in the basket, Henry.
-The idea!

120
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,329
Don't, Uncle Henry.

121
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:51,498
Oh, Toto!

122
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,279
Almira Gulch, just because you own
half the county...

123
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:08,148
...doesn't mean you have the power
to run the rest of us!

124
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:11,452
For 23 years I've been dying to tell you
what I thought of you!

125
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,990
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!

126
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,985
Toto, darling! Oh, I've got you back!

127
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:46,654
You came back!

128
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:49,290
Oh, I'm so glad!

129
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,230
They'll be coming back for you in a minute.

130
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:00,567
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!

131
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:39,573
Well, well, well! Houseguests, huh?

132
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,575
And who might you be?

133
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,811
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

134
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:46,513
Let's see. You're....

135
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,883
You're travelling in disguise.
No, that's not right.

136
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,255
You're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong.

137
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:57,992
You're running away.

138
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,426
How did you guess?

139
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,496
Professor Marvel never guesses.
He knows!

140
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:04,431
Why are you running away?

141
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:06,100
No, no. Don't tell me.

142
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:10,170
They don't understand you at home.
They don't appreciate you.

143
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:14,375
You want to see other lands, big cities,
big mountains, big oceans.

144
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,278
It's just like you could read
what was inside of me.

145
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,715
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

146
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,184
He's perfectly welcome.

147
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,954
As one dog to another, huh?

148
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Now, let's see. Where were we?

149
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:34,094
Please. Why can't we go with you
and see all the crowned heads of Europe?

150
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,430
Do you know any? You mean, the thing.

151
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:41,769
I never do anything without consulting
my crystal first.

152
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,006
Let's go inside here.
Just come along. I'll show you.

153
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,210
That's right. Here, sit right down here.
That's it.

154
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:56,083
This is the same genuine, magic,
authentic crystal...

155
00:12:56,517 --> 00:13:01,021
...used by the priests of Isis and Osiris
in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt...

156
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:06,226
...in which Cleopatra first saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony and...

157
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:08,495
...and so on and so on.

158
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,533
You'd better close your eyes, my child...

159
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,271
...for a moment, in order to be better
in tune with the infinite.

160
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,442
We can't do these things without...

161
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:24,111
...reaching out into the infinite.

162
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:29,316
That's all right. Now, you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.

163
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,320
What's this I see?

164
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,489
A house with a picket fence...

165
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,625
...and a barn with a weathervane...

166
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,761
...of a running horse.

167
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:42,763
That's our farm!

168
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,432
Yes. There's a woman.

169
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,802
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.

170
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,171
Her face is careworn.

171
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:52,873
That's Aunt Em.

172
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,908
Yes. Her name is Emily.

173
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:57,344
That's right. What's she doing?

174
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,780
Well, I can't quite see.

175
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,815
Why, she's crying!

176
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:06,053
Someone has hurt her.
Someone has just about broken her heart.

177
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,755
Me?

178
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:11,125
Well, it's someone she loves very much...

179
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:15,396
...someone she's been very kind to,
someone she's taken care of in sickness.

180
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:20,367
I had the measles once
and she stayed right by me every minute.

181
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:23,304
What's she doing now?

182
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:26,106
What's this?

183
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,976
Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!

184
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,679
She's dropping down on the bed!

185
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,813
Oh, no!

186
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,749
Well, that's all. The crystal's gone dark.

187
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,420
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

188
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,355
I've got to go home right away!

189
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,691
I thought you were going along with me!

190
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,894
No, I have to get to her right away!
Come on, Toto!

191
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,329
Come on! Come on!

192
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,367
Goodbye, Professor Marvel,
and thanks a lot!

193
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:59,673
Better get under cover, Sylvester!
There's a storm blowing, a whopper...

194
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,476
...to speak in the vernacular
of the peasantry!

195
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,846
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.

196
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:18,859
Hurry up and get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory? Hickory! Hickory!

197
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,328
Doggone it! Hickory!

198
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:24,932
It's a twister! It's a twister!

199
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,574
Dorothy!

200
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,247
Dorothy!

201
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,594
Come on, everybody in the storm cellar!

202
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:05,940
Henry! I can't find Dorothy!
She's somewhere out in the storm!

203
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,274
Dorothy!

204
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:36,870
Auntie Em!

205
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,173
Auntie Em!

206
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,876
Auntie Em!

207
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,188
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

208
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:05,399
Auntie Em!

209
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,103
We must be up inside the cyclone!

210
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,475
Miss Gulch!

211
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,260
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

212
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:06,507
We must be over the rainbow!

213
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:39,206
Now, I know we're not in Kansas.

214
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:44,778
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

215
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:47,548
Who, me?

216
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,052
I'm not a witch at all.
I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

217
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:55,055
Well, is that the witch?

218
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:56,190
Who, Toto?

219
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,691
Toto's my dog.

220
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,660
Well, I'm a little muddled.

221
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:03,230
The Munchkins called me because
a new witch has just dropped a house...

222
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:07,534
...on the Wicked Witch of the East.
And there's the house, and here you are...

223
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:11,038
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

224
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:13,841
What the Munchkins want to know is...

225
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:16,243
...are you a good witch or a bad witch?

226
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:19,780
But, I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.

227
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:21,582
Witches are old and ugly.

228
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:25,252
What was that?

229
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,923
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because I am a witch.

230
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,525
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

231
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:32,760
You are?

232
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,229
I beg your pardon!

233
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:38,299
But I've never heard
of a beautiful witch before.

234
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,734
Only bad witches are ugly.

235
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:45,839
The Munchkins are happy. You freed them
from the Wicked Witch of the East.

236
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,409
But, if you please, what are Munchkins?

237
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,979
The little people who live in this land.
It's Munchkin Land...

238
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:54,648
...and you are their national heroine,
my dear.

239
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:58,118
It's all right, you may all come out
and thank her.

240
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:02,856
<i>* Come out, come out wherever you are *</i>

241
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,128
<i>* And meet the young lady *</i>
<i>* who fell from a star *</i>

242
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,403
<i>* She fell from the sky, she fell very far *</i>

243
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:21,408
<i>* And Kansas, she says, *</i>
<i>* is the name of the star *</i>

244
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:25,646
<i>* Kansas, she says, is the name of the star *</i>

245
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:34,221
<i>* She brings you good news, *</i>
<i>* or haven't you heard? *</i>

246
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:39,393
<i>* When she fell out of Kansas *</i>
<i>* a miracle occurred *</i>

247
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,734
<i>* It really was no miracle *</i>
<i>* What happened was just this: *</i>

248
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,104
<i>* The wind began to switch, *</i>
<i>* the house to pitch *</i>

249
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:53,574
<i>* And suddenly the hinges started *</i>
<i>* to unhitch *</i>

250
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:57,011
<i>* Just then the Witch, to satisfy an itch *</i>

251
00:23:57,244 --> 00:24:00,481
<i>* Went flying on her broomstick *</i>
<i>* thumbing for a hitch *</i>

252
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,417
<i>* And, oh, what happened then was rich *</i>

253
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:07,621
<i>* The house began to pitch, *</i>
<i>* the kitchen took a slitch *</i>

254
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,658
<i>* It landed on the Wicked Witch *</i>
<i>* in the middle of a ditch *</i>

255
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:15,396
<i>* Which was not a healthy situation *</i>
<i>* for the Wicked Witch *</i>

256
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:19,333
<i>* The house began to pitch, *</i>
<i>* the kitchen took a slitch *</i>

257
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,369
<i>* It landed on the Wicked Witch *</i>
<i>* in the middle of a ditch *</i>

258
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:27,107
<i>* Which was not a healthy situation *</i>
<i>* for the Wicked Witch *</i>

259
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:31,512
<i>* Who began to twitch, *</i>
<i>* and was reduced to just a stitch *</i>

260
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:35,950
<i>* Of what was once the Wicked Witch *</i>

261
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:43,924
<i>* We thank you very sweetly *</i>

262
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:46,126
<i>* For doing it so neatly *</i>

263
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:49,063
<i>* You've killed her so completely *</i>

264
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:52,066
<i>* That we thank you very sweetly *</i>

265
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,902
<i>* Let the joyous news be spread *</i>

266
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:57,705
<i>* The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead! *</i>

267
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:04,245
<i>* Ding-dong the Witch is dead *</i>
<i>* Which old witch? *</i>

268
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:07,948
<i>* The Wicked Witch *</i>
<i>* Ding-dong the Wicked Witch is dead *</i>

269
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:13,020
<i>* Wake up, you sleepyhead *</i>
<i>* Rub your eyes, get out of bed *</i>

270
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:15,389
<i>* Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead *</i>

271
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,394
<i>* She's gone where the goblins go *</i>
<i>* Below, below, below *</i>

272
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:24,431
<i>* Yo-ho, let's open up and sing *</i>
<i>* and ring the bells out *</i>

273
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:28,168
<i>* Ding-dong the merry-oh, *</i>
<i>* sing it high, sing it low *</i>

274
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:32,206
<i>* Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead *</i>

275
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,262
<i>* As Mayor of the Munchkin City *</i>

276
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:58,532
<i>* In the county of the Land of Oz *</i>

277
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:02,570
<i>* I welcome you most regally *</i>

278
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,307
<i>* But we've got to verify it legally *</i>

279
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,075
<i>* -To see *</i>
<i>* -To see *</i>

280
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,677
<i>* -If she *</i>
<i>* -If she *</i>

281
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,745
<i>* Is morally, ethically *</i>

282
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,380
<i>* Spiritually, physically *</i>

283
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,982
<i>* Positively, absolutely *</i>

284
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,753
<i>* Undeniably and reliably dead. *</i>

285
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:30,097
<i>* As Coroner I must aver *</i>

286
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:33,133
<i>* I thoroughly examined her *</i>

287
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:36,136
<i>* And she's not only merely dead *</i>

288
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:39,373
<i>* She's really most sincerely dead *</i>

289
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,679
<i>* Then this is a day of independence *</i>
<i>* for all the Munchkins... *</i>

290
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,181
<i>* ...and their descendants *</i>

291
00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:48,215
<i>* If any *</i>

292
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,684
<i>* Yes, let the joyous news be spread *</i>

293
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,520
<i>* The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead! *</i>

294
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:57,458
<i>* Ding-dong the Witch is dead *</i>
<i>* Which old witch? The Wicked Witch! *</i>

295
00:26:57,524 --> 00:27:00,494
<i>* Ding-dong the Wicked Witch is dead *</i>

296
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:04,665
<i>* Wake up, you sleepyhead *</i>
<i>* Rub your eyes, get out of bed *</i>

297
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,867
<i>* Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead *</i>

298
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:11,739
<i>* She's gone where the goblins go *</i>
<i>* Below, below, below *</i>

299
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:15,676
<i>* Yo-ho, let's open up and sing *</i>

300
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:19,280
<i>* Ding-dong the merry-oh, *</i>
<i>* sing it high, sing it low *</i>

301
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,316
<i>* Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead! *</i>

302
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,210
<i>* We represent the Lullaby League *</i>

<i>* The Lullaby League, the Lullaby League *</i>

304
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:57,618
<i>* And in the name of the Lullaby League *</i>

305
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:02,389
<i>* We wish to welcome you *</i>

306
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,102
<i>* We represent the Lollypop Guild *</i>

307
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,572
<i>* The Lollypop Guild, the Lollypop Guild *</i>

308
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:22,643
<i>* And in the name of the Lollypop Guild *</i>

309
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:26,947
<i>* We wish to welcome you *</i>
<i>* to Munchkin Land *</i>

310
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,952
<i>* We welcome you to Munchkin Land *</i>

311
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,928
<i>* From now on you'll be history *</i>

312
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:43,430
<i>* -You'll be history *</i>
<i>* -You'll be history *</i>

313
00:28:43,497 --> 00:28:47,167
<i>* And we will glorify your name *</i>

314
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:48,569
<i>* You'll be a bust *</i>

315
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:49,904
<i>* -Be a bust *</i>
<i>* -Be a bust *</i>

316
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,539
<i>* In the hall of fame *</i>

317
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,938
I thought you said she was dead.

318
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:26,507
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

319
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:30,210
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

320
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:34,148
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?

321
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:36,016
Was it you?

322
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:39,987
No, no. It was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

323
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,424
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents, too!

324
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,593
Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?

325
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,261
The slippers, yes!

326
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:49,964
The slippers!

327
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:58,505
They're gone!

328
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:00,941
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?

329
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,910
Give them back to me or I'll--

330
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:04,778
It's too late! There they are...

331
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,547
...and there they'll stay!

332
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,219
Give me back my slippers!

333
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:14,154
I'm the only one who knows
how to use them.

334
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:16,757
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me.

335
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:19,293
-Give them back!
-Keep tight inside of them.

336
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,730
Their magic must be very powerful,
or she wouldn't want them so badly.

337
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:25,833
You stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well!

338
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,068
Rubbish! You have no power here.

339
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:31,205
Begone, before somebody drops a house
on you, too!

340
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:34,008
Very well, I'll bide my time.

341
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:36,677
And as for you, my fine lady...

342
00:30:36,777 --> 00:30:39,680
...it's true I can't attend to you
here and now as I'd like...

343
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:42,016
...but just try to stay out of my way.

344
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:43,217
Just try!

345
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:46,954
I'll get you, my pretty,
and your little dog, too!

346
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:01,302
It's all right. You can get up. She's gone.

347
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:04,438
It's all right. You can all get up.

348
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,508
What a smell of sulphur!

349
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,778
I'm afraid you've made a bad enemy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

350
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:15,149
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

351
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,352
I'd give anything to get out of Oz
altogether, but...

352
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:22,623
...which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.

353
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,726
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...

354
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,263
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself!

355
00:31:29,697 --> 00:31:32,766
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?

356
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,937
Very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City...

357
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:41,275
...and that's a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?

358
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:43,444
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

359
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,346
Well, then, you'll have to walk.

360
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:48,949
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkin Land.

361
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,487
And remember, never let those
ruby slippers off your feet for a moment...

362
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:57,324
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

363
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:00,761
But how do I start for Emerald City?

364
00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:03,097
It's always best to start at the beginning...

365
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:06,033
...and all you do
is follow the Yellow Brick Road.

366
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,112
But, what happens if l--

367
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,714
Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

368
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,484
Goodbye. Goodbye.

369
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:38,465
My!

370
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,535
People come and go so quickly here!

371
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:46,373
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

372
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,911
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

373
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:54,315
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

374
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,585
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

375
00:32:57,985 --> 00:32:59,887
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

376
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:01,689
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

377
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:05,192
<i>* Follow the Yellow Brick Road *</i>
<i>* Follow the Yellow Brick Road *</i>

378

<i>* If ever a Wiz there was *</i>

382
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:29,783

383
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,254

385

<i>* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz *</i>

386
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:00,814
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

387
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:03,584
Follow the Yellow....

388
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:05,853
Now which way do we go?

389
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,789
Pardon me. That way is a very nice way.

390
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:13,727
Who said that?

391
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:20,100
Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows don't talk.

392
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,770
It's pleasant down that way, too.

393
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:25,639
That's funny.

394
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,375
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

395
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,811
Of course, people do go both ways.

396
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:37,518
You did say something, didn't you?

397
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,793
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

398
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:48,896
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.

399
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:52,066
I haven't got a brain, only straw.

400
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,669
How can you talk
if you haven't got a brain?

401
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,438
I don't know.

402
00:34:57,938 --> 00:35:01,609
But some people without brains
do an awful lot of talking, don't they?

403
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:03,711
Yes, I guess you're right.

404
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:08,415
Well, we haven't really met properly,
have we?

405
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,684
Why, no!

406
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:12,119
How do you do?

407
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,520
How do you do?

408
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:14,822
Very well, thank you.

409
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:16,757
I'm not feeling at all well.

410
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:22,229
It's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

411
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:26,367
That must be terribly uncomfortable.
Can't you get down?

412
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:29,303
Down? No, you see, I'm.... Well, I'm....

413
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:31,605
Well, here, let me help you.

414
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,541
That's very kind of you, very kind.

415
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:38,145
I don't quite see how....

416
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:41,415
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things...

417
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:46,353
...but if you'll just bend the nail down
in the back, maybe I'll slip off and....

418
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:47,588
Oh, yes.

419
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,226
There goes some of me again!

420
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:53,360
Does it hurt you?

421
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:57,298
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

422
00:35:57,598 --> 00:35:59,667
My! It's good to be free!

423
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,270
Did I scare you?

424
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,407
No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself.

425
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,108
But I didn't scare you?

426
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:09,710
No, of course not.

427
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,445
I didn't think so.

428
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:20,688
You see, I can't even scare a crow.

429
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:25,326
They come from miles around
just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.

430
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,696
I'm a failure because I haven't got a brain!

431
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:32,366
What would you do with a brain
if you had one?

432
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:35,236
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could....

433
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:39,440
<i>* I could wile away the hours *</i>
<i>* Conferrin' with the flowers *</i>

434
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:41,875
<i>* Consultin' with the rain *</i>

435
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,248
<i>* And my head I'd be scratchin' *</i>
<i>* While my thoughts were busy hatchin' *</i>

436
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:49,316
<i>* If I only had a brain *</i>

437
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:54,321
<i>* I'd unravel every riddle *</i>
<i>* For any individual *</i>

438
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:56,657
<i>* In trouble or in pain *</i>

439
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:02,062
<i>* With the thoughts you'll be thinkin' *</i>
<i>* You could be another Lincoln *</i>

440
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:04,198
<i>* If you only had a brain *</i>

441
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,203
<i>* Oh, I would tell you why *</i>

442
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,940
<i>* The ocean's near the shore *</i>

443
00:37:13,674 --> 00:37:16,744
<i>* I could think of things *</i>
<i>* I never thunk before *</i>

444
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:20,047
<i>* And then I'd sit and think some more *</i>

445
00:37:20,814 --> 00:37:22,716
<i>* I would not be just a nothin' *</i>

446
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:26,787
<i>* My head all full of stuffin' *</i>
<i>* My heart all full of pain *</i>

447
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:31,992
<i>* I would dance and be merry *</i>
<i>* Life would be a ding-a-derry *</i>

448
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,094
<i>* If I only had a brain *</i>

449
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,266
Wonderful!

450
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:44,271
If our scarecrow back in Kansas could
do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!

451
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:45,773
-They would?
-Yes.

452
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:46,974
Where's Kansas?

453
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,375
That's where I live.

454
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:51,579
I want to get back there so badly
I'm going to Emerald City...

455
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,714
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

456
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:56,016
You're going to see a wizard?

457
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,120
Do you think if I went with you
this wizard would give me some brains?

458
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,655
I couldn't say.

459
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:05,759
But even if he didn't,
you'd be no worse off than you are now.

460
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,728
Yes, that's true.

461
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:11,599
You'd better not. I've got a witch
mad at me and you might get into trouble.

462
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:12,800
Witch?

463
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:16,003
I'm not afraid of a witch.
I'm not afraid of anything!

464
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:20,140
Except a lighted match.

465
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:21,709
I don't blame you for that.

466
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:25,880
But I'd face a whole box full of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

467
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,584
I won't be any trouble
because I don't eat a thing.

468
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:33,954
I won't try to manage things
because I can't think.

469
00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:36,457
Won't you take me with you?

470
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:38,492
Of course, I will!

471
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,662
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

472
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:44,131
Well, you're not starting out very well.

473
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,500
I'll try! Really, I will.

474
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,669
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

475
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:52,940
<i>* We're off to see the Wizard *</i>

<i>* If ever a Wiz there was *</i>

477
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,381

478
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:03,484

479

<i>* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz *</i>

481
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,875
Apples!

482
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:30,578
Oh, look!

483
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,422
What do you think you're doing?

484
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:46,427
We've been walking a long ways
and I was hungry and....

485
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,996
Did you say something?

486
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:51,165
-She was hungry!
-She was hungry!

487
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:55,336
How would you like to have someone
come along and pick something off of you?

488
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:59,039
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

489
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:03,711
Come along, Dorothy,
you don't want any of those apples.

490
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,113
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they should be?

491
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,917
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like
little green worms!

492
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:11,118
You!

493
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,359
I'll show you how to get apples.

494
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:28,068
Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.

495
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,762
Why, it's a man!

496
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:58,465
A man made out of tin!

497
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,334
-What?
-Yes.

498
00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:03,571
Look!

499
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,473
Oilcan.

500
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:09,510
Did you say something?

501
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:10,711
Oilcan.

502
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:13,414
He said, "Oilcan."

503
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:15,049
"Oilcan" what?

504
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:16,283
Oilcan?

505
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,854
Here it is!

506
00:41:21,622 --> 00:41:24,458
-Where do you want to be oiled first?
-My mouth.

507
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:26,560
-My mouth.
-He said his mouth.

508
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:32,199
The other side.

509
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,045
My goodness, I can talk again!

510
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,515
Oil my arms, please, oil my elbows.

511
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:50,985
Here.

512
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:55,923
Did that hurt?

513
00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:00,227
No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that axe up for ages.

514
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,096
Goodness!

515
00:42:02,363 --> 00:42:04,565
How did you ever get like this?

516
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:10,104
About a year ago,
I was chopping that tree...

517
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:12,439
...when suddenly it began to rain.

518
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:16,110
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.

519
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:18,979
I've been that way ever since.

520
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:24,084
Well, you're perfect now.

521
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:25,886
My neck. My neck.

522
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,488
Perfect?

523
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:30,524
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.

524
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,593
Go ahead, bang on it.

525
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:37,264
Beautiful! What an echo!

526
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,400
It's empty.

527
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:43,170
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

528
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:45,372
No heart?

529
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,274
No heart.

530
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:49,476
All hollow.

531
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,417
<i>* When a man's an empty kettle *</i>

532
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:59,119
<i>* He should be on his mettle *</i>

533
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:01,855

534
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,726

537
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,902
<i>* I'd be tender, I'd be gentle *</i>

538
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,471
<i>* And awful sentimental *</i>

539
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,907
<i>* Regarding love and art *</i>

540
00:43:21,575 --> 00:43:23,911

541
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:26,280

542

545
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:46,600

546
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:48,836
<i>* ...how sweet! *</i>

547
00:43:48,903 --> 00:43:53,407
<i>* Just to register emotion, *</i>

548
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:56,977

549
00:43:58,145 --> 00:44:00,481

550
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:03,117

551
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:07,955
<i>* If I only had a heart *</i>

552
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:34,074
-Are you all right?
-I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

553
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:35,309
Oh, dear!

554
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:38,012
That was wonderful!

555
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:39,947
You know....

556
00:45:40,881 --> 00:45:44,251
We were wondering why you couldn't
come with us to the Emerald City...

557
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:46,153
...to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart?

558
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,323
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one
when we got there?

559
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,926
But he will! He must!

560
00:45:52,693 --> 00:45:55,195
We've come such a long way already.

561
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,970
You call that long?

562
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:04,939
Why, you've just begun!

563
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:09,076
Helping the little lady along, are you,
my fine gentlemen?

564
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,245
Well, stay away from her...

565
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:13,547
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

566
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:16,083
And you!

567
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:18,752
I'll use you for a beehive!

568
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:21,622
Here, Scarecrow! Want to play ball?

569
00:46:25,693 --> 00:46:28,996
Lookout! I'm burning! I'm burning!

570
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:45,479
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely
to the Wizard now...

571
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:49,650
...whether I get a brain or not!
"Stuff a mattress with me," hah!

572
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,888
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

573
00:46:53,954 --> 00:46:57,992
"Beehive," bah! Let her try
and make a beehive out of me!

574
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:04,198
You're the best friends anybody ever had.

575
00:47:04,632 --> 00:47:08,502
And it's funny, but I feel
as if I've known you all the time.

576
00:47:09,169 --> 00:47:10,905
But I couldn't have, could l?

577
00:47:10,971 --> 00:47:15,042
I don't see how. You weren't around
when I was stuffed and sewn together...

578
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:16,010
...were you?

579
00:47:16,076 --> 00:47:19,747
And I was standing over there rusting
for the longest time.

580
00:47:19,914 --> 00:47:24,418
Still, I wish I could remember.
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.

581
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:27,421
We know each other now, don't we?

582
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:29,523
-That's right.
-We do.

583
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,325
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

584

590
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,673
I don't like this forest!

591
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:23,177
It's dark and creepy!

592
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:29,316
Of course, I don't know, but I think
it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

593
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,321
Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

594
00:48:34,388 --> 00:48:35,556
We might.

595
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,159
Animals that eat straw?

596
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,897
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

597
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:43,831
Lions!

598
00:48:43,898 --> 00:48:44,765
And tigers!

599
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:45,966
And bears!

600
00:48:47,401 --> 00:48:50,437
Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!

-Lions and tigers and bears!
-Oh, my!

00:49:04,852 --> 00:49:05,853
Oh, look!

606

Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

607
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:31,779

608
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,548
I'll fight you both together, if you want.

609
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:37,618
I'll fight you with one paw tied
behind my back!

610
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:40,120
I'll fight you standing on one foot!

611
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,323
I'll fight you with my eyes closed.

612
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:46,160
Pulling an axe on me, eh?

613
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:49,330
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why....

614
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:55,135
-Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
-Scared, huh?

615
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:56,837
Afraid, huh?

616
00:49:57,471 --> 00:50:00,140
How long can you stay fresh in that can?

617
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,445
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard!

618
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,616
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

619
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:10,651
Now, that's getting personal, Lion.

620
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:13,587
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

621
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:16,223
Well, what's wrong with you teaching him?

622
00:50:16,357 --> 00:50:18,459
Well, I hardly know him.

623
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:22,129
I'll get you anyway, Pee-Wee.

624
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,141
Shame on you!

625
00:50:34,608 --> 00:50:37,978
What did you do that for? I didn't bite him.

626
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,947
No, but you tried to.

627
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:44,218
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but when you pick on poor little dogs....

628
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:46,954
You didn't have to go and hit me, did you?

629
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:50,190
Is my nose bleeding?

630
00:50:50,491 --> 00:50:51,959
Well, of course not.

631
00:50:54,295 --> 00:50:56,764
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!

632
00:50:56,897 --> 00:51:01,101
Naturally, when you go around
picking on things weaker than you are...

633
00:51:01,168 --> 00:51:03,337
...you're nothing but a great, big coward!

634
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:05,606
You're right, I am a coward!

635
00:51:06,974 --> 00:51:08,943
I haven't any courage at all.

636
00:51:09,476 --> 00:51:11,312
I even scare myself.

637
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,015
Look at the circles under my eyes.

638
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:16,917
I haven't slept in weeks.

639
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:19,386
Why don't you try counting sheep?

640
00:51:19,486 --> 00:51:22,556
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.

641
00:51:24,024 --> 00:51:25,359
That's too bad.

642
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:29,263
Don't you think
the Wizard could help him, too?

643
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,798
I don't see why not.

644
00:51:31,265 --> 00:51:33,067
Why don't you come along with us?

645
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:36,003
We're on our way to see the Wizard now.
To get him a heart.

646
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,204
And him a brain.

647
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:39,340
I'm sure he could give you some courage.

648
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:44,445
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

649
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:46,180
I would.

650
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:48,749
No, of course not!

651
00:51:49,683 --> 00:51:52,386
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

652
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,457
My life has been simply unbearable.

653
00:51:57,324 --> 00:52:01,195
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.

654
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:04,131
It's been in me so long...

655
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:07,301
...I just gotta tell you how I feel.

656
00:52:07,968 --> 00:52:09,403
Well, come on!

657
00:52:09,937 --> 00:52:14,041
<i>* Yeah, it's sad, believe me, missy *</i>
<i>* When you're born to be a sissy *</i>

658
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,343
<i>* Without the vim and verve *</i>

659
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:19,880
<i>* But I could show my prowess *</i>

660
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,982
<i>* Be a lion not a mouse *</i>

661
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:24,385
<i>* If I only had the nerve *</i>

662
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,922
<i>* I'm afraid there's no denyin' *</i>

663
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:30,191
<i>* I'm just a dandelion *</i>

664
00:52:30,257 --> 00:52:32,259
<i>* A fate I don't deserve *</i>

665
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:35,763
<i>* I'd be brave as a blizzard *</i>

666
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,831
<i>* I'd be gentle as a lizard *</i>

667
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:39,900
<i>* I'd be clever as a gizzard *</i>

668
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,003
<i>* If the Wizard is a wizard who will serve *</i>

669
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:47,074
<i>* Then I'm sure to get a brain *</i>

670
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:48,375
<i>* A heart *</i>

671
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:49,443
<i>* A home *</i>

672
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,644
<i>* The nerve. *</i>

673
00:52:53,013 --> 00:52:56,617
<i>* We're off to see the Wizard *</i>
<i>* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz *</i>

674
00:52:56,684 --> 00:53:00,087
<i>* We hear he is a whiz of a Wiz *</i>
<i>* If ever a Wiz there was *</i>

675
00:53:00,154 --> 00:53:03,524
<i>* If ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was *</i>
<i>* The Wizard of Oz is one because *</i>

676
00:53:03,591 --> 00:53:06,627
<i>* Because, because, because, *</i>
<i>* because, because *</i>

677
00:53:07,127 --> 00:53:09,530
<i>* Because of the wonderful things he does *</i>

678
00:53:10,564 --> 00:53:14,301
<i>* We're off to see the Wizard *</i>
<i>* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz *</i>

679
00:53:23,344 --> 00:53:25,746
So, you won't take warning, eh?

680
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:27,581
All the worse for you!

681
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:30,684
I'll take care of you now instead of later!

682
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:38,926
When I gain those ruby slippers,
my power will be the greatest in Oz!

683
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:43,364
And now, my beauties...

684
00:53:43,731 --> 00:53:46,567
...something with poison in it, I think.

685
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:48,802
With poison in it...

686
00:53:49,403 --> 00:53:51,338
...but attractive to the eye...

687
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:53,807
...and soothing to the smell!

688
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,311
Poppies!

689
00:53:58,512 --> 00:53:59,513
Poppies!

690
00:54:00,915 --> 00:54:03,183
Poppies will put them to sleep.

691
00:54:04,585 --> 00:54:05,719
Sleep.

692
00:54:06,754 --> 00:54:09,256
Now they'll sleep.

693
00:54:39,386 --> 00:54:41,021
There's Emerald City!

694
00:54:41,188 --> 00:54:43,924
We're almost there at last! At last!

695
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:48,462
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

696
00:54:49,163 --> 00:54:52,466
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that!

697
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,335
Come on. What are we waiting for?

698
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:55,769
Nothing! Let's hurry!

699
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,238
Yes, let's run!

700
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:03,410
Come on, come on!

701
00:55:03,477 --> 00:55:04,745
Hurry! Hurry!

702
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:09,817
Look!

703
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:13,087
Come on!

704
00:55:13,487 --> 00:55:14,488
The city!

705
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,891
It's wonderful! The Emerald City!

706
00:55:22,596 --> 00:55:23,964
What's happening?

707
00:55:24,298 --> 00:55:25,666
What is it?

708
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:27,801
I can't run anymore.

709
00:55:28,669 --> 00:55:29,670
I'm so sleepy.

710
00:55:29,737 --> 00:55:31,906
Give us your hands
and we'll pull you along.

711
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:33,107
No, please.

712
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,543
I have to rest for just a minute.

713
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:36,644
Toto....

714
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,912
Where's Toto?

715
00:55:38,345 --> 00:55:40,648
You can't rest now. We're nearly there.

716
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:45,586
Don't cry, you'll rust yourself again!

717
00:55:45,653 --> 00:55:48,956
Come to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

718
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:51,492
Don't you start it, too!

719
00:55:51,592 --> 00:55:54,195
No! We ought to try and carry Dorothy!

720
00:55:54,395 --> 00:55:56,497
I don't think I could, but we could try.

721
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:57,731
-Let's.
-Yes.

722
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:01,101
Now look at him! This is terrible!

723
00:56:01,168 --> 00:56:02,803
Here, Tin Man, help me.

724
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:08,108
This is terrible! I can't budge her an inch!

725
00:56:08,475 --> 00:56:10,177
This is a spell, this is!

726
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:12,613
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?

727
00:56:13,347 --> 00:56:14,348
Help!

728
00:56:14,848 --> 00:56:15,849
Help!

729
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:20,221
It's no use screaming at a time like this.
Nobody will hear you! Help!

730
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:22,423
Help!

731
00:56:27,561 --> 00:56:28,796
It's snowing!

732
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:31,565
No, it isn't!

733
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:34,268
Yes, it is!

734
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,504
Maybe that'll help!

735
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:40,274
But it couldn't help!

736
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:44,211
It does help! Dorothy, you're waking up!

737
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:54,288
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

738
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:57,191
Look, he's rusted again!

739
00:56:59,426 --> 00:57:02,162
-Give me the oilcan, quick!
-Here! Oil him.

740
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:04,398
-He is rusted.
-Here.

741
00:57:04,465 --> 00:57:05,933
Here. Quick!

742
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:11,872
Curses! Curses!
Somebody always helps that girl!

743
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:18,312
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.

744
00:57:18,379 --> 00:57:20,281
And woe to those who try to stop me!

745
00:57:20,414 --> 00:57:22,516
Come on, let's get out of here.

746
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:25,619
Look, Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever!

747
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:27,855
You're out of the dark

748
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:57,585
To the Emerald City as fast as lightning!

749
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:10,764
<i>* You're out of the woods *</i>
<i>* You're out of the dark *</i>

750
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:12,499
<i>* You're out of the night *</i>

751
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,969
<i>* Step into the sun, step into the light *</i>

752
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:18,806
<i>* March up to the gate *</i>
<i>* And bid it open *</i>

753
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:21,008
<i>* Open *</i>

754
00:58:27,248 --> 00:58:28,949
Who rang that bell?

755
00:58:29,049 --> 00:58:30,050
We did!

756
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:31,385
Can't you read?

757
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:33,187
-Read what?
-The notice!

758
00:58:33,754 --> 00:58:34,755
What notice?

759
00:58:34,822 --> 00:58:38,225
It's on the door, as plain as the nose
on my face!

760
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,704
"Bell out of order, please knock."

761
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,809
Well, that's more like it.

762
00:58:56,143 --> 00:58:57,845
Now, state your business.

763
00:58:58,112 --> 00:58:59,847
We want to see the Wizard.

764
00:59:01,815 --> 00:59:02,950
The Wizard?

765
00:59:03,817 --> 00:59:06,287
But nobody can see the great Oz!

766
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,524
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!

767
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,360
Well, then, how do you know there is one?

768
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:15,029
Because he's....

769
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:18,532
You're wasting my time!

770
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:21,235
Please! Please, sir!

771
00:59:21,635 --> 00:59:23,437
I've got to see the Wizard.

772
00:59:23,704 --> 00:59:25,839
The Good Witch of the North sent me.

773
00:59:25,906 --> 00:59:26,941
Prove it!

774
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:30,077
She's wearing the ruby slippers
she gave her!

775
00:59:34,415 --> 00:59:35,850
So she is!

776
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,319
Well, bust my buttons!

777
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:41,322
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

778
00:59:41,388 --> 00:59:44,625
That's a horse of a different color!
Come on in!

779
00:59:57,404 --> 01:00:00,474
Cabby! Cabby!
Just what you're looking for!

780
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:02,910
Take you any place in the city, we does!

781
01:00:02,977 --> 01:00:04,845
Would you take us to see the Wizard?

782
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:07,081
The Wizard? The Wizard?

783
01:00:09,617 --> 01:00:10,918
Yes, of course.

784
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:14,822
But first I'll take you to a little place
where you can tidy up a bit.

785
01:00:15,055 --> 01:00:16,590
Thank you so much.

786
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:20,394
We've been gone such a long time,
and we feel so....

787
01:00:21,896 --> 01:00:26,267
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!

788
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:30,304
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.

789
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,874
He's the Horse of a Different Color
you've heard tell about.

790
01:00:34,575 --> 01:00:36,377
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>
<i>* Ho, ho, ho *</i>

791
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:38,479
<i>* And a couple of tra-la-las *</i>

792
01:00:38,546 --> 01:00:42,483
<i>* That's how we laugh the day away *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

793
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:44,785
<i>* Bzz, bzz, bzz *</i>
<i>* Chirp, chirp, chirp *</i>

794
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:46,854
<i>* And a couple of la-di-das *</i>

795
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:50,591
<i>* That's how the crickets crick all day *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

796
01:00:50,824 --> 01:00:53,894
<i>* We get up at 12:00 *</i>
<i>* And start to work at 1:00 *</i>

797
01:00:54,929 --> 01:00:58,165
<i>* Take an hour for lunch *</i>
<i>* And then at 2:00 we're done *</i>

798
01:00:58,332 --> 01:00:59,433
<i>* Jolly good fun! *</i>

799
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,268
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>
<i>* Ho, ho, ho *</i>

800
01:01:01,335 --> 01:01:03,070

801
01:01:03,504 --> 01:01:07,274
<i>* That's how we laugh the day away *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

802
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:09,610
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>
<i>* Ho, ho, ho *</i>

803
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:11,445
<i>* Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha *</i>

804
01:01:11,712 --> 01:01:13,681
<i>* That's how we laugh the day away *</i>

805
01:01:13,747 --> 01:01:15,816
<i>* With a ho, ho, ho *</i>
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>

806
01:01:15,983 --> 01:01:18,085
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

807
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:22,089
<i>* Pat, pat here, pat, pat there *</i>
<i>* And a couple of brand new straws *</i>

808
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:26,126
<i>* That's how we keep you young and fair *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

809
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:30,464
<i>* Rub, rub here, rub, rub there *</i>
<i>* Whether you're tin or brass *</i>

810
01:01:30,664 --> 01:01:34,435
<i>* That's how we keep you in repair *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

811
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:37,738
<i>* We can make a dimple smile *</i>
<i>* Out of a frown *</i>

812
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:41,642
<i>* Can you even dye my eyes *</i>
<i>* To match my gown? *</i>

813
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:43,511
<i>* Jolly old town! *</i>

814
01:01:43,577 --> 01:01:47,448
<i>* Clip, clip here, clip, clip there *</i>
<i>* We give the roughest claws *</i>

815
01:01:47,515 --> 01:01:51,252
<i>* That certain air of savoir faire *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

816
01:01:51,752 --> 01:01:52,753
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>

817
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,821
<i>* Ho, ho, ho *</i>

818
01:01:53,888 --> 01:01:55,489
<i>* Ha, ha, ha, ha *</i>

819
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:59,360
<i>* That's how we laugh the day away *</i>
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

820
01:01:59,693 --> 01:02:01,762
<i>* That's how we laugh the day away *</i>

821
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,631
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>

822
01:02:03,731 --> 01:02:05,533
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>

823
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:07,468
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>
<i>* Ha, ha, ha *</i>

824
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:09,403
<i>* In the Merry Old Land of Oz *</i>

825
01:02:27,621 --> 01:02:29,190
Who's her? Who's her?

826
01:02:29,823 --> 01:02:32,526
It's the Witch! She's followed us here!

827
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:34,562
"Surrender Dorothy."

828
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,932
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

829
01:02:37,998 --> 01:02:39,266
The Wizard will explain it!

830
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,000
To the Wizard!

831
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:41,335
To the Wizard!

832
01:02:42,136 --> 01:02:43,671
Whatever shall we do?

833
01:02:43,737 --> 01:02:46,207
We'd better hurry
if we're going to see the Wizard!

834
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:51,846
Here! Here, here! Everything is all right.

835
01:02:52,012 --> 01:02:53,647
Stop that now.

836
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:56,517
It's all right! Everything is all right!

837
01:02:56,584 --> 01:03:01,488
The great and powerful Oz
has got matters well in hand. I hope.

838
01:03:02,122 --> 01:03:04,191
And so you can all go home!

839
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:06,126
And there's nothing to worry about!

840
01:03:06,193 --> 01:03:08,896
Get out of here now, go on!
Go on home and....

841
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:11,265
Go home.

842
01:03:12,132 --> 01:03:14,702
If you please, we want to see
the Wizard right away.

843
01:03:14,768 --> 01:03:15,836
All four of us.

844
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:18,539
Orders are: Nobody can see the great Oz!

845
01:03:18,606 --> 01:03:20,274
Not nobody, not nohow!

846
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,143
But, please. It's very important.

847
01:03:23,477 --> 01:03:25,779
And I got a permanent
just for the occasion.

848
01:03:25,846 --> 01:03:28,048
Not nobody, not nohow!

849
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:29,984
But she's Dorothy!

850
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:32,286
The Witch's Dorothy?

851
01:03:34,455 --> 01:03:36,557
Well, that makes a difference.

852
01:03:37,925 --> 01:03:40,461
Wait here. I'll announce you at once!

853
01:03:45,132 --> 01:03:47,768
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once!

854
01:03:47,868 --> 01:03:51,171
-I've as good as got my brain!
-I can fairly hear my heart beating.

855
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:55,309
-I'll be home in time for supper!
-In another hour I'll be King of the Forest.

856
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:57,578
Long live the King!

857
01:04:05,419 --> 01:04:09,690
<i>* If I were King of the Forest *</i>

858
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:15,763
<i>* Not Queen, not Duke, not Prince *</i>

859
01:04:17,097 --> 01:04:20,801
<i>* My regal robes of the forest *</i>

860
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:26,640
<i>* Would be satin, not cotton, not chintz. *</i>

861
01:04:28,175 --> 01:04:31,645
<i>* I'd command each thing, be it fish or fowl *</i>

862
01:04:31,946 --> 01:04:36,951
<i>* With a woof and a woof, and a royal growl *</i>

863
01:04:39,486 --> 01:04:42,690
<i>* As I click my heel *</i>
<i>* All the trees would kneel *</i>

864
01:04:42,756 --> 01:04:46,527
<i>* And the mountains bow *</i>
<i>* And the bulls kowtow *</i>

865
01:04:48,495 --> 01:04:53,467
<i>* And the sparrow would take wing *</i>

866
01:04:55,436 --> 01:05:00,107
<i>* If I...if I were King! *</i>

867
01:05:03,477 --> 01:05:07,181
<i>* Each rabbit would show respect to me *</i>

868
01:05:07,448 --> 01:05:11,085
<i>* The chipmunks genuflect to me *</i>

869
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:14,488
<i>* Though my tail would lash *</i>
<i>* I would show compash *</i>

870
01:05:15,022 --> 01:05:18,025
<i>* For every underling *</i>

871
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:23,964
<i>* If I...if I were King *</i>

872
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,069
<i>* Just King! *</i>

873
01:06:02,236 --> 01:06:05,906
<i>* Monarch of all I survey *</i>

874
01:06:08,342 --> 01:06:12,346
<i>* Monarch... *</i>

875
01:06:13,414 --> 01:06:17,418
<i>* ...of all I survey! *</i>

876
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:23,724
Your Majesty, if you were King,
you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

877
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:26,727
Not nobody, not nohow!

878
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:29,463
-Not even a rhinoceros?
-Imposserous!

879
01:06:29,763 --> 01:06:33,868
-How about a hippopotamus?
-Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomus!

880
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:36,971
-Suppose you met an elephant?
-I'd wrap him up in cellophant!

881
01:06:37,037 --> 01:06:40,908
-What if it were a brontosaurus?
-I'd show him who was King of the Forest!

882
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:42,510
-How?
-How?

883
01:06:44,011 --> 01:06:45,012
Courage!

884
01:06:45,279 --> 01:06:47,214
What makes a king out of a slave?

885
01:06:47,281 --> 01:06:48,082
Courage!

886
01:06:48,148 --> 01:06:51,151
What makes the flag on the mast to wave?

887
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:52,653
Courage!

888
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,391
What makes the elephant charge his tusk
in the misty mist, or the dusky dusk?

889
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:01,762
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?

890
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,397
Courage!

891
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:05,799
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder?

892
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:06,734
Courage!

893
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,336
What makes the dawn come up
like thunder?

894
01:07:10,371 --> 01:07:11,438
Courage!

895
01:07:11,705 --> 01:07:13,741
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

896
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:15,876
What puts the "ape" in apricot?

897
01:07:16,143 --> 01:07:18,579
What have they got that I ain't got?

898
01:07:18,712 --> 01:07:19,446
Courage!

899
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:21,148
You can say that again.

900
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:27,588
The Wizard says, "Go away! "

901
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:35,029
Go away?

902
01:07:36,397 --> 01:07:39,366
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.

903
01:07:41,569 --> 01:07:43,370
And I was so happy!

904
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:46,440
I thought I was on my way home.

905
01:07:46,607 --> 01:07:47,942
Don't cry, Dorothy.

906
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:49,510
We'll get you to the Wizard.

907
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:51,178
We certainly are.

908
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:56,050
Auntie Em was so good to me,
and I never appreciated it.

909
01:07:56,917 --> 01:07:59,720
Running away and hurting her feelings.

910
01:08:00,387 --> 01:08:02,556
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

911
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:05,559
She may be dying...

912
01:08:06,193 --> 01:08:07,895
...and it's all my fault.

913
01:08:11,065 --> 01:08:12,800
I'll never forgive myself!

914
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:15,402
Never, never, never!

915
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:22,476
Please, don't cry anymore.

916
01:08:23,043 --> 01:08:26,113
I'll get you in to the Wizard somehow.

917
01:08:26,514 --> 01:08:30,050
Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once!

918
01:08:50,971 --> 01:08:53,807
Wait a minute, fellows.
I was just thinking....

919
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:56,477
I really don't want to see the Wizard
this much.

920
01:08:56,544 --> 01:08:58,512
I better wait for you outside.

921
01:08:58,646 --> 01:09:01,582
-What's the matter?
-He's just scared again.

922
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:04,385
Don't you know the Wizard
will give you some courage?

923
01:09:04,451 --> 01:09:07,087
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

924
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:09,924
Well then, we'll ask him for you.

925
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:11,959
I'd sooner wait outside.

926
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,794
Why? Why?

927
01:09:14,428 --> 01:09:16,964
Because I'm still scared!

928
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:24,505
-What happened?
-Somebody pulled my tail!

929
01:09:25,306 --> 01:09:26,807
You did it yourself!

930
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,511
Come on.

931
01:09:34,248 --> 01:09:36,584
Come forward!

932
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:38,686
Tell me when it's over!

933
01:09:49,997 --> 01:09:51,832
Look at that! Look at that!

934
01:09:56,003 --> 01:09:58,172
I want to go home!

935
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:01,909
I am Oz...

936
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:04,578
...the great and powerful!

937
01:10:05,145 --> 01:10:06,480
Who are you?

938
01:10:08,716 --> 01:10:10,317
Who are you?

939
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:19,059
If you please, I am Dorothy...

940
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,996
...the small and meek.

941
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:25,466
We've come to ask--

942
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:26,967
Silence!

943
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:30,104
Jiminy Crickets!

944
01:10:30,504 --> 01:10:35,376
The great and powerful Oz
knows why you have come.

945
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:39,580
Step forward, Tin Man!

946
01:10:45,986 --> 01:10:49,823
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

947
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:55,362
You clinking, clanking,
clattering collection of caliginous junk!

948
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,135
Yes, sir.

949
01:11:01,468 --> 01:11:02,837
Yes, Your Honor.

950
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:05,739
You see, a while back...

951
01:11:06,006 --> 01:11:08,576
...we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road, and--

952
01:11:08,642 --> 01:11:09,677
Quiet!

953
01:11:12,346 --> 01:11:14,481
And you, Scarecrow...

954
01:11:14,882 --> 01:11:17,585
...have the effrontery to ask for a brain...

955
01:11:18,385 --> 01:11:21,922
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!

956
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:26,460
Yes, Your Honor. I mean, Your Excellency.

957
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:28,362
I mean, Your Wizardry!

958
01:11:29,029 --> 01:11:29,997
Enough!

959
01:11:31,499 --> 01:11:33,467
And you, Lion!

960
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:40,741
Well?

961
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:49,850
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...

962
01:11:50,284 --> 01:11:53,187
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

963
01:11:53,254 --> 01:11:55,456
Silence, whippersnapper!

964
01:11:56,156 --> 01:12:00,828
The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests!

965
01:12:01,762 --> 01:12:04,899
What's that? What'd he say?
What'd he say?

966
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:08,769
But first,
you must prove yourselves worthy...

967
01:12:09,069 --> 01:12:12,506
...by performing a very small task.

968
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:17,011
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

969
01:12:17,811 --> 01:12:20,781
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it!

970
01:12:20,848 --> 01:12:23,150
Bring me her broomstick...

971
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,986
...and I'll grant your requests.

972
01:12:26,854 --> 01:12:28,155
Now, go!

973
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,492
But what if she kills us first?

974
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:33,227
I said, "Go!"

975
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,309
"I'd turn back if I were you! "

976
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:48,369
Oh, look!

977
01:13:53,374 --> 01:13:55,676
I believe there're spooks around here.

978
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,246
That's ridiculous! Spooks! That's silly.

979
01:13:59,713 --> 01:14:01,882
Don't you believe in spooks?

980
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:03,250
No. Why, only--

981
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:06,220
Tin Man!

982
01:14:13,994 --> 01:14:15,095
Are you all right?

983
01:14:15,162 --> 01:14:17,298
I do believe in spooks.
I do believe in spooks.

984
01:14:17,364 --> 01:14:19,099
I do, I do, I do, I do.

985
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,502
I do believe in spooks.
I do believe in spooks!

986
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:24,205
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!

987
01:14:25,673 --> 01:14:29,143
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

988
01:14:30,978 --> 01:14:34,348
Take your army to the Haunted Forest
and bring me the girl and her dog.

989
01:14:34,415 --> 01:14:37,785
Do as you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed!

990
01:14:37,852 --> 01:14:40,521
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.

991
01:14:40,588 --> 01:14:44,525
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

992
01:14:45,326 --> 01:14:50,097
Take special care of those ruby slippers.
I want those most of all. Now, fly!

993
01:14:50,431 --> 01:14:53,467
Fly! Bring me that girl and her slippers!

994
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:56,403
Fly! Fly! Fly!

995
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:25,399
Help!

996
01:15:25,466 --> 01:15:26,834
Help! Help!

997
01:15:27,468 --> 01:15:28,636
Go away now!

998
01:15:29,537 --> 01:15:30,704
Help! Help!

999
01:15:32,006 --> 01:15:34,775
Toto! Toto! Help! Toto!

1000
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:54,662
What happened to you?

1001
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:57,164
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

1002
01:15:57,231 --> 01:15:59,633
Then they took my chest out
and threw it over there!

1003
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:03,437
-Well, that's you all over.
-They sure knocked the stuffing out of you.

1004
01:16:03,504 --> 01:16:05,673
Don't stand there talking!
Put me together!

1005
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:07,241
We've got to find Dorothy!

1006
01:16:07,308 --> 01:16:08,676
Now, let's see....

1007
01:16:11,779 --> 01:16:13,747
What a nice little dog.

1008
01:16:18,419 --> 01:16:21,722
And you, my dear,
what an unexpected pleasure.

1009
01:16:22,256 --> 01:16:25,559
It's so kind of you to visit me
in my loneliness.

1010
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:31,031
What are you going to do with my dog?
Give him back to me!

1011
01:16:31,098 --> 01:16:35,503
All in good time, my little pretty,
all in good time.

1012
01:16:35,736 --> 01:16:37,771
Please, give me back my dog!

1013
01:16:37,838 --> 01:16:39,707
Certainly, certainly...

1014
01:16:40,307 --> 01:16:42,610
...when you give me those slippers.

1015
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:45,579
But the Good Witch of the North
told me not to.

1016
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:46,747
Very well.

1017
01:16:47,314 --> 01:16:49,450
Throw that basket in the river
and drown him.

1018
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:51,252
No! No. No. Here.

1019
01:16:51,418 --> 01:16:53,954
You can have your slippers
but give me back Toto!

1020
01:16:54,021 --> 01:16:55,823
That's a good little girl.

1021
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:58,125
I knew you'd see reason!

1022
01:17:01,795 --> 01:17:05,132
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1023
01:17:05,299 --> 01:17:08,302
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...

1024
01:17:09,803 --> 01:17:12,206
...those slippers will never come off...

1025
01:17:12,306 --> 01:17:14,842
...as long as you're alive.

1026
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,847
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.

1027
01:17:20,414 --> 01:17:22,783
These things must be done delicately...

1028
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:25,352
...or you hurt the spell.

1029
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,087
Run, Toto! Run!

1030
01:17:27,154 --> 01:17:28,656
Catch him, you fool!

1031
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:39,700
Run, Toto!

1032
01:17:41,435 --> 01:17:42,803
Run, Toto! Run!

1033
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:46,974
He got away! He got away!

1034
01:17:47,908 --> 01:17:51,445
Which is more than you will!
Drat you and your dog!

1035
01:17:51,779 --> 01:17:54,615
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth...

1036
01:17:54,682 --> 01:17:56,684
...but it'll soon be over now!

1037
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:03,324
Do you see that? That's how much longer
you've got to be alive!

1038
01:18:03,491 --> 01:18:06,393
And it isn't long, my pretty. It isn't long!

1039
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,963
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!

1040
01:18:31,385 --> 01:18:32,686
I'm frightened.

1041
01:18:33,754 --> 01:18:36,257
I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!

1042
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,728
Dorothy?

1043
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:43,864
Dorothy, where are you?

1044
01:18:44,298 --> 01:18:46,200
It's me, it's Auntie Em.

1045
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:49,370
We're trying to find you! Where are you?

1046
01:18:50,037 --> 01:18:52,006
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em!

1047
01:18:52,273 --> 01:18:54,575
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

1048
01:18:54,742 --> 01:18:57,578
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

1049
01:18:58,412 --> 01:19:01,482
Auntie Em, don't go away! I'm frightened!

1050
01:19:02,516 --> 01:19:04,285
Come back! Come back!

1051
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:07,087
"Auntie Em. Auntie Em, come back!"

1052
01:19:07,454 --> 01:19:09,623
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

1053
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:37,985
Look! There's Toto!

1054
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,221
Where'd he come from?

1055
01:19:41,722 --> 01:19:45,192
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy!

1056
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:48,762
Come on, fellows!

1057
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:09,650
I hope my strength holds out.

1058
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:11,619
I hope your tail holds out.

1059
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:25,866
What's that?

1060
01:20:26,934 --> 01:20:28,969
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!

1061
01:20:29,036 --> 01:20:30,838
Dorothy's in that awful place?

1062
01:20:30,905 --> 01:20:34,375
I hate to think of her in there.
We've got to get her out!

1063
01:20:34,508 --> 01:20:37,044
Don't cry now.
We haven't got the oilcan with us...

1064
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:39,180
...and you've been squeaking enough.

1065
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,881
Who's them?

1066
01:20:55,796 --> 01:20:57,865
I've got a plan how to get in there.

1067
01:20:57,932 --> 01:20:59,633
Fine. He's got a plan.

1068
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,102
-And you're going to lead us.
-Yeah.

1069
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,338
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1070
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:08,209
-I gotta get her out of there?
-That's right.

1071
01:21:09,677 --> 01:21:12,179
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy...

1072
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,682
...Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

1073
01:21:14,748 --> 01:21:17,585
...guards or no guards, I'll tear 'em apart.

1074
01:21:19,019 --> 01:21:22,189
I may not come out alive
but I'm going in there.

1075
01:21:22,623 --> 01:21:25,092
There's only one thing
I want you fellows to do.

1076
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:26,393
What's that?

1077
01:21:26,861 --> 01:21:28,295
Talk me out of it.

1078
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:32,266
-No, you don't!
-Oh, no!

1079
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,801
Now, wait a minute.

1080
01:22:34,695 --> 01:22:36,297
I've got another idea.

1081
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:38,999
Do you think it'll be polite,
dropping in like this?

1082
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:40,067
Come on.

1083
01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:15,302
Where do we go now?

1084
01:23:15,703 --> 01:23:16,604
Yeah.

1085
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:19,573
There!

1086
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:32,353
Wait! We'd better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1087
01:23:32,419 --> 01:23:33,420
It's us!

1088
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:35,656
Yes, it's me!

1089
01:23:35,923 --> 01:23:37,391
She's locked me in!

1090
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:40,494
It's her. We gotta get her out!
Open the door!

1091
01:23:40,561 --> 01:23:42,530
Hurry! Please, hurry!

1092
01:23:42,663 --> 01:23:44,598
The hourglass is almost empty!

1093
01:23:44,665 --> 01:23:45,766
Stand back!

1094
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:03,784
Toto! Toto!

1095
01:24:03,851 --> 01:24:05,820
-Did they hurt you?
-I knew you'd come!

1096
01:24:05,886 --> 01:24:07,154
I knew you would!

1097
01:24:07,221 --> 01:24:09,423
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

1098
01:24:21,368 --> 01:24:22,937
Going so soon?

1099
01:24:23,304 --> 01:24:25,005
I wouldn't hear of it.

1100
01:24:25,339 --> 01:24:29,109
Why, my little party's just beginning.

1101
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:31,512
Trapped! Trapped like mice, rats!

1102
01:24:40,521 --> 01:24:43,123
That's right. Don't hurt them right away.

1103
01:24:43,624 --> 01:24:46,260
We'll let them think about it a little first.

1104
01:24:57,171 --> 01:24:59,607
Seize them! Stop them, you fools!

1105
01:24:59,673 --> 01:25:02,843
Stop them! Seize them! Seize them!

1106
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,855
There they go! Now we've got them!

1107
01:25:14,922 --> 01:25:17,324
Half you go this way, half you go that way!

1108
01:25:17,391 --> 01:25:18,659
Hurry! Hurry!

1109
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:27,835
Where do we go now?

1110
01:25:28,536 --> 01:25:30,204
This way, come on!

1111
01:25:37,845 --> 01:25:38,979
Back! Back!

1112
01:25:57,698 --> 01:25:58,699
Well!

1113
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:02,303
Ring around the rosie!
A pocket full of spears!

1114
01:26:02,403 --> 01:26:04,939
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?

1115
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:09,376
The last to go will see
the first three go before her!

1116
01:26:10,945 --> 01:26:12,847
And her mangy little dog, too!

1117
01:26:21,055 --> 01:26:23,224
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

1118
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:25,392
No! No! No!

1119
01:26:25,559 --> 01:26:28,596
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!

1120
01:26:29,063 --> 01:26:30,731
Don't throw that water!

1121
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,503
You cursed brat! Look what you've done!

1122
01:26:35,603 --> 01:26:37,705
I'm melting! Melting!

1123
01:26:38,772 --> 01:26:40,908
What a world! What a world!

1124
01:26:40,975 --> 01:26:45,813
Who would have thought a good little girl
could destroy my beautiful wickedness?

1125
01:26:46,647 --> 01:26:48,782
Look out! Look out!

1126
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:50,518
I'm going.

1127
01:27:07,234 --> 01:27:09,370
She's dead. You've killed her.

1128
01:27:09,436 --> 01:27:12,306
I didn't mean to kill her, really I didn't.

1129
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:15,776
It's just that he was on fire!

1130
01:27:15,843 --> 01:27:18,412
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1131
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:21,982
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1132
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:23,951
The broom!

1133
01:27:24,018 --> 01:27:25,052
May we have it?

1134
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:27,054
Please. And take it with you.

1135
01:27:27,221 --> 01:27:28,622
Thank you so much!

1136
01:27:29,089 --> 01:27:32,293
Now we can go back to the Wizard
and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!

1137
01:27:32,359 --> 01:27:33,994
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1138
01:27:34,061 --> 01:27:36,197
Can I believe my eyes?

1139
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:38,599
Why have you come back?

1140
01:27:40,701 --> 01:27:43,637
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.

1141
01:27:43,938 --> 01:27:47,374
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

1142
01:27:47,441 --> 01:27:48,776
We melted her.

1143
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:52,480
You liquidated her, eh?

1144
01:27:53,013 --> 01:27:54,415
Very resourceful!

1145
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:59,119
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep
your promise to us, if you please, sir.

1146
01:27:59,253 --> 01:28:02,056
Not so fast! Not so fast!

1147
01:28:02,756 --> 01:28:05,459
I'll have to give the matter a little thought!

1148
01:28:05,559 --> 01:28:08,062
Go away, and come back tomorrow!

1149
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:09,530
Tomorrow?

1150
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:12,233
But I want to go home now!

1151
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,969
You've had plenty of time already!

1152
01:28:15,035 --> 01:28:15,936
Yeah!

1153
01:28:16,003 --> 01:28:19,540
Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Oz!

1154
01:28:20,374 --> 01:28:22,443
I said, "Come back tomorrow!"

1155
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:23,644
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises!

1156
01:28:23,644 --> 01:28:26,680
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises!

1157
01:28:26,747 --> 01:28:30,050
Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?

1158
01:28:30,684 --> 01:28:32,920
You ungrateful creatures!

1159
01:28:33,187 --> 01:28:36,991
Think yourselves lucky
that I'm giving you audience tomorrow...

1160
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:39,760
...instead of20 years from now!

1161
01:28:41,795 --> 01:28:44,064
The great Oz has spoken!

1162
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:49,570
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.

1163
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:53,440
The great Oz has spoken!

1164
01:28:53,874 --> 01:28:55,075
Who are you?

1165
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:58,179
I am the great and powerful...

1166
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:00,014
...Wizard of Oz.

1167
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,115
You are?

1168
01:29:01,782 --> 01:29:03,250
I don't believe you!

1169
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:06,754
No, I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other wizard except me.

1170
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:08,055
You humbug!

1171
01:29:08,122 --> 01:29:09,089
Yeah!

1172
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:12,660
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.

1173
01:29:14,094 --> 01:29:15,863
You're a very bad man!

1174
01:29:17,097 --> 01:29:19,533
No, my dear. I'm a very good man.

1175
01:29:19,633 --> 01:29:22,570
I'm just a very bad wizard.

1176
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:25,506
What about the heart
that you promised Tin Man?

1177
01:29:25,606 --> 01:29:27,942
And the courage
that you promised Cowardly Lion?

1178
01:29:28,008 --> 01:29:29,510
And Scarecrow's brain?

1179
01:29:29,577 --> 01:29:33,747
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1180
01:29:33,914 --> 01:29:36,951
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1181
01:29:37,017 --> 01:29:40,054
...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!

1182
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:42,690
Back where I come from
we have universities...

1183
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:46,360
...seats of great learning, where men go
to become great thinkers.

1184
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,896
When they come out,
they think deep thoughts...

1185
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:50,898
...with no more brains than you have.

1186
01:29:50,965 --> 01:29:54,368
But they have one thing you haven't got:
A diploma!

1187
01:29:54,835 --> 01:29:59,006
Therefore, by virtue of the authority
vested in me...

1188
01:29:59,206 --> 01:30:02,910
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

1189
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:05,479
...I hereby confer upon you...

1190
01:30:05,579 --> 01:30:08,082
...the honorary degree of Th.D.

1191
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:10,251
"Th.D."?

1192
01:30:10,317 --> 01:30:13,020
Yeah, that's "Doctor of Thinkology."

1193
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:16,590
"The sum of the square roots
of any two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1194
01:30:16,657 --> 01:30:19,460
"...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side."

1195
01:30:20,694 --> 01:30:21,962
Joy! Rapture!

1196
01:30:22,563 --> 01:30:23,931
I've got a brain!

1197
01:30:24,165 --> 01:30:25,900
How can I ever thank you enough?

1198
01:30:25,966 --> 01:30:30,738
Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend,
you are a victim of disorganized thinking.

1199
01:30:30,838 --> 01:30:32,907
You're under the unfortunate delusion...

1200
01:30:32,973 --> 01:30:36,210
...that simply because you run away
from danger you have no courage.

1201
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:38,946
You are confusing courage with wisdom.

1202
01:30:39,013 --> 01:30:42,783
Back where I come from we have men
who are called heroes.

1203
01:30:43,184 --> 01:30:46,220
Once a year they take their fortitude
out of mothballs...

1204
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:48,856
...and parade it down the main street
of the city.

1205
01:30:48,923 --> 01:30:51,258
And they have no more courage
than you have.

1206
01:30:51,325 --> 01:30:54,228
But they have one thing
that you haven't got:

1207
01:30:54,728 --> 01:30:55,729
A medal!

1208
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:59,834
Therefore, for meritorious conduct...

1209
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:04,905
...extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

1210
01:31:05,005 --> 01:31:07,408
...I award you the Triple Cross.

1211
01:31:08,108 --> 01:31:11,245
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage!

1212
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:17,585
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless!

1213
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:22,490
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart!

1214
01:31:22,756 --> 01:31:25,626
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1215
01:31:25,693 --> 01:31:29,964
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

1216
01:31:30,764 --> 01:31:32,500
But I still want one.

1217
01:31:33,133 --> 01:31:37,204
Back where I come from there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1218
01:31:37,404 --> 01:31:39,406
They are called...

1219
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:44,545
...good-deed-doers and their hearts are
no bigger than yours.

1220
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:48,282
But they have one thing you haven't got:
A testimonial!

1221
01:31:48,682 --> 01:31:51,852
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

1222
01:31:51,919 --> 01:31:54,889
...I take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

1223
01:31:54,955 --> 01:31:58,259
...with a small token of our esteem
and affection.

1224
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:01,095
And remember, my sentimental friend...

1225
01:32:01,695 --> 01:32:04,665
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

1226
01:32:05,132 --> 01:32:07,668
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

1227
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:13,407
It ticks! Listen!

1228
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:15,376
Look, it ticks!

1229
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:18,112
Read what my medal says.

1230
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:19,013
"Courage"!

1231
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:21,482
Ain't it the truth? Ain't it the truth?

1232
01:32:21,882 --> 01:32:23,484
They're all wonderful.

1233
01:32:24,785 --> 01:32:27,154
-What about Dorothy?
-Yes, how about Dorothy?

1234
01:32:27,988 --> 01:32:30,057
-Dorothy next!
-Yes, Dorothy.

1235
01:32:30,124 --> 01:32:33,093
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1236
01:32:33,861 --> 01:32:36,130
You force me into a cataclysmic decision.

1237
01:32:36,197 --> 01:32:40,401
The only way to get Dorothy back to
Kansas is for me to take her there myself!

1238
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:43,571
Will you? Could you?

1239
01:32:45,739 --> 01:32:48,042
Are you a clever enough wizard
to manage it?

1240
01:32:48,108 --> 01:32:52,112
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...

1241
01:32:52,279 --> 01:32:55,249
...born and bred in the heart
of the western wilderness...

1242
01:32:55,316 --> 01:32:57,351
...premier balloonist par excellence...

1243
01:32:57,418 --> 01:33:00,654
...for the Miracle Wonderland
Carnival Company. Until one day...

1244
01:33:00,721 --> 01:33:04,425
...while performing spectacular feats
of stratospheric skill...

1245
01:33:04,558 --> 01:33:09,363
...never before attempted by civilized man,
an unfortunate phenomenon occurred.

1246
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:11,765
The balloon failed to return to the fair.

1247
01:33:11,832 --> 01:33:12,633
It did?

1248
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,034
Weren't you frightened?

1249
01:33:14,101 --> 01:33:17,805
Frightened? You are talking to a man
who has laughed in the face of death...

1250
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:21,041
...sneered at doom
and chuckled at catastrophe.

1251
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,576
I was petrified.

1252
01:33:22,743 --> 01:33:25,946
Then suddenly the wind changed
and the balloon floated down...

1253
01:33:26,013 --> 01:33:30,518
...into the heart of this noble city
where I was instantly acclaimed Oz...

1254
01:33:30,618 --> 01:33:32,753
...the First Wizard Deluxe!

1255
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:36,290
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...

1256
01:33:36,524 --> 01:33:40,294
...retaining my balloon against the advent
of a quick getaway.

1257
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:44,999
And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy,
you and I will return...

1258
01:33:45,065 --> 01:33:47,501
...to the land of "e pluribus unum"!

1259
01:34:01,949 --> 01:34:05,753
This is positively the finest exhibition
ever to be shown.

1260
01:34:06,587 --> 01:34:08,823
Yes, well, be that as it may...

1261
01:34:08,889 --> 01:34:12,593
...l, your Wizard per ardua et alta...

1262
01:34:12,793 --> 01:34:17,998
...am about to embark upon a hazardous
and technically unexplainable journey...

1263
01:34:18,332 --> 01:34:20,868
...into the outer stratosphere!

1264
01:34:24,672 --> 01:34:29,910
To confer, converse and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

1265
01:34:30,344 --> 01:34:33,914
And I hereby decree that until what time...

1266
01:34:34,081 --> 01:34:37,852
...if any, that I return, the Scarecrow...

1267
01:34:38,152 --> 01:34:43,123
...by virtue of his highly superior brains,
shall rule in my stead...

1268
01:34:43,491 --> 01:34:47,928
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

1269
01:34:48,295 --> 01:34:51,866
...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage!

1270
01:34:52,299 --> 01:34:54,802
Obey them as you would me.

1271
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:56,103
Thank you.

1272
01:34:58,739 --> 01:34:59,707
Toto!

1273
01:34:59,773 --> 01:35:01,142
Come back! Toto!

1274
01:35:01,842 --> 01:35:04,078
Don't go without me! I'll be right back!

1275
01:35:04,145 --> 01:35:05,546
Stop that dog!

1276
01:35:05,613 --> 01:35:10,050
This is highly irregular procedure!
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1277
01:35:10,117 --> 01:35:11,418
Ruined my exit!

1278
01:35:12,052 --> 01:35:13,721
Come back! Come back!

1279
01:35:13,854 --> 01:35:16,257
Don't go without me! Please, come back!

1280
01:35:16,524 --> 01:35:19,326
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!

1281
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,228
Goodbye, folks!

1282
01:35:21,495 --> 01:35:22,563
Goodbye!

1283
01:35:27,034 --> 01:35:28,569
Now I'll never get home!

1284
01:35:30,704 --> 01:35:32,540
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1285
01:35:33,107 --> 01:35:34,475
We all love you.

1286
01:35:35,075 --> 01:35:37,044
We don't want you to go.

1287
01:35:37,645 --> 01:35:39,413
That's very kind of you...

1288
01:35:40,114 --> 01:35:42,449
...but this could never be like Kansas.

1289
01:35:43,484 --> 01:35:47,188
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1290
01:35:47,988 --> 01:35:50,224
Scarecrow, what am I going to do?

1291
01:35:52,493 --> 01:35:53,460
Look!

1292
01:35:54,195 --> 01:35:56,230
Here's someone who can help you!

1293
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:33,968
-Will you help me? Can you help me?
-You don't need to be helped any longer.

1294
01:36:34,034 --> 01:36:37,037
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1295
01:36:37,238 --> 01:36:38,305
I have?

1296
01:36:38,372 --> 01:36:40,107
Why didn't you tell her before?

1297
01:36:40,174 --> 01:36:44,044
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1298
01:36:44,278 --> 01:36:46,347
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1299
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:55,156
I think that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1300
01:36:56,257 --> 01:37:00,361
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1301
01:37:01,061 --> 01:37:03,798
...I won't look any further
than my own backyard...

1302
01:37:04,632 --> 01:37:06,634
...because if it isn't there...

1303
01:37:07,134 --> 01:37:09,537
...I never really lost it to begin with.

1304
01:37:10,404 --> 01:37:11,639
Is that right?

1305
01:37:12,006 --> 01:37:13,607
That's all it is!

1306
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:16,911
But that's so easy!
I should have thought of it for you.

1307
01:37:16,977 --> 01:37:20,815
-I should have felt it in my heart.
-No. She had to find it out for herself.

1308
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:24,151
Now those magic slippers
will take you home in two seconds!

1309
01:37:24,285 --> 01:37:26,253
-Toto, too?
-Toto, too.

1310
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:29,056
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

1311
01:37:29,456 --> 01:37:32,860
Oh, dear, that's too wonderful to be true!

1312
01:37:34,829 --> 01:37:38,499
It's going to be so hard to say goodbye.

1313
01:37:39,633 --> 01:37:41,101
I love you all, too.

1314
01:37:44,205 --> 01:37:45,573
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1315
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:48,242
Don't cry.

1316
01:37:48,976 --> 01:37:50,744
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1317
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,715
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1318
01:37:57,351 --> 01:37:58,352
Goodbye.

1319
01:37:58,452 --> 01:38:01,622
Now I know I've got a heart
'cause it's breaking.

1320
01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:07,027
Goodbye, Lion.

1321
01:38:07,394 --> 01:38:09,296
You know, I know it isn't right...

1322
01:38:09,363 --> 01:38:12,967
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1323
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,302
...before you found your courage.

1324
01:38:15,903 --> 01:38:19,206
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1325
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:27,248
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1326
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,121
Are you ready now?

1327
01:38:34,288 --> 01:38:35,322
Yes.

1328
01:38:37,458 --> 01:38:38,859
Say goodbye, Toto.

1329
01:38:42,296 --> 01:38:43,998
Yes, I'm ready now.

1330
01:38:44,265 --> 01:38:48,602
Then close your eyes and tap your heels
together three times.

1331
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:52,973
And think to yourself:

1332
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:58,979
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home."

1333
01:39:00,281 --> 01:39:02,783
There's no place like home.

1334
01:39:03,851 --> 01:39:06,353
There's no place like home.

1335
01:39:07,288 --> 01:39:09,790
There's no place like home.

1336
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:13,327
There's no place like home.

1337
01:39:14,361 --> 01:39:16,363
There's no place like home.

1338
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,102
There's no place like home.

1339
01:39:23,304 --> 01:39:25,306
There's no place like home.

1340
01:39:27,575 --> 01:39:28,609
Wake up, honey.

1341
01:39:28,676 --> 01:39:30,678
There's no place like home.

1342
01:39:31,579 --> 01:39:33,581
There's no place like home.

1343
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,651
There's no place....

1344
01:39:40,654 --> 01:39:43,858
Dorothy! Dorothy, dear.
It's Aunt Em, darling.

1345
01:39:44,258 --> 01:39:46,393
Auntie Em, it's you!

1346
01:39:46,994 --> 01:39:49,096
Hello, there! Anybody home?

1347
01:39:49,196 --> 01:39:53,534
I just dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big....

1348
01:39:54,168 --> 01:39:56,070
Well, she seems all right now!

1349
01:39:56,303 --> 01:40:00,207
She got quite a bump on the head.
We thought for a minute she'd leave us.

1350
01:40:00,274 --> 01:40:03,110
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry.
That's just the trouble.

1351
01:40:03,177 --> 01:40:05,379
And I tried to get back for days and days.

1352
01:40:05,446 --> 01:40:09,049
There, there, lie quiet now.
You just had a bad dream.

1353
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:10,384
Sure.

1354
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:13,654
Remember me, your old pal, Hunk?

1355
01:40:14,955 --> 01:40:16,991
And me, Hickory?

1356
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:19,660
You couldn't forget my face, could you?

1357
01:40:19,727 --> 01:40:23,030
No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.

1358
01:40:23,531 --> 01:40:27,134
And you, and you, and you,
and you were there.

1359
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:31,472
But you couldn't have been, could you?

1360
01:40:31,539 --> 01:40:33,674
We dream lots of silly things when we--

1361
01:40:33,741 --> 01:40:37,211
No, Aunt Em, this was a real,
truly live place.

1362
01:40:37,978 --> 01:40:40,881
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1363
01:40:40,948 --> 01:40:44,084
...but most of it was beautiful.
But just the same...

1364
01:40:44,218 --> 01:40:47,388
...all I kept saying to everybody was,
"I want to go home! "

1365
01:40:47,454 --> 01:40:49,323
And they sent me home.

1366
01:40:51,292 --> 01:40:53,327
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1367
01:40:53,427 --> 01:40:55,396
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1368
01:40:55,463 --> 01:40:57,698
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1369
01:40:58,032 --> 01:40:59,033
Home!

1370
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,503
And this is my room, and you're all here!

1371
01:41:03,037 --> 01:41:07,708
And I'm not going to leave here ever,
ever again, because I love you all!

1372
01:41:09,977 --> 01:41:13,714
Auntie Em, there's no place like home!
