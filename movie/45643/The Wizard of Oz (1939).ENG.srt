1
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,001
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

2
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,670
Did she hurt you?

3
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,630
She tried to, didn't she?

4
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,092
Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry
and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.

5
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,436
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

6
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,064
Just listen to what Miss Gulch
did to Toto

7
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,066
Dorothy, please. We're counting.

8
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,986
-But she hit him
-Don't bother us now, honey.

9
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,991
The incubator's gone bad and
we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

10
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,909
Oh, that poor little thing.

11
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,787
But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

12
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,416
...because she says he chases
her nasty old cat every day!

13
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,751
seventy. Dorothy, please!

14
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,088
But he doesn't do it every day!
Just once or twice a week.

15
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,132
He can't catch her old cat anyway.

16
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,553
-And now she says she's gonna
-Dorothy. Dorothy, we're busy.

17
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,307
Oh, all right.

18
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,645
How's she coming?
Take it easy.

19
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,147
Ow!

20
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,732
You got my finger!

21
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,901
Get your finger out of the way.

22
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,029
There you are.
Right on my finger!

23
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,655
Lucky it wasn't your head.

24
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:22,534
Zeke, what am I gonna do about
Miss Gulch? Just because Toto

25
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,204
Listen, honey,
I got them hogs to get in.

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,499
Dorothy, you ain't using your head.
You'd think you didn't have any brains.

27
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,628
-I have so got brains.
-Well, why don't you use them?

28
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,796
Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

29
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,842
Then Toto won't get in her garden,
and you won't get in no trouble, see?

30
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,929
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen,
that's all.

31
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,390
Well, your head ain't made of straw,
you know.

32
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,730
Say, get in there before I make
a dime bank out of you.

33
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,026
Listen, kid...

34
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:00,322
...are you gonna let that old Gulch
heifer try and buffalo you?

35
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,742
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage.

36
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,410
I'm not afraid of her.

37
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,455
Next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

38
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,125
-That's what I'd do.
-Oh! Oh!

39
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,086
Oh! Zeke!

40
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,214
Help! Help me, Zeke!
Get me out of here!

41
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,132
Help!

42
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,884
Oh! Oh!

43
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,346
Are you all right, Dorothy?
-Yes, I'm all right.

44
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,516
I fell in, and Zeke

45
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,853
Why, Zeke, you're just
as scared as I am.

46
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,023
You gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of you?

47
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,233
Look at you

48
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,486
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

49
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,656
I know three farm hands
that'll be out of a job.

50
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,865
Dorothy was

51
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,201
I saw you tinkering
with that contraption.

52
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,996
-You and Hunk get back to that wagon.
All right.

53
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,581
But someday they'll erect
a statue to me

54
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,418
Well, don't start posing for it now.

55
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,004
Can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers.

56
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,298
Gosh, Mrs. Gale.
Just fried.

57
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,383
You see, Dorothy toppled into the

58
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,760
It's no place for Dorothy
around a pigsty!

59
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,638
Feed those hogs before they
worry themselves into anemia!

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,140
-Yes.
-Auntie Em...

61
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,601
...you know what Miss Gulch
said she was going to do to Toto?

62
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,438
-She said she'd
Stop imagining things.

63
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,567
You always get in a fret over nothing.
You just help us out today...

64
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,487
...and find yourself a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

65
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,617
Someplace where there
isn't any trouble.

66
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,538
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

67
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,249
There must be.

68
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,130
It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,301
It's far, far away.

70
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,928
Behind the moon...

71
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,222
...beyond the rain....

72
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:55,896
Somewhere over the rainbow

73
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:01,109
Way up high

74
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:06,114
There's a land that I heard of

75
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:11,411
Once in a lullaby

76
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:17,793
Somewhere over the rainbow

77
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,798
Skies are blue

78
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:28,428
And the dreams that you dare to dream

79
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,849
Really do come true

80
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,437
Someday I'll wish upon a star

81
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:44,486
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me

82
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,532
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

83
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,493
Away above the chimney tops

84
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,663
That's where you'll...

85
00:06:54,831 --> 00:07:00,752
...find me

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:07,134
Somewhere over the rainbow

87
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:12,556
Bluebirds fly

88
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:18,812
Birds fly over the rainbow

89
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,815
Why then...

90
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:28,780
...oh, why can't I?

91
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,169
If happy little bluebirds fly

92
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,464
Beyond the rainbow

93
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,717
Why, oh, why...

94
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:55,557
...can't I?

95
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,457
Mr. Gale.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

96
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,585
I want to see you and your wife
about Dorothy.

97
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,046
-What has Dorothy done?
-What's she done?

98
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,548
I'm all but lame from
the bite on my leg!

99
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,384
-You mean, she bit you?
-No, her dog!

100
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,263
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?

101
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,474
No.

102
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,937
That dog's a menace. I'm taking him
to make sure he's destroyed.

103
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,356
Destroyed! Toto?

104
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,399
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

105
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,653
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

106
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,655
Of course we won't.

107
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,240
Uh, will we, Em?

108
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,908
Please, Aunt Em!

109
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,536
Toto didn't know he was
doing anything wrong.

110
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:02,249
I'm the one that ought to be punished.
Send me to bed without supper.

111
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,418
Hand over that dog or I'll bring
a suit that'll take your farm!

112
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,796
The law protects folks
against dogs that bite!

113
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,590
How about if she keeps him tied up?
He's gentle.

114
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,469
-With gentle people, that is.
-That's for the sheriff to decide.

115
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:19,140
This order allows me to take him.
Unless you wanna go against the law.

116
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,811
Hm. Yes.

117
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,314
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go.

118
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,941
-Now you're seeing reason.
-No.

119
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,069
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

120
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,405
No, No! I won't let you take him!

121
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,992
-You go away or I'll bite you myself!
Dorothy!

122
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,288
You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry,
Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto.

123
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,747
I've got an order!

124
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,291
-Let me have him!
-Please stop!

125
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,959
Put him in the basket, Henry.

126
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,169
-The idea!
-Don't, Uncle Henry.

127
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,507
Oh, Toto!

128
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,770
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county...

129
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,231
...doesn't mean you can
run the rest of us!

130
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,610
For 23 years I've been dying
to tell you what I thought of you!

131
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,861
And now

132
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,531
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!

133
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,266
Toto, darling!

134
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,479
Oh, I got you back!
You came back!

135
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,315
I'm so glad!

136
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,571
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

137
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,532
We've got to get away!

138
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,826
We've got to run away!

139
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,072
Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?

140
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,033
And who might you be?

141
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,910
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

142
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,913
Let's see. You're

143
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,707
You're traveling in disguise.

144
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,584
No, that's not right. You're

145
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,294
You're going on a visit.

146
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,547
No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we

147
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,216
You're You're running away.

148
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,968
How did you guess?

149
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,554
Professor Marvel never guesses,
he knows.

150
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,725
Now, why are you running away?
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

151
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,270
They They don't understand you
at home. They don't appreciate you.

152
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,566
You want to see other lands.
Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.

153
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,569
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

154
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,990
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

155
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,993
Oh, he's perfectly welcome.

156
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,954
As one dog to another, huh?

157
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,165
Now, let's see, where were we?

158
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:34,210
Why can't we go with you and
see all the crowned heads of Europe?

159
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,297
Do you know any?
Oh, you mean the thing. Yes.

160
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:42,135
Well, uh, I never do anything without
consulting my crystal first.

161
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,598
Let's go inside here. We'll
Just come along. I'll show you.

162
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,352
That's right. Here.
Sit right down here. That's it.

163
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,524
This is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal...

164
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:01,571
...used by the priests of Isis and
Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...

165
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:06,785
...in which Cleopatra saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

166
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,913
And so on, and so on. Now...

167
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,291
...you'd better close your eyes,
my child, for a moment...

168
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,630
...in order to be better in tuned
with the Infinite.

169
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,177
We can't do these things without
reaching out into the Infinite.

170
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,013
Yes, that's all right.
Now you can open them.

171
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,225
We'll gaze into the crystal.

172
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,810
Ah.

173
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,730
What's this I see?
A house with a picket fence...

174
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,067
...and a barn with a weathervane...

175
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,444
...of a running horse.

176
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,696
-That's our farm!
-Yes.

177
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,449
Yes. There's a woman.

178
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:51,454
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.
Her face is careworn.

179
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,081
That's Aunt Em.

180
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,291
Yes. Her name is Emily.

181
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,710
That's right. What's she doing?

182
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,421
Well, I can't quite see.

183
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,633
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.

184
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,803
Someone has just about
broken her heart.

185
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,012
Me?

186
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,182
Well, it's It's someone
she loves very much.

187
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,434
Someone she's been very kind to.

188
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,854
Someone she's taken care of
in sickness.

189
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,316
I had the measles once, and she stayed
right by me every minute.

190
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,609
Uh-huh.

191
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,611
What's she doing now?

192
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,281
Yes, she's What's this?

193
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,492
Why, she's putting her hand
on her heart!

194
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,954
-She's dropping down on the bed.
-Oh, no, no!

195
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,749
Well, that's all.
The crystal's gone dark.

196
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,752
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

197
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,756
-Oh, I've gotta go home right away.
-I thought you were going with me.

198
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,217
No, I have to get to her right away!

199
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,511
Come on, Toto! Come on!

200
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,017
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot!

201
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,105
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
A storm's blowing up.

202
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,525
A whopper, to speak in
the vernacular of the peasantry.

203
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,904
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.

204
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,289
Get them horses loose!

205
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,584
Where's Hickory? Hickory?

206
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,628
Doggone it!

207
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,174
It's a twister! It's a twister!

208
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,807
Dorothy!

209
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,813
Dorothy!

210
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,701
Everybody in the storm cellar!

211
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,255
Henry, I can't find Dorothy!
She's out in the storm!

212
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,341
We can't look for her now.

213
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,177
Come on, get in the cellar!
Hurry up!

214
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,578
Auntie Em!

215
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,206
Auntie Em?

216
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,710
Auntie Em!

217
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,346
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

218
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,732
Auntie Em!

219
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,552
We must be up inside the cyclone!

220
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,558
Oh! Miss Gulch!

221
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,140
Oh!

222
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,957
Toto...

223
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,877
...I have a feeling we're not
in Kansas anymore.

224
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,390
We must be over the rainbow!

225
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,797
Now I know we're not in Kansas.

226
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,678
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

227
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,972
Who, me?

228
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,224
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

229
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,311
-I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
-Oh.

230
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,271
Well, is that the witch?

231
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,607
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

232
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,028
I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins
called me because a new witch...

233
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,031
...just dropped a house on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

234
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,616
And there's the house,
and here you are...

235
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,828
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

236
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:17,126
What the Munchkins want to know is,
are you a good witch or a bad witch?

237
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,879
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.

238
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,839
Witches are old and ugly.

239
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,468
What was that?

240
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,221
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because I am a witch.

241
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

242
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,684
You are?

243
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,311
Oh, I beg your pardon!

244
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,731
But I've never heard
of a beautiful witch before.

245
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,359
Only bad witches are ugly.

246
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,028
The Munchkins are happy
because you freed them...

247
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,032
-...from the Wicked Witch of the East.
-But if you please, what are Munchkins?

248
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,994
The little people who live here.
It's Munchkinland...

249
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,747
...and you are their national heroine,
my dear.

250
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,959
It's all right.
You may all come out and thank her.

251
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:03,381
Come out, come out
Wherever you are

252
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:09,762
And meet the young lady
Who fell from a star

253
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,852
She fell from the sky
She fell very far

254
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,024
And Kansas, she says
Is the name of the star

255
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,819
Kansas, she says

256
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,570
Is the name of the star

257
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,867
She brings you good news

258
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,370
Or haven't you heard?

259
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,706
When she fell out of Kansas

260
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,752
A miracle occurred

261
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,924
It really was no miracle
What happened was just this

262
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,386
The wind began to switch
The house to pitch

263
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,806
And suddenly the hinges
Started to unhitch

264
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,309
Just then the Witch
To satisfy an itch

265
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,813
Went flying on her broomstick
Thumbing for a hitch

266
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,275
And oh, what happened then was rich

267
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,444
The house began to pitch

268
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,028
The kitchen took a slitch

269
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,865
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

270
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:16,287
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

271
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,331
The house began to pitch
The kitchen took a slitch

272
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,418
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch

273
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:27,256
Which was not a healthy situation
For the Wicked Witch

274
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:31,677
Who began to twitch
And was reduced to just a stitch

275
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:36,015
Of what was once the Wicked Witch

276
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,148
We thank you very sweetly

277
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,567
For doing it so neatly

278
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,278
You've killed her so completely

279
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,865
That we thank you very sweetly

280
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:58,579
Let the joyous news be spread!
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

281
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,001
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead

282
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,669
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

283
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,381
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

284
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,219
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

285
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,722
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead

286
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,559
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

287
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,563
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

288
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:28,150
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

289
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,488
Let them know
The Wicked Witch is dead

290
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,011
As mayor of the Munchkin City

291
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,515
In the county of the Land of Oz

292
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,102
I welcome you most regally

293
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,564
But we've got to verify it legally

294
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,232
-To see
-To see?

295
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
-If she
-If she?

296
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,944
Is morally, ethically

297
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,197
-Spiritually, physically
-Positively, absolutely

298
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:20,953
Undeniably and reliably dead

299
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,379
As coroner I must aver

300
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,340
I thoroughly examined her

301
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,385
And she's not only merely dead

302
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,972
She's really most sincerely dead

303
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,393
Then this is a Day of Independence...

304
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,271
...for all the Munchkins
and their descendants.

305
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,480
If any!

306
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:54,111
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!

307
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,447
Ding-Dong! The Witch is dead

308
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,115
Which old witch? The Wicked Witch

309
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,452
Ding-Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead

310
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,955
Wake up, you sleepyhead
Rub your eyes, get out of bed

311
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,417
Wake up
The Wicked Witch is dead

312
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,920
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below

313
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,841
Yo-ho! Let's open up and sing
And ring the bells out

314
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,470
Ding-Dong! The merry-o
Sing it high, sing it low

315
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,349
Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

316
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,501
We represent the Lullaby League

317
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,712
The Lullaby League
The Lullaby League

318
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,509
And in the name of the Lullaby League

319
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,888
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

320
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,275
We represent the Lollipop Guild

321
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,737
The Lollipop Guild
The Lollipop Guild

322
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:23,033
And in the name of the Lollipop Guild

323
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:28,330
We wish to welcome you
To Munchkinland

324
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,959
We welcome you to Munchkinland

325
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,337
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

326
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,882
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

327
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,135
From now on you'll be history

328
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,595
-You'll be his
-You'll be history

329
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:47,766
And we will glorify your name

330
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,393
-You will be a bust
-Be a bust

331
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,813
-Be a bust
-In the hall of fame

332
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,815
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

333
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,984
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

334
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,111
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

335
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,321
Tra-la-la-la-la
La-la

336
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,574
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la

337
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,618
Tra-la-la-la-la
La

338
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,094
I thought you said she was dead.

339
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,764
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

340
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,893
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

341
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,897
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?

342
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,523
Was it you?

343
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,736
No. No, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

344
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,323
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents too!

345
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,951
-Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?
-The slippers. Yes!

346
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,913
The slippers!

347
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,670
They're gone!

348
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,298
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?

349
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,175
Give them back to me or I'll

350
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,887
It's too late! There they are,
and there they'll stay!

351
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,353
Give me back my slippers!
Only I know how to use them.

352
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,065
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me. Give them back!

353
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,109
Keep tight inside of them.
Their magic must be powerful...

354
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,237
...or she wouldn't want them so badly.

355
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,864
Stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well!

356
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,242
Oh, rubbish!
You have no power here.

357
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,537
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you too.

358
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,665
Very well. I'll bide my time.

359
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:39,795
And as for you, it's true I can't
attend to you here and now as I'd like.

360
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,381
But just try to stay out of my way!

361
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,674
Just try!

362
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,759
I'll get you, my pretty...

363
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,178
...and your little dog too!

364
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,316
It's all right. You can get up.
She's gone!

365
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,737
It's all right. You can all get up.

366
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,573
Oh! What a smell of sulfur!

367
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,993
I'm afraid you've made an enemy
of the Wicked Witch.

368
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,414
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

369
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,709
Oh, I'd give anything
to get out of Oz altogether.

370
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,921
But which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.

371
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,133
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...

372
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,928
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.

373
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,181
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?

374
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,893
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.

375
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,937
He lives in the Emerald City,
a long journey from here.

376
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,773
Did you bring your broomstick
with you?

377
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,611
-No, I'm afraid I didn't.
-Well, then, you'll have to walk.

378
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,156
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkinland.

379
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,785
And remember, never let those ruby
slippers off your feet for a moment...

380
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,789
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

381
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,084
But how do I start for Emerald City?

382
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,337
It's always best
to start at the beginning.

383
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,758
And all you do is
follow the Yellow Brick Road.

384
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:21,647
-But what happens if I
-Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

385
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,358
Goodbye!

386
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,289
My!

387
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,250
People come and go so quickly here!

388
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,422
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

389
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,927
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

390
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,180
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

391
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,141
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

392
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,143
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

393
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,145
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

394
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,231
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

395
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,649
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

396
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,528
Follow, follow, follow, follow
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

397
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,199
Follow the Yellow Brick

398
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,618
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

399
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,958
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

400
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,503
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

401
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,965
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

402
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,468
Because, because, because
Because, because

403
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,263
Because of the wonderful things he does

404
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,977
You're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

405
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,747
Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

406
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,832
Follow the Yellow...?

407
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,460
Now which way do we go?

408
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,755
Pardon me!
That way is a very nice way.

409
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,800
Who said that?

410
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,514
Don't be silly, Toto.

411
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:23,268
-Scarecrows don't talk.
-It's pleasant down that way too.

412
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,315
That's funny.
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

413
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,902
Of course, people do go both ways.

414
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,909
Why, you did say something,
didn't you?

415
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,166
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

416
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,294
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.

417
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,213
I haven't got a brain.

418
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,423
Only straw.

419
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,259
How can you talk if you
haven't got a brain?

420
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,011
I don't know.

421
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,973
But some people without brains
do a lot of talking, don't they?

422
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,893
Yes, I guess you're right.

423
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,022
Well, we haven't really
met properly, have we?

424
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,149
Why, no.

425
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,069
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

426
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,447
-Very well, thank you.
-Oh, I'm not feeling at all well.

427
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:22,619
It's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

428
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,915
Oh, dear. That must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

429
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,626
Down? No, you see, I'm
Well, I'm

430
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,878
Oh, well, here. Let me help you.

431
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,048
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Very kind.

432
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,301
Oh, dear. I don't see....

433
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:42,055
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things...

434
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,685
...but if you'll just bend the nail down,
maybe I'll slip off and

435
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,770
Oh, yes!

436
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,188
Whoops!

437
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,275
-There goes some of me again!
-Does it hurt you?

438
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:57,696
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

439
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,990
My! It's good to be free!

440
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,535
Did I scare you?

441
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,997
No, no. I just thought
you hurt yourself.

442
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,250
-But I didn't scare you?
-No, of course not.

443
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,960
I didn't think so.

444
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,671
Boo! Scat! Boo!

445
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,303
You see? I can't even scare a crow.

446
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,849
They come from miles around just to eat
in my field and laugh in my face.

447
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,519
Oh, I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain!

448
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,814
Well, what would you do
with a brain if you had one?

449
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,066
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could

450
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,946
I could while away the hours
conferring with the flowers

451
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,699
Consulting with the rain

452
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,120
And my head I'd be scratchin'
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'

453
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,956
If I only had a brain

454
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,920
I'd unravel every riddle
For any individ'le

455
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,547
In trouble or in pain

456
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:02,219
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'
You could be another Lincoln

457
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,972
If you only had a brain

458
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,018
Oh, I could tell you why

459
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,521
The ocean's near the shore

460
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,025
I could think of things
I never thunk before

461
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,946
And then I'd sit
And think some more

462
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,908
I would not be just a nothin'
My head all full of stuffin'

463
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,036
My heart all full of pain

464
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,123
I would dance and be merry
Life would be a ding-a-derry

465
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,751
If I only had a brain

466
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,586
Whoa!

467
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,798
Wonderful!

468
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,801
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas
could do that...

469
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,971
-...the crows would be scared to pieces!
-They would?

470
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,473
-Where's Kansas?
-That's where I live.

471
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,601
I wanna get back there so badly,
I'm going to Emerald City...

472
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,853
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

473
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,439
-You're going to see a wizard?
-Mm-hmm.

474
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,277
Do you think if I went,
this wizard would give me brains?

475
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,320
I couldn't say.

476
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:06,491
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

477
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,160
-Yes, that's true.
-But maybe you better not.

478
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,830
I've got a witch mad at me,
and you might get into trouble.

479
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:17,085
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch!
I'm not afraid of anything!

480
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,840
-Except a lighted match.
-I don't blame you for that.

481
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,136
But I'd face a whole box of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

482
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,765
Look, I won't be any trouble,
because I don't eat a thing.

483
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,811
And I won't try to manage things,
because I can't think.

484
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,396
Won't you take me with you?

485
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,815
Why, of course I will!

486
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,444
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

487
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,030
You're not starting out very well.

488
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,324
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.

489
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,700
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

490
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,536
We're off to see the Wizard

491
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,330
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

492
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,916
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

493
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,545
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

494
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,090
Because, because, because
Because, because

495
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,010
Because of the wonderful things he does

496
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:14,142
We're off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

497
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,404
Oh.

498
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,366
Apples!

499
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,327
Oh, look!

500
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,497
Oh!

501
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,501
Ouch!

502
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,878
What do you think you're doing?

503
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:47,425
We've been walking a long ways
and I was hungry and

504
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,177
Did you say something?

505
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,346
-She was hungry!
She was hungry!

506
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,558
How would like to have someone come
along and pick something off of you?

507
00:39:55,726 --> 00:40:00,063
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

508
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,773
Come along, Dorothy.

509
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,234
You don't want any of those apples.
Hmm.

510
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,528
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they ought to be?

511
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:10,448
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't
like little green worms.

512
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,783
Oh, you!

513
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,873
I'll show you how to get apples.

514
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,627
Oh! Oh!

515
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:29,092
Hooray! I guess that did it. Help yourself.

516
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,161
Why, it's a man!

517
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,747
A man made out of tin!

518
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,916
Yes!

519
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,294
Look!

520
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,799
Did you say something?

521
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,803
He said "oilcan."

522
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,640
-Oil can what?
-Oilcan?

523
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,977
Oh, here it is.

524
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,646
Where do you want to be oiled first?

525
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,525
He said his mouth.

526
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,822
The other side.

527
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,999
Mm.... Mm.... Mm....

528
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,127
My goodness! I can talk again! Oh!

529
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,089
Oil my arms, please. Oil my elbows.

530
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,674
Here.

531
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,598
-Did that hurt?
-No, it feels wonderful.

532
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,142
I've held that axe up for ages.

533
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,980
Goodness!
How did you ever get like this?

534
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,650
Well, about a year ago...

535
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,610
...I was chopping that tree...

536
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,654
...when suddenly it began to rain.

537
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,824
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.

538
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,702
And I've been that way ever since.

539
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,415
Well, you're perfect now.

540
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,501
My neck. My neck.

541
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,044
Perfect?

542
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,047
Bang on my chest
if you think I'm perfect.

543
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,508
Go ahead, bang on it!

544
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,179
Beautiful! What an echo!

545
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,265
It's empty.

546
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,269
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

547
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,479
-No heart?
-No heart?

548
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,314
No heart.

549
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,733
All hollow.

550
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,781
When a man's an empty kettle

551
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,242
He should be on his mettle

552
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,079
And yet I'm torn apart

553
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:08,126
Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human

554
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,421
If I only had a heart

555
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:17,594
I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental

556
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,014
Regarding love and art

557
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,436
I'd be friends with the sparrows
And the boy who shoots the arrows

558
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,732
If I only had a heart

559
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:35,737
Picture me
A balcony

560
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:40,366
Above, a voice sings low

561
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:44,329
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

562
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,497
I hear a beat

563
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,000
How sweet!

564
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:54,088
Just to register emotion
Jealousy, devotion

565
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,967
And really feel the part

566
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:04,015
I could stay young and chipper
And I'd lock it with a zipper

567
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,644
If I only had a heart

568
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,310
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

569
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,313
-Are you all right?
-I'm a little rusty yet.

570
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,441
Oh, dear!

571
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,901
That was wonderful!

572
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:43,197
You know, we were wondering
why you couldn't come with us...

573
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,492
...to the Emerald City
to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.

574
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,537
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there.

575
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,247
Oh, but he will!

576
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,790
He must!

577
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,460
We've come such a long way already.

578
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,678
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun!

579
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,348
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

580
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,768
Well, stay away from her...

581
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,020
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

582
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,397
And you!

583
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,358
I'll use you for a beehive!

584
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,945
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?

585
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,119
Fire! I'm burning! I'm burning!

586
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,674
I'm not afraid of her.

587
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:47,512
I'll see you get safely to the Wizard,
whether I get a brain or not!

588
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,013
Stuff a mattress with me!

589
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,018
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

590
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,978
Beehive! Bah!

591
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,482
Let her try and make
a beehive out of me.

592
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,737
Oh, you're the best friends
anybody ever had.

593
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:09,325
And it's funny, but I feel as if
I've known you all the time.

594
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,662
-But I couldn't have, could I?
-I don't see how.

595
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,165
You weren't around when I was
stuffed and sewn together, were you?

596
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,086
And I was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

597
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,964
Still, I wish I could remember.

598
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,552
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.
We know each other now, don't we?

599
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,887
-That's right.
-We do.

600
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,806
-To Oz?
-To Oz!

601
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,808
We're off to see the Wizard

602
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,810
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

603
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:39,230
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

604
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,692
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

605
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,237
Because, because, because
Because, because

606
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,240
Because of the wonderful things he does

607
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:56,747
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

608
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,855
I don't like this forest.

609
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,525
It's dark and creepy.

610
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:30,114
Of course, I don't know, but I think
it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

611
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,574
Do....

612
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,493
Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

613
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,287
We might.

614
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:40,041
Animals that eat straw?

615
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,669
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

616
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,296
-Lions!
-And tigers?

617
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,131
And bears!

618
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,177
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

619
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:55,056
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

620
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,808
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

621
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,061
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

622
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,355
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

623
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,651
Oh!

624
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,299
Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

625
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,176
Which one of you first?

626
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,720
I'll fight you both together,
if you want.

627
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,140
I'll fight you with
one paw tied behind my back!

628
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,518
I'll fight you standing on one foot!

629
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,187
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

630
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:46,482
Oh, pulling an ax on me, eh?

631
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,903
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why....

632
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,616
-Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
-Oh, scared, huh?

633
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,201
Afraid, huh?

634
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,578
How long can you stay fresh
in that can?

635
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:06,002
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard.

636
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:09,130
Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

637
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,881
That's getting personal, Lion.

638
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,968
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

639
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,554
What's wrong with you teaching him?

640
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,681
Well, I hardly know him.

641
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,476
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.

642
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,071
Shame on you!

643
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,367
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him.

644
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,453
No, but you tried to.

645
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,331
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but picking on poor little dogs....

646
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:48,127
Well, you didn't have to go
and hit me, did you?

647
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,463
Is my nose bleeding?

648
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,049
Well, of course not.

649
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,927
My goodness,
what a fuss you're making!

650
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:01,432
Well, naturally, when you go around
picking on things weaker than you are....

651
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,350
You're nothing but a big coward!

652
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,978
You're right, I am a coward!

653
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,523
I haven't any courage at all.

654
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,443
I even scare myself!

655
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,404
Look at the circles under my eyes.

656
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,364
I haven't slept in weeks.

657
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,492
Why don't you try counting sheep?

658
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:23,329
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.

659
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,457
Oh, that's too bad.

660
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,335
Don't you think the Wizard
could help him too?

661
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,587
I don't see why not.

662
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,130
Come along with us.

663
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,217
We're on our way to see the Wizard.
To get him a heart.

664
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,553
-And him a brain.
-He could give you some courage.

665
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:45,142
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

666
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,852
I would.

667
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,313
No, of course not.

668
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:53,442
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

669
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,279
-My life has been simply unbearable.
-Oh.

670
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,490
Well, it's all right now.

671
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,992
The Wizard'll fix everything.

672
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,995
It's been in me so long.

673
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,498
I just gotta tell you how I feel.

674
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,500
Well, come on!

675
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,545
Yeah, it's sad,
Believe me, missy

676
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,380
When you're born to be a sissy

677
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,258
Without the vim and verve

678
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,138
But I could show my prowess
Be a lion, not a mouse

679
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,057
If I only had the nerve

680
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:30,271
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandy lion

681
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,982
A fate I don't deserve

682
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:37,945
-I'd be brave as a blizzard
-I'd be gentle as a lizard

683
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,947
I'd be clever as a gizzard

684
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:45,411
If the Wizard is a wizard
Who will serve

685
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,413
Then I'm sure to get a brain

686
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,540
-A heart
-A home

687
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,250
The nerve!

688
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,210
Oh

689
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,630
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

690
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,384
We hear he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was

691
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,596
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was
The Wizard of Oz is one because

692
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,099
Because, because, because
Because, because

693
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,311
Because of the wonderful things he does

694
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,774
We're off to see the Wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz

695
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,076
So you won't take warning, eh?

696
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,078
All the worse for you, then.

697
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,957
I'll take care of you now
instead of later!

698
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,046
When I gain those ruby slippers...

699
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,591
...my power will be the greatest in Oz!

700
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,761
And now, my beauties...

701
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,139
...something with poison in it, I think.

702
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,475
With poison in it.

703
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:55,231
But attractive to the eye
and soothing to the smell!

704
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,442
Poppies.

705
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,903
Poppies!

706
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,490
Poppies will put them to sleep.

707
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,784
Sleep....

708
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,746
Now they'll sleep.

709
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,193
There's Emerald City!

710
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,030
Oh, we're almost there!
At last! At last!

711
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:49,243
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

712
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,621
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that.

713
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,790
Come on, what are we waiting for?

714
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,085
Nothing! Let's hurry!
Yes, let's run!

715
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,967
-Come on! Come on!
-Hurry! Hurry!

716
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,764
Oh, look!

717
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,100
Come on! Come on!

718
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,477
Look at the scenery. It's wonderful!

719
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,187
Emerald City!

720
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,403
Oh. What's happening?

721
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,322
What is it?

722
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,657
I can't run anymore.

723
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,077
-I'm so sleepy.
-Give us your hands and we'll pull you.

724
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,706
Oh, no, please.
I have to rest for just a minute.

725
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,417
Toto. Where's Toto?

726
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,045
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

727
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,716
Don't cry.
You'll rust yourself again!

728
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,803
Coming to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

729
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,639
-Don't you start it too!
-No!

730
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,391
We ought to carry Dorothy.

731
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,602
I don't think I could,
but we could try.

732
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,729
-Let's.
-Yes.

733
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,692
-Now look at him. This is terrible!
-Here, Tin Man, help me.

734
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,489
Oh, this is terrible!
I can't budge her an inch.

735
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,282
This is a spell, this is!

736
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,410
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?

737
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,038
Help! Help!

738
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,374
It's no use screaming
at a time like this.

739
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,502
Nobody will hear you!
Help! Help!

740
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,712
Help!

741
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,009
It's snowing!

742
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,846
No, it isn't.

743
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,599
Yes, it is!

744
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,601
Maybe that'll help!

745
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,729
Oh, but it couldn't help!

746
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,734
It does help!
Dorothy, you're waking up!

747
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,487
Oh. Oh.

748
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,827
Unusual weather we're having,
ain't it?

749
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,622
Look! He's rusted again.

750
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,376
-Oh, give me the oilcan, quick!
Here.

751
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,545
-He is rusted.
Here.

752
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:08,424
Here.
Quick! Oh! Oh!

753
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,134
Curses! Curses!

754
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,594
Somebody always helps that girl.

755
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,517
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.

756
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,269
And woe to those who try to stop me!

757
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,896
Come on, let's get out of here.

758
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,399
Look! Emerald City is closer
and prettier than ever!

759
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,359
You're out of the woods

760
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,945
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night

761
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,991
Step into the sun
Step into the light

762
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,286
Keep straight ahead for
The most glorious place

763
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:42,040
On the face of the earth
Or the sky

764
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,001
Hold on to your breath
Hold on to your heart

765
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,211
Hold on to your hope

766
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,840
March up to the gate
And bid it open

767
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,640
To the Emerald City,
as fast as lightning!

768
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,527
You're out of the woods

769
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,988
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night

770
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,073
Step into the sun
Step into the light

771
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,951
March up to the gate
And bid it...

772
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,037
...open

773
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,164
Open

774
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,463
Who rang that bell?

775
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,548
We did!
-Can't you read?

776
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,967
-Read what?
-The notice!

777
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,011
What notice?
-It's on the door!

778
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,640
As plain as the nose on my face!

779
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,183
Oh.... Uh....

780
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,852
Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk.

781
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,194
"Bell out of order. Please knock."

782
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,156
Well! That's more like it!

783
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,158
Now, state your business.

784
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,953
We wanna see the Wizard.

785
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,789
The Wizard?

786
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,542
But nobody can see the great Oz.

787
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,921
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!

788
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,590
Well, then, how do you know
there is one?

789
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,759
Because he's

790
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,513
Oh! You're wasting my time!

791
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,684
Oh, please. Please, sir.
I've got to see the Wizard.

792
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:27,229
-The Good Witch of the North sent me.
-Prove it!

793
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,649
She's wearing the ruby slippers
that she gave her.

794
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,824
Oh! So she is!
Well, bust my buttons!

795
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,451
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

796
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,870
That's a horse of a different color!

797
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,540
Come on in!

798
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,136
Cabby! Cabby!

799
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:03,223
Just what you're looking for.
Take you any place in the city, we does.

800
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:08,478
-Would you take us to see the Wizard?
-The Wizard? The Wizard?

801
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:12,899
Yes, of course. But first I'll
take you to a little place...

802
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,903
-...where you can tidy up a bit.
-Oh, thank you so much!

803
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:21,825
We've been gone such a long time,
and we feel so mess

804
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,413
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!

805
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,542
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.

806
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,504
He's the horse of a different color
you've heard tell about.

807
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,548
Ha-ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

808
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,592
And a couple of tra-la-las

809
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,055
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

810
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,890
Bzz, bzz, bzz!
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

811
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,933
And a couple of la-di-das

812
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,896
That's how the crickets crick all day
In the merry old land of Oz

813
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:55,108
We get up at twelve
And start to work at one

814
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,403
Take an hour for lunch
And then at two we're done

815
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,613
Jolly good fun!

816
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,406
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

817
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,533
And a couple of tra-la-las

818
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:07,746
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

819
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,915
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

820
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,708
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

821
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:14,086
That's how we laugh the day away
With a

822
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,962
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!

823
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,298
In the merry old land of Oz

824
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,217
Pat, pat here
Pat, pat there

825
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,260
And a couple of brand-new straws

826
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:26,807
That's how we keep you young and fair
In the merry old land of Oz

827
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,934
Rub, rub here
Rub, rub there

828
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,769
Whether you're tin or bronze

829
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:34,690
That's how we keep you in repair
In the merry old land of Oz

830
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,902
We can make a dimpled smile
Out of a frown

831
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,655
Can you even dye my eyes
To match my gown?

832
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,573
-Uh-huh
Jolly old town!

833
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,575
Clip, clip here
Clip, clip there

834
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,577
We give the roughest claws

835
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:52,332
That certain air of savoir-faire
In the merry old land of Oz

836
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,798
That's how we laugh the day away
In the merry old land of Oz

837
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,135
That's how we laugh the day away
With a ha-ha-ha

838
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,434
In the merry old land of Oz

839
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,953
Who's her? Who's her?

840
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,914
It's the witch!
She's followed us here!

841
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,333
"Surrender, Dorothy."

842
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,503
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

843
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,423
-The Wizard will explain it!
-To the Wizard!

844
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,842
Dear! Whatever shall we do?

845
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,803
We better hurry if we're
gonna see the Wizard!

846
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:52,058
Here! Here, here!
Everything is all right.

847
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,060
Stop that now, just

848
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,730
It's all right!
Everything is all right!

849
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:01,359
The great and powerful Oz
has got matters well in hand.

850
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,861
I hope.

851
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,364
So you can all go home!
There's nothing to worry about!

852
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,951
Get out of here. Now go on!
Go on home.

853
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,995
Go home.

854
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,916
We want to see the Wizard right away.
All four of us.

855
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:20,796
Orders are, nobody can see
the great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!

856
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,548
But, please! It's very important.

857
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,926
I got a permanent
just for the occasion.

858
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,678
Not nobody, not nohow!

859
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,263
But she's Dorothy!

860
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,517
The witch's Dorothy?

861
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,478
Well, that makes a difference.

862
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:41,733
Just wait here.
I'll announce you at once.

863
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,948
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once.

864
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:51,326
-I've as good as got my brain.
-I can fairly hear my heart beating.

865
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,828
I'll be home for supper.

866
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,622
In another hour,
I'll be king of the forest.

867
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,000
Long live the king!

868
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:11,346
If I were king of the forest

869
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,014
Not queen

870
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,641
Not duke

871
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,060
Not prince

872
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:21,815
My regal robes of the forest

873
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,400
Would be satin

874
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,110
Not cotton

875
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,280
Not chintz

876
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:32,075
I'd command each thing
Be it fish or fowl

877
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,535
With a woof!

878
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,036
And a woof!

879
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,290
And a royal growl

880
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,752
As I'd click my heel
All the trees would kneel

881
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,632
And the mountains bow
And the bulls kowtow

882
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:55,140
And the sparrow would take wing

883
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,975
If I

884
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:03,148
If I were king

885
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:07,527
Each rabbit would show respect to me

886
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:11,239
The chipmunks genuflect to me

887
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,158
Though my tail would lash

888
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,076
I would show compash

889
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,289
For every underling

890
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,374
If I

891
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:25,837
If I were king

892
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:32,218
Just king

893
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:08,088
Monarch of all I survey

894
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:13,510
Monarch

895
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:18,974
Of all I survey

896
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,895
If you were king,
you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

897
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:27,148
Not nobody, not nohow!

898
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,776
-Not even a rhinoceros?
-Imposserous!

899
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,780
-How about a hippopotamus?
-I'd trash him from top to "bottom-us."

900
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,242
-Supposing you met an elephant?
-I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant"!

901
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,037
-What if it were a brontosaurus?
-I'd show him who's king of the forest!

902
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,498
How?
-How?

903
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,375
Courage!

904
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,545
What makes a king out of a slave?
Courage!

905
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:53,049
What makes the flag on the mast
to wave? Courage!

906
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,260
What makes the elephant
charge his tusk...

907
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,847
...in the misty mist
or the dusky dusk?

908
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:03,810
What makes the muskrat
guard his musk? Courage!

909
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,980
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder? Courage!

910
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:11,735
What makes the dawn come up
like thunder? Courage!

911
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,820
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

912
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,197
What puts the "ape" in apricot?

913
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,908
What have they got that I ain't got?

914
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:22,037
Courage!
-You can say that again.

915
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,164
Huh?

916
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,127
The Wizard says go away!

917
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,551
Go away?

918
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,138
Looks like we came a long way
for nothing.

919
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,476
And I was so happy.

920
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,728
I thought I was on my way home.

921
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,564
Don't cry.
We're gonna get you to the Wizard.

922
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,108
We certainly are.

923
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,611
Auntie Em was so good to me...

924
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,030
...and I never appreciated it.

925
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,492
Running away and hurting her feelings.

926
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,828
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

927
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,955
She may be dying...

928
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,083
...and it's all my fault.

929
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,880
I'll never forgive myself.

930
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,841
Never, never, never.

931
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,181
Please don't cry anymore.

932
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,559
I'll get you into the Wizard somehow.

933
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:30,814
Come on.
I had an Aunt Em myself once.

934
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,669
Wait a minute, fellas.

935
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,631
I was just thinking, I really don't want
to see the Wizard this much.

936
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,800
I better wait for you outside.

937
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,803
-What's the matter?
-He's just scared again.

938
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,472
Don't you know the Wizard
will give you courage?

939
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,934
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

940
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,311
Well, then, we'll ask him for you.

941
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,647
I'd sooner wait outside.

942
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,607
Why? Why?

943
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:18,278
Because I'm still scared!

944
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,368
-What happened?
-Somebody pulled my tail.

945
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,579
You did it yourself.

946
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,372
-Oh.
-Here.

947
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,332
Come on.

948
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,172
Come forward!

949
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,424
Tell me when it's over!

950
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,020
Look at that. Look at that!

951
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,902
I wanna go home!

952
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,488
I am Oz...

953
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:05,533
...the great and powerful!

954
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,869
Who are you?

955
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,914
Who are you?

956
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,712
If you please...

957
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,423
...I am Dorothy...

958
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,343
...the small and meek.

959
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,887
We've come to ask you

960
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:27,847
-Silence!
-Oh!

961
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,642
Oh! Jiminy crickets!

962
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,603
The great and powerful Oz...

963
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,773
...knows why you have come.

964
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:39,025
Step forward...

965
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,110
...Tin Man!

966
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:50,495
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

967
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,498
You clinking, clanking, clattering...

968
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:57,335
...collection of caliginous junk!

969
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,881
Yes, sir.

970
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,466
Yes, Your Honor.

971
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,093
You see...

972
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,763
...a while back, we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road and

973
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,348
Quiet!

974
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,978
And you, Scarecrow...

975
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,481
...have the effrontery
to ask for a brain...

976
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:23,403
...you billowing bale of bovine fodder!

977
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,739
Yes, Your Honor.
I mean, Your Excellency.

978
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:29,158
I mean, Your Wizardry!

979
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,035
Enough!

980
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,955
And you, Lion!

981
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,005
Well?

982
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,305
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself...

983
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,558
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

984
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,352
Silence, whippersnapper!

985
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,899
The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests.

986
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,486
What's that? What'd he say?
Huh? What'd he say?

987
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:09,115
But first, you must prove
yourselves worthy...

988
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:13,077
...by performing a very small task.

989
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,749
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

990
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,044
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it.

991
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:23,671
Bring me her broomstick...

992
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,841
...and I'll grant your requests.

993
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,635
Now go!

994
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,096
But what if she kills us first?

995
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,556
I said go!

996
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:23,731
"I'd turn back if I were you."

997
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,431
I believe there's spooks around here.

998
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,934
That's ridiculous!
Spooks. That's silly.

999
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,395
Don't you believe in spooks?

1000
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,814
No. Why, only Oh!

1001
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,575
Are you all right?

1002
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,326
I do believe in spooks.

1003
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,620
I do, I do, I do, I do.

1004
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:24,459
I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!

1005
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,422
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

1006
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,510
Take your army and bring me
that girl and her dog.

1007
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:37,972
Do what you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed.

1008
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,641
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.

1009
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:44,896
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

1010
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:49,484
Take special care of those slippers.
I want those most of all.

1011
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,360
Now, fly! Fly!

1012
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:54,071
Bring me that girl and her slippers!

1013
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,116
Fly! Fly! Fly!

1014
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,897
Help! Help!

1015
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,982
Go away now!

1016
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,363
Toto! Toto! Help!

1017
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,297
Help! Help! Help!

1018
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:54,799
What happened to you?

1019
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,301
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

1020
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:00,054
Then they took my chest
and threw it over there!

1021
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,556
That's you all over.

1022
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,724
They sure knocked
the stuffings out of you.

1023
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:07,436
Don't stand there. Put me together.
We've got to find Dorothy!

1024
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:09,105
Now, let's see....

1025
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:15,152
What a nice little dog.

1026
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:22,326
And you, my dear.
What an unexpected pleasure.

1027
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:26,872
It's so kind of you to visit me
in my loneliness.

1028
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:31,085
What are you gonna do with my dog?
Give him back to me!

1029
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,713
All in good time, my little pretty.

1030
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,842
-All in good time.
-Please give me back my dog.

1031
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,344
Certainly, certainly...

1032
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,472
...when you give me those slippers.

1033
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:47,476
-But the Good Witch told me not to.
-Very well.

1034
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,812
Throw that basket in the river
and drown him.

1035
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:54,108
No! Here. You can have your old
slippers, but give me back Toto!

1036
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,943
That's a good little girl.

1037
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,738
I knew you'd see reason!

1038
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,453
I'm sorry! I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1039
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,957
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...

1040
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,376
...those slippers will
never come off...

1041
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:16,464
...as long as you're alive.

1042
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:20,468
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.

1043
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,179
These things
must be done delicately...

1044
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,556
...or you hurt the spell.

1045
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:29,435
Run, Toto, run!
Catch him, you fool!

1046
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:41,113
Run, Toto, run!

1047
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,949
Run, Toto, run!

1048
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,495
He got away! He got away!

1049
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,206
Which is more than you will!

1050
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,916
Drat, you and your dog!

1051
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,752
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth.

1052
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,005
But it'll soon be over now!

1053
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:00,800
Do you see that?

1054
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:03,511
That's how much longer
you've got to be alive.

1055
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,889
And it isn't long, my pretty.
It isn't long!

1056
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,850
I can't wait forever
to get those shoes!

1057
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,708
I'm frightened.

1058
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:37,670
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened.

1059
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,967
Dorothy! Dorothy!

1060
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:46,721
Where are you?
It's me. It's Auntie Em.

1061
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:50,057
We're trying to find you.
Where are you?

1062
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,268
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

1063
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,770
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

1064
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:57,940
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

1065
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:00,693
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

1066
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:04,238
I'm frightened!
Come back! Come back!

1067
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,491
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"

1068
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,202
I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

1069
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:41,108
Look! There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?

1070
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:46,739
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy.

1071
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,325
Come on, fellas!

1072
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,762
I hope my strength holds out.

1073
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,640
I hope your tail holds out.

1074
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,237
What's that? What's that?

1075
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,198
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch.

1076
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:33,035
-Dorothy's in that awful place?
-I hate to think of her in there.

1077
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,955
-We've got to get her out.
-Don't cry now.

1078
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:39,542
We haven't got the oilcan, and you've
been squeaking enough as it is.

1079
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,669
Who's them? Who's them?

1080
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:59,728
-I've got a plan how to get in there.
-Fine. He's got a plan.

1081
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:02,731
-And you're gonna lead us.
-Yeah.

1082
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:05,317
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1083
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:09,196
-I gotta get her out of there?
-That's right.

1084
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,616
All right, I'll go in there
for Dorothy.

1085
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,785
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

1086
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:18,581
...guards or no guards,
I'll tear them apart.

1087
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:22,835
I may not come out alive,
but I'm going in there.

1088
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:26,881
-There's only one thing I want you to do.
-What's that?

1089
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,341
Talk me out of it.

1090
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,428
-No, you don't!
-Oh, no.

1091
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,388
-Now, wait a minute.
Up!

1092
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,990
Shh!

1093
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,588
Shh! Shh!

1094
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:36,492
Come on, I've got another idea.

1095
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,245
Do you think it would be polite,
dropping in like this?

1096
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,448
-Where do we go now?
-Yeah.

1097
01:23:18,868 --> 01:23:20,077
There!

1098
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:32,798
Wait! We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1099
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,883
It's us!
-Yes!

1100
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:38,012
It's me! She's locked me in!

1101
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,597
We gotta get her out! Open the door!

1102
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,808
Oh, hurry! Please hurry!

1103
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,768
The hourglass is almost empty!

1104
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,562
Stand back!

1105
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:05,039
Oh, Toto! Toto! Oh, Lion!

1106
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,249
I knew you'd come!
I knew you would!

1107
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,252
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

1108
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:25,392
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.

1109
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,605
Why, my little party's just beginning.

1110
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:32,483
Trapped. Trapped like mice...rats.

1111
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,702
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.

1112
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,497
We'll let them think about it
a little first.

1113
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,717
Seize them! Seize them!

1114
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,719
Stop them, you fools!

1115
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:04,264
Seize them! Seize them!

1116
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:14,900
There they go! Now we've got them!

1117
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,444
Half of you go this way,
half of you go that way.

1118
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:18,779
Hurry! Hurry!

1119
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:28,580
Where do we go now?

1120
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:31,542
This way. Come on!

1121
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,466
Back! Back!

1122
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,653
Well!

1123
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,614
Ring-around the rosie,
a pocket full of spears!

1124
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:05,492
Thought you'd be pretty foxy,
didn't you?

1125
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,788
The last to go will see
the first three go before her.

1126
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,000
And her mangy little dog too!

1127
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,677
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

1128
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:29,266
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!
It's burning! Help!

1129
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,893
Don't throw that water!

1130
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,647
You cursed brat!
Look what you've done!

1131
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,317
I'm melting! Melting!

1132
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:40,861
Oh, what a world! What a world!

1133
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,488
Who would've thought
a good little girl like you...

1134
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,742
...could destroy
my beautiful wickedness?

1135
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,536
Look out! Look out!

1136
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,747
I'm going.

1137
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,806
She's dead. You've killed her.

1138
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:13,227
I didn't mean to kill her.
Really, I didn't.

1139
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,146
It's just that he was on fire.

1140
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,690
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1141
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:22,694
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1142
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:24,154
The broom.

1143
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:26,823
-May we have it?
-Please. And take it with you.

1144
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,451
Oh, thank you so much!

1145
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:32,454
Now we can go tell the Wizard
the Wicked Witch is dead!

1146
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,081
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1147
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,833
Can I believe my eyes?

1148
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:40,087
Why have you come back?

1149
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:44,091
Please, sir. We've done
what you told us.

1150
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:47,511
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

1151
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,721
We melted her.

1152
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:53,642
Ah, you liquidated her, eh?

1153
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,811
-Very resourceful.
-Yes, sir.

1154
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,398
So we'd like you to keep your promise
to us, if you please, sir.

1155
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:02,901
Not so fast. Not so fast!

1156
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:05,654
I'll have to give the matter
a little thought.

1157
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,865
Go away and come back tomorrow.

1158
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:13,245
Tomorrow?
Oh, but I wanna go home now!

1159
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:16,373
-You've had plenty of time already.
-Yeah.

1160
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:20,419
Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Oz!

1161
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:23,714
I said come back tomorrow!

1162
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:26,967
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises.

1163
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:30,804
Do you presume to criticize
the great Oz?

1164
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,473
You ungrateful creatures!

1165
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:37,394
Think yourselves lucky that I'm
giving you audience tomorrow...

1166
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:40,397
...instead of 20 years from now!

1167
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,857
Oh!

1168
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:46,445
The great Oz has spoken! Oh!

1169
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:50,407
Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.

1170
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:53,952
The great and
Oz has spoken.

1171
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,079
Who are you?

1172
01:28:56,247 --> 01:29:00,250
I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz.

1173
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,670
You are? I don't believe you.

1174
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:07,299
I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other Wizard except me.

1175
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:09,801
-You humbug!
-Yeah.

1176
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:13,472
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.

1177
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,600
You're a very bad man!

1178
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:19,770
Oh, no, my dear. I'm a very good man.

1179
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:23,482
I'm just a very bad wizard.

1180
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:25,692
What about the heart
you promised Tin Man?

1181
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,861
And the courage you promised
Cowardly Lion?

1182
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,946
-And Scarecrow's brain?
-And Scarecrow's brain?

1183
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:34,034
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1184
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:37,079
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1185
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:40,707
...or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain.

1186
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,085
Back where I come from,
we have universities...

1187
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:46,630
...seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1188
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:50,926
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

1189
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:55,097
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1190
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:59,309
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

1191
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:03,313
...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...

1192
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,649
...I hereby confer upon you...

1193
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:10,779
-...the honorary degree of Th.D.
-Th.D.?

1194
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:13,323
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1195
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,284
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1196
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,413
...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1197
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,624
Oh, joy! Rapture!

1198
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,543
I've got a brain!

1199
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:27,003
-How can I thank you enough?
-Well, you can't.

1200
01:30:27,171 --> 01:30:31,091
As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganized thinking.

1201
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:35,011
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

1202
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:39,099
...you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1203
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:43,228
Back where I come from,
we have men who are called "heroes."

1204
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,565
Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

1205
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,984
...and parade it down the main street.

1206
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:51,361
And they have no more courage
than you have.

1207
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:56,616
But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

1208
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:58,118
Therefore...

1209
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,872
...for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valor...

1210
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:05,167
...conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

1211
01:31:05,334 --> 01:31:08,587
...I award you the Triple Cross.

1212
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:11,381
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage.

1213
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:17,804
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.

1214
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:22,976
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

1215
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,770
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1216
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:30,192
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

1217
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,111
But I still want one.

1218
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:37,449
Back where I come from, there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1219
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,118
They are called phil

1220
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:44,664
Good-deed-doers. And their hearts
are no bigger than yours.

1221
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:49,044
But they have one thing
you haven't got. A testimonial.

1222
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:52,005
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

1223
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:55,008
...I take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

1224
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:58,803
...with a small token
of our esteem and affection.

1225
01:31:58,971 --> 01:32:01,890
And remember,
my sentimental friend...

1226
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:05,185
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

1227
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,355
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

1228
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:09,856
Ah.

1229
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,610
Oh! It ticks!

1230
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,154
Listen! Look, it ticks!

1231
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:19,407
Read what my medal says. "Courage."

1232
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:21,910
Ain't it the truth!
Ain't it the truth!

1233
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,703
Oh, they're all wonderful.

1234
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,248
Hey, what about Dorothy?

1235
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:30,460
Yes, how about Dorothy?
-Yeah. Dorothy next.

1236
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:34,172
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1237
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,383
You force me into
a cataclysmic decision.

1238
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,595
The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas
is for me to take her myself.

1239
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:45,433
Oh, will you? Could you? Oh!

1240
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:48,228
But are you clever enough
to manage it?

1241
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:52,482
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...

1242
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:55,402
...born and bred
in the western wilderness...

1243
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,698
...premier balloonist par excellence to the
Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

1244
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:04,661
Until one day, while performing
feats of stratospheric skill...

1245
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,205
...never before attempted
by civilized man...

1246
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:11,960
...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.

1247
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:14,254
-It did?
-Weren't you frightened?

1248
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:17,924
You are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death...

1249
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:22,762
...sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe. I was petrified.

1250
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,598
Suddenly the wind changed...

1251
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:28,101
...and the balloon floated down
into this noble city...

1252
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:33,481
...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz,
the first wizard deluxe!

1253
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:36,484
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...

1254
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:40,947
...retaining my balloon
against the advent of a quick getaway.

1255
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:43,241
And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...

1256
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:48,413
...you and I will return to
the land of E Pluribus Unum.

1257
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:57,464
My friends. I mean, my friends!

1258
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:06,890
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown...

1259
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:09,017
...be that as it may.

1260
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:12,854
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...

1261
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:15,357
...am about to embark
upon a hazardous...

1262
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:18,401
...and technically
unexplainable journey...

1263
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:21,863
...into the outer stratosphere!

1264
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:26,576
To confer, converse...

1265
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:30,330
...and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

1266
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:34,084
And I hereby decree
that until what time...

1267
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:36,586
...if any, that I return...

1268
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:41,508
...the Scarecrow, by virtue
of his highly superior brains...

1269
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,551
...shall rule in my stead...

1270
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:48,306
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

1271
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:52,310
...and the Lion,
by virtue of his courage.

1272
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:55,105
Obey them as you would me.
Thank you.

1273
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,945
Oh, Toto! Come back! Toto!

1274
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:04,531
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.

1275
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,740
Stop that dog!

1276
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:10,662
This is a highly irregular procedure.
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1277
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,915
-Ruined my exit!
Come back! Come back!

1278
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:16,626
Don't go without me!
Please come back!

1279
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:20,130
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!

1280
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:21,798
Goodbye, folks!

1281
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,092
Goodbye!

1282
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:30,390
Oh, now I'll never get home.

1283
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,184
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1284
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:35,061
We all love you.

1285
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,731
We don't want you to go.

1286
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:40,233
That's very kind of you...

1287
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:43,486
...but this could never be like Kansas.

1288
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:47,866
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1289
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:51,077
Oh, Scarecrow,
what am I going to do?

1290
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,080
Look!

1291
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:56,374
Here's someone who can help you!

1292
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:34,162
-Will you help me? Can you help me?
-You don't need help any longer.

1293
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:37,165
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1294
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:40,251
-I have?
-Then why didn't you tell her before?

1295
01:36:40,419 --> 01:36:44,422
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1296
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:47,008
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1297
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:48,843
Well....

1298
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:52,096
I think that it...

1299
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:56,267
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1300
01:36:56,435 --> 01:37:01,105
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1301
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:04,692
...I won't look any further
than my own back yard...

1302
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,195
...because if it isn't there...

1303
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:10,448
...I never really lost it to begin with.

1304
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:11,741
Is that right?

1305
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,701
That's all it is.

1306
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:17,038
But that's so easy!
I should've thought of it for you.

1307
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:20,959
-I should've felt it in my heart.
-She had to find it out for herself.

1308
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:24,629
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds.

1309
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,340
-Toto too?
-Toto too.

1310
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,592
-Now?
-Whenever you wish.

1311
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,263
Oh, dear.
That's too wonderful to be true!

1312
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,099
Oh, it's....

1313
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,727
It's gonna be so hard
to say goodbye.

1314
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:42,272
I love you all too.

1315
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:46,609
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1316
01:37:46,777 --> 01:37:49,028
Oh, don't cry.

1317
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:52,240
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1318
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,077
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1319
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,456
-Goodbye.
-Now I know I've got a heart...

1320
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,709
...because it's breaking.

1321
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:09,382
Goodbye, Lion.
I know it isn't right...

1322
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:13,303
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1323
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,972
...before you found your courage.

1324
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:20,226
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1325
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:28,026
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1326
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:36,075
-Are you ready now?
-Yes.

1327
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:39,954
Say goodbye, Toto.

1328
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:46,210
-Yes, I'm ready now.
-Then close your eyes...

1329
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:49,380
...and tap your heels
together three times...

1330
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,593
...and think to yourself:

1331
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,763
"There's no place like home.

1332
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:00,266
There's no place like home."

1333
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:03,978
There's no place like home.

1334
01:39:04,146 --> 01:39:07,649
There's no place like home.

1335
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,776
There's no place like home.

1336
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:13,029
There's no place like home.

1337
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:16,824
There's no place like home.

1338
01:39:21,246 --> 01:39:22,956
There's no place like home.

1339
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,917
There's no place like home.

1340
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:30,755
Wake up, honey.
-There's no place like home.

1341
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,342
There's no place like home.

1342
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:38,096
There's no....

1343
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:44,394
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1344
01:39:44,561 --> 01:39:46,646
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1345
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:49,816
-Yes, darling.
Hello there! Anybody home?

1346
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,653
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big

1347
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:57,615
-Well, she seems all right now.
-She got quite a bump on the head.

1348
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:00,326
We kind of thought
she was gonna leave us.

1349
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,204
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1350
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,373
And I tried to get back for days!

1351
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,500
There, there, lie quiet now.

1352
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,753
-You just had a bad dream.
-Sure.

1353
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,505
Remember me...

1354
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:14,924
...your old pal, Hunk?

1355
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,719
And me, Hickory?

1356
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,721
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1357
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:23,641
No. But it wasn't a dream.
It was a place.

1358
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:26,477
And you and you and you...

1359
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:28,563
...and you were there.

1360
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,691
But you couldn't have been,
could you?

1361
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,860
We dream lots
of silly things when we

1362
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:38,031
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1363
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:41,284
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1364
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,411
...but most of it was beautiful.

1365
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:47,457
But just the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

1366
01:40:47,624 --> 01:40:49,709
And they sent me home.

1367
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,379
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1368
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,631
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1369
01:40:55,799 --> 01:40:58,301
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1370
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:01,304
Home! And this is my room...

1371
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,056
...and you're all here.

1372
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,434
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1373
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,561
...because I love you all.

1374
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:12,190
And oh, Auntie Em...

1375
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:15,401
...there's no place like home!
