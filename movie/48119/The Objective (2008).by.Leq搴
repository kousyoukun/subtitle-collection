1
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:03,673
My name is Benjamin Keynes.

2
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:08,448
I work for the department operations,
of the CIA.

3
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,620
Three days after 9 / 11,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,780
picks up satellites
a radioactive signal,

5
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:17,442
in a remote part of Afghanistan.

6
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:22,296
The CIA feared that Al Qaeda
a nuclear weapon is secured.

7
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:27,458
I got information
of a reliable local source,

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,976
that perhaps something much more powerful.

9
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,709
It is more than a decade ago,
I have since departed.

10
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,411
I forgot how bad it could be.

11
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:00,876
I have the feeling that every time,
as we enter this country, we want uitspugen.

12
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,545
Almost everyone here has too busy
with the search for a war,

13
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:13,045
making them no attention to me.
And that's a good thing.

14
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:18,515
Sir, agent Keynes.

15
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,651
I finally met
the commander and team leader,

16
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,102
Sergeant Wallis Hamer.

17
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:28,643
I gave them the official story,
as if I voorlas from the memos in Langley.

18
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:34,252
Major Keynes, it is perhaps your party,
but they are men, okay?

19
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:36,650
Sure.

20
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:40,279
They thought that I lied.

21
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:56,473
My first assignment was contacted,
with my local source, Mohammed Aban.

22
00:01:56,723 --> 00:02:02,400
He asked me to come, so I hope
that he is there, if we are to knock him.

23
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,045
Sir, the men are ready for you

24
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:14,668
Major Keynes,
let me suggest one of the men.

25
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,759
This is my teamoudste, Tanner,
Information officer also.

26
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,651
He gets us back within a day.

27
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:25,519
Our doctor, sergeant Degetau.
-- How does it.

28
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,236
Explosives, Trinoski sergeant.
That there on the floor is sergeant Cole.

29
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:37,855
And last but not least, sergeant Sadler,
weapons and Afghanistan expert.

30
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,236
392 is a good team, you will find no better.

31
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,080
That is why I am here.

32
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:48,716
Gentlemen, thank you that you
at such short notice, wanted.

33
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:54,380
My orders are about the contact
with a certain Mohammed Aban.

34
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,036
A spiritual,
who lives in the southern provinces.

35
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:02,456
We want a recorded statement from him,
which he supports the U.S. mission here.

36
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,897
This is our man.

37
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,361
Look good.

38
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,451
Aban is highly respected
by the local population.

39
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:19,561
He is seen as the spiritual strength,
that the Mujahadin helped the Soviets to beat.

40
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:23,911
I thought that the CIA, the spiritual
force, which helped the Soviets to beat.

41
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:31,938
That depends on your definition,
of mental sergeant.

42
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:37,766
Aban was in hiding for the Taliban,
so it is important that we make contact,

43
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,617
once we have visibility of his position.

44
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,365
When we arrived there, we make contact
and we disappear again.

45
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:48,125
Smiles to the population,
conquer hearts, no doors-stroke, okay?

46
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,668
The mission will start at 1400 hours.

47
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:54,463
0130 inspection.

48
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,642
0230 departure.
-- We go.

49
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,916
Remember, nothing is routine.

50
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:11,558
Special Forces team 392.
I had heard of them.

51
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:18,219
She worked in the Zagran.
Smart men, they can handle secrets.

52
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,584
Vigorous as necessary.

53
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,181
A nice camera.

54
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:28,970
I gave my wife a wedding on our,
they do not know how they 'm to use.

55
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,763
But because his hair
never late, Ski.

56
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:36,646
What a man gives his wife
Now a camera on her wedding day.

57
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:41,746
Very romantic, Ski.
-- They used 'm for the baby, if it comes.

58
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:48,668
I would not want to be your wife,
legs spread and the child while filming.

59
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:52,385
Her sister, the recordings,
but they also know yet how it works.

60
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:56,992
But I mean, do not be surprised
bruinverbrand as that baby is born.

61
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,444
Two minutes.

62
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,170
Okay, you ready for this.

63
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:48,298
When I stepped from the helicopter,
I got a sense of enlightenment.

64
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,653
The time for a reconsideration is over.

65
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,994
The goal is all that counts.

66
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:57,140
I have no other choice,
then the goal.

67
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:06,642
It looks pretty quiet out from here.
-- Dan, I am always the most concern.

68
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:11,753
We can better establish an observatory.

69
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:20,337
Yes, ga with Pete to that hill,
Please indicate if it is safe to go.

70
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:25,251
For the others. Keynes and I
are the begroetingscomite. We go first.

71
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:29,401
Keynes, are you ready?
-- Yes, let's go.

72
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:35,432
Keep your eyes open.
It can wemelen of the enemies.

73
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:57,965
Hello.

74
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,271
Let me talk with her.

75
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,301
Good morning, how are today.

76
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:11,541
We come in peace.
We'd like Mohammed Aban.

77
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:36,080
Mohammed Aban live here no more.
He lives in the holy mountains.

78
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,047
Only the village elders know where that is.

79
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:47,411
Sorry. We would be honoured
Mohammed Aban to speak.

80
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:55,943
If he would like to help us,
that is good for your tribe.

81
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:58,137
Follow me.

82
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:01,477
Thank you!

83
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:04,836
There is nothing changed,
since my last stay.

84
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:10,715
You can only to the color of
Uniforms, in which period you are.

85
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,393
Hello, we are looking Mohammed Aban.

86
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,149
Aban nam, a week before the orders came
to be here to be executed, contact.

87
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:35,519
He had little coherent
and I thought ie lost his mind.

88
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,392
That was, that we saw themselves.

89
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:50,123
My grandfather said that he departed,
because the Taliban had killed him otherwise.

90
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:56,192
The woman with whom we spoke told
that he was in the mountains, you know where?

91
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:04,492
This is sacred ground, the Taliban have not come,
that is forbidden by God, Allah.

92
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:08,342
I understand it.
-- What do you want, chocolate?

93
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,676
This is special, from New York.
What you will find here.

94
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:15,310
And this, you are smart, eh?

95
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:18,231
It seems,
as if we are back behind ghosts maximum capacity.

96
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,140
It is ghostly, eh?

97
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,375
Hey, did you cope with camera
good view?

98
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,675
No, what is there.
-- That you do not buy in a regular store.

99
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:31,710
Give me the radio.

100
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:38,450
Snake 76. Snake 76.
This beast is 92, left.

101
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:46,832
Hose 76, the packet is not here,
request to be met back on.

102
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,108
Can I use my camera?
I want the Americans to show

103
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:07,877
how the house
of a holy man looks like.

104
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:52,320
We found Aban's house,
but we had now found evidence?

105
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,469
I wonder,
what these people would do,

106
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,356
when they suddenly came to power,
to destroy a nation.

107
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:28,556
We can only hope,
that they have become tired of the fighting.

108
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,249
Eat please.

109
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:04,028
Why do you want to speak with our holy?

110
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:10,248
We want an explanation from him,
to liberate your country from the Taliban.

111
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:20,894
My grandfather says that nobody
Afghanistan freed of the Taliban,

112
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,606
that can only Allah.

113
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,901
I believe that Allah gave us in your area.

114
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,407
Most Americans
realize that just yet.

115
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:35,683
Do you know where those sacred mountains?

116
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,019
Yes, my father took me
a few years ago.

117
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,687
He showed where he wanted to be buried,
since it is now too late, he was kidnapped

118
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:47,587
by the Taliban, I fear that he is dead.

119
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,167
Is this holy place 'Dashtun'?

120
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,283
How do you know that?

121
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:59,939
I've lived here long ago.

122
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:07,384
I see the desert in your eyes.
-- What he said?

123
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:13,419
I think that he can help us.
-- You have until 0300, then we leave.

124
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,225
I must call.
-- Cole, the satelliettelefoon.

125
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:22,675
No, I have my own.
-- He has his own.

126
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,407
Just a damned James Bond.
-- You know James Bond?

127
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,649
Yes, I know him.
He dropped to his basic training.

128
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,675
I told HQ
I continued to phase two.

129
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,211
She said that the footprint faded.

130
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:45,791
So they called the hittespoor,
that was seen by the satellite.

131
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,279
Chief.

132
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:59,329
That was your death can be.
-- We should talk a change.

133
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,463
Let's important.

134
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:11,763
The orders are, in order to go behind Aban
Now we have new information.

135
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,980
Information?
That nonsense that Obi-Wan told?

136
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,830
We suspected that Aban in the mountains Saturday.
We had the first time here.

137
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,048
We talk about two, up to three days,
for me to help this man to find.

138
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:30,043
Excuse me, but I ga even this check.

139
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:35,189
If he once knew,
we have no choice.

140
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:44,052
Man, d'r is no place to shit.

141
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:47,372
Hey, did you have chocolate?

142
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,541
I've already given you everything yesterday.
I have old cigars.

143
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:57,088
Hearts and minds, man.
-- What you want to step into.

144
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,175
Sorry boys.

145
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,113
What does he here?

146
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:06,589
He offered to be our guide.
-- We are full, you see that?

147
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,442
Someone who knows the environment,
ensures that we can be much faster.

148
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:12,043
That snap me,
but here the stikt of the enemies.

149
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,937
The time we win,
We lost because we need him.

150
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:18,487
Listen, I fought with my father,
I can adapt itself to me.

151
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:22,830
Well, do our part but rations with him.

152
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,222
We're going.

153
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:49,507
Abdul, ga not those Americans.
It is not safe for you.

154
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:54,263
It will go pretty well mother.
I earn a lot of money for the family.

155
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,785
I forbid you, your grandfather forbids it.
Stay at home, your father would not find.

156
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:03,139
I earn ten times as much on the market,
Please mother, I must go.

157
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,479
It is my mother but, row on.

158
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,724
I'm back soon. Beware grandfather.

159
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:25,083
Wherever we go, says the technique little.
50 dollars to a man from here,

160
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,573
let millions of dollars a duration
GPS system undertaken,

161
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,642
if you outages,
or your battery dies.

162
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,228
There was too much at stake.

163
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:44,930
Chief, I know we have our orders,
but we are quite vulnerable here.

164
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,280
I also think it is nothing,
but I am the boss now.

165
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,783
For us that you did.

166
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:06,484
Everything here seems to me the same.

167
00:18:06,934 --> 00:18:09,861
At home, there is occasionally a pitch.

168
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:14,762
Cole where are you from?
-- Tampa, Florida, born and raised.

169
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:17,996
And you?
-- Chicago.

170
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:32,386
Stop.

171
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:38,947
What is he planning?
-- No idea.

172
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,503
We must continue.

173
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,607
What is the pe to do?

174
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,138
Why stop us on?

175
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,998
Therefore.
-- Potverdomme.

176
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:03,886
She said that this road was clean.
-- That was probably so ...

177
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:06,831
Look, you see that hole?

178
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:13,708
It looks like someone has dug.
-- That, I believe.

179
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:21,613
Good work Keynes.
You have saved us a bad day.

180
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:29,350
Let me guess,
we are going through that ravine.

181
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,396
Yes, that's right.

182
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:37,658
There are few places on earth,
as unforgivable as this desert.

183
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:41,331
Entire armies,
from those of Alexander to the Soviets,

184
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,797
The price paid
because they wanted to possess.

185
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,297
I hope that we are not so dumb.

186
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,948
That is wrong bunch.

187
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:36,791
It must be a trap.
-- Cole, back row.

188
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,981
Wait I look Ga.
-- No, do not.

189
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,921
Ski is concerned.

190
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:26,614
Let me take a look.
Chief, Ski severe bleeding.

191
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,834
Keep that for me, okay.

192
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:36,902
Chief, he was seriously injured.

193
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,307
Cole, come here to work there.

194
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:46,117
Reload, ga that direction,
and link those bastards.

195
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:47,829
Come.

196
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,197
Reload.

197
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,904
Walk through.

198
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,069
Pete, Keynes, deck them.
-- Okay.

199
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,654
Come.

200
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,905
I must try to close it.

201
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,088
Are you OK?

202
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,156
Check the RGP weft,
find out who that.

203
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:57,931
Is your friend's survival?

204
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,892
God has forgotten this place.

205
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:19,545
Are you sure that it was here?
-- Yes, the first here crept out the ditch.

206
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:22,845
Maybe you've only injured.
-- Certainly not.

207
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,439
I saw that they were hit.

208
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:28,178
That one was a hoofdschot,
the other in the chest.

209
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,537
I saw them neervallen.

210
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:34,137
Where are the bodies?
-- This is a good question.

211
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:37,837
Those guys do not know,
that they bring their dead.

212
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:41,384
I have you.

213
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,041
I have you.

214
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:06,261
Damn.

215
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:23,044
The heart was hit,
I could not stop the bleeding.

216
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,920
You did what you could,
we lay him in the truck, come.

217
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,952
The only dead in that battle,
There was one of us.

218
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,081
Incomprehensible.

219
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:05,308
As far as I know,
ghosts do not shoot with real bullets.

220
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,644
Hose 76, 76 snake.
This beast is 92.

221
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:17,253
I repeat,
92 beast requires to be picked up.

222
00:25:18,492 --> 00:25:20,567
With a gesneuvelde on.

223
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:24,990
How does it look like?

224
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,782
Not good, the radiator is concerned.

225
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,066
Can you fix it?
-- Maybe the small holes, not that great.

226
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:35,174
This is also affected.

227
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:43,429
Okay, Abdul says that there is a roadblock.
That leads us to the mountain.

228
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,979
That is a half-day
to our next checkpunt.

229
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:51,737
Item? Maybe you have not heard.
But we'll let us pick up.

230
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:59,647
Listen, I'm sorry, Trinoski,
but stop the mission, is not an option.

231
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:02,632
We have more than enough resources,
to achieve our object

232
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,082
Resources?
-- Hey, Wally.

233
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,837
Let Ski not have died for nothing.

234
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:11,537
If we stop now,
Ski has died for nothing.

235
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:20,195
Cole, change the message in supplies.

236
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,272
Hose 76, hose 76, 92 beast on.

237
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:32,305
The morale is low, understandable

238
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:38,125
We must remain concentrated,
these men have been trained.

239
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:42,934
They would rather die than last
chosen for a mission.

240
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:49,549
Where's that damned heli?
-- No idea, he had already contacted state.

241
00:26:54,473 --> 00:26:56,899
I hope that they are not shot,
on the other side of the valley,

242
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,599
where we ran in the fall.
-- That would kloten.

243
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:04,279
Wait, I hear him.

244
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,233
I hear nothing.

245
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,726
I have not imagined.

246
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,430
I see headlights.
At two hours.

247
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:34,047
It resembles a single vehicle.
And it is this side.

248
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:36,279
That's none of us,
who would no light at the time.

249
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,936
Hostile reinforcements presumably.
-- We must here.

250
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:43,774
Wait, they go out together.
-- What?

251
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,151
Did you do that.

252
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:52,777
What was that?

253
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:55,370
The Taliban have weapons.

254
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:59,800
Missiles maybe.
-- Whatever it was,

255
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,043
about an hour or two is the light,
We should work towards the other side of that mountain.

256
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:07,496
If we do, we find another
landingszone and ask where that bird is.

257
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:10,171
Come off.

258
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,090
They were down the lights, where Aban
it had when he contacted.

259
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,872
I knew now at least,
that we opgingen the right direction.

260
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:35,237
We had horses should take.
-- Since it is now too late.

261
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:42,386
Damn.
The engine is overheated.

262
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:46,666
These mountains make sure that he is ten times
to work harder than normal.

263
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:50,668
Stop here, he can cool down.

264
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,467
I open the bonnet,
he can ventilate.

265
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,467
How are we in time?

266
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:13,137
We must continue as we are opposed
the dark mountain like this.

267
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:18,428
Look, it's still a long way.
-- My kingdom for a few donkeys.

268
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,899
What has happened to him?

269
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,699
Have you seen anything?

270
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,876
We did not have to drive through the valley.

271
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:42,948
Our tracks are cleared.
-- What has happened to our reliable guide?

272
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,932
He's going to reisziek.

273
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:54,057
Chief, I do not have to deal with the satellite,
Mount creates interference.

274
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:56,267
I try after the pass again.

275
00:29:57,432 --> 00:30:00,368
If this bitch still somewhere to go,
there must be water.

276
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:02,768
What has happened to the water?

277
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,986
Anderhalve jerrycan.

278
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:15,954
Twins zandstormen, unusually,
but not God's work.

279
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,799
There is, is the real enemy.

280
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,249
There is overshadowing the truth
and that we can not use now.

281
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,818
Our water is low.

282
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:50,582
What was over, the truck went,
So now our drinkflessen empty.

283
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:54,366
I thought no supplies will be needed,
but we have no other choice.

284
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:02,936
Hose 76, response, beast 92.

285
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:11,332
It must be that rock,
I receive nothing.

286
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:17,707
It will not be long,
the weather is good.

287
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:22,148
When should his wife gave birth?

288
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:30,094
I thought sometime in January.

289
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:37,974
What will he do?

290
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:45,633
A strange moment,
to look at stars.

291
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:49,796
Maybe he wants the home front
a full moon in Afghanistan show.

292
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:04,875
Hearing you do that?

293
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,385
These begin.
-- Let's go.

294
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:36,502
See you what, chief?

295
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,437
No, not yet.

296
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:46,932
He sounds close.

297
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:50,455
Seek him, Cole.

298
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:57,108
Departure 01, 01 departure,
92 beast, radiocontrole.

299
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:07,049
Departure 01, note, I send you bad.
-- It is somewhere behind that ridge.

300
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:15,043
He is there somewhere, I believe.
-- That's because those rocky walls.

301
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:20,671
Departure 01, watch out, you are indiscernible,
repeat your last message.

302
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,221
Damn.

303
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,521
I think it is a form
of interference.

304
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,830
It sounds,
as if he is above us.

305
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:46,021
KT, shooting a torch.

306
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,506
What happened?

307
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:16,369
Departure 01, departing 01, 92 beast.

308
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,332
He may not have crashed,
than we had flames seen or heard something.

309
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:24,530
Departure 01, departing 01, 92 beast,
everything is okay?

310
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:27,279
Damn.

311
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,164
Why are they on our frequency?

312
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:34,291
I do not know.
-- What they say?

313
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:38,349
Abdul, you understand this?
-- No, I do not know.

314
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,744
That does not matter,
heli who was in the right place.

315
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:46,686
Yes, but he disappeared.
-- We do not know.

316
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:49,651
We must continue.
We set up a camp, on the mountain.

317
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,586
I thought not. How should we
Ski's body take in the dark.

318
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:57,700
We do not. We cover his body
and come back tomorrow morning.

319
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,215
I do not know boss.
-- What would you do?

320
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,850
We can not continue to wait for the bus.

321
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,187
We need that mountain
and a defensible position search.

322
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:11,640
If we encounter those bastards again,
I want to shoot down.

323
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:30,424
The team is confused,
though they did not matter.

324
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:35,644
It makes no sense to talk,
about something that you can not control.

325
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,999
That is impossible chief.

326
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:54,222
I've never made a mistake.
-- Why tell them that we were not there?

327
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:58,211
I do not know,
I've checked those numbers three times.

328
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:00,447
Someone has made a mistake.

329
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:06,134
Godverdomme.

330
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:11,172
Men, come take a look.

331
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,591
Who had the first watch?
-- I.

332
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,291
Do you have something seen or heard?
-- No, nothing.

333
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,298
I had the second wait,
I have not heard or seen.

334
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:31,065
This is a big mess, chief.
-- Someone wants us to graze.

335
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:37,853
Ga to the verstopplek and search Skis body.
Be careful and come back as soon as possible.

336
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:40,987
KT, I want
that we leave as soon as possible.

337
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:44,832
Abdul, you know where to find water here?
Now is the time was ripe.

338
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:48,087
Because if we find nothing within 24 hours,
we are thick in trouble.

339
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,696
Cursed wanted.

340
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:12,258
Come.

341
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,537
Sydney, this is box.

342
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:28,985
Sydney to box.

343
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:46,358
Chief, KT.

344
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:54,651
What do you feel?

345
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:02,268
What do you think it is?
-- I have no idea.

346
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:11,288
I do not think we want to know,
what's behind door number one. Wegwezen.

347
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,574
I have the feeling,
that they knew that we came.

348
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:18,147
Keynes, come.

349
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:36,706
The longer I'm here, the more convinced
I am, that I do not think the nuclear disappeared.

350
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:41,779
A voice in my head waiting out
to say, I said it anyway.

351
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,190
Everyone is drinking,
store still has no meaning.

352
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,507
Where does that well?

353
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:59,505
With these two peaks as a reference,
I would say about ten, twelve miles.

354
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:03,423
I hope you certainly know Abdul.
-- I'm sure.

355
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:07,060
It is a small oasis.
The farmers will share their animals water,

356
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,106
the highlands before they withdraw.

357
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,055
Look.

358
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:23,992
My compass says that this is the north,
but then the sun in the war.

359
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,939
I suspect that we are a
large magnetic field.

360
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,333
Maybe by the iron in the rocks.

361
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:32,618
And the satelliettelefoon?
-- Nothing.

362
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,004
Pete, what have you on your GPS?

363
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,207
Nothing.

364
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:45,886
Abdul, it seems,
you're the ball.

365
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,270
Pete, you lead.
-- Okay.

366
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:55,108
We're going.

367
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,008
These men will not admit,
Abdul but is now the most valuable man.

368
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,715
We had just as good
on another planet.

369
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,132
See you move?

370
00:40:25,692 --> 00:40:29,610
No.
-- Okay, we're going to check.

371
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:33,930
Chief, perhaps
a confrontation unwise.

372
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,830
We're going to kill terrorists,
everything else is detail.

373
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,162
Americans?

374
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:03,958
What he says?

375
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:11,465
I think, something that he is a warrior,
like you, but I can not do everything.

376
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,680
Kent Mohammed Aban he?

377
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,460
Thank him for the water.
We fill our veldflessen.

378
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:33,063
You see what he aanheeft under that mantle?

379
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:38,988
It seems a uniform. Of the Soviets?

380
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:45,437
No, British, of the 44 th regiment.

381
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:50,309
I wonder where he came.
-- The question is, when.

382
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:53,453
The 44 th regiment no longer exists.

383
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,902
The bones of hell. "
-- Where it all about?

384
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:03,039
In 1942 led the British
4500 man go here,

385
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,597
with women and children
and flight operators.

386
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:14,769
In 1944, according to legend
16000 people made the pass.

387
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:16,991
And only one came through it.

388
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,291
He said that he has borne witness,
a miracle of Satan.

389
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:24,358
It's just a legend.

390
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:28,271
Say you that this uniform on that unit?

391
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:33,391
I do not understand how it could be.
-- But the period is correct?

392
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,696
That's right.

393
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:41,041
I agree ga look deeper into the cave.

394
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:55,512
Aban talked about a guard,
would it be?

395
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,111
If so, whom he guarded?
Or what?

396
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:03,435
He sits in the middle of a 'hot' zone.

397
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:07,406
There is everywhere a low concentration of radiation.

398
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:21,006
He is in the vicinity,
I know that for sure.

399
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:24,873
The boys home,
want this fixed.

400
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:03,142
Griezelige mongrel.

401
00:45:08,887 --> 00:45:10,197
Christ.

402
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,907
Contact.

403
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:40,136
Shit.
Jesus Cole, you blew him into the sky.

404
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:44,199
Cole, what happened?

405
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,065
I will attackers.

406
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:53,318
Five, maybe six.
He seemed to talk with them here.

407
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,662
With their swords and pyjamas,
it seemed to wonder whether they came.

408
00:45:58,112 --> 00:46:04,157
Cole, tell me exactly what you saw.
-- I could see them with my night.

409
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:11,360
He spoke with that group
and they were armed, I swear it.

410
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,179
We can now do nothing.

411
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:16,131
He will have allies,
we have come here for that.

412
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:19,059
Let's go.

413
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:22,883
Cole bowl.

414
00:46:24,297 --> 00:46:29,297
You will not believe me anyway very much, eh?
-- Yes.

415
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:49,214
What are you doing now?
You can not let him.

416
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:51,886
Keynes, that rule.

417
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:56,364
Abdul we have here.
It is too dangerous.

418
00:46:55,293 --> 00:47:00,839
How could you do that?
You Americans killed him for nothing.

419
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:02,653
That we are not wanted,
it was an accident.

420
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,664
You have buried him,
Otherwise, the accident.

421
00:47:06,914 --> 00:47:10,502
Abdul, listen, we must go
there may be enemies in the vicinity.

422
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:12,762
Please, come along.

423
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:23,723
There is an uncertain silence cases
on the group, since we opbraken.

424
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:28,764
It is difficult to determine,
they are more worried,

425
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:31,714
about what Cole did,
or about what he saw.

426
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,396
Hey Pete, five-minute break.

427
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:02,121
Stitch, my stomach is upset.

428
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:08,079
Wipe off your face.
You're dehydrated.

429
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:12,063
Drink this.
-- Do not worry.

430
00:48:20,715 --> 00:48:24,591
What do you do well, it's not funny.
-- I have not done.

431
00:48:24,841 --> 00:48:30,154
I am filled with water last night.
-- Damn, man.

432
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:39,685
What happens here?

433
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,383
We have them refilled.

434
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:52,623
I tell you, that we are cursed.
-- Abdul bring us to the oasis.

435
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:03,289
Nobody would like to admit,
ie that might lose control.

436
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:06,875
But it is still difficult,
if you happen to everybody sees.

437
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:11,102
Damn, this thing is worthless.
He does not even looking.

438
00:49:13,947 --> 00:49:16,758
He is the kloten,
above, you should get a signal.

439
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:19,106
Is the battery destroyed?

440
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,947
There is something wrong.
-- What's Abdul?

441
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,765
This is wrong.
This valley I remember not.

442
00:49:49,015 --> 00:49:53,706
Make no jokes Abdul.
You said a source here.

443
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:56,704
Yes, but the path has changed.

444
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:03,002
What about now?

445
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:08,634
Abdul has been lost.
-- Why not surprise me.

446
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:17,801
This is the peak,
then we are here.

447
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:21,724
I can agree.

448
00:50:25,012 --> 00:50:27,147
Where is there than that?

449
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:33,095
State he was not on the map?
-- It is perhaps not 100%.

450
00:50:33,345 --> 00:50:36,312
But I do not believe,
that a whole piece of land they have missed.

451
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:40,925
I do not know.
I'm sorry.

452
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:43,422
You do not have him
pre-paid Keynes eh?

453
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:48,182
He is the forgotten.
-- Yes, but we still pay him as a guide?

454
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,070
Chief, perhaps the sunspots,
or a kind of interference.

455
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,671
That can take two days.
-- Sunspot do not sand in veldflessen.

456
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,512
Well, we need somewhere
Find a place to rest.

457
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:10,018
During walking is not good.
Let's go.

458
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:16,245
Maybe this is really necessary.

459
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:20,737
Completely lost touch
before you find what you are looking for.

460
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:40,845
Is it, buddy?
-- No, man.

461
00:51:42,495 --> 00:51:45,479
It feels as if something
from inside eats at me.

462
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:50,669
Can you give me my pills,
they sit front of my backpack.

463
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:53,119
This?

464
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:57,460
Do you think we are cursed?

465
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:09,614
Not smoking if you do not have water.
-- Adjust but, di's a 'waterzoek' cigar.

466
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:18,648
What are you doing,
movie you our downfall Keynes?

467
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:23,770
What do you mean sergeant,
you intend to stay here to die?

468
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:31,065
No soldier plant his death.

469
00:52:34,973 --> 00:52:41,882
It is what, in this godverlaten resort,
to work for the CIA.

470
00:52:45,751 --> 00:52:48,891
What is really our goal,
Keynes agent?

471
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:50,756
Or should I say,
what was our goal?

472
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:54,907
I am referring to the briefing explained.

473
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,557
Okay, so highly secret.

474
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:04,050
It must be very secret,
the CIA wants one of his own people send.

475
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,819
Usually you call it will pass through

476
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:11,114
and we support your back,
Cleaning up the mess?

477
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:15,453
I recognize covert operations.

478
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:20,438
So what the real mission is,
let it worth it.

479
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:26,655
You do not know what I'm with you, if I discover
Ski that died for your salary.

480
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,491
He died for his country and not for me.

481
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:35,832
McCarthy, calm to size,
we are all in the same boat.

482
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:41,782
How do you find that you can always
on the support of an Aussie.

483
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:32,464
Wake up.

484
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:39,444
Ga of myself.

485
00:54:41,674 --> 00:54:43,517
He dreams.

486
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,232
Is everything okay?

487
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,586
Ga.

488
00:54:59,586 --> 00:55:00,951
They called again.
-- Really?

489
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:04,059
Yes, I'm okay.
-- Cole, care for him.

490
00:55:06,925 --> 00:55:12,590
Have you dysentery?
-- No, I had already ondergescheten.

491
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:16,451
If you have something to add,
it is now time for this.

492
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:19,662
I'm just as thirsty as you chief.

493
00:55:22,037 --> 00:55:24,227
Perhaps it is this cursed place.

494
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:28,440
Find coverage.

495
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:33,452
Loop.

496
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:40,262
What's that on?

497
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:49,092
Too high for a truck.
-- Too quiet for a helicopter.

498
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:53,778
Where does he go?

499
00:55:54,228 --> 00:56:00,836
I see no enemies. Take Cole mee
and see what is going on.

500
00:56:01,086 --> 00:56:02,386
Ok.

501
00:56:08,043 --> 00:56:13,324
Pete, ensure coverage in the back.
-- Okay, understood.

502
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:19,004
Please note.
Now.

503
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:53,580
Stop with fire.

504
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,838
Everyone remains in coverage.

505
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,680
Did you Chief?

506
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:13,170
That voice in my head was there again

507
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,563
and now was more important
than all the documents together.

508
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:20,213
The bones of hell '
was the story of one man.

509
00:57:20,879 --> 00:57:24,715
But we will find evidence.
-- Chief.

510
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:33,464
Look.
-- Jesus is that all that's left?

511
00:57:37,677 --> 00:57:41,867
What do you think it was?
-- I'm not sure.

512
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,341
Certainly something,
that we have never seen.

513
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:53,974
The Taliban have no such thing,
perhaps the Soviets, something experimental.

514
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,936
Chief, we need here.
The camp reopening,

515
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:06,385
they come back down.

516
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,966
If we do not quickly find water,
it makes no difference.

517
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,882
Hey.
-- Hello.

518
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:48,579
We must continue. Can you walk?
-- Yes, it does so.

519
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:55,471
From him I do not know.
-- Abdul, we should go.

520
00:58:58,396 --> 00:58:59,959
Damn.

521
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:07,187
Have you not heard me Abdul?
I said that we leave.

522
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:12,358
We will die,
my grandfather was right.

523
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:16,391
We never had to come from.
-- Since it is now too late.

524
00:59:16,641 --> 00:59:20,116
Pack your belongings and ga.
-- I ga not with you.

525
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:24,323
Do not be dumb Abdul, if you leave us,
you will die.

526
00:59:24,573 --> 00:59:27,812
We are already dead.
-- I am here spuugzat.

527
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:32,774
So you might think,
but I do not want in my team.

528
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:38,289
What is happening?
-- I spoke with your husband, Keynes.

529
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:40,224
He said ...
-- Abdul, no.

530
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:51,585
Wacky bastard.

531
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:56,892
He did not much for us.
-- We had him.

532
00:59:57,142 --> 01:00:00,905
What? He led us ...
-- I tell you, we had him.

533
01:00:01,155 --> 01:00:04,028
Certainly not to find water.
Or perhaps Aban?

534
01:00:04,278 --> 01:00:05,579
There is more.

535
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:07,816
Tell us damn,
what that means more?

536
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:11,533
I tell only what you need to know, chief.
-- Make a joke.

537
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:13,565
Who is there now know more than we do?

538
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:18,420
He bastard, I lost all three men
during this damned quest of you.

539
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:21,036
And now let me know what this is all about.

540
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:24,731
Tell us what is going on.
What was that thing last night.

541
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:27,310
We do not know.
-- We?

542
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,209
You and those lulletjes in Langley?
-- Listen ... Chief,

543
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:37,907
all I can say is that I work
for a special department within the CIA.

544
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:41,368
Wonderful as that.
We are here to die,

545
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:45,249
while you are on spokenjacht?
I personally shoot a bullet in you.

546
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:49,410
We have orders to follow chief.
-- Perhaps you know it yet,

547
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,956
but dead men do not follow orders.

548
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:16,214
I want to tell them,
I realize that I must tell.

549
01:01:17,214 --> 01:01:20,204
In my head I browse all protocols,
all secrets

550
01:01:20,454 --> 01:01:25,245
and wonder, what is the point of
death to go, that everything in my head?

551
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:29,695
What will they do,
with the information I send them?

552
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,916
Mohammed Aban know.
He knew the whole time.

553
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:37,172
But he still alive?

554
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:17,399
Keynes, what is there?

555
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:53,061
What is there, you saw something?

556
01:02:56,585 --> 01:02:59,359
I saw Mohammed Aban.
-- Do you love me for a ride?

557
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,954
Look.

558
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,132
What's that damn thing for?
-- No idea.

559
01:03:07,182 --> 01:03:11,867
But I think that this is your chief men killed.
Here I was looking for.

560
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:14,566
That is why I am here.

561
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:19,201
I do not, it is a weapon?
-- We do not know.

562
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:21,863
Something of the Soviets?

563
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:25,971
We can not fight against,
if you do not say what it is.

564
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:37,484
Okay, sergeant.
Get your men.

565
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,628
How long do you know this already?

566
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:51,810
Since the tachtigerjaren,
when we Moedjahadin trained.

567
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:59,682
We tried to use this area,
to trainingkampen there.

568
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:02,734
But we discovered,
that everything here was dead.

569
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:06,276
What do you mean by death?
-- Nothing worked.

570
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:11,849
Radios, compasses, nothing that
with electromagnetic radiation.

571
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:18,434
So my group began an investigation.

572
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:24,754
In 2000 we saw something,
an image.

573
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:29,178
A satellite image.
-- What you saw?

574
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:36,852
Have you ever heard of the Vimanas?
-- No, never.

575
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:43,402
I very much, they occur in the Asian foklore,
in particular in India.

576
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:50,585
A kind of UFO, but then triangular.

577
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:54,804
Alexander the Great wrote,
that his troops attacked them.

578
01:04:55,054 --> 01:04:59,735
He called them "flying shields."
-- So this is a damned UFO hunt.

579
01:04:59,985 --> 01:05:05,398
No chief, it was identified.
There is evidence.

580
01:05:06,248 --> 01:05:09,174
We believe that it is a weapon,
with unprecedented force.

581
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:11,654
And why were you and your men selected.

582
01:05:11,904 --> 01:05:15,172
What does it matter if we find that thing
while dying?

583
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:18,687
Not just research, eh?

584
01:05:20,402 --> 01:05:25,297
Listen, this is my connection
with the outside world.

585
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:30,606
Your camera?
What are you talking about Keynes?

586
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:37,580
I have forwarded optical images,
laserverbinding through this.

587
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,319
Great.
-- And that you tell us now pas?

588
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:48,000
So your people follow us all the time al
They know where we are today.

589
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,168
This is the only way,
to collect irrefutable evidence.

590
01:05:52,568 --> 01:05:55,732
We did not know,
whether anyone would return.

591
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:59,883
This is insane.
-- This is a damned suicidal.

592
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:03,820
There is a huge difference,
between suicide and sacrifice.

593
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,718
Precisely, this is the difference,
you bastard.

594
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:11,698
This is larger than ourselves together,
So calm.

595
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:14,983
I would suggest you should neerknallen,
for what you aandeed my men.

596
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:18,788
Your men were patriots chief.
-- Those were my friends.

597
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:20,392
I understand that.

598
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,365
That is enough.

599
01:06:57,195 --> 01:07:00,974
So do not go chief.
I'm not the enemy.

600
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:04,474
That would be just as well you can.

601
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:13,325
I'm sorry sergeant.

602
01:07:24,351 --> 01:07:26,995
I am prepared to die for my country,
but this ...

603
01:07:27,345 --> 01:07:29,441
I do not know whether this is life or death.

604
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:33,001
Maybe there is something in between.

605
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:45,598
Keynes is awake.
-- What is happening?

606
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:50,673
The Chief is gone.
-- How long already?

607
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:55,735
No idea, he left his gun behind,
I do not know why.

608
01:08:55,985 --> 01:08:58,285
We must adopt
that he did not return.

609
01:08:59,012 --> 01:09:03,487
What's new with Degetau?
-- Not very well.

610
01:09:04,637 --> 01:09:09,045
Can you do not pass through your connection,
that they should come and collect him?

611
01:09:10,445 --> 01:09:13,476
They will not come.
-- Look at him.

612
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:18,896
He is not useful for the mission.
-- We are the mission, sergeant.

613
01:09:19,146 --> 01:09:22,712
See you do not,
Our goal is to find the Vimanas,

614
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:26,225
their goal is to see what happens,
if we succeed.

615
01:09:26,475 --> 01:09:30,176
The end justifies the means.
-- That is the problem, eh?

616
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:32,899
We seem never to reach the end.

617
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,349
We must continue.

618
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:39,162
Is that what I think it is?
-- They are the bones of hell. "

619
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,722
Unbelievable.

620
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:47,063
It seems that we are in hell.
-- Near in any case.

621
01:10:56,642 --> 01:10:59,884
I have no doubt that this is the
print, which we saw from space.

622
01:11:00,134 --> 01:11:03,345
The fate of humanity,
displayed here for us.

623
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:08,965
Is this a message, a warning?
Am I the messenger?

624
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:20,852
What is happening?
-- Watch.

625
01:11:28,155 --> 01:11:31,146
My God.
They are the.

626
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:42,645
My God, get me here.

627
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,752
How should we fight against something?

628
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:10,505
Then we do not.

629
01:12:33,527 --> 01:12:35,603
I must go, okay?

630
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:38,253
For it is too dark.

631
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,856
Are you too late for a meeting?

632
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:04,584
Klootzak.

633
01:13:06,934 --> 01:13:11,960
I can not bear.
-- Then you had better go.

634
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:21,014
You're a good soldier.
Your country will be proud.

635
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,195
My country will never know who I am.

636
01:13:28,942 --> 01:13:30,398
Goodbye.

637
01:13:56,156 --> 01:13:58,703
Something tells me that I should proceed.

638
01:13:58,953 --> 01:14:01,319
In order to search for water, or anything else.

639
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:03,947
I'm really not anymore.

640
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:08,977
I seem to know the direction,
but not the destination.

641
01:14:10,515 --> 01:14:15,660
Am I being led, or is it a tragic
to attempt to die with dignity.

642
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:19,707
Is there any dignity?

643
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:57,776
Ga to your God, as a soldier.

644
01:21:42,615 --> 01:21:44,521
It will save us all.

645
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:02,005
Stacey Okay, let's get started,
when your man departed.

646
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:05,642
Can you tell us something about his mission?

647
01:22:08,204 --> 01:22:14,632
It is almost a year,
in november.

648
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:21,334
He did not speak much about his mission,
because he works for the CIA.

649
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:30,329
But I know he was in Afghanistan
and a special someone was looking for.

650
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:34,418
Your husband worked in a special group
within the CIA, is that correct?

651
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,571
Yes, that's what he told me.

652
01:22:37,821 --> 01:22:41,391
You know whether there is still more of that group
disappeared?

653
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:46,905
I know that he would take a team

654
01:22:47,155 --> 01:22:50,905
and that they would help him
Mohammed search,

655
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:54,418
but I do not know who they are.

656
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,282
Nobody seems to know something.

657
01:22:59,086 --> 01:23:03,453
I do not,
they can still remember him?

658
01:23:03,703 --> 01:23:06,916
He devoted his life to his country.

659
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:12,188
That diary you have there,
is that the only evidence from that period?

660
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:20,095
It was me a few weeks
After his departure sent.

661
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:26,120
I know it is him.
I recognize his handwriting, despite the codes.

662
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:31,470
I just want to know whether he is still alive.
