1
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,647
Luke!!!

2
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,491
Luke!

3
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,655
Luke!!!

4
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:38,949
Luke!!

5
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,718
Luke!!!

6
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,192
A werewolf!

7
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,965
An aristocrat!

8
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,393
You must be a wandering hunter?!

9
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,837
You can talk, can't you?

10
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,846
Is that sword just for show?

11
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,678
Can I take it?

12
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,549
Good defense!

13
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,642
You're not as good as I thought!!

14
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,076
Now, leave the sword
you have on your back and go!

15
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,156
Wait! You're a hunter just like
I thought, and...you must be...

16
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,096
...a vampire hunter!!

17
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:35,369
Am I right? I'm sorry.
I apologize for my rudeness.

18
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,269
I wanted to test your skill.

19
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,571
I...I will hire you!!

20
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,011
I need you!!

21
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,482
L...Look at this!

22
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,688
The kiss mark from a Count.

23
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,440
What is your name?

24
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,672
Doris Ran.
Can you take this job?

25
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,182
I will pay you any reward.

26
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,213
T. ..three meals a day, and...

27
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,886
you can sleep with me too.

28
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,086
When did the Count attack you?

29
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,658
Are you taking my offer?!

30
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,326
Damn!

31
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,235
Sister!

32
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:14,703
Dan!

33
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,874
I'll board it for you.

34
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,180
Wow!
This is a DL4 model cyborg horse!

35
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,852
Hey you don't talk much, do you?

36
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:37,353
Dr. Felingo said
there are 2 types of quiet men.

37
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,658
Those who are always thinking
about something bad, and...

38
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,168
those with experience,
who don't say unnecessary things.

39
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,768
I think you are the second one.

40
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,300
Because you look really cool!

41
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,160
Hey, Doris!

42
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:51,996
Greco...

43
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,541
I guess the rumors are true.

44
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:57,835
W...what are you talking about?

45
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,273
Well I want to talk to you about that.

46
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,251
What do you want to talk about?

47
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,732
Let's see...the story that
you were attacked by the Count.

48
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,131
I don't know what do you mean!

49
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,130
Hey, hey, don't raise your voice.

50
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,234
Don't you care if your
brother hears about that?

51
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:33,169
Well, Doris, why didn't
you tell me about this?

52
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,974
I'm the Mayor's son in this village.

53
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,943
I can hire as many
hunters as you want.

54
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,544
Much better than the one you hired.

55
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,910
How's that?

56
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,284
I will even forget
about what you did to me.

57
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,259
So why don't
you just do what I say.

58
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,358
W...what the hell?!
That hurts... !

59
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,333
Don't get fresh with me!

60
00:13:55,368 --> 00:14:01,796
Doris, I'm worried about you.
I'm trying to help you.

61
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,808
Don't even think you
can demand my gratitude!

62
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,673
I know so many people who've had
awful experiences with you!

63
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,874
You're cute when you're angry...

64
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,886
but totally unruly.

65
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,478
Now be mature and do as I say.

66
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,451
You bitch!
Don't think that I'm so easy!

67
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:37,670
B...Boss...

68
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:42,281
Hey, everybody! Listen to this!
Doris was attacked by the Count!

69
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,215
The vampire bit her!

70
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,081
That's why she hired the hunter!

71
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,223
Sister!!

72
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,938
Then you are a hunter?

73
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,273
Yes.

74
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,245
Doris...you...?

75
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:26,959
Sister...

76
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,225
I knew I was right.

77
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,760
No! My sister was never
attacked by the Count.

78
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,790
Loser!
Just because she turned you down.

79
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,395
W...w...what?!

80
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,027
You little brat!

81
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:38,993
Greco!

82
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:39,936
But, father!

83
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,997
They're making a fool out of me!

84
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,267
We are talking about an important
issue in the village right now.

85
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,435
Go some place else!

86
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,442
Damn!!

87
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,143
Anyway, we can't let you loose
since you were bitten by the vampire.

88
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,081
I have to send you to the asylum.

89
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:53,982
Sheriff!

90
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,652
Stop it!

91
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,417
I won't let you take
my sister anywhere!

92
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,416
Wait a minute, Sheriff.

93
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,093
That asylum is no place
for humans to live.

94
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,993
That place is worse than a pigsty.
As a doctor, I absolutely object!

95
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,267
Besides, that place has been
abandoned for more than 50 years.

96
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,530
I can't make any exceptions, Doctor.
It's the law of this village.

97
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,434
Roman, don't you
remember what happened ...

98
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,340
when we used
that place 50 years ago?

99
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,971
What happened 50 years ago?

100
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,083
There was a woman who was
attacked by a Count, like Doris.

101
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,485
We locked her in the asylum,
but it evoked the Count's rage...

102
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,581
and 30 villagers were
brutally murdered.

103
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,326
What happened to that woman?

104
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,460
She became insane
and died in the asylum.

105
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,636
Can you hold off Doris' punishment
until I finish my assignment?

106
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,073
What?

107
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,278
Y...you look very confident
but...you must deal with vampires.

108
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,878
If you fail...

109
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,983
If he fails, I will kill myself!

110
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,555
Sister!

111
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,171
Dan, listen to me carefully.

112
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,542
Welcome...

113
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,812
Can I have one month's
worth of fertilizer,...

114
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:30,507
and five packs of dried meat,
also some can foods?

115
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,416
Sorry, but all are sold out.

116
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:35,745
Mr. Weitory!

117
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,683
Weitory! What're you talking about?
You have plenty of stock here.

118
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,795
Doctor! All my other
customers have run away.

119
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,497
I can't sell anything to
the friends of a vampire!

120
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:48,764
What?!

121
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,394
Things will be
harder from now on.

122
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:57,132
Dan, you can cry as
much as you want...

123
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,135
but, don't ever
let your sister cry.

124
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,614
If you think your tears
will make your sister cry...

125
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,547
then you should hold them back.

126
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,343
No matter how difficult, you should
smile and encourage your sister.

127
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,812
You have to be a man now.

128
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:12,880
Do you understand?

129
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,481
What is the matter with you today?
You're acting strangely.

130
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,041
Protecting the girl,
and encouraging her brother...

131
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,579
I don't know what's got into you.

132
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,517
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with that girl.

133
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,286
Don't be silly!

134
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,554
That's it, isn't it?

135
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,760
Although she offered you her body,
I don't think that's what you want.

136
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,959
Your only interest
has been hunting aristocrats.

137
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,639
A bloody life,
that's been your destiny.

138
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,203
Perhaps now, you long for
the love of a human being?

139
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,869
It can never be...
a man like you...

140
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,711
Oops...

141
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,280
Thank you for this afternoon.
You must have told Dan something?

142
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,577
He keeps trying to encourage me.

143
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,792
My father was a hunter too,
a Werewolf hunter.

144
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,055
But he didn't know
anything about aristocrats.

145
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,423
"You should only ask
vampire hunters about aristocrats."

146
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,563
"The other hunters
have no knowledge of them. "

147
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,159
My father always said that.

148
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,101
D, please tell me more about them.

149
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,132
Tomorrow is the "Moon of Woman".

150
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:10,903
"Moon of Woman"?

151
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,205
Is that when the red moon
comes out once every month?

152
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,180
Aristocrats detest biting for blood
on that night...

153
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,273
because they believe this moon
causes the flow of impure blood.

154
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,683
This means some messenger from the
castle may come tonight to take you.

155
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,984
Who is the Count that lives there?

156
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,622
His name is Count Lee.

157
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,659
He's been ruling this land
long before our village established.

158
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,018
He had disappeared
for a long time, but...

159
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,326
his castle lit up two years ago,
and we realized he had come back.

160
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,268
He supposed be five thousand
to ten thousand years old.

161
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,498
He must be incredibly old anyway.

162
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,236
Ten thousand years old...
he could be a difficult enemy.

163
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,479
Here they come.

164
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,790
How do you want to fight?
I'll fight with you.

165
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,932
You can't beat them
with a cross or garlic.

166
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,537
They keep mutants and werewolves
for fighting.

167
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,547
I guess you hired a bodyguard.

168
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,981
A cheap idea that only
low class humans would think of.

169
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,056
A woman...?
What happened to the Count?

170
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:48,864
My father told me that this girl
is unusually beautiful,...

171
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,767
for a human in this village, and her
blood is extremely tasty and mild.

172
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,499
So I came to look at her.

173
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,675
But she is a fool and not
worthy of our clan.

174
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,836
She forgets that we are the rulers
by acting against us impertinently.

175
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,244
It can not be forgiven!

176
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,616
I will kill you in the
bloodiest way first...

177
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,241
and then destroy this girl slowly.

178
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,745
As you wish.

179
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,983
I'm Ray Ginsay.

180
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,987
My job is to destroy humans like you.

181
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,458
Prepare to die!

182
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,980
You are much more than I expected.

183
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,489
Then I will have to be more serious too.

184
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,458
Uh...I see...

185
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,533
I've heard about a mutant
who can warp space...

186
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,459
Is that you?

187
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,173
Too bad for you!
Now, I will take your head.

188
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,381
Y...you bastard!

189
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,317
Well.

190
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,546
This man is a dampiel.

191
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,390
Ray, I will take care of him.

192
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,587
But...Countess...

193
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,491
Get back!

194
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,900
I understand...Countess...

195
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,666
A dampiel?
This is the first time I've met one.

196
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,831
Some Count must've had fun.

197
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,569
You are the evil consequence of
a low class woman and a Count!

198
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,441
You are worse than human!

199
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:18,315
Girl, my business is with the Count.

200
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,315
I don't want to have to kill you.

201
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:25,687
Shut up! You, a dampiel,
think you can beat me?!

202
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,231
Go back to the castle,
and tell the Count...

203
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,066
the destiny of a transient visitor
is going back to the darkness.

204
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,267
A transient visitor?

205
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,686
Have Ramica and the others returned?

206
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,092
They took action selfishly,
without asking my permission...

207
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,966
I will think about
their punishment later.

208
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,797
What...a Dampiel?

209
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,577
You say Ramica and Ray
were forced to retreat by a Dampiel?

210
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:25,880
Interesting,
one more thing for my enjoyment.

211
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,023
Ancestor God, Count Dracula!

212
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,456
My father is wrong.

213
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:41,021
He is trying to invite a low class
girl into our noble Lee family.

214
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,431
I can't let him foolishly...

215
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,198
I can't let him foolishly...

216
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,545
Lady Ramica,
please go back to your room.

217
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:57,113
I have no reason
to listen to your orders.

218
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,282
The Count scolded me
for what we did tonight.

219
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,317
He ordered that you
should not leave your room.

220
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,056
Now, come with me.

221
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:07,953
Ray!

222
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,950
Don't ever touch me again!

223
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,630
Well, you seem to be
ingratiating yourself with my father...

224
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,927
to join the Count's family.

225
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,090
But you can't change
your low class identity.

226
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,665
A person who has
such disgusting blood...

227
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:22,468
should never join our family.
I will never let that happen!

228
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,931
D, watch out...it's a trap!

229
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,492
I know.

230
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,417
A phantom beast!

231
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,594
Over there?!

232
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,685
We meet again.

233
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:10,361
Well, you dodged my Jagar boy,
and you still have an arm.

234
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,430
You truly are a dampiel.

235
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,076
I want to continue the fight
from yesterday, right now.

236
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,175
But I have to guide you
somewhere by the Count's order.

237
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,558
I told you this was a trap.

238
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:22,669
This is the aftermath of a war
that took place ten thousand years ago.

239
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,242
This is a really
telling view of that world.

240
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,636
Who are you?

241
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,672
Who are you?

242
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,267
Why don't you answer?

243
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,146
Why don't you answer?

244
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,276
Who are you three?

245
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,574
We are...

246
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,849
We are...

247
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,421
This kind!

248
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,029
Y...you!

249
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,676
We are the famous
Snake Women of Midwitch!

250
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,449
Big sister, we haven't had
fresh prey for a long time.

251
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,581
Let's enjoy sucking this man's energy.

252
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:56,385
Sure! We'll all take his life energy,
down to the marrow in his bones.

253
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:21,249
Doris, don't worry. He'll come back.
He looked like a man made from steel.

254
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,380
He won't die so easily.

255
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,421
Doris...are you in love with him?!

256
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,359
That's not a good idea!

257
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,727
He is not the kind
of man you think he is.

258
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,795
He may not be a bad person,
but he has dangerous eyes.

259
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,430
Dangerous eyes?

260
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:42,996
Eyes that went through
so many dangerous battles.

261
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,269
He is not the kind of
man who will accept you.

262
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,299
Well, lady, the Count
has been waiting for you.

263
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,936
Let Dan and Dr. Felingo go!!

264
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,646
Too bad!
Fresh meat is their favorite!

265
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,682
I...if you do that,
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

266
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:36,154
The Count ordered me
to bring you without injury.

267
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,319
I guess I have no choice.

268
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,722
Put your tongue back inside
your mouth. It's bad manners.

269
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:53,203
Well Doris, tomorrow, you can
finally join an aristocrat's family.

270
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,711
So why don't you stop bluffing?

271
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,511
You'll see!

272
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,845
I will get out from this
musty castle tonight!

273
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,047
You are cute.
You will become my wife soon...

274
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,422
so I will forgive your impudence,
for now.

275
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:15,032
By the way, Doris, you seem to
think that hunter will rescue you.

276
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,847
D!!

277
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,408
Those snake women are
sucking out all his energy.

278
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,817
Look at them.
They are in the height of pleasure.

279
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,847
They have been intoxicated
by his worthless pleasure...

280
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,358
for more than half the day.

281
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,388
A normal man would
have died in five minutes.

282
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,124
But it's no wonder,
since he is a dampiel

283
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,657
Dampiel?!

284
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,800
Are you saying D is a dampiel?

285
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,371
Oh, didn't you know that?

286
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,037
Our aristocrats have slept with
lower class women for fun.

287
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,869
He was born of mixed blood.

288
00:37:59,244 --> 00:37:59,676
What's wrong?

289
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,677
Doris, look at them well.
Don't you think it's exciting?

290
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,013
No! Stop it!

291
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:10,447
All right! You better go to your
bedroom and rest well tonight.

292
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,064
Tomorrow is our wedding...
my dear Doris...

293
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,995
Tonight it seems that
even the moon is jealous of me.

294
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:42,416
What kind of man is he?
He is overwhelming us.

295
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,582
Really overwhelming us.

296
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,630
Oh no?! He's...?!

297
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,221
Is my father trying to invite
this woman into the Lee family?

298
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,654
This woman will
become my mother?

299
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,414
Like father, like son...

300
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,387
No matter how much you reject it,
you'll bare your fangs anyway.

301
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,455
Shut up.

302
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,258
Are you angry again?
This is your destiny.

303
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,284
There is nothing you
can do about it.

304
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,956
Damn you!
Do you want me to cut you off?

305
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,999
All right...I won't talk anymore.

306
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,361
What part of her is
my father so attracted to?

307
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,840
I'll never let you join the Lee family.
I, Ramica, will never accept it!

308
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:17,347
Bastard?!

309
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,417
Gorem!

310
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,339
Gorem!

311
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:19,560
I've got you!

312
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:31,766
Gimlet!

313
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:40,877
I can't go back into the
castle, until I kill him.

314
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,257
Sister.

315
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:53,423
Sister!

316
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,998
D...Dan. Where is D?

317
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:01,599
He is fixing the wall outside.

318
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,032
By the way,
I think he's really strong.

319
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:08,570
He rescued you all by himself
from such a horrible place.

320
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:13,043
Besides, he didn't even
rest after he came back.

321
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,779
He started working
to fix the wall, right away.

322
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,255
It's the aristocrat!

323
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:19,848
It's the aristocrat's carriage!

324
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:21,050
Why are they here?

325
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,823
What is wrong with you?

326
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:28,728
Let's go inside
the hotel and drink more.

327
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,762
You go home now!

328
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,727
What's going on?

329
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,530
Hey, old man!

330
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,676
A messenger
from the aristocrat is here.

331
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,505
I know! Give me
the key to the monitor room!

332
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:47,042
The Count has sent me.

333
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:51,344
What do you want?
Did he tell you to execute me?

334
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:57,822
No, that's absurd. You think
I can beat you with my skill?

335
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:04,362
Impudence is rewarded with death.
That's the law to protect the castle.

336
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:14,768
The Count wants
you to use this to kill him.

337
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,277
Could this be
the Incense of Time Trap.

338
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,752
Indeed.

339
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,446
Incense of Time Trap?

340
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,466
D!! Did you find Dan?

341
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,372
Dan was kidnapped.

342
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,697
That's Dan's gun!

343
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:48,206
I'm the one they want to take.
Why did they take my brother?

344
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,711
What does it say?
Let me see!

345
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:51,709
What is this?!

346
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:57,153
Don't bother. This is a language
only understood between assassins.

347
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,853
It says, if I want to save Dan's life,
I have to go over there by myself.

348
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:04,017
They are trying to separate us.

349
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,554
Why Dan?
Why not just tell me to go over there?

350
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:11,829
Because, the person who wrote this
letter wants to conclude the battle.

351
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:17,474
And if he used the boy to get you, it
would stain the aristocrat's honor.

352
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:19,939
Screw the aristocrat's honor!

353
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,912
Aristocrats are all
monsters who suck human blood.

354
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,772
I...I'm sorry.

355
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:31,647
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you know I'm a dampiel?

356
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,059
My blood is mixed with
the aristocrats whom you hate.

357
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,327
I understand.

358
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,920
You didn't tell us because you
didn't want us to worry unnecessarily.

359
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,667
It's better that I didn't know.

360
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,401
You made it.

361
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,634
What did you do with Dan?

362
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,205
Brother D!

363
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,209
Help me!!!

364
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:04,313
Little boy! I will get you down
after I kill this man.

365
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:06,114
Why don't you be quiet and wait there.

366
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:11,823
Brother D, I'm scared!!!

367
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:12,657
You bastard!

368
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:14,895
Now, let's begin.

369
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,584
D Watch out! This smells of
the Incense of Time Trap.

370
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,344
It...it wont light!

371
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,698
Dan, Dan, please come back safe.

372
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,736
If you die...

373
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,300
Doris, it's me. Felingo!

374
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,339
Doctor!!

375
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,204
Doris, can you turn off
the switch for the barrier.

376
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:00,701
Doctor!!

377
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,513
Doctor, Doctor!
Dan was...Dan was...

378
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,242
I had to take care of
an emergency patient.

379
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:10,146
I'm sorry for being late.
Come with me right now.

380
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,422
I don't know why you and Dan
have to go through this difficulty.

381
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:19,561
My hand!
Somebody cheated me!

382
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,531
You've got fake incense.
You must have been set up.

383
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,331
Now throw away your
worthless ambition.

384
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:28,804
Bastard!
You'll never understand my feelings!

385
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,712
Doctor, is there really such a place?

386
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,871
I found it in the Northern forest.

387
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:41,316
I passed it when I was on my
way back from Mr. Parker's.

388
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:44,615
It's an ancient building with
some engravings on it's walls.

389
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:48,955
Later, I found out it's a building
that blocks the power of vampires.

390
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:54,760
We'll be safe there
and that man will rescue Dan.

391
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:55,760
You're right!

392
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:07,904
The Count's daughter!

393
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:09,674
Whoa, whoa!

394
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,380
Doris, turn us around!

395
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,380
There's no room here!

396
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,973
I'll take care of her!

397
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,084
Doctor!! Dr. Felingo!!

398
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,026
That was...

399
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,059
my name...

400
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,654
until yesterday!

401
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,532
Doctor! Doctor!! No!!!

402
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,767
No...Doctor...
not you too?

403
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:35,967
Hey!

404
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,475
Lady Ramica, why are you here?

405
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,470
The Count's plan was for me
to take her to the castle.

406
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,974
Get her down.

407
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:44,772
Yes.

408
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,617
I have always thought
of this girl as my daughter.

409
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,884
But seeing her now,
she is really beautiful...

410
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:54,788
and I wonder why
I never raped her.

411
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,751
The Count really has good taste.

412
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:03,798
In truth, I want to ask the Count
to share her leftover blood with me.

413
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,232
Hey, cretin!

414
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,098
Doctor!!

415
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,601
D...Doris?

416
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,570
D...Doctor!!

417
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:21,342
Doctor...

418
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,618
This is hopeless!
He and Dan might be already...

419
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:28,790
He...you mean that dampiel?

420
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:33,460
I would rather die than
become an aristocrat.

421
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,729
Everything is my father's fault.

422
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,901
This is pointless. Just go
where my father can't find you.

423
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:58,787
You?!

424
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,194
Greco?!

425
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,764
It really works...

426
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:16,131
this Incense of Time Trap.

427
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:21,639
It's supposed to blind vampires,
but it really makes them suffer.

428
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,537
What are you doing with that thing?

429
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,812
What's important is we have
the Count's daughter as our hostage.

430
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:30,354
Everything will be fine if we
can make a deal with the Count.

431
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:31,879
Your planning to...

432
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:34,550
lure the Count out, and take his life.

433
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,155
This Incense of Time Trap
will do the job easily.

434
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,363
But I have one condition.
You must promise to marry me.

435
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:41,594
Greco...?!

436
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:44,058
If you say no,
I'll just leave now.

437
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,431
If you marry me,
we can get the Count's treasure...

438
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,062
and control the village, too.

439
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:49,771
Stop it! It hurt my eyes.

440
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,103
You don't look so well, Doris?

441
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,636
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you from now on.

442
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:00,105
Well, she's good looking when
I see her face close up.

443
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,618
I thought vampire girls
looked like monsters.

444
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,945
Kill me! Right here...right now!

445
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,358
You still have strength to be snooty?

446
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:15,363
Kill me now! I'd rather die than be
captured by lowly creatures like you!

447
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,090
What? You little brat!

448
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:21,693
Kill me! If you don't kill me now,
I will surely kill you later!

449
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,533
All right! I will give you death!

450
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,508
Even if I kill you,
I can still lure the Count out!

451
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:28,902
Stop doing that!
She can't even fight back!!

452
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:30,512
She said I'm a lowly creature!

453
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:31,710
Doris!?

454
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,186
Sister!

455
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,090
Dan? Is that you?

456
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:42,786
Sister, are you all right?

457
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,692
Dan, you're still alive!

458
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:45,591
Dan!

459
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,162
I see.
The Doctor...

460
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,961
I thought you were dead.

461
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,303
I didn't care if I died, too.

462
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,632
Sister, you should be stronger!

463
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,341
Brother D said we
should never give up!

464
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,640
Dan...you are...

465
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,487
Go back to your castle,
it's not far from here.

466
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:16,791
You're not going to kill me?

467
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,225
Of course not, why should we
act like cowards who kill women!

468
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,925
I'll tell you why he is helping you.

469
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,165
You see...

470
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:29,670
he wouldn't allow anyone helpless
to be killed, even a vampire.

471
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,032
I am not just "anyone" in
the lower class. I'm an aristocrat.

472
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,504
Love or feelings do
not exist in our world.

473
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:40,450
The only rule in our world is that the
weak become the victims of the strong.

474
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,684
Thus, the aristocrats
control the lowly humans.

475
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,745
A world where the weak
become the victims of the strong...

476
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,053
Your Ancient God
didn't teach such things.

477
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,552
The Ancient God?

478
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,077
D, would you like to take a shower?

479
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,187
D ...D!

480
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:22,756
D...

481
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,024
What's wrong?

482
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,456
I'm glad you are here.

483
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:28,056
I was worried that you
might have left again.

484
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,764
I'm sorry I said mean
things to you earlier.

485
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,869
I don't mind.
I've gotten used to it already.

486
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:37,063
I don't want you to
end up like my father.

487
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:41,408
Just because of he was a hunter,
he was forced to fight with vampires.

488
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,839
We've fought enough.

489
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,478
Let's go some place
else together to live.

490
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:48,544
I can't do that.

491
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,548
Why?!

492
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,621
You would be even
more unhappy, then you are now.

493
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,121
That's not true!

494
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:56,054
I ...I don't want you to die!

495
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,221
Stop it!

496
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,694
No! Let me stay
like this for a while.

497
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,892
It's all right.
Take my blood.

498
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,644
D.

499
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:52,882
Forgive me...

500
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,113
Why can't you be honest
with your feelings?

501
00:55:57,254 --> 00:56:00,417
Do you think every part of
yourself is cursed so badly?

502
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:05,861
You can't even grant a woman's wish.
Why can't you even be a dampiel?

503
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,721
Your father was...

504
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:08,797
Shut up!

505
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,158
Yeah, yeah...

506
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:16,235
Damn!

507
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:21,310
Well, at least I saved
this Incense of Time trap.

508
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,079
It was you?!

509
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,209
Wait a minute!

510
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,351
I can't wait.
I have to kill you.

511
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:11,552
You bastard!

512
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:31,345
I'm sorry, since you were kind
enough to let me go free last time.

513
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:37,012
Bastard!

514
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:39,785
Oh, you're really strong!
How is this?

515
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,674
Aristocrat,
eternal youth...

516
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,100
What kind of a man is he?

517
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,087
Now we are even.

518
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,356
D!

519
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,193
D! Are you still alive?!

520
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,160
D!

521
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:02,464
Brother, brother, wake up!
Open your eyes!

522
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:04,198
D!

523
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:10,111
Is he...dead?

524
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:54,180
You really are a stubborn girl.

525
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,650
Father, this is my last request.

526
00:59:57,895 --> 00:59:59,886
Please cancel the wedding tonight.

527
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,665
If you let that low
class girl into our family...

528
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,468
Ramica, the wedding tonight...

529
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,527
is only temporal
entertainment in my long life.

530
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,297
I know I will get
bored of her someday.

531
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,444
After that,
I will look for a new girl.

532
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:18,004
I'm doing this solely for pleasure.

533
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:21,478
Father, then I will kill her!

534
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,714
Otherwise,
the Lee family will collapse.

535
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:26,018
Ramica, listen to me!

536
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,848
The Lee family will not collapse
even if we invite a human girl...

537
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:35,021
because Ramica, your own
mother was the same as that girl.

538
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,292
She also came from
the lower class.

539
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:45,366
I have been living for
ten thousand years, in this world.

540
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,009
I don't think you
understand what that means.

541
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,746
Only boredom and
weariness surrounds me.

542
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,917
The best medicine for that is
to have some enjoyment...

543
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:58,282
with a lower class woman,
like your mother.

544
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:05,484
Poor humans live their small
lives while aristocrats like us...

545
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,893
rule their land.

546
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:10,794
When you consider that...

547
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,859
finding pleasure once every fifty to
a hundred years is not a big deal.

548
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:16,698
Father, take your false story back!

549
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,141
It's not a false story.

550
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,200
Your mother truly
belonged to lower class, but...

551
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:33,681
Ramica, your high pride
is purely aristocratic.

552
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,589
However, I don't want you
to disturb my wedding.

553
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,594
You should calm
yourself down for a while.

554
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,389
Count...

555
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:44,123
I ask you to do as you promised.

556
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:45,861
Promise?

557
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,903
Yes, to give me eternal youth
as a new member of the aristocracy.

558
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,104
You idiot! You did
so much blundering this time.

559
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,701
You should appreciate
that I've kept you alive.

560
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,437
Forget about eternal youth?!

561
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,706
Or wait for fifty years more.

562
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:05,715
Fifty years?!

563
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,293
Let's move.
He really gives me trouble.

564
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,797
What?

565
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,111
Oh, crap!
We have to hurry!

566
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:20,353
Hey, what's the matter?
Can't you move?

567
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:25,530
What's wrong D?
Wake up!

568
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,067
This isn't funny.
They found us.

569
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:32,870
Hey! What's wrong with you?
Move, move!

570
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,704
Hey D?
What happened to you?

571
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,869
Move! Move!

572
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:38,708
Please move!
Move...move!

573
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,382
Hey you! Move! Hey!
What are you doing?

574
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:54,253
Oh well, I guess we made it.

575
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,193
Sister.

576
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:40,740
Sister.

577
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:45,781
Sister!!

578
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,686
Ray, don't be rude.
Get out of our way.

579
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,817
This is the end of your life.

580
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:46,967
Wait for fifty years?
What do you think of our fifty years?!

581
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:50,968
I lost my left hand because of you,
and I had all my friends killed.

582
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,948
I don't care anymore!
I will make sure you die here too!

583
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:04,819
Did you actually think
that would work on me?

584
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:19,808
So long Ray.

585
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,907
What a fun day!

586
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:34,751
It is rare for me, in my life,
to have such a satisfying day.

587
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:53,904
We'd like to congratulate our Lord,
Count Magnus Lee, and his new wife.

588
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:56,404
I appreciate everybody's blessing.

589
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,580
You are the first woman
to give me such difficulty.

590
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:27,535
It's you?!

591
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:34,609
Vampires disappeared
for a long period of time.

592
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:38,082
Vampires are only
transient visitors in this world.

593
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,446
Transient visitors?

594
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,220
Vampires, and this castle, are
merely ghosts forgotten by time.

595
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,628
Go back to
the world where you belong!

596
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:49,998
That's very funny.

597
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,294
You are a dampiel, one who
was created out of our pleasure.

598
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,067
Do you think you can beat me?

599
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,801
I will have my fun
after taking care of you.

600
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,427
You look so miserable!

601
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:31,971
You are just a dampiel anyway.
I don't know why you hunt us...

602
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:34,977
but there is no way you could
win against a pure vampire.

603
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:39,709
Well then, let me kill you
in a different way from Ray.

604
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:49,356
I don't know how many
vampires you have killed ...

605
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,388
but what you are doing
is killing your own people.

606
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,257
Why don't you kill
yourself by that sword.

607
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:02,901
Who the hell are you?!

608
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,117
Sister!

609
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,153
Stop!!

610
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:55,754
Dan?

611
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,191
Sister! Sister!

612
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:07,532
Ra...Ramica, what are you doing?
Why don't you fight for me?!

613
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:12,766
Father, enough is enough!
The Lee family will be destroyed.

614
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:14,169
W...what?!

615
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:18,940
Since you wanted her and
forgot the pride of aristocracy.

616
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,443
R...ridiculous!

617
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:39,896
A...are you?!

618
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:42,764
M...maybe a prince...

619
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,405
...the son of our ancient god?!

620
01:10:54,984 --> 01:11:00,718
D ...ancient god...I will be destroyed
with my father in this castle.

621
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,922
I am not the Ancient God.

622
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,488
I am an aristocrat.

623
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,096
If our ancient god tells
us to be destroyed ...

624
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,926
we should follow your word.

625
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,869
I am just a dampiel, like you.

626
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,705
You have human blood inside you.

627
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:19,767
You can still live when you
take off the veil of an aristocrat.

628
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:22,907
No...I am a pure aristocrat.

629
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,604
I don't have any
low class blood inside me.

630
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:32,249
D!

631
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:33,747
Brother D!

632
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,081
I...I am pure aristocrat!

633
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,891
Brother, brother!

634
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:28,692
D!

635
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,561
Brother!

636
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:34,597
Brother!

637
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:35,501
D!

638
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:38,232
Brother!

639
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:39,104
D!!

640
01:14:41,377 --> 01:14:42,571
Brother!

641
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,270
D!!!
