Now, Bernie, seriously,

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,266
这就是约好见面的地方吗
this is where they asked us to meet?

21
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:03,404
没错 你想说什么
Yeah, what do you mean?

22
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,735
我想我看见她了
Oh, I think I see her.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,914
- 在哪儿 - 那一定是她
- Where? - Oh, that's gotta be her.

24
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,188
那我们接下来做什么呢
All right, so, what are we gonna do?

25
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,106
来这里喝杯奶昔吗 Bernie
Are we gonna grab a milkshake, Bernie?

26
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:13,132
就为这来的吗
Is that why we're here?

27
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:15,147
没错 我想是的
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess.

28
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,555
那你可要欠我一个大人情了
All right, you're gonna owe me big for this.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,359
那么...
So...

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,829
你觉得我该换件衬衣吗
You think I shoulda worn the other shirt?

31
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,017
你现在这样挺好
You look nice.

32
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,679
我不知道 Gus 也许...
I don't know, Gus, maybe she...

33
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,417
要是她不喜欢
what if she don't like

34
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,320
我的外表呢
the look of me or something?

35
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,593
Bernie 得了吧 你真的
Bernie, come on, are you sure...

36
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:52,571
这样想吗 那她呢
Are you serious? What about her?

37
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:54,609
你不也很想
Aren't you dying to see

38
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:55,914
见到她的样子吗
what she looks like?

39
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:56,928
她说不定特难看
She could be a dog.

40
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:58,224
不 她不是
No, she isn't a dog.

41
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,585
说不定呢
She could be.

42
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:00,188
我脑海里
I already know

43
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:01,306
已经知道她长什么样了
what she looks like in my head.

44
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,418
她不难看
she isn't a dog.

45
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
这么说...
So, uh...

46
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,914
你和她电话聊天
You've been talking to her

47
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,524
已经好几周了 对吗
for weeks on the phone, right?

48
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:09,416
- 是的 - 对吧
- Yeah. - Right?

49
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,512
没错
Yeah.

50
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:18,310
只和你聊天 她就喜欢上你了 Bernie
She likes you, from talkin' to you, Bernie.

51
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,381
我觉得你完全不用担心
And I don't think you gotta worry about

52
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,919
她会看不上你
her getting a good look at ya.

53
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,994
对你来说这根本不是问题
That ain't never been your problem.

54
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,071
我们走吧
Let's go.

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,223
快来
Come on.

56
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,250
真该换件衣服的
Shoulda worn the other shirt.

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,196
我的风险更大
I'm the one takin' the risk.

58
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:48,514
和我约会的女孩
Doublin' with some girl

59
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:49,680
我连话都没说过
I never even spoke to,

60
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:50,974
更别说见面了
let alone seen.

61
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,233
不知为何这个叫Miriam的女孩
I don't know why this Miriam girl

62
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:54,008
非得要求今晚来个四人约会
says it's gotta be a double date anyway.

63
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,860
也许她对我的态度还不是很确定
Maybe she's not sure about me yet.

64
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,096
怎么可能有姑娘
How can anybody

65
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,678
对你不确定呢 Bernie

嘿 可别把这件事
Yeah, hey, don't tell the other guys

68
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:04,660
告诉队里的人
down at the station about this.

69
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:07,021
你又不是以前没约会过
It's not like you've never been on a date before.

70
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,347

86
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:30,145

89
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:51,122
Bernie Miriam从没坐过船

Has she never?

92

我说过 我不明白
I told her I don't know how

93
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,515
她怎么要和一名海岸警卫队员约会

94
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:58,853
我不怕水 我就住在海角那里
I'm not scared, I live on the Cape.

95
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,814
别担心 Miriam
Don't worry, Miriam, you know,

96
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,744

只是在夜里才会害怕
It scares me at night, that's all, you know.

99
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:10,509
因为看不见水下有什么
You can't see what's underneath.

100
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,134
只是更多的水而已
Just more water.

00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,806
如果Bernie陪我 我就去
If Bernie's with me, I'll do it.

143
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:08,197
渔船吗
Oh, a fishing boat?

144
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,861
除了要我们帮忙靠船 那些渔民
Those fishermen don't want us around,

145
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,384
都不愿让我们靠近渔船
unless we're pulling them in.

146
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:14,954
他们认为那片水域只属于他们
They think they own the God damned water.

147
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:16,705
他们可不怎么友好
They're not very nice.

148
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,466
拜托 别犯傻了 Miriam
Come on, don't be such a fathead, Miriam.

149
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:20,248
没错
Yeah.

150
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:21,925
我们一起坐船出去
Let's go out on the dory,

151
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:23,541
有什么好怕的
what's there to be afraid of?

152
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,261
谁知道水下有什么 是吗
What's underneath, right?

153
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,996
Stello先生 你好吗
Hey, Mr. Stello, how's it goin'?

154
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,363
- 你好 Bernie - Ryder先生
- Hey, Bernie. - Mr. Ryder.

155
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:48,568
你看见那位...
Hey, so you see that...

156
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,408
坐在那儿的姑娘了吗

157
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,611
穿着大衣
The one with the coat

158
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:53,806
看起来像只熊的那位吗 Bernie
looks like a bear, Bernie?

159
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,463
- 没错 - 她很显眼
- Yeah. - Can't miss her.

160
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,979
我也这么说
I said the same thing myself,

161
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,330
真好笑 你竟然和我说的一样
funny you should say that, yeah.

162
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:01,211
看上去就像斯摩基 对吧 斯摩基熊
Looks like Smokey, right? Smokey the Bear?

163
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,900
我不知道什么是斯摩基熊 Bernie
I don't know no Smokey, Bernie.

164
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,799
它... 是个卡通人物
It's... it's just a cartoon.

165
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,776
对了 Stello先生
Anyway, Mr. Stello,

166
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:07,639
她... 她觉得
she... she thinks

167
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,002
自己害怕搭船出海
she's scared of going out on a boat.

168
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:10,204
我觉得
And I don't think

169
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,600
我们不该划平底船出去
we should row out on a dory,

170
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,251
我不愿让她
I don't want to

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,822
吐在那件漂亮的大衣上
get her sick on that nice big coat.

172
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,869
所以能否...
So I was wondering if...

173
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,110
所以 你想带她
So, you wanna take her

174
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,694
坐着Anna G号在港口转转 是吗
on the Anna G around the harbor?

175
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,705
没错
Yeah.

176
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,725
有心出海
Can't row out on that dory,

177
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:23,291
却不敢划小船 对吗 Bernie
even if you wanted, right, Bernie?

178
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,510
Carl 别说了
Carl, stop.

179
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,265
一周年就要到了
Year anniversary's coming,

180
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:28,166
我姐姐现在还住在我家
My sister's now livin' in my house.

181
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,412
你对此作何感想 Bernie
How's it going with you, Bernie?

182
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,384
够了 Carl 他当时尽力了
That's enough, Carl, he did all he could.

183
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,916
我很抱歉 Nickerson先生
I am sorry, Mr. Nickerson.

184
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:40,854
我无意惹你伤心
I didn't mean to upset you,

185
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,504
只想找Stello先生
just wanted to ask Mr. Stello about

186
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,362
借一条船

187
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,010

没事的
It's okay.

193
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,710
1952年 2月 17日

194
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,944
# 庄园漆黑一片 #
Now the hacienda's dark.

195
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,489
# 小镇陷入沉睡 #

196

# 离别时刻已到 #

# 潸然泪下 #

# 愿主与你同在 我的至爱 #

# 拂晓即将来临 #

# 迎来灰暗明天 #

他们就不适应... 这个
they're just not cut out for... for this.

有时一去就再也回不来了
Sometimes you go out and you don't come back.

253
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,344

284
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,841
如果颠簸得再厉害些 可能会再次裂开
Takes a bad jolt, she could fracture again.

285
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,861
船长 我不用到甲板上去
I don't have to go on deck, Cap

286
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,310
这里都能听到它的声音
I can hear it from right down here.

287
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,552
那条焊缝真的在响
The weld is really hummin'.

288
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,794
它在响 先生 焊缝... 在响
it's hummin', Sir, the weld is... hummin'.

289
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,216
我请求把船速降到三节
I'd like to take it down to three knots please.

290
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,349
如果不减速
If we don't slow down

291
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,382
船长 我们也许...
Captain, we might not have a...

292
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:26,951
撑不住的
position to hold.

293
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:31,888
没问题 船长
No problem, Cap'n.

294
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,248
保持在七节 谢谢 长官
Holdin' at seven knots, thank you, Sir.

295
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:47,521
- 老爹 - 说吧
- Hey, Pop? - I hear it.

296
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,998
你去甲板上看看
Ya wanna go up on deck have a look at

297
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:52,880
那条焊缝的止裂铆 好吗
those crack arrestors holdin' that weld together?

298
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,943
最好戴顶帽子去 老爹
You might as well go get a hat, Papo.

299
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:57,669
他说什么
What did he say?

300
00:15:58,337 --> 00:15:59,637
他说去的时候
He says he'd like you to consider

301
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,340
记得戴顶帽子
taking a hat with ya as well.

302
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:17,215
睡会觉吧
Get some sleep.

303
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,869
# 大家都叫你坐下 #
For the people all said sit down

304
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
# 坐下吧 你让船晃个不停 #
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

305
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,799
喂 老爹
Hey, Pops!

306
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,637
你了解这种天气吗
What do you know about this weather,

307
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,225
我和小Eldon在这里都被折腾死了
it's killin' me and young Eldon here?

308
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:27,778
小家伙 你确定是因为天气吗
Tiny, ya sure it's the weather?

309
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:29,457
也许是被你的歌声搞的
Maybe it's your singin'.

310
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
# 大家都叫你坐下 #
For the people all said sit down

311
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,500
# 坐下吧 你让船晃个不停 #
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

312
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,356
一起唱吧
Come on.

313
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,477
# 人们都叫你坐下 #
The people all said sit down

314
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,160
# 坐下吧 你让船晃个不停 #
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat

315
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,942
闭嘴 闭嘴 闭嘴
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

316
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,246
情况越来越糟了
It's gonna get worse.

317
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,074
Sybert
Sybert!

318
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,543
我没法上甲板去
I didn't make it topside!

319
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,840
这样的海里那条焊缝撑不住的
That weld can't hold in these seas!

320
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,567
必须要减速
Ya gotta slow her down.

321
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:13,934
我再给船长打电话
I'm callin' the Captain back.

322
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:48,879
进水了
It's comin' in!

323
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,106
- 你没事吧 老爹 - 没事
- You okay, Pops? - Yeah.

324
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,235
到上面去
Go up!

325
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,324
轮机舱内船体出现了一条裂缝
We've got a hull fracture in the engine room!

326
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:16,699
所有人 拿上床垫 毯子
All hands! Muster mattresses, blankets,

327
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:18,942
拿上一切可以拿的
whatever you can get your hands on.

328
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,993
Tchuda
Tchuda.

329
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:31,965
怎么了
Yeah, boy?

330
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,473
指挥舱没人回话
I can't get anyone on the bridge.

331
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:35,956
我要你上去告诉船长
I need you to go up and tell the Captain

332
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,927
我们的船体有道十八英尺的裂缝
we got an eighteen foot fracture in our hull.

333
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:39,754
告诉他这些水泵现在还能撑一下
Tell him these pumps are holdin' for now, but

334
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,133
但如果不及时靠岸 船就要沉了
we don't put her to port, we're gonna wreck.

335
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:42,926
船长听不懂我的话的 傻子
The Cap'n don't understand me, Balou.

336
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,762
我知道他听不懂你的话
I know he can't understand you,

337
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,645
反正谁的话他都不听
he don't listen to anyone anyway.

338
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,520
天哪 我的上帝
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

339
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,496
- 外面冷吗 - 没错
- Cold out there? - Yeah.

340
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,757
你还在修那个东西吗
Ya still tryin' to fix that darn thing?

341
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:25,506
是啊
Yeah.

342
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,060
行了 Fitzy 没用的
Ah, c'mon, Fitzy, it's useless.

343
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:29,379
让能修的来修吧
Let the guy who fixes it to come fix it.

344
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,426
他要在就不用我上了
I would if he would show up.

345
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,363
无线电在说什么 有条船断了吗
What's this on the radio, a ship breakin' up?

346
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,223
是Fort Mercer号
That's the Fort Mercer.

347
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:37,067
Fort Mercer号
Fort... Fort Mercer?

348
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,426
是艘大船 T2型油轮
She's a big lady, she's a T2 tanker.

349
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,277
几小时前就开始发来无线电
Started radioin' a couple of hours ago,

350
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,395
显然船体出现了大裂缝
apparently she's got a big crack in her hull,

351
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,848
油喷得到处都是
it's spillin' oil all over the place.

352
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,574
位置约在南塔基特以东二十英里
She's about 20 miles east, off of Nantucket.

353
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:49,872
好像波士顿和南塔基特
It sounds like Boston and

354
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,992
已派出所有的船去营救了
Nantucket are sendin' out their entire fleet.

355
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,395
下面也许就该我们了
We could be next.

356
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,942
他们说暴风的风速
They're saying gale force winds

357
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,765
有每小时五十至六十英里
50 to 60 miles per hour.

358
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,678
是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,518
浪高五十英尺 完毕
...waves at 50 feet. Over.

360
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:02,848
真是悲惨啊
It's gonna be a mess.

361
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:13,278
Bernie Bernie Miriam给你来过电话

Webber 带上一名队员
Webber, take yourself a crew,

367
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,035
去帮那些渔民
go out there help them fishermen

368
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,410
把码头上的渔船停好

369
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:34,356
好的 长官

Permission, permission... for a girl?

373

Cluff先生 修好了
Mr. Cluff, it's working.

374
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,009
- 是的 长官 - 现在不谈这个 Webber

现在没空 Webber
Not now, Webber.

378
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:57,494
现在好了
We're back up.

379
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,422
这一堆船是去营救Mercer号的 对吗
Cluster here is the Mercer Rescue, right?

380
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,259
而这个点 离这里两英里...
This here other pip, two miles from here...

381
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,920
这肯定还是幻象回波
We must still be gettin' phantom echoes.
幻象波是上次同步扫描发射未衰减完全(或遗留到这次同步扫描后)的回波

382
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:05,942
这肯定还是幻象回波
We must still be gettin' phantom echoes.

383
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:06,687
这怎么判断
How we suppose to

384
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:08,127
到底是在哪个位置
tell where anything is out there?

385
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,548
那个技师什么时候能来
When's that technician comin',

386
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,690
Fitzpatrick 该死的Bangs队长又在哪儿

388
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:17,642
Bangs队长在食堂 长官
Chief Bangs is in the mess hall, Sir.

389
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,909
就因为我不是本地人
You makin' fun of my accent 'cause

390
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:23,987
你就取笑我的口音是吗
I'm not from around here?

391
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,259
不敢 Cluff先生
No, Mr. Cluff.

392
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,680
Webber 为什么还站在这儿
Why are you still standin' here, Webber?

393
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:31,188
长官...

00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:34,583
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

397
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,639
长官 你要我和Webber
Ya want me to go with Webber, Sir,

398
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,764
一起去绑渔船吗
to secure fishing boats?

399
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,612
没听明白吗 Livesey
You didn't hear me, Livesey,

400
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:44,616
对... 你和Webber一起去

够了吧 你们有什么想法

403
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,913
船进了水
We're takin' on water inside,

404
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,088
我们得去坐救生船
we gotta launch some lifeboats.

405
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:19,747
你真是个混蛋 Brown
Why you gotta be such a jackass, Brown.

406
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:20,709
我们至少得为
The least we can do

407
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,994
船长 Collagen大副还有其他人
pray for the Captain, Chief Collagen,

408
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,038
祈祷一下 他们都是好人啊
the rest of them men, all good men.

409
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:27,309
我们不是好人吗 Quirey
Hey, ain't we good men, Quirey?

410
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:29,220
别误会 祈祷是没错
Don't get me wrong, prayin's great,

411
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:30,749
但没什么用
but it ain't everything.

412
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:33,624
现在我们需要的是采取行动
We need to actually do something.

413
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,036
Sybert
Sybert

414
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:44,436
借一步说话
A word.

415
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,247
那个鲁莽的Brown
That hothead Brown,

416
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:48,343
他要去放救生船
he wants to launch the lifeboats.

417
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:49,037
救生船
The lifeboats?

418
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:50,833
而Quirey主张什么也别做
Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.

419
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:51,553
他们
And between them,

420
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,749
让大伙的情绪都不太稳定
the two of them are getting the men worked up.

421
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,000
现在
Now,

422
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,796
我想你是最了解这艘船的人
I figure that you know the boat better than anybody,

423
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:05,127
你对它最有权威性了 所以...
you're practically married to it, so...

424
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,034
我想他们会听你的
I think they'll listen to ya.

425
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,561
听我的
Listen to me?

426
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:10,897
老爹 这些人都不喜欢我
Pop, those men don't like me.

427
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,944
除了你和Tchuda 这船上没人喜欢我
Nobody on the ship likes me, but you and Tchuda.

428
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:15,308
他们也许是不喜欢你
They might not like ya

429
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,139
但他们会明白这事要听你的
but they'll know to listen to ya.

430
00:24:43,571 --> 00:24:46,406
我们不知道船长是否发出了求救信号
We don't know if the Captain got off an SOS.

431
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:49,110
报务室没了 我们没法求救
The radio room's gone, we can't call nobody.

432
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,730
现在只有... Garcia在这里
Now it's just... just Garcia over here with a

433
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,943
用短波找信号
little shortwave trying to pick up chatter.

434
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:53,847
就眼下的状况
I mean, as far as we know,

435
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,813
没人知道我们在这里
nobody even knows we're out here.

436
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:58,915
我觉得趁现在还能走
Now, I'm sayin' we launch some lifeboats now

437
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:00,440
放下救生船离开这艘船
and get off this ship while you can.

438
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:00,980
在这样的风暴里
How you gonna get 'em

439
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:02,618
怎么放救生船呢
down in the water in this storm?

440
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:05,069
行不通 这些船太小了
It can't be done, those boats are too small,

441
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:06,570
这等于自杀 Brown
it's suicide, Brown.

442
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:08,153
这也不能 那也不能
You can't do this, you can' do that,

443
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,246
你要我们怎么办 Quirey
whaddya want us to do, Quirey?

444
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,782
坐以待毙吗
just sit up here, do nothing?

445
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:13,070
够了 没有领导 没有指令
That's it, no officers, no orders,

446
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,175
只能自寻生路
every man for himself.

447
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,008
不能这样 Brown
That ain't the way, Brown.

448
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:18,688
这样对谁都没好处
That never did nothin' for nobody.

449
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,113
船是断在八号与九号
Now, the ship's split,

450
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:23,260
压载舱之间的隔离壁处
at the bulkheads separating tanks eight and nine,

451
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:24,991
Sybert先生说其他压载舱
Now, Mr. Sybert says the other tanks

452
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,686
没有破裂 所以...
aren't fractured, so...

453
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:29,064
舱里的空气应该可以让我们继续浮着
the air in the ballast tanks should keep us afloat.

454
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,993
但是Sybert先生也说了...
But, Mr. Sybert also says...

455
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:33,964
Sybert先生这样说 那样说
Mr. Sybert says this, Mr. Sybert says that,

456
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:35,506
他是个成年人了 让他自己说
he's a big boy, let him say it himself

457
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:36,485
他不就在这儿吗
he's right here.

458
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,000
说啊
G'ahead.

459
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,179
船会沉的
We're sinkin'.

460
00:25:50,504 --> 00:25:52,222
但是汽笛还能用
Yeah, but the whistle works.

461
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:55,128
所以应该让它一直响着
So, we should keep blowin' that,

462
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,925
也许会有人听见
maybe somebody'll hear it.

463
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:01,461
我也说不清 但船的确是在下沉
I don't know, but we're definitely sinking.

464
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:03,142
轮机舱的裂缝
The crack in the engine room is takin'

465
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,493
导致大量进水
on too much water,

466
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,357
抽水泵来不及排水
the pumps can't keep up.

467
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:11,402
如果水位到了引擎进风口
If the water reaches the air intake in the engine,

468
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:13,278
我们就会失去全部电力
we're gonna lose all the power.

469
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:14,855
没了电力 抽水泵就转不了
If we lose all the power, we lose the pumps,

470
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:16,865
抽水泵转不了...
and if we lose the pumps...

471
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,447
船就会很快下沉
she's gonna drop pretty quick.

472
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:22,140
那我们还能坚持多久
How long have we got before that happens?

473
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,538
也许四到五个小时吧
Four, maybe five hours.

474
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,365
我们得尽量多争取些时间
Well, we need to buy ourselves some time.

475
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,867
让别人可以找到我们
So somebody can find us.

476
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,625
那也得有人看得到啊
If anybody's even lookin'.

477
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,721
即便他们知道我们在这里
Even if they do know we're here

478
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:38,764
这翻江倒海的天气
the sea is big enough.

479
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:41,117
船都被劈成两半了
I mean it'd rip this thing in half.

480
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,936
我们怎么出得去
How the hell we gonna get out?

481
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:45,589
所以我说要放救生船
That's why I'm sayin' we gotta launch some lifeboats.

482
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:46,894
别再指望好运了
Our luck's runnin' out.

483
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,136
我不相信运气 Brown
I don't believe in luck, Brown.

484
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:51,709
在这样的海里放救生船
Put those lifeboats in those seas,

485
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:53,031
撑不过十二秒
they won't last 12 seconds.

486
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:55,924
你和Quirey就是想坐以待毙
You and Quirey both you just wanna sit around and do nothin'.

487
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,692
你有什么好办法吗 Sybert
You got a better idea, Sybert,

488
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,310
还是干脆躲到下面去算了
or you just go back hide down below?

489
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:09,681
我们得让船搁浅
We'll run her aground.

490
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,317
什么
Do what?

491
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,720
让它搁浅吗 Sybert
We're gonna run her aground, Sybert?

492
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:15,255
就算这半条船还能动
Even if you could with half a ship

493
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,180
你这是什么目的
why would you?

494
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:19,092
它会四分五裂 让我们全掉进海里
Just break apart, dump us all out in the sea.

495
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:20,492
这是唯一的办法了
It's our only choice,

496
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:21,649
找一处软浅滩
we're gonna find a soft shoal

497
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:22,766
在那里搁浅
and we'll lay 'er up,

498
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,450
进水会被减缓
slow the water that's comin' in,

499
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:26,465
停在那里 再拉响汽笛
stay in the same spot, we'll blow the whistle,

500
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:27,863
让找我们的人
we'll give whoever's comin' to look

501
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:29,070
有机会发现我们
for us a chance to find us.

502
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:31,835
没有了液压系统 怎么驾船
We're gonna steer a ship without hydraulics?

503
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:34,718
这就是你的计划 怎么行得通呢
That's your plan? How's that gonna work?

504
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,603
做一个手动舵柄
I'll build a manual tiller.

505
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:38,647
Sybert 为什么我们要听你的
Hey, Sybert, why should we even listen to you?

506
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:40,449
你只关心这条船
The only thing you ever cared about was this ship,

507
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:41,323
要我说...
Man, I'll tell you what...

508
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:43,475
你们俩去海底成双成对吧
You two make a cute couple at the bottom from the ocean.

509
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,718
而我 要上救生船
Me? I'm gonna get onto a lifeboat.

510
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:47,249
听着
Look.

511
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:52,695
我们在舵扇里插入一根钢梁
We'll insert a steel beam into the steering quadrant.

512
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:56,968
另一端挂上滑轮组用来操纵...
We'll put pulleys on the end of it for leverage...

513
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,460
这样就能手动开船了
and then we'll move 'er manually.

514
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,421
对不起 打断下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

515
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:11,140
无线电好像可以用了
I think I got the radio working.

516
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,124
方位八十三度
Bearing 83 degrees true,

517
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,459
距Pollack Rip灯塔二十七英里
27 miles from Pollack Rip Light,

518
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,541
南塔基特以东约二十英里
about 20 miles east of Nantucket.

519
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:23,024
南塔基特以东 不是我们Pendleton号啊
East of Nantucket? That ain't the Pendleton.

520
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:23,502
Fort Mercer号紧急...
Fort Mercer's emergency...

521
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,546
Fort Mercer号 另一艘T2油轮
Fort Mercer, that's another T2.

522
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:29,575
除了我们还有一艘油轮断成两半啊
Another tanker split in two besides us.

523
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,320
如果全都去救他们了 谁来...
But if everyone's gonna help them, who's gonna...

524
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,593
谁来救我们啊
who's gonna come for us?

525
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:41,078
你感觉如何 没事吧
How you feelin'? You all right?

526
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:45,179
- 你... 请示过Cluff了吗 - 还没
- Did you... did you ask Cluff yet? - No.

527
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:46,352
为什么不请示呢
Why didn't you ask him?

528
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:47,348
- Webber - 你怎么回事
- Hey, Webber! - What's wrong with you?

529
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,059
- 我还以为... - Webber
- I think I got one more... - Webber!

530
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,734
- 什么事 - 你问了Cluff没有
- What? - You asked him yet, you ask Cluff?

531
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:55,887
我告诉过你 别说出去
I told you not to tell nobody.

532
00:28:55,912 --> 00:28:57,527
抱歉 我今天不太舒服
I'm sorry, I'm not havin' a very good day.

533
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:58,994
我知道你身体不好...
I know you're not feelin' well...

534
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:01,164
Webber 结婚无需批准
You know, Webber, you don't need permission to get married.

535
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:04,867
- 要的 队长 - 除非你还未到年龄
- No, actually, you do Chief. - Unless you're underage.

536
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,937
谢谢 队长 我只是服从规定而已
Thanks, Chief, just followin' regulations.

537
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:09,660
我们去换制服吧
Let's go get suited up.

538
00:29:09,685 --> 00:29:11,693
那个不是规定 Webber
It's not regulation, Webber,

539
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:14,414
只是个形式罢了 礼节性的
it's just a formality, like a courtesy.

540
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:18,025
还有 我听说是她向你求婚 真的吗
And hey! Did I hear right, that she asked you?

541
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,218
服从命令 Webber
Followin' orders, right, Webber?

542
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,916
对 是她求婚的 队长
Yeah, she asked me, Chief.

543
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:27,705
Webber 是你有种呢
Are you sure you're got your pants on, Webber,

544
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,852
还是她有种
or is she wearin' 'em?

545
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,424
听上去就像这姑娘割了你的...
Sounds like this girl cut off your pe...

546
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,677
怎么 Webber 怎么了
What, Webber? What? Huh?

547
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:37,744
你不是要去绑船吗
Don't ya got boats t'tie up?

548
00:29:38,865 --> 00:29:41,189
她... 她是我的未婚妻 长官
She's... she's my fiancée, Sir.

549
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:44,150
而且主动...
Who asked you...

550
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:46,853
向你求婚
to be married.

551
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:50,283
Richie 我们走吧
Come on, Richie, let's go.

552
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:53,894
请稍等 好的
One moment. Uh-huh, sure.

553
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,189
抱歉 先生 请大点声
I'm sorry, Sir, please speak up.

554
00:29:56,214 --> 00:29:59,042
线路不稳定 女士 我再重接一下
This line is bad, Ma'am, I'll try and re-connect.

555
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,833
请谅解 先生 线路断了
Please, sir, the lines are down.

556
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:03,461
Bernie 你好吗 工作怎么样
Bernie? How are ya? How's work?

557
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:06,533
老样子 你好吗
It's been one of those days, ya know, but how are you?

558
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,744
- 你是雷达技师吗 - 不是
- Hey, you're not the radar technician, are ya? - Ah, no.

559
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:12,414
上面命令我待在这里直到风暴过去
I was ordered to hole up here until the storm passes,

560
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,787
然后搭船回到我的灯塔船
Catch a ride back on my lightship.

561
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:17,557
你可以在食堂等着
You can go wait in the mess hall if you want to.

562
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,705
现在不太方便
Now is not a good time, ya know.

563
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,369
我得准备去码头
I gotta get ready and go down to the pier,

564
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:23,801
固定船只 所以...
tie up some boats. So...

565
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,095
真希望你在我身边
I wish you were here with me.

566
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,714
我听说有一艘船
I'm hearin' all sorts of things

567
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,859
在海上断裂了 我...
about a ship breakin'up and I... oh.

568
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:30,627
怎么了 你没事吧
What, are you okay?

569
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:33,627
没事 我们的灯灭了
Yeah, we just lost our lights.

570
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:36,205
那你得去找回来
You better go find 'em, then.

571
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:39,439
南塔基特已派出那艘三十六英尺的船去救援Mercer号
Nantucket's dispatch their 36-footer to the Mercer.

572
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:41,298
- 我们也收到了相同的命令 - 你请示Cluff了吗
- We got orders to do the same. - You ask Cluff yet?

573
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:42,123
那是他在说话 对吧
That's him, right?

574
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:44,596
还没有 宝贝
No, not yet, Sweet.

575
00:30:45,063 --> 00:30:47,995
- 回头再解释 我得走了 - 好的
- I'll explain later. I just... I gotta go. - Okay.

576
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,291
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you, too.

577
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,861
再见
Yeah, bye.

578
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,493
神奇的是 她根本不知道我是谁
The best part, she had no idea who I was.

579
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:00,853
Bangs
Bangs,

580
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,962
你带上队员
pick yourself a crew,

581
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,419
驾驶36-500号离开老港
take the 36-500 outta Old Harbor,

582
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:06,717
前往南塔基特以东二十英里处的
proceed to the Fort Mercer

583
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:09,236
Fort Mercer号 听见了吗
20 miles east of here off Nantucket, ya hear?

584
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,154
我觉得这种天气下
Well, I don't believe

585
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:13,161
我们过不了那片沙洲 Cluff先生
we'd get over the bar in this weather, Mr. Cluff.

586
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,408
最好换成Stage港的36-383号
We're better off takin' the 36-383 outta Stage Harbor.

587
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:18,955
那会花更多的时间 对吗
Well, it would take longer, right?

588
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,705
不会太多
Not much.

589
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:24,960
你怎么看 Webber
What do you think, Webber?

590
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:26,029
你也是水手长
You're a boatswain, too,

591
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,449
知道外面什么情况
you know what it's like out there.

592
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:29,391
Cluff先生 这种天气下谁也过不了沙洲
Yeah, look, no one's gettin' over the bar

593
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,152
没人做得到
in this weather, Mr. Cluff, nobody,

594
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:32,610
这无异于自杀
it's a suicide mission.

595
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:35,666
我们应该开Stage港的36-383号
We should take the 36-383 outta Stage Harbor.

596
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:37,258
虽然会多花点时间
It would take longer, sure,

597
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:39,041
但至少能出海
but at least we'll be able to get out.

598
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,474
祝你成功 队长
Godspeed, Chief.

599
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,959
Webber 你带Gouthro和Livesey去渔船码头
Webber, take Gouthro and Livesey down the fishing pier.

600
00:31:52,984 --> 00:31:54,677
遵命 长官
Yes, Sir.

601
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:11,687
别传染给我 Gus 你就不该出来
Don't get me sick, Gus, you shouldn't even be out here.

602
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,918
你干吗老指责我们 Richie
Why you always raggin' on us, Richie?

603
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:16,236
别因为你没被Bangs挑上就拿我们撒气
Don't take it out on us 'cause you you couldn't go out with Bangs.

604
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,261
至少他可以出海
At least he'll get out.

605
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,552
去你的 过去都一年了
Screw you, it was a year ago.

606
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,487
去你的
Screw you.

607
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:22,284
那种天气谁也越不过沙洲
No one coulda got over the bar that day.

608
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,577
Bangs可以的
Bangs coulda.

609
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:24,531
真的过不了 Richie
No, really, Richie,

610
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:27,251
今天他也不想去越过沙洲
he's not tryin' to get across the bar today.

611
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:30,096
他也要开36-383号走海湾边的
No, he said he did 36-383 right out from the nice,

612
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,204
安全路线
protected bayside.

613
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:37,692
Bernie
Well, Bernie,

614
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,103
Richie还是Bangs还是Nickerson
it doesn't matter what Richie here thinks,

615
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:44,233
或任何人怎么想并不重要
or Bangs or Nickerson or nobody.

616
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:48,072
没人可以救出Landry号上的人
Nobody coulda got out to save the men on the Landry.

617
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:53,446
有时就会劫数难逃 Bernie
Sometimes, ya know, sometimes men die, Bernie.

618
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,914
好了 开始吧
All right, here we go.

619
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,719
抓紧 小心 伙计们
All right, hang on. Easy, now. Easy, fellas.

620
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:37,681
- 我能行的 - 好 向上抬

621
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:44,570

One two, all together now.

622
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:47,688
三

623
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:53,995
- 绑住 小伙子们 - 明白
- Tie it down, boys. - I got it.

624
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,752
好了 现在我们有舵柄了
All right, now we got a tiller

625
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:57,375
可以把船开到沙洲去了
we're gonna drive her up on a shoal.

626
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,078
Brown和一些人
Uh-uh, Brown and them others

627
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:00,987
准备放救生船了
they're gettin' ready to launch those lifeboats.

628
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:04,563
- 他们认为这是唯一的生路 - 哦 老爹
- They think it's their best hope. - Oh, Pop.

629
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:07,711
我们需要全部人手
We need every guy we got.

630
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:10,742
他们要上救生船了
Well, they're gonna take the lifeboats.

631
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:45,314
- 你干什么 Sybert - 放开他
- What are you trying to do, Sybert? - Get off him.

632
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:49,200
你想要害死我们吗 害死我们吗
You come up here tryin' to kill us? You tryin' to kill us?

633
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,474
放开他
Back off him.

634
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,913
起来
Get up!

635
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:53,399
你疯了
You're out of your mind!

636
00:35:53,424 --> 00:35:55,204
Brown 他救了你 懂吗
Brown, he just saved your life! Okay?

637
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:59,502
救生船成碎片了 毁了 你省省吧
The boat's in pieces, it's gone! Enough!

638
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:05,926
这种海浪这样的小船根本撑不住
That boat is too small for these seas.

639
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:09,970
而这艘船天黑前就会沉没
And this ship will be sunk by nightfall.

640
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,250
现在要想活命
Now, every fella here wants to live,

641
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,556
唯一的方法
the only way that happens...

642
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:16,650
就是让船搁浅
is if we run her aground.

643
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:22,416
安排人瞭望 寻找一处沙洲
We gotta set up a watch and look out for a shoal.

644
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,261
我需要四个人操纵
I need four men working the pulleys

645
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,495
舵柄上的滑轮组
on the emergency tiller.

646
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,457
四个人去操纵船尾舵的抽水机
I need four men manning the pumps, aft of steering.

647
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:31,205
其他人负责从上到下接力传话
And the rest of you run a bucket line topside down below...

648
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:33,853
与轮机舱保持沟通
...communicate with the engine room!

649
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,224
还要一个人 负责鸣笛
And somebody... keep blowin' that whistle.

650
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:44,423
你们都听到了吗 动起来吧 快点
You heard him, boys, now move it, c'mon.

651
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:51,431
看起来你现在是老大了 Sybert
It sounds like you're the man now, Sybert.

652
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:56,103
但愿你不会害死我们
I hope you didn't just kill us all.

653
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:17,149
四十五分钟之前 我在家里
I saw a ship drifting, heard it whistle.

654
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:20,208
看到有艘船在海上飘着 还听到了鸣笛声 Bernie
A distress signal. 45 minutes ago, Bernie,

655
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:22,172
是呼救信号
from my house.

656
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,505
风向朝南
With the wind blowing south,

657
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,962
再加上海流作用
and those currents, I, uh...

658
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,506
我猜它现在应该
I guess that'd put her close to here

659
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:31,984
更靠近这里 要过沙洲了
about now comin' up over the bar.

660
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:34,086
这不可能是Mercer号 Bernie
It can't be part of the Mercer, Bernie.

661
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:36,251
它在南塔基特 距这里东南方四十英里
She's off Nantucket 40 miles southeast of here,

662
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:38,069
应该是往西北方向漂移的 对吗
means she woulda drifted Northwest then, right?

663
00:37:38,094 --> 00:37:40,047
我听得清清楚楚
I know what I heard.

664
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:43,649
看得清清楚楚
Know what I saw.

665
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,486
那好吧
Well, okay then...

666
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:50,939
那我们回哨站去
How 'bout we go back to the Station

667
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,672
看看到底什么情况
see if we can get to the bottom of it?

668
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:56,562
刚刚和波士顿通了电话
Just got off the phone with Boston.

669
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:58,106
他们的一架飞机绕道离开Merce号时
They diverted a plane from the Mercer,

670
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,326
看到了Pendleton号的船尾
and it sighted the stern of the tanker Pendleton

671
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:02,357
就在这里以东五英里处
5 miles east of here.

672
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:06,740
上帝啊 一天之内两艘油轮断裂
My God, two tankers broken in half in one day

673
00:38:06,765 --> 00:38:08,511
该创纪录了吧
that's gotta be some kind of record.

674
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,838
波士顿和南塔基特
Boston and Nantucket have

675
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,974
都派遣了所有船只前往Mercer号
dispatched all their boats to the Mercer.

676
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,513
这种天气他们到不了这里
They can't make it here in this weather.

677
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,665
Webber 你带上一队人
Webber, pick yourself a crew

678
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,432
开那艘36-500号越过沙洲
take that 36-500 out and you go over the bar,

679
00:38:44,461 --> 00:38:47,565
找到Pendleton号的船尾 明白了吗
and you find the stern of the Pendleton, ya hear?

680
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:52,796
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

681
00:39:03,654 --> 00:39:07,130
你们要喝点咖啡暖和一下吗
You fellas wanna get warmed up, get some coffee?

682
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,996
- Bernie - 什么事
- Bernie. - Yeah?

683
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,395
怎么了
What?

684
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:16,688
Carl想说的是...
What Carl's tryin' to say...

685
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:20,212
- 别因为Landry号的事去干 - 肯定就是
- This isn't about the Landry. - Sure it is.

686
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,915
Richie
Richie.

687
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,106
那晚死了八个人
Eight men died that night.

688
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:26,525
而你 Gus还有Masachi连海都出不去
You and Gus and Masachi couldn't even get out.

689
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:29,923
你凭什么觉得现在就能做到呢
What makes you think you can do it now?

690
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:35,631
- 你清楚这时候沙洲是什么样的 对吧 Bernie - 清楚
- You know the bar on this kinda day, right, Bernie? - Yeah.

691
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:36,948
里面那家伙根本不懂
That man in there don't know what he's doin'

692
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,561
他是在让你去送死
he's sendin' you out to die.

693
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:42,065
这种天气 你不可能越过查塔姆沙洲
You can't make it over Chatham bar on a day like this.

694
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:46,292
那半艘船也坚持不了多久
Can't stay afloat for long on half a ship neither.

695
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:52,026
你也知道 Stello先生 在海岸警卫队
Ya know, Mr. Stello, in the Coast Guard

696
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,889
他们只说要你出去...
they say ya gotta go out...

697
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:56,300
但没说你非得回来
But they don't say you gotta come back in.

698
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,354
这是规定
That's regulations, ya know.

699
00:39:58,383 --> 00:40:01,472
Bernie 但愿你没开出太远就迷航了
Bernie, better you get lost before you get too far out there.

700
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,667
别担心 Ryder先生
Don't worry about me, Mr. Ryder,

701
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,007
不会迷航的 那片海域我很熟悉
I can't get lost out there, I know those waters pretty good.

702
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:07,839
怎么会迷航呢
How can I get lost?

703
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:08,734
不 不 Bernie
No, no, no, Bernie

704
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:11,330
Dave想说的是 你应该...
what Dave's tryin' to say, ya should just...

705
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:12,911
绕着码头兜圈子
motor around the harbor,

706
00:40:12,936 --> 00:40:15,505
就说你尽力了 但实在出不去
say you tried to get out, and couldn't.

707
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,282
懂吗
Ya know?

708
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:23,717
谢谢 Ryder先生 谢谢你
Thank you, Mr. Ryder, thank you..

709
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:27,769
但是 Stello先生 我会全力以赴出去的
But, Mr. Stello, I'm gonna do my best to... to get out there.

710
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,632
我不知道是否能成功 但一定会尽力的
I don't know if I will, but I'm gonna try.

711
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:02,297
好吧
Okay.

712
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:06,305
Richie要参加 还有谁
I guess Richie's in? Who else?

713
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:11,384
不行吧 Gus 你头都快抬不起来了
I don't know, Gus, you can hardly lift your head.

714
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,852
除了我你还能带谁 Bernie
Who else you gonna take, Bernie?

715
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:15,082
Fitz是仅剩的引擎师了
Fitz is the only other engineman left.

716
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:16,704
而他只有三级
And he's only third class,

717
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,225
又缺乏经验
and he don't got the experience.

718
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:24,094
我愿意去 我... 我...
I... I'll go, yeah, I... I can... I can...

719
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:24,867
我可以的
I can do the job.

720
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:27,076
我可以的 你... 你不能去
I mean, I can do it, what, I mean, you... you can't go.

721
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:29,776
你病得太重了 Gus
You... you're as sick as a dog, Gus.

722
00:41:31,548 --> 00:41:33,612
他说得对 Gus
He's right, Gus.

723
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:38,548
再来一个
One more.

724
00:41:43,306 --> 00:41:44,470
好吧 总得有人出海
Well, someone has to go out there

725
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:46,501
去救那些人 对吧
and save those guys, right?

726
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:48,571
我就是为此入这行的
That's why I signed up.

727
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:51,282
我想这是我的机会来了
Guess now's my chance.

728
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:56,001
石马号灯塔船的水手 Ervin Maske
Seaman Ervin Maske, Stone Horse lightship.

729
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:13,766
抽水泵的速度跟不上了
Pumps aren't keepin' up.

730
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:16,532
水再涨高三英尺
Three more feet...

731
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:20,254
引擎就要灭了
then we lose the engines.

732
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,854
你能把那锅炉完全锁紧吗
Can you lock that boiler on full?

733
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,589
你以为用几根绳子外加手工做的舵柄
You're crazy to think you can steer a boat

734
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:26,774
就能驾驶这艘船 真是疯了 小子
with a few ropes and a handmade tiller, Bud.

735
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:30,219
你有更好的主意吗 我洗耳恭听
You got a better idea? I'm all ears.

736
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:35,251
那边 大概一英里处有片沙洲
There! A shoal about a mile distance.

737
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,227
我们能过去的
We can make that!

738
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:39,189
左舵十五度
Rudder, 15 degrees to port

739
00:43:39,214 --> 00:43:41,232
正面过去的话要半速
half speed if we wanna hit it head-on.

740
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:42,736
得让船转八十度
Gotta make her turn 80 degrees

741
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:45,446
罗盘转到三百一十
on the compass to 310.

742
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:50,572
左舵十五度 半速前进
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed,

743
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,607
罗盘转八十度到三百一十
80 degrees to 310 on compass.

744
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,459
左舵十五度 半速前进
15 degrees port, half speed,

745
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:57,505
罗盘转八十度到三百一十
80 degrees to 310 on compass.

746
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:59,427
左舵十五度 半速前进
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed,

747
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:01,295
罗盘转八十度到三百一十
80 degrees to 310 on the compass.

748
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:03,489
左舵十五度 半速前进
Rudder, 15 degrees port half speed...

749
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:06,094
左舵十五度 半速前进
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed...

750
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:10,860
左舵十五度 半速前进
Rudder, 15 degrees port, half speed...

751
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:15,251
左舵十五度 半速前进
15 degrees port, half speed...

752
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:28,122
左舵十五度 半速前进
Rudder, 15 degrees port, at half speed,

753
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:29,680
罗盘转八十度到三百一十
80 degrees to 310 on compass.

754
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:31,208
谢谢 Eldon
Thank you, Eldon.

755
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,530
好了 大伙
All right, you guys

756
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:48,661
现在开始拉 拉 加油
now pull, pull, pull, pull, come on!

757
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,022
我们是要乘那条船去救一艘更大的船吧
Please tell me we're takin' that boat to a bigger boat.

758
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,909
- 你执行过救援任务吗 - 没有
- You ever been on a rescue mission before? - No.

759
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,150
我通常负责刮油漆
Usually I just chip paint

760
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,978
有时候负责做饭
sometimes I cook for the boys.

761
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:27,861
很好
Great!

762
00:45:31,558 --> 00:45:33,932
好了 你站在这个洞里
All right, you... you take the glory hole.

763
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:35,495
我叫Maske Ervin Maske
Maske, Ervin Maske.

764
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,489
Ervin 记住了
Ervin, yeah.

765
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:41,017
Richie 看好时机放下锚绳
Richie, drop the mooring line when you can.

766
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:48,302
Pendleton号最后的已知位置在这里
The last known position of the Pendleton is here.

767
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:50,289
所以我觉得 当我们越过沙洲
So I... I figure once we cross the bar,

768
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,798
考虑到水流的因素
I reckon with the currents...

769
00:45:51,823 --> 00:45:54,816
它大概会漂流到这里 距我们六英里处
she'll have drifted about here, that's 6 miles from us.

770
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:06,782
你觉得Bernie能带我们用这条船越过沙洲吗
So you think Bernie can get us out past bar on this?

771
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:09,160
我从没见过这样的天气
I never seen anything like it.

772
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:11,219
他只要能保证我们
Yeah, I mean he's just gotta be sure that

773
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:13,738
不会翻船就可以了
he doesn't pitchpole us, that's all.

774
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:16,785
沙洲那儿的海浪
The power in the waves in that bar

775
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,356
能把船掀上天 让你翻上好几个筋斗
they can pick ya up, they can turn ya end for end

776
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:20,973
翻个不停
over and over again.

777
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:25,645
不可能活下来的 绝对会翻船
There's no way to survive that, that's a pitchpole.

778
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:43,322
Fitz 准备好了吗
Hey, Fitz, are we good?

779
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:45,518
好了 试一下吧
All right, give it a shot!

780
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:55,716
- 解开绳索 - 解开了
- Free the lines! - Lines free.

781
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:37,809
Bernie出海了吗 Gus
Did Bernie go out, Gus?

782
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,722
Miriam 你来这里干嘛
Miriam, what are you doing here?

783
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:44,934
- 他出海了吗 - 是的 Cluff派他去的
- Did he? - Yeah, Cluff sent him.

784
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,189
我要跟他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

785
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:50,232
- 跟谁谈 - Cluff
- Who? - Cluff.

786
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:52,861
你们的指挥官 他在哪儿
Your commanding officer, where is he?

787
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:54,081
我要知道Bernie在哪里
I want to find out where Bernie is,

788
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,242
我很担心他
I'm worried about him.

789
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:57,223
我们本该结婚的
We're supposed to get married.

790
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,107
Miriam 没有哪个姑娘会像你这样...
Miriam, this isn't what the other girls do...

791
00:48:00,758 --> 00:48:02,141
妻子们都不会
or wives.

792
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:06,428
她们不会来这里 不会这样的
They don't come in here, and they don't do this.

793
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:09,723
那又怎样
So?

794
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:17,417
如果你愿意的话 我觉得...
If you want, I guess... you...

795
00:48:17,442 --> 00:48:21,331
你可以在这里等着听消息
you can wait in here, listen to what's going on.

796
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:25,511
坐吧
Sit down.

797
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:14,078
海潮涨起来了 会把我们推离沙洲的
Tide's risin', coulda work us off that shoal.

798
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:15,307
我们要硬冲了
We need to hit it hard.

799
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,749
是啊 只能这样了
Yeah, there's no other way.

800
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:20,661
海浪
Wave!

801
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:42,543
你感觉到了吗 船在漂流
You feel that? She's drifting.

802
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:45,562
舵柄一定坏了
Must've lost the tiller.

803
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:46,914
我们得减速
We gotta slow her headway

804
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:50,328
不然会错过沙洲的
or we're gonna miss the shoal for good.

805
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,119
关闭调速阀 减小推进力
Close the governor valve, cut the propulsion,

806
00:49:53,144 --> 00:49:54,416
锁紧锅炉
we gotta isolate the boiler.

807
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:57,002
里面的蒸汽都得留着
We gotta conserve everything she's got left.

808
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,151
我跟你说了 这船就是走霉运
I keep tellin' ya... this boat's just bad luck.

809
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:06,148
这和运气... 没关系
It's got nothing... to do... with luck.

810
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:42,346
查塔姆站 这里是CG-36-500号船 收到请回复

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,926
到了通向查塔姆沙洲的航道 完毕

816
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,813
越过沙洲是怎么回事
What's it mean going over that bar?

817
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:58,101
Miriam 别这样
Now, Miriam, don't do this to yourself.

818
00:50:58,126 --> 00:50:59,533
为什么不让我问
Why not?

819
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,627
为什么 Gus
Why not, Gus?

820
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,698
如果我要和他共度一生 我就得知道
If I'm gonna be with him, I wanna know.

821
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:12,510
- 你就是那个穿着熊大衣的姑娘 是吗 - 对
- You're the girl with the bear-coat, right? - Yeah...

822
00:51:14,106 --> 00:51:16,557
没错 是我
Yeah, that's me.

00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,862
你要告诉我那里的情况吗
You gonna tell me what's it's like out there?

824
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:28,314
那片沙洲上的浅滩变幻莫测
Shoals on that bar are never in the same place twice.

825
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:31,202
海潮带着巨浪
Flood currents carryin' them big ocean swells

826
00:51:31,227 --> 00:51:32,902
遇到浅滩时
that rise up when they hit

827
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:35,323
会排山倒海般地冲击沙洲
the shallows crash up against that bar.

828
00:51:35,348 --> 00:51:38,798
退潮也会对沙洲形成冲击
The outgoing tide crashes up against that bar.

829
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:42,669
那个人... 那个人不该让他们
That, uh... That man shouldn't have sent them out

830
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:45,274
在这样的暴风雪天气去闯滩的
to cross that bar in a storm like this.

831
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:48,876
他们也许能调头回来
Maybe they can turn back,

832
00:51:49,325 --> 00:51:51,657
也许在那之前就迷航了
maybe they get lost before.

833
00:51:51,853 --> 00:51:53,657
但没法越过沙洲
Can't get out.

834
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,931
你很了解Bernie 是吗
You know Bernie, right?

835
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,892
你知道他不会迷航的
You know he won't get lost out there.

836
00:52:03,629 --> 00:52:05,954
你知道 他一向遵守规则
You know he follows the rules.

837
00:52:06,494 --> 00:52:09,501
是啊 我们都知道
Yeah, we know.

838
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:11,794
我们等下也会到码头去
We all going down to the pier soon,

839
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:14,423
看看有什么能做的
see if there's anything we can do down there.

840
00:52:18,063 --> 00:52:20,415
也欢迎你来
Welcome to come.

841
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:30,380
Miriam

843
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,731
Miriam
Miriam?

844
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:39,405
抱歉 请问您是Cluff中校吗
Excuse me, are you Commander Cluff?

845
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,655
你是谁
Who are you?

846
00:52:40,697 --> 00:52:42,712
我是Miriam Pentinen Bernie Webber的女朋友
I'm Miriam Pentinen, Bernie Webber's girlfriend,

847
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:44,134
我想请您命令Bernie回来
I want you to call Bernie back in.

848
00:52:44,176 --> 00:52:45,168
他为了你来请求我
The girl he was askin' me about,

849
00:52:45,222 --> 00:52:47,160
你知道他要请求我什么吗
do you know what he was gonna ask me?

850
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:49,481
请求您批准我们结婚
For your permission to marry me.

851
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,377
这事你们俩加上上帝同意就行了
Well, that's between you, him and your god.

852
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,912
让我批准只是走个形式
Asking me is just a formality

853
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,480
只要他愿意就可以娶你
he can marry you all he wants.

854
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,168
他不知道吗 不过你不能待在这里 小姐
Don't he know that? But you can't be in here, Miss.

855
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,028
是Bernie
It's Bernie.

856
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,310
查塔姆沙洲就在正前方 完毕
Chatham bar dead ahead. Over.

857
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,124
36-500 这里是查塔姆站
36-500, Station Chatham,

858
00:53:04,149 --> 00:53:07,653
请按指示向Pendleton号船尾前行
Proceed as directed, towards Pendleton stern.

859
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,752
我没听清 查塔姆站
I didn't copy that, Station Chatham,

860
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:11,497
这里的海况很不好
the conditions hazardous.

861
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,895
你既然让他出去送死 为何还要批准我们结婚呢
Why give us permission if you're sending him out to die?

862
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:19,395
胡说些什么 Gouthro 把她带出去
What the hell! Gouthro, get her out of here!

863
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:23,061
长官 从接到呼叫到现在
Sir, winds have gone from 40 to 60

864
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:25,156
风力已经从四十节增强到六十节
since the call first come in.
此处风力单位可能是英里/小时或海里/小时(节) 美式一海里约为1.15英里 考虑到海上背景可能是以节为单位 40节到60节相当于八级大风到十级暴风

865
00:53:25,156 --> 00:53:25,180
此处风力单位可能是英里/小时或海里/小时(节) 美式一海里约为1.15英里 考虑到海上背景可能是以节为单位 40节到60节相当于八级大风到十级暴风

866
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:26,180
也就是说一小时内可能会增强到飓风
That's gonna be hurricane strength in an hour.
十二级风

867
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,210
也就是说一小时内可能会增强到飓风
That's gonna be hurricane strength in an hour.

868
00:53:27,235 --> 00:53:28,663
Gouthro 他有令在身
Gouthro, he's got his orders.

869
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:29,984
你带她出去
You get her out of here,

870
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:31,419
然后自己去睡觉
and you get yourself to bed,

871
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:33,383
你病了 不该待在这里
you're too sick to be in here.

872
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,763
36-500号 这里是查塔姆站 继续前进越过沙洲
36-500, Station Chatham, proceed over the bar.

873
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:48,074
重复一遍 继续前进
I repeat, proceed.

874
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,448
成功后 直接向南行驶
Once over, travel directly south.

875
00:53:50,473 --> 00:53:52,795
雷达信号断断续续 但有一个点出现在
The radar's intermittent but it's showing a pip

876
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,562
Monomoy Point以东十到十二英里处
10 to 12 miles east of Monomoy Point,

877
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:57,788
向南行驶 完毕
moving south. Over.

878
00:53:59,428 --> 00:54:05,252
查塔姆站 这里是500... 收到
Station Chatham, this is the 500... copy that.

879
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,465
大家说的我都听到了
I hear what everyone's saying.

880
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:23,153
你根本不知道自己在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

881
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:25,349
你说什么
Excuse me?

882
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:28,632
也许... 也许因为你不是本地人
Maybe... maybe it's because you're not from here.

883
00:54:28,657 --> 00:54:29,602
不知道海上的情况
You don't know what it's like out there.

884
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,187
你又怎么会知道
What the hell would you know

885
00:54:31,212 --> 00:54:34,293
海上是什么情况 小姐
what it's like out there, Miss? Hmm?

886
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:36,695
请命令他们回来吧
Please, just call them back.

887
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,858
你觉得嫁给一名
What do you think it's gonna be like

888
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:40,074
海岸警卫队员会过一种怎样的生活
being married to a Coast Guard man?

889
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:41,702
请命令他们回来吧
Please, just call them back.

890
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:42,875
每次他一出海
You gonna come in here,

891
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,719
你就要失魂落魄地跑来这里吗
scared, every time he out in the water?

892
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:46,188
请命令他们回来吧
Please call them back.

893
00:54:46,213 --> 00:54:48,834
你不属于这里
You, don't belong here.

894
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:51,309
请命令他们回来吧
Please call them back.

895
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:54,212
出去 离开我的哨站
Get out of here! Get out of my station!

896
00:54:54,238 --> 00:54:56,241
回自己的家去 小姐
And go home to where you belong, Miss.

897
00:54:56,266 --> 00:54:57,325
请命令他们回来吧
Please call them back.

898
00:54:57,354 --> 00:54:59,871
滚出哨站
Get out of my station!

899
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,230
我们过头了
Shoal's getting behind us.

900
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,030
现在只有急转弯才有机会
Only chance now is a harder turn,

901
00:56:06,055 --> 00:56:08,132
如果铁链撑得住的话 但...
if the chains hold, but...

902
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:11,089
也可能会让我们翻船
it could capsize us.

903
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:30,429
干得不错 孩子
That's good, boy.

904
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:46,926
站远点 伙计们
You need to stand clear, boys!

905
00:56:46,951 --> 00:56:49,513
要是钩环崩开 铁链断了
If those shackles crack and these chains snap

906
00:56:49,538 --> 00:56:51,769
会把你们劈成两半的
and it'll rip right through ya.

907
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,956
开始
Here we go.

908
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:04,871
- 船动了 - 没错
- Got her moving! - Yeah!

909
00:57:15,151 --> 00:57:16,955
听见了吗
You hear that?

910
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,400
就是这声音... 沙洲的声音
That's it! That's... that's the bar.

911
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,900
还有几分钟 伙计们
Couple of minutes now, boys.

912
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,078
# 那时我是小儿郎 #
When I was a little boy

913
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,159
# 妈妈如此对我讲 #
So my mother told me

914
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,596
# 我要 起航 起航 #
To me! Way, haul away

915
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,034
# 起航 #
Haul away

916
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,268
# 我们要起航 Joe #
We'll haul away Joe

917
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,110
# 起初我遇到个北方妞 #
Now, first I met a Yankee girl

918
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,309
# 又肥又胖又懒惰 我要#
She was fat and lazy To me!

919
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,591
# 起航 起航 #
Way haul away

920
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,116
# 我们要起航 Joe #
We'll haul away Joe

921
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:13,800
# 后来遇到个爱尔兰妞 #
And then I met an Irish girl

922
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,236
# 差点没让我抓狂 我要 #
She damn near drove me crazy To me!

923
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,596
# 起航 起航 #
Way haul away

924
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,030
# 我们要起航 Joe #
We'll haul away Joe

925
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,438
# 起航 起航 #
Now way, haul away

926
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,677
# 我们要寻找明媚的风光 #
We're bound for better weather

927
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,760
# 我要 #
To me!

928
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,593
# 起航 起航 #
Way haul away

929
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,632
# 我们要起航 Joe #
We'll haul away Joe

930
00:59:01,355 --> 00:59:02,730
喂 伙计们
Hey, hey, boys,

931
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:06,252
我们马上要看不清了
we're not gonna be able to see much, all right?

932
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:07,894
所以只能靠听那些海浪
So we'll have to listen to those waves

933
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:11,633
打在沙洲上的声音... 来推算它的时间
hittin' that bar... gotta time it.

934
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:15,140
等它平静下来时 我们就向前冲
So I'm gonna wait for a lull and then we go.

935
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,423
我们相信你 船长
We got faith in you, Skip!

936
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:21,308
只要你准备好就往前冲 Bernie 好吗
Anytime you're ready, you just go, Bernie, all right?

937
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,814
罗盘不见了
The compass is gone.

938
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:26,765
Fitzy 引擎熄火了
Fitzy! The engine died!

939
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,874
- 我来搞 - 你不行
- I got it, I got it. - Nah, you don't.

940
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:43,298
你们只有五秒钟
You got about five seconds, boys!

941
01:01:43,323 --> 01:01:45,715
它是重力式的 所以已经搞不清上下了
It's gravity-fed, it doesn't know... which way is up and down.

942
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,602
我知道
I know!

943
01:01:52,759 --> 01:01:54,774
好了 发动引擎
Come on, fire it up!

944
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:18,628
Maske 回后面来
Maske! Get back here.

945
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,365
海潮在涨 它会带我们过去的
Tide's rising! It'll get us through.

946
01:02:29,884 --> 01:02:32,888
但我要看一下怎么过
But let me know what's coming.

947
01:04:25,558 --> 01:04:28,233
Fitz 我们闯过沙洲了
Hey Fitz! We made it over the bar.

948
01:04:28,258 --> 01:04:30,604
回到探照灯那边去吧
Back to spotlight!

949
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:35,568
来了
Coming out!

950
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:51,518
我们转得太晚了
We turned too late!

951
01:04:53,478 --> 01:04:55,622
得争分夺秒了
We gotta buy that time back!

952
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:58,686
告诉Sybert 要在两分钟内转三十度
Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees in the next two minutes

953
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:01,245
不然就会错过浅滩
or we'll miss that shoal!

954
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:04,972
两分钟内转三十度
30 degrees in the next two minutes!

955
01:05:04,997 --> 01:05:06,439
两分钟内转三十度
30 degrees in the next two minutes!

956
01:05:06,464 --> 01:05:08,042
两分钟内转三十度
30 degrees in the next two minutes!

957
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:10,386
两分钟内转三十度
30 degrees in the next two minutes!

958
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:20,269
我们得开倒档
We're puttin' her in reverse.

959
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:22,886
让海水推着我们走
You're gonna let the ocean push us.

960
01:05:23,672 --> 01:05:25,910
抓紧
Hold on.

961
01:06:29,346 --> 01:06:31,647
你得抓紧了 Eldon
You may wanna brace yourself, Eldon.

962
01:06:33,858 --> 01:06:35,838
三百一十八
318.

963
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:42,699
三百一十六
316.

964
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:46,512
一旦搁浅就关掉引擎
Close her down as soon as she hits!

965
01:06:48,121 --> 01:06:50,269
三百一十二
312.

966
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:03,983
先生们 都抓紧了
Gentlemen! Brace yourselves.

967
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:06,921
抓紧了
Hold on!

968
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:14,965
快停
Now!

969
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:19,645
好了...
Well...

970
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:28,612
你成功了 居然做到了 Sybert先生
You did it! It bloody well worked, Mr. Sybert!

971
01:08:31,044 --> 01:08:32,458
别让水灌进
We gotta keep the water away

972
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,605
引擎进风口
from the air inlets for the engine.

973
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:38,270
如果失去了电力 就无法使用抽水泵了
If we lose power, we'll lose our pumps.

974
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,998
而且我担心船舱进水太多
And I'm afraid we're taking on so much water

975
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:44,523
船的自重会把我们拖离浅滩
the weight will pull us right back off the shoal.

976
01:08:48,101 --> 01:08:51,379
船突然停了是不是反而不习惯了 Eldon
Feels funny to not be moving around, huh, Eldon?

977
01:08:54,315 --> 01:08:57,676
好吧 大家干活吧
All right, let's get to it.

978
01:09:22,256 --> 01:09:24,741
我们要去寄宿站 怎么了
We're heading down to the lodge. Everything okay?

979
01:09:24,766 --> 01:09:27,151
- 住手 - 安静 天哪 让我安静会儿
- Stop it! - Quiet down now, my God, give me a break.

980
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:28,380
我在回家的路上
I was on my way home,

981
01:09:28,405 --> 01:09:30,125
汽车滑到沟里了
my car spun out into a ditch.

982
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:32,198
帮帮我
I need some help.

983
01:09:32,223 --> 01:09:33,866
好的 我们就住在附近
Yeah, all right, we live near here.

984
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:34,922
你可以跟我们回家
We can go back to my house,

985
01:09:34,947 --> 01:09:38,852
我打电话给我哥 让他帮你把车拖出来 上车吧
I'll call my brother, he can pull you out. Jump in.

986
01:09:41,356 --> 01:09:43,708
- 谢谢你 - 你没穿大衣
- Thank you. - You don't got a coat?

987
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:45,404
把这个挪到一边 我们正要把它送到
You can move that, we're bringing it down to

988
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:48,020
St. Martin那里去 是为幸存者准备的
St. Martin's in case there're any survivors.

989
01:09:50,447 --> 01:09:52,829
我... 把大衣拉在海岸警卫队哨站里了
I... I left my coat at the Coast Guard station.

990
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:54,176
你男人在那工作吗
You got a man there?

991
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,572
住手
Stop it.

992
01:09:58,871 --> 01:10:01,550
他现在不在那里 他...
He is not there now right now, it's, um...

993
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:07,331
- 他叫Bernie Webber - 哦 Bernie是个好人
- It's Bernie Webber. - Yeah, Bernie, he's a good man.

994
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:27,224
没有罗盘没法找到他们 Bernie
We can't find them without a compass, Bernie!

995
01:10:27,854 --> 01:10:30,685
我们根本不知道他们在哪
We got no idea where they are!

996
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:35,122
抓稳
Hold on.

997
01:11:05,972 --> 01:11:08,073
- 你没事吧 - 没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

998
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:12,828
- 你呢 - 我现在好极了 Bernie
- You okay? - I'm havin' a great time now, Bernie!

999
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:15,120
太好玩了
Lot of fun.

1000
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:21,578
各位抓紧
Brace yourselves!

1001
01:11:33,996 --> 01:11:37,683
简直... 简直太过瘾了
Whole lotta... A whole lot of fun here.

1002
01:11:45,852 --> 01:11:50,086
- 给 用这个 - 拿到了 老爹
- C'mon, take it. Use it. - Got it, Pop.

1003
01:11:55,413 --> 01:11:56,824
抽水泵停了
We lost the pumps.

1004
01:11:56,849 --> 01:11:57,290
水泵过载触发了断路器
The pumps are tripping the breakers.

1005
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:58,278
在电路过载时自动切断电路以保护电器设备
水泵过载触发了断路器
The pumps are tripping the breakers.

1006
01:11:58,278 --> 01:11:58,303
在电路过载时自动切断电路以保护电器设备

1007
01:11:58,303 --> 01:12:01,372
我去检查接口
I'll go check the connections.
在电路过载时自动切断电路以保护电器设备

1008
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:02,772
在电路过载时自动切断电路以保护电器设备

1009
01:12:02,772 --> 01:12:03,090
灯给我
Give me the light.
在电路过载时自动切断电路以保护电器设备

1010
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,144
灯给我
Give me the light.

1011
01:12:05,169 --> 01:12:06,729
这根本毫无用处 蠢货
It's not worth a damn, Bouloo.

1012
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,450
有时候我真希望听不懂你在说什么
Sometimes, I wish I didn't understand you.

1013
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,481
Sybert 怎么回事
Sybert, what's going on?

1014
01:12:14,823 --> 01:12:17,801
我们开动了所有的水泵
We're using every pump we've got.

1015
01:12:17,826 --> 01:12:20,603
只有把断路器卡住 这样水泵就不会触发过载保护了
We jammed the breakers so the pumps wouldn't trip them.

1016
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,579
水再涨高两英尺
We've got about two feet till the water

1017
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:24,045
就要灌进引擎进风口了
hits those air inlets to the engines

1018
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,294
到那时船就动不了了
and then the ship's dead.

1019
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,685
- 天哪 - 你听见了吗
- Jesus Christ. - Do you hear that?

1020
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,959
海水在涨潮 会把我们推离浅滩的
That's the tide's rising, gonna work us off this shoal.

1021
01:12:29,984 --> 01:12:33,607
但还算幸运 至少争取了一些时间
But luck. This'll at least give us some time.

1022
01:12:33,632 --> 01:12:34,858
对吗 Sybert先生
Isn't that right, Mr. Sybert?

1023
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,278
没错 的确 伙计
That right, sure it is, boy.

1024
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:39,103
只要发电机继续工作
Yeah, as long as we got generators

1025
01:12:39,128 --> 01:12:41,013
维持抽水泵运转
keeping the pumps going.

1026
01:12:42,306 --> 01:12:43,882
给那些来营救我们的人
Buy whoever might be coming to find us,

1027
01:12:43,907 --> 01:12:44,473
多争取一点时间
we'll buy a little time.

1028
01:12:44,516 --> 01:12:46,008
你想做老大 Sybert
You wanted to be the man, Sybert,

1029
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:47,505
现在你是老大了 对吗
now you're the man, right?

1030
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:50,919
但你家中没有老婆 没有孩子
Except you got no wife, you got no kids back home.

1031
01:12:51,648 --> 01:12:55,935
孤身一人 舱底就是你的家
You're a single man... always hiding down below,

1032
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,642
你有什么可失去的
what do you gotta lose?

1033
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,138
行了 Brown
All right, that's enough, Brown.

1034
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:02,997
我也害怕 Brown
I'm scared, too, Brown.

1035
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,872
和你一样 我也有自己的生活
I got a life, the same as you.

1036
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:14,419
只是觉得谈论这些毫无用处
Just don't see the point in sitting around talking about it.

1037
01:13:17,967 --> 01:13:20,935
查塔姆站 这里是36-500号
Station Chatham, 36-500,

1038
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,704
查塔姆站 这里是36-500号 是否收到
Station Chatham, 36-500, do you copy?

1039
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:28,249
查塔姆站 这里是Bangs队长 CG-36-383号

Pollock lightship, CG-36-500, do you copy?

1041
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:36,570
他们为什么听不见 Bernie 我们明明能听见他们
Why can't they hear us, Bernie? We can hear them!

1042
01:13:36,595 --> 01:13:39,429
风急浪高 航速为零
Seas are too high, zero headway.

1043
01:13:39,454 --> 01:13:40,966
查塔姆站 是否收到
Station Chatham, do you copy?

1044
01:13:40,991 --> 01:13:42,826
重复一遍 我们正在返航
Repeat, we're coming home.

1045
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,738
查塔姆站 回复36-383号 返航至老港
Station Chatham to 36-383, return to Old Harbor.

1046
01:13:46,763 --> 01:13:50,257
Pollock灯塔船 这里是CG-36-500号 是否收到
Pollock lightship, CG-36-500, do you copy?

1047
01:13:50,282 --> 01:13:52,718
我们只能靠自己了
We are all alone.

1048
01:13:52,743 --> 01:13:54,444
你听见了Bangs在无线电里说的
You heard, Bangs' on the Radio.

1049
01:13:54,475 --> 01:13:56,877
看来他没能闯过去 又回去了
It sounds like he couldn't get out, going back in,

1050
01:13:56,902 --> 01:13:59,372
风暴越来越大
the storm is getting worse.

1051
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,352
我们也该回去 Webber
We should turn back in, Webber.

1052
01:14:02,377 --> 01:14:03,805
Bernie 他们认为不可能
Look, Bernie, we already made it out

1053
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:07,231
做到的事我们已经做到了
further than anybody thought was possible!

1054
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:11,760
也许Richie说得对 也许是该回去了
Maybe Richie's right. Maybe we should just go back.

1055
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:14,541
风力达八到九级 重复一遍
Winds at force of 8 to 9, repeat,

1056
01:14:14,566 --> 01:14:18,366
风力已达八到九级 有特大暴风雪
winds at force of 8 to 9, heavy snow squalls.

1057
01:14:18,391 --> 01:14:20,242
你听见Bangs说什么了
You heard Bangs on the radio!

1058
01:14:20,267 --> 01:14:24,231
我们没有罗盘 也没法联络
We have no compass! we have no way to communicate!

1059
01:14:26,781 --> 01:14:31,531
- 你真是... - 怎么了 我怎么了 Richie
- You are... - What? What? I'm what, Richie?

1060
01:14:32,095 --> 01:14:34,220
我不是把大家都带出这么远了吗
I got us out this far, didn't I?

1061
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:38,765
不是Bangs 不是Cluff 不是别人... 我做到了
Not Bangs or Cluff, not nobody else... I did it!

1062
01:14:44,538 --> 01:14:46,873
我们做到了 Richie
We did it, Richie.

1063
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:52,389
你想要返航吗
You wanna turn back around?

1064
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:57,775
不 现在不能 已经走了这么远
No, not now, we came too far.

1065
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,428
我们不能放弃他们
We are not giving up on them.

1066
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:05,108
有我在就不行
Not on my watch.

1067
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,092
各就各位吧
Just do your job.

1068
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:15,457
Fitz 关掉探照灯 我们要摸黑行驶
Hey, Fitz! Turn off the beam, Fitz, we'll run her dark.

1069
01:15:15,482 --> 01:15:17,396
关了灯更容易看见
Better shot at seeing light from the Pendleton

1070
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:19,565
Pendleton号上的灯光
if we're running dark.

1071
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:29,103
当心
Watch it!

1072
01:15:33,998 --> 01:15:36,318
回来 Fitz
Get back here! Fitz!

1073
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:39,687
快回来
Get your butts back here!

1074
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:42,888
我的帽子没了
I lost my hat!

1075
01:16:07,444 --> 01:16:09,264
你没事吧
You okay?

1076
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:16,494
没事 我只是累了 走吧
Yeah, yeah, I'm just tired. Come on.

1077
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,408
你们俩到卧室去玩吧
You kids go on and play in the bedroom.

1078
01:16:23,433 --> 01:16:25,577
小姐 我去给我哥打电话 你和他们一起等着
You can wait with them, miss, while I call my brother.

1079
01:16:25,597 --> 01:16:28,979
谢谢 叫我Miriam好了
Thanks, please call me Miriam.

1080
01:16:45,803 --> 01:16:46,818
我想听收音机
You think your mother would mind

1081
01:16:46,843 --> 01:16:48,998
你们的妈妈会介意吗
if I turn on the radio?

1082
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:58,256
波士顿海岸警卫队 这里是Unimak号
Coast Guard Boston, this is the Unimak.

1083
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,788
我们现在已到Mercer号船头
We're at the Mercer bow now,

1084
01:16:59,817 --> 01:17:01,399
有Yakutat号支援
here in support of the Yakutat.

1085
01:17:01,424 --> 01:17:03,986
四名Mercer号船员从甲板跳下海
Four Mercer crew men jumped from the deck,

1086
01:17:04,015 --> 01:17:05,220

再说一遍 四人失联
Repeat, four men lost.

1088

有些船员出现了低温症

1089
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:14,699
天亮后我们再开始新一轮营救 完毕
We're gonna for daybreak to attempt another rescue. Over.

1090
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:18,716
听这些没什么好处 Miriam

我说过 Bernie是个好人
Like I said, Bernie, he's a good man.

1097
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:54,318

They were out fishin' marlin near Nantucket Sound

1100
01:17:59,036 --> 01:18:00,325
船进了水

1110
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,313

1111
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,513
# 坐下吧 坐下吧 #
Sit down, sit down, sit dow

1112
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:57,179
你知道她是谁吗
Do you know who she is?

1113
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,381
Carly 不是Bernie的错 不是任何人的错
Ain't Bernie's fault, Carly, nobody's fault,

1114
01:20:00,406 --> 01:20:02,890
不然她也能怪你
Be like her blaming you.

1115
01:20:03,187 --> 01:20:04,622
为什么怪我
For what?

1116
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:06,412
是你告诉他们那里还有一艘船
You're the one that told them there's another ship out there,

1117
01:20:06,437 --> 01:20:09,031

再把你们搁在海上了
we're gonna get you all up there.

1225
01:35:31,778 --> 01:35:34,184
CG-36-500号 这是查塔姆站
CG-36-500, this is Station Chatham.

1226
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:36,308
Webber 我命令你
Webber, your orders are to proceed

1227
01:35:36,358 --> 01:35:37,688
向东北方向行驶五英里
five miles northeast

1228
01:35:37,713 --> 01:35:40,895
将幸存者转移到Pollock号
and unload all survivors onto the Pollock.

1229
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,842
他好像切断了无线电 Cluff先生
Sounds like there's a cut off his radio, Mr. Cluff...

1230
01:35:58,145 --> 01:36:00,112
他要按自己的方式来
he's going it on his own.

1231
01:36:01,328 --> 01:36:03,378
Bernie Webber
Bernie Webber.

1232
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:05,574
你料得到吗
What do you know?

1233
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,101
他们要怎么样才回得来
How are they gonna find their way home?

1234
01:36:07,124 --> 01:36:09,631
他肯定关了无线电
He must have shut off the radio.

1235
01:36:11,367 --> 01:36:14,835
- 可怜的人 - 不敢相信怎么会这样
- Poor, poor boys. - I can't believe this is happenin'.

1236
01:36:22,722 --> 01:36:24,870
车上还有东西没拿下来
Some more stuff in the car.

1237
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:34,947
停电了
The power's out.

1238
01:36:35,728 --> 01:36:39,041
整个城都停电了
The whole town, the power's out.

1239
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:43,283
- 比去年还糟糕 - 他们回不来了
- It's worse than last year. - They'll never make it.

1240
01:37:00,658 --> 01:37:03,290
咱们去码头吧
Let's get to the pier.

1241
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:15,921
没有罗盘你们是怎么找到我们的
How did you find us without a compass?

1242
01:37:16,083 --> 01:37:22,570
我们... 只是顺着海流走
We... we just jogged along with the seasonal currents.

1243
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:28,450
可能比较幸运吧
I think we just got lucky.

1244
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:31,101
- 是啊 - 是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah...

1245
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,004
幸运
Lucky.

1246
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:40,554
那你知道怎么回去吗
So, you know how you get home?

1247
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,914
说实话 我也不确定
To be honest with ya, I'm not sure.

1248
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:47,945
我... 没有听从上级的命令
Just... disobeyed all my ranking officers.

1249
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:52,046
他们不了解情况 我比他们清楚一些 对吧
They don't know, so I guess I... I'd better, right?

1250
01:37:52,093 --> 01:37:54,700
来的时候风是从左面吹来的
Had the wind on my left goin' out,

1251
01:37:54,725 --> 01:37:59,131
我想 如果一直保持风在右面
Figure if I... . Keep it her on my right,

1252
01:37:59,156 --> 01:38:01,201
方向应该不会错
we oughta be headin' the right direction.

1253
01:38:03,492 --> 01:38:05,188
我们只要跟随岸上的灯光
We just follow the lights onshore,

1254
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:07,701
跟随岸上的一切灯光
follow all the lights onshore.

1255
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:23,627
我们都靠你了 船长
Well, we are in your hands, Cap'n.

1256
01:38:32,675 --> 01:38:34,487
大家听着
Listen up.

1257
01:38:38,092 --> 01:38:40,677
我要向岸边前进
I'll put the sea behind us.

1258
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:45,379
让海水推着我们走 直到找到陆地
Just let it push us along, till we land up somewhere.

1259
01:38:45,404 --> 01:38:47,619
风暴... 风暴在逐渐平息 所以
The storm's... the storm's easing' up, boys, so...

1260
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:50,595
我们只需找寻岸上的灯光
we just look for the lights on the shore to guide us in.

1261
01:38:50,645 --> 01:38:54,073
即使要走到遥远的Nobska灯塔
Even if we have to go so far as Nobska Point.

1262
01:38:54,098 --> 01:38:57,355
也要往前走 我们一定会找到陆地的
So be it! We just gonna find land!

1263
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:04,654
今天可是无比漫长的一天 对吧
Been one heck of a long day, right fellas?

1264
01:39:04,983 --> 01:39:08,357
的确如此
Yeah, it sure has!

1265
01:39:10,154 --> 01:39:13,271
但是你们要对我有信心
But don't you give up hope on me now.

1266
01:39:15,091 --> 01:39:18,044
这船不错 会让我们度过难关的
It's a good boat, she'll get us through.

1267
01:39:19,717 --> 01:39:23,590
我们会把你们带回家 我们都会回家
We'll get you home, okay? We're all goin' home.

1268
01:39:24,502 --> 01:39:26,731
我们相信你 船长
We're with you, Skipper.

1269
01:42:50,775 --> 01:42:53,562
大家像她一样把车灯打开
Keep the lights on, like she's doin'!

1270
01:42:53,587 --> 01:42:54,876
快点 开灯
Quick! Turn your lights on!

1271
01:42:54,901 --> 01:42:57,587
大家都把灯打开
Turn on the lights, everyone.

1272
01:42:58,667 --> 01:43:01,462
把灯打开 他们就能看到我们了
More light, so that they can see us.

1273
01:43:50,483 --> 01:43:53,209
看来我们已越过沙洲了
I think we made it over the bar.

1274
01:43:55,917 --> 01:43:59,553
是海潮把我们带过来的
That high tide carried us over!

1275
01:44:00,326 --> 01:44:02,287
看到了吗
You see that?

1276
01:44:23,717 --> 01:44:26,927
Fitz 打开探照灯
Fitz, turn on the searchlight.

1277
01:44:57,675 --> 01:45:01,792
- 看 看到了吗 - 是我们的人吗
- Look, you see that? - Is that our boys!

1278
01:45:13,406 --> 01:45:14,952
是他们吗
Is it them?

1279
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:19,458
干得漂亮 Bernie
Well done, Bernie!

1280
01:45:19,483 --> 01:45:23,517
- 你做到了 Webber - 干得好 Webber
- You did it, Webber! - Well done, Webber!

1281
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:27,058
36-500号正在靠近查塔姆码头
36-500 is now docking at the Chatham pier.

1282
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:30,036
看来有三十二名幸存者 长官 再说一遍
There appear to be 32 survivors, Sir. Repeat,

1283
01:45:30,061 --> 01:45:32,437
共三十二人获救
we have 32 survivors.

1284
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,233
很好
That's right.

1285
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,793
扔过来 孩子
Throw it, son.

1286
01:45:53,228 --> 01:45:55,470
好小子 Bernie
Atta boy! Bernie.

1287
01:46:05,704 --> 01:46:07,102
拉他们一把
Give 'em a hand.

1288
01:46:07,417 --> 01:46:09,352
- 见到你们真好 - 快上来
- Good to see you. - Get on up here.

1289
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,800
慢慢来
Nice and easy.

1290
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,996
还以为再也见不到你们了
We never thought we'd see you again.

1291
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,423
这位要冻僵了 给我件大衣
This man's freezing, get me a coat.

1292
01:46:14,581 --> 01:46:16,792
快进去 里面暖和
Go on in, it's warm inside.

我们回家吧
Let's go home.

1300
01:48:41,367 --> 01:48:43,452
我们还是四月十六日结婚吗

- 是的 - 是的

我替你请示过Cluff了
