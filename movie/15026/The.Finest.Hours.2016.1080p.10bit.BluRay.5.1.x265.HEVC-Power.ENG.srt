00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:02,192
Bernie, seriously!
Is this where they asked us to meet?

10
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:04,949
Yeah, what do you mean?
Oh! I think I see her.

11
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,250
Where?
Oh! Its gotta be her!

12
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,359
Gus, what are we gonna do?

13
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,873
Aren't we gonna grab a milkshake?
Isn't that really why we here?

14
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,247
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yes.

15
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,161
Alright! Nite's gonna be big for us.

16
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,161
So?

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,964
You think I should've worn the other shirt?
You look nice.

18
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:48,161
I do not know, Gus, maybe, what if she
doesn't wanna look at me or somethin'?

19
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:52,879
Bernie, come on. Are you sure, you serious?
What about her?

20
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,629
Aren't you dyin' to see what she looks like?

21
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:58,324
She could be a dog.
No, she ain't a dog.

22
00:01:58,483 --> 00:01:59,595
It coule be.

23
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:02,228
I know what she looks like.
She's ain't a dog.

24
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:07,762
So, you been talking to her for weeks on the phone, right?

25
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,507
Yeah.
Right?

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,688
Yeah.

27
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:18,410
She likes ya, she's been talkin' to you, Bernie.

28
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,177
And I don't you gotta worry about her gettin' go look at ya.
That ain't never been your problem.

29
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:27,227
Let's go.

30
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,252
Come on.

31
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,157
Should have worn the other shirt.

32
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,246
I'm the one taking the risk,

33
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:50,738
doubling with some girl,
I saw never spoke to, let alone seen!

34
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:54,073
I'm the one who ain't sure why
Miriam would double date anyway!

35
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:56,739
Maybe she's not sure about me yet.

36
00:02:56,965 --> 00:03:01,191
How could anybody not be sure about you, Bernie?
Yeah. Thanks, Gus.

37
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh! Yeah, don't go telling anything
to the guys at the station about this.

38
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,890
It's not like you've never been on a date before.

39
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,447
All set there?

40
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:13,938
Ahh...excuse me?

41
00:03:14,722 --> 00:03:16,104
Are you Miriam?

42
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,908
No. I'm her friend.

43
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:22,834
She's...

44
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:32,293
Hi. How you doin'? I'm Gus.
Catherine.

45
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,316
Well, we'll talk later.

46
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,144
Bye.

47
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,941
Hi.

48
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:05,687
Wait!

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,140
You're Bernie Webber, right?

50
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,711
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Bernie.

51
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,502
Hey, you two! Let's go grab a drink.

52
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:21,313
You wanna go?
Sure.

53
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,916
Hey, how you doin'?

54
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,297
I'm Gus.
I, eh...

55
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:30,172
for a minute there I thought it was a
smoking barmaid calling from that booth.

56
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,999
'Cause it's on your jacket.
Oh!

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,087
Bernie?

58
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:52,997
Miriam's never been on a boat.
She's scared of the water.

59
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,006
Is she never?

60
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,015
I told her, I dunno how she's gonna
date a guy in the coast guard.

61
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,069
I'm not scared.
I live on the Cape.

62
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:02,853
Don't worry, Mariam.
You know...we all get scared out there.

63
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,648
I'm not afraid of the water, Bernie.

64
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:08,076
Scares me at night, that's all, you know.

65
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:10,651
You can't see what's underneath.

66
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:14,267
Just more water.

67
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:26,729
You know, I get funnier as the night goes on.

68
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:29,723
Why...why didn't you wanna meet other day with...

69
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,501
Why...why did you wait so long?

70
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:35,696
I didn't know if you'd be a...

71
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:38,737
If I what?

72
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,337
You know?
No.

73
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,940
You are so handsome.
I didn't know you'd be attracted to me.

74
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:52,696
Oh God! No, Mariam!
You're exactly how I pictured you.

75
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:55,506
Yeah?
Oh! Yeah.

76
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,623
Better!

77
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,506
You know, my brother he always says,
when you know, you just know.

78
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,231
Which one?
All of it, I guess you know everything.

79
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,867
No, I mean which brother.

80
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,987
Oh! I...

81
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,438
Ah...Paul. My brother Paul.

82
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,166
He's the one who fought over in Germany, right?
In Germany, yeah.

83
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,477
He is the oldest.
Father's favorite, and...

84
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,708
All three of my brothers fought in the war.
He is your father's what?

85
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:34,987
We should get Miriam on a boat tonight.
What do you say, buddy?

86
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:38,672
We take up the Dory.
It will be fantastic.

87
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:41,899
You know we can't do that, Gus.
We could get into trouble.

88
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,180
Come on, Bernie!
It will be fun.

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,680
Rules are rules.

90
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:47,142
No. We don't have to go out far!

83 00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:49,278
Just to say a sweet girl was on a boat.

91
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,745
A row boat?
No.

92
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,913
No, no. We're are not...
Small boat sails...

93
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:05,241
How about one of those bigger boats?
Hide out the dock?

94
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,474
If Bernie is with me, we can do it.
An old fishing boat?

95
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:12,608
Thoso fishermen don't want us around.
Unless we're pullin' them in.

96
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,877
They think they own the Goddamn water.
They are not really very nice.

97
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,994
Come on! Don't be such a fathead, Mariam.
Yeah!

98
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:23,759
Let's go out on the Dory.
What's there to be afraid of?

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,838
What's underneath, right?
Hmm...uh.

100
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,254
Hey Mr.Stello, How's it goin'?

101
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,557
Hey, Bernie.
Mr.Ryder.

102
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:50,041
Umm, you see...see that cute
girl sittin' over there?

103
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,864
One with the coat?
Looks like a bear bunny.

104
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,562
Yeah.
Can't miss her.

105
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:58,421
Said the same thing myself!
Funny you should say that, yeah.

106
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:00,902
Looks like Smokey, right?
Yeah, Smokey the Bear.

107
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,875
I don't know no Smokey, Bearnie.

108
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,664
Oh! It's just a cartoon.

109
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:09,234
Anyway! Mr.Stello, she thinks
she's scared to go on a boat.

110
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:14,531
And I don't think we should take a Dory.
And I don't want her to get sick on that nice big coat.

111
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:15,798
So I was wondering if...

112
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,369
So, you wanna take her to Anna G around the harbor?

113
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:19,885
Yeah.

114
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:23,245
Can't roll on that Dory, even if you wanna.
Right Bernie?

115
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:24,529
Carl! Stop.

116
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:28,442
Here I'm workin', my birthday's comin'.
My sister is now living in my house.

117
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,256
How's it goin' with you, Bernie?

118
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:35,670
That's enough, Carl.
He did all he could.

119
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,324
I am sorry, Mr.Nickerson.

120
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:43,930
Didn't mean to upset you.
Just wanted to ask Mr.Stello about borrowin' a boat.

121
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,908
Got ya. Got you.

122
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:56,281
Give me your hands.

123
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,335
Its ok.

It's cold. You feel that?
There's a storm coming.

155
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:12,952
Ok?

156
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:19,515
OK? What?
OK? Let's get married. I just don't wanna...

157
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:20,618
Don't wanna what?

158
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:27,012
It's only been a few months
and it's still winter afterall.

159
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:31,176
And, look...you know, there's a storm coming.
It's just like this one come through last year.

160
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:32,388
What does that...

161
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:35,818
I heard it's gonna miss us.

162
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, maybe not.
You never know.

163
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:40,688
You never know.

164
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,786
Some people are just not cut out for this.

165
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,151
Sometimes you go out and you don't come back.

166
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:51,511
Are you talking about the storm or marriage, Bernie?

167
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,296
I think I'm talking about the storm, right?

168
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,619
You are scared of a storm?

169
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,103
No.

170
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,603
I don't wanna disappoint anybody.

171
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,158
And...

172
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:13,114
I do not wanna lose you.
I love you.

173
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,641
So...

174
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,020
yeah, let's get married.

175
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,857
You sure?

176
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:28,806
Oh! Yeah.

177
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:32,958
When?

178
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,791
What? You want me to pick a date? No.
When do you wanna get married?

179
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:39,376
April 16th.
OK?

180
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:42,629
Ok! April 16th it is.

181
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:47,609
But...but I gotta ask permission from Cluff first .
You gotta ask permission?

182
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:50,816
Yeah, it's...it's from my commanding Officer.
It's Coast Guard regulation.

183
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,053
But promise, I will ask him tomorrow.

184
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:56,053
Ok, Bernie.

185
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,054
Let's get you home.

186
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,690
Maybe we can dance.

187
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:14,576
Ah! Look at that!
It's already started to snow. Hmm?

188
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,499
Can you hear me over this humming, Captain?

189
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:59,505
Now that fracture they welded last month,
that's not gonna hold in this seas.

190
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:02,020
Takes about a jolt to fracture again.

191
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:07,428
I don't have to go on tech, Captain.
I can hear it right down from here.

192
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,626
That weld is really hummin'.

193
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:16,271
It's hummin', sir...the weld is...hummin'.
I like to take it down to three knots, please.

194
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:24,050
If we do not slow down, Captain,
we may not have the...

195
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,114
position to hold.

196
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:31,821
Ah! No problem, Cap.

197
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,436
Holdin' at seven knots.
Thank you, sir.

198
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:47,774
Hey, Pop?
I hear it, right.

199
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:53,175
You wanna go up on deck and look at those
crack rusters holdin' up those welds together?

200
00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:56,068
You might as well go get a hat, Popo.

201
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,752
What did he say?

202
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,305
He says he would like you to consider
takin' in a hat with you as well.

203
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:18,081
Get some sleep.

204
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:21,058
No! We rockin' the boat!

205
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,058
Hey, Pops?

206
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:26,310
We know about this weather!
It's killing me and young Eldon here.

207
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:29,599
Tiny, sure it's the weather?
Maybe it's your singin'.

208
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:34,804
* Boy! People said sit down *
* Sit down, you are rockin' the boat *

209
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:35,806
Come on.

210
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:39,472
* People said sit down *
* Sit down, you are rockin' the boat *

211
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,408
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

212
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:52,591
Ah! It's gonna get worse.

213
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,033
Jimmy? I didn't make it top side.
That weld can't hold in these seas.

214
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:10,838
You gotta slow her down.

215
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:14,282
I'm callin' the captain back.

216
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,157
It's comin' in.

217
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,417
Ok pops?
Yeah.

218
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,605
Go up!

219
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:13,669
We gotta hull fracture in the engine room.

220
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:19,023
All hands muster your mattresses, blankets!
Whatever you can get your hands on.

221
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,520
Tudor?

222
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,027
Yeah, boy?

223
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:34,698
I can't get anyone on the bridge.

224
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,248
I need you to go up tell the captain that
there is a 18 foot fracture in our hull.

225
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:41,580
Tell him these pumps can hold,
but put 'em in port before they wreck.

226
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,366
Captain don't understand me, Will.

227
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:47,318
I know he doesn't understand ya,
he doesn't listen to anyone, anyway.

228
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:31,318
Jesus! Mary and Joseph!

229
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,839
Cold out there?
Yeah.

230
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:25,677
Still trying to fix that daft thing?
Yeah.

231
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,526
Oh! Come on, Fritzy!
It's useless.

232
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,719
Let the guy who fixed it, come fix it.

233
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:31,767
I would if he would show up.

234
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:33,972
What's this on the radio, ship breakin' up?

235
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,779
That's the Fort Mercer.

236
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:39,695
Fort...Fort Mercer?
She's a big lady, she's a T2 tanker.

237
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,573
It was out on radio, coupla hours ago.
Apparently she's got a big crack in her hull.

238
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,074
It's pillin' oil all over the place.

239
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,952
She is about 20 miles east off of Nantucket.

240
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:53,636
It sounds like Boston and Nantucket send over their entire fleet.
We could be next.

241
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:58,128
They're saying gail force winds 50 or 60 mph!

242
00:20:58,228 --> 00:21:00,128
Yeah?
Yeah.

243
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:03,212
It's gonna be a mess.

244
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,643
Oh! Bernie, Bernie? Umm...
Miriam called for ya.

245
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,659
Yeah.
Ok.

246
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,479
Good luck, pal.

247
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,339
Yeah?
Mr.Cluff.

248
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:26,075
It's me...Bernie, sir.

249
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:32,863
Webber, pick yourself a crew.
Go out there, help them fishermen secure their boat at the pier.

250
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:34,853
Yeah, sir.

251
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:38,005
Sir, I need...need to ask you a question.

252
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,425
Need a permission about...about a girl.

253
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:45,078
Permission?
Permission...for a girl?

254
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,764
Mr.Cluff, sir it's working now.

255
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:49,074
Yeah, sir.
Not now, Webber!

256
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:54,784
But, you know sir. It is not some girl, sir.
Not now, Webber.

257
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,791
We're back up.

258
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,552
Cluster here Mercer rescue right?

259
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:03,323
And this here another blip, 2 miles from here?

260
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,639
We must still be gettin' phantom echoes!

261
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:08,154
How we supposed to tell, one of them is out there?

262
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:12,295
When's that technician comin' fixin' this, Patrick?
And where's Chief Bangs?

263
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,588
Alright! It's Fitzgerald, sir.

264
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:17,649
Chief Bangs is in the mess hall, sir.

265
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,095
You meant to follow my accent
cause I'm not from around here.

266
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:25,464
No, Mr.Cluff.

267
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:31,396
Why are still standin', Webber?
Sir, but...

268
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:33,981
Take Livesey with you,
and top them fishing boats.

269
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,392
Yeah, sir.
You want me to go with Webber, sir?

270
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,843
To secure fishing boats?

271
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:44,655
You didn't hear me, Livesey?
Yeah, you with Webber.

272
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:54,183
Sorry, Reg! His orders, you know.

273
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,866
That's enough time, what do you think, huh?

274
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:18,164
We're takin' up water,
we gotta launch some lifeboats.

275
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,965
Why you gotta be such a jackass, Broom?

276
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:23,101
The least we can do is pray
for the Captain, Chief Collagen...

277
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,245
rest of them men.
All good men.

278
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,232
Eh? We good men, Cory?

279
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:28,679
Ah! Don't get me wrong,

280
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,514
prayin' is great, but it aint everything.

281
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,088
We actually need to do something.

282
00:23:42,082 --> 00:23:44,308
Sybert? A word.

283
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,550
That hothead Brown, he wants to launch the lifeboats.

284
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,940
Lifeboats?
Quirey, he wants to do nothing.

285
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:53,460
The between of them, the two of them
are gettin' worked up.

286
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:04,105
Now, I figure that you know the boat better than anybody.
You are practically married to it, so...

287
00:24:04,107 --> 00:24:08,186
I think they'll listen to ya.
Listen to me?

288
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:10,906
Half those men don't like me.

289
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:13,299
Nobody on this ship likes me,
but you and Tchuda.

290
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,953
They might not like ya,
but they outta listen to ya.

291
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:46,278
We do not know if the Captain got off an SOS.

292
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:49,112
The radio is gone.
We can't call nobody.

293
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,922
It's just...just Garcia over here with
a shortwave tryin' to pickup chatter!

294
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,538
I mean, far as we know,
nobody even knows we're out here.

295
00:24:57,026 --> 00:25:00,595
I'm sayin', we launch some lifeboats
and get off the ship while we can.

296
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,724
How we gonna get them in
the water in this storm?

297
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:06,876
It can't be done! Those boats are too small.
It's suicide, Brady!

298
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:10,788
You can not do this, you can't do that?
You just wanna sit up here, do nothin'?

299
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,377
That's it! No officers, no orders.
Every man for himself.

300
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,816
That ain't the way, Brown.

301
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:18,533
Never did nothin' for nobody.

302
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:21,119
Now, ship's split...

303
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:23,666
but the bulkhead's seperating the tanks, 8 and 9.

304
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:26,608
And Mr.Sybert says that the other
tanks are not fractured, so...

305
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,197
the air in the ballast tanks
should keep us afloat.

306
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:34,041
But Mr.Sybert also says that...
Mr.Sybert says this, Mr.Sybert says that.

307
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:36,710
He's a big boy. Let him say it himself.
He is righthere.

308
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,576
Go ahead.

309
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:48,013
Ah..ah, we're sinking.

310
00:25:50,486 --> 00:25:52,294
Yeah, but the whistle works.

311
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,852
So we should keep blowin' that.
Maybe somebody will hear it.

312
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,666
I do not know, but we're definitely sinking.

313
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:04,922
Because the crack in the engine room
is takin' on too much water.

314
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,462
Pumps can't keep up.

315
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:13,383
If the water reaches the air intake in the engine,
we gonna eh, lose all the power.

316
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:16,228
If we lose all the power, we lose the pumps.
We lose the pumps...

317
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:19,355
then we gonna drop really quick.

318
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,813
How long we got before that happens?

319
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:26,200
Four, maybe five hours.

320
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:30,062
We need to buy ourselves some time.

321
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:33,071
So somebody can find us.

322
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,614
If anybody is even lookin'.

323
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:38,359
Even if they do know we're here,
the sea is big enough.

324
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,933
I mean, it ripped this thing in half.

325
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,040
How will they hell are we gonna get out?

326
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:45,793
That's why I'm sayin' we gotta launch the lifeboats.

327
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:48,879
Our lucks runnin' out.
I don't believe in luck, Broom.

328
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:53,453
Put those lifeboats out there in the seas,
won't last 12 seconds.

329
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:56,128
You and Quirey...both just wanna sit around do nothin.

330
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,979
You got a better idea, Sybert,
or you just gonna hide down below?

331
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:09,386
We'll run her ground.

332
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:11,300
What? Do what?

333
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:13,550
You wanna run her ground, Sybert?

334
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:16,284
Even if it could with half a ship, why would ya?

335
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:19,404
This will break apart and
dump us all out in the sea.

336
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:22,879
It's our only choice.
We find a soft shore and lay her up.

337
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,554
Slow the water that's comin' in,

338
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:26,709
stay in the same spot and blow the whistle,

339
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,173
will give us a chance for someone
trying to to look for us to find us.

340
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:31,509
You gonna stay on the ship without hydraulics?

341
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,189
That's your plan?
How's that gonna work?

342
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,806
We'll build a manual tiller.

343
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,850
Hey Sybert, why...why should we even listen to you?

344
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:40,812
All you ever cared about, was this ship.

345
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:43,345
Tell you what?
You two make a cute couple at the bottom of the ocean.

346
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,445
Me? I wanna go in a lifeboat.

347
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:47,171
Look.

348
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:52,672
Insert a steel beam into this steering quadrant.

349
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,726
We put pulleys on the end of it for leverage.

350
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:00,865
And we will move it manually.

351
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,978
Excuse me?
Excuse me?

352
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:10,565
I think I got the radio working.

353
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:19,644
Bearing 83 degrees, 27 miles east of Nantucket...

354
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:22,464
East of Nantucket?
That ain't the Pendleton.

355
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:25,649
Fort Mercer...that's another T2.

356
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,971
Another tanker split in two, besides us!

357
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,875
But if everyones gonna help them, who's gonna...?

358
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:34,074
Who's gonna come for us?

359
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,519
How you feelin'?
Everythin' alright?

360
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:45,274
Did you...did you ask Cluff yet?
No.

361
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:46,491
Why didn't you ask 'em?

362
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,320
What's wrong with you?
Bella?

363
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:52,188
What?
You ask him yet? You ask Cluff?

364
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,089
I told you not to tell anybody.

365
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:59,096
I'm sorry! I'm not having a very good day.
I know you're not feeling well...

366
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:01,516
You know, Willey, you don't need
permission to get married.

367
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,629
Actually, you do Chief.
Unless you are under-age.

368
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:07,979
Well...thank you, chief.
Just following regulations.

369
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:09,862
Let's go get suited up.

370
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:14,372
Well it's not regulation, Webber.
Just, eh...a formality, curtosy.

371
00:29:14,444 --> 00:29:18,151
And, hey! Did I hear right that she asked you?

372
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:20,049
Following orders, right bubba?

373
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,361
Yeah, she asked me, Chief.

374
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:29,053
Wow! Wow! You sure got your pants
on Webber or she wearin' em?

375
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:30,858
Sounds like this girl
cut off you ba...

376
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,378
What, Webber? What, huh?
Woo!

377
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,593
Don't you got boats to tie up?

378
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:41,172
She's...she's my fiancee, sir.

379
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:43,680
Who asked you...

380
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:46,589
to be married?

381
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,020
Come on, Livesey, let's go.

382
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,100
One moment.

383
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:53,995
Sure.

384
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:56,290
I'm sorry, sir.
Say it.

385
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,936
This line is bad, ma'am.
I try to connect again.

386
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,131
Please, sir.
The lines down.

387
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:03,588
Bernie? How are you?
How's work?

388
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,634
You know, it's been one of those days.
But how are you?

389
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:09,845
Hey! You're not the radar technician are ya?
No.

390
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:12,515
I was ordered to hole up
here till the storm passes.

391
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:14,549
Can't get my eye to my lightship.

392
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,489
You can wait in the mess hall if you want to.

393
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,883
Now is not a good time, uh...you know.

394
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:23,902
I gotta get ready go down to the
pier and to tie some boats.

395
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,200
I wish you were with me.

396
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:28,548
I hear about sorts of things about
a ship breaking up and I...

397
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:28,961
Oh!

398
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,466
What, are you okay?

399
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:33,437
Yeah, we just lost the light.

400
00:30:34,321 --> 00:30:36,115
You better go find 'em then.

401
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:39,421
Nantucket has dispatched their
36 footer to the Marie...

402
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:42,339
You asked Cluff yet?
That him, right?

403
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,452
No...not yet, sweetheart.

404
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,095
I'll explain later, I gotta go.
Good.

405
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,391
I love you.
I love you too.

406
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:51,783
Bye.

407
00:30:57,244 --> 00:31:00,530
The best thing is that she
had no idea who I was.

408
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,488
Bangs?

409
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:05,519
Pick yourself a crew.
Take the 36500 to the Old Harbor.

410
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:09,370
Proceed to Fort Mercer,
20 miles east off Nantucket, you hear?

411
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:13,288
Ah! I don't...don't believe we would get
over the bar with this weater, Mr.Cluff.

412
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,421
We are better off taking the
36383 off the Stage Harbor.

413
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:18,690
About take long right?

414
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:20,605
Not much.

415
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,875
What do you think, Webber?
Oh?

416
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,649
You're boats-mate.
You know how it is out there.

417
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:31,351
Now look, nobodys goin' over the bar
in this weather, Mr.Cluff. Nobody.

418
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:32,809
It's a suicide mission.

419
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:35,848
We should take out the
36383 outta Stage Harbor.

420
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,926
Takes a little...sure.
But atleast you'll be able to get out.

421
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,608
Godspeed, Chief.

422
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:54,079
Let Gouthro Livesey down the fishing pier.
Yes, sir.

423
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:11,521
Don't get me sick, Gus.
You should't even be out here.

424
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:13,890
Why you always dragging us, Richie?

425
00:33:13,914 --> 00:33:16,168
Don't take it out on us just 'cause
you ain't rollin' with Bangs.

426
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:19,115
Atleast we'll get out!
We won't, screw you! That was a year ago!

427
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:20,324
Screw you!?

428
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:23,621
No one could have got over the bar that day.
Bangs did it.

429
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,917
Oh! Really, Richie?
He's not trying to get across the bar today!

430
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:31,131
No, he says take the 36383 right off
from the nice protected bay site.

431
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:32,331
Ah!

432
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:39,350
Bernie, it doesn't matter what Richie thinks...

433
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,481
Bangs or whoever thinks. Nobody.

434
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,278
No one could have saved those men at the Langery.

435
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:52,535
Sometimes you know...men die, Bernie.

436
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:27,290
Alright, here we go.

437
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,550
Alright, hang on.
Now, easy fellas.

438
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,101
Got it.
Ok, now up, up, up, up.

439
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,603
One, two...all together now.

440
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:47,359
Three.

441
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,923
Nicely done boys!
Now tie it.

442
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:57,205
Alright! Now we got a tiller.
Now we gonna drive her in a shore.

443
00:34:57,373 --> 00:35:01,065
Ah! Ah! Brown and them others are getting
ready to rise some lifeboats.

444
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,845
They think it's their best hope.

445
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:04,845
Oh, Pop!

446
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:10,265
We need every guy we got!
Well...they're gonna grab those lifeboats.

447
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,894
What are you trying to do, Sybert?
Get off of him.

448
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:49,110
You trying to kill us?
You trying to kill us?

449
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:51,863
Take it easy.
Stand up.

450
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,034
You're outta your mind!
He just saved your life.

451
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:58,831
The boat is in pieces.
It's gone, enough!

452
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:05,757
That boat is too small for this seas.

453
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:10,430
And this boat will be sunk by night fall.

454
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:11,932
Every fellar who wants to live...

455
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:16,146
and the only way that happens
is if we run her run aground.

456
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,363
We setup a watch and look out for a shore.

457
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,325
I need four men working the pulleys
on the emergency tiller.

458
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:28,288
I need four men manning the pump,
aft the steerin'...

459
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:31,292
and the rest of you bucket top side below...

460
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,503
and communicates with the engine room.

461
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:40,054
And somebody...keep blowing that whistle.

462
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,974
You heard him, boys.
Now move it! Come on!

463
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,108
Sounds like you're the man now, Sybert.

464
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:55,533
Hope you just didn't kill us all.

465
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:16,979
I saw a ship driftin'.
Heard it whistle.

466
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:20,108
A distress signal.
45 minutes ago, Bernie.

467
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,276
From my house!

468
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:27,075
Ah! The wind's blowin' south,
and those currents, I...

469
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:31,631
I guess that'll put up here
about comin' near over the bar.

470
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:34,002
Can't be part of the Mercer, Bernie.

471
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,795
She's off Nantucket, 40 miles...

472
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,358
means she would've drifted northwest, right?

473
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:43,055
I know what I heard.
Know what I saw.

474
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:48,605
OK, then...eh.

475
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:53,569
How about we go back to the station
and get to the bottom of it?

476
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,490
Just got off the phone with Boston.

477
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,535
They diverted a plane to Mercer...

478
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:02,666
this side of the stern of the tank from Hamilton
5 miles of Pendleton east of here.

479
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:07,923
My God! Two tankers broken in half?
In one day? It's gotta be some kinda record.

480
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:11,803
Boston and Nantucket have dispatched
all boats to the Mercer.

481
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:14,097
They can't make it in this weather.

482
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:44,222
Webber, pick yourself a crew.
Take that 36500 and go over the bar...

483
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,309
and find the stern of the Pendleton.
You hear?

484
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:51,857
Yes, sir.

485
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:06,585
You fellas wanna get warmed up?
Get some coffee.

486
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:09,585
Bernie?

487
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:12,761
What?

483
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:16,140
What Carl is trying to say...

488
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:19,936
This isn't about the Landry.
Oh! Sure it is.

489
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:23,065
Ritchie, eight men died that night.

490
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:29,324
You, Gus and Masachi couldn't even get out.
What makes you think you can do it now?

491
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,522
You know the bar on this county, Bernie?
Yeah.

492
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,103
The man doesn't know what he's doin'.
He's sendin' you out to die.

493
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:42,384
You can't make it over Chatham bar
on a day like this.

494
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:45,471
You can't stay afloat long
enough for half ship, neither.

495
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:53,816
You know, Mr.Stello, the coast guard,
they say, 'You gotta go out'.

496
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:55,835
But they don't say, 'You gotta come back in'.

497
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:58,322
That's regulation, you know.

498
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:01,577
Bernie, before you get too far out there.

499
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:03,788
Don't worry about me, Mr.Ryder.

500
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,834
I can't get lost out there.
I know these waters pretty good.

501
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,169
How can I get lost?

502
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:11,256
No, no, no Bernie.
What Dave's tryin' to say...

503
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:15,011
is that you should motor around the harbor,
say you tried to get out, but couldn't...you know?

504
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,732
Thank you, Mr.Ryder.
Thank you.

505
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,737
But Mr.Stello, I'm gonna do
the best to get out there.

506
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:30,324
I don't know if if I don't,
but I'm gonna try.

507
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:02,893
Ok.

508
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,039
I guess Richie's in?
Who else?

509
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:11,212
I don't know, Gus.
You barely can lift your head.

510
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:14,884
Who else you gonna take, Bernie?
Fitz is the only other engine-man left.

511
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:18,764
And he is only third class,
and he ain't got the experience.

512
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:24,564
I'm can go.
Yeah, I can...I can do the job.

513
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,276
I mean, I can do it.
You can't go.

514
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:32,908
You're as sick as a dog, Gus.
He's right, Gus.

515
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:37,998
One more?

516
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:46,061
Someone has to go out,
save those guys, right?

517
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:50,766
That's why I signed up.
Think now is my chance.

518
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:55,689
Sailor Ervin Maske, Stonehorse lightship.

519
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,352
Pumps aren't keepin' up.

520
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:19,845
Three more feet...before we lose the engines.

521
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:21,889
You locked those boiler rooms, Full?

522
00:43:21,956 --> 00:43:26,162
You're crazy to think you can control
with a few ropes and a tiller, bud.

523
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,441
You got a better idea?
I'm all ears.

524
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:34,907
There!
A shore about a mile distance.

525
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,285
We can make that!

526
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:41,290
Rudder, 15 degrees to port.
Half speed if we wanna hit it head-on.

527
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:44,504
Gotta make a 80 degrees turn
on the compass to 3,10,

528
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:53,766
Rudder, 15 degrees to port. Half speed.
80 degrees at 3:10 on compass.

529
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:57,437
15 degrees to port. Half speed.
80 degrees at 3:10 on compass.

530
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:01,317
Rudder, 15 degrees to port. Half speed.
80 degrees at 3:10 on compass.

531
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:29,856
Rudder, 15 degrees to port. Half speed.
80 degrees at 3:10 on compass.

532
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:31,608
Thank you, Eldon.

533
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:48,506
Ok, guys? Now pull, pull, pull. Come on!

534
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:18,381
Please tell me that we are taking
that boat to a bigger boat.

535
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:20,967
Have you ever been on a rescue mission before?
No.

536
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:25,682
Usually chip paint.
Sometimes I cook for the boys.

537
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:27,768
Great!

538
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:36,847
Alright, you take the glory hole.
Masky. Ervin, Masky.

539
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:38,347
Ervin, yeah.

540
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:40,101
Richie, drop the mooring line when you can.

541
00:45:45,824 --> 00:45:47,985
The last known position of the Pendleton is here.

542
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:51,781
So I fugure, once we cross the bar,
I reckon the currents...

543
00:45:52,323 --> 00:45:55,118
drifted about here.
That's 6 miles from us.

544
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:06,840
So you think that Bernie can
get us out past bar on this?

545
00:46:07,007 --> 00:46:09,218
I never seen anything like it.

546
00:46:09,385 --> 00:46:13,305
Yeah, I mean it's gotta be failure.
Hope he doesn't pitch-bowl, that's all.

547
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,020
The power on the waves in that bar,
can pick you up...

548
00:46:18,186 --> 00:46:21,231
and they can tag you in
for over and over again.

549
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:24,318
There is no way to survive that.
That's a pitch-bowl.

550
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:45,050
Hey Fitz, we good?
Give it a shot.

551
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,979
Reel the lines.
Lines reeled.

552
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:39,696
Did Bernie go out, Gus?
Miriam, what are you doing in here?

553
00:47:40,947 --> 00:47:44,576
Did he?
Yeah, Cluff did.

554
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,830
I want to talk to him.

555
00:47:48,414 --> 00:47:50,290
Who?
Cluff.

556
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:52,127
Your commanding officer.
Where is he?

557
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:56,006
I want to find out where Bernie is.
I'm worried about him.

558
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,382
We are suposed to get married.

559
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:02,472
Miriam, this isn't what the other girls do.
Or wives!

560
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:05,933
They don't come in here,
and they don't do this.

561
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,813
So?

562
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:20,825
If you want, you can wait in here.
Listen to what is going on.

563
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:24,998
Sit down.

564
00:49:10,758 --> 00:49:14,136
Tides risin'.
Could've drove across the shore.

565
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:17,181
We need to hit it hard.
Yeah, there is no other way.

566
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:19,017
Wave!

567
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:44,587
You feel that? We're drifting.
Must've lost the tiller.

568
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:48,885
We're gonna slow dead-weight or
we gonna miss the shore...do it.

569
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:54,474
Cut the governor valve, stop the propulsion.
Isolate the boiler.

570
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:57,019
We're gotta conserve everything she got left .

571
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:01,149
I continue to tell you, Bouloo.
This boat just bad luck.

572
00:50:01,357 --> 00:50:05,445
It has nothing to do with luck.

573
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:42,404
Station Chatham, this is the CG-36500,
Do you copy?

574
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:46,447
This is Station Chatham.
36500, where's your location, over?

575
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:50,538
Station Chatham, we are now passing Morris Island.

576
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,668
Down the shell towards the Chatham bar.
Over.

577
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:58,297
What does it mean going over the bar?
Miriam, don't do this to yourself.

578
00:50:58,464 --> 00:50:59,798
Why not?

579
00:51:01,007 --> 00:51:02,343
Why not, Gus?

580
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,513
When I'm gonna be with him, I wanna know.

581
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:15,358
You're the girl with the bear-coat, right?
Yeah..that's me!

582
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,240
You gonna tell me,
what's it's like up there?

583
00:51:24,285 --> 00:51:27,748
Sholes on that bar are never the same place, twice.

584
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:31,459
Flood currents carrin' them...

585
00:51:31,627 --> 00:51:34,963
big ocean sweels and rise up and
they shell crash up against that bar.

586
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:38,425
Out tide go crashing against the bar.

587
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:45,058
That man shouldn't have sent those
men in a storm like this..

588
00:51:46,726 --> 00:51:51,691
Maybe they can turn back.
Maybe they get lost before.

589
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,151
Can't get out.

590
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:02,453
You know Bernie, right?
You know he won't get lost out there.

591
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:08,752
You know he follows the rules.
Yeah, we know.

592
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:14,926
We all going down to the pier too.
See if we can do anything down there.

593
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:19,847
Welcome to come.

594
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:33,363
Miriam...Mariam, please come here.

595
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:34,863
Mariam?

596
00:52:37,743 --> 00:52:40,831
Excuse me, are you Commander Cluff?
Who are you?

597
00:52:40,897 --> 00:52:44,310
I'm Miriam Pentinen, Bernie Webber's girlfriend.
I want you to call Bernie, back in.

598
00:52:44,376 --> 00:52:46,878
The girl he asked me.
Do you know what he wanted to ask?

599
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,635
For your permission to marry me.
That's between you, him and your God.

600
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,771
Asking me is just a formality.
He can marry all he wants.

601
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:59,643
Don't you know that?
But you can't be in here, Miss.

602
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:00,810
It is Bernie.

603
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:04,357
Chatham bar straight ahead, over.
36500, Station Chatham.

604
00:53:04,523 --> 00:53:07,277
Proceed as directed, towards Pendleton stern.

605
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:11,657
I didn't copy that, Station Chatham.
The conditions are extreme.

606
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:14,953
Why give him permission if
you're sending him out to die?

607
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,000
What the hell!
Gouthro, get her out of here!

608
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:25,046
Sir, wind has gone off from 40 to 60,
since they first got off in.

609
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:28,718
That will be hurricane strength in an hour.
Gouthro, he got his orders.

610
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:33,014
You get her outta here, and you get to bed.
You're too sick to be in here.

611
00:53:42,484 --> 00:53:45,821
36500, Station Chatham,
proceed over the bar.

612
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:48,157
I repeat, proceed.

613
00:53:48,299 --> 00:53:50,753
Once over it, travel south....

614
00:53:50,773 --> 00:53:52,954
radar's emitting.
Showin' a pep.

615
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:58,335
About 10 miles East of Monomoy Point over south.
Over.

616
00:53:59,628 --> 00:54:04,842
Station Chatham, this is the 500, copy that.

617
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:22,236
I hear what everyones saying.
You don't know what you're doing.

618
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:28,661
Excuse me?
Maybe because you're not from here.

619
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:30,828
You do not know how it's there.

620
00:54:30,928 --> 00:54:33,916
What the hell would you know,
how it's like there, Miss? Hmm?

621
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:36,753
Please just call them back.

622
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,132
What do you think it's gonna be like,
married to a Coast guard, Mariam?

623
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:41,759
Please, call just them back.

624
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:44,887
You gonna come in here, scared,
everytime he's in the water?

625
00:54:45,054 --> 00:54:48,225
Please call them back.
You, don't belong here.

626
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:53,815
Please call them back.
Get out of here! Get outta my station.

627
00:54:53,982 --> 00:54:57,525
And go home to where you belong, Miss.
Please call them back.

628
00:54:57,652 --> 00:54:59,779
Get out my station!

629
00:56:00,766 --> 00:56:02,560
Shore's gettin' behind us.

630
00:56:04,395 --> 00:56:07,399
Only chance now is a hard turn,
if the chains hold...but,

631
00:56:08,357 --> 00:56:09,794
it could capsize us.

632
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:29,924
That's good work.

633
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:46,985
You need to stand clear, boys.

634
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:51,323
Those shackles crack, these chains snap
and rip right through ya.

635
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,326
Here we go.

636
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,756
Gotta her movin'.

637
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:20,607
You hear that?
That's it! That's the bar.

638
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,907
Coupla minutes now, boys.

639
00:57:35,248 --> 00:57:39,378
* When I was a little boy *

640
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:45,468
* hold my mother, told me *

641
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:48,889
* Way-o-way *

642
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,563
* We on our way, Joe *

643
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:59,401
* I first met a Yankee girl *

644
00:57:59,902 --> 00:58:03,572
* she was fat and lazy tummy! *

645
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:10,413
* Way ho way ho *
* Way ho way ho...Joe *

646
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:17,589
* Then I met an Irish girl *
* who dam me, made me crazy...tummy *

647
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:25,430
* Way ho way ho *
* Way ho way ho...Joe *

648
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:31,980
* Now way ho way ho *
* We are bound for better weather, tummy *

649
00:58:33,147 --> 00:58:40,280
* Way ho way ho *
* We are all way, Joe *

650
00:59:01,555 --> 00:59:06,310
Hey boys! We won't be able to see much, alright?

651
00:59:06,477 --> 00:59:11,525
So we gotta listen to those waves hittin' that bar.
Gotta time it.

652
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:17,448
So I'm gonna wait for a low, and then we go.
We got faith in you, Skip.

653
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:21,244
Anytime you're ready, you just go, Bernie.
Alright?

654
01:00:54,725 --> 01:00:56,436
The compass is gone.

655
01:01:24,176 --> 01:01:26,054
Fitzy, the engine died.

656
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,647
I've got it. I got it.
Nah, you don't.

657
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:43,698
You got about five seconds, boys.

658
01:01:43,764 --> 01:01:47,160
It's gravity pad, it doesn't trace out...
I know!

659
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,376
Come on, light up!

660
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:18,528
Maske? Get back here.

661
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:28,124
Tide's rising! It'll get us through.

662
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:32,086
But let me know what's coming.

663
01:04:25,758 --> 01:04:29,928
Hey Fitz!? We've been over the bar.
Back to spotlight.

664
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:34,976
Comin' out.

665
01:04:49,758 --> 01:04:51,794
We turned too late!

666
01:04:53,678 --> 01:04:55,680
We gotta buy time back!

667
01:04:55,847 --> 01:05:00,517
Tell Sybert we need 30 degrees within the
next two minutes or we'll miss that shole.

668
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:05,021
30 degrees in the next two minutes..

669
01:05:05,189 --> 01:05:08,149
30 degrees in the next two minutes..

670
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:11,527
30 degrees in the next two minutes..

671
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:13,829
30 degrees in the next two minutes..

672
01:05:19,243 --> 01:05:22,579
Puttin' her in reverse.
You gotta let the ocean push us.

673
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:25,081
Hold on.

674
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:31,847
Maybe you wanna brace yourself, Eldon.

675
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:35,476
318...

676
01:06:40,939 --> 01:06:42,899
316...

677
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:47,844
Close it down as soon as she hits!

678
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:49,905
312...

679
01:07:01,082 --> 01:07:03,792
Gentlemen! Brace yourselves.

680
01:07:05,419 --> 01:07:06,670
Hold on!

681
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:14,677
Now!

682
01:08:18,025 --> 01:08:19,158
Well...

683
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:27,866
You did it! It bloody well worked, Mr.Sybert!

684
01:08:31,244 --> 01:08:34,664
You gotta keep the water away from
the air inlets of the engine.

685
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:38,208
We lose power, we lose our pumps.

686
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:43,922
I'm afraid, the way we're pullin' so much water,
wave will pull us off the shole.

687
01:08:48,301 --> 01:08:50,861
Feels funny not movin around, huh Eldon?

688
01:08:54,515 --> 01:08:57,725
Alright, lets get to it.

689
01:09:22,456 --> 01:09:24,791
We are headin' down to the lodge.
Everthing ok?

690
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,210
Quite down now, my God!
Give me a break.

691
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:31,555
I was on my way home and my car's been out into a ditch.
I need some help.

692
01:09:32,423 --> 01:09:34,024
Yeah alright, we live nearby.

693
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:37,210
We'll go back to my house. Call my brother.
He can till you out. Jump in.

694
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:43,641
Thank you.
You don't got a coat?

695
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:47,978
You can move that.
We're bringin' that from St.Martin's survivors.

696
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:54,442
I left my coat at the Coast Guard station.
Gotta man there?

697
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:55,818
Stop it.

698
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:00,906
He is not there now right now.
It's a...

699
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,953
It is Bernie Webber.
Yeah, Bernie is a good man.

700
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:26,595
We can't find 'em without a compass, Bernie.

701
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:30,098
We got no idea where they are.

702
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:34,560
Hold on.

703
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:07,923
You okay?

704
01:11:08,882 --> 01:11:12,886
You okay?
I'm havin' a great time out here, Bernie!

705
01:11:13,053 --> 01:11:14,379
Whole lot! Whole lotta fun here.

706
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:20,909
Brace yourselves!

707
01:11:34,196 --> 01:11:36,907
It's really nice here.

708
01:11:44,497 --> 01:11:48,917
Take it, use it.
Consider it done.

709
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,982
What's wrong with it!?
We lost the pumps.

710
01:11:57,049 --> 01:12:00,469
The pumps are chokin' the breakers.
Go check the connections.

711
01:12:02,972 --> 01:12:04,181
Give me the light.

712
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:10,061
It's onet of those damn...
Sometimes I wish I didn't understand.

713
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,064
Sybert, what's goin' on?

714
01:12:15,023 --> 01:12:17,067
We're usin' every pump we got.

715
01:12:18,026 --> 01:12:20,762
The jam the breakers and
the pumps wouldn't trickle.

716
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:25,241
We got another two feet of water before it hits
the air in engine and then the ship's dead.

717
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,844
Jesus Christ.
Do you hear that?

718
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:33,131
The tide's rising workin' us up the shole.
Fellas, that give us some time.

719
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:36,917
Isn't that right, Mr.Sybert?
That's sure, is Bub.

720
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:40,796
As long as the generators keep the pumps goin'.

721
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:44,649
By however we buy some more time.

722
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:46,926
You wanna be to be the man, Sybert right?
Well now you are the man.

723
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:50,179
You got no wife, got no kids back home?

724
01:12:51,848 --> 01:12:56,935
You're a single man always hidin' down below.
What do you gotta lose?

725
01:12:57,102 --> 01:12:58,386
Enough, Brown.

726
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:03,107
I'm afraid, Brown.

727
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:06,193
Gotta a life, same as you.

728
01:13:11,031 --> 01:13:13,825
Just don't see sittin' around,
talkin' about it.

729
01:13:18,371 --> 01:13:23,684
Station Chatham, 36500.
Station Chatham, 36500, do you copy?

730
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:28,454
Station Chatham,
this is Chief Bangs, CG-36383,

731
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:33,342
Pollock lightship, CG-36500, do you copy?

732
01:13:33,717 --> 01:13:36,929
Why can't they hear us, Bernie?
We hear them.

733
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:41,299
Tide is too high, zero head way.
Station Chatham, do you copy?

734
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:42,985
I repeat, we're comin' home.

735
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:46,696
Station Chatham, 36383,
return to Old Harbor.

736
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:50,316
Pollock lightship, CG-36500, do you copy?

737
01:13:50,482 --> 01:13:52,150
We are all alone.

738
01:13:52,943 --> 01:13:55,768
You heard, Bangs, on the Radio like he's
out goin' all back in but couldn't get out...

739
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:58,723
and the storm's gets worse...

740
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,009
We must return back, Webber.

741
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:06,613
We've come farther than anybody
ever thought possible, Bernie!

742
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:11,918
Maybe Richie is right!
Maybe we should just go back!

743
01:14:12,085 --> 01:14:18,423
The wind is eight to nine.
Repeat, Wind eight to nine. Heavy snowfall.

744
01:14:18,591 --> 01:14:20,333
You heard Bangs on the radio.

745
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:23,428
We have no compass and
we have no way to communicate.

746
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:30,976
You are...
What? What? I'm what Ritchie?

747
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:38,191
I got us this far, didn't I?
Not Bangs not Cluff, but I did it!

748
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:46,240
We did it, Richie.

749
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,745
You wanna turn back around?

750
01:14:53,997 --> 01:14:57,299
No, not now! We came too far.

751
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,668
We are not gonna leave 'em.

752
01:15:02,295 --> 01:15:04,130
Not on my watch.

753
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:08,009
Just do your job.

754
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:15,515
Hey Fitz, turn off the beam.
We'll work in the dark.

755
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:19,018
We can see the light of the
Pendleton better in the dark.

756
01:15:26,858 --> 01:15:28,235
Watch it.

757
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:35,441
Get back here.

758
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:39,086
Get your buds back here.

759
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:41,955
I lost my hat.

760
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:08,953
You okay?

761
01:16:10,855 --> 01:16:16,694
Yeah, I'm just tired.
Come on.

762
01:16:21,406 --> 01:16:23,366
You kids go play in the bedroom, ok?

763
01:16:23,633 --> 01:16:25,777
You can wait.
Let me call my brother.

764
01:16:25,797 --> 01:16:28,688
Thanks. Call me Mariam.

765
01:16:46,003 --> 01:16:48,380
You think your mother would
mind if I turn on the radio?

766
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:58,314
Coast Boston, this is the Unimak.

767
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:01,558
We are first at the Mercer bow
her now at the Port of Yakutat.

768
01:17:01,624 --> 01:17:05,378
Four Mercer crew members jumped from the deck.
All are lost.

769
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:09,866
I repeat, four men lost.
Several crew members have hypothermia.

770
01:17:10,032 --> 01:17:14,119
We'll wait for daybreak to attempt another rescue.
Over.

771
01:17:15,996 --> 01:17:20,658
Does no good listenin' to all that chatter, Mariam.
Better to live not knowin'.

772
01:17:25,552 --> 01:17:27,552
...it would be 1900 hours...

773
01:17:32,552 --> 01:17:35,554
How long have you been married to Bernie for?
We are...

774
01:17:40,308 --> 01:17:42,269
We're not married yet.

775
01:17:44,729 --> 01:17:48,015
I didn't know if...
Like I said, Bernie is a good man.

776
01:17:52,236 --> 01:17:56,573
Him and some of them others try gettin' out one year ago saved my husband Arnie and the crew of the Landry.

777
01:17:56,948 --> 01:18:00,285
They were out on the boat night time off
Nantucket when the boat started takin' water.

778
01:18:00,451 --> 01:18:02,203
A night just like this.

779
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:06,165
Come on, we gotta get goin'.

780
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:09,576
Brother's on his way to come meet us.
I gotta get to the lodge, come on, you two.

781
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:47,881
because people said sit down sit down,
let you rock the boat 753

782
01:18:49,215 --> 01:18:54,013
* Cause people said sit, down sit down *
* you rock the boat *

783
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:59,812
* the devil you can pull down *
* the sharp edges of your jacket *

784
01:19:09,614 --> 01:19:11,375
* Sit down, sit down, sit down *

785
01:19:55,694 --> 01:19:57,137
Do you know who she is?

786
01:19:58,214 --> 01:20:02,335
Ain't Bernie's fault, Carlin.
No one's fault. It's like her blaming you.

787
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:04,680
For what?

788
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:08,159
You are the one that told me there was no
other ship out there because of you, right?

789
01:21:25,317 --> 01:21:28,153
Fitz, turn on the searchlight.

790
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,398
I can't believe we found her.
Look at that!

791
01:22:23,678 --> 01:22:27,558
We're too late.
It's a ghost ship.

792
01:22:31,946 --> 01:22:34,101
Are you seeing this, sir?
Yeah.

793
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:36,901
Yeah, yeah...I see him.

794
01:22:36,777 --> 01:22:38,529
Not sure I believe it!

795
01:22:41,782 --> 01:22:43,952
Where is the hell's he goin'?

796
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:53,922
Good to see you boys.

797
01:23:00,728 --> 01:23:02,228
Careful.

798
01:23:08,982 --> 01:23:14,154
How are we gonna fit them all on this boat?
We were told to fit only 12, including us.

799
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:17,367
Those are just regulation, right?

800
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:23,415
How many could you fit?

801
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,502
20, 22 tops.

802
01:23:29,131 --> 01:23:30,298
Wait.

803
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:32,134
They comin' out here.

804
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:58,173
Try the station, Port side.

805
01:24:28,617 --> 01:24:30,578
Come on, I got you.

806
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:52,512
We got ya.

807
01:25:02,282 --> 01:25:03,658
Maske, get over here!

808
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,748
Come on.
Grab him.

809
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,771
You know where you goin' on, Miss?

810
01:25:28,855 --> 01:25:30,190
I think so.

811
01:25:30,908 --> 01:25:32,735
Thanks for your help, Mr.Nickerson.

812
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:33,935
Yeah.

813
01:25:34,862 --> 01:25:36,164
You know...

814
01:25:37,323 --> 01:25:40,119
Bernie ain't out there, 'cause of me.
Yeah, I know.

815
01:25:41,588 --> 01:25:44,040
It's Bernie's job to go out, right?

816
01:25:47,544 --> 01:25:49,380
How can I blame me for it?

817
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:09,153
Nice and slow! Nice and slow.
Pete, you're up next.

818
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,199
Take it nice and slow! Take it easy.
Come on.

819
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:22,752
We gotta go!
We're leavin' nobody behind.

820
01:26:22,919 --> 01:26:25,614
Go on that ladder, Eldon.
We gotta get him down.

821
01:26:25,656 --> 01:26:27,356
We have no time.

822
01:26:27,388 --> 01:26:29,850
She's slippin'.
We gotta get off this ship.

823
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:31,880
Hurry!

824
01:26:32,055 --> 01:26:33,811
Eldon, how you doin'?

825
01:26:35,142 --> 01:26:36,936
I'm scared.

826
01:26:43,694 --> 01:26:47,406
Well...it's a lot scarier up here without us.
You gotta listen to me!

827
01:26:48,407 --> 01:26:50,763
Eldon?
We all gotta get down! Stop pushin'.

828
01:26:50,802 --> 01:26:55,866
Follow right behind me.
If I could do it, anyone can.

829
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:10,928
Come on.

830
01:27:25,677 --> 01:27:27,677
Hold on, Eldon.

831
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,593
Tiny, Tiny! Hold on.

832
01:28:36,661 --> 01:28:38,905
Eldon.

833
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:44,837
Eldon, look at me.
Look at me.

834
01:28:57,227 --> 01:28:59,938
When I jump say, let go.
Ready?

835
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:08,648
Jump.

836
01:29:12,996 --> 01:29:14,264
You good?

837
01:29:16,366 --> 01:29:17,666
Hold on tight.

838
01:29:23,133 --> 01:29:25,527
Alright! So heavy, you can hardly steer.

839
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:28,547
They are saying there are
seven or eight up there aboard.

840
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:35,731
Maybe...we take these guys back in...
come back out.

841
01:29:44,074 --> 01:29:47,995
Can't leave anybody alone.
That boat won't last.

842
01:29:50,415 --> 01:29:52,459
We all live or we all die.

843
01:29:55,171 --> 01:29:56,372
Right?

844
01:30:31,789 --> 01:30:33,750
You...aa..you did good.

845
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,721
You should be last one off, Mr.Sybert.

846
01:31:36,248 --> 01:31:37,534
Last man!

847
01:33:17,618 --> 01:33:21,332
Hey Fitz! Turn off that searchlight, yeah?

848
01:33:46,402 --> 01:33:48,655
We have radio contact with the McCullough.

849
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:54,120
I said they have lost four men, but saved the rest.
The captain of the Pollock Rip said...

850
01:33:54,287 --> 01:33:59,260
Mr.Cluff, it is 36500,
It's Bernie...right on the radio!

851
01:33:59,327 --> 01:34:03,365
Chatham, Chatham, you copy?

852
01:34:03,983 --> 01:34:08,763
CG-36500, this Station Chatham.
Webber, is that you?

853
01:34:08,929 --> 01:34:11,516
Yes, sir, it's me, Bernie.

854
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:17,774
We got 32 survivors aboard from the Pendleton, sir.

855
01:34:18,783 --> 01:34:20,493
Station Chatham, you copy?

856
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:26,033
36500, Station Chatham.
Did you say you have 32 survivors aboard!?

857
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:30,747
They rescued 'em! Rescued 32 of them.
Yes sir, 32...

858
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:34,276
We lost our compass,
so we don't know where we are...

859
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:36,220
but we'll try to make it back home.

860
01:34:36,554 --> 01:34:38,881
Can't come back without a compass.
Not in this weather.

861
01:34:38,919 --> 01:34:40,220
They can not go back.

862
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,262
You lost your compass Webber?

863
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:47,775
No. 36500, this is the Pollock lightship.
Do not proceed to the shore.

864
01:34:48,142 --> 01:34:51,563
We're 5 miles Northeast of last
location of Pendleton.

865
01:34:51,593 --> 01:34:55,765
Proceed to our position, over.
CG-36500, Station Chatham...

866
01:34:55,969 --> 01:35:00,224
proceed to Pollock lightship
and onboard all survivors.

867
01:35:01,408 --> 01:35:03,035
What do they know, right?

868
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:06,822
Right, Richie?

869
01:35:07,874 --> 01:35:10,294
CG-36500, you copy?

870
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:15,391
If they know where they are...

871
01:35:16,134 --> 01:35:18,896
someone tell me where I am because
I don't know where the hell we are.

872
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,749
Webber, do you copy?

873
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:26,321
I'm not going out to sea...no.
This is Station Chatham, do you copy?

874
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:31,911
We just got you off a boat,
there's no way we're gonna get you all up there.

875
01:35:31,978 --> 01:35:34,598
CG-36500, this is Station Chatham.

876
01:35:34,765 --> 01:35:40,747
Webber, your orders are to proceed 5 miles northeast
and onboard all survivors at the Pollock.

877
01:35:56,015 --> 01:36:00,311
Sounds like there's a cut on the radio, Mr.Cluff.
He's going at on his own.

878
01:36:01,638 --> 01:36:02,889
Bernie Webber.

879
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:05,768
What do you know?

880
01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:07,301
How do they get home?

881
01:36:07,324 --> 01:36:09,017
He turned off his radio.

882
01:36:11,567 --> 01:36:14,403
Poor guys! I can't believe this is happening.

883
01:36:23,122 --> 01:36:24,590
There's some more stuff in the car.

884
01:36:31,515 --> 01:36:33,342
The power went out.
How do they get home?

885
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:34,816
Powers out.

886
01:36:35,928 --> 01:36:39,057
The whole town! The powers out.

887
01:36:40,275 --> 01:36:42,903
It's worse than last year.
You never know.

888
01:37:01,258 --> 01:37:02,885
Let's get to the pier.

889
01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:15,200
How did you find us without a compass?

890
01:37:17,783 --> 01:37:21,992
We...we jodged with seasonal currents.

891
01:37:26,575 --> 01:37:28,575
Think we just got lucky.

892
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:29,875
Yeah.

893
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,442
Lucky.

894
01:37:38,075 --> 01:37:39,825
Well, you know how you get home?

895
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,408
To be honest with ya, I'm not sure.

896
01:37:45,358 --> 01:37:51,325
Just, disobeyed all my ranking officers.
They don't know. So I'm better than 'em, alright?

897
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:54,367
But the wind on my left goin' out.

898
01:37:54,825 --> 01:38:00,575
Even if I...keep it on the right,
we ought to be there in the right direction.

899
01:38:03,492 --> 01:38:07,200
We just follow all the lights on the shore.
Follow the lights on the shore.

900
01:38:20,492 --> 01:38:22,617
Well, we are in your hands, Captain.

901
01:38:32,575 --> 01:38:33,733
Listen up.

902
01:38:37,992 --> 01:38:40,075
I put the sea behind us.

903
01:38:42,033 --> 01:38:44,825
Just let it push us along,
till we land somewhere.

904
01:38:44,992 --> 01:38:50,367
Storm's easing' up boys, so..we just look
at the shore lights to guide us in.

905
01:38:50,533 --> 01:38:56,533
Even if we have to go so far as Nobska Point.
So be it! We just gonna find land!

906
01:39:01,075 --> 01:39:04,158
Been one heck of a long day, right fellas?

907
01:39:04,783 --> 01:39:07,908
Yeah, sure has!

908
01:39:09,992 --> 01:39:12,533
But don't you give up hope on me now.

909
01:39:14,742 --> 01:39:17,200
It's a good boat.
Will get us through.

910
01:39:19,617 --> 01:39:22,608
Will get you home, okay?
We are all goin' home.

911
01:39:24,242 --> 01:39:25,908
We are with you, Skipper.

912
01:42:50,575 --> 01:42:54,375
Keep the lights on, like she's doin'.
Turn your lights on.

913
01:42:54,442 --> 01:42:57,700
Turn on the lights, everyone.

914
01:42:58,367 --> 01:43:00,533
More light, so that they can see us.

915
01:43:50,283 --> 01:43:52,575
I think we made it over the bar.

916
01:43:56,117 --> 01:43:58,442
The thick tide there is over!

917
01:43:58,608 --> 01:44:01,525
You see that!?

918
01:44:23,617 --> 01:44:26,342
Fitz, turn on the searchlight.

919
01:44:57,875 --> 01:45:02,088
Look, you see that?
There are our boys!

920
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:14,333
Is it them?

921
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:18,758
Well done, Bernie.

922
01:45:19,283 --> 01:45:22,867
You did it, Webber!
Well done, Webber!

923
01:45:23,742 --> 01:45:26,617
36500 Chatham docking at the Chatham pier.

924
01:45:26,783 --> 01:45:31,050
Appear to be 32 survivors, sir.
I repeat: We have 32 survivors.

925
01:45:52,975 --> 01:45:54,542
Atta boy! Bernie.

926
01:46:05,375 --> 01:46:06,667
Give me the end.

927
01:46:07,617 --> 01:46:09,217
Cmon! Good to see you.
Come on over.

928
01:46:09,283 --> 01:46:11,708
Take it easy!

929
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:16,308
This man's freezing. Give him a coat.
Go on in, it's warm inside.

930
01:46:18,283 --> 01:46:19,783
Let's get you in the lodge.

931
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:22,250
Nice and easy. I got ya.

932
01:46:37,225 --> 01:46:38,775
Good job, Captain.

933
01:46:42,392 --> 01:46:43,725
Well done, Bernie.

934
01:46:57,005 --> 01:46:58,705
Webber?

935
01:47:25,017 --> 01:47:26,483
Bernie.

936
01:48:06,325 --> 01:48:07,833
Let's go.

937
01:48:41,167 --> 01:48:43,375
We still got 5 days until April 16.

938
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:44,975
Yeah...

939
01:48:46,733 --> 01:48:48,575
I asked Cluff for you.

940
01:48:50,175 --> 01:48:52,442
He said it's just a...
Formality.

941
01:48:54,317 --> 01:48:56,042
Now I know, right?
