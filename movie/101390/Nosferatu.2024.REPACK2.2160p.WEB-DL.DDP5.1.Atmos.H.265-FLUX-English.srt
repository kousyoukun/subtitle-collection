1
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,832
You.

2
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:52,029
You wakened me from an eternity
of darkness.

3
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,868
You... You...

4
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:03,498
You are not for the living.

5
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,086
You are not for human kind.

6
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:27,689
And shall you be one with me
ever-eternally?

7
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,402
Do you swear it?

8
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,635
Knock & Assoc. Estate Agents

9
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,634
What is all this barking?

10
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,094
Get out, you filthy gypsies!

11
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,554
You bring shame to my inn.

12
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,974
And you bring me trouble.

13
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,691
By God's name, never
speak of that castle.

14
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,777
Return to your
country, foreigner.

15
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,320
Shut your mouths!

16
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,782
May the holy mind
of God bugger you!

17
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,002
I banish you, I banish
you with garlic.

18
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,032
Please, please don't go there.

19
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,367
Beware of his shadow.

20
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,494
The shadow covers
you in a nightmare.

21
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,870
Awake, but a dream.

22
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,748
There is no escape.

23
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,458
Pray.

24
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,836
Pray, Pray.

25
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,084
Bless this virgin child.

26
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,670
Bless her.

27
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:24,009
Guide our stallion to
the unclean spirit.

28
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,873
The vampire!

29
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,168
The vampire's grave!

30
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,297
The vampire!

31
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,138
Find his tail!

32
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,390
His cloven hooves!

33
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,310
Silence!

34
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,770
Silence!

35
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,191
God send you burst!

36
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,734
Lilac.

37
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:42,239
Your husband is lost to you.

38
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,118
Dream of me.

39
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,246
Only me.

40
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,377
Only me.

41
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:12,859
Soon I will no longer
be a shadow to you.

42
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:19,657
Soon our flesh shall embrace

43
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:24,246
and we shall be as one.

44
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:31,795
Nature, increase thy thunders

45
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:40,262
and hasten me upon the wings
of thy barbarous winds.

46
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,378
Quick, Captain.

47
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,921
Back to the
quarterdeck with you.

48
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,841
But Vasilyev. And now Redenko.

49
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,848
Captain, it's the plague.

50
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,023
Quarantine the sick!

51
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,441
The Devil!

52
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,444
Our cargo is cursed.

53
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,281
Back away! Back away!

54
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,909
Out! Everyone out!

55
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,476
I will end this
plague. This devil.

56
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:38,808
Two more nights.

57
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,824
Wake not.

58
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:58,809
Behold, the third night.

59
01:59:19,486 --> 01:59:23,490
You accept this
of your own will?

60
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:32,707
Then the covenant is fulfilled.

61
01:59:34,042 --> 01:59:37,379
Your oath re-pledged.

62
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:45,762
Your oath re-pledged.

63
01:59:46,846 --> 01:59:50,767
so too shall be our flesh.

64
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:57,982
You are mine.
