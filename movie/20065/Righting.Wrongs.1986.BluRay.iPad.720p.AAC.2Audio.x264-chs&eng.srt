1
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,170
你真不愧为罪恶克星      谢谢
You did it again - thank you

2
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,699
教授，每场官司这样打下去，迟早会…
professor, you keep taking these big case,
sooner or later...

3
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,303
对付那些无法无天的歹徒
I know. You have to do what is necessary

4
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,431
最好的办法就是不择手段
to deal with these low-lived scumballs

5
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,876
教授，你不觉得很危险吗？
but professor, can't you think it
might put your own life in danger?

6
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,980
养虎为患更加危险
True, but it's more dangerous
if they're out in society

7
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,321
你跟了我那么久，你迟早都要独立
One of these days you'll be on your own

8
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,657
你这次返香港我没有什么送给你
I don't have much of a gift for you
when you go back to hk

9
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,828
这本书会对你很有用的
but this book here should be useful to you

10
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,331
不要向罪恶低头
when you're fighting against crime

11
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,875
我不会令你失望的
I won't let you down

12
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,460
教授，小心
professor, look out

13
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,087
我们离开这里
Come on, let's get out of here

14
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,311
离开这里，走      神经病
- Keep it. Get out of this place, go on, go
- You're crazy

15
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,539
活该
Shit

16
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,749
小心
no. Look out

17
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,400
正经一点
Be serious

18
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,818
吃饭了，不要玩
eat, don't play

19
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,403
好波呀
good

20
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,091
怎么不听话呀？
Why don't you listen to me?

21
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,845
警察叔叔，你看
Officer, look

22
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,019
截住他
Stop him

23
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,729
B仔呀
baby

24
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:06,658
妈咪…
Mammy...

25
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,665
老板，那些东西搞掂了没有？
Boss, have you fixed everything?

26
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:56,958
搞掂了
Yes

27
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,209
OK
ok

28
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,341
夏先生
Mr hsia

29
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,277
法官大人，我刚刚接到医院来的报告
Your honor, I got a hospital report

30
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,322
我的控方证人梁二胜一家八口
the whole liang family, eight of them

31
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,116
已经全部证实死亡
had been murdered

32
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,834
由于梁二胜死了
Now my witness liang is silenced

33
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,072
我现在已经没有其他有有的证人
I have no other witness to testify against

34
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,467
指证这两位先生走私贩毒
these 2 gentlemen's drug-trafficking

35
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,344
谋财害命的罪行
& killings

36
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,846
他们又可以逍遥法外
so they can now be scot free

37
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,974
反对，反对，反对
objection, objection, objection

38
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,393
反对有效
objection sustained

39
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,604
夏检控官，小心你的用词
mr hsia, watch your language

40
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,900
这本书所记载的，不单止是法律的条文
this book doesn't contain
legal articles alone

41
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,405
它还应该代表社会的正义和人类的尊严
they also represent social
justice & human dignity

42
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,474
但是它现在开始接受了挑战
but it is now being challenged

43
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,243
反对，法官大人
objection, your honor

44
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,436
我认为夏检控官
I think mr hsia's wasting

45
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,497
在浪费我两位当事人的宝贵时间
my clients' time

46
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,999
反对有效
objection sustained

47
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,750
你长话短说吧
cut short your speech

48
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,880
我老师曾经对我说，法律是人写出来的
my teacher told me that man made the law

49
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,759
当它一旦失去主持正义，维护尊严的时候
when it doesn't uphold righteousness

50
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,829
就应该有人出来面对罪恶的挑战
someone should stand up to challenge crime

51
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,680
反对
objection

52
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,681
法官大人
your honor

53
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,765
不用反对了
no objections are needed

54
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,604
本席宣判押后至7月14日再度聆讯，退庭
the hearing is adjourned to July 14

55
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,565
COURT
court

56
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,039
谢谢
Thank you

57
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,263
怎么样？夏检控官，又无罪释放？
How's it, sir? Acquitted again?

58
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,015
控方证人被人杀了
The prosecution witness has been murdered

59
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,252
证人死了，怪不得周鼎光…
no wonder chou ting-kuang

60
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,146
刚才在门口指着我鼻子说
pointed at my nose

61
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,066
想尽办法拉我好了，我后台有很多律师
challenging me to arrest him

62
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,428
夏检控官，法律究竟是保护市民
mr hsia, does the law protect

63
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,780
还是维护不法之徒
the citizens or outlaws?

64
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,450
我会亲自证明这东西
I'll try to prove this personally

65
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,416
明知犯了法也判不到他有罪
Don't you feel sorry being

66
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,918
你不觉得遗憾吗？
unable to sue the guilty?

67
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,504
遗憾可以解决问题吗？
Feeling sorry won't solve the problem

68
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,425
不过还是有办法解决的
there must be a solution

69
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:53,952
像这样子

70
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,221
照你们估计被告会不会有罪呢？
do you assume the defendants guilty or not?

71
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,431
不知道，不要碍着
No idea

72
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,940
一枪一个，好像打雀鸟一样，真痛快
I'll shoot them one after another

73
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,401
好，你这么有兴趣，我送枝猎枪给你
good, I'll send you a shotgun

74
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,279
再转行做律师，我替你辩护
then I become a lawyer to defend you

75
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,617
我老了，会手震
my hands tremble. I'm getting old

76
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,995
不如你来吧，到时我判你无罪
you do it, and I'll acquit you

77
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,039
你讲过要作算的
are you serious?

78
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,064
真聪明，叔叔送个公仔给你好吗？
You're clever. Take this doll

79
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,026
叔叔，你怎么知道我取到一百分呀？
how do you know I got full marks, uncle?

80
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,654
叔叔知道珠女乖，就买个公仔送给你
I know you're nice, so
ll've bought you this

81
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,931
叔叔，我请你吃雪糕
uncle, I'll buy you ice-cream

82
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,032
好呀
okay

83
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,369
爸爸给我钱
daddy, give me money

84
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,122
又说你请？去买啦
you promised to buy it. Go on

85
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:06,916
考虑得怎么样了？
what's your decision?

86
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,335
警方调查了他们三年
After 3 years' investigation

87
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,504
文件做满了八个抽屉
by the police

88
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,465
虽然没有人够胆出庭指证他们犯法
with documents piled up

89
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,342
但是有你一个出来指证
I'm 100% sure I can prosecute them

90
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,511
我有百分之一百的信心入罪他们
with you as the only witness

91
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,832
我一家八口，如果有三长两短，他们…
what if anything happens to my family of 87

92
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,975
不会有事的
you're going to be alright

93
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,728
放心啦，我保证
I assure you

94
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,649
先生，请你把球还给我
please pass me the ball, sir?

95
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,486
你叫什么名？
What's your name?

96
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,697
我叫肥仔
I'm fatty

97
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,599
叔叔，这里不可以停车的
uncle, you can't park here

98
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,367
警察叔叔会拉你的
or the police may sue you

99
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,368
谢谢你
thank you

100
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,536
拜拜
bye-bye

101
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,746
拜拜
bye-bye

102
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,507
一家八口被你干掉，皇冠牌，你都算毒了
You're wicked, you killed at 8 members

103
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,761
看以后还有谁敢笃你两位大哥背脊
see if anyone dare to backbite you again

104
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,430
做得好，这些钱你收到没有？
well done. Have you got the money?

105
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,057
收到了，谢谢
Yes, thank you

106
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,853
那行了，有什么事我们再联络，拜拜
good, let's get in touch again. Bye-bye

107
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,774
只会伸手要钱
he knows nothing but asking for money

108
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,904
老卫，这买卖我们净赚多少？
wel, how much can we get on this?

109
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,364
一千万
$10 million

110
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,242
什么？一千万？
what? $10 million?

111
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,993
不是千五万吗？
Not $14 million?

112
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,121
五百万落了皇冠牌的袋里
The $5 million has gone to "crown"

113
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,874
老周，我们只求安乐
chou, it's worthwhile

114
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,376
这些钱不可以节省的
if we can live in peace

115
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,835
安乐的是他
he stands to gain

116
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,588
钱就会要，黑锅就不用他
he got the money without bearing the blame

117
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,423
害得我们在法庭上现世
but we are humiliated in court

118
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,968
早知道如此就用不着跟他合伙做了
we shouldn't have worked with him

119
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,263
算啦，如果不是他，我们还在吃皇家饭呢
we'd have still been in jail then

120
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,767
什么？要我们吃皇家饭
in jail?

121
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:53,147
如果我们吃皇家饭，到时他吃金银衣纸了
He'd have been in hell

122
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,275
老周，这里讲这里散好了
chou, don't say that in public

123
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,530
讲狠，皇冠牌比我和你狠
"crown" is much tougher than we

124
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,826
如果被他知道我们不合作，他会先郁我们
had he known we went against him,
he might have ruined us

125
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,286
郁我们？
ruined us?

126
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,541
现在讲郁，郁的是身家，不是胆色

127
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,003
你怎么说也好，凡事都是小心点好
Anyway, we must watch out

128
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,422
我回去搞掂那笔数目
I'll go and fix that amount

129
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,717
你通知兄弟们明天来拿钱
tell them to get the money tomorrow

130
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,929
老卫，你都要小心点呀
wel, you must be alert

131
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:06,929
卫先生
Mr wei

132
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,862
你两个在这里等我
Wait for me here, please

133
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:23,905
是
yes

134
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,854
老板出事了
The boss is in trouble

135
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,744
老板
Boss

136
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:37,914
撞！
crash!

137
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,723
老板
Boss

138
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,193
喂，周老板，我是阿洪
Hello, mr chou, this is hung

139
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,694
老板被人干掉了
the boss was bumped off

140
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,197
你听着，立刻拿这些钱来我家里
listen, bring the money to my home

141
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,615
是，我立刻来
yes, I'll come right away

142
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,682
七万
7-number

143
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,233
糟了，什么六也没有
Bad, no more 6-number

144
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,947
六万
6-number

145
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,391
兄弟，你有没有搞错？
what's the matter with you?

146
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,368
明明是四万，你说是六万？
It's 4-number, not 6-number

147
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,330
我说六万就是六万
I said 6-number

148
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,375
是你说六万的，我碰
you said it. I take

149
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,378
你现在当我是聋哑还是失明呀？
don't take me for a nut

150
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,340
只是六万也不足够，是什么位呀？
6-number is not enough. What position?

151
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,550
东风东位
East

152
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,869
我不管你中风，总之这只是四万
anyway, this is 4-number,

153
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,887
不是六万
not 6-number

154
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,639
不要吵，我食糊
quiet! I make

155
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,811
食糊？诈糊就有你的份儿
make? Stop dreaming

156
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,063
CID
cid

157
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,691
官字两个口，你说食糊就食糊啦
okay, a police officer has the say

158
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,611
师姐最大，你说什么就什么好了
yes, madam

159
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,076
大水牛
Buffalo

160
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,954
走开，不要碍着我发财
keep away! I'm gambling

161
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,540
我大水牛打牌的时候是戒色的
and I keep away from sex when I do

162
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,881
通常够胆揭我底牌只有两种人
only 2 persons can see my hole card

163
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,759
一是我老婆，一是我契家婆
my wife and my mistress

164
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,511
你只不过是鬼婆
you're only a caucassian woman

165
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,852
差婆又怎么样？
What's so special being a female cop?

166
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,772
我告诉你，这里是麻雀馆
Listen, this is mahjong school

167
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,440
不是差馆
not a police station

168
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,989
在公众场场所不要乱拔东西出来
Don't draw wantonly in public

169
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,245
师姐，看清楚环境才好动手呀
madam, take it east

170
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,540
鬼婆向来踢窦，双眼永远有前无后
when I come to storm, I never turn round

171
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,000
我怎么会向后望这三个擦鞋仔呀？
I won't turn round to look
at you apple-polishers

172
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,087
听到没有？师姐说你们是擦鞋仔
she calls you apple-polishers! Hear that?

173
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,172
还不替师姐擦鞋？
Polish her apple now

174
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,931
师姐，锁得这么厉害，当心你的晚年
Madam, be gentle. It's
good for your old age

175
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,810
阿SIR，是他们
they did it, sir

176
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,228
别动
stay where you are!

177
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,813
是他们四人，拉他们吧
They did it. Take them

178
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,398
起身
stand up

179
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,900
一个手铐锁四个人
one pair of handcuffs for four

180
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,402
师姐，汪SIR急电要你回去
madam, mr wang called to see you

181
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,529
知道了，替我拉他们回去
good. Take them for me

182
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,365
告他们企图谋杀，贩卖毒品
book them for attempted
murder, dope-pushing

183
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,327
袭警拒捕，掳人勒索，还有…
assaulting, kidnapping and...

184
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
还有？还有什么？
And what?

185
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,042
面目可憎
They look disgusting

186
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,668
拉他们回去      好
take them back - yes

187
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,921
你都算衰了
you're damned

188
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,923
走吧
get going

189
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,284
好呀，正呀
good, good

190
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,304
小弟初来此地，小小的东西不好意思
I'm new here. Only a small thing

191
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,847
这件你的
this is yours truly, help yourself

192
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,140
吃吧，不用客气
help yourself

193
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,728
吃吧，不用客气
help yourself

194
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,814
吃吧，很好呀
eat. It's nice

195
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,527
师姐，吃一件后才打字吧，不用那么心急
madam, eat. Forget your work now

196
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,364
怎么你吃得这样不干净呀
you've made such a mess

197
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,865
很好吃的
it's palatable

198
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,285
住在哪里？家里电话几号？
where do you live? Your home number?

199
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,312
阿SIR，不要告诉我老婆呀
Don't ever tell my wife, sir

200
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,872
这么怕老婆你又干？
why are you so henpecked?

201
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,375
师兄，让我表现一下
Brother, let me

202
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,820
表现还表现，请你把手拿开
take your hand off me, please

203
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,421
你搞掂他
you fix him

204
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:20,965
坐那边
sit over there

205
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,552
看看你激得阿SIR这么不高兴
look, you've made him mad

206
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:25,928
哀什么呀？
what's your charge?

207
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,888
非礼
Indecent assault

208
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,391
非礼？很平常的
it's quite normal

209
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,892
非礼什么人呀？
how did you do it?

210
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,687
摸一下鬼婆的屁股而已
I caressed the ass of a foreign girl

211
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,480
什么？鬼婆？
what? Foreign girl?

212
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,525
鬼婆的屁股你也要摸？
How could you do such a thing?

213
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,652
罕有嘛
It's rare

214
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,988
罕有？大笨象也是罕有
rare? Elephants are rare too

215
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,323
香港只有一只，你又不去摸？
there's only one in hk

216
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,827
街上那么多中国女人你不摸，摸鬼婆？
why did you choose to
do that to a foreigner?

217
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,412
你都算种族歧视了
You must be racially prejudiced

218
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,538
她有什么好呀？
why did you do it?

219
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,331
我以为她不会叫非礼嘛
Because she can't shout in Chinese

220
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,542
不会叫非礼的你就摸
I see

221
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,336
你做人真没有原则，这不过是鬼婆嘛
you have no scruples

222
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:05,050
你自己看看，红毛就绿眼，卷毛就勾鼻
look, green eyes, curly
hair and hooked nose

223
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,344
我对他说你很美丽
I say to him you're beautiful

224
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,307
还有呀，腰粗就屁股大，肚腩就大过胸
and she has a big waist and big potbelly

225
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,227
远看似番薯，近看像棵大树
she looks like a tree at close range

226
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,772
还有满面雀斑，没有品味
and she has freckles and no feminine touch

227
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,817
我说你有品味
I say you've good taste

228
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,443
谢谢
thank you

229
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,530
手似熊掌，脚似…
her hands are like bear
palms, her feet are...

230
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,573
似龙船
Like a dragon boat

231
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,910
不错，似龙船
yes, like a dragon boat

232
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,078
原来你懂的
so you understand Chinese

233
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,565
告诉他我是谁？
tell him who I am

234
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,500
打散仔的当然是帮办
a tough one must be an inspector

235
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,960
你也会被人打的吗？
so even you got beaten

236
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,420
别吵      走开
- quiet!
- Keep away

237
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,589
你知不知道你衰什么？
do you know what's wrong with you?

238
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,031
哀什么呀？
What?

239
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,090
哀勤力呀
You're working too hard

240
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:45,758
是吗？
is that so?

241
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,054
去了哪里？找了你大半天了
Where have you been?

242
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,972
我去了查案，阿SIR
Working on a case, sir

243
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,850
我知道，难道你偷懒吗？
I know you're hardworking

244
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,644
我想告诉你一个好消息
listen,

245
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,354
卫成昨晚被人杀了
wei Cheng was murdered

246
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,148
真是个好消息，到底是谁做的好事？
good news. Who did it?

247
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,859
照理应该是鬼打鬼，黑吃黑
Must be a double dealer

248
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,278
不过身为警务人员
a policeman must round up anyone

249
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,531
就算杀人的是罗宾汉都一样要捉
even if he were a Robin hood

250
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,158
真矛盾
what a mockery

251
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,619
没有矛盾，这件案交给我做
let me take it over

252
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,746
你当然是首席人选
you're the best choice

253
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,790
不过今次我想多派一个人帮你
but I'll bring you an assistant

254
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,899
阿SIR，你也知道
you know,

255
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,168
我一向做事不喜欢找人帮手的
I never need help, sir

256
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,461
我看不用了
that won't be necessary

257
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,922
仙蒂，这件事不是那么简单
Cindy, it's not a simple case

258
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,715
我怕你应付不来
I'm afraid you can't handle it alone

259
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:27,925
阿SIR…
sir...

260
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,053
不要说了，就当是命令吧
Well, this is an order

261
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,015
好啦，这个人就让我自己去找吧
okay, let me find him then

262
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,521
这么近也掷不中，你的眼界不是这么差吧
you aimed badly

263
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,380
对不起
sorry

264
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,482
不用客气      对不起
never mind - sorry

265
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,362
对不起，MADAM
sorry, madam

266
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,279
不用对不起
how long have you been

267
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,681
你告诉我你在警界做了这么久
in the police force?

268
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,200
有什么事迹可以说出来威风一下
Have you done anything remarkable?

269
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,994
MADAM，到现在为止我仍是怀才不遇
Madam, I've still not won recognition

270
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,205
那就是无料到，对吗？
no one has recognized you?

271
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,164
是
No

272
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,000
由今天开始，你跟我办事
As of today, you work for me

273
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,293
YES，MADAM
yes, madam

274
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,588
我看起你是因为你没用，走吧
don't think I admire your talent. Get going

275
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,721
收工去喝茶
Let's have tea after work

276
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,555
站着
stand there

277
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:16,640
你做什么？
what is it?

278
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,106
做什么？看你的样子像烂仔，还吸烟
You look like a hooligan. You're smoking

279
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,774
这里不准吸烟的，知道吗？
no smoking here, understand?

280
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,276
够了
Enough

281
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,403
过来，过来
come here, come here

282
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,446
干什么？
what is it?

283
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,949
不要多说话，我知道你袋里一定藏有香烟
Quiet! I know you've
cigarettes in your pocket

284
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,826
把袋里所有东西拿出来
show me everything

285
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,077
老兄呀
brother

286
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:37,995
快点
hurry up

287
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,250
我知道你又是…
I know you...

288
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:44,626
干什么？
What is it?

289
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,589
穿鞋不穿袜，头发蓬松
You look haggard, disheveled hair, no socks

290
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,883
你看看，须又不剃
look, you need a shave

291
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,343
是不是不整洁也有罪呀？
is it an offence to be untidy?

292
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,471
你还驳嘴，信不信我打你？
Don't talk back. I may use force

293
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,139
够了      岂有此理，你…
enough - outrageous, you...

294
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,626
1750      YES，MADAM
1750 - yes, madam

295
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,312
让我来介绍，这位是我的新拍档
this is my new colleague

296
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,025
MADAM，不用介绍了，我认识他三十年了
madam, I've known him for 30 years

297
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,279
三十年？你今年三十二岁了，哀仔
30 years? You're already 32, bastard

298
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,156
两岁之前你没有见过爸爸吗？
didn't you see your father before 2?

299
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,433
原来你们是俩父子
So you're father and son

300
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,451
是
yes

301
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,913
话是这样说，是真是假他才知道
but he knows better

302
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,581
你个哀仔
you're damned

303
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,210
老兄，你想收买人命吗？
are you trying to kill?

304
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,503
当心车呀，哀仔
Watch out, son

305
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,879
我会，爸爸
I will, daddy

306
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,839
名牌车呀
a famous brand

307
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,884
MADAM，去哪里？送你一程好吗？
where are you going, madam?
I'll give you a lift

308
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,096
不用了，我一向不习惯坐这么名贵的汽车
I'm not used to such a limousine

309
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,098
找苦来辛是没罪的
it's not guilty to walk

310
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,020
守你这地头都不错
you must be okay

311
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,231
有这样的名牌的保时捷
to have the Porsche

312
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,732
人家有个好爸爸
you also have a daddy,

313
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,776
你也有一个，不过穷一点
but a poor one

314
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,030
MADAM，他很蠢的，你要教教他呀
madam, he needs your guidance

315
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,701
危险的工作不要让他做
don't give him any dangerous mission

316
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,620
因为我只有一个儿子
he's my only son

317
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,897
好，你放心，危险的工作我会打头阵的
don't worry, I know

318
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:04,706
谢谢
thank you

319
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,960
爸爸，你整天都是这么嗦
daddy, what a nagger you are

320
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,506
有空叫他多读点英文才行
he must learn more english

321
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,890
你做什么？
What are you doing?

322
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,850
跟你办事
To work for you

323
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,686
不用了，上面又高，风又大
no, it's windy and high

324
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,604
无谓要你爸爸担心
your dad may worry

325
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,315
留在这里看守车辆，这里最安全了
it's safer to watch the cars here

326
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:35,779
什么事？
what's it?

327
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,115
我是皇家师姐，带我上去看看
I'm madam. Take me up to have a look

328
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,366
好，你跟我来
okay, follow me

329
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,870
这个天台很大的
this roof is big

330
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,498
这是冷气喉，电梯机房在那边
the air-conditioning duct
the engine room's over there

331
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,208
电掣房在那边
the switch room is over there

332
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,377
那边是太平梯，我带你去看看
over there is the exit. Let me show you

333
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,716
等一等，师姐
wait, madam

334
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,134
自己人
a friend

335
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,471
什么自己人？我跟警察是世仇
what? I ate police

336
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,683
师姐，不用神气，大不了把车驶开
madam, at worst I'll drive away

337
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,896
我抄一张牌是11秒，你自己会该怎么做了
it takes me 11 seconds to ticket you

338
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,668
等一等，挞了火没有？驾驾执照呢？
Wait, have you started?
Your driving licence?

339
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,171
无牌驾驾？
Driving without a licence?

340
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,505
有呀
I have a licence

341
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,803
是临时的
A provisional one

342
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,723
明天就考，还有二十四小时
I'm taking the driving test tomorrow

343
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,475
师姐，我一定合格的
I must pass for sure, madam

344
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,227
你这么说即是希望我给你一次机会？
you want me to give you a break?

345
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,354
是
Yes

346
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,855
你没希望了
I love to

347
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,691
我这个人最喜欢落井下石，赶尽杀绝
kick dying people

348
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,194
不要，大家都是打皇家工
we're both civil servants

349
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,404
你不是想多给我一张吧？
are you going to give me one more”?

350
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,989
够了
Enough

351
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,325
希望你以后不会再遇见我
don't let me see you again

352
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,793
叫你看守车子一会儿也会被人抄牌
So you got ticketed so easily

353
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,628
你不觉得惭愧吗？
do you feel ashamed?

354
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,798
师姐，渔翁撒网，避无可避
Madam, I can't help it

355
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,341
你自己看看吧
see for yourself

356
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,530
好，调查一下他的身世
Well, let me check his background

357
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,856
读书多真的会坏脑子
Overstudying makes you a moron

358
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,900
想用法律令我坐牢？
trying to use law to put me in jail?

359
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,696
不用脑子去想想
Remember,

360
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,533
我的江山是用拳头打回来的
we got everything with our fists

361
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:13,080
老板，不如让我去教训他，让他知难而退
boss, let me teach him a lesson

362
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,459
有钱就连拳头也不用自己动
money makes the more run

363
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,294
找别人来干掉他
get someone to do it

364
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,170
是
yes

365
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:25,342
我要他能吃不能睡，能坐不能走
I'll make him a cripple

366
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,455
你记住，再有下一次，我就不再担保你
next time I can't bail you out

367
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,015
让你入感化院了
to get you into a reformatory

368
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,561
行了，北斗星，你的爱心和真诚打动了我
north star, you've touched my heart

369
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,105
我从此做个好人了
I promose to turn over a new leaf

370
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,606
你要说得出做得到才好
do you really mean it?

371
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,692
你这么苦口婆心，浪子也回头了
I've decided to turn over a new leaf

372
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,780
好，有救，知道自己是浪子
good

373
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,699
说得对，醒目仔
right, you're smart

374
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,284
你的女朋友？
your girlfriend?

375
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,328
做那一行呀？
What do you do?

376
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,287
检控官
A prosecutor

377
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,791
我不想讲再见了，两位慢慢谈，拜拜
excuse me. Bye-bye

378
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,169
他有两次偷窃案底
he has had two previous convictions

379
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,879
幸好我只有一次
luckily I only have one

380
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,798
你偷了什么？
what have you stolen?

381
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,967
偷心
A heart

382
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,660
今天你伤心了
excuse me,

383
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,054
我有很多工作做，没有空陪你
I'm busy

384
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,765
就是他
it was him

385
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,102
拜拜      拜拜
bye-bye - bye-bye

386
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:19,938
跟近一点
keep closer

387
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,566
行了，小姐我一定搞掂的
no problem if it's a girl

388
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,276
是麻甩佬呀
it's a male

389
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:25,944
麻甩佬？
a male?

390
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,697
师姐，是公事还是私事呀？
Madam, is it official or private?

391
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,158
无论是公事还是私事也好
In any case, tell me

392
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,368
试过他的身手之后一定要回来告诉我
after you've tested him out

393
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,995
快点，不然追不上了
hurry up before it's too late

394
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,050
辗死他，辗死他
Kill him, kill him!

395
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,188
有没有搞错？叫这么多人来打人？
Trying to outnumber him?

396
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,362
师兄，不用这么重手呀
Brother, not so hard

397
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,116
你看清楚才打好吗？自己人呀
stop! A friend

398
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,159
自己人？
a friend?

399
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,206
不要动
Stop!

400
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,751
警察呀，走吧
Police! Run!

401
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,215
不要走，不要走
Stop, don't run

402
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,383
你走？
are you running?

403
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,884
不用追了
They're only

404
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,303
这班人只是人家出钱他们出命的
hired hitmen

405
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,348
兄弟，你做过什么阴功事
did you offend

406
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,724
弄到成班人追斩你
someone to get his?

407
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,060
甚至我的鬼婆上司都正在调查你
Even my foreign lady
superior is probing you

408
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,269
查我？
is she?

409
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,355
你上司是谁？
Who's your superior?

410
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,065
讲起她真是了不起
She's really outstanding

411
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,443
最近卫成被杀那案件都是由她负责的
she's in charge of wei Cheng's murder case

412
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,028
这案件我也有份的
I'm also working on the same case

413
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,238
你有份？
are you?

414
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,075
检控官
Prosecutor

415
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,285
有什么需要帮忙的话，随时打电话给我
if you need any help, just call me

416
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,245
好呀
okay

417
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,579
拜拜
bye-bye

418
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,792
糟了，忘记了打他一顿
bad, I forgot to beat him up

419
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,794
回去怎么向鬼婆交代呢？
how am I to report back?

420
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,798
还被人打到周身肿，一定会被爸爸责骂了
I may get the hell from daddy

421
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,680
爸爸，轻力一点
daddy, lighter

422
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,348
轻力一点不能散瘀的
I must do it hard to cure you

423
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,710
知你瘀就瘀了，但不知你瘀得这么犀利
I didn't know you were so badly bruised

424
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,311
来吧，来吧
come on

425
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,771
不要胡搞呀
don't foul up things

426
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,942
觉得痛呢，以后不要那么冲动
next time don't be so impulsive

427
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,902
不要随便跟人打架
don't fight anymore

428
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,448
爸爸，是MADAM大力压下来嘛
daddy, madam is pressing hard

429
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,616
臭蛋，苹果
bad egg, apple

430
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,287
拿回来，拿回来
get it back

431
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,998
你什么时候才成人呀？
you never grow up

432
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,040
不好意思
sorry

433
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,003
成人？爸爸，你也到退休的时候了
daddy, it's time for your to retire

434
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,088
退休？你养我吗？
retire? Are you going to support me?

435
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,259
臭蛋，这个问题可大可小，不要随便乱答
It's a serious question.
Think before you answer

436
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,845
儿子养爸爸，怕什么可大可小呀
what is it so serious?

437
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,222
有粥就吃粥，有饭就吃饭
We'll live for better or worse

438
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,515
爸爸，对吗？
is that right, daddy?

439
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,933
算你识讲
Yes

440
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,144
借个火用一用
lend me a fire

441
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,271
哀仔，又说戒了烟？
I thought you'd given up smoking

442
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,856
看见你吸我又心瘾起了
only because you've turned me on

443
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,901
这么多心瘾，又不见你有向上爬的瘾？
why don't you work yourself up?

444
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,527
整天吊儿郎当
Why are you always loitering around?

445
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,780
爸爸，我整天都以汪警司为目标的
I've set my mind on a police superintendent

446
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,741
那你的目标太高了
don't set too high a standard

447
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,702
以你的资历怎样去做警司呀？
you don't qualify for it

448
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,122
知子莫若父
like fater, like son

449
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,916
仆街仔
you're incorrigible

450
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,753
喝杯酒吧
have a drink

451
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,257
每一个人都要对自己所做的事负责
one must be responsible for what one does

452
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,302
做人要清醒一点
be sober

453
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,722
多喝酒会容易令人不清醒的
drinking may be harmful

454
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,308
我现在很清醒，知道你说什么
I'm sober now. I know what you mean

455
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,812
你今天来找我，究竟想说什么
what did you want to see me for?

456
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:42,153
夏令正，你很喜欢玩火车的？
Hsia ling-Cheng, do you like trains?

457
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,029
是
Yes

458
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,782
我喜欢火车前进的大无畏姿态
I want to be dauntless

459
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,408
和我做人的原则一样
like a racing train

460
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,561
对，你应该知道
it's not

461
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,497
火车前进的第一个原则不是大无畏
dauntless

462
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:53,998
而是循规蹈矩
a train races on the right track

463
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,544
火车一旦出轨就会车毁人亡
once derailed, it kills

464
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,129
火车本身不会出路轨
a train doesn't derail by itself

465
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,674
除非有人刻意破坏
unless someone does it purposely

466
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,387
火车一旦被破坏，将会有很多人无辜受害
once destroyed, a train kills innocents

467
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,057
我的职责就是要拘捕那些破坏路轨的人
my duty is to arrest the destroyers

468
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,684
我的职责跟你一样
mine is the same.

469
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,894
如果有任何人破坏路轨
If anyone disrupts the rail,

470
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,813
我也不会袖手旁观
I won't stand by

471
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,567
维护法律的正义和公平
safeguarding justice

472
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,944
的确是一个冠冕堂皇的口号
is a beautiful slogan

473
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,446
不过我想没有人用这个口号
no one will

474
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,575
去做出一些破坏法律的事
use it to destroy

475
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,827
只要令火车安全到站
I'll do all I can to eliminate saboteurs

476
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,998
我会不顾一切尽全力去铲除破坏路轨的人
to ensure the train arrive safely

477
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,251
火车可以冲红灯
a train can't break out

478
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,878
但是不可以冲出我的手掌
of my palm

479
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,757
吃东西，吃东西
eat, eat

480
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,384
又吃东西？
again?

481
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,619
可以吃就不要浪费
Don't waste it

482
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,846
香港政府付钱，不吃就笨了
it's public money anyway

483
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,685
你吃尽管吃，师姐叫我们看守着这个人的
madam told us to watch this man

484
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,437
你千万不要背黑Z
don't ever get into trouble

485
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,063
背黑镬？
get into trouble?

486
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,858
我守了好几个钟头了，酒席也散了
I've been here for several hours

487
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,861
人家吃鱼翅，我们捱汉堡饱
the party's over, and
we're eating hamburgers

488
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,946
吃吧
eat

489
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,706
老板，我们先走了
Boss, excuse us

490
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:29,779
有没有搞错？吃饱就睡，真没你办法
Going to bed after eating?

491
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,961
什么事？
What is it?

492
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,632
咖喱，追呀
Curry, follow them

493
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,633
快点
hurry up

494
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,246
为什么挞不着呀？
why can't it be started?

495
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,265
我不知道      下车看看
- I don't know
- Get out and have a look

496
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,770
师兄，被一个苹果塞住了
brother, it's choked by an apple

497
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,856
回去一齐背黑镬了
we must bear the blame together

498
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,339
周鼎光，我不是拿你很多钱呀
Chou ting-kuang, you didn't pay me much

499
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,799
也不少了
quite a lot

500
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,926
对你来说就小儿科
it's kiddy stuff for you

501
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,804
数簿怎么样呀？拿出来吧
how's the book? Show me

502
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,890
你发神经呀
are you out of your mind?

503
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,314
连数簿也交给你，以后我还可以出来h食
How can I get on without it?

504
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,985
我给钱你用，你的痛脚就被我揸
Because I paid you, I have something on you

505
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,989
现在卫成被人杀了，我又被人控告
now wei was killed and I got involved

506
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,952
我告诉你，如果等会儿上庭我不掂的话
if I go wrong in court

507
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,996
你不要以为可以没事了
you won't

508
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,457
我一定拖你在一起的
be free either

509
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,085
如果连你也死去呢？
what if you should die?

510
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,423
我成班兄弟等着我开饭
My men live on me

511
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,843
我肯，他们都不肯
they won't let this happen

512
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,639
周鼎光，富贵险中求
chou, nothing ventured, nothing gained

513
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,517
求不求得到就要讲实力了
you need real strength

514
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,978
现在正邪的势力都被我掌握到
now I control the good and the evil

515
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,439
没有人可以再阻止我想做的事
no one won't be in my way

516
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,398
你…
you...

517
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,443
你班兄弟在下面等着你开饭呀
Your men are waiting below

518
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,577
叫啦，大声一点叫啦
Shout! Louder!

519
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,205
救命，救命…
Help, help...

520
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,111
周鼎光，你安息了
Chou ting-kuang, may you rest in peace

521
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,707
一会儿就会在法庭相见的
He'll be in court in a minute

522
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,667
这么早到被告家里干什么呀？
why did you come to the defendant's home?

523
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,086
夏令正，你还有什么话说？
Hsia, what have you to say?

524
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,714
这个时候我说什么也没有用
It won't do any good to say anything now

525
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,343
希望你冷静一点调查清楚
please calm down an investigate it

526
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,640
我想他怎么样也不会是自杀的
I don't think it was suicide

527
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,018
夏检控官，今次你水洗也不清了
mr hsia, now you can't clean yourself

528
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,146
走
get going

529
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,464
你千万不要出蛊惑呀
Don't try any tricks

530
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,508
就算出蛊惑也逃不掉的
you can't get away anyway

531
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,052
夏令正，你今天哀梗了
Hsai ling-Cheng, you're finished for sure

532
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,675
夏令正
Hsia ling-Cheng

533
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,974
活该
Shit

534
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,327
法官大人
Your honor,

535
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,872
由于本案次被告未能依时出庭应讯
since the defendant falls to appear

536
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,834
我代表控方要求充公被告的保释金
he should be under arrest

537
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,252
同时通缉被告
with bail forfeited

538
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,714
法官大人，我要求再多等十五分钟
your honor, I ask for
the grace of 15 minutes

539
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,758
我相信我的当事人已经赶来
I believe my client will rush here

540
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,142
你们不用等了，他永远也不会来
No need to wait. He'll never turn up

541
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,018
他已经被人杀死了
he has been killed

542
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,571
法庭之内不得宣哗
Silence in court!

543
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,697
你是什么人？
Who are you?

544
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,784
法官大人，我是重案组的高级督察施丽宜
I'm senior inspector shih li-yi of cid

545
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,538
希望法官大人批准我当庭拘捕
please Grant me permission, your honor

546
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:21,542
杀死周鼎光的疑凶夏令正先生
to arrest mr hsia who killed chou

547
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,962
施督察，你的要求被批准
inspector shih, your request is approved

548
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,590
夏先生，请你伸出手来
mr hsia, your hands please

549
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,757
等一等
wait

550
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,512
首先你有没有充分的证据
have you sufficient evidence

551
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,514
怀疑夏先生犯法呢？
against mr hsia?

552
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,935
否则本席可以告你妨碍审讯的程序
We can prosecute you for disruption

553
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,045
藐视法庭
and contempt of court

554
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:44,523
法官大人，我亲眼看见夏先生在凶案现场
your honor, I saw mr hsia on the spot

555
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,234
夏先生并且拒捕逃走
he resisted arrest and fled

556
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,322
如果真是这样子，夏先生就有可疑了
mr hsia is a suspect then

557
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:56,452
不过施督察，你会不会认错人呢？
but inspector shih, you
must've misidentified

558
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,622
我绝对不会认错
I did not

559
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,291
你为什么可以这样肯定呢？
how could you be so sure?

560
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,045
我可以理直气壮的问夏先生一声
I may ask mr hsia frankly

561
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,506
一个钟头前你在哪里？
where were you an hour ago?

562
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,717
你答我，你在哪里？
Answer me. Where were you?

563
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,427
答不出了
You can't answer

564
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:16,722
夏先生，我现在正式拘捕你
mr hsia, you're under arrest

565
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:26,899
一个钟头前，我和夏先生共进早餐
I was having breakfast
with mr hsia an hour agon

566
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,701
法官大人
Your honor

567
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:38,702
施督察
inspector shih

568
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,414
我很欣赏你办事的干劲
I admire your efficiency

569
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,708
不过你可能认错人了
but you're mistaken

570
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,129
所以请你不要阻止审讯的进行
please don't disrupt the court

571
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:56,595
否则本席会下驱逐令，并且向你提出起诉
or you'll be expelled

572
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,397
法官大人
Your honor,

573
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,275
这件案的两个被告既然相继死去
since both defendants have died

574
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,026
我要求撤销控告
I request the charge be withdrawn

575
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,696
本案就此审结
the case is closed

576
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,739
COURT
court

577
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,861
我真不明白为什么法官会把你释放？
I don't know why your were acquitted

578
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,971
不过不要紧，他放了你
but I can shoot you to death

579
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,865
我现在也可以一枪打死你
all the same

580
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,726
要就快一点，不然交通灯一转
faster, or I'll drive away

581
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,077
我就开车走了
when the light turns

582
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,262
开车呀
Go

583
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,306
八婆，开车呀
Go, bitch

584
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,628
死八婆，路是你的吗？
bitch, don't hog the street

585
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,521
失恋呀？被男人抛弃呀？
disappointed in love? Jilted?

586
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:30,522
看什么？
Keep away

587
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,740
死八婆，你以为有枪就了不起呀
Bitch, a gun is not everything

588
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,707
开门，开门，有人追斩我
Open up! I'm being pursed

589
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,917
快点开门
open up

590
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:50,959
开门
open up

591
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,670
什么事？      先让我进去
- what is it?
- Let me get in first

592
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,673
不要乱开门，有人追斩我
don't open the door. I'm being pursued

593
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,384
文仔，干什么？      MISS
- wen, what is it?
- Miss

594
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,219
有人追杀我，你替我顶住先
resist for me, please

595
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:01,762
什么事情？
what happen?

596
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,743
余志文，你干什么呀？
Yu chi-wen, what are you doing?

597
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,747
MISS，这里真好环境
Miss, you're okay

598
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,500
早知我也多读书去做检控管了
I should've become a prosecutor myself

599
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,085
你怎样知道我住在这里？
how do you know I live here?

600
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,380
阿SIR，蛇有蛇路，鼠有鼠路
I have my eyes and ears, sir

601
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,550
香港有多大呀，要找一个人很容易
Hong Kong is only a tiny place

602
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,511
何况以你阿SIR的身份，找不到你？
any you're a man of status

603
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,096
昨天也遇见你啦
I saw you yesterday

604
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,682
你昨天看见什么      你昨天见过他吗
- what did you see yesterday?
- Did you see him yesterday?

605
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,852
你不用紧张，我不是说他
Don't get excited, I didn't mean that

606
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,854
我在说昨天我去找朋友
I mean when I arrived,

607
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,440
到达的时候他已经死了
he was dead

608
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,775
那我看见了就急急忙忙的走了
then I rush out

609
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,529
说时迟，那时快，突然间有枝枪…
suddenly, a gun...

610
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,823
枪指向额上
Pointed at my temple

611
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,492
我当然好汉不吃眼前亏
so I hastily...

612
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,494
一个擒拿手…
Grasped his hand...

613
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,038
扔掉他的枪
And flung away his gun

614
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,207
你说你没有杀人，谁人杀人你看不看见？
did you see the killer?

615
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,542
我就看不见
No, but that kid

616
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,503
不过下的臭小子应该看见的
under the table did

617
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:20,257
如果我找他出来做证，那就沉冤得雪了
with him as witness, the
record can be cleared

618
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,468
不过他不肯白白出来做证
but he won't agree to appear as witness

619
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,095
他还要照顾一个瘫了的阿爷
he has to look after a crippled grandpa

620
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,016
今天是我和女朋友相识两周年纪念
it's inconvenient to talk now

621
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:30,684
有什么事改天再谈吧
let's talk some other day

622
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:36,356
对，对，我没理由这么不识相
right, I should have thought about it

623
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,527
你这么识相，就拿去好了
take this

624
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,733
CID，站着
Cid, stop!

625
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:55,793
别跑
Stay there!

626
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:01,757
臭小子，听到CID就走，好人有限

627
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,134
贼人也常常说自己是CID
Even a thug calls himself 'police'

628
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,803
看清楚我是不是CID？
look at my identification paper

629
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,932
你的样子像贼多一点
you look more like a villain

630
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,185
说我的样子像贼，面向墙，靠墙呀
face the wall, lean against it

631
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,482
这一千在哪里得来的？
where did you get this?

632
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,717
是我的朋友夏检控官给我的
My friend prosecutor hsia gave it to me

633
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,153
是吗？他为什么要给钱你呀？
did he? Why did he give you money?

634
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,532
什么？不一定要你说
You may choose to speak

635
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,367
回警察局才说吧，走
at the station

636
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,955
你再认清楚一点，杀人的凶手是不是他？
look closely. Is he the killer?

637
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,625
阿姐，我对你说了很多次，是白狗呀
I said many times it was somebody else

638
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:40,045
黑狗偷食，白狗当灾的白狗呀
but he was framed

639
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,714
臭小子，你不要再耍阿姐了
how dare you tease me, kid?

640
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:43,674
MADAM
Madam

641
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,176
不关你事，继续写口供
not your concern. Take the statement

642
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,721
你不要跟我说什么黑狗白狗
stop making fool of me, kid

643
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,224
我告诉你，我不理你说什么狗
just take a close look

644
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,684
你最好认清楚一点
is he

645
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,353
当时杀人的到底是不是他？
the killer?

646
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,274
阿姐，你这样子，叫我怎么样认人呀？
How can I identify this way?

647
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,151
那是不是容易认一点呀？
Is this better?

648
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,737
阿姐，你这么恶干什么呀？
Sister, what are you doing?

649
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,407
我认出是人情，认不出是道理
I have no obligation to identity

650
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,367
我不是生出来认人的
it's not my duty to identify

651
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,246
你们要是再串的话我就向投诉组投诉
no more nonsense. Or I go to complaints

652
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,414
不用在这里受气
instead of getting the hell from you

653
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,915
臭小子
bastard

654
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,137
起来
Stand up

655
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,058
施督察，对付小孩子用不着这样套取资料
inspector shih, that's
no way to treat a child

656
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,605
这小子到过现场，我猜他看见夏令正杀人
he was one the spot, I
guess he saw the killer

657
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,440
是吗？
did he?

658
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,317
小朋友，跟我来
Little friend, follow me

659
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:44,484
你想怎么样？
what do you want?

660
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,237
不要紧张，跟你聊聊
Take it easy. I only want to have a talk

661
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,782
这里是警察局，只要你合作，没事的
if you co-operate, you'll be alright

662
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,628
小子，拿了成人身份证没有？
Kid, have you got an adult I/d card?

663
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:03,837
没有
No

664
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,882
那么醒目一定有命拿的
You'll live to get one if you're smart

665
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,845
这里是警察局，你不要乱来
this is police! Don't try anything!

666
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,555
他给你多少钱这样做呀？
How much did he pay you to do that?

667
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,891
我这样做不是为了钱
I didn't do it for money

668
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,310
没有好处你都肯做？
without money?

669
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,729
我只是为了义气
I did it out of justice

670
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,191
义气值多少钱一斤呀？
what price is your justice?

671
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,568
说出来听听
Tell me

672
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,614
你想放钱在我的袋里，我没理由拒绝的
I have no reason to turn down your gift

673
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:33,867
醒目
you're smart

674
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,955
小子，我像你这么大也没有你这么醒目
I wasn't that smart when I was your age

675
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,332
不用把高帽子给我戴了
apple-polishing

676
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,542
高帽子没有大用的
can't sell

677
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,712
对，讲得有道理
right you are

678
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,715
我这个人很有义气
I'm a man of righteousness

679
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,427
受人钱财替人消灾，那你怎样看法呀？
whatever I take I'll pay you back in kind

680
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,889
好，那义气值多少钱？
well, how much do you want?

681
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:02,646
不用口震的，尽量说吧
Just name it

682
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,273
一百万
one million

683
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:09,277
这么狮子大开口，当心啃死呀
aren't your afraid of getting choked

684
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,905
可以吃就不要浪费是我做人的宗旨
I have good digestion,
I can stomach anything

685
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,909
阿SIR，是不是可以立刻拘捕夏令正呀？
can you arrest hsia ling-Cheng, sir?

686
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,704
小朋友，对MADAM说声对不起
Little friend, say sorry to madam

687
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:25,544
MADAM，对不起，我不对，我乱说话
sorry, madam

688
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,379
我想搏取奖金嘛
I wanted to get a reward

689
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,423
我要告你报假案

690
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,675
我还未成年的
I'm not yet of age

691
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,635
我可以告你说谎的
I can sue you for lying

692
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,721
说谎有罪的吗？
is lying guilty?

693
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:37,764
臭小子      施督察
Bastard - inspector shih

694
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,016
小子，走吧
go now, kid

695
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,520
MADAM，我先走了
excuse me, madam

696
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,481
仙蒂，我们有很多工作要做的
Cindy, we've lots of things to do

697
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,483
小孩子报假案的事小儿科啦
let's not waste time

698
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,818
无谓浪费人力物力
on this

699
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,236
你回去工作吧
go back to work

700
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,953
臭蛋，快点去跟着这个小子
Bad egg, follow this kid

701
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:03,373
MADAM，我这份口供还未落完呀
madam, I haven't finished
taking the statement

702
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,375
你写了这么久，你写了什么呀？
what have you taken down?

703
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:10,881
黑狗偷吃，白狗当灾，灾字我不会写
I don't know how to write this word

704
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,699
你有没有搞错，灾字也不会写
you don't know who to write "framed"

705
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,301
你一定是没有当过灾
you must have never been framed

706
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,222
上边是水，下面是火，水火成灾
this

707
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,474
这样子也不会
will do

708
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,797
去跟着这个小子，不要甩拖呀
Follow this kid now

709
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:27,856
YES MADAM
yes, madam

710
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,358
太保，替我搞掂它
fix it

711
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,110
我去跟踪那个小子
I'll follow that kid

712
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,656
小心呀，衰仔，又被师姐骂了？
did you get the hell from madam again?

713
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,950
爸爸，不要骂骂声
Don't say that, daddy

714
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,185
师姐委以重任
I got an important

715
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,454
叫我跟踪那个小子，不简单的
mission from her

716
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,164
那就落足眼力，不要让他走甩
be smart, don't let him get away

717
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,524
行了，我跟踪，你放心
you may count on me

718
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,375
吃鸡脾吧，给包烟我吸吧
take this drumstick.
Give me a packet of cigarettes

719
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,195
衰仔，烟吸得多没有益的
smoking is bad for health

720
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,421
就这样子吧
that's all

721
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,714
对不起，师姐
sorry, madam

722
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,924
不好意思
sorry

723
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,675
爸爸，我先走了
daddy, excuse me

724
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,094
赶着去投贻吗？
rushing to hell?

725
00:59:59,095 --> 00:59:59,971
讲错说话
Damn, I shouldn't have said that

726
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,419
给我捉到就要你的命
I'll kill you if I see you again

727
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,049
阿爷，我回来了
grandpa, I'm back

728
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,725
阿爷，我回来了
Grandpa, I'm back

729
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,687
阿爷，开门啦
grandpa, open up

730
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:50,730
我回来了
I'm back

731
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:54,568
阿爷
grandpa

732
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:00,991
阿爷
Grandpa

733
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,204
阿SIR，你算怎么样？我和你已说好了
sir, why are you backing out?

734
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,581
你快放开我的爷爷
Let my grandpa go

735
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:12,903
你再不放开我阿爷
free him,

736
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,212
我把你的丑事全爆出来
or I'll blow the lid off your scandal

737
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,050
阿爷，阿爷，你不用怕
grandpa, don't be afraid

738
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,011
阿爷
grandpa

739
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,983
阿SIR，你想杀人灭口就杀我好了
Kill me, sir, if you want to

740
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,278
我爷爷什么也不知道，他是个哑巴
he knows nothing. He's mute

741
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,158
杀我啦，你杀我爷爷没用的
killing him won't do you any good

742
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,369
是我看见你杀人，不是我爷爷看见你杀人
he didn't see the killer, I did

743
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,627
阿爷
Grandpa

744
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,091
阿爷
Grandpa

745
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:01,760
我跟你拼命
I'll fight with you

746
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,445
汪SIR，我想不到是你
Mr wang, so it's you

747
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:23,406
你干什么？
what are you doing?

748
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,450
汪SIR，你放了他吧
Mr wang, release him

749
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,787
你不要乱来
don't do anything foolish

750
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,789
把枪放下
put down your gun

751
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,794
把枪放下
put down your gun

752
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,524
文仔，快点走
Wen, run

753
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,839
大声公，我跟你捉几盘棋
Let's play chess

754
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,816
什么料呀？叫我到荒山野岭来
Some cheek! Why bring me here?

755
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,320
柴爷      柴爷
Mr tsai - mr tsai

756
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,198
柴爷      柴爷
mr tsai - mr tsai

757
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,768
怎么样子呀？干什么呀？
what do you want? What are you doing?

758
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:50,827
柴爷
Mr tsai

759
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:54,497
干什么？有说就说，不明白就问
speak up. Ask if your don't understand

760
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,207
不然留下我们的老家伙在这里干什么呀？
why let us old fellows stay here?

761
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,901
早就可以退休了，对吗？
We should have retired, right?

762
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,502
你真的要进去？柴爷
Are you sure you want to get in?

763
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,962
我看不需要了吧
Don't get in

764
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,590
神神秘秘干什么？
why are you acting sneakily?

765
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,761
那就是白头人送黑头人
An old man attending a young one's funeral

766
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,971
一会儿怎样对他说呀？
how are we to comfort him?

767
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:12,432
什么呀？千万不要说废话
Don't talk such nonsense as

768
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,393
什么节哀顺变，人死不能复生
don't be sad, etc

769
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,313
这些都是多余的，只会令人心烦
this is superfluous

770
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,816
我什么也不会，只是会说这几句嘛
I don't have anything better in mind

771
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,443
来了
coming

772
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,822
整天不停的嚷着叫我退休
you kept telling me to retire

773
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,658
幸好我不听你说
luckily I did not

774
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,328
不然谁养我呀？
or no one would support me

775
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,791
牛高马大，结果比我先去
you were strong, but died young

776
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,710
不要伤心了
don't be sad

777
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:46,841
节哀顺变啦，柴爷
don't overgrieve, mr tsai

778
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:50,470
人死不能复生，什么都是天意的
you can't go against heaven's will

779
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:54,933
谢谢汪SIR
thank you, mr wang

780
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,937
阿蛋这个人平时做事是糊里糊涂点
he normally muddled through

781
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,272
不过他很有上进心
but he was ambitious

782
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,692
汪SIR，他时时都找你来做目标的
mr wang, he always followed you as model

783
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,780
我知道，你不说我都知道
I know

784
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,032
他是一个好警察
he was a good policeman

785
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,827
你们俩仔爷都是好警察
both you and he are

786
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,748
每一个好警察都应该知道邪不能胜正
every policeman should know evil
can't conquer good

787
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,085
胜利永远属于正义的一方
justice always wins

788
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,294
我知道
I know

789
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,505
不要再哭了
don't cry anymore

790
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:26,881
我不哭
I won't

791
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:33,096
我不哭，我不哭
I won't cry

792
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,778
叫你穿上袜子的
I told you to wear socks

793
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,493
爸爸不是太反对你吸烟的
I didn't object to your smoking

794
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,098
后面有他的地址，干掉他
The other side has his address.
Finish him off

795
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,564
喂，喂
Hello, hello

796
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,245
来吧
Come on

797
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:28,748
来吧
come on

798
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,794
来吧
come on

799
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:38,508
来吧
come on

800
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,835
喂，请汪精卫警司
Hello, police superintendent wang, please?

801
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,002
我是，谁呀？
Yes, speaking. Who's it calling?

802
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,587
律政署的夏令正
Hsia ling-Cheng of justice department

803
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,172
有人来我家想杀我
someone tried to kill me at my home

804
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,133
真的？现在情况怎么样？
how's it now?

805
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,343
杀我的人死在我的家中
My killer died at my home

806
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,595
请你不要移动现场任何东西
please don't move anything from the spot

807
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,391
还有，他可能是杀死梁二胜全家的凶手
he may be the killer of the liang family

808
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:29,267
我立刻赶来
I'll come right away

809
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,810
好，我等你
okay, I'll wait for you

810
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,147
你不要相信他，他是杀人凶手
don't believe him, he's the killer

811
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,815
你说什么？谁是杀人凶手？
what? Who's the killer?

812
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,985
汪警司，刚才和你通电话的江警司
Sir, he just had telephone
conversation with you

813
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:39,861
他杀人？
did he kill?

814
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:40,803
他杀什么人？
Whom did he kill?

815
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,029
我看见他杀了周鼎光
He killed chou ting-kuang

816
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,531
还想杀我灭口
and tried to kill me to
destroy the evidence

817
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,390
你说的是真话？
are you speaking the truth?

818
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,117
为什么你也不相信我？
Why don't you believe me?

819
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,704
不是为了你的清白，昨天我就不会来找你
I came yesterday to prove your innocence

820
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,105
如果我不是在警察局里
I told that foreign lady

821
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,582
对鬼婆说你没有杀人
you didn't kill

822
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,294
汪精卫怎么知道我看见他杀人呀
so wang knows I saw him kill

823
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,590
就是因为这样子，他要杀你灭口？
is that why he tried to
kill to destroy evidence?

824
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,301
还有，他杀死了我爷爷
And he killed my grandpa

825
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:08,473
是我累死了我爷爷
I got my grandpa involved

826
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,350
阿爷，阿爷…
grandpa, grandpa...

827
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,937
糟了，我还打了电话给他
Bad, I even called him

828
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,691
这里很危险，我们快点走
it's dangerous here. Let's get out at once

829
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,202
你两个不要动
Stand there

830
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:30,578
原来是你
so it's you

831
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,538
是不是汪精卫派你来杀我们的？
did wang send you to kill us?

832
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,664
没有人派我来
No one did

833
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,460
如果我可以杀你，我已经一枪打死你了
I could've gunned you down if I wanted to

834
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,962
夏令正，杀人填命
hsia, you are linked with

835
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,006
你杀了臭蛋和小孩子爷爷
the death of bad egg

836
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,091
你是永远走不掉的
and that child of grandpa

837
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,761
你说是我杀死他们？
you accuse me of killing them?

838
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,180
不是，我爷爷不是他杀死的
No, he didn't kill my grandpa

839
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:50,581
阿SIR也不是他杀死的
he didn't kill the cop either

840
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,849
是哀警司杀的
that damn police superintendent did

841
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,519
你不要过来，不然一枪打死你
keep away, or you'll die

842
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,145
你不要乱来      别动
- don't do anything foolish
- Stay where you are

843
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,481
这个手铐你应该会用的
you know how to use the handcuffs

844
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,319
将你和小孩子锁在一起
handcuff yourself and that child

845
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,532
如果有什么蛊惑，我绝对不会客气
if you try anything, I'll be nasty

846
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,619
文仔，不用怕，我们跟她回警察局
don't be afraid. Come
with her to the police

847
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,062
不会有事的
you're going to be alright

848
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,331
我不去，你们警察没有一个是好人
no, I won't. There's not one good policeman

849
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,165
别走
stay

850
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:23,923
他只不过是个子孩子，你也不放过他？
he's only a child. Let him go

851
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:37,728
进来
Come in

852
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,314
汪SIR，夏先生要见你
mr wang, mr hsia wants to see you

853
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:41,966
叫他进来
show him in

854
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:42,733
YES，SIR
yes, sir

855
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,485
夏先生，请
mr hsia, please

856
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,533
你好，夏检控官
hello, mr hsia

857
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,038
对不起，我不知道你戴上了手铐
sorry, I didn't know you were handcuffed

858
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:57,790
YES，SIR
yes, sir

859
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,130
你想见我，不知道有什么事？
why do you want to see me?

860
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:08,217
我想看看人和禽兽有什么分别？
What's the difference
between a man and a beast?

861
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,680
我也正在这里看着
I was watching here

862
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,059
其实真的没有什么分别
there's not much difference

863
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:20,479
一样有眼有耳有口有鼻
both have eyes, ears and nose

864
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,191
有分别，禽兽通常多了一条尾巴
but a beast has a tail too

865
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,152
而且迟早也会露出来
and will show it sooner or later

866
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:31,741
对，对，可惜有尾没有尾
right,

867
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,493
在法律上人人是平等的
but they're equal in law

868
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,581
好像杀人那样，无论杀人是好人还是坏人
a killer is the same,
whether he's good or bad

869
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,417
又无论被杀的是好人还是坏人
and whether the one he kills is good or not

870
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,878
总之一慨叫做杀人
he's called a killer at the same

871
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:48,382
杀人者，迟早都好像阁下一样戴上手铐
a killer will be handcuffed like you

872
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,635
你明白就最好了，汪警司
glad you understand police
superintendent wang

873
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:52,553
就算我戴上手铐
even in handcuffs,

874
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,972
都一样可以对付你这些禽兽
I can deal with you beasts

875
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:59,977
我明白，我早就明白，其你贵为检控官
I understand. As a prosecutor

876
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,730
在法庭上说一声就可以险暴安良
you can stand for justice in court

877
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:04,857
又何必扮成执法先锋
why take the risk

878
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,401
冲锋陷阵，很危险的
to go to the front?

879
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,155
相信法律，对法律有点信心吧
Have confidence in law

880
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:16,369
记住，邪永远不能胜正的
remember, evil can't conquer good

881
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,209
小子，这么喜欢做猎人
you enjoy being a hunter

882
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,127
去森林打雀鸟吧
shoot the birds

883
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:29,256
想打虎？几时干到你呀
you can never be a tiger-killer

884
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,161
阿SIR，我们控不控告他呀？
are we going to prosecute him, sir?

885
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,846
汪SIR，一线
Mr wang, line one

886
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:37,348
先听电话
take it first

887
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:39,725
喂
hello

888
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,587
汪警司，你最近做了那么多好事
how are you doing

889
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,021
身体怎么样呀？
after doing what you did?

890
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,108
怎么样呀？阿庄，很久没见
It's you John. It's been a long time

891
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:49,276
那么快就记不得我没关系
remember

892
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:51,445
记得那本数簿就行了
that book

893
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,197
我给钱你用
it records the money

894
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,449
你的痛脚就被我揸的那本数簿呢
I pay you

895
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,201
没理由的
impossible

896
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,829
你知道数簿在哪里吗？
you know where that book is?

897
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,372
你有什么好提议？
What do you suggest?

898
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,042
钱，不要还价，不要出蛊惑
Money. No bargaining and no monkey business

899
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,920
一百万，今天下午海滨公园见
$1 million
see you at the harbor park this afternoon

900
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,172
好，依你的意思
okay, agreed

901
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,300
先扣留他四十八小时
detain him for 48 hours

902
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:14,201
你尽量搜集资料去控告他
get evidence

903
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,011
没法可想的话才放他
don't release him unless necessary

904
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,037
YES，SIR
yes, sir

905
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,638
施督察，二线
line two, inspector shih

906
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,392
男朋友找到这里了
your boyfriend is here

907
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,351
谢谢
thank you

908
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:23,602
喂
hello

909
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,106
鬼婆，我有办法证明夏令正是清白的
madam, I can prove hsia's innocent

910
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,608
我今天约了你的警司给掩口费
I've an appointment with your police supt

911
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,611
你千万不要告诉他我打电话给你
don't tell him I called you

912
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,239
好，反正我很久也没有看过电影
okay, I haven't seen a show for a long time

913
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,033
那就海滨公园见
see you at the horbor park

914
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:53,382
嘉莲，现在这个子子在你左手边
Karen, he's on your left side

915
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:54,842
他戴着太阳眼镜
he wears sunglasses

916
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:58,679
听WALKMAN，穿着蓝色飞机恤粉红色袖
he's listening to walkman,
in jacket with pink sleeves

917
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,767
我看见了，老板
I've seen him now, boss

918
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,728
这小子很蛊惑的，小心一点
he's crafty. Be alert

919
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:09,023
放心，我不会令你失望的
don't worry. I won't let you down

920
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,233
好，祝你好运
good luck

921
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,310
趴下
Crouch down

922
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:35,776
别走
Stop

923
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:38,529
别走
stop

924
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:56,839
趴下
Crouch down

925
01:20:58,687 --> 01:20:59,563
文仔怎么样？
How's wen?

926
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,190
你自己看看
See for yourself

927
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:17,039
问他，你大声一点问他
Talk to him loudly

928
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,750
他或者会答你
he may answer you

929
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,294
他会告诉你
he'll tell you

930
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,923
这个社会是没有法律的
there's no law in this society

931
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,468
这个世界是没有正义的
there's no justice in this world

932
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:36,475
我们这班执法者是不值得他们信赖的
we law enforcers can't be relied on

933
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:38,727
你…
you...

934
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,939
一向以为自己大公无私
Consider yourself disinterested

935
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:43,816
我问你
listen

936
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:50,406
文仔的死你说由谁去负起这个责任
who's responsible for wen's death?

937
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:53,784
夏令正，你不用这么大声
Hsia ling-Cheng, not so loud

938
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,538
文仔的死，其实你和我一样都是很难过
both you and I feel sorry for him

939
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,499
我会搜集证据缉拿凶手归案
I'll gather evidence to bring
the criminal to justice

940
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:01,875
证据？
evidence?

941
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,129
文仔已经死了，这些算不算证据？
Wen's dead, is this not evidence?

942
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:08,215
如果等有证据才去对付汪精卫
How many more will die before

943
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,175
不知道会死多少人了？
we get evidence against wang ching-sei

944
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,679
我告诉你，我们的法律
our law is not to help

945
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:17,724
不是要来伸张正义除暴安良
seeking justice

946
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,728
而是来保护那些杀人不眨眼的杀人凶手
but to protect the cold-blooded killers

947
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,397
你知不知道？
do you know that?

948
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:28,443
夏令正，我告诉你，我比你更加疾恶如仇
Hsia, I ate crime more than you do

949
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:31,530
你以暴易暴的方法我都会做
I can fight violence with violence

950
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:33,615
而且我会比你做得更加彻底
and I can do it better

951
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:35,075
你等着瞧
just wait and see

952
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,405
汪精卫
Wang ching-wel

953
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,704
你不用躲了，出来
no more hiding, come out

954
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,210
出来，我找你呀，汪精卫
come out to face me, wang ching-wel

955
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,378
我知道你在这里
I know you are here

956
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,340
出来见我
come out to face me

957
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,844
你们听不到我讲话吗？你们是聋的哑的？
you heard me? Are you deaf and dumb?

958
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,936
汪精卫，你恶贯满盈
You've come to the end of your evil road

959
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,612
你老实对我说，汪精卫有没有到来？
Tell me frankly, is wang here?

960
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,118
带我去见他，走
Take me to see him

961
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,947
你迫我出来对你有什么好处呢？
It doesn't pay you to have forced me out

962
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:22,701
汪精卫，我不会放过你
wang, I won't let you go

963
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,246
这句话应该由我来说才对
I should say this myself

964
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,293
学人做英雄？
want to be a hero?

965
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:34,588
我告诉你，这个世界是很残酷的
Listen, this world is cruel

966
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,049
做英雄的收场就是这样子
a hero ends up like this

967
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,346
你连一个那么忠心，处处维护你的手下
You even killed a female assistant

968
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,515
你都竟然忍心下手杀死她？
who had been loyal to you

969
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,559
没有，我没有下手杀死她
I didn't kill her

970
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,853
你验验凶器有没有我的手指模？
the weapon doesn't contain my fingerprints

971
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,855
你调查看看有没有人证？
see if there's any witness

972
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:35,857
我还可以告诉你
I was having breakfast

973
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,442
我刚刚才跟法官一起吃过早餐
with the judge

974
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:39,111
来到看见她就已经这样子
she was lying there when I arrived

975
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,822
我想她是自杀的
she must have killed herself

976
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,784
这种谎话你也说得出
what kind of a lie is that?

977
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,080
这里不是法庭，无谓多讲
This is not the court. Don't argue here

978
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,248
夏检控官
prosecutor hsia

979
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,128
你和我一样都是杀人犯
we're both killers

980
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,881
只不过你当自己是替天行道，儆恶惩奸
you invoke the name of justice

981
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,342
而我就滥杀无辜，杀人灭口
while branding me as wanton killer

982
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:05,178
其实无论用什么藉口杀人也好
whatever the excuse for killing

983
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:08,306
依法论法，杀人者死，结果都是一样
the killer should be
held accountable before

984
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:11,435
不过今天没有人审判我们
but, no judge is trying either of us

985
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,104
是我们两个互相解决
we're talking the law into our own hands
