00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:13,596
because you know

189
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:14,971
you're never going to get married.

190
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,094
Uh, and that would be a
bad thing because...?

191
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,094
You don't get a warm body to
lay next to every night,

192
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,219
someone to have kids with.

193
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,425
Yeah.

194
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,343
Fred, your kids sleep with
you and Susan every night.

195
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,092
You are sleep-deprived and going crazy.

196
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,841
A wife is someone to grow old with,

197
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:28,841
someone to witness

198
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,923
the miracles of life with.

199
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,257
-Right?-Mm-hmm.

200
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:33,340
Vince, there are three things in life

201
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,714
that require a witness...

202
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,130
crimes, accidents,

203
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,797
and marriages.

204
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:38,713
Need I say more?

205
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,004
[friends chortle]

206
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,419
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

207
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,419
Yeah!

208
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,335
Hey, pal,

209
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,168
we married guys are actually
living the dream.

210
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,168
Yeah.

211
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,292
The only thing your wives dream about

212
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,708
is you guys actually doing the dishes.

213
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,583
[chuckling]

214
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,583
Besides...

215
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,123
if I want to marry, I can get married.

216
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,121
Oh!

217
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,996
Look, Damon,

218
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,245
I'm not denying you date a lot of women.

219
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,578
You're just not a guy girls want to marry.

220
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,743
You serious?

221
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,244
Very. Gineen feels the same way.

222
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,284
Okay, well, Gineen has never liked me.

223
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,243
Fred? What about Susan?
What does she say about me?

224
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:16,825
I don't know. That you're fun?

225
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:17,991
See?

226
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,616
But she wouldn't set you
up with any of her friends.

227
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,532
Oh!

228
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:21,949
See?

229
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,156
Face it, Damon. You're that cool bachelor.

230
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:26,531
Women can sense when a guy can't commit,

231
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,780
which is why you will never get a girl

232
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,069
to say "I do."

233
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,945
Oh, I could, if I wanted to.

234
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:33,986
Want to bet?

235
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:35,568
[laughs]

236
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:39,234
Tell you what...

237
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,233
you find a girl, any girl,

238
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,316
and get her to say yes to your proposal

239
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,982
by the end of the month,

240
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:46,856
I will give you

241
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,481
the Juicy Cola account...

242
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,396
all the perks, all the parties.

243
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,188
If you lose...

244
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,812
you get Bran Buddies.

245
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,727
Juicy's my account.

246
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,686
And I'm the boss. What do you say, Damon?

247
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,142
No. No.It's crazy.

248
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,974
Well, you've already lost one bet tonight,

249
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:09,556
although I've never seen
you walk away from one.

250
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:10,641
Come on, man,

251
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,181
the end of the month, that's 30 days away.

252
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:13,389
What? You can't make it happen?

253
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:14,764
I mean, that's what we're
talking about here.

254
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:15,722
Right, guys?

255
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:18,304
Yeah, but Juicy's my account.

256
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,553
Come on, buddy.

257
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:21,803
Do it.

258
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,218
One month.

259
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,177
Fine. It's a bet.

260
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:28,301
Let's bowl!

261
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:29,759
Let's do this!

262
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:42,879
Hey, Rob.

263
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,046
Hey.

264
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:45,086
Do you need help?

265
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,961
No. No, I'm good.

266
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,503
What brings you here, Mel?

267
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:52,375
Rob, I am so, so sorry.

268
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:55,042
I should have talked to
you when I was feeling unsure.

269
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,791
It's just that I thought that...

270
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,540
maybe things would change, you know?

271
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:00,872
Grow, like a weed...

272
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:01,915
I mean, a flower,

273
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,997
'cause you are definitely not a weed.

274
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,121
You're a...

275
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:08,454
a big, strong flower.

276
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,412
A rose with thorns...

277
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:13,535
not hurtful thorns.

278
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:14,702
Manly.

279
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:17,200
Resilient, like a perennial.

280
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,366
Exactly,

281
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,991
which is why I know that
you're going to be okay.

282
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,908
You know what's great about perennials?

283
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,198
They never give up.

284
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,947
They keep pushing through, every spring,

285
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,572
and I'm not giving up either.

286
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,946
Rob, I don't think it's going to happen.

287
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,070
You don't know that.

288
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:35,153
I mean, you said so yourself.
You're unsure.

289
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,111
I was unsure,

290
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:40,401
but now I'm pretty sure.

291
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,442
Look...

292
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:47,025
I know you have your fears,

293
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:49,607
but just hang onto the ring.

294
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:50,732
Just trust me.

295
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:52,148
You'll figure out we're
meant to be together.

296
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,188
'Kay.

297
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:03,977
[Damon]: You want to
change the way people think

298
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:04,935
about dental work

299
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:07,601
and we want your brand to reflect that.

300
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:10,683
So when people see this sign...

301
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,682
they don't cringe...

302
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:14,931
they smile.

303
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,096
I don't know how you made root canals cool,

304
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:22,054
but you did.

305
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:23,137
Heck, I want one.

306
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,345
I'm just glad I stayed awake.

307
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:26,678
They gave me nothing! No feedback!

308
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,927
That was a total snooze-fest.

309
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,093
[applause, Fred laughing]

310
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:30,508
Yes!

311
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:33,341
Life is bolder with Juicy Soda...

312
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:34,800
which is my account.

313
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,424
We nailed it! Mm.

314
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,589
So, Casanova,

315
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,172
did you find the girl?

316
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:45,005
Not yet.

317
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,503
What about Fiona?

318
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,170
Come on, man,

319
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,461
I'm 10 years older than her last boyfriend.

320
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,501
Maybe you'll get lucky
tonight at the J-oomph launch.

321
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,334
Oh, yes...

322
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,126
a room full of granolas and juice heads.

323
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,542
Should be lots to pick from.

324
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,207
You kept the ring?

325
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,248
I tried giving it back,
but he was all, like...

326
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,538
"I'm a perennial, and I'm not giving up."

327
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,496
I don't even want

328
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,662
to try to understand what that means,

329
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:11,828
but what I do know

330
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:13,662
is you need to stop saying
"yes" to these guys

331
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:14,786
because you want to save yourself

332
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,411
public embarrassment.

333
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:20,825
Jules, you don't understand.

334
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:22,824
When someone asks you to marry them,

335
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:24,950
and you have all of these eyes on you...

336
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,324
eyes that want you to say yes

337
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:27,449
because if you don't,

338
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,031
then wow, that would
be really uncomfortable...

339
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,822
it's hard to say "no".

340
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:33,446
Mel, you need to be more assertive,

341
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,113
like when you're instructing boot camps.

342
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:37,612
You never have
trouble demanding 10 more reps.

343
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:38,862
You need to see these propositions

344
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:39,778
like a boot camp.

345
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,484
You're right. I can be a sergeant.

346
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:42,485
There you go.

347
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,151
So are you going to give him back the ring?

348
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:45,526
Maybe next week.

349
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:46,942
What?

350
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:54,690
So, what's our strategy?

351
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:55,897
I was thinking about what you were saying

352
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:56,980
about tying in product

353
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:58,980
with our workout and nutrition programs.

354
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,813
Jules, that was a botched wedding rant.

355
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:01,895
We need to do something bigger.

356
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,812
This city is full of personal trainers

357
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:04,977
and nutritionists.

358
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,476
We need to find a way to
set ourselves apart,

359
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,269
and seeing as this is a launch party,

360
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,685
they're obviously trying to find

361
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:11,142
ways to get their brand out there.

362
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,517
So, let's get familiar with the products

363
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:14,807
and meet some people.

364
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:16,224
'Kay.

365
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:24,346
Hi.

366
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:27,886
May I try one of your
Green Goddesses, please?

367
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:29,386
Thank you.

368
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:32,468
Great smoothies.

369
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,343
Sorry, um... Will Peters.

370
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:36,966
I'm in advertising.

371
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,216
Melanie.

372
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:41,215
Melanie. It's a pleasure to
meet you, Melanie.

373
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,590
So, you herewith company peeps,

374
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,631
or are you here alone?

375
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,673
Actually, I came herewith my sister.

376
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:47,005
We are the company.

377
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,838
Hey, sis! My bad. I got stuck over there.

378
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,379
Don't worry, I was just keeping your
sister company, actually.

379
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,753
We were just getting acquainted.

380
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:54,919
You don't understand.

381
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:58,085
She's fragile right now,

382
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,376
getting over a broken engagement.

383
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,958
She is done...

384
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,458
dating, marriage, the whole thing.

385
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,749
[laughs]

386
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,622
Listen, it's...

387
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:09,248
been a pleasure, you ladies.

388
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:10,497
Enjoy.

389
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:13,496
See what I did there? I just shot him down.

390
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,954
Bam!

391
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,246
Bam. Got it.

392
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,161
'Kay, good,

393
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:18,786
'cause I have got some interest going.

394
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:19,952
Oh, yeah?

395
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,452
Not that kind of interest.
Some product placement.

396
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:22,868
So if I leave you, you'll be good, right?

397
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,409
I'll be so good.

398
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,325
Scout's honor.

399
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,492
Maybe you should put that ring back on.

400
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:27,492
Hey.

401
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,407
[techno music playing]

402
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:43,319
Hey, could I just get a soda?

403
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,277
Diet... no?

404
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,527
Okay, I'll just not drink this.

405
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,859
I just found your future bride-to-be.

406
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,192
Yeah?

407
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:52,940
So why aren't you hitting on her?

408
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,941
Fine, I struck out.

409
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:54,899
[laughs]

410
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:55,857
Then I like her already.

411
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,773
I think you'll like her a lot.

412
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:58,939
One in the red.

413
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:01,022
Oh yeah, you're right.

414
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:01,938
She's cute.

415
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,355
So do we have a contender?

416
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,187
Sure. Why not?

417
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,603
She's the one.

418
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,226
I know, right?

419
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:15,767
This stuff would work better as fertilizer.

420
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:18,016
I won't tell anyone.

421
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,306
So if you're not a fan
of all this good stuff,

422
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,097
what's keeping you here?

423
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,596
My sister.

424
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:27,138
She thought maybe we could tie some product

425
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,055
to our brand.

426
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,388
Brand, really? That's what I do.

427
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,094
Branding, advertising...

428
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,719
Wow, that's...

429
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:33,844
pretty popular tonight.

430
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:42,008
So, uh...

431
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,383
what do you and your sister do?

432
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,548
We are
personal-trainers slash-nutritionists.

433
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,464
Really?

434
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:49,880
'Cause I'm looking for a personal trainer.

435
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,254
Really?

436
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:52,630
You mean you don't have
a gym where you work?

437
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:55,003
You know, I'm not really a
fan of going to the gym.

438
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,752
I work out. I play basketball,

439
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,252
but I'm just not into people watching me,

440
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,294
you know?

441
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:00,543
I'm sure a lot of your clients feel that.

442
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:01,668
I guess.

443
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,085
You know, I'd love to know
more about what you do,

444
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,667
the classes you offer,

445
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,916
the whole nutrition... thing.

446
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,083
Maybe you could tell me about that

447
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:09,373
over some real food?

448
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,165
There's a great Italian
place just down the street.

449
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,331
No.

450
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:13,914
No, you're gluten-free? We
could go somewhere else.

451
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,039
Nope. Not gluten-free.

452
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,788
Well, maybe I could just
get your card, or...

453
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,746
your number.

454
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,577
We could help each other, you know,

455
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,328
you with getting me in shape,
me with your branding.

456
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,409
Sorry. No.

457
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,659
Actually... yes.

458
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,241
Um... remember, no?

459
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,867
Mel would be thrilled to
give you a consultation.

460
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:31,699
That's what we do, you know,

461
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,740
go over people's personal goals.

462
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:34,823
That's great.

463
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:36,406
How about Saturday?10:00 A.M.?

464
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,822
Saturday it is.

465
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:39,363
Here you go.

466
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,405
Great.

467
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:43,112
I will shoot you an email with my address,

468
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:44,236
and I'll see you then.

469
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,153
Okay.

470
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,445
Bye.

471
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,110
What?

472
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:51,776
[Mel]: Take a deep breath in...

[inhales]

474
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
and release.

475
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:56,274
[exhales]

476
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,899
Thank you for sharing
your practice with us today.

477
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,523
Namaste.

478
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:01,647
Namaste.

479
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,897
Great class, everyone.

480
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:06,979
See you next week, and
remember, stay active.

481
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,562
Thank you! Bye!

482
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:10,728
Bye.

483
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,061
So you've got to get cleaned up.

484
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:13,602
You've got your 10 A.M.

485
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:14,934
Okay, you said shut it down,

486
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,559
and there I was, shutting it down,

487
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,642
and you just... started it back up.

488
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,932
He's in marketing, Mel.
That's exactly what we need.

489
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,807
Oh, come on, Jules. He's a salesman.

490
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,889
It was probably, like, a line or something.

491
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,431
Actually...

492
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:30,846
he's legit.

493
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:31,888
Okay, well then,

494
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:33,471
why don't you give him his consultation,

495
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,470
and maybe the two of you can
talk about all this stuff?

496
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:36,677
I can't.

497
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,886
I've got to do some errands.

498
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:39,302
So you'd better hurry. You
don't want to be late.

499
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:44,050
Fine...

500
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:46,381
but I'm wearing the ring.

501
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,590
This is strictly business.

502
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:04,752
[buzzer sounds]

503
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:07,500
Come in.

504
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,703
Looks like a rich
man's bachelor pad in here.

505
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,620
Wow.

506
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,161
Yeah, I guess it could
use a little redecorating.

507
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:29,368
A woman's touch, maybe?

508
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,451
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Danish?

509
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,242
No, I'm good.

510
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:34,700
Did you already eat?

511
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:36,615
Yeah, sorry, I was starving.

512
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:37,741
What did you have for breakfast?

513
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,614
Uh... a macchiato from the coffee shop,

514
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:41,989
and some cereal.

515
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,696
This cereal?

516
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:46,112
It's a... childhood habit.

517
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:48,194
Is this what you eat every
day for breakfast?

518
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:49,236
No, not every day...

519
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:50,403
Okay, yes, every day,

520
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:51,902
but sometimes, I also
get something at work.

521
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:55,276
This will obviously have to change.

522
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,066
So...

523
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:00,983
do you ever have breakfast with Will Peters?

524
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,024
Will?

525
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,898
Yeah, he's my boss, but he's also a buddy.

526
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,939
You know, we play poker, shoot hoops.

527
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:07,355
So, what, your buddy struck out,

528
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,688
and you figured you'd give
it a good old college try?

529
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,187
I'm sorry, I have no I...

530
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:12,603
You both hit on meat the party.

531
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,019
Well, obviously.

532
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,810
I mean, look at you. You're
beautiful and... oh...

533
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:17,852
Married?

534
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:18,810
Engaged.

535
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:19,767
Right.

536
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:20,809
[grunts]

537
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:21,851
What was that?

538
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:22,766
Nothing.

539
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,016
Sorry, I'm just surprised

540
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:24,891
because you weren't wearing your
ring the other night.

541
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:25,849
It's a bit loose,

542
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,724
so I get nervous wearing it out.

543
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:30,346
So, what are your exercise and
nutrition goals?

544
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:32,139
Actually, I think I'm already pretty fit.

545
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:36,846
Oh, yuck...

546
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,011
Do you know what?

547
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,261
Would you look at the time?
I actually have a...

548
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:42,593
Sorry, I do a lot of take out. Here.

549
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:44,508
I can see that.

550
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,759
Thank you.

[gasps]

553
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,007
Oh, no, no, no, no!

554
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:52,923
What?

555
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:54,090
Um, my ring just slipped off.

556
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,797
This is... this is bad. This is really bad.

557
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,047
It's okay, it's okay.

558
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,337
It's probably just stuck in the pipe.

559
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,003
[Mel]: Is it in there?

560
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:04,128
You know what,

561
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:05,003
you're going to have to
give me just one second.

562
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,252
Please, I can't lose it.

563
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,501
Yeah, I get that, but I'm
sure worst-case scenario,

564
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:09,667
your fiancé would understand.

565
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,709
That's the thing.I'm...

566
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,624
I'm not really engaged.
I'm giving the ring back.

567
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,708
What?

568
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:16,665
Why is that?

569
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:17,873
It didn't work out.

570
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,831
So you just wear the
ring to deter guys like me?

571
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:22,495
Okay, well, I've just been through a lot,

572
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:23,705
and yeah,

573
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,453
I do want to deter dating,
marriage, all of that stuff.

574
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,495
I'm done with it all.

575
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,453
[bang, grunts]

576
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:29,577
Are you okay?

577
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,035
Yeah.

578
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:35,617
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.

579
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,156
All right.

580
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,863
Well, I guess the next steps are

581
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,613
I will write you up a grocery list

582
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,238
of healthy food staples,

583
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,986
and we'll arrange a physical assessment,

584
00:21:50,987 --> 00:21:52,444
and take it from there.

585
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:53,486
Sound good?

586
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:54,652
Sure, whatever you think.

587
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:55,944
Okay.

588
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:58,651
Oh, no, no, it's okay. I'll
just let myself out...

589
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,692
and thank you again for the...

590
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,732
Don't mention it.

591
00:22:03,774 --> 00:22:05,607
'Kay.

592
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:13,354
You should have seen the look on his face

593
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:16,271
when I told him I was done with dating.

594
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:17,644
It was like a balloon deflating.

595
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:20,851
Well, did you at least talk to
him about our branding?

596
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,351
No, of course not.

597
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,434
What? I didn't want him thinking

598
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,517
I wanted to spend more time with him.

599
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:27,766
Besides, I'm pretty sure

600
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:28,766
he's trying to get out of
this whole training thing

601
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:29,848
anyway.

602
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,847
All right, here's the
rest of the guest list,

603
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,972
complete with addresses.

604
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,637
Why don't you start handing some to me,

605
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:38,346
and I will sign.

606
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:39,429
Sign what?

607
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,761
The invitations to your wedding anniversary.

608
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:44,927
Whoa. Is that the guest list?

609
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:48,218
Anna, I thought we agreed to keep it small.

610
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,050
You only expect60% of those you invite

611
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:52,298
to actually show up.

612
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,715
Well, if we're going to
haveth at many people over,

613
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:56,340
it was a good thing Rob was just here,

614
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:57,798
cutting back the shrubs.

615
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,129
He was?

616
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,671
I asked him to do some landscaping out back.

617
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:04,962
It's a garden party, right?

618
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:09,793
He mentioned, um... you've kept the ring.

619
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:12,792
I'm going to give the ring back.

620
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:14,791
Oh, Mel, why?

621
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,458
Rob's a great catch.

622
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,041
He has his own landscaping company.

623
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:20,706
He comes from a really nice family.

624
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,455
In fact, I just saw his mother...

625
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:23,539
[Gord]: Anna...

626
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,413
I think Roo made her decision.

627
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,120
Okay, fine.

628
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:29,536
If neither of you girls are getting married,

629
00:23:29,578 --> 00:23:30,786
then I am.

630
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,453
What?

631
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,952
Your father and I have decided,

632
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:35,618
at our wedding anniversary party,

633
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,076
we are going to renew our vows.

634
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,283
Aw...

635
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:42,615
And we want the two of you
to stand up for us.

636
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:45,281
Mom, Dad, that's amazing!

637
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,948
That's really beautiful.

638
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:49,112
Yeah, I thought so,

639
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:50,155
and maybe you girls will see

640
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:53,570
how special getting married can be.

641
00:23:58,277 --> 00:23:59,777
Hey!

642
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:00,902
Hey.

643
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm calling a do-over.
Starting from scratch.

644
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,442
No way.

645
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,274
The girl has sworn off everything, for good.

646
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,191
I mean, I should have known

647
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,272
something was up the other night

648
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,856
when she turned you down... but me?

649
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:14,105
Oh!

650
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:15,647
Nice.

651
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,895
Wait a second. You hit on her first...

652
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:21,770
which means you knew... you
knew she was damaged goods.

653
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:23,144
It's not my fault you didn't ask.

654
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:26,643
Nice, Will, real nice.

655
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:27,809
Ah...

656
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:32,599
Look, why don't you just admit defeat, okay?

657
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:34,931
I'm sure you can find the
hook in Bran Buddies,

658
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,015
be the Bran Buddy poster boy.

659
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,680
Is that what this is about?

660
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,929
[Fred]: Whoo-hoo-hoo! Check these out.

661
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,763
I just scored a pair of court-side seats

662
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:43,179
from the Juicy reps.

663
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,678
No, you didn't.You've got Little League.

664
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,344
Wow...

665
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:51,176
some accounts have all the perks.

666
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:53,591
I wonder how many perks Bran Buddies has?

667
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,300
Fine.

668
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:56,925
You know what? I'll make it happen.

669
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:57,882
My man!

670
00:24:57,924 --> 00:24:59,589
Vince, want to go to the game?

671
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,380
-Yeah!-Yeah!

672
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:04,380
I can get out of Little League.

673
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,462
[Jules]: Take a deep breath. Hands up...

674
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:10,794
[inhaling]

675
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:12,294
and Swan down...

676
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:14,418
No, I'm going to take a class right now.

677
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,751
[whispering]It's already started.

678
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:17,917
Bye. Bye-bye-bye.

679
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,583
[Jules]: Up in the chest...

680
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,415
[whispering]Can I squeeze in between you?

681
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,915
And when you're ready,
step back into Plank pose,

682
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:28,206
and down into Cobra.

683
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:29,580
Open the chest...

684
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:30,787
[inhales]

685
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,743
[Jules]: Downward-facing dog.

686
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,118
[back cracks, groans in pain]

687
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,868
Take a few steps with your feet,

688
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,617
stretch out the calves...

689
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:46,866
Take a breath up.

690
00:25:46,908 --> 00:25:49,656
Back down... and arms up.

691
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:55,321
[Jules]: Prayer to the heart.

692
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:56,404
Breathe.

693
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,569
Into Eagle pose.

694
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,651
Wrap your foot around your left leg.

695
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:08,025
Hands together. Bend into it.

696
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,065
Put your left under your right.

697
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:14,023
Settle in deep.Breathe.

698
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:16,023
- [groans]
- Breathe...

699
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:18,813
Feel your body.

700
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:21,687
And when you’re ready,

701
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:25,727
uncross your arms and then your legs,

702
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:27,227
and take them out of the pose...

703
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,642
and hands to heart,

704
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:34,141
Prayer pose.

705
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:37,181
Thank you so much for coming today.

706
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:38,515
Namaste.

707
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,389
Namaste.

708
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,680
-Thank you!-Thank you!

709
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:43,597
-Thank you so much.-Namaste. Namaste!

710
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:45,887
Namaste![high fives]

711
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,385
[Jules]: 'Kay, thank you so much, everyone!

712
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,261
Have a great week! We'll see you soon. Bye!

713
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:51,343
Wow.

714
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,759
This is a really great set-up you guys have.

715
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:55,800
You think?

716
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:57,967
Actually, we're looking for a bigger space.

717
00:26:58,009 --> 00:26:59,382
Really?

718
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,924
I love this whole home vibe thing.

719
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,882
I think it really works with
your sister act.

720
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,547
-You think?-Yeah, for sure.

721
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:05,713
You know, if you were
thinking of branding,

722
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:07,213
that's the whole approach I would take.

723
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:09,545
If you wanted,

724
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,544
I could do up, like, a social media pitch,

725
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:13,420
press kit...

726
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:16,002
That's a great idea! Right, Mel?

727
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:18,543
Uh, did you get my grocery list?

728
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:21,374
I did. There's just one problem.

729
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,625
I get it.

730
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,708
It's probably too complicated,
what with your lifestyle,

731
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:25,707
so if you don't want

732
00:27:25,748 --> 00:27:26,915
to go through with this whole thing,

733
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:29,622
I completely understand.

734
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,538
No, that's not it. I just...

735
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:34,037
I wouldn't have the first
clue where to find, uh...

736
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,162
chia seeds,

737
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:37,661
or... broccolini?

738
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:38,786
I don't even know what that looks like.

739
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,286
Is that, like, a little mini broccoli?

740
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,200
It's actually a cross

741
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:43,867
between asparagus and broccoli.

742
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:45,867
See? No clue.

743
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:47,908
I was thinking,

744
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,199
maybe we could go grocery shopping together.

745
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:50,699
Together?

746
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,115
No, no, we don't have to do that.

747
00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:53,363
Actually, I can order the food

748
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:55,030
and have it delivered right to you.

749
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:56,362
Sure,

750
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:58,904
but I probably should learn how
to do it myself, right?

751
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:00,404
I mean, the only aisle I'm familiar with

752
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,237
is the freezer aisle.

753
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,820
Well, he's got a point.

754
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:05,902
Jules, why don't you go ahead and
take Damon grocery shopping,

755
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:08,525
seeing as how we've got this
whole sister act thing

756
00:28:08,526 --> 00:28:09,734
going on.

757
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,191
Hey, Mel.

758
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,439
Rob! Hi.

759
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:19,522
What are you doing here?

760
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,564
Thought I'd come by

761
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:21,605
and see if you wanted to go for a jog.

762
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:23,813
Remember our Sunday 10Ks?

763
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,519
Yeah, I do, but, um...

764
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,977
actually, I was just about to go take Damon,

765
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:31,810
our new client, grocery shopping.

766
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,976
Right? Are you good to go?

767
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:36,100
Yeah, sure, I can... I'll shower later.

768
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:37,142
Okay, great.

769
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:37,850
Yeah.

770
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,224
10K? That's impressive.

771
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:48,388
You want an energy bar for your run?

772
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:54,553
Hi.

773
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:57,135
This is broccolini.

774
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,009
Oh!

775
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,675
What do you do with it?

776
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:01,633
You can steam it, sauté it...

777
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:03,424
Maybe you could show me some time.

778
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:07,589
Don't worry, I'll make sure you
get a step-by-step recipe.

779
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:08,506
Are you sure?

780
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:09,548
'Cause I'm really not a good cook.

781
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:12,170
My... my mom, she never taught me,

782
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:14,087
not that she was much of a cook anyway.

783
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,378
Actually, I usually ate alone,

784
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:18,961
but me and the pizza guy,
we got pretty chummy.

785
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,334
Why were you alone so much?

786
00:29:21,335 --> 00:29:23,334
My mom, she worked a lot,

787
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,667
and Dad wasn't really around.

788
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,832
Well, I love pizza.

789
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,957
Really?

790
00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:32,122
Like, whole wheat with soy
cheese or something?

791
00:29:32,164 --> 00:29:33,830
That kind of thing?

792
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:34,996
No.

793
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,995
Extra cheese, double the
meat, mushrooms, and olives.

794
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,453
I love olives on my pizza.

795
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,411
It brings out the flavor in
the salami or something.

796
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:42,661
Exactly.

797
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:44,827
So Rob, he's your...?

798
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:46,743
Ex-fiancé.

799
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,159
I guess he didn't get the memo.

800
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:51,157
Which is odd, because I feel like
leaving him at the altar

801
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:52,741
was sending a pretty big message.

802
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:54,656
Suppose he's not The One?

803
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:56,490
Nope... whatever that means.

804
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,655
You're telling me you don't
believe in soulmates

805
00:29:57,656 --> 00:29:58,781
and all that?

806
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:00,905
Why? Do you?

807
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:02,695
Yeah, yeah, of course.

808
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:04,861
Have you ever met The One?

809
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,528
Not yet, but...

810
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:09,610
still looking.

811
00:30:09,652 --> 00:30:11,692
Off to the grain section.

812
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:15,649
Now, you're going to want to look for

813
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,399
whole grains, not refined.

814
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,649
Have you always been into all this?

815
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,273
Are you kidding me?

816
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:23,314
I was the awkward, unhealthy kid.

817
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:24,522
I loved candy bars.

818
00:30:24,563 --> 00:30:26,063
Thank you.

819
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:31,936
Great, let's check out some fruit.

820
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,560
All right, the good stuff.

821
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:34,519
Apples, yeah...

822
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,475
Oh, sorry! Sorry! Uh...

823
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:37,684
Mel?

824
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,307
Justin! Hi! How are you?

825
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:42,100
Great.

826
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,349
I was going to call you about
your running group.

827
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,723
Kelly says we need to start doing something,

828
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:47,597
'cause you know what they say,

829
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,138
the couple that runs together

830
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,096
stays together.

831
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:52,387
Is that what we should have done?

832
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,261
I'm kidding.

833
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:55,512
Right.

834
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,135
So we'll just go online and sign up.

835
00:30:58,177 --> 00:30:59,802
Absolutely. I'll see you on the track.

836
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:02,717
Hey, bud,

837
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,008
there's some spilt juice by the smoothies.

838
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:10,089
Who was that guy?

839
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:12,422
Oh, that was Justin...

840
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:15,755
my, uh... my first fiancé.

841
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:17,837
You were engaged before Rob?

842
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:18,920
Twice, actually.

843
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,920
Three times. You've been
engaged three times?

844
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:21,835
Mm-hmm.

845
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:24,210
Well, it looks like we’re done here,

846
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,251
so I'm just going to get going.

847
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:29,083
Yes, do you want me to drive you or...?

848
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,916
Oh, no, it's okay. I'll walk.

849
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:33,248
I didn't go for that run, so...

850
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,831
I will see you for your assessment.

851
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:36,247
Yes.

852
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:38,164
Okay.

853
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,951
[Damon]: Three dudes have proposed to her,

854
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:49,077
and she said yes every time.

855
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:50,035
Isn't that good?

856
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,451
I mean, she's said "yes" three times,

857
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,408
so a fourth should be no big deal, right?

858
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,325
No, it's not good

859
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:55,741
because she didn't marry any of them,

860
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,657
and I'm guessing that's
why she’s thrown in the towel.

861
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:58,947
Sounds like you should start working

862
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,113
on the Bran Buddies account.

863
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:02,739
Three pulled pork tacos,
please, extra hot sauce.

864
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:03,780
Have you asked her

865
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,404
why it didn't work outwith the first three?

866
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:06,362
Are you kidding?

867
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:07,779
I mean, I could tell she was embarrassed.

868
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,777
Plus... what if it's her?

869
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,152
You know, what if
there’s something wrong with her?

870
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:13,194
She looked fine to me.

871
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,108
You should dig a little deeper.

872
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:16,484
I mean, women love it

873
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:18,108
when you seem interested in them.

874
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,149
Susan thinks I'm right into her Reiki,

875
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:22,440
when really, I don’t understand it at all.

876
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,523
Who does?

877
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:25,272
Well, she likes olives.

878
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:26,606
Wow, good for you.

879
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,771
You're really getting to
know her, aren't you.

880
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:29,813
Thank you!

881
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:31,604
[laughing]

882
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,729
What a guy.

883
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:34,935
[Mel]: Keep breathing. Legs up.

884
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,102
Okay, toss the ball. Right?

885
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:37,186
All right.

886
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:38,809
Catch.

887
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:39,893
Nice. Toss it back.

888
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:40,768
Okay.

889
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:41,768
Keep breathing, breathing...

890
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:42,892
I'm giving you a weight now.

891
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,558
Easy.

892
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,598
You've obviously got a strong core.

893
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,390
Let's go down to the
ground and do the Pigeon.

894
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:49,723
Okay, follow me.

895
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:52,388
Right leg forward, left leg back,

896
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,597
go down onto your elbows.

897
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,679
Breathe. You feel that stretch?

898
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,179
Oh, I feel that.

899
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,428
All right, Bendy, can you do this?

900
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:03,218
Oh, impressive, hot shot...

901
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,800
but my dad can do that.

902
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:06,759
Can your dad do...

903
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,633
this?

904
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:12,007
Nope, but my Scouts can.

905
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:12,923
Oh.

906
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,255
All right, can you do this?

907
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:15,921
Right leg forward, left leg back.

908
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:17,088
Okay.

909
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,420
Knee, uh... an inch above the ground.

910
00:33:19,421 --> 00:33:20,379
Right there, yeah.

911
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:21,420
We're going to test your stability.

912
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:22,754
I'm going to push you, okay? Ready?

913
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,419
Yeah, how's that for stable?

914
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,377
'Kay.

915
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:26,544
Don't hurt your fingers.

916
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:27,543
Ready?

917
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:29,126
Yep.

918
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:30,500
That's Choco Puff power.

919
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:31,375
Yeah?

920
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,708
How's this for vegetable power?

921
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,082
Yeah?

922
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:36,291
Well, let's check your stability,

923
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:37,873
-Vegetable power.-Oof!

924
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:39,789
[hisses in pain]

925
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,456
Uh... ooh...

926
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,329
-Your knee?-Yeah.

927
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:45,163
You all right?

928
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:46,412
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

929
00:33:46,454 --> 00:33:47,661
Mm...

930
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:50,035
It's okay. It should be fine now.

931
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:51,243
I don't know about that.

932
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,618
You really should rest
it the first few hours.

933
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,909
I think I know what I'm doing.

934
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:55,743
[whimpers in pain]

935
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,742
Okay, that's it. You're staying...

936
00:33:57,783 --> 00:34:00,073
at least until the swelling goes down.

937
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:01,781
Fine.

938
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:14,194
[Mel]: Pizza's not
usually on the health menu.

939
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:15,485
[Damon]: It is tonight.

940
00:34:15,527 --> 00:34:17,068
Doesn't hurt to cheat every now and then.

941
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,692
This is so good.

942
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:22,024
What? Do I have something on my face?

943
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:24,232
No, it's just me. I, uh...

944
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:28,106
I just like when people surprise me.

945
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:30,230
So tell me something about yourself.

946
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,313
Is it just you and your sister,

947
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,187
or... you have family here?

948
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:34,229
My parents are here.

949
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:35,187
They're actually celebrating

950
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:36,645
their 30-year wedding anniversary

951
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:37,728
in a month.

952
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,144
Really? Wow, that's amazing.

953
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:40,477
What about your parents?

954
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,560
They're celebrating20
years of being divorced.

955
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:44,892
Is that why your dad wasn’t around?

956
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:46,808
Yeah, that would be why...

957
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,307
but my mom did the best she could.

958
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:50,723
You know, she worked a lot of night shifts,

959
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,556
but she always made a point to
have breakfast with me.

960
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,097
A bowl of Choco Pops, every morning.

961
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,886
You mentioned Scouts earlier.

962
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,886
You a leader, or just a really tall Scout?

963
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:02,052
I volunteer at the community center

964
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:03,012
on Tuesdays.

965
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,094
Were you a Scout?

966
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,677
Straight through to Explorer.

967
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:17,339
This was right after I
got my survival badge.

968
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,381
Oh!

969
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,880
-That's a tough one to get.-Yeah.

970
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:23,046
These guys were like the
brothers I never had.

971
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:28,294
I promise to always do my best,

972
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:32,208
to keep myself strong in mind and body,

973
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:33,543
to always help those in need,

974
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,999
and to help myself through positivity

975
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,125
and good values.

976
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,082
I'm impressed.

977
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:40,165
Thanks.

978
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,372
Hey...

979
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,747
I know it wasn’t on the grocery list,

980
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:44,831
but I happen to have some ice cream

981
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:46,037
in the freezer.

982
00:35:46,038 --> 00:35:47,912
Now, I know you said to get
rid of all that stuff,

983
00:35:47,954 --> 00:35:50,453
but come on, it's ice cream.

984
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:53,535
Well, it does have calcium.

985
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,576
Especially if you put whipped cream on top.

986
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:57,201
Oh, I have got whipped cream.

987
00:35:57,243 --> 00:35:59,076
I'll make us a couple sundaes?

988
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,366
I love it.

989
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,866
Good.

990
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:18,986
You know, you are turning out

991
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:21,026
to be the best
personal-trainer slash-nutritionist ever.

992
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:35,896
So you hurt your knee,

993
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:38,062
and then you stayed over and had dinner

994
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:39,728
together with Damon.

995
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,352
No... I mean, yeah,

996
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:42,894
but it wasn’t like that.

997
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,060
You know,

998
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,018
the first few hours after an
injury are crucial,

999
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
so I was doing the right thing.

1000
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,101
Uh-huh.

1001
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:50,475
Don't "uh-huh" me, Jules. He's a client...

1002
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:52,849
one that you insisted we take on.

1003
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,682
Besides, even if I was interested,

1004
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:56,056
which I am not,

1005
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,430
I doubt it would go anywhere,

1006
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,721
because his parents
divorced when he was younger,

1007
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,262
and I can tell by the way he talks about it,

1008
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,595
he still has some serious issues from it.

1009
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:04,553
Actually, I wouldn't be surprised

1010
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:05,844
if he was scared of marriage.

1011
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:08,343
Then you don't have anything
to worry about...

1012
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:10,342
you know, with you two hanging out

1013
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:12,176
and eating pizza.

1014
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:13,258
Exactly.

1015
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,591
Actually, I kind of just feel bad for him.

1016
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,799
I mean, it'd be sad

1017
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,506
if he was putting off getting married.

1018
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:20,256
Who's putting off getting married?

1019
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,256
Me.

1020
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:22,422
Damon.

1021
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:23,505
Sweetheart, don't say that.

1022
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,921
I mean, wait... look what I had fixed.

1023
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:29,002
If this can be fixed, so
can your relationship.

1024
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:29,962
Mom, why did you do that?

1025
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:32,002
Now, now, now, don't bug Mom

1026
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,335
because she changed your ex's name

1027
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,000
on the cheese board.

1028
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:36,001
Speaking of cheese board,

1029
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:38,000
let's put some cheese on there, huh?

1030
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,374
Who's this Damon your sister mentioned?

1031
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:43,540
Hmm?

1032
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:45,247
Oh, he's just a client.

1033
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,373
Single client?

1034
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:47,622
I don't know. Is he?

1035
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:48,829
I don't know.

1036
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,788
You know what?

1037
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:51,080
Let's go help Jules with that cheese

1038
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:52,663
because I am suddenly so hungry.

1039
00:37:55,911 --> 00:38:00,284
She is in unreal shape. It's insane.

1040
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:01,493
She was doing these abs
things like they're nothing.

1041
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:02,659
I'm going to be hurting for a week!

1042
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,157
So she's doing all these moves, right,

1043
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:06,574
trying to impress me with
these exercise moves,

1044
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:07,949
and she, like, blows out her knee,

1045
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,614
so we just end up eating pizza...

1046
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:13,489
uh, with olives, obviously,

1047
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,154
and they were black, not green.

1048
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:16,237
You should have seen her.

1049
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:17,154
It was awesome.

1050
00:38:17,196 --> 00:38:19,570
She had, like, five slices.

1051
00:38:20,611 --> 00:38:21,653
Oh, and then,

1052
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:24,568
I find out that she used to
be a Scout, like me,

1053
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,108
only she still does it, like...
a volunteer, you know?

1054
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,025
How nice is that?

1055
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:31,315
Are you going to bowl or what?

1056
00:38:31,316 --> 00:38:32,481
Right.

1057
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,814
[Fred]: Well, I'm glad you
took my advice to heart.

1058
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:37,189
I mean, when you start
falling for someone...

1059
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,355
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1060
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:39,978
Okay, no one is falling for anybody,

1061
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:41,979
all right?

1062
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,187
It's like you said.

1063
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:45,143
I don't even know what she's into, you know,

1064
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:46,518
if we're going to have anything in common.

1065
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,477
It's just... hit or miss.

1066
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,768
Just sometimes... I hit it.

1067
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:51,892
Like this...

1068
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:59,098
Oh! Yes!

1069
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,139
I am on a winning streak.

1070
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:01,264
Unbelievable.

1071
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,553
Okay, we are going to start working

1072
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,968
on our friendship badges.

1073
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,509
No better way to do that

1074
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:17,508
than to start with working and
making friendship bracelets.

1075
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,174
This is everything you’re going to need.

1076
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:23,214
This is for your table.
You can take that back.

1077
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:25,173
All right, have fun!

1078
00:39:34,461 --> 00:39:35,336
Avery...

1079
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:36,543
why not join the other girls

1080
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:38,501
and make a friendship bracelet, too?

1081
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,333
Oh, no thanks. I'd rather not.

1082
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:50,456
Besides, I won't have a
friend to give it to anyway.

1083
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:53,455
Avery... just try.

1084
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:54,954
Please make a bracelet.

1085
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:57,952
You will arena nifty badge,

1086
00:39:57,953 --> 00:40:00,369
and it will come in handy one day...

1087
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:02,035
and I promise,

1088
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:03,868
you will have a friend to give it to.

1089
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:07,658
Okay.

1090
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,240
What do you think? Blue? It's so pretty.

1091
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:13,115
Okay...

1092
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:17,030
Today, we're going to be Good Samaritans,

1093
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:18,904
as we should be every day,

1094
00:40:18,946 --> 00:40:21,904
and we are going to now
work on our environment badges

1095
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:23,111
by going outside

1096
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,111
and cleaning up the park next
to our community center.

1097
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:27,110
So everybody grab a pair of gloves!

1098
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,525
Okay, does everyone have a pair of gloves?

1099
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:31,358
Yeah!

1100
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,442
[Damon]: You know, actually...

1101
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:34,357
I don't.

1102
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,857
Could I borrow a pair?

1103
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,021
Oh, thank you!

1104
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,520
Just a second, girls.

1105
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,102
What are you doing here?

1106
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:51,476
I'm volunteering.

1107
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,601
Uh, well,

1108
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:54,392
technically, I'm training to
become a volunteer.

1109
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:55,559
Right now, I'm on probation,

1110
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:57,391
but I'm sure with you as
my coach, I'll pass.

1111
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:59,057
Right?

1112
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,097
Is this something new, or...

1113
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:04,139
You inspired me.

1114
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,305
So here I am.

1115
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:08,929
All right,

1116
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,304
but don't think I'll go easy on you.

1117
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:11,803
Hey, you've already put me through
the gears as my trainer,

1118
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,344
so I wouldn't expect anything less.

1119
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:15,594
Good.

1120
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:19,091
Okay, girls, this is your new
Scout leader-in-training,

1121
00:41:19,092 --> 00:41:20,092
Mr. Damon.

1122
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:21,009
[they giggle]

1123
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,924
Hi, Mr. Damon.

1124
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:23,257
Pleasure to meet you. May I say,

1125
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:25,591
you all look very smashing in your uniforms.

1126
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:27,590
Okay, everyone, find a partner.

1127
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:29,256
Pair up and let's go.

1128
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:31,422
Okay, Eva, you want to be my partner?

1129
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:35,587
That's Avery. She always
has such a hard time.

1130
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:36,918
Give me a minute.

1131
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,003
Yeah.

1132
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:43,667
Avery, please join the other girls in line.

1133
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,374
They don't like me.

1134
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,748
It's okay. I'll be right there with you.

1135
00:41:52,664 --> 00:41:53,581
[Damon grunts]

1136
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:55,788
[strains and grunts]

1137
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,121
Avery, did you give
me tiny gloves on purpose?

1138
00:41:57,162 --> 00:41:58,954
Hey, listen.

1139
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,744
It's my first day, and
I'm a little nervous.

1140
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:02,828
Would you mind showing me the ropes?

1141
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,327
-Yeah, okay.-Okay?

1142
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:07,326
Avery, you can walk with me

1143
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:09,242
and help me keep an eye on Mr. Damon.

1144
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:10,783
Yeah, okay.

1145
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:12,407
Okay, girls!

1146
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:13,906
Uh, Mia, Lisa, lead the way out.

1147
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,073
Let's go! Let's go!

1148
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:18,364
Avery, maybe outside,

1149
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:21,029
you can join Mia and Lisa and be a trio.

1150
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,402
So what's the story there?

1151
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:30,818
[Mel]: Avery?

1152
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:32,734
She's just really shy.

1153
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:35,650
She gets bullied at school,
that kind of thing.

1154
00:42:35,692 --> 00:42:36,774
Her parents figured

1155
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,315
this would be a positive
environment for her.

1156
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:41,023
Well, it worked for me.

1157
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:44,814
So how many badges did
you end up collecting?

1158
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:46,688
21.

1159
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:47,604
Impressive.

1160
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:49,520
Mm-hmm. What about you?

1161
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:50,353
Just shy of 18.

1162
00:42:50,395 --> 00:42:52,602
Oh, not bad, not bad.

1163
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,977
I wanted to get more,

1164
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:56,601
especially the leadership badge.

1165
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,683
I was working towards that
one when my parents split, so...

1166
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:03,432
had to give it up.

1167
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,889
You know, no one to take me...

1168
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:09,264
I figured my mom could use the
help around the house.

1169
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,720
Put the Scout training to work, you know?

1170
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:14,386
Helped with the garbage, the lawn...

1171
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:18,344
Well, I'm sure your
mom appreciated all that you did.

1172
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:24,216
Maybe we can start working on
your culinary badge.

1173
00:43:24,217 --> 00:43:26,466
You did get my recipes, right?

1174
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:27,715
Yes, I did.

1175
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,632
Going to try out the first one tonight.

1176
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:30,673
[blows whistle]

1177
00:43:30,714 --> 00:43:32,213
Okay!

1178
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,212
How about we play a game of "it" tag?

1179
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:35,338
Guess who's it?

1180
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,504
I am!

1181
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:37,671
[screaming]

1182
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:38,920
[Damon]: Oh, no!

1183
00:43:38,962 --> 00:43:41,253
I'm going to get you, I'm going to get you!

1184
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,499
[laughing]

1185
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:54,832
You're it! She's it!

1186
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:06,619
[Mel screams and laughs]

1187
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:15,908
Mel!

1188
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,698
I'll be right back, okay?

1189
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:22,364
All right, come here.

1190
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,071
Rob...

1191
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:26,112
what are you doing here?

1192
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:27,154
I just landed

1193
00:44:27,196 --> 00:44:29,278
the community center landscaping project.

1194
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,361
It's big.

1195
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:32,069
They're landscaping their entire property.

1196
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,443
Wow, that's great.

1197
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:36,526
What's your client doing here?

1198
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:37,733
Damon?

1199
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,233
Oh, he's training to become a Scout leader.

1200
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:41,523
For girls?

1201
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:43,607
Men can be Scout leaders, too.

1202
00:44:43,649 --> 00:44:45,898
In fact, Chloe's
dad volunteered all last year.

1203
00:44:45,939 --> 00:44:47,605
Oh, Damon has a kid?

1204
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:49,230
No.

1205
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,396
He's not even married.

1206
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,937
Oh, really?

1207
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:53,686
Time out, time out!

1208
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:54,894
Well, look,

1209
00:44:54,936 --> 00:44:56,519
I wanted to talk to you about
setting another date.

1210
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,976
Date?

1211
00:44:58,018 --> 00:45:00,559
Nothing too soon from now or anything.

1212
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:01,809
Rob, I...

1213
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:05,266
I don't know. We talked about this.

1214
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:09,431
Girls, I've got an idea

1215
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,097
as to who might really like to be it,

1216
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:14,012
but you're going to have to
help me convince her, okay?

1217
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,387
I know, and I told you,
I'm not giving up on us.

1218
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:18,345
Just think how happy it
will make your mother.

1219
00:45:18,386 --> 00:45:20,636
Plus, we make a really good team.

1220
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,676
Rob...

1221
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:25,343
I don't want to just make a good team.

1222
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:26,342
I want...

1223
00:45:26,342 --> 00:45:27,300
What?

1224
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:29,883
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1225
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:31,049
You're "it".

1226
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,799
Oh, I am, am I?

1227
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,839
[laughs]

1228
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,173
Mel...

1229
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:36,505
I'm sorry, Rob, this is their time,

1230
00:45:36,506 --> 00:45:38,922
but we'll chat later, okay?

1231
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:41,837
I'm going to get you!

1232
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:43,795
She's it, she's it!

1233
00:45:43,836 --> 00:45:46,085
Girls, your moms are here,

1234
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:47,667
so make sure you have everything.

1235
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:48,792
Great job today.

1236
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,083
Bye, girls! Bye!

1237
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,124
You did all right today.

1238
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,374
Well, thank you,

1239
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:56,831
and hey, I'm sorry about earlier,

1240
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:58,748
but it kind of looked
like you needed an out.

1241
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:59,955
Right.

1242
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:02,330
So, uh...

1243
00:46:02,331 --> 00:46:04,829
when did you realize that
Rob and the other...

1244
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:05,829
is it two?

1245
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:08,286
Yes, there are just three, thankfully.

1246
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:09,952
Right.

1247
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:11,785
When did you realize you
should have said no?

1248
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:13,951
I'm pretty sure I knew even
before they proposed.

1249
00:46:13,993 --> 00:46:16,491
It was just so overwhelming when they did.

1250
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:17,824
I mean, Justin,

1251
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:19,449
he did it over the loudspeaker

1252
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:21,032
of the store that he managed.

1253
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:23,489
Darren did it while
reporting on the weather,

1254
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,822
and Rob was in front of a packed spin class.

1255
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:26,905
Ouch.

1256
00:46:26,946 --> 00:46:28,030
I know, right?

1257
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:29,986
And then my mom, she tried to convince me

1258
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,945
that I would grow to
love them in "that way,"

1259
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:33,278
but I didn't.

1260
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,944
And what way is that?

1261
00:46:34,986 --> 00:46:36,152
You know, the way you should feel

1262
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,152
when they propose...

1263
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:39,692
that giddy feeling knowing

1264
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,816
you'll get to spend the rest of
your life with this person

1265
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:44,981
that makes you believe in
happily ever after.

1266
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,773
That way.

1267
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:56,853
Wow, you look all fancy for taco night.

1268
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:59,852
Actually, I am not going to
Mom and Dad's tonight.

1269
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:00,977
I have a date.

1270
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,018
Really? Is it someone I know?

1271
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:05,850
Ian, from running group.

1272
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:08,807
Oh, Jules, that's so great. He
seems like such a sweet guy.

1273
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:10,141
Yeah.

1274
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:12,098
It's been such a long time, I
hope I remember how it's done.

1275
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,137
Mm, just be yourself,
and it will be amazing.

1276
00:47:16,138 --> 00:47:17,263
Thanks.

1277
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:18,637
Hey, um, keep your phone on you

1278
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:21,428
in case I need to send you a "help me" text.

1279
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,886
I got you.

1280
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,760
Have fun.

1281
00:47:27,968 --> 00:47:31,467
Okay, season lean chicken breast...

1282
00:47:36,631 --> 00:47:39,630
and then pop in the oven for 10 minutes.

1283
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:41,297
Okay.

1284
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:46,670
Now... you.

1285
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:48,335
Oil pan...

1286
00:47:52,293 --> 00:47:53,460
and...

1287
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,208
trim ends of the broccolini.

1288
00:48:02,457 --> 00:48:03,456
Okay!

1289
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:05,038
Done!

1290
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:10,078
Hashtag, master chef.

1291
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:20,783
Yes!

1292
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:22,408
Yes, yes!

1293
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,613
[laughs]

1294
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,695
[sizzling]

1295
00:48:35,737 --> 00:48:37,319
[smoke alarm beeps]

1296
00:48:39,943 --> 00:48:42,068
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1297
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,940
Oh, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

1298
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,271
[alarm continues beeping]

1299
00:48:54,272 --> 00:48:56,188
Come on, come on...

1300
00:49:02,436 --> 00:49:03,644
[stops beeping]

1301
00:49:10,308 --> 00:49:11,766
[phone rings]

1302
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:12,683
Hey, Damon.

1303
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:14,431
I just set my kitchen on fire.

1304
00:49:14,432 --> 00:49:15,598
Oh, no!

1305
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,681
Yeah.

1306
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:17,889
I was trying one of the recipes you gave me,

1307
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:21,304
and then there was smoke and fire

1308
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:22,721
and my alarm going off.

1309
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:25,345
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1310
00:49:25,387 --> 00:49:26,469
Maybe you were right,

1311
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:28,219
and I should have helped
you out the first time.

1312
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:30,759
No, it's not you. It's, uh...

1313
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,925
just...

1314
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:33,259
now I'm forced to order take-out again,

1315
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,424
so I was...

1316
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:37,632
wondering if you... if
you wanted to join me?

1317
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,256
Actually, I can't.

1318
00:49:39,257 --> 00:49:41,172
It's taco night at my parents' house.

1319
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:42,588
Tacos, huh?

1320
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:43,672
I love tacos.

1321
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:44,714
Me and my buddies, we hit the truck

1322
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:45,754
at least twice a week.

1323
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,504
Well...

1324
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:50,336
would you maybe want to join us?

1325
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:52,086
I mean, what kind of nutritionist

1326
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:53,293
would I be anyway

1327
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:55,043
if I sent you off to some
greasy take-out joint?

1328
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:56,167
You have a point.

1329
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:58,750
Great. I will come by and pick you up.

1330
00:49:58,792 --> 00:49:59,750
Okay, see you soon.

1331
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:01,041
Bye.

1332
00:50:10,496 --> 00:50:12,245
Who shoots hoops?

1333
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:13,745
Oh, that's me and my dad.

1334
00:50:13,787 --> 00:50:15,077
After dinner, we usually come outside

1335
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,619
and play a little one-on-one.

1336
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:17,742
Yeah, you any good?

1337
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:18,868
Well, let's just say my dad calls me "Roo"

1338
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,910
because I got bounce.

1339
00:50:19,952 --> 00:50:20,826
Really?

1340
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:21,867
'Cause I play with some buddies,

1341
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:23,074
and I'm a bit of a ringer myself.

1342
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:25,533
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

1343
00:50:26,865 --> 00:50:27,615
Hello!

1344
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,864
Oh, Mel, honey! Hi, sweetie!

1345
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:30,906
Oh, and...?

1346
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:32,614
Hi. Damon Hadley.

1347
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:34,404
Hi, Damon. Nice to meet you.

1348
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:35,405
Anna.

1349
00:50:35,406 --> 00:50:36,445
Mel didn't tell me she was bringing a date.

1350
00:50:36,487 --> 00:50:39,236
Oh, Damon's not my date. He's a client.

1351
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,569
Oh.

1352
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:41,735
I almost burned down my kitchen

1353
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:43,900
trying one of your daughter’s recipes, so...

1354
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:45,400
Gord, this is Damon, Mel's...

1355
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:46,609
Client, Dad.

1356
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:49,233
I figured the least I could
do is invite him over to dinner

1357
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:51,564
after one of my recipes failed.

1358
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:52,524
Nice to meet you.

1359
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:54,064
Pleasure to meet you, sir,

1360
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,939
and your daughter's recipes, they're great.

1361
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,897
I'm the problem.

1362
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:57,980
I never really learned how to cook.

1363
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,063
[Mel]: You know,

1364
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:00,895
I usually help my mom make the tacos,

1365
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:02,562
but if you wanted to...

1366
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:03,853
I wouldn't want to impose.

1367
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,353
No, no, not at all.

1368
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,143
Come on in. We'll get you set up.

1369
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,475
All right, now, a pinch of cumin.

1370
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:14,016
Oh, okay.

1371
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:16,432
Taste it. Always taste.

1372
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:18,640
What do you think?

1373
00:51:18,682 --> 00:51:20,181
Oh... I always like a lot of spice.

1374
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:21,764
Perfect, me too.Here.

1375
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:22,887
This one's for you.

1376
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:24,596
All right!

1377
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:25,887
And then the key

1378
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:27,220
is to julienne the carrots like this.

1379
00:51:27,221 --> 00:51:28,552
You throw those in with the cabbage,

1380
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,136
toss it...

1381
00:51:31,386 --> 00:51:32,843
and then you make your taco...

1382
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:33,885
Uh-huh.

1383
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,467
Like that...

1384
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,175
Perfect.

1385
00:51:37,217 --> 00:51:38,882
All right! There we go.

1386
00:51:38,883 --> 00:51:41,132
Yes! Okay. If you can grab the tacos...

1387
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:42,049
Yes.

1388
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,923
I will get the hot sauce.

1389
00:51:43,964 --> 00:51:46,214
Dinner's served!

1390
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:49,671
[crunches]

1391
00:51:51,796 --> 00:51:53,253
Damon, these are so delicious.

1392
00:51:53,295 --> 00:51:54,211
Thank you.

1393
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:56,044
He's a quick learner, too, which is good.

1394
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:57,002
Who doesn't love a man

1395
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,293
who knows his way around a kitchen?

1396
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,542
Or a gal who knows her way around
the basketball court.

1397
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:02,625
Isn't that right, Roo?

1398
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,916
Oh, yeah, Roo.

1399
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,208
Mel told me about that.

1400
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:07,499
She got that from her mad
skills on the court?

1401
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,456
Uh, you know what?

1402
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:09,706
I'm just going to clear away some dishes.

1403
00:52:09,748 --> 00:52:10,871
Well, actually,

1404
00:52:10,872 --> 00:52:12,204
she got it

1405
00:52:12,205 --> 00:52:13,288
from her bounce at the altar.

1406
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,038
I mean, just like a kangaroo,

1407
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:16,702
this one would bounce out of there

1408
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:18,827
before anyone had a chance to say, "I do".

1409
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:21,535
Gordon!

1410
00:52:22,618 --> 00:52:25,033
Um, well, I'm sure once Mel
meets the right person,

1411
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:26,117
she won't bounce anymore.

1412
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,450
You're absolutely right, Damon.

1413
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:29,824
What about you?

1414
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:31,407
Anyone special in your life?

1415
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,948
No, still... still searching.

1416
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:34,073
[Anna]: Really?

1417
00:52:34,114 --> 00:52:36,614
Uh, hey, Mom, what's all this stuff?

1418
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:39,071
Oh, I'm putting together a video collage

1419
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:40,695
for our anniversary party.

1420
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:41,653
30 years.

1421
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:43,611
I heard. That's incredible.

1422
00:52:43,653 --> 00:52:45,319
I'm a lucky man.

1423
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:46,818
Why are you putting these in there?

1424
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:50,525
To show our joy over the last 30 years,

1425
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,359
which, of course, includes
you and your sister.

1426
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,524
By the way,

1427
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:54,899
I hope her date's going well.

1428
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,106
Oh, yeah, I forgot to check my phone!

1429
00:52:58,814 --> 00:53:00,064
And here’s our little go-getter.

1430
00:53:01,396 --> 00:53:03,979
Melanie. Cute Girl Scout, huh?

1431
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:05,021
Yeah.

1432
00:53:05,022 --> 00:53:07,852
Oh, so cute.

1433
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:10,727
Aw...

1434
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:12,393
[Anna]: Yeah.

1435
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:13,976
Isn't she beautiful?

1436
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:17,350
Yeah, she is.

1437
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,097
Uh, well, no "help me" text from Jules,

1438
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:26,347
so I guess her date’s going pretty well.

1439
00:53:26,388 --> 00:53:27,721
Think both of our daughters

1440
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:28,971
are having a successful night.

1441
00:53:29,845 --> 00:53:31,887
Hey, Dad, how about some pick up?

1442
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:33,635
You bet. Damon?

1443
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,052
I'm in.

1444
00:53:35,093 --> 00:53:38,800
Yeah, let's go.B-Ball.

1445
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:41,258
Yeah!

1446
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,756
Oh, nice!

1447
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:49,714
Oh, oh, oh!

1448
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,877
Cold drinks and cookies when you're ready.

1449
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:03,293
Oh... hi.

1450
00:54:03,335 --> 00:54:04,709
Mom, why did you invite Rob over

1451
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:07,332
when you know it’s taco night?

1452
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:08,333
Well, he's always liked

1453
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:10,041
coming over in the past before,

1454
00:54:10,082 --> 00:54:11,457
so I just thought...

1455
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,373
You thought what?

1456
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:14,039
That maybe we’d get back together?

Are you sure?

1637
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,278
Jules, I know his type.

1638
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,235
He says he's searching,
but he's damaged goods,

1639
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:05,526
and he would bounce faster than I would.

1640
01:03:05,568 --> 01:03:06,942
Did he kiss you back?

1641
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:08,775
Yeah, I think so.

1642
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:09,691
See?

1643
01:03:09,732 --> 01:03:12,023
Then you won't know unless you ask him.

1644
01:03:12,065 --> 01:03:14,606
You want me to ask him to marry me?

1645
01:03:14,648 --> 01:03:15,939
[laughs]

1646
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:19,312
You're the one who's
always been put on the spot.

1647
01:03:19,313 --> 01:03:21,937
Maybe it's time to put the
shoe on the other foot?

1648
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:26,519
So she kissed you,

1649
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:27,768
and now she won't return your calls?

1650
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:28,810
Sounds to me like you were right,

1651
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:29,892
and she's the one with the problem.

1652
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:31,059
I don't know.

1653
01:03:31,101 --> 01:03:33,475
She's amazing in every other way...

1654
01:03:34,308 --> 01:03:35,432
and that kiss was...

1655
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:37,307
Was what?

1656
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:39,597
You know, that kind of kiss

1657
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:41,014
where the music just stops and...

1658
01:03:41,056 --> 01:03:43,013
You watching Rom-coms in your PJs,

1659
01:03:43,055 --> 01:03:44,179
eating ice cream?

1660
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:45,346
Of course not.

1661
01:03:55,717 --> 01:03:56,966
Who's that?

1662
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,800
[Damon]: Fiancé number three.

1663
01:03:59,966 --> 01:04:01,424
[Will]: That's why you should bail,

1664
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:03,090
before you become casualty number four.

1665
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:04,798
Come on, I’ll buy you a taco.

1666
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,129
[Mel]: Great job, Heather.

1667
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:15,669
Mia, that is some seriously
beautiful bead work.

1668
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,669
You definitely deserve this.

1669
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:21,291
Avery,

1670
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:25,166
you have light in your
feet and in your heart.

1671
01:04:25,207 --> 01:04:26,416
Don't ever forget that.

1672
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:31,081
Mm? Oh, I have it right here.

1673
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:34,162
Me?

1674
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:39,411
For you.

1675
01:04:39,452 --> 01:04:40,951
What is this?

1676
01:04:40,952 --> 01:04:42,244
The Leadership badge you wanted.

1677
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:45,700
Thank you.

1678
01:04:48,658 --> 01:04:50,657
Okay, it's time to say goodbye,

1679
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:52,407
so let's close our eyes and make a wish.

1680
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:05,652
Okay!

1681
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,318
Have a great night, everyone,

1682
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,609
and again, good job today!

1683
01:05:09,651 --> 01:05:10,775
[Damon]: Bye, guys!

1684
01:05:10,817 --> 01:05:13,024
[cheering, chatter]

1685
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:14,066
-Bye!-Bye!

1686
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:15,066
Bye!

1687
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:16,524
Bye, Avery!

1688
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:21,147
That was really nice of you.

1689
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:25,062
Well, you've been a really
great volunteer, so...

1690
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,269
Mel, I was...

1691
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:29,769
uh...

1692
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:31,227
I was wondering about the other day.

1693
01:05:32,476 --> 01:05:34,766
Right, of course.

1694
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:36,766
Again, I am so sorry about that.

1695
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,974
Oh, no, it's...

1696
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,264
it's okay.

1697
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:42,430
You've got a lot going on,

1698
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,972
and...

1699
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:46,971
you don't have to worry

1700
01:05:47,013 --> 01:05:47,971
because I don't want to
add to that confusion.

1701
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:50,929
I promise, I'll leave you alone.

1702
01:05:53,011 --> 01:05:54,968
Marry me!

1703
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:57,510
Excuse me?

1704
01:05:57,551 --> 01:06:00,592
[laughs]I know that sounds crazy,

1705
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:02,257
especially after everything I said,

1706
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,715
but...

1707
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:06,756
this is different.

1708
01:06:06,757 --> 01:06:07,714
I know it is,

1709
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,547
and I wanted to be sure next time,

1710
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:11,546
so...

1711
01:06:11,588 --> 01:06:13,962
will you marry me?

1712
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:16,836
Uh...

1713
01:06:19,169 --> 01:06:21,918
Oh, my gosh, I've seen that face before.

1714
01:06:22,918 --> 01:06:23,834
It's mine.

1715
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:26,125
It's my face.

1716
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:27,374
So I get it,

1717
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,081
and please, don't feel
pressured into saying yes,

1718
01:06:30,082 --> 01:06:33,580
because there's no one around,

1719
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:34,997
so we can just walk away and
pretend this never happened.

1720
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,580
Mel, wait. Uh, wait.

1721
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:41,162
I'm just speechless

1722
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:43,494
because I can't believe you
knew what my wish was.

1723
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:47,659
You.

1724
01:06:49,533 --> 01:06:50,867
I wished for you.

1725
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,157
Does that mean...?

1726
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:55,531
Yes.

1727
01:06:55,573 --> 01:06:56,947
Yes?

1728
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:58,489
Yes, I will marry you.

1729
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,155
[laughs]

1730
01:07:00,197 --> 01:07:01,237
I mean, are you sure?

1731
01:07:01,238 --> 01:07:02,154
Because if you need more time, I will...

1732
01:07:08,194 --> 01:07:09,527
Yes.

1733
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:10,610
[laughs]

1734
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,356
You proposed?

1735
01:07:21,398 --> 01:07:22,897
I did.

1736
01:07:22,898 --> 01:07:24,481
Isn't it great?

1737
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:26,812
Hey, let's give cred for where it's due.

1738
01:07:26,854 --> 01:07:28,520
It was my idea.

1739
01:07:28,562 --> 01:07:30,353
Of course it was.

1740
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:32,519
Are you sure about this, Melanie?

1741
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:36,059
I mean, it just seems all really impulsive.

1742
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,558
That's the thing.

1743
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:39,434
I don't have to wait for him to grow on me

1744
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:40,725
because I know that I love him,

1745
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:41,766
and I promise you,

1746
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:42,890
I would not put you through this again

1747
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,556
if I wasn't sure.

1748
01:07:44,557 --> 01:07:48,055
Well, congratulations, Roo.

1749
01:07:48,056 --> 01:07:49,056
So what do you think, Mom?

1750
01:07:49,057 --> 01:07:50,387
Will you help me plan the wedding?

1751
01:07:50,388 --> 01:07:52,721
Because I want everything to
be absolutely perfect.

1752
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,137
Really?

1753
01:07:55,178 --> 01:07:57,261
In the past, you haven't
wanted to make a big deal.

1754
01:07:57,303 --> 01:08:00,052
I know, but this is different.

1755
01:08:00,093 --> 01:08:02,759
He's the one. He really is The One.

1756
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:06,175
You hear this, Gord?

1757
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:07,215
We're planning a wedding!

1758
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:08,507
[chuckles]

1759
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:10,547
Does that mean we can stop planning
the anniversary party?

1760
01:08:10,548 --> 01:08:12,298
Dad!

1761
01:08:14,713 --> 01:08:15,963
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1762
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:18,878
[cheering]

1763
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:20,627
Good game, man.

1764
01:08:20,669 --> 01:08:21,669
Whoo!

1765
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:22,711
I don't believe it.

1766
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:24,835
Well, believe it, 'cause it's happening.

1767
01:08:24,877 --> 01:08:26,876
Wow. Talk about a slam dunk.

1768
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,541
You sure about this wedding, buddy?

1769
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:32,082
I mean, because you bailed on the bet,

1770
01:08:32,124 --> 01:08:34,039
you don't have to go through with it.

1771
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,956
I'm sure,

1772
01:08:34,998 --> 01:08:37,039
and this has nothing to do with the bet.

1773
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,830
I wanted to say yes.

1774
01:08:38,872 --> 01:08:41,787
Yeah, but you've still got to say "I do."

1775
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:44,287
Trust me, it's pretty scary up there.

1776
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,119
I sweated right through my blazer.

1777
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:48,077
Yeah, well, it doesn't phase me.

1778
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:49,201
You know why?

1779
01:08:50,701 --> 01:08:51,992
Because I love her...

1780
01:08:52,034 --> 01:08:53,908
in... you know, in that way.

1781
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,283
What way?

1782
01:08:55,325 --> 01:08:56,283
In that, uh...

1783
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:58,365
"I feel so lucky to have met her,

1784
01:08:58,407 --> 01:08:59,823
and I can't wait to
see what tomorrow brings,"

1785
01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:00,823
kind of way.

1786
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:01,947
[sniffling]

1787
01:09:03,114 --> 01:09:04,695
I'm sorry. It's just...

1788
01:09:04,696 --> 01:09:06,154
I mean, who would have
thought by you making a bet

1789
01:09:06,195 --> 01:09:07,612
to get her to say yes,

1790
01:09:07,653 --> 01:09:09,361
you'd end up being the one proposed to...

1791
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:11,027
but it doesn't change the
fact that you bailed,

1792
01:09:11,028 --> 01:09:12,069
right?

1793
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:13,610
Don't worry,

1794
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:16,109
I'll make magic with that
Bran Buddies account.

1795
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:18,858
My man.

1796
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:21,441
[Fred]: Juicy Soda’s my account.

1797
01:09:24,481 --> 01:09:25,688
[Jules]: Wow.

1798
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:28,355
How long have you been
hiding your Choco Pops addiction?

1799
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,646
They're for Damon.

1800
01:09:29,688 --> 01:09:30,688
He and his mom

1801
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:31,937
used to eat them
for breakfast every morning,

1802
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:32,979
so I thought it’d be nice

1803
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:34,811
to add them to his grocery list.

1804
01:09:34,853 --> 01:09:36,561
What are you going to do with your dresses?

1805
01:09:36,602 --> 01:09:38,060
You're not going to wear
one of those, are you?

1806
01:09:38,102 --> 01:09:39,517
No, of course not.

1807
01:09:39,518 --> 01:09:40,767
I'm going to find the
perfect dress this time,

1808
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,350
and these, I'm going to give to charity,

1809
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:47,016
except, I don't know...

1810
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,473
maybe I'll keep this.

1811
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:50,514
Have you told Rob?

1812
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:52,847
I'm going to stop over and see him

1813
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:54,013
on my way to Damon.

1814
01:09:55,346 --> 01:09:56,429
[doorbell rings]

1815
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:00,927
Rob!

1816
01:10:00,969 --> 01:10:01,844
Mel.

1817
01:10:01,885 --> 01:10:04,884
I was just on my way to see you.

1818
01:10:06,842 --> 01:10:08,050
Is that the one you plan on wearing

1819
01:10:08,092 --> 01:10:09,008
when you marry Damon?

1820
01:10:09,049 --> 01:10:10,757
What? No, of course not...

1821
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,756
I'm sorry, how did you...?

1822
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:14,798
I heard, Mel.

1823
01:10:15,714 --> 01:10:16,880
Rob, I'm so sorry.

1824
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:18,297
I was just about to go tell you.

1825
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:19,629
It was a bet, Mel.

1826
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:20,671
What?

1827
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:22,669
He bet on you,

1828
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,961
but instead of this watch,

1829
01:10:24,003 --> 01:10:25,668
the wager was some account at work.

1830
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:29,001
You say "yes" to his proposal, and he wins.

1831
01:10:29,002 --> 01:10:31,292
Rob, if this is your way of
trying to get me back

1832
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:32,458
and break it off with Damon,

1833
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,500
then you're not doing a...

1834
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:34,832
I know you asked him, Mel,

1835
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,416
because at the basketball court,

1836
01:10:36,457 --> 01:10:37,497
they were all talking

1837
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:39,123
about what a slam dunk your proposal was.

1838
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:43,371
Okay, it's time for you to go now, Rob.

1839
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,911
He rolled the dice on you, Mel,

1840
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,911
and he won.

1841
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:51,993
Mel.

1842
01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:53,451
Mel!

1843
01:10:56,742 --> 01:10:57,783
Hey!

1844
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:58,992
Does the dress shop know you
left with that on?

1845
01:10:59,032 --> 01:11:02,322
Ooh, were you thinking a
big wedding or small?

1846
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:03,739
'Cause my mom's already calling relatives.

1847
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:06,989
That depends. What did you bet on?

1848
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:10,986
Or did the wedding not even matter,

1849
01:11:10,987 --> 01:11:12,736
and it was just about getting me to say yes?

1850
01:11:12,778 --> 01:11:14,485
I don't know what you're talking about.

1851
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:16,152
I know about the bet, Damon.

1852
01:11:18,818 --> 01:11:20,942
Mel, it wasn't like that.

1853
01:11:20,984 --> 01:11:22,566
Oh, I know...

1854
01:11:22,608 --> 01:11:24,982
because I'm the one that proposed to you.

1855
01:11:24,983 --> 01:11:26,023
So what?

1856
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:27,398
Did that just raise the stakes or something?

1857
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:28,523
No, I called it off.

1858
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:30,273
I called the bet off before you asked.

1859
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:32,980
Mel, I was falling in love with you.

1860
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:34,729
I didn't want it to be about a bet.

1861
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:38,436
What's the first law in the Scouts, Damon?

1862
01:11:40,061 --> 01:11:41,601
A Scout is trustworthy.

1863
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,512
Wow...

1864
01:12:00,553 --> 01:12:02,886
This is going to be quite a party.

1865
01:12:02,928 --> 01:12:05,302
Yes, it is.

1866
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:09,009
You know, I joke,

1867
01:12:09,051 --> 01:12:11,384
but I'd have a party for a hundred people

1868
01:12:11,425 --> 01:12:12,675
if it'd make your mother happy,

1869
01:12:12,716 --> 01:12:15,257
because when I saw her working that grill

1870
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:16,632
at the street fair,

1871
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:20,005
I knew she had to be my wife.

1872
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:23,255
The only problem was, so did my buddy.

1873
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:24,462
Frank Hendersen...

1874
01:12:24,504 --> 01:12:27,670
yeah, he was something.

1875
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:28,961
Handsome, a doctor...

1876
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:31,959
So I asked him. I said,
"Frank, give me a chance."

1877
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,209
He said, "Sure, go for it...

1878
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:39,666
"but if you lose,

1879
01:12:39,707 --> 01:12:41,165
it's anyone's game."

1880
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:42,373
So, needless to say,

1881
01:12:42,414 --> 01:12:44,956
I spent the next month trying to outdo Frank

1882
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:46,620
for your mother's attention.

1883
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:47,579
Did mom know?

1884
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:49,619
You know, I'm not sure...

1885
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,452
but the point is,

1886
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:54,744
the circumstances in which you meet someone,

1887
01:12:54,786 --> 01:12:56,618
or fall in love...

1888
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,076
it really doesn't change how
you feel about them,

1889
01:12:59,117 --> 01:13:02,158
because when you know it’s right,

1890
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,574
it's right,

1891
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:04,907
and when it's not...

1892
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:06,657
we move on.

1893
01:13:06,698 --> 01:13:08,948
Thanks, Dad.

1894
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:13,029
I love you.

1895
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:14,654
I love you, too.

1896
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:34,397
Are you sure about this?

1897
01:13:34,438 --> 01:13:37,437
Because there’s no going back.

1898
01:13:40,686 --> 01:13:42,810
Yeah, I'm sure.

1899
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:48,017
Okay. Bye.

1900
01:13:48,059 --> 01:13:49,100
Bye.

1901
01:14:00,096 --> 01:14:01,929
Hey, Rob.

1902
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:04,095
Hey.

1903
01:14:04,137 --> 01:14:05,094
You all right?

1904
01:14:05,095 --> 01:14:07,552
Yeah, I will be.

1905
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:11,425
Look, Mel, I didn't
enjoy having to tell you.

1906
01:14:11,426 --> 01:14:13,383
I just figured you should know...

1907
01:14:13,425 --> 01:14:14,759
whether it meant you came back to me or not.

1908
01:14:16,424 --> 01:14:17,674
Have you?

1909
01:14:17,716 --> 01:14:19,924
No, Rob, I haven't.

1910
01:14:20,881 --> 01:14:22,422
You deserve somebody
who’s going to love you back

1911
01:14:22,464 --> 01:14:25,130
just as much as you love them.

1912
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,207
Hey, Mel?

1913
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:45,332
Despite the bet...

1914
01:14:45,373 --> 01:14:46,914
it's really not that unbelievable

1915
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,830
to think Damon fell in love with you.

1916
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,825
What do we think about when
we think about home?

1917
01:15:02,867 --> 01:15:04,907
Warmth.

1918
01:15:04,908 --> 01:15:06,824
Family.

1919
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:07,990
Comfort.

1920
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:11,239
That's what Bran Buddies are.

1921
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:14,654
They are homegrown goodness.

1922
01:15:14,696 --> 01:15:18,196
That's your brand... a homegrown company

1923
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:21,028
made with homegrown love.

1924
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,192
Out of everyone on my team,
I knew it would be you

1925
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:28,108
to brand those tasteless pieces
of cardboard,

1926
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:30,398
and to show my appreciation,

1927
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:32,398
I am putting you on the Juicy team...

1928
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,397
but before you say thank you,

1929
01:15:34,398 --> 01:15:36,106
I hear they’re having a sponsored luau,

1930
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:37,314
and you know what that means.

1931
01:15:38,897 --> 01:15:40,521
Hula girls, Damon.

1932
01:15:40,563 --> 01:15:41,604
Great. Thanks.

1933
01:15:41,645 --> 01:15:42,728
Don't mention it.

1934
01:15:42,729 --> 01:15:45,352
How about you and I go grab a taco,

1935
01:15:45,394 --> 01:15:46,603
shoot some hoop?

1936
01:15:46,644 --> 01:15:48,476
You know, I think I'm
just going to head home.

1937
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:50,393
I'll see you tomorrow.

1938
01:16:06,304 --> 01:16:07,553
Here, let me help you with that.

1939
01:16:07,554 --> 01:16:10,261
Damon! Thank you.

1940
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:12,094
That's a lot of cookies.

1941
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:14,217
Yeah, shopping for the anniversary party.

1942
01:16:14,218 --> 01:16:15,884
Right.

1943
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:17,049
30 years.

1944
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,841
Mm-hmm.

1945
01:16:18,883 --> 01:16:20,591
How's Melanie?

1946
01:16:20,632 --> 01:16:22,007
Miserable.

1947
01:16:24,214 --> 01:16:26,881
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Banning.

1948
01:16:26,922 --> 01:16:29,880
I should never have placed that bet.

1949
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:31,296
Once I got to know Mel,

1950
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,253
I was...

1951
01:16:33,295 --> 01:16:35,169
I was embarrassed.

1952
01:16:35,211 --> 01:16:36,210
It was selfish.

1953
01:16:36,252 --> 01:16:37,626
Maybe.

1954
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:39,959
Let me ask you this.

1955
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:42,750
Without placing it, would
you have met Melanie?

1956
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,666
No, probably not.

1957
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:47,498
Then it was meant to be.

1958
01:16:48,873 --> 01:16:50,371
That night you came over...

1959
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:52,496
I know Melanie insisted it was not a date,

1960
01:16:52,538 --> 01:16:54,288
but I know my daughter.

1961
01:16:54,329 --> 01:16:55,413
Mel loves you...

1962
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,535
so bet or no bet,

1963
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:01,702
I can see that you love her.

1964
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:03,577
I do.

1965
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:06,492
I do love her.

1966
01:17:07,992 --> 01:17:08,867
There's no way

1967
01:17:08,908 --> 01:17:10,657
I could convince her of that now.

1968
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:11,699
Of course there is.

1969
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,447
Do the one thing she doubts the most.

1970
01:17:17,697 --> 01:17:18,779
Marry her.

1971
01:17:39,523 --> 01:17:42,729
[Jules]: Guests are arriving!

1972
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:43,896
I am getting excited.

1973
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:45,146
Me too.

1974
01:17:45,187 --> 01:17:48,144
Wow, everything looks perfect.

1975
01:17:48,186 --> 01:17:49,351
I think we're ready.

1976
01:17:49,352 --> 01:17:52,476
Oh, I've got to go. My date is here.

1977
01:17:52,518 --> 01:17:54,350
Oh, he must really like you

1978
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:56,141
to come to a family event like this.

1979
01:17:56,183 --> 01:17:57,058
You think so?

1980
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,141
Jules, all weddings freak men out,

1981
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:00,391
even wedding anniversaries,

1982
01:18:00,432 --> 01:18:01,557
so yeah, he likes you.

1983
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:03,181
[squeals] Yes!

1984
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:06,179
Mom, you look amazing!

1985
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:07,346
Thank you! So do you.

1986
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:08,846
Thank you.

1987
01:18:08,887 --> 01:18:10,178
Let's get this show started.

1988
01:18:10,179 --> 01:18:11,262
Let's do it.

1989
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:16,677
[Minister]: Do you, Gordon Banning,

1990
01:18:16,718 --> 01:18:19,217
give to Anna a new promise

1991
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:21,259
to continue loving her

1992
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,966
with the same heart that has
loved her for 30 years,

1993
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:25,007
from now to eternity?

1994
01:18:25,965 --> 01:18:27,048
I do.

1995
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,256
[Minister]: Do you, Anna Banning,

1996
01:18:29,297 --> 01:18:31,130
give to Gordon a new promise

1997
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:32,296
to continue loving him

1998
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:35,254
from the heart that has
loved him for 30 years,

1999
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:37,628
from now to eternity?

2000
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,545
I do.

2001
01:18:38,585 --> 01:18:40,752
[Minister]: Well then, one more time,

2002
01:18:40,794 --> 01:18:42,626
let's seal it with a kiss.

2003
01:18:43,709 --> 01:18:44,917
[applause]

2004
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:46,042
Yay!

2005
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:50,331
-So beautiful!-Thanks, sweetie.

2006
01:18:50,332 --> 01:18:51,540
Congratulations.

2007
01:18:53,498 --> 01:18:54,996
Here, Mom.

2008
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:55,871
You get to throw it again.

2009
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:58,079
Actually, sweetheart,

2010
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,328
you might want to hold onto that.

2011
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,118
You invited him?

2012
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:11,117
I did.

2013
01:19:18,322 --> 01:19:19,155
Mel...

2014
01:19:19,197 --> 01:19:20,239
Mel, just give me a chance.

2015
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,238
A chance to what?

2016
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:23,695
Explain how you used me?

2017
01:19:23,737 --> 01:19:24,654
No, not here.

2018
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:27,653
Not at my parents' wedding anniversary.

2019
01:19:27,694 --> 01:19:29,111
Well, then how about at our wedding?

2020
01:19:29,152 --> 01:19:30,027
What?

2021
01:19:31,026 --> 01:19:32,692
I know making that bet was
a lousy thing to do,

2022
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,650
but if I hadn't...

2023
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:36,067
I never would have met you,

2024
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:37,608
so...

2025
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:38,981
if you asked me if I'd do it again?

2026
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:39,940
Yeah.

2027
01:19:39,981 --> 01:19:41,981
Yeah, I would...

2028
01:19:43,272 --> 01:19:44,480
because before I met you,

2029
01:19:44,522 --> 01:19:47,896
I never could have seen
myself walking down that aisle.

2030
01:19:47,938 --> 01:19:50,520
You made me believe in happily ever after.

2031
01:19:52,894 --> 01:19:55,519
I love you, Mel.

2032
01:19:57,142 --> 01:19:59,474
I just...

2033
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:02,099
I hope you still feel the same way.

2034
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:06,389
Melanie Banning...

2035
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:11,222
Will you marry me?

2036
01:20:11,262 --> 01:20:12,970
Oh, my gosh.

2037
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,345
Hi!

2038
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:18,885
You invited my Scouts?

2039
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:20,802
I figured what's a
wedding without flower girls?

2040
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:27,799
Um...

2041
01:20:28,882 --> 01:20:30,090
Hey, honestly,

2042
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:31,964
it's not my intention to
make you feel any pressure,

2043
01:20:32,006 --> 01:20:33,713
so if the answer is no...

2044
01:20:33,755 --> 01:20:35,880
I understand.

2045
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:36,921
I just wanted to show you

2046
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:39,462
how committed I am to you,

2047
01:20:39,504 --> 01:20:41,377
and that I would be honored

2048
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,211
to marry you right here...

2049
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:44,335
right now.

2050
01:20:46,001 --> 01:20:47,084
I...

2051
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,167
I get it. You're not feeling it.

2052
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:50,458
Yes.

2053
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:55,622
I'm sorry, did you say...?

2054
01:20:55,623 --> 01:20:57,498
Yes!

2055
01:20:57,539 --> 01:20:58,497
Yes?

2056
01:20:58,538 --> 01:21:00,121
I said yes.

2057

[cheering, clapping]

2058
01:21:10,701 --> 01:21:11,784
Thank you.

2060
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:21,364
You got this, Mel?

2061
01:21:21,406 --> 01:21:22,447
Yeah.

2062

2064
01:21:49,688 --> 01:21:52,270
Thanks, Avery.

2065
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:58,393
In the spirit of Gordon and
Anna's anniversary...

2066
01:21:58,435 --> 01:21:59,726
do you, Damon Hadley,

2067
01:21:59,768 --> 01:22:00,726
give to Melanie

2068
01:22:00,768 --> 01:22:03,432
a promise to love her with all your heart

2069
01:22:03,433 --> 01:22:04,766
from now to eternity?

2070
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:06,224
I do.

2071
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:09,182
[Minister]: And do you, Melanie Banning,

2072
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:10,598
give to Damon

2073
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,056
a promise to love him with all your heart

2074
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,763
from now to eternity?

2075
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:19,303
I do.

2076
01:22:19,344 --> 01:22:21,094
[Minister]: I pronounce
you husband and wife.

2077
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,469
You may kiss the bride.

2079
01:22:30,382 --> 01:22:31,757
Yay!

2080
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:35,465
We did it!

2081
01:22:35,505 --> 01:22:37,422
Congratulations.

2082

Who wants cake? Who wants cake?

2083
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:53,000
So, we took the plunge.

2084
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:54,332
Head first.

2085
01:22:56,498 --> 01:22:57,540
Are you sure?

2086
01:22:57,582 --> 01:22:59,747
I am.

2087
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:00,873
Scout's honor.

2088
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:03,705
I love you, Melanie.
