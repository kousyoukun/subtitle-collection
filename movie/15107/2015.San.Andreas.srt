1
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:27,064
聖費爾南多谷 洛杉磯16英里以北

2
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,096
# ...你的眼神 #
...look in your eye

3
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:38,079
# 而我有著紅唇和那些優雅 都是你所愛的 #
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

4
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,050
# 每當我們橫衝直撞 卻總能和好如初 #
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

5
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,017
# 因為我們永遠如經典般存在 #
'Cause we never go out of style

6
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:48,074
# 我們永不過時 #
We never go out of style

7
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:53,048
# 你留著長髮 梳著大背頭 穿著白色T恤 #
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt

8
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:58,078
# 而我有著好女孩的樣子 穿著緊身裙 #
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

9
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,079
# 每當我們橫衝直撞 卻總能和好如初 #
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
真是笑死我了 妹子.. 你和喬什是怎麼回事

11
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,039
# 因為我們永遠如經典般存在 #
'Cause we never go out of style

12
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,012
# 我們永不過時 #
We never go out of style

13
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,096
啊
Aah!

14
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,035
救命
Help!

15
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:29,054
我知道你們都隸屬於駐紮在阿富汗巴格拉姆
So, uh, I understand that you all were part

16
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:32,071
軍事基地的五十八號救援分隊
of the fifty-eighth rescue squadron staged over at bagram

17
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:35,034
執行空中巡邏營救任務
in Afghanistan for combat search and rescue.

18
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:37,038
是的 女士 去過兩次
Yes, ma'am. Two tours.

19
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,031
你們現在仍然是搭檔嗎
And you're still flying together?

20
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:40,075
是的 我們感情都挺好的 像一家人一樣
Yeah, we all got pretty tight over there. Wouldn't break up the family.

21
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:43,022
兄弟 我們像是一家的嗎
Dude, do we look like family?

22
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,042
一點點吧
A little.

23
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,012
那麼 在阿富汗時的救援
So, what's the biggest difference

24
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:49,052
和在這堛漱u作有什麼不同嗎
between rescuing over there and what you do here?

25
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,046
這堣ㄦ|吃槍子兒
Not getting shot at.

26
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:54,006
你真是個有趣的傢伙
You're a funny guy.

27
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:56,096
是吧 一般般啦
Yeah. Not exactly.

28
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:58,063
呃 蓋恩斯首長
Um... chief Gaines?

29
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:01,080
據我所知在阿富汗和洛杉磯消防局任期間
I'm told that between Afghanistan and LAFD,

30
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,027
你拯救了超過六百餘人的生命
you have over six hundred documented rescues.

31
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,071
這真讓人印象深刻
That's, uh...pretty impressive.

32
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:10,018
本職工作而已 女士
Just doin' my job, ma'am.

絕對服從命令
Go where they tell me to go.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,042
很不錯 你可以停止拍攝了
That's great. You can cut there.

35
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:22,073
她在那
There she is.

36
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:29,010
峽谷太窄了
Looks pretty tight.

37
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,090
把她拉上來
Take her up.

38
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,081
風向不斷在變化
Winds are variable.

39
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,041
在270度到300度間搖擺
Two-seven-zero to three-zero-zero.

40
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,082
風速由十節上升為十五節
Ten knots gusting to fifteen.

總部 把她的手機轉到我們這
Metro, connect her cell to our sat phone.

47
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:06,023
直升機五號 你們已經連上了

54
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:22,085
天哪 車子正在下滑
Oh, my God! The car is sliding.

55
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:24,079
納塔莉 我需要你保持冷靜 親愛的

We show you one plus one five playtime.

60
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,060
兄弟 我可沒看到能從哪進去
Man, I don't see a way in.

61
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,094
我們得橫向切入
We're gonna tip the hat.

62
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:44,067
橫向切入嗎
Tip the hat?

63
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:48,014
是啊 你最好抓緊了
Yeah. You might wanna hold on to somethin'.

64
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,001
出發
Here we go.

好了 開工了 夥計們
All right. Tuck 'em in, boys.

71
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,097
喬比 別用吊籃
Joby, forget the basket.

72
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:22,021
我們這次得用上雙重固定
We gotta do a double tie-in on this one.

73
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:24,051
車子要是掉下去了 她也就完了
That car goes, so does she.

74
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:31,012
門開了
Door's open.

75
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,096
拿上這個
Get this.

繩索固定
Hookin' up.

已經就位了
On the skid.

78
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,047
我們最多只有五分鐘
We got five minutes max.

79
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:52,004
超過五分鐘會怎樣
What happens in five minutes?

80
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,028
沒什麼 只不過引擎會熄火
It's no big deal. Just engine failure.

81
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:57,008
好在我只要三分鐘
Good thing I only need three.

82
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:07,056
- 謝天謝地 - 不 不 納塔莉 別...
- Oh, thank God. - No, no! Natalie, do not...

83
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,012
天哪 天哪 把我救出去
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Get me out of here.

84
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,006
納塔莉 我需要你一動不動地待著
Natalie, I need you to stay perfectly still.

85
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,066
- 我要先穩定住汽車 好嗎 - 快點 求你了
- I have to stabilize the car, okay? - Hurry, please.

86
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:25,007
車子固定好了
Car secured.

87
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:34,018
掛住了
Got it.

88
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:41,032
怎麼回事
What the hell?

89
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:43,039
該死
Shit.

90
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,013
哇 哇

天哪 喬比被卡住了
Jesus. Joby's pinned!

93
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,074
啊 該死的
Ah, goddamn it.

94
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:07,011
喬比 我現在下來
Joby, I'm comin' down.

95
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,035
哈里森 你來駕駛 馬庫斯 給我裝上安全繩
Harrison, you're flyin'. Marcus, rig me a rope.

96
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,042
- 移交駕駛權 - 收到

- 隨時切斷繩子 - 收到
- Be ready to cut. - Roger that.

99
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,030
鉤上了
Hooked up.

100
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,014
出艙門
Out the door.

101
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:31,057
我準備好了
Ray's clear.

102
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:42,062
納塔莉 別擔心 我會把你救出...
Natalie, don't you worry. I'm gonna get you outta...

103
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:44,072
啊
Aaah!

104
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:50,039
直升機撐不住了
This thing isn't gonna hold!

105
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,080
雷 紅色警報 我們要墜機了
Ray, we are in the red! We are going to crash!

106
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,016
納塔莉 我們現在就出去
Natalie, we are going now!

107
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:00,050
我抓住你了
I got you.

108
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,091
切繩子 喬比 快甩開
Cut it! Joby, swing!

109
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,052
太好了
Yeah!

110
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:22,079
我們現在送你回家怎麼樣
What do we say we get you home now.

111
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,076
我覺得這主意實在不錯
I think that's a really good idea.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,064
加州理工學院 加利福尼亞 帕薩迪納市

113
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:31,023
發生在日本的僊台地震被認為是
Now the sendai quake in Japan was considered to be

114
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:33,087
1900年以來最強的五大地震之一
one of the five strongest since 1900.

115
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,087
威力巨大 事實上
It was so powerful, in fact,

116
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:40,021
它將日本的本土移動了八英尺
that it moved the main island of Japan eight feet.

117
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:44,061
這僅僅是每年發生在全球範圍內
This is just one of the 1.3 million earthquakes

118
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:48,008
130萬起地震中的一次而已
that occur around the globe each year.

119
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:52,049
北美最大的一次地震發生於1964年
The largest ever recorded here in North America:

120
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,069
在阿拉斯加州的安克雷奇 有9.1級
Anchorage, Alaska, 1964. A 9.1.

121
00:09:57,073 --> 00:10:00,066
地震持續了有五分鐘
The earth shook for five straight minutes.

122
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,003
釋放出的能量
The energy release

123
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,080
相當於一千萬等量的原子彈
was the equivalent of ten million atom bombs

124
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,040
等同於在日本廣島投下的原子彈
the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.

125
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,064
但那不是史上記載最強的一次地震
And that's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded.

126
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:12,011
最強的一次是在四年前
No, the biggest was four years earlier

127
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,001
發生在智利南部的瓦爾迪維亞
off the coast of Valdivia in Southern Chile.

128
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,065
達到了9.5里氏震級
A 9.5 on the Richter scale.

129
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,048
就是那
Right there.

130
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:22,015
砰
Bam.

131
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:25,049
這次地震持續了十一分鐘
This quake lasted eleven minutes and spawned a Tsunami

132
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:28,072
引起了82英尺的海嘯 並將八千英里外的
eighty-two feet high that leveled hilo, Hawaii,

133
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,049
夏威夷西部夷為平地
eight thousand Miles away.

134
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:34,090
那可是八千英里之外啊
Eight thousand Miles away.

135
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,003
所以 嗯 正是因為地震有著
So, um, It's... It's mass destruction like this

136
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:41,070
如此之大的破壞性
that shows just how important

137
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,014
才顯示出我們的研究和工作有多重要
the research that we're doing here is,

138
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:47,041
因為我們要能夠預測地震
because we need to be able to predict these things.

139
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,024
對嗎 可以提前應對
Right? To plan and prepare for them.

140
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,001
- 這位女士 - 教授 您認為
- Yes, ma'am. - Professor, do you think

141
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:53,085
那樣的事情會發生在這媔
something that intense could happen here?

142
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,032
額 聖安第斯斷層
Well, the San Andreas fault

143
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,079
經過加利福尼亞附近
runs right up the spine of California.

144
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,039
兩個構造板塊的分界線
It's the demarcation line

145
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,032
近些年不斷的在移動著
between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving.

146
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:05,083
再加上大約150年才會發生一次
Well, and add to that the fact that It's supposed to happen

147
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,090
較為嚴重的地震
every one hundred and fifty years

148
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,007
而我們已經安穩一百多年
and we're about a hundred years overdue.

149
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:15,000
我想說 這不是會不會發生的問題
I'd say It's not a matter of If.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,091
而是何時會發生
It's a matter of when.

151
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,021
該死的 哥斯拉
Damn, Godzilla.

152
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,094
這次你們又對直升機做了什麼
What the hell did you do to her this time?

153
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:24,068
和轎車玩了個小小的拔河比賽而已
Played a little tug of war with a car.

154
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:27,001
你要多久能把它修好
How soon before you get her fixed?

155
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,045
我今天會給馬丁內斯打電話的
I'll call Martinez today.

156
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:31,005
乾脆給你換件新的算了
Get a new one sent over to maintenance.

157
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:33,052
埃爾金 別走太快 小心你的屁股
Elgin, you move any faster, you're gonna break that hip.

158
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,083
哈里森說你要和佈雷克一起休息幾天
Harrison said you're taking off with Blake for a few days.

159
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,099
對 明天就走
Yeah. Leavin' tomorrow.

160
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,036
開車送她回去上學
Driving her back up to school.

161
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,040
週末排球隊第一場比賽就開始了
Volleyball team has their first game this weekend,

162
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,010
所以我想我們可以在海岸上玩一圈 露個營
so I figured we'd cruise up the coast. Do a little campin'.

163
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,060
夥計 我真不敢相信她已經上大學了
Dude, I can't believe she's in college already.

164
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,067
我懂 時光飛逝 兄弟
I know. Too fast, brother.

165
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,034
- 我等會來找你 - 好的 夥計
- I'll catch you inside. - All right, man.

166
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:01,098
勞倫斯 你快看看這個
Lawrence, I gotta show you something.

167
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,092
什麼 啊 小事情
Yeah? Aha. Easy. Easy.

168
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:05,089
我們剛剛發現了一個罕見的低級地震群
Now, we got a rare low-level seismic swarm

169
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,002
在內華達州的法爾科
out in Falco, Nevada.

170
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,006
24小時之內發生了23次小地震
Twenty-three small quakes, all tiny.

171
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,026
都很小 震級在2.0級到2.6級
2.0 to 2.6 in the last twenty-four hours.

172
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,096
好吧 內華達州的法爾科在哪啊
Okay. Where the hell is Falco, Nevada?

173
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:15,020
維加斯東南大約35英里
Thirty-five Miles southeast of Vegas,

174
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,023
或許離胡佛水壩五英里
maybe five Miles from the hoover dam.

175
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,030
好吧
Right.

176
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,030
那堥S有斷層啊
There aren't any faults out there.

177
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,050
不包括未知的啊
Any known faults.

178
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,061
如果我們現在過去 而那些迷你的地震還在持續的話
Now, If we get there while the mini quakes continue,

179
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:26,067
就可以測試我們的理論了
we can test our theory.

180
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:29,068
如果在地震前磁脈衝率上升的話
And If the magnetic pulse rate goes up before the quakes...

181
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:30,088
那麼我們可以提前預測
Then we're predicting them.

182
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:33,011
我們可以提前預測
Then we are predicting them.

183
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:36,012
好了 讓我們一探究竟吧
All right. Let's go check it out.

184
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,030
- 嗨 爸爸 - 嘿 親愛的
- Hi, dad. - Hey, sweetie.

185
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:58,087
我在想還有沒有地方放我的自行車
I was wondering If there was room for my bike.

186
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,031
我想我可以騎自行車去上課
I thought that I could ride it to class

187
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,038
這樣我就不用花錢買停車證了
and then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.

188
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:03,064
好主意啊
That's a great idea.

189
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,068
我敢肯定我可以找到方法搞定的
I'm sure I could figure out a way to fit it in.

190
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,078
好的 很好
All right, great.

191
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,095
嗯 我在媽媽這塈鉹ㄗ噾_匙
Um, I can't find the key to the lock at mom's,

192
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:11,035
可能是我落在化妝台左上角的抽屜堣F
so It's either in the top left drawer of my dresser

193
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,082
也可能在我衣櫃上面的粉紅鞋盒
or on top of the wardrobe in my pink shoe box.

194
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:15,089
好的 沒問題 我會找到的
Okay, no problem. I'll find it.

195
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,032
今天有計劃了嗎
Don't know If you have plans tonight,

196
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,079
我想帶你去吃晚餐
but I would love to take you to dinner.

197
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,086
你也可以把媽媽帶著一起
You could even invite your mom along.

198
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,046
- 會很有趣的 - 噢 謝了 老爸
- Could be fun. - Oh, thanks, dad.

199
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:26,047
但我們已經計劃和丹尼爾一起
But we already have plans with Daniel.

200
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,004
爸爸
Dad?

201
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,074
- 你還好嗎 - 當然 我沒事
- Are you okay? - Yeah, of course I am.

202
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:34,008
我好著呢 沒問題
Totally cool. No problem at all.

203
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:36,021
好的 那我們明天見吧
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

204
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,018
好的
Okay.

205
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,095
噢 別忘了我的自行車鑰匙
Oh, and don't forget the bike key.

206
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,001
不會忘的 放心
I won't. I got it.

207
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,018
再見 爸爸 愛你
Bye, dad. I love you.

208
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,062
我也愛你 寶貝
Okay. I love you, too, honey.

209
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:46,012
再見
Bye.

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
離婚協議書

211
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,031
快過來 小傢伙們 我們照張相
Come here, you guys. Let's take a picture.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
胡佛水壩 克拉克郡 內華達州

213
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:29,076
勞倫斯 真是不可思議
Lawrence, It's incredible.

214
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:32,009
這是自我們來這之後第三次迷你地震了
This is the third mini quake since we've been here.

215
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,096
磁脈衝率上升的速度
And the magnetic pulse rate has increased

216
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:35,000
比之前都快
before each one of them.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,026
我們找到規律了 朋友
We got a pattern, my friend.

218
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:40,077
是2.0級 我們真的預測到了
That was a 2.0. Our model's predictive.

219
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,074
哦 我們做到了 朋友 終於做到了
Oh! We got it right, man! Finally!

220
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,084
沒錯 我們成功了
Yep, we sure did.

221
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,051
噢 該死的
Oh, shit.

222
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:51,075
怎麼了
What's wrong?

223
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,012
脈衝率又一次飆升了 這次很強烈
Pulse rates are spikin' again. They're huge.

224
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,072
你開玩笑嗎
Are you serious?

225
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,099
基姆
Kim?

226
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:01,096
我們要遇到大地震了
We're about to have a major quake.

227
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,083
震級跳到7.1級了
It jumped to a 7.1!

228
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,073
我的天 基姆
Jesus, Kim!

229

快點離開那兒
Get the hell outta there!

230
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:23,041
所有人都快從大壩下去 快走 快
Everybody get off the dam! Move! Now! Now!

231
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,082
所有人都快點走 快點
Everybody off! Hurry up!

232

快到安全障礙後面來
Stay behind the barriers!

233
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:08,046
快點 快點 到安全障礙後面來
Come on! Come on! Come on! Stay behind the barriers!

234
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,090
基姆 快啊

240
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,078
別 別動
No! No!

241

把眼睛閉起來吧
Close your eyes.

242
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,021
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

243
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
洛根首長 內華達州大地震 緊急集合

244
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:01,037
內華達州南部今天發生強烈地震
The Southern part of Nevada was rocked today

245
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:03,010
地震專家稱之為
by what seismologists are calling

246
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,097
本地區發生過的最為強烈的一次地震
the most destructive earthquake ever reported in that area.

247
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:08,068
官方報道稱胡佛水壩已被完全摧毀
Officials are saying that hoover dam is a total loss.

248
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:12,005
哈瓦蘇湖城 尼德爾斯 布萊斯和勞克林
Lake Havasu city, needles, blythe and Laughlin

249
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:13,085
也遭受了重大損失
also suffered major damage.

250
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,005
來自洛杉磯的救援
Additional support from Los Angeles

251
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:17,072
包括洛杉磯消防隊的空中救援
including LAFD air rescue,

252
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,039
將會在24小時內抵達現場
is expected to begin arriving in the next 24 hours.

253
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,046
- 報道稱 損失總量為 - 嗨 爸爸
- Reports that the total loss... - Hi, dad.

254
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,073
嘿 親愛的
Hey, honey.

255
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:27,059
我們剛剛看到新聞了
We just saw the news.

256
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,020
我知道 我很抱歉

257
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,086
我們明天就要出發了
We're headin' out tomorrow.

258
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:33,013
沒關係 我知道的 這次太嚴重了 爸爸
No, I get it. This one's really bad, dad.

259
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,080
是啊 太可怕了
Yeah, this one's tough.

260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,094
在地震期間 地震的強度
Earthquakes can rise and fall in intensity

261
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,081
會隨著持續時間而有所增減
during their duration depending on the way...

262
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,094
- 嘿 - 嘿

這房子真不錯啊
Heck of a place you got here, man.

267
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,095
- 啊 謝謝 - 不客氣
- Ah, thank you. - Welcome.

268
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:54,049
那麼 嗯 爸爸明天就要出發去內華達州了
So, um... dad is heading to Nevada tomorrow.

269
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,042
發生這樣的事情真是可怕
Oh, It's terrible what happened.

270
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:58,019
在那兒要注意安全 好嗎
Please be safe over there, okay?

271
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:00,049
好的 我們會的 還有 寶貝 我保證我會補償你的
Yeah, we will. And I promise I'm gonna make it up to you, honey.

272
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,016
爸爸 真的沒關係的
Dad, It's really no problem.

273
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,090
我開車沒那麼糟的
The drive is not that bad.

274
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,007
等等 為什麼不讓我帶你過去呢
Wait. Why don't I take you up there.

275
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,024
我要飛舊金山參加個會儀
I'm flying up to San Francisco for a meeting.

276
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,077
然後我們可以一起去西雅圖
We can head up to Seattle right after.

277
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:12,017
還能給我個看你那排球賽的機會
It'll give me an opportunity to catch a volleyball game.

278
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:13,037
好主意
That's a good idea.

279
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:14,098
還可以讓你媽媽整理她的東西
And it'll give your mom a chance

280
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:17,014
省的我在礙手礙腳的
to get all her stuff moved in without me in the way.

281
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,021
好吧
Right.

282
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:21,052
你們要搬進來了嗎
You guys movin' in?

283
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:24,025
是啊 我 我是想過要告訴你
Yeah. I-I was meaning to tell you,

284
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,012
但我們都沒有機會
but we haven't had a chance to...

285
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:28,072
祝喜你們了
Congratulations.

286
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:30,036
謝謝你
Thank you.

287
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,016
謝謝
Thanks.

288
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:34,040
太好了
That's great.

289
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,056
整片社區都被沖毀了
Entire communities washed away.

290
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:38,087
到那兒以後打給我
Call me when you get there.

291
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,027
- 我會的 - 好的
- I will. - All right.

292
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,060
爸爸 我愛你 你一定要小心
I love you, dad. You be careful, please.

293
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,071
我會的 我會的 我也愛你
I will, I will. I love you, too.

294
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:48,011
當地政府提醒 可能還會
Local authorities caution that there could still be...

295
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:49,094
我去給她拿自行車
I'll get her bike.

296
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:52,011
很抱歉你們不能一起走
I'm sorry you guys can't go up there together.

297
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:54,021
我也感覺很糟糕
Yep. Me, too.

298
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:57,032
雷 雷
Ray. Ray.

299
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,025
我是想告訴你的
I was gonna tell you.

300
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,002
我們也是剛剛做的決定
We just decided to do it.

301
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:10,093
別多想了
Don't worry about it.

302
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:11,097
嘿 如果你想
Hey, If you want them...

303
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:13,080
我也會簽好離婚協議給你的
I'll get those papers signed for you, too.

304
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,053
當時是週日下午
Um, it was a Sunday afternoon.

305
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:40,036
大家很顯然都沒有上班
Um, obviously, people weren't at work.

306
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:41,086
也沒有睡覺
They weren't as... asleep.

307
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:45,000
即便如此 我們知道這次的破壞程度相當
Even so, we know the devastation was fairly...

308
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,013
太糟了
This is bad.

309
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,020
是啊
Yeah.

310
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,067
我們什麼時候出發
What time we headin' out?

311
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:52,044
下午兩點半 弟兄們都在準備救援裝備
Fourteen-thirty. Guys are preppin' the gear now.

312
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,014
好了 開始工作吧
All right. Let's get to work.

313
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:57,001
這次的救援行動困難重重
It's a fairly sophisticated rescue operation underway.

314
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:59,088
這個叫丹尼爾的送佈雷克過去
So this Daniel guy's taking Blake now?

315
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,078
我要是你的話就請病假了
I woulda just called in sick.

316
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,018
所以說我是頭兒 你不是
Uh, It's why I'm the boss and you're not.

317
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:07,042
就算沒有你的話 我們自己也能撐幾天的
Oh, pretty sure we can manage a few days without ya.

318
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,006
鞋帶鬆了
Shoe's untied.

319
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:10,036
哈哈哈
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

320
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:14,070
你在逗我嗎
Are you kidding me?!

321
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:26,044
佈雷克
Blake.

322
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:31,041
我想讓你知道
I want you to know that I respect

323
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,075
我尊重你和你爸爸的感情
what you and your dad have.

324
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:35,042
我也知道你一下子很難
And I know that your mom moving in

325
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,092
接受我和你媽媽住在一起
has to feel like a pretty big step.

326
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,005
但我從未想過破壞你和你父親的關係
But I'm never gonna try to change

327
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:42,089
或者取代他的位置
what you have with him or take his place.

328
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,036
好嗎
Okay?

329
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:46,006
好的
Yeah.

330
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:47,096
很好 當然
Okay, cool.

331
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,007
嘿  你為什麼一直沒有孩子呢
Hey, how come you never had kids?

332
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:55,004
我有啊
Oh, I did.

333
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:57,024
這是其中一個
This is one of them right here.

334
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,094
她是舊金山空中一道
She's a pretty nice addition

335
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:01,041
- 亮麗的風景線 你不覺得嗎 - 天門
- to the San Francisco skyline, don't you think? - "The gate."

336
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,004
- 很順口 對吧 - 是啊 我很喜歡
- Catchy, right? Yeah, I like it.

337
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,098
媽媽跟我說過
Mom was telling me about this.

338
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:09,005
她說這是城中最高的建築物 對嗎
She said It's the tallest building in the city, right?

339
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:11,079
完工後不僅是最高的
When It's finished, it'll be the tallest,

340
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,076
也是最結實的 而且已經賣出了百分之八十
strongest and It's already eighty percent sold.

341
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:18,069
但說實話 我一直忙著蓋樓
But, honestly, I guess I never had any kids

342
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:21,003
這也許就是我一直沒有孩子的原因
'cause I was always so busy raising these.

343
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
奧克蘭市立機場

344
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,080
媽媽發短信來了 她說她今天要和你妹妹一起吃午飯
Mom texted. She's having lunch with your sister today.

345
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:32,051
是啊 她只在城塈b幾天
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days

346
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:33,077
真的很想見你媽媽
and really wanted to meet her.

347
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,034
不過我有點緊張
I'm a little nervous though.

348
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:39,035
蘇珊對我保護欲有點過強了
Susan can be kind of overprotective.

349
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,065
謝謝
Thank you.

350
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:20,032
喬納森
Jonathan.

351
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:21,062
早上好 堶}克先生
Good morning, Mr. Riddick.

352
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,082
早上好 你一個人能行嗎 佈雷克
Morning. Gonna be okay, Blake?

353
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,049
行的 我沒事
Yeah, I'll be fine.

354
00:24:33,027 --> 00:24:35,007
你好
Hi.

355
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,017
你好
Hello.

356
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:54,049
我很抱歉 勞倫斯 我能幫什麼忙嗎
I'm sorry, Lawrence. Can I get you anything?

357
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:56,029
不用 我沒事 阿列克謝 謝謝你
No. I'm fine, Alexi. Thank you.

358
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:58,049
你確定你想留在這媔
Are you sure you want to be here?

359
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,049
這樣可以轉移我的注意力
I can use the distraction, actually.

360
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,083
什麼事
Yeah?

361
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,086
外面來了個記者
There's a reporter outside.

362
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:07,037
她說自己在做一個關於內華達地震的報道
Says she's doing a segment on what happened in Nevada.

363
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:09,010
哦
Oh.

364
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,071
那我現在就去告訴她 改天再說
I'm gonna tell her that It's not a good time.

365
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:15,031
不 等等
No, wait a minute.

366
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,044
基姆為此付出了生命
Kim gave his life for this.

367
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:18,075
人們需要知道
People need to know

368
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:20,055
我們現在可以預測這些事
that we can predict these things now.

369
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
震動
地震學的新進展
勞倫斯·海耶斯教授
基姆帕克博士

370
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:26,015
想要一本嗎
You want a copy?

371
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:29,006
我有差不多一千本庫存
I got about a thousand in storage.

372
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:31,039
地震之前 大概沒有人會相信我們的話
No one listens to us until the ground shakes, I guess.

373
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,093
他們把你同事的遭遇告訴我了
You know, they told me what happened to your colleague.

374
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:36,026
我們不必現在就進行採訪
We don't have to do this now.

375
00:25:36,026 --> 00:25:38,067
不 就現在
Yeah, we do.

376
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:41,017
我們準備好了
We're good to go.

377
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:43,007
- 好的 - 好的
- Okay. - 'Kay.

378
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,024
開始
Rolling.

379
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:45,084
第一個問題 為什麼
First question. How come

380
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:48,037
沒有人預測出內華達州的災難
no one saw what happened in Nevada coming?

381
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:51,038
因為我們不知道那埵麻_層線
Because we didn't know there were any fault lines out there.

382
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:52,058
為什麼不知道
Why not?

383
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:54,092
與主流觀點相悖
Contrary to popular belief,

384
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:56,095
科學家並非無所不知
scientists don't know everything.

385
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:59,085
我瞭解到 你曾經公開表示過 有一天
I understand that you publicly stated that, someday,

386
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:02,059
科學家們 將有能力準確的預測到地震
scientists will be able to predict earthquakes.

387
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,029
事實上 到昨天為止
Well, actually as of yesterday,

388
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,023
我們一直都相信我們可以做出預測
we now believe that we can predict them.

389
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,063
教授
Professor!

390
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:11,073
能跟你談談嗎
Talk to you a sec?

391
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:13,063
好的 很抱歉 失陪一下
Yeah. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

392
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:16,017
怎麼了
What is it?

393
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:18,087
這是我們監測站的磁脈衝率
Current pulse rates at our monitoring stations.

394
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,051
都沿著聖安德烈亞斯的斷層線
All along the San Andreas fault.

395
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:23,001
平均數值從82增長至85
Their averages are spiking from eighty-two to eighty-five,

396
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,041
峰谷差位於舊金山
with the biggest jumps coming from San Francisco.

397
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,061
比我們在內華達州地震觀測到的
More than twenty points higher

398
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,085
要高出20個點
than what we saw in Nevada.

399
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,002
不不不 這不可能
No. No, no, no. There's no way.

400
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:30,038
我們查了兩遍
We checked. We double-checked.

401
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,009
我們重置了所有儀器
Then we reset all the instruments

402
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,092
查了第三遍 結果一樣
and triple-checked. Those are the counts.

403
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,042
等一下
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

404
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:38,029
等等
Wait a minute.

405
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,083
呃
Um...

406
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:43,056
好的 呃
Okay, uh...

407
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,063
如果 呃
If, uh...

408
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:49,090
如果我們畫一條線 從聖安德烈亞斯底部
If we draw a line from the bottom of the San Andreas

409
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,017
直通到胡佛大壩
up to the hoover dam,

410
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:55,071
可以發現這條線幾乎是沿著科羅拉多河的
it almost literally follows the Colorado river,

411
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:59,021
而那條河流是自然變形造成的
which is a natural deformation event.

412
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:05,032
從地理角度看 變形通常發生在大陸板塊邊緣
And geologically, deformation events mark boundaries.

413
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:07,099
它們能標記出界限
They mark boundaries.

414
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:12,066
所以 要是
So, what If...?

415
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:16,016
要是這一大片土地
What if this whole chunk of land

416
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:17,096
都與地殼板塊相連呢
is connected to our tectonic plate?

417
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:19,083
那就表示 昨天在內華達州發生的地震
That would tell us that what happened yesterday in Nevada

418
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,070
並非異象
was not an anomaly.

419
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:28,001
不 如果這是板塊運動的開始
No, what if it was a precursor movement

420
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:31,085
而板塊的邊界
along the leading edge of the plate boundary fault

421
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:35,025
從洛杉磯一直延續到舊金山
from Los Angeles all the way up to San Francisco?

422
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:36,038
你是說
Are you saying you think

423
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:38,028
整個聖安德烈亞斯斷層可能崩塌
the whole San Andreas fault might go off?

424
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,099
沒錯 我說的就是這個意思
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

425
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,029
我們該通知誰
Who should we call?

426
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,099
通知所有人
Everybody.

427

00:49:04,084 --> 00:49:05,087
幹得漂亮
Good job.

698
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:09,071
快走 餘震又來了
Come on. It's another aftershock.

699
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,061
- 我們快離開這 - 好的
- We've got to get out of here. Okay!

700
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:17,075
小心! 快點 快!
Look out! Hurry! Come on!

701
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:19,085
快離開這
We have to get away from these buildings.

702
00:49:19,085 --> 00:49:22,029
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

703
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:25,019
佈雷克! 這邊 走這邊!
Blake! This way! This way!

704
00:49:27,093 --> 00:49:29,083
上帝啊 我的天!
Jesus! Oh, my God!

705
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:32,057
奧利! 佈雷克!
Ollie! Blake!

706
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:41,001
快! 走 走!
Come on! Go! Go!

707
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:52,028
真想不到丹尼爾會扔下我不管
I cannot believe that Daniel just took off.

708
00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:53,059
真是個混蛋
What an asshole.

709
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:58,012
請路上的人讓開 讓開
Step aside, people.

710
00:49:58,012 --> 00:49:59,099
我得盡快聯繫我父母
I gotta get ahold of my parents.

711
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,063
讓他們知道我沒事
I gotta let them know I'm okay.

712
00:50:01,063 --> 00:50:04,066
電話打不通 我試過了
Cellphones aren't working. I've tried.

713
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:08,003
我們得找一家電器商店
We need to find an electronics store.

714
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:12,007
你們的書上有購物指南嗎?
Does that book of yours list businesses?

715
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:15,057
我的書堣偵繷ㄕ
My book has everything.

716
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:18,054
好消息是 我們大部分的應急系統
The good news is most of our emergency systems

717
00:50:18,054 --> 00:50:20,038
還在運作 在這
are still working. Here.

718
00:50:20,038 --> 00:50:23,015
我們從17個監控器中檢測到了信號
We've got signals coming in from seventeen monitors.

719
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:28,025
我們剛剛經歷了一場9.1級強震
We just experienced a 9.1.

720
00:50:31,066 --> 00:50:34,016
勞倫斯... 來看看這個
Lawrence... You need to see this.

721
00:50:35,056 --> 00:50:37,010
獲取到什麼了?
What do we got?

722
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:41,033
這是震前採集的波頻率數據
Here are the pulse rates before the quake.

723
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:43,057
好的
Yeah, okay.

724
00:50:43,057 --> 00:50:45,054
這是目前的波頻率
And here are the pulse rates now.

725
00:50:45,054 --> 00:50:47,084
相同
The same.

726
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:49,017
甚至更高
Or higher.

727
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:51,018
所以地震並沒有減弱
So the earthquake didn't diminish them.

728
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:53,078
噢 天哪
Oh, man.

729
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:56,072
噢 情況不妙
Oh, this is not good.

730
00:50:56,072 --> 00:50:59,065
阿列克謝 把所有還在斷層上運作的監測站數據
Alexi, I want all the data from every monitoring station

731
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:02,045
現在全部匯報給我
still up along the fault line and get it for me now.

732
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:04,002
- 好的 - 出什麼事了?
- Right. - What's going on?

733
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:06,039
該死
Shit.

734
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,070
噢 天 都摔壞掉了
Oh, man. This thing's fried.

735
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,066
快點 我需要所有人的幫忙
Come on. I need everybody.

736
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:14,097
- 我們要做什麼? - 讓你來廣播
- W-what are we doing? - Gettin' you on the air.

737
00:51:14,097 --> 00:51:16,030
我們要通知所有人
We need to warn people.

738
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,010
要怎麼做? 信號都中斷了
How? There's no way to upload a signal.

739
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,074
這堨i是加州理工學院
You're at Caltech.

740
00:51:29,092 --> 00:51:32,038
好了 你們誰想在獨立研究課上得A?
Okay, who wants an A in independent study?

741
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:33,085
我開一門新課:
I'm startin' a new class:

742
00:51:33,085 --> 00:51:36,029
"如何通過入侵電視台來拯救人類"
"How to save lives by hacking media outlets."

743
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:39,082
哦不錯 我參加
Hell yeah, man. I'm in.

744
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:42,069
很好 帶上筆記本電腦 出發
Sweet, bro. Get your laptop. Let's go.

745
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,057
在這邊 快快快
Right here. Move, move, move.

746
00:51:46,057 --> 00:51:48,077
好了 起
Here we go. Up. Lift.

747
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,024
應該不遠了
It should be just up ahead.

748
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:56,031
就在那兒
There it is.

749
00:52:05,082 --> 00:52:08,089
好 任何需要靠電運作的東西都不能用
Okay, anything running on electricity isn't gonna work,

750
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:11,099
所以我們要找一個撥盤的或者按鍵的電話
so we have to find a rotary or a push button phone.

751
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,009
你怎麼知道這些的?
How do you know all this?

752
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:17,046
我爸爸教我的 他在洛杉磯消防局工作
My dad. He works for L.A. fire and rescue.

753
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:23,067
在這呢
Over here.

754
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:26,024
太好了 我找找通訊線
Great. I'll look for a landline.

755
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,089
找到了!
I got one!

756
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,070

她沒事
She's okay.

759
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:58,024
讓我和她說說話
Oh. Let me talk to her.

760
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:00,077
佈雷克?

761
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,037

764
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,012
他丟下我跑了 媽媽
He left me, mom.

765
00:53:11,012 --> 00:53:12,032
他怎麼了?
He what?

766
00:53:12,032 --> 00:53:15,005
他告訴保安我的位置
He told a security guard where I was

767
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:16,069
然後就丟下我不管了
and then he just took off

768
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,042
有一對兄弟聽到了談話
and these two brothers that I met overheard him

769
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:20,019
就趕過來救了我
and they came to help me.

770
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:21,089
我現在和他們在一起
I'm with them right now.

771
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:24,023
他把她丟下了
He left her?!

我在唐人街的一家電器店
I'm in an-an electronics store in Chinatown.

774
00:53:30,014 --> 00:53:31,044
親愛的 會沒事的
Honey, It's gonna be okay

775
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:33,000
但是你聽我說

Getting outta there

777
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:36,014
那邊馬上就會堵得死死的

778
00:53:36,014 --> 00:53:37,084

784
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:48,089

Please leave me a message and I'll get back to you.

794
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,009
你竟敢把我女兒扔下不管了?
You left my daughter?

795
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:28,039
如果你沒死 我會過去親手宰了你
If you're not already dead, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

796
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:32,083

好了 我們得離開這
All right, we need to get going.

798
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,051
那你爸爸怎麼來接我們?
So how is your dad going to pick us up?

799
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:42,047
他駕駛直升機 正趕過來
He's on his way in a helicopter.

800
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:43,078
真是太酷了
That's so cool.

801
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:48,075
我需要你們幫我在地圖上找到科伊特塔
I need you to look up Coit tower on your map.

802
00:54:51,008 --> 00:54:52,078
輪到你打電話了
It's your turn.

803

待在路面上
Stay on the street.

806
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:11,084
我們去哪兒?
Where are we going?

807
00:55:34,013 --> 00:55:35,070
別擋路!
Get out of my way!

808
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,087
嘿! 那是我的地盤!
Hey! That was my spot!

809
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:03,092
你知道嗎 你和佈雷克通話的時候
You know, when you were talking to Blake

810
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:08,009
那是馬洛堥咫F之後
that was the first time I heard you say Mallory's name

811
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:09,070
我第一次聽你提到馬洛堛漲W字
since we lost her.

812
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:15,037
你記得我們在舊金山旅遊的時候的照片嗎?
Hey, do you know that Blake keeps pictures

813
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:17,014
佈雷克一直留著
from our San Francisco trip?

814
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:18,094
記得 在她的回憶盒
Yeah, in her memory box.

815
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:26,041
真想不到 我們有一天還會回到那堨h
It's ironic. Us heading back up there.

816
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,075
那一次很開心的旅行
It was a fun trip.

817
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:40,089
我們在哪?
Where are we?

818
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:43,086
貝克斯菲爾德 已經是一片廢墟了
Bakersfield. Or what's left of it.

819
00:56:43,086 --> 00:56:47,097
離舊金山大概還有90分鐘的航程
We're just about ninety minutes from San Francisco.

820
00:56:57,028 --> 00:56:58,064
雷?!
Ray?!

821
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:07,029
你關掉引擎了嗎?
Did you just turn off the engine?

822
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:08,055
是的 我們的變速裝置出故障了
Yeah, we got a gearbox failure.

823
00:57:08,055 --> 00:57:10,002
肯定是剛才在洛杉磯撞到的
Must've been that hit we took in L.A.

824
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:11,092
現在只能自行降落了
I'm gonna have to auto rotate down.

825
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:15,003
自什麼?
A-auto-what?

826
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:16,019
撞到地上
We're gonna crash.

827
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,047
- 好 好吧 - 抓緊了
- Right. Okay. - Hold on.

828
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,063
開始了
Here we go.

829
00:57:36,028 --> 00:57:38,045
抓緊!
Hold on!

830
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:43,029
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

831
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:45,039
要到了 要到了
Almost there. Almost there.

832
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,023
就在那堶偶
Just gonna set it down right here.

833
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:10,088
我們身上都是燃料 快點從這堨X去
We got fuel all over us. We need to get outta here.

834
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,003
快點 離開
Come on. We gotta go.

835
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:27,083
- 低下身子 - 好的
- Stay low. Stay low. - Okay.

836
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:34,061
沒事的 我們繼續走
It's okay. We just gotta keep movin'.

837
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:36,094
繼續往前 好
Just gotta keep movin'. All right.

838
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:41,018
給我!
Give it to me!

839
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,051
不! 這是我的!
No! It's mine!

840
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:56,076
快 快 快
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

841
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:01,087
進去 進去
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

842
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:03,087
這車好像是偷來的
Looks like It's been stolen.

843
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:06,031
好 我們再偷一次
All right. Well, We'll steal it again.

844
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:15,015
雷
Ray.

845
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:16,098
冷靜點
Easy.

846
00:59:20,072 --> 00:59:22,012
我需要那輛卡車
I'll be needin' that truck.

847
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:26,036
今天可不行
Not today.

848
00:59:26,036 --> 00:59:28,023
哦 天吶
Oh, my God.

849
00:59:42,001 --> 00:59:43,084
這次地震
The quake centered

850
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,064
以洛杉磯市中心東部二十英里處為中心
about twenty Miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

851
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:47,005
信號塔都毀了
Cell towers are down.

852
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:49,028
城堛漱j部分電力也中斷了
Most of the city's electricity, down.

853
00:59:49,028 --> 00:59:51,078
通訊處於停滯狀態
Communication at a virtual standstill.

854
00:59:51,078 --> 00:59:53,099
對加利福尼亞南部地區
The devastation to Southern California

855
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,042
造成了災難性的破壞
is expected to be massive.

856
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:58,042
事實上 整個州都受到影響
In fact, the entire state will take a hit.

857
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:01,059
- 我們已經收到有關建築物塌陷的報道 - 我們進去了
- We're already getting reports of collapsed buildings - We're in.

858
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:05,000
- 北至舊金山和海灣地區 - 太棒了
- As far north as San Francisco and the surrounding bay area. - Yes.

859
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,030
至少已經發生過五次餘震了
There have been at least five aftershocks.

860
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,013
好的 我們開始了
Okay. Here we go.

861
01:00:09,013 --> 01:00:10,090
製片人告訴我們
Uh, producers are telling us

862
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,004
我們有來自洛杉磯的首次現場直播
we have our first live feed from Los Angeles.

863
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:13,027
拍攝開始 五 四...
We're rolling. Five, four...

864
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,001
塞雷娜·約翰遜現在正在
Serena Johnson is on the ground

865
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:17,021
加利福尼亞工學院地震學中心現場
at the seismology center at caltech.

866
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:18,018
你好 克奡
Hello, Chris.

867
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:19,098
現在坐在我身邊的是
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes,

868
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:22,035
加利福尼亞工學院地震研究室執行理事勞倫斯·海耶斯教授
executive director for earthquake studies at caltech.

869
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,015
他和他的研究夥伴基姆帕克博士
He and his research partner, Dr. Kim park,

870
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:27,069
設計出了一個可以預測地震的理論模型
have come up with a model that predicts earthquakes.

871
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:30,009
他們預測到洛杉磯會發生地震
They knew L.A. was going to get hit.

872
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:31,086
可是沒有人理會他們
But nobody listened to them.

873
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:34,063
現在讓我們一起來聽聽吧 請說吧 教授
It's time now to listen. Go ahead, doctor.

874
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,049
好的 用地震學術語來說
Okay. Um, in seismology terms,

875
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,096
我們現在所經歷的叫做地震群體事件
what we're experiencing is what we call a swarm event.

876
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:41,093
基本上來說 加利福尼亞
Um, basically, California's

877
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:43,097
整個地殼構造板塊都移動了
entire tectonic plate has shifted.

878
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,077
目前看來 我們在洛杉磯
Yes, it seems the quake we experienced here

879
01:00:45,077 --> 01:00:47,004
發生的地震 一路蔓延
in Los Angeles did major damage

880
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:48,047
對舊金山造成了極大的破壞
all the way up in San Francisco.

881
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:50,017
是的 不過他們感受到的地震
Yeah. Yeah, but the earthquake that they felt

882
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:51,088
來自中央谷
was from movement along the fault line

883
01:00:51,088 --> 01:00:53,031
斷層線的活動
in the central valley.

884
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:55,031
而尾部的斷層線還沒有開始移動
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

885
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:57,068
更重要的是 大家必須知道
Uh, more importantly, people need to know

886
01:00:57,068 --> 01:00:59,022
地震尚未結束
that the shaking is not over.

887
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,019
我說的地震 而不是餘震
And It's not aftershocks I'm talking about.

888
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:03,025
舊金山還會再次發生地震
San Francisco will get hit again.

889
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,009
而且會比這次的更加嚴重
And It's going to be a bigger monster this time.

890
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:08,049
我們的樣機預測震級至少是9.5
Our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater.

891
01:01:08,049 --> 01:01:11,056
震動會極為強烈 即便是在加利福尼亞
It will be so big that even though It's happening

892
01:01:11,056 --> 01:01:12,083
發生的地震
here in California

893
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:17,040
你在東海岸也會有震感
you will feel it on the east coast.

894
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:22,027
所以 我在這堶n鄭重的提醒
Now, I cannot emphasize this enough

895
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:24,031
舊金山的人們
to the people of San Francisco:

896
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:26,068
你們得馬上離開 就現在
You need to get out. And I mean now.

897
01:01:26,068 --> 01:01:29,055
如若來不及的話 你們需要
And, If you can't, you need to find

898
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:33,035
找到任何何以掩護或者抓牢的東西
any means possible to drop cover and hold on.

899
01:01:33,035 --> 01:01:36,046
因為你們能不能活下來全靠它了
Because your life is gonna depend on it.

900
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,079
願上帝與你們同在
God be with you.

901
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,023
餘震依舊
Aftershocks continue

902
01:01:48,023 --> 01:01:49,080
搖晃著洛杉磯地區
to rock the Los Angeles area...

903
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,090
你有沒有想過 要是沒有失去馬洛堛爾
You ever think about what our life would be like.

904
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,014
我們的生活會是什麼樣
If we hadn't lost mallory?

905
01:01:53,014 --> 01:01:54,067
專家們建議大家...
People are advised to...

906
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:56,078
艾瑪 別這樣
Em, don't.

907
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:59,051
我想過 每時每刻都在想
I do. All the time.

908
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:01,001
我們已經向前看了
We've moved on.

909
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:02,071
不 我們沒有
No, we didn't move on.

910
01:02:02,071 --> 01:02:04,092
我們停在了那個時刻
We stopped moving.

911
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:06,092
她又不是因為你沒有看好而死去的
You didn't lose her on your watch.

912
01:02:06,092 --> 01:02:08,005
確實 但是我失去她了
No. But I lost her.

913
01:02:08,005 --> 01:02:09,032
我們能不討論這個嗎
Can we not talk about this?

914
01:02:09,032 --> 01:02:11,016
你欠我的
You owe it to me.

915
01:02:11,016 --> 01:02:12,046
又是這樣
This!

916
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:14,096
自從她死了你幾乎每天都是這樣
This is the most I've gotten out of you since she died.

917
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:17,036
我真的想知道 雷
I need to know, Ray.

918
01:02:17,036 --> 01:02:21,067
是因為我嗎 是我做了什麼嗎
Was... was it me? What did I do?

919
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:23,060
因為我從沒怪過你
Because I never blamed you.

920
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,094
我不想談這個
I don't wanna talk about it.

921
01:02:25,094 --> 01:02:28,071
我 這還有什麼關係呢 她都不在了
I... it doesn't matter. She's gone.

922
01:02:28,071 --> 01:02:30,001
現在你也離開了
Now you're gone.

923
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:31,081
還有什麼意義呢
What's the point?

924
01:02:34,058 --> 01:02:36,038
我覺得問題在於
I guess the point is

925
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:39,065
這就是我沒留下的原因
this is why I didn't stick around.

926
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:43,022
聽起來是極其嚴重的情況 勞麗
Sounds like a terrible situation there, Laurie.

927
01:02:43,022 --> 01:02:45,042
我知道當時一定很艱難...
I know that it must have been very difficult...

928
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:47,069
嗨 注意 小心
Hey! Look out! Watch out!

929
01:02:47,069 --> 01:02:49,046
嗨 嗨 快停下
Hey! Hey! You have to stop!

930
01:02:51,053 --> 01:02:53,050
雷
Ray!

931
01:03:22,093 --> 01:03:25,010
這是什麼情況
What is this?

932
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,097
聖安德烈亞斯斷層
The San Andreas fault.

933
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:45,052
我說過我們該走另一條路的
I told you we should've gone the other way.

934
01:03:45,052 --> 01:03:47,049
因為你預測到了會發生這個嗎
Because you knew this was gonna happen?

935
01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:48,069
哦
Oh.

936
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:50,029
你
You!

937
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,016
我們真的非常感激你們
We owe you guys a huge thanks.

938
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:58,016
不必了
No need.

939
01:03:58,016 --> 01:04:00,066
我們差點也犯了同樣的錯
We nearly made the same mistake ourselves

940
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:03,050
不過我們駛離道路的時候爆了個車軸
but busted an axle when we ran off the road.

941
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,006
多虧我視力比他的好
Thank goodness my eyes are better'n his.

942
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:08,071
請問這埵雩纀鉰飪L去嗎
Do you know If there's any way around this?

943
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:13,011
這個嘛 198號公路可能還行
Well, uh... the one-ninety-eight might not be out.

944
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:15,045
- 剛好能繞過去 - 有多遠呢
- Through the pass. - How far is that?

945
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:19,058
你們得掉個頭走 大概七十英里
Oh, ya gotta backtrack, maybe, seventy Miles or so.

946
01:04:28,016 --> 01:04:31,063
先生 冒昧問一句
Sir, If you don't mind me Askin'...

947
01:04:31,063 --> 01:04:33,030
你的帽子是哪來的
Where'd you get your hat?

948
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,040
你們可真幫了我們大忙了
You guys really bailed us out.

949
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,090
真的不用我們送你們去哪嗎
You sure we can't fly you anywhere?

950
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,090
不用了 我們兒子住在山上
Yeah. Our son lives in the mountains.

951
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:41,017
那堨i沒地方能降落
There's no place to land.

952
01:04:41,017 --> 01:04:43,094
多謝你的車了
Thanks for the wheels. You bet.

953
01:04:43,094 --> 01:04:46,058
路上小心 拜
Be safe. Bye.

954
01:05:01,003 --> 01:05:03,036
再過幾分鐘油就加滿了
We should be fueled up in a couple of minutes.

955
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:04,053
好啊 太好了
Okay, great.

956
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:15,087
你還好吧
Everything okay?

957
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:20,041
你剛才問我是不是因為你
You asked me before If it was you.

958
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,011
其實不是
It wasn't.

959
01:05:24,098 --> 01:05:27,092
我知道你不怪我
I knew you didn't blame me.

960
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:33,026
我...我只是不知道該怎麼面對馬洛堛漲
I... I just didn't know how to deal with Mallory's death.

961
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:47,064
那天帶馬洛堨h漂流是我的主意
It was my idea to take mallory rafting that day.

962
01:05:47,064 --> 01:05:50,004
雷
Ray.

963
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:53,081
你不該這樣責怪自己
You can't blame yourself for what happened.

964
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:59,005
可當出事的是自己的孩子時感覺真的太難過了
It's just different when It's your own kid.

965
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:00,018
我知道
I know.

966
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:01,075
- 爸爸 - 馬洛
- Dad! - Mallory!

967
01:06:01,075 --> 01:06:04,026
有時候 我無法把她當時看我的表情從腦海奡坏h
Sometimes I can't get that look she had outta my head.

968
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:07,036
就是那一刻
The moment she realized

969
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:11,063
她意識到我救不了她
that... I wasn't gonna be able to save her.

970
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:17,067
然後每天回家面對你和佈雷克
And then coming home every day to you and Blake

971
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:19,034
只會使之變得更難
only made it harder.

972
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:26,008
因為我們再也回不到從前了
Because nothin' was the way it used to be.

973
01:06:26,008 --> 01:06:30,021
而我們的從前...
And the way it used to be was...

974
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:31,098
是那麼完美
It was perfect.

975
01:06:36,012 --> 01:06:38,009
我本該對你敞開心扉的
I should've let you in.

976
01:06:41,076 --> 01:06:44,033
我只是不知道該怎麼做
I just didn't know how.

977
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:49,077
而我們之間卻這樣結束了 我很抱歉 艾瑪
I'm so sorry for how things ended with us, em.

978
01:06:49,077 --> 01:06:54,017
我真的很抱歉
I really am.

979
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:01,075
若是連你都救不了我們的女兒...
If you couldn't save our daughter...

980
01:07:01,075 --> 01:07:04,038
其他人更不行
Then nobody could have.

981
01:07:11,076 --> 01:07:15,016
我真的很想她
I miss her so much.

982
01:07:15,016 --> 01:07:18,026
我也是
Me, too.

983
01:07:22,027 --> 01:07:26,031
去救我們的女兒吧
Let's go get our daughter.

984
01:07:51,003 --> 01:07:53,040
快走啊 繼續走
Let's go! Keep it movin'!

985
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,090
快走 加油 快走
Let's go! Come on. Let's go.

986
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,080
順著疏散路線走
Follow the evacuation route.

987
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,030
再走幾條街就到倫巴第街道
Just a few more blocks to Lombard Avenue,

988
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:02,011
然後就能直接到科伊特塔
which leads to Coit tower.

989
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,031
我能問問
Do you mind If I ask

990
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:09,075
你為什麼戴著兩條一樣的項鏈嗎
why you wear two of the same necklaces?

991
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:10,025
呃...
Um...

992
01:08:14,012 --> 01:08:16,042
其中一條是我妹妹的
One of them used to be my sister's.

993
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:20,096
我... 自從她去世後我就開始把它戴上了
I, uh... I started wearing it after she died.

994
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,036
在那場事故發生的前一年
We had given them to each other

995
01:08:22,036 --> 01:08:24,020
這是我們送給彼此的聖誕禮物
for Christmas the year before.

996
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:28,070
我... 我很抱歉 我... 我不是有意...
I'm... I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean...

997
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,084
沒關係的 我並沒打算掩飾什麼
No. It's okay. I'm... I'm not hiding them.

998
01:08:34,074 --> 01:08:36,097
嗨 快看吶
Hey. Check it out.

999
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:38,031
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

1000
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,068
他們應該有個電源箱的
They should have a supply box.

1001
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:41,075
堶惘釦畯怚帢o上的東西
It'll have stuff that we can use.

1002
01:08:44,065 --> 01:08:46,078
是這個嗎
Is this it?

1003
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,009
沒錯
Yes!

1004
01:08:50,009 --> 01:08:54,083
好 看著
Oh, okay. There we go.

1005
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,066
每個城市都有一個現場急救員
Every city has a tactical channel

1006
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:58,053
用來通話用的火災指揮用頻道
that first responders use to communicate on.

1007
01:08:58,053 --> 01:09:00,053
我們可以留著聽最新動態
We can listen in and we can see what's going on.

1008
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,093
好 拿著這些
Okay. Here. Take these.

1009
01:09:02,093 --> 01:09:03,093
好的
Yeah.

1010
01:09:03,094 --> 01:09:05,010
拿著這個
Take this.

1011
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:08,054
- Mre是什麼 - 就是應急食品
- What's an mre? - Meals ready-to-eat.

1012
01:09:08,054 --> 01:09:11,064
這些東西有三年以上的保質期
These things have a shelf life of over three years.

1013
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,018
嘗起來不怎麼樣
Wow. They don't taste so good.

1014
01:09:13,018 --> 01:09:14,028
酷
Cool.

1015
01:09:14,028 --> 01:09:16,025
佈雷克
Blake!

1016
01:09:16,025 --> 01:09:17,082
我覺得我們可能去不了
I think we're going to have a problem

1017
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:20,015
你說的那個噴嘴樣的地方了
with that big nozzle thing you were talking about.

1018
01:09:20,015 --> 01:09:23,072
什麼 你在說什麼
What? What do you mean?

1019
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:26,053
我的天吶
Oh, my God.

1020
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,097
我們得啟用B計劃
We have to go to plan B.

1021
01:09:35,097 --> 01:09:38,077
我們好像沒有B計劃吧
I didn't think we had one.

1022
01:09:38,077 --> 01:09:40,027
現在有了
We do now.

1023
01:09:42,064 --> 01:09:44,028
我們得去另外一個最高的地方
We need to get to the next highest ground

1024
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:45,061
給我爸爸發信號
so that we can signal my dad

1025
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:47,041
所以我們要去諾布山
in the helicopter. That would be Nob Hill.

1026
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,001
那是市堻怜牧漲a方
It's the highest point in the city.

1027
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,088
在另一邊
It's the other way.

1028
01:09:50,088 --> 01:09:52,032
走吧
Okay. Come on!

1029
01:09:52,032 --> 01:09:57,029
佈雷克 等一下 等一下
Bl-no. Blake, wait! Wait! Just... just wait.

1030
01:09:57,029 --> 01:10:00,023
借過 讓一讓 讓一讓
Coming through. Move, move, move.

1031
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:26,018
佈雷克 只有我們在往那個方向去
Blake, we'd be the only ones going that way.

1032
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,089
我爸爸說去最高的地方
My dad said to get to higher ground,

1033
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,085
那我們就去最高的地方
so that's what we gotta do.

1034
01:10:28,085 --> 01:10:31,089
可... 要是他來不了怎麼辦
But... what If he doesn't make it?

1035
01:10:31,089 --> 01:10:35,023
我知道這聽起來可能有點瘋狂
Listen, I know that this sounds crazy.

1036
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:38,063
不過你得相信他一定會來的
But you have to trust me that he will.

1037
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:44,047
我... 我...
I... I c...

1038
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:48,074
本
Ben.

1039
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:51,061
你知道按鍵式電話能和
Did you know about the push-button phone

1040
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:53,044
陸線連接起來用嗎
working with the landline?

1041
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:56,028
電源箱
The supply box?

1042
01:10:56,028 --> 01:11:00,045
火災指揮用頻道
Tactical radio channels?

1043
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:04,012
我真覺得我們應該和她一起
I really think we should stick with her.

1044
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:16,037
好吧 看來我們是要去諾布山了
Okay. Looks like we're going to Nob Hill.

1045
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:20,041
好的 走吧
Okay. Let's go.

1046
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:29,088
這條信息是加利福尼亞
The following message is transmitted at the request

1047
01:11:29,088 --> 01:11:31,068
應急管理部門要求發送的
of the California emergency management.

1048
01:11:31,068 --> 01:11:35,049
請居民們立刻撤離
Residents are encouraged to evacuate immediately.

1049
01:11:35,049 --> 01:11:37,039
看來整個城市都在撤離
Looks like the whole city's evacuating.

1050
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:40,046
艾瑪 機場好像去不了了
Em, we got a problem at the airport.

1051
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:48,083
那我們能從哪堶偶
Where are we gonna land?

1052
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,073
沒辦法了
We can't.

1053
01:11:49,073 --> 01:11:52,067
至少不能在城市堶
At least, not in the city.

1054
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:16,043
跟我來
Come with me.

1055
01:12:16,043 --> 01:12:20,093
哦... 好的
Uh... okay.

1056
01:12:23,057 --> 01:12:25,064
你不是開玩笑的吧
You gotta be kidding me.

1057
01:12:25,064 --> 01:12:29,001
艾瑪 我們現在沒地方降落了
Em, we have no place to set this plane down

1058
01:12:29,001 --> 01:12:31,088
我們必須盡可能的靠近科伊特塔
and we have to get as close to Coit tower as we possibly can.

1059
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:34,018
三分鐘內 我們就會飛到內河碼頭上方
In three minutes, we're gonna be over the embarcadero.

1060
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:35,041
然後呢
And?

1061
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:39,002
然後我們跳到At&t運動場堨h
And, we're gonna drop into AT&T park.

1062
01:12:39,002 --> 01:12:41,032
可我不會跳傘
But I don't know how to parachute.

1063
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:42,082
沒關係 我們雙人串聯跳傘
That's okay. We're gonna tandem-jump.

1064
01:12:42,082 --> 01:12:44,082
我 我我覺得還是待在飛機堣騆好
I-I-I think we should just stay with the plane.

1065
01:12:44,082 --> 01:12:46,069
飛機一旦耗盡燃油
The plane's gonna nosedive in the pacific

1066
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:48,023
就會直接俯衝掉到太平洋
as soon as it runs out of gas.

1067
01:12:48,023 --> 01:12:51,056
那好吧
Okay. Mm.

1068
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,054
相信我
Trust me.

1069
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:02,094
我的天
Oh, my God!

1070
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,011
準備好了嗎
You ready?

1071
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:12,015
- 我像準備好的樣子嗎 - 那是
- Do I sound ready?! - Yep!

1072
01:14:11,094 --> 01:14:16,038
我有好久沒沒讓你上二壘了
It's been a while since I got you to second base.

1073
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:21,032
隨著勞倫斯·海耶斯博士的沉重警告
With a grave warning from Dr. Lawrence Hayes

1074
01:14:21,032 --> 01:14:22,082
在電視廣播上播出
blanketing the airwaves...

1075
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:25,059
舊金山已開始實施撤退方案
San Francisco has begun evacuation procedures.

1076
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:29,009
海岸巡邏隊希望任何一個有船隻的人士
The coast guard is asking anyone with access to a boat

1077
01:14:29,009 --> 01:14:30,069
都能參與其中...
to will please volunteer in the process...

1078
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,020
斷層線的活動
fault line in the central valley.

1079
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,086
而斷層線的尾部還沒有開始移動
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

1080
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,070
舊金山還會再次發生地震
San Francisco is going to get hit again,

1081
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:38,004
而且會比這次的更加嚴重
and this will be a much bigger monster.

1082
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:42,017
我真希望所有人都聽到了我們的預警
I hope we've given everyone enough warning.

1083
01:14:42,017 --> 01:14:43,067
這真是破天荒頭一次
Would be the first of its kind.

1084
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:49,001
這就是你說的嗎
This is it, isn't it?

1085
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:51,058
此時此刻 我希望我是錯的
Right now, I wanna be so wrong.

1086
01:14:51,058 --> 01:14:53,062
大家快找掩體
Everyone, take cover!

1087
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,083
這很快就會結束的
This will be over soon here.

1088
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:06,013
為舊金山的人們祈禱吧
But pray for the people of San Francisco.

1089
01:15:06,013 --> 01:15:09,053
你知道嗎 nob是個俚語
Did you know "nob" is a slang term

1090
01:15:09,053 --> 01:15:12,070
意思是富裕 富有
which means "rich" or "wealthy".

1091
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:15,011
是"Nobility"貴族的簡寫
"It's a shortened version of the word 'nobility',

1092
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,021
因為住在這堛熙ㄛO富有家庭
because of the families that live there.

1093
01:15:17,021 --> 01:15:20,011
這堣S被稱為斯諾希爾
It is also derisively known as 'snob hill'."

1094
01:15:27,005 --> 01:15:28,065
怎麼了
what is it?

1095
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,072
丹尼爾造的那座建築
Daniel built that building.

1096
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:35,019
我的天吶
Oh, my God.

1097
01:15:39,026 --> 01:15:40,063
我操
Oh, shit.

1098
01:15:45,024 --> 01:15:47,057
快走 快走
Move! Move!

1099
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:50,004
走啊 奧利
Come on, Ollie!

1100
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:03,039
奧利
Ollie!

1101
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:06,006
我想回家
I want to go home now!

1102
01:16:06,006 --> 01:16:07,066
堅持住
Just hold on!

1103
01:16:07,066 --> 01:16:11,066
一會就好 我保證
It's gonna be okay. I promise!

1104
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,004
他們在那媟|喪命的
They're gonna get killed out there.

1105
01:16:55,004 --> 01:16:56,097
艾瑪 到體育場的邊上去
Em, get to the side of the stadium.

1106
01:16:56,098 --> 01:16:59,014
我馬上就回來 我馬上就回來
I'll be right there. I'll be right there!

1107
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:01,011
這堣ㄕw全 到體育場的邊上去
It's not safe here. Get to the side of the stadium!

1108
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:02,078
馬上到體育場的邊上去
Go to the side of the stadium right now!

1109
01:17:02,078 --> 01:17:06,085
這座樓要塌了 快走啊
This building's gonna collapse. You need to move!

1110
01:17:06,085 --> 01:17:08,072
趕快 趕緊離開街道
Hurry! You gotta get off the street!

1111
01:17:08,072 --> 01:17:10,062
到體育場的邊上去 快啊
Get to the side of the stadium! Right now!

1112
01:17:10,062 --> 01:17:13,022
體育場的邊上去 到體育場的邊上去
Side of the stadium. Get to the side of the stadium!

1113
01:17:13,022 --> 01:17:15,043
快點 快點 快離開街道
Come on. Come on. Come on. Off the street!

1114
01:17:15,043 --> 01:17:17,073
去體育場 到體育場的邊上去
Get to the stadium. Side of the stadium!

1115
01:17:17,073 --> 01:17:19,053
快點 離開街道
Come on! Get out of the street!

1116
01:17:28,047 --> 01:17:30,001
沒事的 有我在
It's all right! I got you.

1117
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:31,041
有我在 起
I got you. And up!

1118
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:38,068
- 這邊 雷 - 帶上她
- Over here, Ray! - Take her.

1119
01:17:38,068 --> 01:17:40,038
- 帶上她 艾瑪 - 好的
- Here. Take her, em. - I got her!

1120
01:17:46,032 --> 01:17:49,073
你會沒事的 你會沒事的
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

1121
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:50,093
會沒事的
It's all right.

1122
01:17:50,093 --> 01:17:53,003
大家都蹲下
Everybody down!

1123
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:17,002
大家都好吧 有沒有人受傷
Everybody okay? Anybody hurt?

1124
01:18:17,002 --> 01:18:18,039
沒有
No.

1125
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:25,023
艾瑪 你沒事吧
Emma. You okay?

1126
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:28,080
沒事
Yeah.

1127
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:33,014
你是怎麼知道這埵w全的
How'd you know we'd be safe?

1128
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:36,054
因為我們躲在一個堅固的東西邊上
Just get up against something sturdy.

1129
01:18:36,054 --> 01:18:37,098
想要保護好自己
Protect yourself.

1130
01:18:37,098 --> 01:18:39,091
就要尋找地震活命三角區
Triangle of life.

1131
01:18:37,098 --> 01:18:39,091
地震活命三角區是由加拿大人道格-庫普提出的一種理論，
是指地震發生後，室內的人應該躲在大而堅實的物體旁，
這樣牆體和梁倒下後能與該物體形成一個三角空間，
躲在這個空間堛漱H便可活命

1132
01:18:43,082 --> 01:18:45,008
走吧
Let's go.

1133
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:21,025
她會平安無事的
She's gonna be okay.

1134
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,093
但我們要怎樣才能橫穿過去呢
But how do we get through that?

1135
01:19:34,007 --> 01:19:38,007
我們不橫穿過去 我們繞過去
We don't. We go around it.

1136
01:19:41,034 --> 01:19:42,037
嗷
Oh.

1137
01:19:49,038 --> 01:19:50,035
好了
Oh, okay.

1138
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,025
我們得把這個碎片取出來
We have to get that out of there.

1139
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:55,002
如果繼續帶著它前進的話 傷勢會加重的
If you try walking with it, it could cause more damage.

1140
01:20:05,003 --> 01:20:09,007
這會很疼的 你準備好了嗎
This is gonna hurt. Are you ready?

1141
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:23,021
啊 啊
Gah! Ahh.

1142
01:20:23,021 --> 01:20:24,045
本
Ben!

1143
01:20:25,072 --> 01:20:29,079
沒事兒 我沒事兒
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1144
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:32,072
你覺得你還能繼續前進嗎
Do you think you could put some weight on it?

1145
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:35,039
我們得接著走 我們還得爬過那座山
We have to keep moving. We gotta get up that hill.

1146
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,096
行
Yeah.

1147
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:39,053
好的 來吧
Okay. Here.

1148
01:20:54,038 --> 01:20:56,098
這次地震究竟有多強烈
How bad did they get hit?

1149
01:21:01,025 --> 01:21:03,089
九點六級
9.6.

1150
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:08,043
有史以來最強烈的一次地震
Largest quake in recorded history.

1151
01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:41,029
噢 不
Oh, no.

1152
01:21:46,013 --> 01:21:47,086
這兒已經燒了一陣子了
Coit's been burning a while.

1153
01:21:47,087 --> 01:21:49,040
她肯定逃到別的地方去了
She's gone someplace else.

1154
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:54,020
寶貝 你在哪兒呢 在哪兒呢
Now, where are you, baby? Where are you?

1155
01:21:54,021 --> 01:21:56,001
你的B計劃是什麼
What's your plan b?

1156
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,005
噢 該死的
Oh, shit.

1157
01:22:09,005 --> 01:22:10,045
怎麼了
What's happening?

1158
01:22:10,045 --> 01:22:11,052
我們得趕緊走
We gotta go.

1159
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:13,022
海水的波動表明海嘯即將來襲
Water being pulled out like that's a Tsunami.

1160
01:22:13,022 --> 01:22:15,023
我們得離開這個港灣 趕快
We gotta get outta the bay, now.

1161
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,027
等等 等等 等一下
Wait. Wait, wait a second,

1162
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:27,057
- 讓我歇一下 - 讓你休息一下吧
- just give me one second. - Give you a second.

1163
01:22:27,057 --> 01:22:30,004
天啦
God!

1164
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:35,041
氣象部門剛對加州中部和北部的沿海地區
The weather service has issued a Tsunami warning

1165
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:38,045
發佈了海嘯預警
for coastal areas of northern and central California,

1166
01:22:38,045 --> 01:22:41,002
包括馬林郡 納帕
including the following Marin, napa,

1167
01:22:41,002 --> 01:22:43,042
舊金山 蒙特媯市陞
San Francisco and Monterey.

1168
01:22:52,073 --> 01:22:54,020
快 我們得趕快走
Come on, guys. We gotta go!

1169
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:56,003
快走 我們得趕快走
We gotta go! We gotta move fast!

1170
01:22:56,003 --> 01:22:57,074
我們得去丹尼爾那座寫字樓
We gotta get to Daniel's building.

1171
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:13,005
雷
Ray.

1172
01:23:13,005 --> 01:23:15,012
我看到了
I see it!

1173
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:20,099
好吧 抓緊了
All right, hold on!

1174
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:23,053
我們得在它達到浪峰之前穿過去
We gotta get over it before it crests!

1175
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:17,058
快啊 快啊
Come on! Come on!

1176
01:24:20,008 --> 01:24:22,069
我們可以的 我們能行的
We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it!

1177
01:24:30,073 --> 01:24:32,030
噢 他媽的

1178
01:24:40,007 --> 01:24:41,077
雷
Ray!

1179
01:26:32,012 --> 01:26:33,082
見鬼了
Shit.

1180
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,054
這是什麼動靜
What's that noise?

1181
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:03,045
我們的位置還是不夠高
We're not high enough.

1182
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:07,092
趴...趴下 趴下 快躲起來
Get... get down! Get down! Take cover!

1183
01:27:07,092 --> 01:27:10,085
抓緊了 奧利
Hold on tight, Ollie!

1184
01:27:13,022 --> 01:27:15,033

01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:56,040
奧利
Ollie.

1188
01:28:12,018 --> 01:28:14,012
水勢還在上漲
The water's still rising.

1189
01:28:14,012 --> 01:28:15,089
我們還得往上走
We have to get higher.

1190
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:17,095
這邊
This way!

1191
01:28:17,096 --> 01:28:19,052
本
Ben.

1192
01:28:19,052 --> 01:28:21,096
奧利 來 抓緊了
Ollie, come. Grab on.

1193
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:49,042
噢 我的天啦
Oh, my God.

1194
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:59,016
她會在哪兒呢 雷
Where is she, Ray?

1195
01:28:59,016 --> 01:29:01,000
她是個聰敏的孩子
She's a smart girl.

1196
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,077
她肯定會找個高處躲起來
She'd know to head for one of these high-rises.

1197
01:29:03,077 --> 01:29:05,000
嗯
Hm.

1198
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,074
我們一定得找到她
We just gotta find her.

1199
01:29:19,012 --> 01:29:20,088
你還好吧
Are you all right?

1200
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:23,029
讓我們來檢查一下你腿上的傷勢
We need to take a look at that leg.

1201
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:25,072
奧利 看能找到點什麼東西
Okay. Ollie, see If there's something

1202
01:29:25,072 --> 01:29:27,069
我們可以用來做繃帶
that we can use as a bandage.

1203
01:29:27,069 --> 01:29:29,066
再看看能不能找到點乾淨的水
And see If you can find clean water.

1204
01:29:29,066 --> 01:29:30,076
好的
Yeah.

1205
01:29:30,076 --> 01:29:32,036
好拉
Okay.

1206
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:39,097
好拉 讓我們看看情況怎麼樣
Okay. Let's see what we're dealing with here.

1207
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:50,065
怎麼了
What?

1208
01:29:50,065 --> 01:29:58,009
你實在太...太不可思議了
You're absolutely... Unbelievable.

1209
01:30:14,057 --> 01:30:17,011
老媽肯定會喜歡她的
Mum's going to love her.

1210
01:30:19,094 --> 01:30:22,088
我找到幾條毛巾
There are a few towels in here.

1211
01:30:22,088 --> 01:30:24,005
噢 太好了
Oh, great.

1212
01:30:24,005 --> 01:30:27,008
我再去找點水
I'll look for some water.

1213
01:30:55,065 --> 01:30:59,008
跳過來 快
Just jump! Come on!

1214
01:30:59,008 --> 01:31:00,075
我接住你了
I got you.

1215
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
布賴恩特大街

1216
01:31:23,091 --> 01:31:28,085
嘿 我看到有人駕著船
Hey! I can see some people in a boat!

1217
01:31:33,062 --> 01:31:36,075
不會吧 不會吧
No way. No way!

1218
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:39,066
那是我父母
Those are my parents!

1219
01:31:39,066 --> 01:31:41,072
媽媽 爸爸
Mom! Dad!

1220
01:31:41,073 --> 01:31:43,009
- 媽媽 - 救命啊
- Mom! - Help!

1221
01:31:43,009 --> 01:31:44,086

01:31:50,097 --> 01:31:54,067
媽媽
Mom!

1224
01:31:56,067 --> 01:31:58,064
他們聽不到我們
They can't hear us.

1225
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:05,062
怎麼了
What?

1226
01:32:07,085 --> 01:32:10,049
艾瑪 如果再找不到她
Em, If we don't get to her soon,

1227
01:32:10,049 --> 01:32:12,005
我們就快要沒油了
we're gonna need some gas.

1228
01:32:12,006 --> 01:32:13,099
我們還有大概一個小時 最多一個半小時的油量
We got maybe an hour, hour and a half tops before we...

1229
01:32:13,099 --> 01:32:15,026
- 雷 - 怎麼啦
- Ray. - Yeah?

1230
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:16,056
先停一下
H-hold on.

1231
01:32:28,067 --> 01:32:31,044
噢 天啦 噢 我的上帝啊 那是佈雷克
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, It's Blake!

1232
01:32:31,044 --> 01:32:34,001
- 噢 我的天啦 - 艾瑪
- Oh, my God! - Emma!

1233
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:35,091
我們終於找到她了
We found her.

1234
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:53,076
佈雷克
Blake!

1235

我抓住你了 我抓住你了
I've got you! I've got you!

1240
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:28,073
佈雷克在哪兒
Where's Blake?

1241
01:33:28,073 --> 01:33:30,037
她在後面
She's back there!

1242
01:33:36,094 --> 01:33:38,071
待在這兒別動 奧利
Stay here, Ollie.

1243
01:33:42,018 --> 01:33:44,031
佈雷克

1244

艾瑪 你來駕駛這艘船
Em, take the wheel.

1251
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:20,048
我看到了一個入口 我去找她

1252
01:34:20,048 --> 01:34:21,085

1282
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:02,040
佈雷克 不要放棄

1283
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:05,071

1293
01:40:22,028 --> 01:40:24,061
噢 天啦

1304
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:18,000
都趴下

1307
01:41:55,074 --> 01:41:56,061
我們都在這兒
We're right here.

1308
01:41:56,061 --> 01:41:58,094
呼吸呀 佈雷克 呼吸呀
Breathe, Blake. Breathe.

1309
01:41:58,094 --> 01:42:00,024

Dad and I are right here, all right?

1312
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,074
雷
Ray...

1313
01:42:36,091 --> 01:42:40,092
我的孩子呀
My baby.

1314
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:04,001
我不能再失去你了
I'm not gonna lose you, too.

1315
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:05,057
絕不
No.

1316
01:43:05,058 --> 01:43:06,064
加油
Come on.

1317
01:43:11,008 --> 01:43:13,015
噢 噢 我的上帝啊
Oh. Oh, my God.

1318
01:43:14,028 --> 01:43:15,059
好啦 好啦
Okay. Okay.

1319
01:43:20,012 --> 01:43:21,049
媽媽
Mom.

1320
01:43:21,049 --> 01:43:23,002
我在這兒 我就在這兒
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1321
01:43:23,003 --> 01:43:24,089
嗯
Yeah.

1322
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,037
沒事兒了 沒事兒了 沒事兒了
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1323
01:43:49,095 --> 01:43:52,032
現在我們可以更加清晰地看到
We are now getting a better picture

1324
01:43:52,032 --> 01:43:53,089
地震造成的毀壞場景
of the scale of the devastation.

1325
01:43:53,089 --> 01:43:56,009
而在很多街區我們都可以看到
And this was the sight in many neighborhoods:

1326
01:43:56,009 --> 01:43:58,049
親朋好友相擁在一起
Families and friends huddled together,

1327
01:43:58,050 --> 01:44:00,073
雖然心有餘悸 但依舊慶幸自己的劫後餘生
shaken but grateful to still be alive.

1328
01:44:00,073 --> 01:44:02,090
地質學家將會密切關注
Seismologists will be keeping a close watch

1329
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:04,057
全球地殼板塊的活動情況
on all of the world's tectonic plates

1330
01:44:04,057 --> 01:44:06,020
因為聖安德烈亞斯這場地震
as the San Andreas quake

1331
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:08,087
可能會波及全球
could have rippling effects throughout the globe.

1332
01:44:08,087 --> 01:44:10,074
讓我們再來關注一下國內的情況
Closer to home, nerves are finally calming

1333
01:44:10,074 --> 01:44:12,047
對於只是略有震感的東海岸
on the east coast where the shaking was felt hey.

1334
01:44:12,048 --> 01:44:14,041
緊張的情緒終於得到平復
Across the entire eastern seaboard.

1335
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:16,018
- 你做得非常好 - 政府的官員正在考慮建立一套...
- You did good. - Officials in Washington want to establish a new...

1336
01:44:16,018 --> 01:44:18,021
謝謝
Thank you.

1337
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:21,025
這是大家的功勞
We all did.

1338
01:44:21,025 --> 01:44:23,008
白宮
And the white house.

1339
01:44:23,009 --> 01:44:25,015
以及舊金山政府
Authorities in San Francisco are attributing

1340
01:44:25,015 --> 01:44:28,052
對那位專家致以衷心的感謝
a tremendous amount of lives saved thanks to local experts,

1341
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:32,006
正是因為他及時向大眾發出地震預警從而拯救了無數人的生命
who were able to give ample warning of the massive quake.

1342
01:44:39,014 --> 01:44:43,041
同時 灣區的災後重建工作也已經開始
Meanwhile, recovery efforts have begun in the bay area

1343
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:46,048
聯邦緊急事務管理局 國民衛隊和聯合國救援組織
where Fema, the national guard and U.N. Relief teams

1344
01:44:46,048 --> 01:44:47,088
都已經趕赴災區
have all been mobilized.

1345
01:44:47,088 --> 01:44:50,058
成千上萬的志願者
Aided by the thousands of volunteers

1346
01:44:50,058 --> 01:44:52,052
也都紛紛奔赴灣區
pouring into the state.

1347
01:45:11,077 --> 01:45:16,024
我們在天上的父 願人人都尊您的名
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name.

1348
01:45:16,024 --> 01:45:17,061
願您的天國降臨
Thy kingdom come...

1349
01:45:23,005 --> 01:45:25,098
奧利  本
Ollie. Ben.

1350
01:45:25,098 --> 01:45:30,005
我 我在船上找到了這個
I, uh, I found this on the boat.

1351
01:45:32,072 --> 01:45:37,079
謝謝
Thank you.

1352
01:45:46,037 --> 01:45:50,037

是啊 多謝你們
Yeah, thank you.

1354
01:45:51,057 --> 01:45:53,058
不客氣
You're welcome.

1355
01:45:53,058 --> 01:45:56,021
但實際上 她幫我們的更多
But it was more like she was there for us.

1356
01:45:56,021 --> 01:45:59,005
至少我這麼覺得
I think.

1357
01:46:06,032 --> 01:46:09,056
這真是讓人難以置信
This is incredible.

1358
01:46:09,056 --> 01:46:14,043
那 接下來呢
So... what now?

1359
01:46:31,045 --> 01:46:34,012
接下來我們重建家園
Now we rebuild.
