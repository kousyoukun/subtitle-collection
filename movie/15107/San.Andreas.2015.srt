?...你的眼神里?
...look in your eye

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,790
?而我有着红唇和那些优雅 都是你所爱的?
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,500
?每当我们横冲直撞 却总能和好如初?
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,170
?因为我们永远如经典般存在?
'Cause we never go out of style

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,740
?我们永不过时?
We never go out of style

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,480
?你留着长发 梳着大背头 穿着白色T恤?
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,780
?而我有着好女孩的样子 穿着紧身裙?
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

28
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,790
?每当我们横冲直撞 却总能和好如初?
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,390
?因为我们永远如经典般存在?
'Cause we never go out of style

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,120
?我们永不过时?
We never go out of style

31
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,960
啊
Aah!

32
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,910
救命
Help!

33
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,390
我知道你们都隶属于驻扎在阿富汗巴格拉姆
So, uh, I understand that you all were part

34
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,620
军事基地的五十八号救援分队
of the fifty-eighth rescue squadron staged over at bagram

35
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,660
执行空中巡逻营救任务
in Afghanistan for combat search and rescue.

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,390
是的 女士 去过两次
Yes, ma'am. Two tours.

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,770
你们现在仍然是搭档吗
And you're still flying together?

38
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,760
是的 我们感情都挺好的 像一家人一样
Yeah, we all got pretty tight over there. Wouldn't break up the family.

39
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,230
兄弟 我们像是一家的吗
Dude, do we look like family?

40
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,000
一点点吧
A little.

41
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,130
那么 在阿富汗时的救援
So, what's the biggest difference

42
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,290
和在这里的工作有什么不同吗
between rescuing over there and what you do here?

43
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,880
这里不会吃枪子儿
Not getting shot at.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,290
你真是个有趣的家伙
You're a funny guy.

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,550
可爱、机灵

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,070
是吧 一般般啦
Yeah. Not exactly.

47
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,100
呃 盖恩斯首长
Um... chief Gaines?

48
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,270
据我所知在阿富汗和洛杉矶消防局任期间
I'm told that between Afghanistan and LAFD,

49
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,740
你拯救了超过六百余人的生命
you have over six hundred documented rescues.

50
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,180
这真让人印象深刻
That's, uh...pretty impressive.

51
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,650
本职工作而已 女士
Just doin' my job, ma'am.

52
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,320
绝对服从命令
Go where they tell me to go.

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,890
很不错 你可以停止拍摄了
That's great. You can cut there.

54
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,200
她在那里
There she is.

55
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,570
峡谷太窄了
Looks pretty tight.

56
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,370
把她拉上来
Take her up.

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
风向不断在变化
Winds are variable.

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,880
在270度到300度间摇摆
Two-seven-zero to three-zero-zero.

59
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,290
风速由十节上升为十五节
Ten knots gusting to fifteen.

- 收到 直升机五号 - 那女孩叫什么
- Copy, Helo five. - What's the girl's name?

64
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,570
纳塔莉
Natalie.

65
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,240
总部 把她的手机转到我们这
Metro, connect her cell to our sat phone.

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,700
直升机五号 你们已经连上了
Helo five, you're connected.

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,540
你好
Hello?

68
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,310

来自洛杉矶消防局
of the Los Angeles fire department.

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,680
我正开着直升机在你上方
I'm piloting the chopper above you.

71
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,150
你还好吗
You holdin' up all right?

72
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,320
我不知道 感觉不太好
I don't know. I'm not feeling very well.

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,320
天哪 车子正在下滑
Oh, my God! The car is sliding.

74
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,260
纳塔莉 我需要你保持冷静 亲爱的
Natalie, I'm gonna need you to stay calm, honey.

75
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,190
- 我们现在来救你 好吗 - 好吧
- We're coming to get you, okay? - Okay.

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,660
有七英里的能见度
Seven miles visibility.

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,000
风向270 风速10节
19 winds are at two seven zero at ten knots.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,070
你只有一小时十五分钟的时间
We show you one plus one five playtime.

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,070
兄弟 我可没看到能从哪进去
Man, I don't see a way in.

80
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,410
我们得横向切入
We're gonna tip the hat.

81
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,140
横向切入吗
Tip the hat?

82
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,610
是啊 你最好抓紧了
Yeah. You might wanna hold on to somethin'.

83
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,480
出发
Here we go.

84
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,750
还能下降十五英尺
Fifteen feet out.

五英尺
Five.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,060
哇 慢点 雷
Whoa, Whoa, easy, Ray.

88
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,930
好了 差不多了
All right. You got it.

89
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,940
好了 开工了 伙计们
All right. Tuck 'em in, boys.

90
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,440
乔比 别用吊篮
Joby, forget the basket.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,680
我们这次得用上双重固定
We gotta do a double tie-in on this one.

92
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,980
车子要是掉下去了 她也就完了
That car goes, so does she.

93
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,590
门开了
Door's open.

94
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,430
拿上这个
Get this.

95
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,960
绳索固定
Hookin' up.

96
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,370
已经就位了
On the skid.

97
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,940
我们最多只有五分钟
We got five minutes max.

98
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,510
超过五分钟会怎样
What happens in five minutes?

99
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,750
没什么 只不过引擎会熄火
It's no big deal. Just engine failure.

100
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,550
好在我只要三分钟
Good thing I only need three.

101
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,030
- 谢天谢地 - 不 不 纳塔莉 别...
- Oh, thank God. - No, no! Natalie, do not...

102
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,590
天哪 天哪 把我救出去
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Get me out of here.

103
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,530
纳塔莉 我需要你一动不动地待着
Natalie, I need you to stay perfectly still.

104
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,130
- 我要先稳定住汽车 好吗 - 快点 求你了
- I have to stabilize the car, okay? - Hurry, please.

105
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,540
车子固定好了
Car secured.

106
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,650
挂住了
Got it.

107
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,790
怎么回事
What the hell?

108
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,860
该死
Shit.

109
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,600
哇 哇
Whoa, Whoa!

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,970
迪伦 天哪 你没事吧
Dylan! Oh, my God. Are you all right?

111
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,170
天哪 乔比被卡住了
Jesus. Joby's pinned!

112
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,210
啊 该死的
Ah, goddamn it.

113
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,580
乔比 我现在下来
Joby, I'm comin' down.

114
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,820
哈里森 你来驾驶 马库斯 给我装上安全绳
Harrison, you're flyin'. Marcus, rig me a rope.

115
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,890
- 移交驾驶权 - 收到
- Handin' over. - Roger.

116
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,160
已接手
Takin' over.

117
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,130
- 随时切断绳子 - 收到
- Be ready to cut. - Roger that.

118
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,770
钩上了
Hooked up.

119
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,610
出舱门
Out the door.

120
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,040
我准备好了
Ray's clear.

121
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,090
纳塔莉 别担心 我会把你救出...
Natalie, don't you worry. I'm gonna get you outta...

122
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,190
啊
Aaah!

123
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,860
直升机撑不住了
This thing isn't gonna hold!

124
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,270
雷 红色警报 我们要坠机了
Ray, we are in the red! We are going to crash!

125
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,630
纳塔莉 我们现在就出去
Natalie, we are going now!

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,970
我抓住你了
I got you.

127
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,380
切绳子 乔比 快甩开
Cut it! Joby, swing!

128
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,990
太好了
Yeah!

129
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,260
我们现在送你回家怎么样
What do we say we get you home now.

130
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,230
我觉得这主意实在不错
I think that's a really good idea.

131
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,700
发生在日本的仙台地震被认为是
Now the sendai quake in Japan was considered to be

132
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,340
1900年以来最强的五大地震之一
one of the five strongest since 1900.

133
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,340
威力巨大 事实上
It was so powerful, in fact,

134
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,680
它将日本的本土移动了八英尺
that it moved the main island of Japan eight feet.

135
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,080
这仅仅是每年发生在全球范围内
This is just one of the 1.3 million earthquakes

136
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,550
130万起地震中的一次而已
that occur around the globe each year.

137
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,960
北美最大的一次地震发生于1964年
The largest ever recorded here in North America:

138
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,160
在阿拉斯加州的安克雷奇 有9.1级
Anchorage, Alaska, 1964. A 9.1.

139
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,130
地震持续了有五分钟
The earth shook for five straight minutes.

140
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,500
释放出的能量
The energy release

141
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,270
相当于一千万等量的原子弹
was the equivalent of ten million atom bombs

142
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,870
等同于在日本广岛投下的原子弹
the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.

143
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,110
但那不是史上记载最强的一次地震
And that's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded.

144
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,580
最强的一次是在四年前
No, the biggest was four years earlier

145
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,480
发生在智利南部的瓦尔迪维亚
off the coast of Valdivia in Southern Chile.

146
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,120
达到了9.5里氏震级
A 9.5 on the Richter scale.

147
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,950
就是那
Right there.

148
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,620
砰
Bam.

149
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,960
这次地震持续了十一分钟
This quake lasted eleven minutes and spawned a Tsunami

150
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,190
引起了82英尺的海啸 并将八千英里外的
eighty-two feet high that leveled hilo, Hawaii,

151
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,960
夏威夷西部夷为平地
eight thousand Miles away.

152
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,370
那可是八千英里之外啊
Eight thousand Miles away.

153
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,500
所以 嗯 正是因为地震有着
So, um, It's... It's mass destruction like this

154
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,170
如此之大的破坏性
that shows just how important

155
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,610
才显示出我们的研究和工作有多重要
the research that we're doing here is,

156
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,880
因为我们要能够预测地震
because we need to be able to predict these things.

157
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,710
对吗 可以提前应对
Right? To plan and prepare for them.

158
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,480
- 这位女士 - 教授 您认为
- Yes, ma'am. - Professor, do you think

159
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,320
那样的事情会发生在这里吗
something that intense could happen here?

160
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,790
额 圣安第斯断层
Well, the San Andreas fault

161
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,260
经过加利福尼亚附近
runs right up the spine of California.

162
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,860
两个构造板块的分界线
It's the demarcation line

163
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,790
近些年不断的在移动着
between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving.

164
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,300
再加上大约150年才会发生一次
Well, and add to that the fact that It's supposed to happen

165
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,370
较为严重的地震
every one hundred and fifty years

166
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,540
而我们已经安稳一百多年
and we're about a hundred years overdue.

167
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,470
我想说 这不是会不会发生的问题
I'd say It's not a matter of If.

168
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,380
而是何时会发生
It's a matter of when.

169
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,680
该死的 哥斯拉
Damn, Godzilla.

170
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,410
这次你们又对直升机做了什么
What the hell did you do to her this time?

171
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,150
和轿车玩了个小小的拔河比赛而已
Played a little tug of war with a car.

172
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,480
你要多久能把它修好
How soon before you get her fixed?

173
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,920
我今天会给马丁内斯打电话的
I'll call Martinez today.

174
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,520
干脆给你换件新的算了
Get a new one sent over to maintenance.

175
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,990
埃尔金 别走太快 小心你的屁股
Elgin, you move any faster, you're gonna break that hip.

176
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,130
洛杉矶消防局

177
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,300
哈里森说你要和布雷克一起休息几天
Harrison said you're taking off with Blake for a few days.

178
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
对 明天就走
Yeah. Leavin' tomorrow.

179
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,830
开车送她回去上学
Driving her back up to school.

180
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,870
周末排球队第一场比赛就开始了
Volleyball team has their first game this weekend,

181
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,350
洛杉矶消防局
驻扎地412

182
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,570
所以我想我们可以在海岸上玩一圈 露个营
so I figured we'd cruise up the coast. Do a little campin'.

183
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,070
伙计 我真不敢相信她已经上大学了
Dude, I can't believe she's in college already.

184
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,800
加州理工学院

185
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,800
地震学实验室 F 

186
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,800
劳伦斯・海耶斯

基姆・帕克

188
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,140
我懂 时光飞逝 兄弟
I know. Too fast, brother.

189
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,810
- 我等会来找你 - 好的 伙计
- I'll catch you inside. - All right, man.

190
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,450
劳伦斯 你快看看这个
Lawrence, I gotta show you something.

191
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,390
什么 啊 小事情
Yeah? Aha. Easy. Easy.

192
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,360
我们刚刚发现了一个罕见的低级地震群
Now, we got a rare low-level seismic swarm

193
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,490
在内华达州的法尔科
out in Falco, Nevada.

194
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,530
24小时之内发生了23次小地震
Twenty-three small quakes, all tiny.

195
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,730
都很小 震级在2.0级到2.6级
2.0 to 2.6 in the last twenty-four hours.

196
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,430
好吧 内华达州的法尔科在哪啊
Okay. Where the hell is Falco, Nevada?

197
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,670
维加斯东南大约35英里
Thirty-five Miles southeast of Vegas,

198
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,700
或许离胡佛水坝五英里
maybe five Miles from the hoover dam.

199
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,770
好吧
Right.

200
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,770
那里没有断层啊
There aren't any faults out there.

201
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,970
不包括未知的啊
Any known faults.

202
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,080
如果我们现在过去 而那些迷你的地震还在持续的话
Now, If we get there while the mini quakes continue,

203
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,140
就可以测试我们的理论了
we can test our theory.

204
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,150
如果在地震前磁脉冲率上升的话
And If the magnetic pulse rate goes up before the quakes...

205
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,350
那么我们可以提前预测
Then we're predicting them.

206
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,580
我们可以提前预测
Then we are predicting them.

207
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,590
好了 让我们一探究竟吧
All right. Let's go check it out.

208
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,770
- 嗨 爸爸 - 嘿 亲爱的
- Hi, dad. - Hey, sweetie.

209
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,340
我在想还有没有地方放我的自行车
I was wondering If there was room for my bike.

210
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,780
我想我可以骑自行车去上课
I thought that I could ride it to class

211
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,850
这样我就不用花钱买停车证了
and then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.

212
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,110
好主意啊
That's a great idea.

213
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,150
我敢肯定我可以找到方法搞定的
I'm sure I could figure out a way to fit it in.

214
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,250
好的 很好
All right, great.

215
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,420
嗯 我在妈妈这里找不到钥匙
Um, I can't find the key to the lock at mom's,

216
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,820
可能是我落在化妆台左上角的抽屉里了
so It's either in the top left drawer of my dresser

217
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,290
也可能在我衣柜上面的粉红鞋盒里
or on top of the wardrobe in my pink shoe box.

218
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,360
好的 没问题 我会找到的
Okay, no problem. I'll find it.

219
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,790
今天有计划了吗
Don't know If you have plans tonight,

220
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,260
我想带你去吃晚餐
but I would love to take you to dinner.

221
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,330
你也可以把妈妈带着一起
You could even invite your mom along.

222
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,930
- 会很有趣的 - 噢 谢了 老爸
- Could be fun. - Oh, thanks, dad.

223
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,940
但我们已经计划和丹尼尔一起
But we already have plans with Daniel.

224
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,510
爸爸
Dad?

225
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,210
- 你还好吗 - 当然 我没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah, of course I am.

226
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,550
我好着呢 没问题
Totally cool. No problem at all.

227
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,680
好的 那我们明天见吧
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

228
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,650
好的
Okay.

229
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,420
噢 别忘了我的自行车钥匙
Oh, and don't forget the bike key.

230
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,480
不会忘的 放心
I won't. I got it.

231
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,650
再见 爸爸 爱你
Bye, dad. I love you.

232
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,090
我也爱你 宝贝
Okay. I love you, too, honey.

233
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,590
再见
Bye.

234
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,780
快过来 小家伙们 我们照张相
Come here, you guys. Let's take a picture.

235
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,230
劳伦斯 真是不可思议
Lawrence, It's incredible.

236
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,560
这是自我们来这之后第三次迷你地震了
This is the third mini quake since we've been here.

237
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,430
磁脉冲率上升的速度
And the magnetic pulse rate has increased

238
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,470
比之前都快
before each one of them.

239
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,730
我们找到规律了 朋友
We got a pattern, my friend.

240
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,240
是2.0级 我们真的预测到了
That was a 2.0. Our model's predictive.

241
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,210
哦 我们做到了 朋友 终于做到了
Oh! We got it right, man! Finally!

242
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,310
没错 我们成功了
Yep, we sure did.

243
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,980
噢 该死的
Oh, shit.

244
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,220
怎么了
What's wrong?

245
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,590
脉冲率又一次飙升了 这次很强烈
Pulse rates are spikin' again. They're huge.

246
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,190
你开玩笑吗
Are you serious?

247
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,460
基姆
Kim?

248
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,430
我们要遇到大地震了
We're about to have a major quake.

249
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,300
震级跳到7.1级了
It jumped to a 7.1!

250
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,200
我的天 基姆
Jesus, Kim!

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,140
快点离开那儿
Get the hell outta there!

252
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,880
所有人都快从大坝下去 快走 快
Everybody get off the dam! Move! Now! Now!

253
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,290
所有人都快点走 快点
Everybody off! Hurry up!

254
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,360
快到安全障碍后面来
Stay behind the barriers!

255
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,930
快点 快点 到安全障碍后面来
Come on! Come on! Come on! Stay behind the barriers!

256
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,370
基姆 快啊
Kim! Hurry!

257
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,670
快过来 我带你走
Come here. I got ya.

259
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,190
基姆 快跑啊
Kim! Hurry up!

260
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,260
劳伦斯
Lawrence!

261
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,480
基姆
Kim!

262
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,250
别 别动
No! No!

263
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,050
把眼睛闭起来吧
Close your eyes.

264
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,680
你没事吧
Are you okay?

265
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,840
内华达州南部今天发生强烈地震
The Southern part of Nevada was rocked today

266
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,570
地震专家称之为
by what seismologists are calling

267
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,440
本地区发生过的最为强烈的一次地震
the most destructive earthquake ever reported in that area.

268
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,150
官方报道称胡佛水坝已被完全摧毁
Officials are saying that hoover dam is a total loss.

269
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,520
哈瓦苏湖城 尼德尔斯 布莱斯和劳克林
Lake Havasu city, needles, blythe and Laughlin

270
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,320
也遭受了重大损失
also suffered major damage.

271
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,520
来自洛杉矶的救援

is expected to begin arriving in the next 24 hours.

274
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,930
- 报道称 损失总量为 - 嗨 爸爸
- Reports that the total loss... - Hi, dad.

275
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,200
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, honey.

276
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,060
我们刚刚看到新闻了
We just saw the news.

277
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,670
我知道 我很抱歉
I know. I'm so sorry.

278

我们明天就要出发了
We're headin' out tomorrow.

279
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,600
没关系 我知道的 这次太严重了 爸爸
No, I get it. This one's really bad, dad.

280
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,270
是啊 太可怕了
Yeah, this one's tough.

281
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,410
在地震期间 地震的强度
Earthquakes can rise and fall in intensity

282
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,280
会随着持续时间而有所增减
during their duration depending on the way...

283
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,410
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

284

这房子真不错啊
Heck of a place you got here, man.

288
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,420
- 啊 谢谢 - 不客气
- Ah, thank you. - Welcome.

289
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,960
那么 嗯 爸爸明天就要出发去内华达州了
So, um... dad is heading to Nevada tomorrow.

290
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,890
发生这样的事情真是可怕
Oh, It's terrible what happened.

291
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,660
在那儿要注意安全 好吗
Please be safe over there, okay?

292
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,960
好的 我们会的 还有 宝贝 我保证我会补偿你的
Yeah, we will. And I promise I'm gonna make it up to you, honey.

293
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,630
爸爸 真的没关系的
Dad, It's really no problem.

294
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,370
我开车没那么糟的
The drive is not that bad.

295
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,540
等等 为什么不让我带你过去呢
Wait. Why don't I take you up there.

296
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,710
我要飞旧金山参加个会仪
I'm flying up to San Francisco for a meeting.

297
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,240
然后我们可以一起去西雅图
We can head up to Seattle right after.

298
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
还能给我个看你那排球赛的机会
It'll give me an opportunity to catch a volleyball game.

299
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
好主意
That's a good idea.

300
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,450
还可以让你妈妈整理她的东西
And it'll give your mom a chance

301
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,610
省的我在碍手碍脚的
to get all her stuff moved in without me in the way.

302
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,680
好吧
Right.

303
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,990
你们要搬进来了吗
You guys movin' in?

304
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,720
是啊 我 我是想过要告诉你
Yeah. I-I was meaning to tell you,

305
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,590
但我们都没有机会
but we haven't had a chance to...

306
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,190
祝喜你们了
Congratulations.

307
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,830
谢谢你
Thank you.

308
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,630
谢谢
Thanks.

309
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,870
太好了
That's great.

310
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,030
整片社区都被冲毁了
Entire communities washed away.

311
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,340
到那儿以后打给我
Call me when you get there.

312
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,740
- 我会的 - 好的
- I will. - All right.

313
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,070
爸爸 我爱你 你一定要小心
I love you, dad. You be careful, please.

314
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,180
我会的 我会的 我也爱你
I will, I will. I love you, too.

315
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,580
当地政府提醒 可能还会
Local authorities caution that there could still be...

316
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,410
我去给她拿自行车
I'll get her bike.

317
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,580
很抱歉你们不能一起走
I'm sorry you guys can't go up there together.

318
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,680
我也感觉很糟糕
Yep. Me, too.

319
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,790
雷 雷
Ray. Ray.

320
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
我是想告诉你的
I was gonna tell you.

321
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,490
我们也是刚刚做的决定
We just decided to do it.

322
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,400
别多想了
Don't worry about it.

323
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,440
嘿 如果你想
Hey, If you want them...

324
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,270
我也会签好离婚协议给你的
I'll get those papers signed for you, too.

325
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,000
当时是周日下午
Um, it was a Sunday afternoon.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,830
大家很显然都没有上班
Um, obviously, people weren't at work.

327
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,330
也没有睡觉
They weren't as... asleep.

328
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,470
即便如此 我们知道这次的破坏程度相当
Even so, we know the devastation was fairly...

329
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,600
太糟了
This is bad.

330
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,670
是啊
Yeah.

331
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,140
我们什么时候出发
What time we headin' out?

332
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,910
下午两点半 弟兄们都在准备救援装备
Fourteen-thirty. Guys are preppin' the gear now.

333
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,610
好了 开始工作吧
All right. Let's get to work.

334
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,480
这次的救援行动困难重重
It's a fairly sophisticated rescue operation underway.

335
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,350
这个叫丹尼尔的送布雷克过去
So this Daniel guy's taking Blake now?

336
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,250
我要是你的话就请病假了
I woulda just called in sick.

337
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,650
所以说我是头儿 你不是
Uh, It's why I'm the boss and you're not.

338
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,890
就算没有你的话 我们自己也能撑几天的
Oh, pretty sure we can manage a few days without ya.

339
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,530
鞋带松了
Shoe's untied.

340
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,830
哈哈哈
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

341
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,170
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?!

342
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,910
布雷克
Blake.

343
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,880
我想让你知道
I want you to know that I respect

344
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,220
我尊重你和你爸爸的感情
what you and your dad have.

345
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,890
我也知道你一下子很难
And I know that your mom moving in

346
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,390
接受我和你妈妈住在一起
has to feel like a pretty big step.

347
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,520
但我从未想过破坏你和你父亲的关系
But I'm never gonna try to change

348
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,360
或者取代他的位置
what you have with him or take his place.

349
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,830
好吗
Okay?

350
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,530
好的
Yeah.

351
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,430
很好 当然
Okay, cool.

352
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,540
嘿  你为什么一直没有孩子呢
Hey, how come you never had kids?

353
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,510
我有啊
Oh, I did.

354
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,710
这是其中一个
This is one of them right here.

355
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,410
她是旧金山空中一道
She's a pretty nice addition

356
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,880
- 亮丽的风景线 你不觉得吗 - 天门
- to the San Francisco skyline, don't you think? - "The gate."

357
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,510
- 很顺口 对吧 - 是啊 我很喜欢
- Catchy, right? Yeah, I like it.

358
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,450
妈妈跟我说过
Mom was telling me about this.

359
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,520
她说这是城中最高的建筑物 对吗
She said It's the tallest building in the city, right?

360
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,260
完工后不仅是最高的
When It's finished, it'll be the tallest,

361
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,230
也是最结实的 而且已经卖出了百分之八十
strongest and It's already eighty percent sold.

362
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,160
但说实话 我一直忙着盖楼
But, honestly, I guess I never had any kids

363
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,500
这也许就是我一直没有孩子的原因
'cause I was always so busy raising these.

364
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,270
妈妈发短信来了 她说她今天要和你妹妹一起吃午饭
Mom texted. She's having lunch with your sister today.

365
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,980
是啊 她只在城里呆几天
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days

366
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,240
真的很想见你妈妈
and really wanted to meet her.

367
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,810
不过我有点紧张
I'm a little nervous though.

368
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,820
苏珊对我保护欲有点过强了
Susan can be kind of overprotective.

369
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,120
谢谢
Thank you.

370
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,790
乔纳森
Jonathan.

371
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,090
早上好 里迪克先生
Good morning, Mr. Riddick.

372
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,290
早上好 你一个人能行吗 布雷克
Morning. Gonna be okay, Blake?

373
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,960
行的 我没事
Yeah, I'll be fine.

374
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,540
你好
Hi.

375
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,640
你好
Hello.

376
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,960
我很抱歉 劳伦斯 我能帮什么忙吗
I'm sorry, Lawrence. Can I get you anything?

377
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,760
不用 我没事 阿列克谢 谢谢你
No. I'm fine, Alexi. Thank you.

378
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,960
你确定你想留在这里吗
Are you sure you want to be here?

379
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,960
这样可以转移我的注意力
I can use the distraction, actually.

380
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,300
什么事
Yeah?

381
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,330
外面来了个记者
There's a reporter outside.

382
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,840
她说自己在做一个关于内华达地震的报道
Says she's doing a segment on what happened in Nevada.

383
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,570
哦
Oh.

384
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,180
那我现在就去告诉她 改天再说
I'm gonna tell her that It's not a good time.

385
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,780
不 等等
No, wait a minute.

386
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,910
基姆为此付出了生命
Kim gave his life for this.

387
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,220
人们需要知道
People need to know

388
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,020
我们现在可以预测这些事
that we can predict these things now.

389
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,620
想要一本吗
You want a copy?

390
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,530
我有差不多一千本库存
I got about a thousand in storage.

391
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,860
地震之前 大概没有人会相信我们的话
No one listens to us until the ground shakes, I guess.

392
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,400
他们把你同事的遭遇告诉我了
You know, they told me what happened to your colleague.

393
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,730
我们不必现在就进行采访
We don't have to do this now.

394
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,140
不 就现在
Yeah, we do.

395
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,640
我们准备好了
We're good to go.

396
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,540
- 好的 - 好的
- Okay. - 'Kay.

397
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,710
开始
Rolling.

398
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,310
第一个问题 为什么
First question. How come

399
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,840
没有人预测出内华达州的灾难
no one saw what happened in Nevada coming?

400
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,850
因为我们不知道那里有断层线
Because we didn't know there were any fault lines out there.

401
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,050
为什么不知道
Why not?

402
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,390
与主流观点相悖
Contrary to popular belief,

403
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,420
科学家并非无所不知
scientists don't know everything.

404
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,320
我了解到 你曾经公开表示过 有一天
I understand that you publicly stated that, someday,

405
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,060
科学家们 将有能力准确的预测到地震
scientists will be able to predict earthquakes.

406
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,760
事实上 到昨天为止
Well, actually as of yesterday,

407
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,700
我们一直都相信我们可以做出预测
we now believe that we can predict them.

408
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,100
教授
Professor!

409
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,200
能跟你谈谈吗
Talk to you a sec?

410
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,100
好的 很抱歉 失陪一下
Yeah. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

411
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,640
怎么了
What is it?

412
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,340
这是我们监测站的磁脉冲率
Current pulse rates at our monitoring stations.

413
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,980
都沿着圣安德烈亚斯的断层线
All along the San Andreas fault.

414
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,480
平均数值从82增长至85
Their averages are spiking from eighty-two to eighty-five,

415
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,880
峰谷差位于旧金山
with the biggest jumps coming from San Francisco.

416
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,080
比我们在内华达州地震观测到的
More than twenty points higher

417
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,320
要高出20个点
than what we saw in Nevada.

418
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,490
不不不 这不可能
No. No, no, no. There's no way.

419
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,850
我们查了两遍
We checked. We double-checked.

420
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,560
我们重置了所有仪器
Then we reset all the instruments

421
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,390
查了第三遍 结果一样
and triple-checked. Those are the counts.

422
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,890
等一下
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

423
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,760
等等
Wait a minute.

424
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,300
呃
Um...

425
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,030
好的 呃
Okay, uh...

426
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,100
如果 呃
If, uh...

427
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,370
如果我们画一条线 从圣安德烈亚斯底部
If we draw a line from the bottom of the San Andreas

428
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,640
直通到胡佛大坝
up to the hoover dam,

429
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,180
可以发现这条线几乎是沿着科罗拉多河的
it almost literally follows the Colorado river,

430
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,680
而那条河流是自然变形造成的
which is a natural deformation event.

431
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,790
从地理角度看 变形通常发生在大陆板块边缘
And geologically, deformation events mark boundaries.

432
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,460
它们能标记出界限
They mark boundaries.

433
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,130

718
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,320
快离开这里
We have to get away from these buildings.

719
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,760
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

720
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,660
布雷克! 这边 走这边!
Blake! This way! This way!

721
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,300
上帝啊 我的天!
Jesus! Oh, my God!

722
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,040
奥利! 布雷克!
Ollie! Blake!

723
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,480
快! 走 走!
Come on! Go! Go!

724
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,750
真想不到丹尼尔会扔下我不管
I cannot believe that Daniel just took off.

725
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,060
真是个混蛋
What an asshole.

726
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,590
请路上的人让开 让开
Step aside, people.

727
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,460
我得尽快联系我父母
I gotta get ahold of my parents.

728
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,100
让他们知道我没事
I gotta let them know I'm okay.

729
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,130
电话打不通 我试过了
Cellphones aren't working. I've tried.

730
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,500
我们得找一家电器商店
We need to find an electronics store.

731
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,540
你们的书上有购物指南吗?
Does that book of yours list businesses?

732
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,040
我的书里什么都有
My book has everything.

733
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,010
好消息是 我们大部分的应急系统
The good news is most of our emergency systems

734
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:20,850
还在运作 在这里
are still working. Here.

735
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,620
我们从17个监控器中检测到了信号
We've got signals coming in from seventeen monitors.

736
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,720
我们刚刚经历了一场9.1级强震
We just experienced a 9.1.

737
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,630
劳伦斯... 来看看这个
Lawrence... You need to see this.

738
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,570
获取到什么了?
What do we got?

739
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,800
这是震前采集的波频率数据
Here are the pulse rates before the quake.

740
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,040
好的
Yeah, okay.

741
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,010
这是目前的波频率
And here are the pulse rates now.

742
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,310
相同
The same.

743
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,640
甚至更高
Or higher.

744
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,650
所以地震并没有减弱
So the earthquake didn't diminish them.

745
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,250
噢 天哪
Oh, man.

746
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,190
噢 情况不妙
Oh, this is not good.

747
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,120
阿列克谢 把所有还在断层上运作的监测站数据
Alexi, I want all the data from every monitoring station

748
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,920
现在全部汇报给我
still up along the fault line and get it for me now.

749
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,490
- 好的 - 出什么事了?
- Right. - What's going on?

750
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,860
该死
Shit.

751
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,170
噢 天 都摔坏掉了
Oh, man. This thing's fried.

752
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,130
快点 我需要所有人的帮忙
Come on. I need everybody.

753
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,440
- 我们要做什么? - 让你来广播
- W-what are we doing? - Gettin' you on the air.

754
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,770
我们要通知所有人
We need to warn people.

755
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,570
要怎么做? 信号都中断了
How? There's no way to upload a signal.

756
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,210
这里可是加州理工学院
You're at Caltech.

757
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,850
好了 你们谁想在独立研究课上得A?
Okay, who wants an A in independent study?

758
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,320
我开一门新课:
I'm startin' a new class:

759
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,760
"如何通过入侵电视台来拯救人类"
"How to save lives by hacking media outlets."

760
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,290
哦不错 我参加
Hell yeah, man. I'm in.

761
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,160
很好 带上笔记本电脑 出发
Sweet, bro. Get your laptop. Let's go.

762
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:47,040
在这边 快快快
Right here. Move, move, move.

763
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,240
好了 起
Here we go. Up. Lift.

764
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,710
应该不远了
It should be just up ahead.

765
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,780
就在那儿
There it is.

766
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,360
好 任何需要靠电运作的东西都不能用
Okay, anything running on electricity isn't gonna work,

767
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,460
所以我们要找一个拨盘的或者按键的电话
so we have to find a rotary or a push button phone.

768
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,560
你怎么知道这些的?
How do you know all this?

769
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,930
我爸爸教我的 他在洛杉矶消防局工作
My dad. He works for L.A. fire and rescue.

770
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,140
在这呢
Over here.

771
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,710
太好了 我找找通讯线
Great. I'll look for a landline.

772
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,360
找到了!
I got one!

773
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,170
爸爸
Dad.

774
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,500
爸爸 我出来了 我没事
Dad. I got out. I'm okay.

775
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,140
她没事
She's okay.

776
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,710
让我和她说说话
Oh. Let me talk to her.

777
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,240
布雷克?
Blake?

778
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,840
妈妈?
Mom?

779
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,910
噢 感谢上帝 亲爱的
Oh, thank God, honey.

780
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,250
丹尼尔还好吗?
Is Daniel okay?

781
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,590
他丢下我跑了 妈妈
He left me, mom.

782
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:12,790
他怎么了?
He what?

783
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,520
他告诉保安我的位置
He told a security guard where I was

784
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,160
然后就丢下我不管了
and then he just took off

785
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,890
有一对兄弟听到了谈话
and these two brothers that I met overheard him

786
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,660
就赶过来救了我
and they came to help me.

787
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,360
我现在和他们在一起
I'm with them right now.

788
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,700
他把她丢下了
He left her?!

789
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,270
我们这就过去接你 亲爱的 你在哪?
We're comin' to get you, honey. Where are you?

790
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,600
我在唐人街的一家电器店里
I'm in an-an electronics store in Chinatown.

791
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,910
亲爱的 会没事的
Honey, It's gonna be okay

792
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,470
但是你听我说
but I need you to listen to me.

793
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,780
快出去
Getting outta there

794
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,610
那边马上就会堵得死死的
is gonna be a complete gridlock nightmare,

795
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:38,310
到高地上去 那里更安全
so get to higher ground. It's safer.

796
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,180
- 也方便我能看见你 - 好的
- That's where I'm gonna be able to see you. - Okay.

797
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,920
还记得周末我们给马洛里过生日的地方吗?
Do you remember where we spent Mallory's birthday weekend?

798
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,050
科伊特塔?
At Coit tower?

799
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,850
是的 就是山上那座
Yeah. That-that tall

800
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,990
- 高高的水泥喷嘴一样的建筑 - 没错
- cement nozzle thing on the hill. - Exactly.

801
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,360
别停下 直接过去
Don't stop anywhere. Go there.

802
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,490
我们在那见
That's where We'll meet.

Okay. Wait, mom. Mom.

805
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,700
你和爸爸怎么在一起?
How-how are you and dad together?

806
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,440
以后再解释 好吗宝贝?
We'll explain later. Okay, honey?

807
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,500
我爱你
I love you.

808
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,080
我也爱你们 再见
I love you guys. Bye.

809
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,560
你好 我是丹尼尔
Hi, you've reached Daniel.

810
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,260
有事请留言 我会尽快回复
Please leave me a message and I'll get back to you.

811
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,560
你竟敢把我女儿扔下不管了?
You left my daughter?

812
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,860
如果你没死 我会过去亲手宰了你
If you're not already dead, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

813
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,300
干得好
Thatta girl.

814
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,270
好了 我们得离开这
All right, we need to get going.

815
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,980
那你爸爸怎么来接我们?
So how is your dad going to pick us up?

816
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,940
他驾驶直升机 正赶过来
He's on his way in a helicopter.

817
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,250
真是太酷了
That's so cool.

818
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,220
我需要你们帮我在地图上找到科伊特塔
I need you to look up Coit tower on your map.

819
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,250
轮到你打电话了
It's your turn.

820
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,290
你们的父母一定很担心
Your parents will be worried sick.

821
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,230
谢谢你
Thank you.

822
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,600
待在路面上
Stay on the street.

823
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,310
我们去哪儿?
Where are we going?

824
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,170
别挡路!
Get out of my way!

825
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,340
嘿! 那是我的地盘!
Hey! That was my spot!

826
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,390
你知道吗 你和布雷克通话的时候
You know, when you were talking to Blake

827
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,560
那是马洛里走了之后
that was the first time I heard you say Mallory's name

828
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,170
我第一次听你提到马洛里的名字
since we lost her.

829
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,840
你记得我们在旧金山旅游的时候的照片吗?
Hey, do you know that Blake keeps pictures

830
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,610
布雷克一直留着
from our San Francisco trip?

831
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,410
记得 在她的回忆盒里
Yeah, in her memory box.

832
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,880
真想不到 我们有一天还会回到那里去
It's ironic. Us heading back up there.

833
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,220
那一次很开心的旅行
It was a fun trip.

834
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,360
我们在哪?
Where are we?

835
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,330
贝克斯菲尔德 已经是一片废墟了
Bakersfield. Or what's left of it.

836
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:48,440
离旧金山大概还有90分钟的航程
We're just about ninety minutes from San Francisco.

837
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,110
雷?!
Ray?!

838
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,760
你关掉引擎了吗?
Did you just turn off the engine?

839
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,020
是的 我们的变速装置出故障了
Yeah, we got a gearbox failure.

840
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,490
肯定是刚才在洛杉矶撞到的
Must've been that hit we took in L.A.

841
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,390
现在只能自行降落了
I'm gonna have to auto rotate down.

842
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:15,500
自什么?
A-auto-what?

843
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,660
撞到地上
We're gonna crash.

844
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,940
- 好 好吧 - 抓紧了
- Right. Okay. - Hold on.

845
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,100
开始了
Here we go.

846
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,920
抓紧!
Hold on!

847
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,760
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

848
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,860
要到了 要到了
Almost there. Almost there.

849
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,700
就在那里降落
Just gonna set it down right here.

850
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,350
我们身上都是燃料 快点从这里出去
We got fuel all over us. We need to get outta here.

851
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,500
快点 离开
Come on. We gotta go.

852
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,300
- 低下身子 - 好的
- Stay low. Stay low. - Okay.

853
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,080
没事的 我们继续走
It's okay. We just gotta keep movin'.

854
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,410
继续往前 好
Just gotta keep movin'. All right.

855
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,650
给我!
Give it to me!

856
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,980
不! 这是我的!
No! It's mine!

857
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,230
快 快 快
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

858
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,340
进去 进去
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

859
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,340
这车好像是偷来的
Looks like It's been stolen.

860
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,780
好 我们再偷一次
All right. Well, We'll steal it again.

861
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,620
雷
Ray.

862
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,450
冷静点
Easy.

863
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,590
我需要那辆卡车
I'll be needin' that truck.

864
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,830
今天可不行
Not today.

865
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,700
哦 天呐
Oh, my God.

866
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,310
这次地震
The quake centered

867
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:46,110
以洛杉矶市中心东部二十英里处为中心
about twenty Miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

868
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,520
信号塔都毁了
Cell towers are down.

869
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,750
城里的大部分电力也中断了
Most of the city's electricity, down.

870
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,250
通讯处于停滞状态
Communication at a virtual standstill.

871
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,460
对加利福尼亚南部地区
The devastation to Southern California

872
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,890
造成了灾难性的破坏
is expected to be massive.

873
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,890
事实上 整个州都受到影响
In fact, the entire state will take a hit.

874
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,060
- 我们已经收到有关建筑物塌陷的报道 - 我们进去了
- We're already getting reports of collapsed buildings - We're in.

875
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,470
- 北至旧金山和海湾地区 - 太棒了
- As far north as San Francisco and the surrounding bay area. - Yes.

876
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,770
至少已经发生过五次余震了
There have been at least five aftershocks.

877
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,600
好的 我们开始了
Okay. Here we go.

878
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,370
制片人告诉我们
Uh, producers are telling us

879
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,510
我们有来自洛杉矶的首次现场直播
we have our first live feed from Los Angeles.

880
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,740
拍摄开始 五 四...
We're rolling. Five, four...

881
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,480
塞雷娜・约翰逊现在正在
Serena Johnson is on the ground

882
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,680
加利福尼亚工学院地震学中心现场
at the seismology center at caltech.

883
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,650
你好 克里斯
Hello, Chris.

884
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,450
现在坐在我身边的是
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes,

885
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,820
加利福尼亚工学院地震研究室执行理事劳伦斯・海耶斯教授
executive director for earthquake studies at caltech.

886
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,620
他和他的研究伙伴基姆帕克博士
He and his research partner, Dr. Kim park,

887
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,160
设计出了一个可以预测地震的理论模型
have come up with a model that predicts earthquakes.

888
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,560
他们预测到洛杉矶会发生地震
They knew L.A. was going to get hit.

889
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,330
可是没有人理会他们
But nobody listened to them.

890
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,100
现在让我们一起来听听吧 请说吧 教授
It's time now to listen. Go ahead, doctor.

891
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,960
好的 用地震学术语来说
Okay. Um, in seismology terms,

892
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:40,430
我们现在所经历的叫做地震群体事件
what we're experiencing is what we call a swarm event.

893
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,400
基本上来说 加利福尼亚
Um, basically, California's

894
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,440
整个地壳构造板块都移动了
entire tectonic plate has shifted.

895
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,240
目前看来 我们在洛杉矶
Yes, it seems the quake we experienced here

896
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,510
发生的地震 一路蔓延
in Los Angeles did major damage

897
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,940
对旧金山造成了极大的破坏
all the way up in San Francisco.

898
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,640
是的 不过他们感受到的地震
Yeah. Yeah, but the earthquake that they felt

899
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,350
来自中央谷
was from movement along the fault line

900
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,780
断层线的活动
in the central valley.

901
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,780
而尾部的断层线还没有开始移动
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

902
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,150
更重要的是 大家必须知道
Uh, more importantly, people need to know

903
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,690
地震尚未结束
that the shaking is not over.

904
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,660
我说的地震 而不是余震
And It's not aftershocks I'm talking about.

905
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,720
旧金山还会再次发生地震
San Francisco will get hit again.

906
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:06,560
而且会比这次的更加严重
And It's going to be a bigger monster this time.

907
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,960
我们的样机预测震级至少是9.5
Our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater.

908
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,030
震动会极为强烈 即便是在加利福尼亚
It will be so big that even though It's happening

909
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,300
发生的地震
here in California

910
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:17,870
你在东海岸也会有震感
you will feel it on the east coast.

911
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,740
所以 我在这里要郑重的提醒
Now, I cannot emphasize this enough

912
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,780
旧金山的人们
to the people of San Francisco:

913
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,150
你们得马上离开 就现在
You need to get out. And I mean now.

914
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,020
如若来不及的话 你们需要
And, If you can't, you need to find

915
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,820
找到任何何以掩护或者抓牢的东西
any means possible to drop cover and hold on.

916
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,930
因为你们能不能活下来全靠它了
Because your life is gonna depend on it.

917
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,260
愿上帝与你们同在
God be with you.

918
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,700
余震依旧
Aftershocks continue

919
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,270
摇晃着洛杉矶地区
to rock the Los Angeles area...

920
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,370
你有没有想过 要是没有失去马洛里的话
You ever think about what our life would be like.

921
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,610
我们的生活会是什么样
If we hadn't lost mallory?

922
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:55,140
专家们建议大家...
People are advised to...

923
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,250
艾玛 别这样
Em, don't.

924
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,980
我想过 每时每刻都在想
I do. All the time.

925
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,480
我们已经向前看了
We've moved on.

926
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,180
不 我们没有
No, we didn't move on.

927
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,390
我们停在了那个时刻
We stopped moving.

928
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,390
她又不是因为你没有看好而死去的
You didn't lose her on your watch.

929
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,520
确实 但是我失去她了
No. But I lost her.

930
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,790
我们能不讨论这个吗
Can we not talk about this?

931
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,630
你欠我的
You owe it to me.

932
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,930
又是这样
This!

933
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:15,430
自从她死了你几乎每天都是这样
This is the most I've gotten out of you since she died.

934
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:17,830
我真的想知道 雷
I need to know, Ray.

935
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:22,140
是因为我吗 是我做了什么吗
Was... was it me? What did I do?

936
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,070
因为我从没怪过你
Because I never blamed you.

937
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,410
我不想谈这个
I don't wanna talk about it.

938
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,180
我 这还有什么关系呢 她都不在了
I... it doesn't matter. She's gone.

939
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,480
现在你也离开了
Now you're gone.

940
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,280
还有什么意义呢
What's the point?

941
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,850
我觉得问题在于
I guess the point is

942
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:40,120
这就是我没留下的原因
this is why I didn't stick around.

943
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,690
听起来是极其严重的情况 劳丽
Sounds like a terrible situation there, Laurie.

944
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,890
我知道当时一定很艰难...
I know that it must have been very difficult...

945
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,160
嗨 注意 小心
Hey! Look out! Watch out!

946
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,930
嗨 嗨 快停下
Hey! Hey! You have to stop!

947
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,970
雷
Ray!

948
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,570
这是什么情况
What is this?

949
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:32,440
圣安德烈亚斯断层
The San Andreas fault.

950
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,990
我说过我们该走另一条路的
I told you we should've gone the other way.

951
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,960
因为你预测到了会发生这个吗
Because you knew this was gonna happen?

952
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,160
哦
Oh.

953
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,760
你
You!

954
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,630
我们真的非常感激你们
We owe you guys a huge thanks.

955
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,630
不必了
No need.

956
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:01,130
我们差点也犯了同样的错
We nearly made the same mistake ourselves

957
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,970
不过我们驶离道路的时候爆了个车轴
but busted an axle when we ran off the road.

958
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,530
多亏我视力比他的好
Thank goodness my eyes are better'n his.

959
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,180
请问这里有路能绕过去吗
Do you know If there's any way around this?

960
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,580
这个嘛 198号公路可能还行
Well, uh... the one-ninety-eight might not be out.

961
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,920
- 刚好能绕过去 - 有多远呢
- Through the pass. - How far is that?

962
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,050
你们得掉个头走 大概七十英里
Oh, ya gotta backtrack, maybe, seventy Miles or so.

963
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,100
先生 冒昧问一句
Sir, If you don't mind me Askin'...

964
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,770
你的帽子是哪来的
Where'd you get your hat?

965
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,870
你们可真帮了我们大忙了
You guys really bailed us out.

966
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,370
真的不用我们送你们去哪吗
You sure we can't fly you anywhere?

967
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,370
不用了 我们儿子住在山上
Yeah. Our son lives in the mountains.

968
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,640
那里可没地方能降落
There's no place to land.

969
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,410
多谢你的车了
Thanks for the wheels. You bet.

970
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,050
路上小心 拜
Be safe. Bye.

971
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,830
再过几分钟油就加满了
We should be fueled up in a couple of minutes.

972
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,000
好啊 太好了
Okay, great.

973
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,340
你还好吧
Everything okay?

974
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:20,880
你刚才问我是不是因为你
You asked me before If it was you.

975
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,580
其实不是
It wasn't.

976
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:28,390
我知道你不怪我
I knew you didn't blame me.

977
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:33,730
我...我只是不知道该怎么面对马洛里的死
I... I just didn't know how to deal with Mallory's death.

978
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,110
那天带马洛里去漂流是我的主意
It was my idea to take mallory rafting that day.

979
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,510
雷
Ray.

980
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:54,280
你不该这样责怪自己
You can't blame yourself for what happened.

981
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:59,520
可当出事的是自己的孩子时感觉真的太难过了
It's just different when It's your own kid.

982
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,650
我知道
I know.

983
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,220
- 爸爸 - 马洛里
- Dad! - Mallory!

984
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,730
有时候 我无法把她当时看我的表情从脑海里挥去
Sometimes I can't get that look she had outta my head.

985
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,830
就是那一刻
The moment she realized

986
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:12,100
她意识到我救不了她
that... I wasn't gonna be able to save her.

987
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:18,140
然后每天回家面对你和布雷克
And then coming home every day to you and Blake

988
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,810
只会使之变得更难
only made it harder.

989
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,550
因为我们再也回不到从前了
Because nothin' was the way it used to be.

990
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,680
而我们的从前...
And the way it used to be was...

991
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,450
是那么完美
It was perfect.

992
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,560
我本该对你敞开心扉的
I should've let you in.

993
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,800
我只是不知道该怎么做
I just didn't know how.

994
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:50,240
而我们之间却这样结束了 我很抱歉 艾玛
I'm so sorry for how things ended with us, em.

995
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,640
我真的很抱歉
I really am.

996
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,220
若是连你都救不了我们的女儿...
If you couldn't save our daughter...

997
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,850
其他人更不行
Then nobody could have.

998
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:15,630
我真的很想她
I miss her so much.

999
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:18,730
我也是
Me, too.

1000
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:26,780
去救我们的女儿吧
Let's go get our daughter.

1001
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,870
快走啊 继续走
Let's go! Keep it movin'!

1002
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,370
快走 加油 快走
Let's go! Come on. Let's go.

1003
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,270
顺着疏散路线走
Follow the evacuation route.

1004
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,770
再走几条街就到伦巴第街道
Just a few more blocks to Lombard Avenue,

1005
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,580
然后就能直接到科伊特塔
which leads to Coit tower.

1006
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,780
我能问问
Do you mind If I ask

1007
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,220
你为什么戴着两条一样的项链吗
why you wear two of the same necklaces?

1008
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:10,720
呃...
Um...

1009
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,890
其中一条是我妹妹的
One of them used to be my sister's.

1010
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:21,430
我... 自从她去世后我就开始把它戴上了
I, uh... I started wearing it after she died.

1011
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,830
在那场事故发生的前一年
We had given them to each other

1012
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,670
这是我们送给彼此的圣诞礼物
for Christmas the year before.

1013
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,170
我... 我很抱歉 我... 我不是有意...
I'm... I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean...

1014
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:32,310
没关系的 我并没打算掩饰什么
No. It's okay. I'm... I'm not hiding them.

1015
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:37,440
嗨 快看呐
Hey. Check it out.

1016
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,780
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1017
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,150
他们应该有个电源箱的
They should have a supply box.

1018
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,220
里面有我们用得上的东西
It'll have stuff that we can use.

1019
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,250
是这个吗
Is this it?

1020
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,560
没错
Yes!

1021
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,300
好 看着
Oh, okay. There we go.

1022
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,130
每个城市都有一个现场急救员
Every city has a tactical channel

1023
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,000
用来通话用的火灾指挥用频道
that first responders use to communicate on.

1024
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
我们可以留着听最新动态
We can listen in and we can see what's going on.

1025
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,400
好 拿着这些
Okay. Here. Take these.

1026
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,400
好的
Yeah.

1027
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,570
拿着这个
Take this.

1028
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:09,010
- Mre是什么 - 就是应急食品
- What's an mre? - Meals ready-to-eat.

1029
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:12,110
这些东西有三年以上的保质期
These things have a shelf life of over three years.

1030
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:13,650
尝起来不怎么样
Wow. They don't taste so good.

1031
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,750
酷
Cool.

1032
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,720
布雷克
Blake!

1033
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,290
我觉得我们可能去不了
I think we're going to have a problem

1034
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,620
你说的那个喷嘴样的地方了
with that big nozzle thing you were talking about.

1035
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:24,190
什么 你在说什么
What? What do you mean?

1036
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:27,000
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

1037
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,440
我们得启用B计划
We have to go to plan B.

1038
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,240
我们好像没有B计划吧
I didn't think we had one.

1039
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,740
现在有了
We do now.

1040
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:44,750
我们得去另外一个最高的地方
We need to get to the next highest ground

1041
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,080
给我爸爸发信号
so that we can signal my dad

1042
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,880
所以我们要去诺布山
in the helicopter. That would be Nob Hill.

1043
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,480
那是市里最高的地方
It's the highest point in the city.

1044
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,350
在另一边
It's the other way.

1045
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:52,790
走吧
Okay. Come on!

1046
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:57,760
布雷克 等一下 等一下
Bl-no. Blake, wait! Wait! Just... just wait.

1047
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,700
借过 让一让 让一让
Coming through. Move, move, move.

1048
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,650
布雷克 只有我们在往那个方向去
Blake, we'd be the only ones going that way.

1049
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,360
我爸爸说去最高的地方
My dad said to get to higher ground,

1050
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,320
那我们就去最高的地方
so that's what we gotta do.

1051
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,360
可... 要是他来不了怎么办
But... what If he doesn't make it?

1052
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,700
我知道这听起来可能有点疯狂
Listen, I know that this sounds crazy.

1053
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,100
不过你得相信他一定会来的
But you have to trust me that he will.

1054
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,940
我... 我...
I... I c...

1055
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,210
本
Ben.

1056
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:52,080
你知道按键式电话能和
Did you know about the push-button phone

1057
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,910
陆线连接起来用吗
working with the landline?

1058
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,750
电源箱
The supply box?

1059
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,920
火灾指挥用频道
Tactical radio channels?

1060
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,590
我真觉得我们应该和她一起
I really think we should stick with her.

1061
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:16,840
好吧 看来我们是要去诺布山了
Okay. Looks like we're going to Nob Hill.

1062
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,880
好的 走吧
Okay. Let's go.

1063
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,350
这条信息是加利福尼亚
The following message is transmitted at the request

1064
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,150
应急管理部门要求发送的
of the California emergency management.

1065
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,960
请居民们立刻撤离
Residents are encouraged to evacuate immediately.

1066
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,860
看来整个城市都在撤离
Looks like the whole city's evacuating.

1067
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,930
艾玛 机场好像去不了了
Em, we got a problem at the airport.

1068
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,300
那我们能从哪里降落
Where are we gonna land?

1069
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,200
没办法了
We can't.

1070
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,140
至少不能在城市里降
At least, not in the city.

1071
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,900
跟我来
Come with me.

1072
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:21,400
哦... 好的
Uh... okay.

1073
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,110
你不是开玩笑的吧
You gotta be kidding me.

1074
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,480
艾玛 我们现在没地方降落了
Em, we have no place to set this plane down

1075
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,350
我们必须尽可能的靠近科伊特塔
and we have to get as close to Coit tower as we possibly can.

1076
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,650
三分钟内 我们就会飞到内河码头上方
In three minutes, we're gonna be over the embarcadero.

1077
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,880
然后呢
And?

1078
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,490
然后我们跳到At&t运动场里去
And, we're gonna drop into AT&T park.

1079
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:41,790
可我不会跳伞
But I don't know how to parachute.

1080
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,290
没关系 我们双人串联跳伞
That's okay. We're gonna tandem-jump.

1081
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,290
我 我我觉得还是待在飞机里比较好
I-I-I think we should just stay with the plane.

1082
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,160
飞机一旦耗尽燃油
The plane's gonna nosedive in the pacific

1083
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,700
就会直接俯冲掉到太平洋里
as soon as it runs out of gas.

1084
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:52,030
那好吧
Okay. Mm.

1085
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,010
相信我
Trust me.

1086
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,410
我的天
Oh, my God!

1087
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,580
准备好了吗
You ready?

1088
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,620
- 我像准备好的样子吗 - 那是
- Do I sound ready?! - Yep!

1089
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:16,850
我有好久没没让你上二垒了
It's been a while since I got you to second base.

1090
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:21,790
随着劳伦斯・海耶斯博士的沉重警告
With a grave warning from Dr. Lawrence Hayes

1091
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,290
在电视广播上播出
blanketing the airwaves...

1092
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:26,060
旧金山已开始实施撤退方案
San Francisco has begun evacuation procedures.

1093
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,560
海岸巡逻队希望任何一个有船只的人士
The coast guard is asking anyone with access to a boat

1094
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,160
都能参与其中...
to will please volunteer in the process...

1095
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,670
断层线的活动
fault line in the central valley.

1096
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,330
而断层线的尾部还没有开始移动
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

1097
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,170
旧金山还会再次发生地震
San Francisco is going to get hit again,

1098
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,510
而且会比这次的更加严重
and this will be a much bigger monster.

1099
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,640
我真希望所有人都听到了我们的预警
I hope we've given everyone enough warning.

1100
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,140
这真是破天荒头一次
Would be the first of its kind.

1101
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,480
这就是你说的吗
This is it, isn't it?

1102
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,050
此时此刻 我希望我是错的
Right now, I wanna be so wrong.

1103
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:54,090
大家快找掩体
Everyone, take cover!

1104
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,300
这很快就会结束的
This will be over soon here.

1105
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,600
为旧金山的人们祈祷吧
But pray for the people of San Francisco.

1106
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,000
你知道吗 nob是个俚语
Did you know "nob" is a slang term

1107
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,170
意思是富裕 富有
which means "rich" or "wealthy".

1108
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,580
是"Nobility"贵族的简写
"It's a shortened version of the word 'nobility',

1109
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,680
因为住在这里的都是富有家庭
because of the families that live there.

1110
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,580
这里又被称为斯诺希尔
It is also derisively known as 'snob hill'."

1111
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,120
怎么了
what is it?

1112
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,190
丹尼尔造的那座建筑
Daniel built that building.

1113
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,660
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

1114
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:41,100
我操
Oh, shit.

1115
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:48,040
快走 快走
Move! Move!

1116
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,510
走啊 奥利
Come on, Ollie!

1117
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:03,860
奥利
Ollie!

1118
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,530
我想回家
I want to go home now!

1119
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,130
坚持住
Just hold on!

1120
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:12,130
一会就好 我保证
It's gonna be okay. I promise!

1121
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:55,510
他们在那里会丧命的
They're gonna get killed out there.

1122
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,440
艾玛 到体育场的边上去
Em, get to the side of the stadium.

1123
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,610
我马上就回来 我马上就回来
I'll be right there. I'll be right there!

1124
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,580
这里不安全 到体育场的边上去
It's not safe here. Get to the side of the stadium!

1125
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,250
马上到体育场的边上去
Go to the side of the stadium right now!

1126
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:07,320
这座楼要塌了 快走啊
This building's gonna collapse. You need to move!

1127
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,190
赶快 赶紧离开街道
Hurry! You gotta get off the street!

1128
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,090
到体育场的边上去 快啊
Get to the side of the stadium! Right now!

1129
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,690
体育场的边上去 到体育场的边上去
Side of the stadium. Get to the side of the stadium!

1130
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,900
快点 快点 快离开街道
Come on. Come on. Come on. Off the street!

1131
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,200
去体育场 到体育场的边上去
Get to the stadium. Side of the stadium!

1132
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,000
快点 离开街道
Come on! Get out of the street!

1133
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,480
没事的 有我在
It's all right! I got you.

1134
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,880
有我在 起
I got you. And up!

1135
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,150
- 这边 雷 - 带上她
- Over here, Ray! - Take her.

1136
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,850
- 带上她 艾玛 - 好的
- Here. Take her, em. - I got her!

1137
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:50,200
你会没事的 你会没事的
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

1138
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,400
会没事的
It's all right.

1139
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,500
大家都蹲下
Everybody down!

1140
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:17,490
大家都好吧 有没有人受伤
Everybody okay? Anybody hurt?

1141
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,860
没有
No.

1142
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,700
艾玛 你没事吧
Emma. You okay?

1143
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,270
没事
Yeah.

1144
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,610
你是怎么知道这里安全的
How'd you know we'd be safe?

1145
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:37,010
因为我们躲在一个坚固的东西边上
Just get up against something sturdy.

1146
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,450
想要保护好自己
Protect yourself.

1147
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:40,380
就要寻找地震活命三角区
Triangle of life.

1148
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:40,380
地震活命三角区是由加拿大人道格-库普提出的一种理论，
是指地震发生后，室内的人应该躲在大而坚实的物体旁，
这样墙体和梁倒下后能与该物体形成一个三角空间，
躲在这个空间里的人便可活命

1149
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:45,550
走吧
Let's go.

1150
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,720
她会平安无事的
She's gonna be okay.

1151
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,400
但我们要怎样才能横穿过去呢
But how do we get through that?

1152
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:38,540
我们不横穿过去 我们绕过去
We don't. We go around it.

1153
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,840
嗷
Oh.

1154
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:50,820
好了
Oh, okay.

1155
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,720
我们得把这个碎片取出来
We have to get that out of there.

1156
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,490
如果继续带着它前进的话 伤势会加重的
If you try walking with it, it could cause more damage.

1157
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,540
这会很疼的 你准备好了吗
This is gonna hurt. Are you ready?

1158
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,680
啊 啊
Gah! Ahh.

1159
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,920
本
Ben!

1160
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,260
没事儿 我没事儿
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1161
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:33,190
你觉得你还能继续前进吗
Do you think you could put some weight on it?

1162
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,860
我们得接着走 我们还得爬过那座山
We have to keep moving. We gotta get up that hill.

1163
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,430
行
Yeah.

1164
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:40,000
好的 来吧
Okay. Here.

1165
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,450
这次地震究竟有多强烈
How bad did they get hit?

1166
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,360
九点六级
9.6.

1167
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,900
有史以来最强烈的一次地震
Largest quake in recorded history.

1168
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,760
噢 不
Oh, no.

1169
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,330
这儿已经烧了一阵子了
Coit's been burning a while.

1170
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,870
她肯定逃到别的地方去了
She's gone someplace else.

1171
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,670
宝贝 你在哪儿呢 在哪儿呢
Now, where are you, baby? Where are you?

1172
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,480
你的B计划是什么
What's your plan b?

1173
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,520
噢 该死的
Oh, shit.

1174
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,920
怎么了
What's happening?

1175
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,990
我们得赶紧走
We gotta go.

1176
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:13,690
海水的波动表明海啸即将来袭
Water being pulled out like that's a Tsunami.

1177
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,700
我们得离开这个港湾 赶快
We gotta get outta the bay, now.

1178
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,740
等等 等等 等一下
Wait. Wait, wait a second,

1179
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,040
- 让我歇一下 - 让你休息一下吧
- just give me one second. - Give you a second.

1180
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,510
天啦
God!

1181
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,880
气象部门刚对加州中部和北部的沿海地区
The weather service has issued a Tsunami warning

1182
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,920
发布了海啸预警
for coastal areas of northern and central California,

1183
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,490
包括马林郡 纳帕
including the following Marin, napa,

1184
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,890
旧金山 蒙特里等城市
San Francisco and Monterey.

1185
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,670

1186
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,500
快走 我们得赶快走

1187
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,210
我们得去丹尼尔那座写字楼
We gotta get to Daniel's building.

1188
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,520
雷
Ray.

1189
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,590
我看到了
I see it!

1190
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,460
好吧 抓紧了
All right, hold on!

1191
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:24,000
我们得在它达到浪峰之前穿过去
We gotta get over it before it crests!

1192
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:18,050
快啊 快啊
Come on! Come on!

1193
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:23,160

1195
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,240
雷

1196
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:34,290
见鬼了
Shit.

1197
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,010
这是什么动静
What's that noise?

1198
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,920
我们的位置还是不够高
We're not high enough.

1199
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,390
趴...趴下 趴下 快躲起来
Get... get down! Get down! Take cover!

1200
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,320
抓紧了 奥利
Hold on tight, Ollie!

1201
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:15,800

01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,870
奥利
Ollie.

1205
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:14,590
水势还在上涨
The water's still rising.

1206
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,360
我们还得往上走
We have to get higher.

1207
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,420
这边
This way!

1208
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:19,990
本

1209
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:22,430
奥利 来 抓紧了
Ollie, come. Grab on.

1210
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:49,890
噢 我的天啦
Oh, my God.

1211
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:59,630
她会在哪儿呢 雷
Where is she, Ray?

1212
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:01,470
她是个聪敏的孩子
She's a smart girl.

1213
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,240
她肯定会找个高处躲起来
She'd know to head for one of these high-rises.

1214
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,470
嗯
Hm.

1215
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:08,210
我们一定得找到她
We just gotta find her.

1216
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,350
你还好吧
Are you all right?

1217
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:23,760
让我们来检查一下你腿上的伤势
We need to take a look at that leg.

1218
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,190
奥利 看能找到点什么东西
Okay. Ollie, see If there's something

1219
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:28,160
我们可以用来做绷带
that we can use as a bandage.

1220
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,130
再看看能不能找到点干净的水
And see If you can find clean water.

1221
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:31,230
好的
Yeah.

1222
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:32,830
好拉
Okay.

1223
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:40,440
好拉 让我们看看情况怎么样
Okay. Let's see what we're dealing with here.

1224
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,120
怎么了
What?

1225
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:58,560
你实在太...太不可思议了
You're absolutely... Unbelievable.

1226
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,580
老妈肯定会喜欢她的
Mum's going to love her.

1227
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:23,350
我找到几条毛巾
There are a few towels in here.

1228
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,520
噢 太好了
Oh, great.

1229
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,550
我再去找点水
I'll look for some water.

1230
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,550
跳过来 快
Just jump! Come on!

1231
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:01,220
我接住你了
I got you.

1232
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:29,320
嘿 我看到有人驾着船
Hey! I can see some people in a boat!

1233
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:37,220
不会吧 不会吧
No way. No way!

1234
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:40,130
那是我父母
Those are my parents!

1235
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:42,190

妈妈
Mom!

1240
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,110
他们听不到我们
They can't hear us.

1241
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:06,090
怎么了
What?

1242
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,960
艾玛 如果再找不到她
Em, If we don't get to her soon,

1243
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,520
我们就快要没油了
we're gonna need some gas.

1244
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,460
我们还有大概一个小时 最多一个半小时的油量
We got maybe an hour, hour and a half tops before we...

1245
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,730
- 雷 - 怎么啦
- Ray. - Yeah?

1246
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,030

- 噢 我的天啦 - 艾玛
- Oh, my God! - Emma!

1249
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,380
我们终于找到她了
We found her.

1250
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,230
布雷克

1256
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,200
布雷克在哪儿
Where's Blake?

1257
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,840
她在后面
She's back there!

1258
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,180
待在这儿别动 奥利
Stay here, Ollie.

1259
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,780
布雷克
Blake!

1260
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:48,260
布雷克

1261
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:53,560
不 不 不
no! No! No!

1262
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,930
这栋楼在下沉 我们得赶紧走
The building's sinking! We have to move.

1263
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:59,230
我们得往上走
We have to move up.

1264
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:00,770
快走 奥利 快
Come on, Ollie, hurry!

艾玛 你来驾驶这艘船
Em, take the wheel.

1267
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:20,950
我看到了一个入口 我去找她
I see a way in. I'm going after her.

1268
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,320

01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:34,840
没事儿了 没事儿了 没事儿了
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1339
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,790
现在我们可以更加清晰地看到
We are now getting a better picture

1340
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:54,360
地震造成的毁坏场景
of the scale of the devastation.

1341
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,560
而在很多街区我们都可以看到
And this was the sight in many neighborhoods:

1342
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,960
亲朋好友相拥在一起
Families and friends huddled together,

1343
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:01,200
虽然心有余悸 但依旧庆幸自己的劫后余生
shaken but grateful to still be alive.

1344
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,370
地质学家将会密切关注
Seismologists will be keeping a close watch

1345
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:05,040
全球地壳板块的活动情况
on all of the world's tectonic plates

1346
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,670
因为圣安德烈亚斯这场地震
as the San Andreas quake

1347
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:09,340
可能会波及全球
could have rippling effects throughout the globe.

1348
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,210
让我们再来关注一下国内的情况
Closer to home, nerves are finally calming

1349
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:12,940
对于只是略有震感的东海岸
on the east coast where the shaking was felt hey.

1350
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:14,880
紧张的情绪终于得到平复
Across the entire eastern seaboard.

1351
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,650
- 你做得非常好 - 政府的官员正在考虑建立一套...
- You did good. - Officials in Washington want to establish a new...

1352
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,680
谢谢
Thank you.

1353
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,720
这是大家的功劳
We all did.

1354
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,550
白宫
And the white house.

1355
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,620
以及旧金山政府
Authorities in San Francisco are attributing

1356
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:28,990
对那位专家致以衷心的感谢
a tremendous amount of lives saved thanks to local experts,

1357
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,530
正是因为他及时向大众发出地震预警从而拯救了无数人的生命
who were able to give ample warning of the massive quake.

1358
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:43,880
同时 湾区的灾后重建工作也已经开始
Meanwhile, recovery efforts have begun in the bay area

1359
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,950
联邦紧急事务管理局 国民卫队和联合国救援组织
where Fema, the national guard and U.N. Relief teams

1360
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:48,350
都已经赶赴灾区
have all been mobilized.

1361
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:51,050
成千上万的志愿者
Aided by the thousands of volunteers

1362
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:52,990
也都纷纷奔赴湾区
pouring into the state.

1363
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:16,710
我们在天上的父 愿人人都尊您的名
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name.

1364
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,080
愿您的天国降临
Thy kingdom come...

1365
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,450
奥利  本
Ollie. Ben.

1366
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:30,520
我 我在船上找到了这个

不客气
You're welcome.

1371
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,680
但实际上 她帮我们的更多
But it was more like she was there for us.

1372
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:59,520
至少我这么觉得
I think.

1373
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:10,030
这真是让人难以置信
This is incredible.

1374
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,800
那 接下来呢
So... what now?

1375
