# 你眼里透露着轻狂 # 
# Look in your eye #

8
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:41,299
# 我涂上了经典的红唇妆 #
# And I got that red lip classic thing that you like #

9
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,794
# 我们崩溃时 每次都能和好 #
# And when we go crashing down, we come back every time #

10
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:51,232
# 因为我们永远相配 我们永远相配 #
# 'Cause we never go out of style We never go out of style #

11
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:56,371
# 你长发飘飘 后背光滑 穿着白T恤 #
# You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt #

12
00:01:56,471 --> 00:02:01,876
# 我有好女孩该有的 也有紧身裙 #
# And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt... #

13
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:04,970
我快好奇疯了 你和乔西到底怎么了?

14
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:11,461
救命啊!
Help!

15
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,934
所以说... 我知道你们都来自驻扎在阿富汗
So... I understand that you all were part of the fifty-eighth rescue squadron

16
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:37,539
巴格拉姆基地的第58战斗搜寻中队
staged over at Bagram in Afghanistan for combat search and rescue.

17
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,868
是的 女士 驻扎两次了
Yes, ma'am. Two tours.

18
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,570
你们两个还是一起执行任务吗?
And you're still flying together?

19
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,594
嗯 我们关系很铁 他就像是我的家人一样
Yeah, we all got pretty tight over there. Wouldn't break up the family.

20
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:47,015
- 哥们 我们看起来像家人吗?  - 有点吧
- Dude, do we look like family?  - A little.

21
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,037
那么 在这边执行营救任务
So, what's the biggest difference

22
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,920
和在战场上营救队友最大的区别是什么?
between rescuing over there and what you do here?

23
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:54,498
你不会中弹
Not getting shot at.

24
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:58,260
- 你真幽默  - 当然
- You're a funny guy.  - Yeah. Exactly.

盖恩斯队长
Chief Gaines.

27
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:04,599
我听说你在阿富汗和洛杉矶消防队
I'm told that between Afghanistan and LAFD,

28
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,469
总计有600多次记录在案的营救行动
you have over six hundred documented rescues.

29
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,105
真是... 令人震撼
That's... pretty impressive.

30
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,373
我只是做好份内工作罢了 女士
Just doin' my job, ma'am.

31
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:14,422
命令我去哪 我就去哪
Go where they tell me to go.

32
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:17,892
非常好 你可以停了
That's great. You can cut there.

33
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,820
看到她了
There she is.

34
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:31,392
裂缝很窄啊
Looks pretty tight.

35
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:33,966
把她带上来
Take her up.

36
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:55,925
总部 这是洛杉矶消防局
Metro, this is LAFD.

00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:58,854
我是在V号悬崖处执行营救任务的5号直升机 已看到目标
Helo five on scene of cliff-V rescue. We have visual.

38
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:02,189
- 收到 5号直升机  - 女孩的名字叫什么?
- Copy, Helo five.  - What's the girl's name?

39
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,183
娜塔莉
Natalie.

40
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,161
总部 把她的手机和我们的卫星电话连通
Metro, connect her cell to our sat phone.

41
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,542
5号直升机 你们已经接通
Helo five, you're connected.

42
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:11,866
你好?
Hello?

43

Natalie, this is chief pilot Raymond Gaines of the Los Angeles fire department.

44
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,774
我现在在你上方的直升机里 你还好吗?
I'm piloting the chopper above you. You holdin' up all right?

45
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:21,242
我不知道 我不太舒服
I don't know. I'm not feeling very well.

46
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:25,246
天啊! 车在往下滑
Oh, my God! The car is sliding.

47
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:27,282
娜塔莉 我需要你保持冷静 
Natalie, I'm gonna need you to stay calm, honey.

- We're coming to get you, okay?  - Okay.

49
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:41,967
哥们 我根本看不到下去的路
Man, I don't see a way in.

50
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:45,133
我们得翻下帽子
We're gonna tip the hat.

51
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,938
- 翻下帽子?  - 是啊 你得坐稳了
- Tip the hat?  - Yeah. You might wanna hold on to somethin'.

52
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,261
来吧
Here we go.

53
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,629
还差15英尺
Fifteen feet out.

54
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,898
10英尺
Ten feet.

55
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:02,783
5英尺
Five.

56
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,775
别着急 雷
Easy, Ray.

57
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,578
你成功了
All right. You got it.

58
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:16,612
好了 把她拉上来吧 伙计们
All right. Tuck 'em in, boys.

59
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,713
乔比 不要用篮子了
Joby, forget the basket.

60
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,405
这次就用绳索把她绑在身上救上来
We gotta do a double tie-in on this one.

61
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:26,645
车要是滑下去 她也没救了
That car goes, so does she.

62
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,614
门开了
Door's open.

63
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:35,226
拿上这个
Get this.

64

绳索已挂好
Hookin' up.

65
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,141
准备下滑
On the skid.

66
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:52,370
我们最多只有5分钟
We got five minutes max.

67
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,349
如果上不来怎么办?
What happens in five minutes?

68
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,571
没什么 引擎会失灵
It's no big deal. Just engine failure.

69
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,378
我三分钟就能上来
Good thing I only need three.

70
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,099
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

71
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,951
不 不! 娜塔莉 不要...
No, no! Natalie, do not...

72
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:11,272
天啊! 快救我出去
Oh, my God! Get me out of here.

73
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,049
娜塔莉 我需要你千万别动
Natalie, I need you to stay perfectly still.

74
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:16,425
- 我得把车稳住 好吗?  - 快点 求你了

搞定
Got it.

77
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:43,618
什么情况?
What the hell?

78
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:45,680
该死
Shit.

79
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:49,891
迪兰! 天啊 你还好吗?
Dylan! Oh, my God. Are you all right?

80
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,082
天啊
Jesus.

81
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,105
乔比卡住了!
Joby's pinned!

82
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:55,881
该死的
Goddamn it.

83
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,610
乔比 我马上下去
Joby, I'm comin' down.

84
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,763
哈里森 你来驾驶 马克斯 给我根绳子 给你 
Harrison, you're flyin'. Marcus, rig me a rope. Handin' over.

85
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,828
接管
Takin' over.

86
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,754
- 准备好割绳子  - 收到
- Be ready to cut.  - Roger that.

87
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,798
已经钩好
Hooked up.

88
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,633
已踏出机舱
Out the door.

89
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,569
我下去了
Ray's clear.

90
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:45,413
娜塔莉 不要担心 我会把你救...
Natalie, don't you worry. I'm gonna get you out...

91
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:52,987
直升机坚持不住了
This thing isn't gonna hold!

92
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,291
雷 已经很危险了! 我们要坠毁了!
Ray, we are in the red! We are going to crash!

93
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:58,459
娜塔莉 我们现在就走!
Natalie, we are going now!

94
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,817
我抓住你了
I got you.

95
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,100
- 割!  - 乔比 往外荡!
- Cut it!  - Joby, swing!

96
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:22,817
棒!
Yeah!

97
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:27,867
- 现在把你送回家怎么样?  - 太好了
- What do we say we get you home now?  - I think that's a really good idea.

98

{\an8}加利福尼亚技术中心 加州 帕萨迪纳

99
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,916
日本的仙台大地震
Now the Sendai quake in Japan

100
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:36,164
是自1900年以来五场地震中震级最高的一次
was considered to be one of the five strongest since 1900.

101
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:42,503
这次地震破坏力很强 它把日本岛移动了8英尺
It was so powerful, in fact, that it moved the main island of Japan eight feet.

102
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:47,941
这才只是全球每年130万场
This is just one of the 1.3 million earthquakes

103
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,528
地震中的一次
that occur around the globe each year.

104
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:53,782
北美洲最大的一次地震发生在
The largest ever recorded here in North America:

105
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:58,286
阿拉斯加安克雷奇 1964年 9.1级
Anchorage, Alaska, 1964. A 9.1.

106
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:02,958
地球整整颤抖了五分钟
The earth shook for five straight minutes.

107
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:07,095
地震释放的能量相当于一千万颗
The energy release was the equivalent of ten million atom bombs

108
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:09,827
扔在广岛的核弹爆炸产生的能量
the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.

109
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,983
这还不是有史以来最大的地震
And that's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded.

110
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,445
最大的一场发生在它4年前
No, the biggest was four years earlier

111
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:17,005
在智利南部瓦尔迪维亚海岸
off the coast of Valdivia in Southern Chile.

112
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:21,650
里氏9.5级 就是这里
A 9.5 on the Richter scale. Right there.

113
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:24,345
嘭
Bam.

114
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,986
这次地震持续了十一分钟
This quake lasted eleven minutes

115
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:30,719
并引发了82英尺高的海啸 将一万三千英里外的
and spawned a Tsunami eighty-two feet high that leveled Hilo, Hawaii,

116
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,787
夏威夷的希洛夷为平地
Eight thousand miles away.

117
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:36,729
一万三千公里外
Eight thousand miles away.

118
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:39,676
所以说...
So... it's...

119
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,380
这么严重的破坏
it's mass destruction like this.

120
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,335
证明了我们正在做的调查的重要性
that shows just how important the research that we're doing here is,

121
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:50,378
因为我们需要准确预测这些地震 对吧?
because we need to be able to predict these things. Right?

122
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:52,533
并有所准备 请讲 女士
To plan and prepare for them. Yes, ma'am.

123
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,844
教授 你认为这么严重的灾难会发生在这里吗?
Professor, do you think something that intense could happen here?

124
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:59,981
嗯 圣安德列斯断层从加利福尼亚州正中穿过
Well, the San Andreas fault runs right up the spine of California.

125
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:05,967
它是两个不断移动的板块的分界线
It's the demarcation line between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving.

126
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,423
另外就是每一百五十年
Well, and add to that the fact that it's supposed to happen

127
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,291
会发生一次地震
every one hundred and fifty years

128
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:13,861
而现在距离上次大地震已经大约250年了
and we're about a hundred years overdue.

129
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:17,098
这不是可不可能的事
I'd say it's not a matter of if.

130
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,781
而是何时会地震
It's a matter of when.

131
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:25,939
天啊 大块头 这次你都对她做了什么?
Damn, Godzilla. What the hell did you do to her this time?

132
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,510
跟一辆车玩了拔河游戏 你什么时候可以把它修好?
Played a little tug of war with a car. How soon before you get her fixed?

133
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,248
我去给马第尼斯打个电话 让他送个新的来维修部
I'll call Martinez today. Get a new one sent over to maintenance.

134
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:36,316
尤金 你再走快点 胯骨就要脱臼了
Elgin, you move any faster, you're gonna break that hip.

135
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,121
哈里森说你准备放假 和布雷克出去几天
Harrison said you're taking off with Blake for a few days.

136
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,407
嗯 明天就走 得把她送回学校
Yeah. Leavin' tomorrow. Driving her back up to school.

137
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,324
这周末她们的排球队就要迎来第一场比赛了
Volleyball team has their first game this weekend,

138
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,995
我想我们可以沿着海岸线开一圈 还能野营
so I figured we'd cruise up the coast. Do a little campin'.

139
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,085
哥们 真不敢相信她已经上大学了
Dude, I can't believe she's in college already.

140
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:51,502
是啊
I know.

141
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:54,535
- 光阴似箭啊 里面见  - 行 哥们
- Too fast, brother. I'll catch you inside.  - All right, man.

- 劳伦斯 我得给你看个东西  - 什么?
- Lawrence, I gotta show you something.  - Yeah?

144
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,917
我们在内华达州的法尔可发现了小规模的群震
Now, we got a rare low-level seismic swarm out in Falco, Nevada.

145
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:12,208
在过去的24小时内发生了23次非常小的地震
Twenty-three small quakes, all tiny. 2.0 to 2.6

146
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,184
震级在2.0到2.6之间
in the last twenty-four hours.

147
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,850
内华达州的法尔可在哪?
Where the hell is Falco, Nevada?

148
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,427
拉斯维加斯往南56公里 离胡佛水坝大概8公里
Thirty-five miles southeast of Vegas, maybe five miles from the Hoover Dam.

149
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,225
嗯
Right.

150
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:24,449
- 那里没有断层啊  - 没有已知的断层
- There aren't any faults out there.  - Any known faults.

151
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:28,769
如果我们在地震时赶去 就能测试我们的理论了
Now, if we get there while the mini quakes continue, we can test our theory.

152
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:32,022
如果磁脉冲速率在地震发生之前上升...
And if the magnetic pulse rate goes up before the quakes...

153
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:34,625
- 那我们就能预测它  - 完全正确
- Then we're predicting them.  - Then we are predicting them.

154
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,313
好啊 咱们去看看
All right. Let's go check it out.

155
00:12:57,765 --> 00:12:59,194
- 嗨 爸爸  - 嘿 宝贝
- Hi, Dad.  - Hey, sweetie.

156
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:01,219
我在想有没有地方放我的自行车
I was wondering if there was room for my bike.

157
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,622
这样我就能骑车去上课 也不用买停车卡了
I thought that I could ride it to class and then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.

158
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:08,175
好主意 我肯定会帮你找到地方的
That's a great idea. I'm sure I could figure out a way to fit it in.

159
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:11,015
太棒了 我找不到妈妈房门的钥匙了
All right, great. I can't find the key to the lock at Mom's,

160
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:13,848
它不在我梳妆台上面最左边的抽屉里
so it's either in the top left drawer of my dresser

161
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,217
就在衣柜顶上我的粉色鞋盒里
or on top of the wardrobe in my pink shoe box.

162
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,035
好 没问题 我会找到它的
Okay, no problem. I'll find it.

163
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:21,088
不知道你晚上有什么计划 我想带你出去吃饭
Don't know if you have plans tonight, but I would love to take you to dinner.

164
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:23,536
你也可以把你妈妈邀请来 应该会很开心的
You could even invite your mom along. Could be fun.

165
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,703
谢谢爸爸 不过我们晚上准备和丹尼尔出去
Thanks, Dad. But we already have plans with Daniel.

166
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,432

Dad?

167
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:34,084

170
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:40,800
还有 不要忘待自行车钥匙
Oh, and don't forget the bike key.

171
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,410
不会的 我知道了
I won't. I got it.

172
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,912
- 拜 爸爸 我爱你  - 嗯 我也爱你 甜心
- Bye, Dad. I love you.  - Okay. I love you, too, honey.

This is the third mini quake since we've been here.

178
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,292
每次微震之前电磁脉冲速率都上升了
And the magnetic pulse rate has increased before each one of them.

179
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,402
我们画出图像了 伙计
We got a pattern, my friend.

这次是2.0级 我们的模板可以预测震级
That was a 2.0. Our model's predictive.

181
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,760
我们成功了 哥们! 终于成功了!
We got it right, man! Finally!

182
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,059
是啊 当然

该死
Oh, shit.

184
00:15:53,315 --> 00:15:54,291
怎么回事?
What's wrong?

185
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,912
脉冲速率又突然上升了 读数很大

别担心
Don't worry about it.

248

当然 大家都没去上班 也没在睡觉
Obviously, people weren't at work. They weren't asleep.

252
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:46,894
尽管这样 伤亡仍旧非常...
Even so, we know the devastation was fairly...

253
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:50,197
- 太糟了  - 是啊
- This is bad.  - Yeah.

254
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:51,766
我们什么时候走?
What time we headin' out?

255
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:54,735
下午两点四十 大家都在收拾行装
Fourteen-thirty. Guys are preppin' the gear now.

- All right. Let's get to work.  - Sophisticated rescue operation underway.

257
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,276
所以现在是那个丹尼尔带布雷克去?
So this Daniel guy's taking Blake now?

258
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,900
换了是我 就直接请病假带她去
I would have just called in sick.

259
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,080
所以我能当队长 你不能
It's why I'm the boss and you're not.

260
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,817
我敢肯定没有你 我们照样能正常运转
Pretty sure we can manage a few days without ya.

261
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,850
鞋带开了
Shoe's untied.

262

I want you to know that I respect what you and your dad have.

265
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:40,214
我也知道让你妈妈搬来住 你很难接受
And I know that your mom moving in has to feel like a pretty big step.

266
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:45,135
但我永远不会干涉你对你爸爸的感情 也不会取代他
But I'm never gonna try to change what you have with him or take his place.

267
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:46,653
好吗?
Okay?

268
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:50,157
嗯 那就好
Yeah. Okay, cool.

269
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,362
你为什么没有孩子?
Hey, how come you never had kids?

270
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:57,531
我有啊
Oh, I did.

271
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:59,533
这就是其中之一
This is one of them right here.

272
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,684
她为旧金山的天空又增添了一份美 不是吗?
She's a pretty nice addition to the San Francisco skyline, don't you think?

273
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:05,294
- "大门"  - 很容易记住 是吗?
- "The gate".  - Catchy, right?

274
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,476
嗯 我喜欢它
Yeah, I like it.

275
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:11,545
妈妈跟我说 这是城市中最高的建筑物 对吧?
Mom was telling me about this. She said it's the tallest building in the city, right?

276
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,699
当它竣工之后 它将会是最高最坚固的建筑
When it's finished, it'll be the tallest, strongest

277
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,951
而且已经卖出去80%了
and it's already 80% sold.

278
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:19,639
但说实话...
But, honestly...

279
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:20,835
我想我没孩子
I guess I never had any kids

280
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:24,123
是因为建这些东西就耗费了我好长时间
'cause I was always so busy raising these.

281
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,870
{\an8}奥克兰机场

282
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:33,200
妈妈发短信了 她今天会和你妹妹一起吃饭
Mom texted. She's having lunch with your sister today.

283
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,570
嗯 她只会在城里待几天 而且非常想见你妈妈
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days and really wanted to meet her.

284
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,372
我有些紧张 苏珊有些溺爱孩子
I'm a little nervous though. Susan can be kind of overprotective.

285
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:42,843
谢谢
Thank you.

286
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:53,843
{\an8}旧金山

287
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:24,118
- 乔纳森  - 早上好 里迪克先生
- Jonathan.  - Good morning, Mr. Riddick.

288
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:26,464
早上好 你一个人没事吧 布雷克?
Morning. You gonna be okay, Blake?

289
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,588
嗯 没事的
Yeah, I'll be fine.

290
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,480
- 你好  - 你好
- Hi.  - Hello.

291
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,483
对不起 劳伦斯 你需要什么吗?
I'm sorry, Lawrence. Can I get you anything?

292
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,585
不用 我没事 亚力克西 谢谢
No. I'm fine, Alexi. Thank you.

293
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:01,235
你真的想待在这里吗?
Are you sure you want to be here?

294
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:03,513
其实我只是想转移一下注意力
I can use the distraction, actually.

295
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:04,960
怎么了?
Yeah?

296
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,749
外面有一个记者
There's a reporter outside.

297
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:10,363
她说她在写一篇关于在内华达州地震的报道
Says she's doing a segment on what happened in Nevada.

298
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:15,102
我去和她说现在不太方便
I'm gonna tell her that it's not a good time.

299
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:19,639
不要 等等 金为了这个把命都丢了
No, wait a minute. Kim gave his life for this.

300
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:22,883
人们需要知道我们已经可以预测地震了
People need to know that we can predict these things now.

301
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,551
你想要吗? 我仓库里有好几千本
You want a copy? I got about a thousand in storage.

302
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:34,487
只有地震了才会有人来找我们
No one listens to us until the ground shakes, I guess.

303
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:36,947
我听说你同事的事了
You know, they told me what happened to your colleague.

304
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,458
我们不需要现在做采访的
We don't have to do this now.

305
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:42,663
- 我们需要  - 好了
- Yeah, we do.  - We're good to go.

306
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:44,809
- 好的  - 好的
- Okay.  - Okay.

307
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,433
录制开始
Rolling.

308
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:47,832
我的第一个问题是
First question.

309
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,920
为什么没有人预料到内华达州会有地震?
How come no one saw what happened in Nevada coming?

310
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,573
因为我们以前不知道那里有断层
Because we didn't know there were any fault lines out there.

311
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:55,500
为什么?
Why not?

312
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,396
和普遍看法相反的是 科学家不是无所不知的
Contrary to popular belief, scientists don't know everything.

313
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,546
你曾经公开声明...
I understand that you publicly stated that...

314
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:04,885
科学家总有一天会成功预测地震的
someday, scientists will be able to predict earthquakes.

315
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:06,312
其实经过昨天的事情
Actually as of yesterday,

316
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:08,672
我们相信现在已经可以预测它们了
we now believe that we can predict them.

317
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:10,391
教授!
Professor!

318
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,930
- 我能和你几句话吗?  - 好的 不好意思
- Talk to you a sec?  - Yeah. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

319
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,665
怎么了?
What is it?

320
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:21,639
这是我们监测站记录的在圣安地列斯断层上的
Current pulse rates at our monitoring stations.

321
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,502
电流脉冲速率
All along the San Andreas fault.

322
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:24,905
平均值都在82到85之间
Their averages are spiking from 82 to 85,

323
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,277
最大的跃升在旧金山
with the biggest jumps coming from San Francisco.

324
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,744
比在内华达州的时候监测到的数据高出二十多
More than twenty points higher than what we saw in Nevada.

325
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:31,143
不 不 不 不可能
No, no, no. There's no way.

326
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:32,679
我们检查过好几遍了
We checked. We double-checked.

327
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,218
我们还把所有的设备全部重置又重新查了一遍
Then we reset all the instruments and triple-checked.

328
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,316
这些数据都是对的
Those are the counts.

329
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,787
等等 等等 等等...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute...

330
00:26:42,322 --> 00:26:44,161
好的
Okay.

331
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,301
如果...
If...

332
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:50,869
如果我们
If we draw a line

333
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:54,668
从圣安地列斯的底部到胡佛大坝画一条线
from the bottom of the San Andreas up to the Hoover Dam,

334
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:58,005
它和科罗拉多河几乎重合
it almost literally follows the Colorado River,

335
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,308
河道是一个自然形变
which is a natural deformation event.

336
00:27:01,408 --> 00:27:03,324
地质学上...
And geologically...

337
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:07,402
形变标志了边界
deformation events mark boundaries.

338
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:10,784
它们标志了边界
They mark boundaries.

339
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:13,389
那么 有没有可能?...
So, what if?...

340
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:17,072
有没有可能...
What if this...

341
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:20,310
这一大块陆地和我们的板块是相连的?
whole chunk of land is connected to our tectonic plate?

342
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,848
也就是说昨天在内华达州发生的事情不是异常
That would tell us that what happened yesterday in Nevada was not an anomaly.

343
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,704
好 它有没有可能只是从洛杉矶到旧金山
No, what if it was a precursor movement

344
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:35,031
这一条板块交界的断层运动的
along the leading edge of the plate boundary fault from Los Angeles

345
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,244
一个序曲?
all the way up to San Francisco?

346
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,740
你是说整个圣安地列斯断层都会分开?
Are you saying you think the whole San Andreas fault might go off?

347
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,183
是的 就是这个意思
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

348
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:46,522
我们要和谁说?
Who should we call?

349
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,390
所有人
Everybody.

350
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,657
- 卧槽  - 哦 我有餐巾纸 给你
- Oh, bloody hell. - Oh! I have something. Here.

351
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:03,437
- 我真是个白痴  - 不
- I'm a complete idiot.  - No.

352
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:07,773
- 谢谢 你人真好  - 没事的
- Thank you very much. It's very kind.  - Yeah, no problem.

353
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,646
- 我叫布雷克  - 哦 对 我叫布雷克
- I'm Blake, by the way.  - Oh, yeah. I'm Blake.

354
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:16,495
我不叫布雷克! 我叫本 我叫本·泰勒
I'm not Blake! I'm Ben. Ben Taylor is my name.

355
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,518
- 很高兴遇到你  - 很高兴遇到你
- Pleased to meet you.  - It's nice to meet you.

356
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:20,787
刚刚和你一起走进来的是你爸爸?
So was that your father you came in with?

357
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:22,089
丹尼尔·里迪克?
Daniel Riddick?

358
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:25,424
他是我妈妈的男朋友
He's my mom's boyfriend.

359
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:27,407
你要和他见面吗?
Are you meeting with him?

360
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:30,796
哦 不是 我... 完全不是
Oh, no. I... not even close.

361
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:36,403
要是真那样就好了 我是来面试的 里迪克先生是
I wish. I'm interviewing for a job here and Mr. Riddick is the boss of the boss

362
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:40,123
我老板的老板的老板
of the boss that I'd be working for.

363
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:42,759
你... 是来面试什么工作的?
So... what kind of job are you interviewing for?

364
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:45,380
任何和工程或者设计有关的工作都行 我不是骄傲
Anything in engineering or design. I'm not picky or proud.

365
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,114
我只是... 我想在这里工作
I just... I just want to work here.

366
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:51,635
如果你是建筑师的话 这地方... 太好了
If you're an architect, this is the... place to be.

367
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:56,540
你好 我是奥利 他是我的哥哥
Hi. I'm Ollie. He's my brother.

368
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,859
你好 遇到你很高兴 奥利 我叫布雷克
Hi. It's nice to meet you, Ollie. I'm Blake.

369
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,402
你真漂亮
You know, you're quite beautiful.

370
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:05,965
- 谢谢  - 奥利 你... 不好意思
- Why, thank you.  - Ollie. Do you... Sorry.

371
00:29:06,065 --> 00:29:08,262
你还记得... 我们那天谈过的事情吗?
Do you remember... do you remember what we discussed?

372
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:11,985
坐着别说话 很少有人会带弟弟来面试的
Sit still and no talking. It's not normal to bring little brothers to job interviews.

373
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,174
别让我难堪 行吗?
And let's not embarrass me, okay?

374
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,596
我能不能帮他要一下你的电话号码?
Do you mind if I get your phone number for him?

375
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:21,121
奥利! 这...
Ollie! It's exactly...

376
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:23,687
怎么了? 你反正开不了这个口
What? You'll never ask for it.

377
00:29:23,787 --> 00:29:27,210
然后我就得听你说你后悔没开口了
And then I'll have to listen to how much you regretted not getting it.

378
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,532
- 我...  - 泰勒先生?
- I...  - Mr. Taylor?

379
00:29:29,632 --> 00:29:32,826
- 卡特女士可以见你了  - 谢谢
- Ms. Carter will see you now.  - Thank you.

380
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:35,996
我...
I...

381
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:38,831
祝你好运
Good luck.

382
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:43,303
谢谢 还有你 坐好了 什么话都别说
Thank you. And you, sit here. And don't say another word.

383
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,775
- 你好 我是本  - 你好 
- Hi. I'm Ben.  - Hello.

384
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,778
- 我们现在就过去  - 太好了
- We're gonna head straight over.  - Excellent.

385
00:29:53,389 --> 00:29:55,590
你想聊什么?
What do you want to talk about?

386
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,569
- 你是哪里人?  - 英国人
- Where you from?  - England.

387
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:01,885
我们的爸妈出去坐游轮玩儿了
Ben thought that while our parents were going to be on a cruise,

388
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:04,053
本觉得我们两个等他面试完了
he and I should take a holiday here in the city,

389
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:05,917
- 可以在城里到处转转  - 太棒了
- after his interview.  - Awesome.

390
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:10,046
你想听听我们的行程安排吗?
Would you like to hear our itinerary?

391
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:13,617
洛杉矶

392
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,211
苏珊
Susan.

393
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:28,715
- 真高兴终于见到你了  - 我也是
- It's nice to finally meet you.  - You as well.

394
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,560
丹尼尔请你和他同居了
Now that Daniel's asked you to move in with him,

395
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:33,019
看来你们两个的关系已经蛮认真了吧
things must be pretty serious.

396

00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:49,818

405
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,473

406
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,946
你还有一个孩子意外溺死了?
Your other one drowned in an accident?

407
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:03,182
是的 你也真直白
Yes, to put it bluntly.

408
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:07,757
- 我不是那个意思  - 你能等我一下吗?
- I didn't mean it like that.  - Can you just give me one minute?

409

411
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:18,198
我现在去做出发前的检修...
Oh, I'm on my way to maintenance before we head out, and...

412
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:20,919
我打扰你了吗?
Am I interrupting anything?

413
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,372
没什么重要的事 怎么了?
Nothing important. What's going on?

414

415
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,441
我就是想为了昨天的事情和你道个歉
I wanted to tell you I was sorry for how I acted yesterday.

416
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:30,076
- 不用 雷 真的...  - 不 艾玛...
- No, Ray, really...  - No, Emma...

417
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,829
我只是对你和布雷克搬去和别的男人住
I just wasn't ready to hear about you and Blake

418
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,713
没什么心理准备
moving in with someone else.

419
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:37,664
我本该早点告诉你的
I should've told you before.

420
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,018
嘿 布雷克有什么想法?
Hey, how's Blake feel about it?

421
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:41,698
她希望我们能重组这个家庭
You know, she'd like us to be a family again.

422
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,858
我觉得她可能会...
I think it's gonna be hard for her to...

423
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:55,883
- 艾玛 艾玛  - 天啊
- Emma. Emma.  - Oh, my God.

424
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,862
这里地震了
We're having an earthquake.

425
00:31:58,774 --> 00:32:01,107
天啊 雷 我得赶紧逃出去
Oh, Jesus, Ray. I gotta get out of here.

426
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:03,136
你在哪里?
Where are you?

427
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:06,568
- 我在泰特维斯顿餐馆  - 靠 你在顶楼
- The Tate Weston.  - Shit. You're on the top floor.

428
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:08,915
艾玛 听着 你让大家都跑到屋顶上去
Emma, listen, get as many people as you can and get to the roof.

429
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:10,984
我在直升机上 我会去那里接你的 好吗?
I'm in the Helo and I'll get you from there, okay?

430
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:11,785

431
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:13,187

432
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:22,596
不 不 不 不 不 躲到桌子下面去
No, no, no, no, no, no. No. Under the table.

433
00:32:22,696 --> 00:32:24,464
找个有覆盖物的地方 抓牢了!
Drop, cover and hold on!

434
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:32,805
劳伦斯 里氏地震等级已经从6.5跳到8.5了
Lawrence, the Richter just jumped from 6.5 to an 8.5.

435
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:35,241
- 这是什么意思?  - 十的指数!
- Well, what does that mean?  - Powers of ten!

436
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:37,729
也就是说它现在已经比刚刚强了一百倍了!
So it's a hundred times stronger now!

437
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:40,772
别急 加州理工学院应该是最安全的地方了
Don't worry. Caltech is probably the safest place to be right now.

438
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:45,052
教授! 好像整个圣安地列斯断层都被激活了
Professor! It looks like the whole San Andreas fault line is being activated.

439
00:32:45,852 --> 00:32:48,388
地震往旧金山去了
And it's heading towards San Francisco.

440
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:51,570
好了 都搞定了
All right. All done.

441
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,327

Do you mind if I borrow your book for a second?

446
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,683
和本说我会为他说几句好话的

Shit. Her cell service just went out.

533
00:45:40,264 --> 00:45:43,679
现在不可能有搜救人员去挖地下车库的
There's no way rescue personnel are gonna be diggin' in garages any time soon.

534
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,249
地面上人太多了
Too many populated places above ground.

535
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:50,137
我... 我们现在怎么办?
What... what are we gonna do?

536
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:56,075
我们去救我们的女儿
We're going to get our daughter.

537
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:25,037
布雷克! 布雷克!

00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:30,209
布雷克! 布雷克 我是本 你还好吗?
Blake! Blake, it's Ben. Are you okay?

540
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:33,712
我出不去 车顶塌下来了 我的腿卡住了
I can't get out. The roof's collapsing. My legs are trapped.

541
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,714
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.

542
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:39,375
奥利 我们得把这根杆子抬起来
Ollie, we need to lift this beam

543
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:40,569
减轻她腿上的压力
to get the pressure off her legs.

544
00:46:40,669 --> 00:46:42,671
- 好吗?  - 好的
- Okay?  - Yeah.

545
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:45,709
我们来试试看 准备好了吗?

548
00:46:53,532 --> 00:46:55,429
我已经尽全力了!
I am!

549
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:57,194
有用!
It's working!

550
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,118
奥利!
Ollie!

551
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:17,290
本? 奥利?
Ben? Ollie?

552
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,059
我们还在 我们还在
We're still here. We're still here.

553
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:28,401
不 不
Oh, no. No.

554
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:32,855
你们得赶紧出去 这大楼马上就要塌了
You guys have to get out of here. This building's gonna collapse.

555
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:35,534
不
No.

556
00:47:38,043 --> 00:47:40,866
我们不可能把你一个人留在这里的
There's not a chance in hell we're leaving you in there.

557
00:47:49,237 --> 00:47:51,074
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.

558
00:47:53,826 --> 00:47:55,609
好的
All right.

559
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,839
就这样
Here we go.

560
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,254
太聪明了 有效果了
Brilliant. It's working.

561
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:19,517
- 抬不高了  - 我还被卡着呢!
- It won't go any higher. - I'm still stuck!

562
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:38,002
- 奥利...  - 她能动了!
- Ollie...  - She's moving!

563
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:42,444
快点 快点 快点! 
Hurry, hurry. Hurry!

564
00:48:52,217 --> 00:48:54,186
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

565
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,516
还好
Yeah.

566
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:02,128
- 你确定?  - 是
- Are you sure?  - Yeah.

567
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:07,132
- 谢谢你 谢谢  - 没关系
- Thank you. Thank you, guys.  - Pleasure.

568
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:09,066
干得好
Good job.

569
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:13,806
又来了一波余震 我们得抓紧离开这儿
Come on. It's another aftershock. We've got to get out of here.

570
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:20,245
小心! 快点! 过来!
Look out! Hurry! Come on!

571
00:49:20,345 --> 00:49:22,147
我们得躲开这些高楼
We have to get away from these buildings.

572
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:24,963
- 布雷克! 布雷克!  - 天啊
- Blake! Blake!  - Oh, my God.

573
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,328
这边! 这边!
This way! This way!

574
00:49:30,722 --> 00:49:33,416
- 天啊! 奥利!  - 天啊!
- Jesus! Ollie!  - Oh, my God!

575
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:34,860
布雷克!
Blake!

576
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:43,102
- 过来!  - 走! 走! 走!
- Come on!  - Go! Go! Go!

577
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:54,280
真不敢相信 丹尼尔竟然溜了
I cannot believe that Daniel just took off.

578
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,081
真是混蛋
What an asshole.

579
00:49:57,058 --> 00:49:58,722
请大家让路...
Step aside, people...

580
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:04,428
我得联系父母 让他们知道我安全了
I gotta get ahold of my parents. I gotta let them know I'm okay.

581
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:06,959
这里没信号 我试过了
Cellphones aren't working. I've tried.

582
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:10,329
我们得找一家电器店
We need to find an electronics store.

583
00:50:11,805 --> 00:50:14,367
你那本书上有记录吗?
Does that book of yours list businesses?

584
00:50:15,493 --> 00:50:17,994
我书里什么都有
My book has everything.

585
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,575
好消息 我们大部分应急系统仍在工作
The good news is most of our emergency systems are still working.

586
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:25,944
有17个监控器发来了信号
We've got signals coming in from seventeen monitors.

587
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:30,860
刚刚是里氏9.1级
We just experienced a 9.1.

588
00:50:34,252 --> 00:50:36,755
劳伦斯... 你得看看这个
Lawrence... you need to see this.

589
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:39,742
还有什么发现吗?
What do we got?

590
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:43,729
这是地震前的震波曲线
Here are the pulse rates before the quake.

591
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,733
- 嗯 好的  - 这是现在的震波曲线
- Yeah, okay.  - And here are the pulse rates now.

592
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:53,442
一样 甚至数值更大 地震还没有减弱
The same. Or higher. So the earthquake didn't diminish them.

593
00:50:53,742 --> 00:50:55,774
天啊
Oh, man.

594
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,211
这下糟了
Oh, this is not good.

595
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:02,355
亚力克西 把断层那儿还在工作的监控台
Alexi, I want all the data from every monitoring station

596
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:04,680
能收集到的所有数据立刻传给我
still up along the fault line and get it for me now.

597
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,309
- 好的  - 怎么了?
- Right.  - What's going on?

598
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:08,776
- 地震还没有结束  - 该死
- This is not over.  - Shit.

599
00:51:09,376 --> 00:51:11,990
该死 这东西不能用了
Oh, man. This thing's fried.

600
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:16,260
- 过来 所有人集合  - 要做什么?
- Come on. I need everybody.  - What are we doing?

601
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,497
让你出镜 我们必须警告公众
Gettin' you on the air. We need to warn people.

602
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,363
怎么做? 信号上传不了的
How? There's no way to upload a signal.

603
00:51:20,364 --> 00:51:22,004
你可是在加州理工哦
You're at Caltech.

604
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,600
多媒体实验室

605
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,880
谁想在独立研究课上拿A?
Okay, who wants an A in independent study?

606
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,664
我开了一门新课 "如何用黑进媒体来拯救生命"
I'm startin' a new class, "How to save lives by hacking media outlets".

607
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,374
当然 我加入
Hell, yeah, man. I'm in.

608
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:45,127
太棒了 兄弟 带上你的笔记本 开始吧
Sweet, bro. Get your laptop. Let's go.

609
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:48,861
就在这儿 行动
Right here. Move.

610
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:51,263
我们来了 抬他起来
Here we go. Up. Lift.

611
00:51:53,332 --> 00:51:55,633
应该就是前面了
It should be just up ahead.

612
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:58,704
就是这家 
There it is.

613
00:52:08,313 --> 00:52:10,411
现在所有用电的东西都不能用了
Okay, anything running on electricity isn't gonna work,

614
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:11,910
所以我们得找...
so we have to find...

615
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,286
转轮电话或按钮电话
a rotary or a push button phone.

616
00:52:14,386 --> 00:52:16,088
你怎么知道这些的?
How do you know all this?

617
00:52:16,188 --> 00:52:20,483
我爸爸 他在洛杉矶消防救援队工作
My dad. He works for L.A. Fire and Rescue.

618
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:25,088
在这儿
Over here.

619
00:52:26,264 --> 00:52:28,834
太棒了 我来找电话线
Great. I'll look for a landline.

620
00:52:43,198 --> 00:52:44,132
找到一个!
I got one!

621
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:53,191
- 布雷克?  - 爸爸
- Blake?  - Dad.

622
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,277
爸爸 我逃出来了 我安全了
Dad. I got out. I'm okay.

623
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,097
她安全了
She's okay.

624
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:01,473
让我和她说
Let me talk to her.

625
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:03,850

Mom?

627
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:06,799
亲爱的 感谢上帝
Thank God, honey.

628
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,074
丹尼尔还好吗?
Is Daniel okay?

629
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:14,613
- 他丢下我了 妈妈  - 他什么?
- He left me, Mom.  - He what?

630
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:19,134
他跟一个警卫说了我在哪儿 然后自己溜了...
He told a security guard where I was and then he just took off and...

631
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:22,787
这两兄弟偶然听到了 才救我出来的
these two brothers that I met overheard him and they came to help me.

632
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:26,325
- 我现在和他们在一起  - 他扔下你了?
- I'm with them right now.  - He left her?

633
00:53:26,425 --> 00:53:28,293
我们这就来接你 你在哪?
We're comin' to get you, honey. Where are you?

634
00:53:28,493 --> 00:53:32,880
在唐人街的一家电器店里
I'm in an electronics store in Chinatown.

635
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,300
亲爱的 你没事儿了 但是你现在要听我的
Honey, it's gonna be okay, but I need you to listen to me.

636
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,910
现在如果出城的话 会遇到大堵车
Getting out of there is gonna be a complete gridlock nightmare,

637
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,096
所以找个高地 那里更安全
so get to higher ground, it's safer.

638
00:53:40,196 --> 00:53:42,364
- 我们才能看到你  - 好的
- That's where I'm gonna be able to see you.  - Okay.

639
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:45,090
你还记得我们是在哪儿庆祝梅罗丽生日的吗?
Do you remember where we spent Mallory's birthday weekend?

640
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:45,878
科伊特塔?
At Coit Tower?

641
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:49,192
记得 山上那个喷嘴一样的水泥楼
Yeah. That tall cement nozzle thing on the hill.

642
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,527
是的 中途别停 去那里 我们就在那里见面
Exactly. Don't stop anywhere. Go there. That's where we'll meet.

643
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:56,021
坚强点 亲爱的 我们过去接你
Stay strong, honey. We're comin' to get you.

644
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:57,384

649
00:54:25,947 --> 00:54:27,611
你把我女儿扔下了?
You left my daughter?

650
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,737
如果你还没死的话 我他妈一定会杀了你
If you're not already dead, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

651
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,598
好样的
Thatta girl.

652
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,983
好 我们必须走了
All right, we need to get going.

653
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:42,798
你爸爸要怎么接我们
So how is your dad going to pick us up?

654
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,670
他正开直升机过来
He's on his way in a helicopter.

655
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,271
太赞了
That's so cool.

656
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:49,943
我需要你在帮我找科伊特塔
I need you to look up Coit Tower on your map.

657
00:54:54,278 --> 00:54:57,015
该你了 你父母肯定也很担心你
It's your turn. Your parents will be worried sick.

658
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,937
谢谢你
Thank you.

659
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:08,536
不要离开街道
Stay on the street.

660
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:14,032
我们去哪里?
Where are we going?

661
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:38,390
给我滚开!
Get out of my way!

662
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:43,561
嘿! 这是我的位置...
Hey! That was my spot...

663
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:06,418
要知道 自从梅罗丽离开我们后...
You know, when you were talking to Blake...

664
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:09,752
一直到刚才你和布雷克讲话
that was the first time I heard you

665
00:56:09,753 --> 00:56:11,815
我是第一次听你提到梅罗丽
say Mallory's name since we lost her.

666
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:17,836
你知道布雷克一直保存着
Hey, do you know that Blake keeps pictures

667
00:56:17,837 --> 00:56:19,431
我们去旧金山玩的照片吗?
from our San Francisco trip?

668
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,183
当然 在她的回忆盒子里
Yeah, in her memory box.

669
00:56:25,036 --> 00:56:28,707
真是讽刺 现在我们又要去那儿了
It's ironic. Us heading back up there.

670
00:56:29,707 --> 00:56:31,797
那次旅行很好玩
It was a fun trip.

671
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:43,604
我们到哪儿了?
Where are we?

672
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:46,358
贝克尔斯菲 呃 的遗址
Bakersfield. Or what's left of it.

673
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:49,901
我们距离旧金山还有90分钟路
We're just about ninety minutes from San Francisco.

674
00:56:59,671 --> 00:57:00,726
雷?
Ray?

675
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,581
你把引擎关掉了?
Did you just turn off the engine?

676
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:10,908
对 变速箱出故障了
Yeah, we got a gearbox failure.

677
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:12,817
一定是在洛杉矶的时候受损了
Must've been that hit we took in L.A.

678
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:14,119
我们要做自转式下降了
I'm gonna have to autorotate down.

679
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,322
自... 什么?
Auto... what?

680
00:57:17,222 --> 00:57:19,066
我们要坠机了
We're gonna crash.

681
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,560
- 好吧  - 抓紧了
- Right. Okay.  - Hold on.

682
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,579
开始了
Here we go.

683
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,445
抓紧!
Hold on!

684
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:46,119
天啊!
Oh, my God!

685
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:50,522
快了快了 我们就在这儿迫降
Almost there. Almost there. We're just gonna set it down right here.

686
00:58:10,825 --> 00:58:13,128
漏油了 我们得离开这儿
We got fuel all over us. We need to get out of here.

687
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:30,028
过来 我们得抓紧走 弯下腰走
Come on. We gotta go. Stay low. Stay low.

688
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:39,187
没事的 只要接着走就好 接着走
It's okay. We just gotta keep movin'. Just gotta keep movin'.

689
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:59,157
跟我来 快点 快点
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

690
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:03,335
进去 进去 进去
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

691
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:06,629
看样子这车是偷来的
Looks like it's been stolen.

692
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:08,600
好吧 我们再偷一次
All right. Well, we'll steal it again.

693
00:59:16,073 --> 00:59:17,404
雷
Ray.

694
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:19,758
别动
Easy.

695
00:59:23,215 --> 00:59:25,275
我需要这辆车
I'll be needin' that truck.

696
00:59:26,884 --> 00:59:28,648
今天不行
Not today.

697
00:59:28,953 --> 00:59:30,522
天啊
Oh, my God.

698
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:47,840
震源在洛杉矶城区以东20英里处
The quake centered about twenty miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

699
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,576
信号塔被毁了 大部分城市电力供应也停了
Cell towers are down. Most of the city's electricity, down.

700
00:59:51,676 --> 00:59:54,279
与外界的通信也中断了
Communication at a virtual standstill.

701
00:59:54,379 --> 00:59:58,015
南加利福尼亚几乎已经变成一堆废墟
The devastation to Southern California is expected to be massive.

702
00:59:58,115 --> 01:00:00,618
实际上 整个加州都受到了冲击
In fact, the entire state will take a hit.

703
01:00:00,718 --> 01:00:02,378
我们收到的报告...
We're already getting reports of...

704
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:04,391
- 我们进去了  - 太棒了
- We're in.  - Yes.

705
01:00:04,491 --> 01:00:07,492
旧金山和其湾区周边
San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area.

706
01:00:07,592 --> 01:00:09,658
经受了至少五波余震...
There have been at least five aftershocks...

707
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:11,429
好的 我们开始吧
Okay. Here we go.

708
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:15,267
制作人将连线洛杉矶 做第一次震后直播
Producers are telling us we have our first live feed from Los Angeles.

709
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:19,404
有请正在加州理工地震研究中心的赛琳娜·强森
Serena Johnson is on the ground at the seismology center at Caltech.

710
01:00:19,504 --> 01:00:22,174
你好 克里斯 我正和加州理工地震研究中心的
Hello, Chris. I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes,

711
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:24,842
执行董事劳伦斯·黑斯教授在一起
executive director for earthquake studies at Caltech.

712
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:27,645
他和他的研究助手金·帕克博士
He and his research partner, Dr. Kim Park,

713
01:00:27,745 --> 01:00:30,082
提出了一个可以预测地震的模型
have come up with a model that predicts earthquakes.

714
01:00:30,182 --> 01:00:32,684
他们知道洛杉矶将遇到地震
They knew L.A. was going to get hit.

715
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:36,048
但当时没有人听他们的 现在是时候听了
But nobody listened to them. It's time now to listen.

716
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:37,628
- 博士 您请讲  - 好的
- Go ahead, doctor.  - Okay.

717
01:00:37,728 --> 01:00:42,960
在地震学术语里 我们刚刚遇到的是一个震群
In seismology terms, what we're experiencing is what we call a swarm event.

718
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,064
简单说 加州的整个地壳构造正在移动
Basically, California's entire tectonic plate has shifted.

719
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:48,664
是的 看上去我们在洛杉矶遇到的地震很强烈
Yes, it seems the quake we experienced here in Los Angeles

720
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:50,868
一直到旧金山 都造成了很大损失
did major damage all the way up in San Francisco.

721
01:00:50,968 --> 01:00:52,492
是的 但是他们经历的地震
Yeah, but the earthquake that they felt

722
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:54,272
是由中央峡谷的断层移动造成的
was from movement along the fault line

723
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:57,809
这个断层移动现在还没有停止
in the central valley. Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

724
01:00:58,209 --> 01:01:01,713
更重要的是 人们需要知道地震还没有结束
More importantly, people need to know that the shaking is not over.

725
01:01:01,813 --> 01:01:05,750
我不是在说余震 旧金山还会被地震袭击的
And it's not aftershocks I'm talking about. San Francisco will get hit again.

726
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,886
这一次会更严重
And it's going to be a bigger monster this time.

727
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:10,888
依据我们的模型估测 应当在里氏9.5级或以上
Our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater.

728
01:01:10,988 --> 01:01:15,527
这次地震会很强烈 甚至加州这里的地震
It will be so big that even though it's happening here in California

729
01:01:16,735 --> 01:01:19,654
在东海岸一样能被感受到
you will feel it on the east coast.

730
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,269
现在 我必须对旧金山的人们再强调一遍
Now, I cannot emphasize this enough to the people of San Francisco:

731
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:28,973
你们需要立刻逃离
You need to get out. And I mean now.

732
01:01:29,473 --> 01:01:32,465
如果做不到 你需要离开任何有遮挡的地方
And if you can't, you need to find any means possible

733
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:35,762
并抓紧可依赖的东西
to drop cover and hold on.

734
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:38,791
因为这将是你最后的救命稻草了
Because your life is gonna depend on it.

735
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:42,988
愿上帝与你同在
God be with you.

736
01:01:49,327 --> 01:01:51,797
余震仍然在冲击着洛杉矶地区...
Aftershocks continue to rock the Los Angeles area...

737
01:01:51,897 --> 01:01:53,857
你是否想过 如果梅罗丽还活着
You ever think about what our life would be like

738
01:01:53,858 --> 01:01:55,538
我们的生活现在会怎样?
if we hadn't lost Mallory?

739
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:01,806
- 呃 没有  - 我想过 一直在想
- Em, don't.  - I do. All the time.

740
01:02:02,006 --> 01:02:05,009
- 我们想前看了  - 不 我们没有
- We've moved on.  - No, we didn't move on.

741
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:08,914
- 我们停了下来  - 你没有亲眼看着她死去
- We stopped moving.  - You didn't lose her on your watch.

742
01:02:09,014 --> 01:02:12,016
- 但是我失去她了  - 我们能不能别说这个?
- No. But I lost her.  - Can we not talk about this?

743
01:02:12,116 --> 01:02:13,777
这是你欠我的
You owe it to me.

744
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:16,219
这... 自从她去世 这是你提到她
This... this is the most I've gotten out of you

745
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,322
话最多的一次了
since she died.

746
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,817
我必须知道 雷
I need to know, Ray.

747
01:02:21,494 --> 01:02:23,961
是我的错吗? 我做错什么了?
Was it me? What did I do?

748
01:02:24,852 --> 01:02:27,133
- 因为我从没有怪罪过你  - 我不想说这个
- Because I never blamed you.  - I don't wanna talk about it.

749
01:02:27,233 --> 01:02:30,828
这不重要 她走了 现在你也走了
It doesn't matter. She's gone. Now you're gone.

750
01:02:32,904 --> 01:02:34,906
还说这些干嘛?
What's the point?

751
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:38,876
我觉得...
I guess the point is...

752
01:02:38,976 --> 01:02:42,166
这就是我为什么离开你
this is why I didn't stick around.

753
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:51,656
小心! 快停车!
Look out! Watch out! You have to stop!

754
01:02:54,693 --> 01:02:55,718
雷!
Ray!

755
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:27,204
这是什么?
What is this?

756
01:03:31,295 --> 01:03:33,809
圣安地列斯断层
The San Andreas fault.

757
01:03:45,537 --> 01:03:47,812
我早就和你讲了 我们该走另一条路
I told you we should've gone the other way.

758
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:50,647
因为你知道会地震?
Because you knew this was gonna happen?

759
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:52,402
你...
You...

760
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:59,710
- 我们欠你一个谢谢  - 是的
- We owe you guys a huge thanks.  - Really.

761
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:03,160
不必 我们差点也犯了同样的错 不过...
No need. We nearly made the same mistake ourselves, but...

762
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,697
开车下来的时候 车轴坏了
busted an axle when we ran off the road.

763
01:04:05,797 --> 01:04:08,575
感谢上帝 我的眼睛比他的好使
Thank goodness my eyes are better than his.

764
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,252
你们知道这附近还有路可走吗?
Do you know if there's any way around this?

765
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:13,532
呃...
Well...

766
01:04:13,832 --> 01:04:16,524
198号公路也许还能走 可以穿过去
the one-ninety-eight might now be out. Through the path.

767
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:17,942
那有多远?
How far is that?

768
01:04:18,342 --> 01:04:21,879
你们得往回走大概... 70英里吧
Ya gotta backtrack, maybe... seventy miles or so.

769
01:04:31,155 --> 01:04:33,925
先生 如果你不介意我问的话...
Sir, if you don't mind me askin'...

770
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:35,793
你这帽子是哪里来的?
Where'd you get your hat?

771
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,793
伯基航空

772
01:04:37,193 --> 01:04:38,485
你们真是帮了我一个大忙
You guys really bailed us out.

773
01:04:38,486 --> 01:04:40,248
你确定不用我带你们飞一程吗?
You sure we can't fly you anywhere?

774
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:43,568
不用 我们儿子住在大山里 没地方降落
Yeah. Our son lives in the mountains. There's no place to land.

775
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:47,422
- 谢谢你们的车  - 当然 一路顺风
- Thanks for the wheels.  - You bet. Be safe.

776
01:04:47,822 --> 01:04:49,473
拜拜
Bye.

777
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:05,457
再过几分钟 油就能加满了
We should be fueled up in a couple of minutes.

778
01:05:05,557 --> 01:05:07,324
好的 太棒了
Okay, great.

779
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,622
你还好吗?
Everything okay?

780
01:05:19,628 --> 01:05:22,507
你之前问我 是不是你的错
You asked me before if it was you.

781
01:05:23,207 --> 01:05:25,009
不是
It wasn't.

782
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:31,665
我知道你从来不责怪我 我...
I knew you didn't blame me. I...

783
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:36,003
我不知道该如何面对梅罗丽的死
I just didn't know how to deal with Mallory's death.

784
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:49,834
那天是我想带梅罗丽去漂流的
It was my idea to take Mallory rafting that day.

785
01:05:51,538 --> 01:05:53,259
雷
Ray.

786
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,307
你不必为这个自责了
You can't blame yourself for what happened.

787
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,346
这是我的亲生孩子 感觉完全不一样
It's just different when it's your own kid.

788
01:06:01,446 --> 01:06:03,080
我知道
I know.

789
01:06:03,548 --> 01:06:06,451
有时候 我控制不了自己 去想她
Sometimes I can't get that look she had out of my head.

790
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:10,903
那一瞬间 当她意识到...
The moment she realized that...

791
01:06:12,212 --> 01:06:14,786
我救不了她的时候
I wasn't gonna be able to save her.

792
01:06:17,094 --> 01:06:19,723
每一天回家看到你和布雷克
And then coming home every day to you and Blake

793
01:06:19,724 --> 01:06:22,133
我这种念头就愈发强烈
only made it harder.

794
01:06:26,604 --> 01:06:30,887
因为一切都不一样了 原来是...
Because nothin' was the way it used to be. And the way it used to be was...

795
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,078
是完美的
It was perfect.

796
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:40,685
我应该和你谈谈的
I should've let you in.

797
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:46,788
我只是不知道怎么开口
I just didn't know how.

798
01:06:48,114 --> 01:06:52,031
我们走到今天这一步 我很抱歉 艾玛
I'm so sorry for how things ended with us, Em.

799
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:55,365
真的很抱歉
I really am.

800
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:03,342
如果连你都救不了我们女儿...
If you couldn't save our daughter...

801
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:06,567
那么没人救得了
then nobody could have.

802
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:16,823
我十分想念她
I miss her so much.

803
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,458
我也是
Me, too.

804
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:28,496
出发去接我们女儿吧
Let's go get our daughter.

805
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:57,292

过来 沿着撤退路线行进
Come on. Let's go. Follow the evacuation route.

807
01:08:00,097 --> 01:08:02,600
距离朗巴顿大街只有几个街区了
Just a few more blocks to Lombard Avenue,

808
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,002
走那条路就可以到科伊特塔了
which leads to Coit Tower.

809
01:08:08,205 --> 01:08:12,443
我能问你为什么戴两条一样的项链吗?
Do you mind if I ask why you wear two of the same necklaces?

810
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:19,016
其中一条曾经是我妹妹的
One of them used to be my sister's.

811
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,754
我... 她去世之后 我就戴着了
I... I started wearing it after she died.

812
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:27,091
我们是在她去世前一年的圣诞节上 把项链送给对方的
We had given them to each other for Christmas the year before.

813
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:33,631
- 我... 抱歉啊 我不是故意的...  - 没事 我本也没打算瞒着这事儿
- I'm... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...  - No. It's okay. I'm... I'm not hiding them.

814
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:39,270
嘿 快看
Hey. Check it out.

815
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:40,905
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

816
01:08:41,005 --> 01:08:44,341
他们应该有工具箱 里面有我们用的上的东西
They should have a supply box. It'll have stuff that we can use.

817
01:08:47,344 --> 01:08:48,980
是这个吗?
Is this it?

818
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:52,133
是的!
Yes!

819
01:08:52,983 --> 01:08:54,665
太棒了
Okay.

820

Every city has a tactical channel that first responders use to communicate on.

822
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,927
我们可以用这个知道他们在做什么
We can listen in and we can see what's going on.

823
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:04,440
好的
Okay.

824
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,230
- 拿着这些  - 好的

825
01:09:07,827 --> 01:09:09,464
- 还有这些  - MRE是什么?
- Take this.  - What's an MRE?

826
01:09:09,564 --> 01:09:13,938
即食餐饮 这东西保质期超过三年
Meals ready-to-eat. These things have a shelf life of over three years.

827
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:16,674
- 但是味道不怎么样  - 太赞了
- They don't taste so good.  - Cool.

828
01:09:16,874 --> 01:09:18,643
布雷克!
Blake!

829
01:09:18,983 --> 01:09:22,476
我觉得我们去不了你说的那个像喷嘴一样的塔了
I think we're going to have a problem with that big nozzle thing you were talking about.

830
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:24,250
什么?
What?

831
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,853
什么意思啊?
What do you mean?

832
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,620
天啊
Oh, my God.

833
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:38,462
我们得执行B计划了
We have to go to plan B.

834
01:09:38,562 --> 01:09:42,626
- 我不知道我们有B计划  - 现在有了
- I didn't think we had one.  - We do now.

835
01:09:45,186 --> 01:09:48,053
我们得去第二高的地方就可以给开直升机的老爸
We need to get to the next highest ground so that we can signal my dad

836
01:09:48,153 --> 01:09:49,977
- 发信号  - 那就是诺布山
- in the helicopter. - That would be Nob Hill.

837
01:09:50,077 --> 01:09:53,131
那是城里最高的地方 在反方向
It's the highest point in the city. It's the other way.

838
01:09:53,677 --> 01:09:55,769
- 好吧 快走  - 布... 不
- Okay. Come on. - Bl... no.

839
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,861

840
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,587
等一下
Just wait.

841
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:03,320
这边走 动起来 继续走
Coming through. Move, move, move.

842
01:10:26,343 --> 01:10:28,579
布雷克 我们会是往那里走的唯一几个人
Blake, we'd be the only ones going that way.

843
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,348
我爸爸说去高的地方 所以我们就要这么做
My dad said to get to higher ground, so that's what we gotta do.

844
01:10:31,548 --> 01:10:34,385
但是... 如果他没办法过来呢?
But... what if he doesn't make it?

845
01:10:35,385 --> 01:10:38,911
听着 我知道这听上去有点疯狂...
Listen, I know that this sounds crazy...

846
01:10:39,011 --> 01:10:40,875
但是你得相信我他会来的
but you have to trust me that he will.

847
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:47,564
我... 我不...

Did you know about the push-button phone working with the landline?

850
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,576
工具箱? 
The supply box?

851
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:00,916
战术无线电频道? 
Tactical radio channels?

852
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:06,317
我真的认为我们该跟她走
I really think we should stick with her.

853
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:16,822
好吧
Okay.

854
01:11:17,122 --> 01:11:19,329
看起来我们要去诺布山了
Looks like we're going to Nob Hill.

855
01:11:19,429 --> 01:11:22,486
好的 我们走

858
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:40,122
看上去整个城市都在撤离
Looks like the whole city's evacuating.

859
01:11:40,123 --> 01:11:42,592
艾玛 机场那边出问题了
Em, we got a problem at the airport.

860
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:50,997
我们要在哪降落?
Where are we gonna land?

861
01:11:50,998 --> 01:11:53,836
我们不能降落 至少不能在城市降落
We can't. At least, not in the city.

862
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,823
跟我来
Come with me.

863
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,927
好的
Okay.

864
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:29,099
你一定在开玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

865
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,502
艾玛 我们没地方降落这架飞机
Em, we have no place to set this plane down

866
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:34,371
而我们又得尽可能离科伊特塔近
and we have to get as close to Coit Tower as we possibly can.

867
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:36,473

In three minutes, we're gonna be over The Embarcadero.

868
01:12:36,573 --> 01:12:37,809
然后? 
And?

869
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:41,812
然后... 我们要跳伞落在AT&T球场
And... we're gonna drop into AT&T Park.

870
01:12:41,912 --> 01:12:45,003
- 但我不会跳伞  - 没问题 我们双人跳
- But I don't know how to parachute.  - That's okay. We're gonna tandem-jump.

相信我
Trust me.

875
01:13:02,766 --> 01:13:05,909
天啊!
Oh, my God!

876
01:13:10,374 --> 01:13:13,096
- 准备好了吗?  - 我听上去像准备好了吗? 
- You ready?  - Do I sound ready?

877
01:13:13,196 --> 01:13:14,398
像!
Yep!

878
01:14:14,738 --> 01:14:17,674
距离我跟你上二垒有些日子了
It's been a while since I got you to second base.

879
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:25,266
劳伦斯·黑斯博士通过电视广播发出的严肃警告...
With a grave warning from Dr. Lawrence Hayes blanketing the airwaves...

880

旧金山开始了撤离程序

海岸警卫队请拥有船只的人自愿...
The coast guard is asking anyone with access to a boat to will please volunteer...

882
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:35,860
断层线末端还没有移动
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

883
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,535
旧金山会再次发生地震 而且下一次会更加剧烈
San Francisco is going to get hit again, and this will be a much bigger monster.

884
01:14:41,966 --> 01:14:44,668
我希望我们已经给了大家足够的警告
I hope we've given everyone enough warning.

885
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:51,477
这就是了 对吗?
This is it, isn't it?

886
01:14:51,478 --> 01:14:53,978
我现在希望自己大错特错了
Right now I wanna be so wrong.

887
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:55,713
大家快找掩护!

你知道"诺布"
Did you know "nob"

890
01:15:11,194 --> 01:15:14,441
其实是"富有"或是"财富"的俚语吗?
is a slang term which means "rich" or "wealthy?"

891
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,001
这是"高贵"的简写
It's a shortened version of the word "nobility,"

892
01:15:17,101 --> 01:15:19,403
源于这里居住的家庭

893
01:15:19,503 --> 01:15:23,006
也被戏称为"势利山"

这幢楼会塌的 你得跑!
This building's gonna collapse. You need to move!

靠在坚固的物体旁边 保护自己

但我们怎么穿过去? 
But how do we get through that?

926
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,244
