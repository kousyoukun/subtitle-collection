And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

我們永遠品味十足
We never go out of style

14
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,550
救命
Help!!

15
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,740
我知道你們都是曾在阿富汗巴格拉姆
So, uh, I understand that you all were part

你們現在還在一起執行任務
And you're still flying together?

20
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,350
是的  我們發展了深厚的戰斗友誼
Yeah, we all got pretty tight over there.

21
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,950
像親人一樣密不可分
Wouldn't break up the family.

22
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,420
老兄  我們看起來像一家人嗎
Dude, do we look like family?

23
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,620
一點點吧
A little.

24
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,320
在那邊進行搜救
So, what's the biggest difference

25
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,730
和你在這堸答漲酗偵礞ㄕP
between rescuing over there and what you do here?

26
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,660
不用擔心吃槍子兒
Not getting shot at.

27
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,260
你真幽默
You're a funny guy.

28
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,170
還好吧
Yeah. Not exactly.

看起來很窄
Looks pretty tight.

39
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,100
救她上來
Take her up.

40
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,010
氣流不穩定

天U+5450  車在下滑
Oh, my God! The car is sliding.

直升機還能飛行一小時十五分
We show you one plus one five playtime.

62
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,800
夥計  我們沒法進去
Man, I don't see a way in.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,140
我們得"脫帽致敬"了
We're gonna tip the hat.

64
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,870
"脫帽致敬"
Tip the hat?

65
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,340
對  你最好抓穩了

All right. Tuck 'em in, boys.

73
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,170
喬比  不用帶救生籃
Joby, forget the basket.

74
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,410
這次我們直接固定車
We gotta do a double tie-in on this one.

75
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,710
車要是掉下去  她也會掉下去
That car goes, so does she.

76
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,320
門開了

可以下去了
On the skid.

80
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,670
我們最多只有五分鍾
We got five minutes max.

81
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,240
五分鍾之後會怎樣
What happens in five minutes?

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,480
沒什麼大不了的  引擎停轉而已
It's no big deal. Just engine failure.

83
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,280
還好我只需要三分鍾
Good thing I only need three.

84
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,760
-感謝上帝  -不  娜塔莉  不要
- Oh, thank God. - No, no! Natalie, do not--

85
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,320

86
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,260
娜塔莉  保持這個姿勢不要動
Natalie, I need you to stay perfectly still.

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,860
-我得先固定車子  -求你快一點
- I have to stabilize the car, okay? - Hurry, please.

88
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,270
車子固定了
Car secured.

89

成功
Got it.

90
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,520
這怎麼回事
What the hell?

91
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,590
該死
Shit.

92
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,700
迪蘭  天U+5450  你沒事吧
Dylan! Oh, my God. Are you all right?

93
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,900
上帝啊  喬比被壓住了
Jesus. Joby's pinned!

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,940
可惡
Ah, goddamn it.

95
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,320
喬比  我現在下來
Joby, I'm comin' down.

96
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,550
哈奡  你來飛  馬科斯  給我繩子
Harrison, you're flyin'. Marcus, rig me a rope.

-隨時准備割繩子  -收到
- Be ready to cut. - Roger that.

100
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
固定好了
Hooked up.

101
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,340
出艙門
Out the door.

102
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,770
雷已經准備好
Ray's clear.

103
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,820
娜塔莉  別擔心  我會救你出...
Natalie, don't you worry. I'm gonna get you outta--

104
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,590
這東西要撐不住了
This thing isn't gonna hold!

105
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,000
雷  油表爆紅了  我們要墜機了
Ray, we are in the red! We are going to crash!

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,360
娜塔莉  我們現在就走
Natalie, we are going now!

107
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,700
我抓住你了
I got you.

108
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,110
割繩子  喬比  往外蕩
Cut it! Joby, swing!

109
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,720
太好了
Yeah!

110
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,990
我們把你送回家怎麼樣
What do we say we get you home now?

111
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,960
我覺得是個好主意
I think that's a really good idea.

112
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
{\an8}加州理工大學
加州  帕薩迪納

113
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,430
日本的仙台地震是1900年以來
Now the Sendai quake in Japan was considered to be

114
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,070
發生過的最強烈的五次地震之一
one of the five strongest since 1900.

115
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,070
此次地震強度極大
It was so powerful, in fact,

116
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,410
甚至使日本的本州島偏移了兩點五米
that it moved the main island of Japan eight feet.

117
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,810
而這僅僅是全球每年發生的
This is just one of the 1.3 million earthquakes

118
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,280
一百三十萬起地震中的一起
that occur around the globe each year.

119
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,690
北美發生過的最強地震是1964年
The largest ever recorded here in North America:

120
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,890
發生於阿拉斯加州安克雷奇的9.1級地震
Anchorage, Alaska, 1964. A 9.1.

121
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,860
地震持續了整整五分鍾
The earth shook for five straight minutes.

122
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,230
釋放的能量
The energy release

123
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,000
相當於在廣島爆炸的
was the equivalent of ten million Atom bombs

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,600
原子彈的一千萬倍
the size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.

125
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,840
這還不是人類記錄到的最強地震
And that's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded.

126
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,310
不  最強的一次發生在四年之前
No, the biggest was four years earlier

127
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,210
就在智利南部的瓦爾迪維亞海岸
off the coast of Valdivia in Southern Chile.

128
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,850
堣9.5級地震
A 9.5 on the Richter scale.

129
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,680
就在那
Right there.

130
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,690
這次地震持續了十一分鍾
This quake lasted eleven minutes and spawned a tsunami

131
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,920
引發了高達二十五米的海嘯
eighty-two feet high that leveled Hilo, Hawaii,

132
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,690
並摧毀了一萬三千公堨~夏威夷的希羅市
eight thousand miles away.

133
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,100
一萬三千公堨~
Eight thousand miles away.

134
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,230
所以  如此大規模的災難
So, um, it's... it's mass destruction like this

135
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,900
告訴我們
that shows just how important

136
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,340
我們現在進行的研究是多麼重要
the research that we're doing here is,

137
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,610
因為我們需要能夠預警這樣的災難
because we need to be able to predict these things.

138
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,440
是吧  要能夠提前做好應對
Right? To plan and prepare for them.

139
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,210
-這位女士  -教授  您認為
- Yes, ma'am. - Professor, do you think

140
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,050
我們這堨i能發生劇烈地震嗎
something that intense could happen here?

141
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,520
聖安地列斯斷層
Well, the San Andreas fault

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,990
貫穿整個加利福尼亞州
runs right up the spine of California.

143
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,590
這堿O兩大不斷移動的
It's the demarcation line

144
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,520
構造板塊的分界線
between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving.

145
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,030
另外補充一個事實  每隔一百五十年左右
Well, and add to that the fact that it's supposed to happen

146
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,100
都應該會發生一次大地震
every one hundred and fifty years,

147
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,270
而我們已經超時一百年了
and we're about a hundred years overdue.

148
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,200
要我說這不是會不會發生的問題
I'd say it's not a matter of if.

149
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,110
而是什麼時候發生的問題
It's a matter of when.

150
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,410
該死  哥斯拉
Damn, Godzilla.

151
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,140
這次你他媽又對她做了什麼
What the hell did you do to her this time?

152
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,880
跟一輛車玩了次拔河
Played a little tug of war with a car.

153
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,220
你什麼時候能修好她
How soon before you get her fixed?

154
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,650
我今天會給馬丁內斯打電話
I'll call Martinez today.

155
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,250
把一架新飛機送去保養
Get a new one sent over to maintenance.

156
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,720
埃爾金  你再走快一點屁股就要骨折了
Elgin, you move any faster, you're gonna break that hip.

157
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,030
哈奡侄“A要請假陪布雷克幾天
Harrison said you're taking off with Blake for a few days.

158
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,190
是的  明天出發
Yeah. Leavin' tomorrow.

159
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,560
把她送回學校去
Driving her back up to school.

160
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,600
排球隊本周末舉行第一場比賽
Volleyball team has their first game this weekend,

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,300
我打算沿著海岸線開上去  露個營什麼的
so I figured we'd cruise up the coast. Do a little campin'.

162
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,800
老兄  我不敢相信她都上大學了
Dude, I can't believe she's in college already.

163
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,870
是啊  時間過得太快了
I know. Too fast, brother.

164
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,540
-等會兒進去找你  -好
- I'll catch you inside. - All right, man.

165

勞倫斯·海耶斯教授
金·帕克教授

166
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,180
勞倫斯  我有東西要給你看
Lawrence, I gotta show you something.

167
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,620
是嗎  放松  放松
Yeah? Aha. Easy. Easy.

168
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,090
我們在內華達州的法爾科檢測到
Now, we got a rare low-level seismic swarm

169
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,220
罕見的頻繁小震
out in Falco, Nevada.

170
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,260
整整二十三次2.0到2.6級之間的小震
Twenty-three small quakes, all tiny.

171
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,460
都發生在過去二十四小時之內
2.0 to 2.6 in the last twenty-four hours.

172
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,560
好吧  內華達州的法爾科在哪
Okay. Where the hell is Falco, Nevada?

173
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,400
維加斯東南方向約五十公
Thirty-five miles southeast of Vegas,

174
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,430
離胡佛大壩大概八公
Maybe five miles from the Hoover dam.

175
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,500
好吧
Right.

176
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
那邊並沒有斷層
There aren't any faults out there.

177
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,700
沒有已知的斷層
Any known faults.

178
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,810
如果我們能在小震持續期間過去
Now, if we get there while the mini quakes continue,

179
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,870
就能驗證我們的理論
we can test our theory.

180
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,880
如果地震發生前磁脈沖率升高
And if the magnetic pulse rate goes up before the quakes...

181
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,080
那我們就能預測地震
then we're predicting them.

182
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,410
那我們就能預測地震
Then we are predicting them.

183
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,320
那好  我們去探個究竟
All right. Let's go check it out.

184
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,510
-你好  爸爸  -你好  寶貝
- Hi, Dad. - Hey, sweetie.

185
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,070
你車上有沒有位置放我的單車
I was wondering if there was room for my bike.

186
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,510
我想著到時能騎車去上課
I thought that I could ride it to class

187
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,580
這樣就不用買停車卡了
and then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.

188
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,850
這主意不錯
That's a great idea.

189
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,580
我肯定能騰出地方塞下車子的
I'm sure I could figure out a way to fit it in.

190
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,680
那就好
All right, great.

191
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,150
我沒在我媽這塈鋮鴞萓璅料_匙
Um, I can't find the key to the lock at mom's,

192
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,550
不是在我梳妝台左邊最上面的抽屜
so it's either in the top left drawer of my dresser

193
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,020
就是在我衣櫃頂上粉色的鞋盒
or on top of the wardrobe in my pink shoe box.

194
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,690
好吧  沒問題  我去找
Hm? Okay, no problem. I'll find it.

195
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,330
你今晚有安排嗎
Don't know if you have plans tonight,

196
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,990
我想帶你去吃晚餐
but I would love to take you to dinner.

197
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,060
你還可以請上你媽
You could even invite your mom along.

198
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,660
-應該會很有趣  -謝啦  爸爸
- Could be fun. - Oh, thanks, Dad.

199
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,670
我們跟丹尼爾已經有安排了
But we already have plans with Daniel.

200
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,240
爸
Dad?

201
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,940
-你沒事吧  -我當然沒事
- Are you Okay? - Yeah, of course I am.

202
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,280
沒事  完全沒事
Totally cool. No problem at all.

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,410
好吧  那我們明天見
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

204
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,380
好
Okay.

205
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,150
對了  別忘了單車鑰匙
Oh, and don't forget the bike key.

206
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,220
不會忘的  我記住了
I won't. I got it.

207
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,380
老爸再見  我愛你
Bye, Dad. I love you.

208
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,820
好  我也愛你  寶貝
Okay. I love you, too, honey.

209
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,320
再見
Bye.

Lawrence, it's incredible.

214
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,290
這已經是我們過來以後第三波小震了
This is the third mini quake since we've been here.

215
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,160
每一次發生之前
And the magnetic pulse rate has increased

216
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,200
磁脈沖率都升高了
before each one of them.

217
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,470
我們抓住規律了  我的朋友
We got a pattern, my friend.

218
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,970
剛剛是2.0級  我們的模型能夠預測
That was a 2.0. Our model's predictive.

219
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,940
我們終於成功了
Oh! We got it right, man! Finally!

220
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,040
當然
Yep, we sure did.

221
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,710
該死
Oh, shit.

222
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,950
怎麼了
What's wrong?

223
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,320
脈沖信號又上升了  這次極強
Pulse rates are spikin' again. They're huge.

224
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,920
你說真的嗎
Are you serious?

金
Kim?

226
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,160
要發生一場強震了
We're about to have a major quake.

227
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,030
數字升到了7.1級
It jumped to a 7.1!

228

你趕緊出來
Get the hell outta there!

230
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,610
大家趕快離開大壩  快點
Everybody get off the dam! Move! Now! Now!

內華達州南部今天發生了一場
The southern part of Nevada was rocked today

246
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,300
被地震學家們形容為
by what seismologists are calling

247
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,170
該地區"最具毀滅性"的強震
the most destructive earthquake ever reported in that area.

248
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,880
官方聲明稱胡佛大壩被完全摧毀
Officials are saying that Hoover dam is a total loss.

-受災損失的報告...  -爸爸
- reports that the total loss... - Hi, Dad.

255
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,930
寶貝
Hey, honey.

256
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,800
我們剛看到新聞
We just saw the news.

257
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
我知道  我很抱歉
I know. I'm so sorry.

258
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,070
我們明天出發
We're headin' out tomorrow.

259
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,330
我知道  這次災情非常嚴重
No, I get it. This one's really bad, dad.

260
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,000
這次災情是很嚴重
Yeah, this one's tough.

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,140
根據地震發生的形式
Earthquakes can rise and fall in intensity

262
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,010
震級很可能發生巨大變化
during their duration depending on the way...

263
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,180
-見到你很高興  -我也是
- Good to see - You, too.

-我們終於見面了  -見到你也很高興
- Good to finally meet you. -It's good to meet you, too.

266
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,820
你這地方真不錯
Heck of a place you got here, man.

267
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,150
-多謝  -不用
- Ah, thank you. - Welcome.

268
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,690
所以  爸爸明天要去內華達州
So, um... Dad is heading to Nevada tomorrow.

269
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,620
發生這種事真是太糟了
Oh, it's terrible what happened.

270
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,390
在那邊要注意安全
Please be safe over there, okay?

271
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,700
我們會的  而且我保證我會彌補你的
Yeah, we will. And I promise I'm gonna make it up to you, honey.

272
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,360
爸  真的沒關系
Dad, it's really no problem.

273
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,100
開過去沒什麼大不了的
The drive is not that bad.

274
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,270
等等  不如我帶你過去吧
Wait. Why don't I take you up there.

275
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,440
我要飛去舊金山開會
I'm flying up to San Francisco for a meeting.

276
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,970
我們可以開完會再去西雅圖
We can head up to Seattle right after.

277
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,370
這樣我就有機會去看排球賽了
It'll give me an opportunity to catch a volleyball game.

278
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,580
好主意
That's a good idea.

279
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,180
這樣你媽媽搬進來的時候
And it'll give your mom a chance

280
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,340
也不會嫌我礙手礙腳的
to get all her stuff moved in without me in the way.

281
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,410
是啊
Right.

282
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,720
你們要搬到一起住嗎
You guys movin' in?

283
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,950
對  我打算告訴你的
Yeah. I-I was meaning to tell you,

284
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,320
但我們之前沒找到機會...
but we haven't had a chance to...

285
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,920
恭喜
Congratulations.

286
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,560
謝謝
Thank you.

287
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,360
謝謝
Thanks.

288
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,600
真棒
That's great.

289
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,070
到那之後給我打電話
Call me when you get there.

290
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,470
-我會的  -好的
- I will. - All right.

291
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,800
我愛你  爸爸  你千萬小心啊
I love you, dad. You be careful, please.

292
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,910
我會的  我會的  我也愛你
I will, I will. I love you, too.

293
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,140
我去拿她的自行車
I'll get her bike.

294
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,310
我很遺憾  你們不能一起去
I'm sorry you guys can't go up there together.

295
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,420
對  我也很遺憾
Yep. Me, too.

296
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,520
雷  雷
Ray. Ray.

297
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,450
我本來要告訴你的
I was gonna tell you.

298
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,220
我們剛剛決定的
We just decided to do it.

299
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,130
別擔心
Don't worry about it.

300
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,170
如果你想要他們
Hey, if you want them --

301
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,000
我也會把你寄來的那些文件簽了
I'll get those papers signed for you, too.

302
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,730
那是一個星期日下午
Um, it was a Sunday afternoon.

303
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,560
很明顯  人們沒去上班
Um, obviously, people weren't at work.

304
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,060
他們也沒睡著
They weren't as-- asleep.

305
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,200
即便如此  我們也知道破壞程度非常...
Even so, we know the devastation was fairly...

306
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,330
真嚴重
This is bad.

307
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,400
對
Yeah.

308
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,870
我們什麼時候出發
What time we headin' out?

309
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,640
14時30分  大家在准備工具
Fourteen-thirty. Guys are preppin' the gear now.

310
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,340
好  我們開工吧
All right. Let's get to work.

311
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,210
正在進行的救援行動極其複雜
It's a fairly sophisticated rescue operation underway.

312
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,080
這麼說  這個丹尼爾要把布雷克帶走
So this Daniel guy's taking Blake now?

313
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,980
換成我  我就直接請假了
I woulda just called in sick.

314
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,390
所以我是老大  你不是
Uh, it's why I'm the boss and you're not.

315
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,620
我很確定  沒有你我們也能應付幾天
Oh, pretty sure we can manage a few days without ya.

316
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,260
你鞋帶開了
Shoe's untied.

317
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,900
你在逗我嗎
Are you kidding me?!

318
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,640
布雷克
Blake.

319
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,610
我想讓你知道
I want you to know that I respect

320
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,950
我尊重你和你爸爸之間的感情
what you and your dad have.

321
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,620
我知道你媽媽搬來住
And I know that your mom moving in

322
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,120
是很重大的一步
has to feel like a pretty big step.

323
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,250
但我永遠都不會試著改變
But I'm never gonna try to change

324
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,090
你們父女間的感情  也不會試著取代他
what you have with him or take his place.

325
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,560
好嗎
Okay?

326
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,260
好
Yeah.

327
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,160
那就好
Okay, cool.

328
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,270
為什麼你沒有孩子
Hey, how come you never had kids?

329
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,240
我有孩子
Oh, I did.

330
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,440
這就是其中之一
This is one of them right here.

331
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,140
她為舊金山的景色
She's a pretty nice addition

332
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,610
-增添了魅力  是不是  -"大門"
- to the San Francisco skyline, don't you think? - "The gate."

333
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,250
-名字很好記  是吧  -對  我喜歡它
- Catchy, right? - Yeah, I like it.

334
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,180
媽媽以前跟我說過
Mom was telling me about this.

335
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,250
她說這是城市中最高的建築  是嗎
She said it's the tallest building in the city, right?

336
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,990
它完工後  就會是最高的
When it's finished, it'll be the tallest,

337
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,960
也是最堅固的建築  而且已經賣出去八成了
strongest and it's already eighty percent sold.

338
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,890
但說實話  我覺得我沒有孩子
But, honestly, I guess I never had any kids

339
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,230
是因為我總是忙著建造[養育]高樓大廈
'cause I was always so busy raising these.

340
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,510
{\an8}奧克蘭機場

341
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,010
媽媽發短信說  她今天要和你姐姐共進午餐
Mom texted. She's having lunch with your sister today.

342
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,710
對  她進城沒幾天
Yeah, she's only in town for a few days

343
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,980
很想見她
and really wanted to meet her.

344
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,540
但我有點緊張
I'm a little nervous though.

345
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,550
蘇珊可能有點保護欲過強
Susan can be kind of overprotective.

346
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,850
謝謝
Thank you.

347
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,450
{\an8}舊金山

348
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,520
喬納森
Jonathan.

349
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,820
早上好  雷迪克先生
Good morning, Mr. Riddick.

350
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,030
早上好  你自己沒問題吧  布雷克
Morning. Gonna be okay, Blake?

351
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,690
沒問題
Yeah, I'll be fine.

352
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,270
你好
Hi.

353
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,370
你好
Hello.

354
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,690
抱歉  勞倫斯  需要我給你拿點什麼嗎
I'm sorry, Lawrence. Can I get you anything?

355
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,490
不用了  阿列克謝  謝謝
No. I'm fine, Alexi. Thank you.

356
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,690
你真的想待在這嗎
Are you sure you want to be here?

357
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,690
說實話  我確實需要分分心
I can use the distraction, actually.

358
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,030
什麼事
Yeah?

359
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,070
外面有個記者
There's a reporter outside.

360
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,570
她說她在寫一篇關於內華達事件的文章
Says she's doing a segment on what happened in Nevada.

361
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,910
我去告訴她  現在不合適
I'm gonna tell her that it's not a good time.

362
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,510
不  等一下
No, wait a minute.

363
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,640
金為了這個結果付出了生命
Kim gave his life for this.

364
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,950
人們得知道
People need to know

365
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,750
我們現在可以預測地震了
that we can predict these things now.

366
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,830
{\an8}震顫
地震學新突破
勞倫斯·海耶斯教授與金·帕克博士合著

367
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,350
你想要一本嗎
You want a copy?

368
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,260
我這媮晹酗@千多本存貨呢
I got about a thousand in storage.

369
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,590
我想  大地顫抖之前  沒人會聽我們的
No one listens to us until the ground shakes, I guess.

370
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,130
他們把你同事的遭遇告訴我了
You know, they told me what happened to your colleague.

371
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,460
我們不必馬上就開始
We don't have to do this now.

372
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,870
不  有必要
Yeah, we do.

373
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,370
我們可以開始了
We're good to go.

374
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,270
-好  -好
- Okay. - OKay.

375
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,440
開始
Rolling.

376
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,040
第一個問題
First question:

377
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,580
為什麼沒人預見內華達州的慘劇呢
how come no one saw what happened in Nevada coming?

378
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,580
因為我們之前不知道那邊有斷層
Because we didn't know there were any fault lines out there.

379
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,780
為什麼不知道
Why not?

380
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,120
與公眾認知相反的是
Contrary to popular belief,

381
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,150
科學家並不是萬事通
scientists don't know everything.

382
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,050
我理解你曾公開說過  總有一天
I understand that you publicly stated that, someday,

383
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,790
科學家能夠預測地震
scientists will be able to predict earthquakes.

384
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,490
其實就是昨天起
Well, actually as of yesterday,

385
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,430
我們現在相信  我們可以預測地震
we now believe that we can predict them.

386
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,830
教授
Professor!

387
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,930
跟你說句話
Talk to you a sec?

388
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,840
好  我很抱歉  失陪一下
Yeah. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

389
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,370
怎麼了
What is it?

390
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,070
這是觀測站的電流脈沖頻率
Current pulse rates at our monitoring stations.

391
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,710
全都是沿著聖安地列斯斷層的
All along the San Andreas Fault.

392
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,210
平均值高達82到85
Their averages are spiking from eighty-two to eighty-five,

393
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,610
激增最快處是在舊金山
with the biggest jumps coming from San Francisco.

394
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,810
比我們在內華達看見的
More than twenty points higher

395
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,050
還高20個百分點
than what we saw in Nevada.

396
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,220
不不不  不可能這樣
No. No, no, no. There's no way.

397
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,580
我們檢查過了  而且我們覆核過了
We checked. We double-checked.

398
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,290
然後我們又重置所有儀器
Then we reset all the instruments

399
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,120
檢查了第三遍  數據就是這樣的
and triple-checked. Those are the counts.

400
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,620
等一下  等一下
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

401
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,490
等一下
Wait a minute.

402
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,760
好...
Okay, uh...

403
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,830
如果...
If, uh...

404
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,100
如果我們畫一條從聖安地列斯斷層南端
If we draw a line from the bottom of the San Andreas

405
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,370
到胡佛水壩的線
up to the Hoover Dam,

406
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:57,910
它幾乎完全和科羅拉多河平行
it almost literally follows the Colorado River,

407
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,410
它是天然的變形作用
which is a natural deformation event.

408
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:07,520
從地質學上講  變形作用能標明邊界
And geologically, deformation events mark boundaries.

409
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,190
它們標明邊界
They mark boundaries.

410
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,860
那如果...
So, what if...?

411
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,360
如果這一大片陸地
What if this whole chunk of land

412
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,170
都和構造板塊相連呢
is connected to our tectonic plate?

413
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,030
那就表明  昨天在內華達發生的事
That would tell us that what happened yesterday in Nevada

414
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,900
並非異常

你是說你覺得
Are you saying you think

419
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,490
整個聖安地列斯斷層可能會活動
the whole San Andreas Fault might go off?

420
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,190
對  我就是這個意思

布雷克對此感覺如何

00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,910
快走  餘震又來了
Come on. It's another aftershock.

691
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,810
-我們得趕緊離開  -好的
- We've got to get out of here. - Okay!

692
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,950
小心  快  快點
Look out! Hurry! Come on!

693
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,050
我們得離這些大樓遠點
We have to get away from these buildings.

694
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,490
-布雷克  -神啊
- Blake. - Oh, my God.

695
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,390
布雷克  這邊  這邊
Blake! This way! This way!

696
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,030
-神啊  -我的天啊
- Jesus! - Oh, my god!

697
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,770
奧利  布雷克
Ollie! Blake!

698
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,210
快  跑跑跑
Come on! Go! Go!

699
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,490
真不敢相信丹尼爾就這麼跑了
I cannot believe that Daniel just took off.

700
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,790
簡直混蛋
What an asshole.

701
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:00,320
所有人讓開
Step aside, people.

702
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,190
我得聯系我爸媽
I gotta get ahold of my parents.

703
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,830
讓他們知道我沒事了
I gotta let them know I'm okay.

704
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,860
手機沒信號  我試過了
Cellphones aren't working. I've tried.

705
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:10,230
我們需要一個電子商店
We need to find an electronics store.

706
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:14,270
你那本書埵陸茤惚H息嗎
Does that book of yours list businesses?

707
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,780
我的書堣偵繷ㄕ
My book has everything.

708
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,740
好消息是我們大部分應急系統
The good news is most of our emergency systems

709
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,580
-還能用  -給
- are still working. - Here.

710
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,350
有十七台檢測儀還有信號
We've got signals coming in from seventeen monitors.

711
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,450
剛剛的地震9.1級
We just experienced a 9.1.

712
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,360
勞倫斯  你得過來看看
Lawrence... you need to see this.

713
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,300
有什麼消息
What do we got?

714
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,530
這是地震前的脈沖率
Here are the pulse rates before the quake.

715
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,770
好的  然後呢
Yeah, okay.

716
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,740
這是現在的脈沖率
And here are the pulse rates now.

717
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,040
一樣
The same.

718
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,380
甚至更高
Or higher.

719
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,380
地震並未使脈沖率降低
So the earthquake didn't diminish them.

720
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,980
天哪
Oh, man.

721
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,920
大事不妙了
Oh, this is not good.

722
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,850
阿列克謝  我需要斷層沿線
Alexi, I want all the data from every monitoring station

723
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,660
檢測站的所有數據  現在就去拿
still up along the fault line and get it for me now.

724
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,220
-好的  -怎麼回事
- Right. - What's going on?

725
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,590
-還沒結束  -不是吧
- This is not over. - Shit.

726
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,900
倒黴  燒壞了
Oh, man. This thing's fried.

727
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,870
快來  大家都跟我來
Come on. I need everybody.

728
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,170
-要我們幹什麼  -直播新聞
- W-what are we doing? - Gettin' you on the air.

729
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:18,500
我們得提醒大家
We need to warn people.

730
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,300
怎麼做啊  沒辦法傳輸信號啊
How? There's no way to upload a signal.

731
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,940
呵呵  這堨i是加州理工
Ho ho ho. You're at caltech.

732
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,650
{\an8}媒體實驗室

733
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,590
誰想參加一次獨立研究
Okay, who wants an a in independent study?

734
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,050
現在我開設一門新課
I'm startin' a new class:

735
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,490
怎麼通過入侵媒體網絡拯救生命
"How to save lives by hacking media outlets."

736
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:42,030
酷  我要加入
Hell yeah, man. I'm in.

737
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,900
棒  拿上電腦我們走
Sweet, bro. Get your laptop. Let's go.

738
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,770
這邊  快  快
Right here. Move, move, move.

739
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,970
好的  起來  用力
Here we go. Up. Lift.

740
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,440
應該就在前面
It should be just up ahead.

741
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,510
在那
There it is.

742
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,090
所有用電的應該都沒用了
Okay, anything running on electricity isn't gonna work,

743
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,190
所以需要找手搖發電或者按鍵式電話
so we have to find a rotary or a push button phone.

744
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,290
你怎麼知道這些的
How do you know all this?

745
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,660
我爸  他是洛杉磯消防員
My dad. He works for L.A. fire and rescue.

746
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,870
這邊
Over here.

747
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,440
太好了  我去找根地線
Great. I'll look for a landline.

748
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,090
找到了
I got one!

749
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,900
-布雷克  -爸

750
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,230
爸爸  我出來了  我沒事
Dad. I got out. I'm okay.

751
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,870
她沒事
She's okay.

752
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,440
讓我跟她講話
Oh. Let me talk to her.

753
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:02,970
布雷克
Blake?

754
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,580
媽媽
Mom?

755
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,640
感謝上帝  寶貝
Oh, thank god, honey.

756
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,980
丹尼爾沒事吧
Is Daniel okay?

757
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,320
他丟下我跑了  媽媽
He left me, Mom.

758
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,520
他幹了什麼
He what?

759
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,250
他跟一個保安說了我在哪
He told a security guard where I was

760
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,890
然後就走掉了
and then he just took off

761
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,620
有兩兄弟碰巧聽到
and these two brothers that I met overheard him

762
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,390
才來救了我
and they came to help me.

763
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,090
我現在和他們在一起
I'm with them right now.

764
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,430
他丟下她跑了
He left her?!

765
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,000
我們這就來救你  寶貝  你在哪
We're comin' to get you, honey. Where are you?

766
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,340
我在唐人街的一個電器商店
I'm in an-an electronics store in chinatown.

767
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,640
寶貝  不會有事的
Honey, it's gonna be okay,

768
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,210
但我需要你仔細聽我說
but I need you to listen to me.

769
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,510
想離開那
Getting outta there

770
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,340
交通肯定無比艱難
is gonna be a complete gridlock nightmare,

771
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,040
所以找個高地  更安全
so get to higher ground. It's safer.

772
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,910
-高地上也好讓我找到你  -好的
- That's where I'm gonna be able to see you. - Okay.

773
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,650
你還記得我們給梅洛媢L生日的周末嗎
Do you remember where we spent Mallory's birthday weekend?

774
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:45,780
科伊特塔
At Coit Tower?

775
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,590
記得  山上那個很高的
Yeah. That-that tall

776
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,720
-水泥管道樣的東西  -沒錯
- cement nozzle thing on the hill. - Exactly.

777
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,090
不要停留  直接去那
Don't stop anywhere. Go there.

778
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,220
我們就在那見
That's where we'll meet.

779

堅強下去寶貝  我們這就來救你
Stay strong, honey. We're comin' to get you.

00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,800
好的  等等  媽媽
Okay. Wait, mom. Mom.

781
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,430
你怎麼會和爸爸在一起的
How-how are you and dad together?

782
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,170
過後再解釋吧  好嗎寶貝
We'll explain later. Okay, honey?

783
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,240
我愛你
I love you.

784
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,810
我也愛你們  拜拜
I love you guys. Bye.

785
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,290
我是丹尼爾
Hi, you've reached Daniel.

786
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,990
請給我留言  我會及時回複
Please leave me a message and I'll get back to you.

787
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,290
你扔下我女兒自己跑了
You left my daughter?

788
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,590
如果你還沒死  我也會親手弄死你
If you're not already dead, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

789
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:35,030
漂亮
Thatta girl.

790
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,000
好的  我們得走了
All right, we need to get going.

791
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,710
你爸爸要怎麼來接我們
So how is your dad going to pick us up?

792
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,680
他開著直升機過來
He's on his way in a helicopter.

793
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,980
好酷啊
That's so cool.

794
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,950
我需要你在地圖上找一下科伊特塔
I need you to look up Coit Tower on your map.

795
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,990
該你了
It's your turn.

796
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,020
你爸媽肯定要急瘋了
Your parents will be worried sick.

797
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,960
謝謝
Thank you.

798
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,330
往大道上走
Stay on the street.

799
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,040
我們要去哪
Where are we going?

800
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,900
給我讓開
Get out of my way!

801
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,070
那是我的位置
Hey! That was my spot!

802
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:06,120
知道嗎  你剛才和布雷克通話時
You know, when you were talking to Blake

803
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,290
是我們失去梅洛堨H來我第一次聽見
that was the first time I heard you say Mallory's name

804
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,900
你說她的名字
since we lost her.

805
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,570
你知道布雷克還留著
Hey, do you know that Blake keeps pictures

806
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,340
舊金山之行的照片嗎
from our San Francisco trip?

807
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,140
知道  在她的紀念物盒子
Yeah, in her memory box.

808
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,610
真諷刺啊  我們又要故地重遊了
It's ironic. Us heading back up there.

809
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,950
那次玩的很開心
It was a fun trip.

810
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,090
這是哪
Where are we?

811
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,060
貝克斯菲爾德  或者說它的殘部
Bakersfield. Or what's left of it.

812
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,170
離舊金山還有九十分鍾
We're just about ninety minutes from San Francisco.

813
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,840
雷
Ray?!

814
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,490
你是不是把引擎關了
Did you just turn off the engine?

815
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,750
是的  變速箱故障
Yeah, we got a gearbox failure.

816
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,220
肯定是因為洛杉磯被撞的那下
Must've been that hit we took in L.A.

817
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,120
我現在要自旋降落了
I'm gonna have to autorotate down.

818
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,230
自旋什麼
A-auto-what?

819
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,400
就是墜落
We're gonna crash.

820
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,670
-好吧  好的  -抓緊
- Right. Okay. - Hold on.

821
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,830
開始了
Here we go.

822
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,650
抓緊
Hold on!

823
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,490
我的天啊
Oh, my god!

824
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,590
快到了  快到了
Almost there. Almost there.

825
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,430
只要停那奡N好
Just gonna set it down right here.

826
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,080
身上都是汽油了  得趕緊離開
We got fuel all over us. We need to get outta here.

827
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,230
快  我們走
Come on. We gotta go.

828
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,030
-低下身子  底下身子  -好的
- Stay low. Stay low. - Okay.

829
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,810
沒事  我們繼續走
It's okay. We just gotta keep movin'.

830
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,140
-繼續走  -好的
- Just gotta keep movin'. - All right.

831
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,380
給我
Give it to me!

832
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,710
不  那是我的
No! It's mine!

833
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,960
走走走  快走快走
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

834
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,070
進去進去進去
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

835
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,070
看來是偷來的
Looks like it's been stolen.

836
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:08,510
好吧  那再讓我們偷一次
All right. Well, we'll steal it again.

837
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,350
雷
Ray.

838
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,180
慢點
Easy.

839
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,320
這輛車是我的
I'll be needin' that truck.

840
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,560
想都別想
Not today.

841
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,430
我的天
Oh, my god.

842
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,040
本次地震震中
The quake centered

843
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,850
位於洛杉磯市中心以西32公堛近
about twenty miles east of downtown Los Angeles.

844
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,250
目前大量信號塔倒塌
Cell towers are down.

845
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,480
城市大部分地區供電中斷
Most of the city's electricity, down.

846
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,980
對外通訊完全中斷
Communication at a virtual standstill.

847
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,190
預計南加州地區
The devastation to Southern California

848
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,620
災情嚴重
is expected to be massive.

849
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,620
整個加州將遭受嚴重打擊
In fact, the entire state will take a hit.

850
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,160
我們已接到目前所在建築的倒塌報告...
We're already getting reports of collapsed buildings...

851
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,790
成功了
We're in.

852
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,560
覆蓋從舊金山北部至整個灣區
As far north as San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area.

853
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,500
目前至少還發生過五次餘震
There have been at least five aftershocks

854
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,330
可以開始了
Okay. Here we go.

855
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,100
制作人表示災後首次
Uh, producers are telling us

856
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,240
接到來自洛杉磯的現場報道
we have our first live feed from Los Angeles.

857
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,470
准備  五  四...
We're rolling. Five, four...

858
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,210
塞雷娜·約翰遜在加州理工學院
Serena Johnson is on the ground

859
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,410
地震學中心為您報道
at the Seismology Center at Caltech.

860
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,380
你好  克奡
Hello, Chris.

861
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,180
在我身邊的是勞倫斯·海耶斯博士
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Hayes,

862
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,550
加州理工學院地震研究系常務主任
Executive Director for Earthquake Studies at Caltech.

863
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,350
他與研究夥伴金·帕克博士
He and his research partner, Dr. Kim Park,

864
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,890
共同建立了能夠預測地震的模型
have come up with a model that predicts earthquakes.

865
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,290
他們預測出這次洛杉磯的地震
They knew LA was going to get hit.

866
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,060
但卻被置之不理
But nobody listened to them.

867
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,830
現在請聽他說  交給你了  博士
It's time now to listen. Go ahead, Doctor.

868
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,700
好的  以地震學術語來講
Okay. Um, in seismology terms,

869
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,170
我們現在經曆的是地震群現象
what we're experiencing is what we call a swarm event.

870
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,130
基本上  整個加州的
Um, basically, California's

871
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,170
地質構造發生了位移
entire tectonic plate has shifted.

872
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,970
是的  我們似乎發現
Yes, it seems the quake we experienced here

873
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,240
洛杉磯地震對北至舊金山的
in Los Angeles did major damage

874
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,670
廣大地區造成了嚴重破壞
all the way up in San Francisco.

875
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,380
沒錯  但他們感受到的地震
Yeah. Yeah, but the earthquake that they felt

876
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,080
來自加州中央穀地斷層線的
was from movement along the fault line

877
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,510
地質運動
in the Central Valley.

878
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,510
目前舊金山的斷層線尚未移動
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

879
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,880
但重要的一點是人們必須知道
Uh, more importantly, people need to know

880
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,420
地震還沒有結束
that the shaking is not over.

881
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,390
我說的不是餘震
And it's not aftershocks I'm talking about.

882
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,460
舊金山將再次出現地震
San Francisco will get hit again.

883
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,290
規模將比這次更大
And it's going to be a bigger monster this time.

884
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,690
模型預測的地震強度為9.5級或更高
Our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater.

885
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:13,760
加州即將出現的下一次地震
It will be so big that even though it's happening

886
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,030
強度十分之高
here in California

887
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:19,600
甚至在東海岸也會有震感
you will feel it on the East Coast.

888
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,470
現在我強烈警告各位
Now, I cannot emphasize this enough

889
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,510
請舊金山全體市民注意
to the people of San Francisco:

890
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,880
你們必須馬上撤離  馬上
You need to get out. And I mean now.

891
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,310
如果無法撤離
And, if you can't,

892
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,200
請你務必設法
you need to find any means possible

893
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,550
蹲下  尋找掩護  並抓牢固定物體
to drop, cover and hold on.

894
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:38,660
因為這樣也許能救你一命
Because your life is gonna depend on it.

895
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,990
願上帝與你們同在
God be with you.

896
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,660
{\an8}金城
舊金山

897
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,430
洛杉磯地區
Aftershocks continue

898
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,000
持續發生餘震...
to rock the Los Angeles area...

899
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,100
你有沒有想過如果梅洛媮晹b世的話
You ever think about what our life would be like

900
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,340
我們的生活會是怎樣
if we hadn't lost Mallory?

901
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,870
建議市民...
People are advised to...

902
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,980
沒想過
Em, don't.

903
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,710
我常常這麼想
I do. All the time.

904
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,210
我們已經走出來了
We've moved on.

905
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,910
不  我們沒有走出來
No, we didn't move on.

906
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:07,120
我們一直在原地踏步
We stopped moving.

907
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,120
她的死不是你的錯
You didn't lose her on your watch.

908
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,250
但我還是永遠失去她了
No. But I lost her.

909
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,520
我們現在能不談這個嗎
Can we not talk about this?

910
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,360
你欠我一個交代
You owe it to me.

911
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,660
這件事
This!

912
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,160
自從她死後你就三緘其口
This is the most I've gotten out of you since she died.

913
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,560
我想知道真相  雷
I need to know, Ray.

914
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,870
是我的錯嗎  我做錯了什麼
Was-was it me? What did I do?

915
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,800
我從沒有怪過你
Because I never blamed you.

916
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,140
我不想談這個
I don't wanna talk about it.

917
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,910
這已經不重要了  她已經不在了
I-it doesn't matter. She's gone.

918
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,210
現在你也要離開我了
Now you're gone.

919
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,010
還有什麼意義
What's the point?

920
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,580
我想意義在於
I guess the point is

921
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,850
這就是為什麼我離開了你
this is why I didn't stick around.

922
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,890
當心  當心
Hey! Look out! Watch out!

923
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,660
快停車
Hey! Hey! You have to stop!

924
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,700
雷
Ray!

925
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,300
這是什麼
What is this?

926
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,170
聖安地列斯斷層
The San Andreas Fault.

927
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:47,720
我早說過我們應該走另一條路
I told you we should've gone the other way.

928
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,690
因為你能未卜先知嗎
Because you knew this was gonna happen?

929
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,490
你這人真是
You!

930
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,360
-我們欠你們一聲謝謝  -真的
- We owe you guys a huge thanks. - Really.

931
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,360
別客氣
No need.

932
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,870
我們自己差點也犯了同樣的錯
We nearly made the same mistake ourselves

933
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:05,700
但車軸斷了所以撞向路邊
but busted an axle when we ran off the road.

934
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,240
幸好我的眼神比他好多了
Thank goodness my eyes are better'n his.

935
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:10,910
你知道還有別的路可走嗎
Do you know if there's any way around this?

936
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:15,310
198號州際公路可能還能走
Well, uh... the one-ninety-eight might not be out.

937
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,650
-出口那邊  -有多遠
- Through the pass. - How far is that?

938
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:21,780
那得原路返回大概一百多公
Oh, ya gotta backtrack, maybe, seventy miles or so.

939
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,040
{\an8}博奇航空

940
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,830
如果您不介意的話我想問問
Sir, if you don't mind me askin'...

941
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,500
您的帽子是哪買的
where'd you get your hat?

942
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,600
你們幫了我們一個大忙
You guys really bailed us out.

943
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:40,300
{\an8}博奇航空

944
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,100
你確定不用我們帶你們飛一程嗎
You sure we can't fly you anywhere?

945
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,110
不用了  我們兒子住山
Yeah. Our son lives in the mountains.

946
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:43,370
那堥S地方降落
There's no place to land.

947
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:46,140
-謝謝你幫我們修車  -不客氣
- Thanks for the wheels. - You bet.

948
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,780
-保重  -再見
- Be safe. - Bye.

949
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,560
再過幾分鍾油就加滿了
We should be fueled up in a couple of minutes.

950
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,730
太好了
Okay, great.

951
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,070
一切都還好嗎
Everything okay?

952
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,610
你之前問我是不是你的錯
You asked me before if it was you.

953
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:24,310
不是你的錯
It wasn't.

954
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,120
我知道你沒有怪我
I knew you didn't blame me.

955
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:35,460
我只是無法接受梅洛堛漲
I-- I just didn't know how to deal with Mallory's death.

956
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,840
那天是我提議帶梅洛堨h劃船的
It was my idea to take Mallory rafting that day.

957
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,240
雷
Ray.

958
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,010
這一切你不能都怨到自己頭上
You can't blame yourself for what happened.

959
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:01,250
這事到了自己孩子身上是不一樣的
It's just different when it's your own kid.

960
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,390
我知道
I know.

961
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:03,950
-爸爸  -梅洛
- Dad! - Mallory!

962
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:06,460
有時候她的臉在我腦海中揮之不去
Sometimes I can't get that look she had outta my head.

963
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,090
當她那一刻意識到
The moment she realized that

964
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,830
我救不了她的時候
I wasn't gonna be able to save her.

965
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,870
然後每天回家看到你和布雷克
And then coming home every day to you and Blake

966
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,540
只會讓我更難受
only made it harder.

967
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,280
因為我知道一切都不一樣了
Because nothin' was the way it used to be.

968
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,420
原來的生活...
And the way it used to be was...

969
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,180
是那麼完美
It was perfect.

970
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,290
我應該多跟你溝通的
I should've let you in.

971
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,530
但我不知道怎麼開口
I just didn't know how.

972
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:51,970
我們的關系變成這樣我很抱歉
I'm so sorry for how things ended with us, em.

973
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:56,370
真的很抱歉
I really am.

974
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,950
如果連你也救不了女兒
If you couldn't save our daughter...

975
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:06,580
那就再也沒有人能救她
Then nobody could have.

976
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,360
我好想她
I miss her so much.

977
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,460
我也是
Me, too.

978
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:28,510
現在我們一起去救女兒
Let's go get our daughter.

979
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,600
往前走  動起來
Let's go! Keep it movin'!

980
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,100
往前走  動起來
Let's go! Come on. Let's go.

981
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,000
沿著疏散路線前進
Follow the evacuation route.

982
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,510
再走幾個街口就到朗伯德大街了
Just a few more blocks to Lombard Avenue,

983
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,310
那堛蔔q科伊特塔
which leads to Coit Tower.

984
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:09,510
我想冒昧地問一句
Do you mind if I ask

985
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:11,950
為什麼你戴著兩條一模一樣的項鏈
why you wear two of the same necklaces?

986
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,620
其中一條是我妹妹的
One of them used to be my sister's.

987
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:23,160
自從她去世後我就開始戴了
I, uh-- I started wearing it after she died.

988
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,560
這是前年聖誕節
We had given them to each other

989
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,400
我們互送對方的禮物
for Christmas the year before.

990
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,900
對不起  我不是故意...
I'm-I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean...

991
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,040
沒關系  我不想刻意回避
No. It's okay. I'm... i'm not hiding them.

992
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,180
你們快看
Hey. Check it out.

993
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,510
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

994
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,880
他們應該會有補給箱
They should have a supply box.

995
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,950
堶悸漯F西應該能派上用場
It'll have stuff that we can use.

996
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:48,990
是這個嗎
Is this it?

997
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:52,290
沒錯
Yes!

998
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:57,030
我們看看
Oh, okay. There we go.

999
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:58,860
每座城市的現場救援人員
Every city has a tactical channel

1000
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,730
都通過火災指揮專用頻道交流
that first responders use to communicate on.

1001
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,730
聽這個頻道就能知道發生了什麼
We can listen in and we can see what's going on.

1002
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:05,130
拿著  裝好
Okay. Here. Take these.

1003
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,300
裝這個
Take this.

1004
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,740
-什麼是軍用口糧  -開袋即食的口糧
- What's an MRE? - Meals ready-to-eat.

1005
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:13,840
它們的保質期長達三年
These things have a shelf life of over three years.

1006
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,380
-厲害  -但不太好吃
- Wow. - They don't taste so good.

1007
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,480
酷
Cool.

1008
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,450
布雷克
Blake!

1009
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,020
看來你要去那個
I think we're going to have a problem

1010
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,350
水管一樣的建築的計劃要出大問題了
with that big nozzle thing you were talking about.

1011
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,920
什麼  你在說什麼
What? What do you mean?

1012
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,730
我的天
Oh, my god.

1013
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,170
我們必須啟動備用計劃了
We have to go to plan B.

1014
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:40,970
我們好像沒有備用計劃
I didn't think we had one.

1015
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,470
現在有了
We do now.

1016
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,480
我們必須再找一個高地
We need to get to the next highest ground

1017
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,810
這樣才能向我爸的直升飛機
so that we can signal my dad

1018
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,610
-發送信號  -那就是諾布山
- ...in the helicopter. - That would be Nob Hill.

1019
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,210
它是市堻怜牧漲a方
It's the highest point in the city.

1020
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:53,080
它在另一個方向
It's the other way.

1021
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,520
快走吧
Okay. Come on!

1022
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,490
布雷克  等一下  等一下
Bl-no. Blake, wait! Wait! Just-- just wait.

1023
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:02,430
請往這邊走  動起來
Coming through. Move, move, move.

1024
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,380
布雷克  只有我們往那邊走
Blake, we'd be the only ones going that way.

1025
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,090
我爸說到高的地方去
My dad said to get to higher ground,

1026
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:31,050
我們照他說的來做
so that's what we gotta do.

1027
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:34,090
可是萬一他來不了呢
But-- what if he doesn't make it?

1028
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:37,430
我知道這有點不可思議
Listen, I know that this sounds crazy.

1029
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:40,830
但你一定要相信我  他會來的
But you have to trust me that he will.

1030
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,670
我  我...
I-- I c--

1031
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,940
本
Ben.

1032
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,810
你知道用按鍵式電話
Did you know about the push-button phone

1033
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,650
接地線來打電話嗎
working with the landline?

1034
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,480
還有找補給箱
The supply box?

1035
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,650
還有火災指揮專用無線電頻道
Tactical radio channels?

1036
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:06,320
我真覺得我們應該聽她的
I really think we should stick with her.

1037
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,570
好吧  我們這就去諾布山
Okay. Looks like we're going to Nob Hill.

1038
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,610
那我們走
Okay. Let's go.

1039
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,080
應加州緊急事務管理署要求
The following message is transmitted at the request

1040
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,880
現廣播以下信息
of the California Emergency Management.

1041
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,690
強烈建議廣大市民即刻開始疏散
Residents are encouraged to evacuate immediately.

1042
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,590
看來他們在疏散整個城市
Looks like the whole city's evacuating.

1043
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,660
飛機場也有麻煩了
And we got a problem at the airport.

1044
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,030
我們要在哪堶偶
Where are we gonna land?

1045
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,930
我們不能降落
We can't.

1046
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,870
至少不能在市堶偶
At least, not in the city.

1047
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,630
跟我來
Come with me.

1048
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:23,130
好吧
Uh... okay.

1049
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,840
你是在搞笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

1050
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,210
飛機找不到可以降落的地方
Em, we have no place to set this plane down

1051
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:34,080
而我們需要離科伊特塔越近越好
and we have to get as close to Coit Tower as we possibly can.

1052
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,380
三分鍾後我們會飛過內河碼頭
In three minutes, we're gonna be over the Embarcadero.

1053
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,610
然後呢
And?

1054
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:41,220
然後我們會降落在AT&T球場
And, we're gonna drop into AT&T Park.

1055
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,520
可我不會跳傘
But I don't know how to parachute.

1056
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,020
沒關系  我們會雙人跳傘
That's okay. We're gonna tandem-jump.

1057
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,020
我  我  我真覺得應該待在飛機上
I-I-I think we should just stay with the plane.

1058
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:48,890
一旦燃料耗盡  飛機就會急速墜落
The plane's gonna nosedive in the Pacific

1059
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,430
一頭紮進太平洋
as soon as it runs out of gas.

1060
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:53,760
好吧
Okay. Mm.

1061
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,740
相信我
Trust me.

1062
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:05,140
我的天
Oh, my god!

1063
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,310
准備好了嗎
You ready?

1064
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:14,350
-我看起來像准備好了嗎  -是
- Do I sound ready?! - Yep!

1065
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:18,580
我們很久沒有上二壘了
It's been a while since I got you to second base.

1066
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,520
勞倫斯·海耶斯博士的嚴重警告
With a grave warning from Dr. Lawrence Hayes

1067
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,020
正通過各大頻道播出
blanketing the airwaves...

1068
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,790
舊金山已啟動疏散程序
San Francisco has begun evacuation procedures.

1069
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:31,290
美國海岸警衛隊請求有船只的個人
The Coast Guard is asking anyone with access to a boat

1070
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:32,900
志願協助疏散...
to please volunteer in the process --

1071
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,400
...加州中央穀地斷層線的地質運動
...fault line in the Central Valley.

1072
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,070
目前舊金山的斷層線尚未移動
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet.

1073
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,900
舊金山將再次出現地震
San Francisco is going to get hit again,

1074
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,240
規模將比這次更大
And this will be a much bigger monster.

1075
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:44,370
希望我對人們發出了足夠的警告
I hope we've given everyone enough warning.

1076
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,210
要來了  是嗎
This is it, isn't it?

1077
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:53,780
我現在多麼希望我是錯的
Right now, I wanna be so wrong.

1078
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,820
大家快找掩護
Everyone, take cover!

1079
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:06,030
這堛漲a震很快會結束
This will be over soon here.

1080
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,330
為舊金山市民祈禱吧
But pray for the people of San Francisco.

1081
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:11,730
你知道"諾布"是一種俚語
Did you know "nob" is a slang term

1082
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:14,900
意思是"有錢"或"富裕"嗎
which means "rich" or "wealthy".

1083
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,310
它也是"貴族"一詞的簡寫
It's a shortened version of the word "nobility",

1084
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:19,410
因為以前的豪門望族在諾布山居住
because of the families that live there.

1085
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:22,310
它被暗諷為"勢利眼山"
It is also derisively known as "snob hill".

1086
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,850
怎麼了
What is it?

1087
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,920
那棟樓是丹尼爾建的
Daniel built that building.

1088
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,390
天啊
Oh, my god.

1089
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,830
我靠
Oh, shit.

1090
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,770
快走  快走
Move! Move!

1091
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:52,240
快  奧利
Come on, Ollie!

1092
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,590
奧利
Ollie!

1093
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:08,260
我想回家
I want to go home now!

1094
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,860
你要堅強
Just hold on!

1095
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,860
沒事的  我發誓
It's gonna be okay. I promise!

1096
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,240
那些人會沒命的
They're gonna get killed out there.

1097
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,180
到球場邊上去
Em, get to the side of the stadium.

1098
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,340
我馬上就來  馬上就來
I'll be right there. I'll be right there!

1099
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,310
這堣ㄕw全  到球場邊上去
It's not safe here. Get to the side of the stadium!

1100
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:04,980
馬上到球場邊上去
Go to the side of the stadium right now!

1101
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:09,050
這棟樓要塌了  快跑
This building's gonna collapse. You need to move!

1102

快  快離開馬路
Hurry! You gotta get off the street!

1103
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,820
到球場邊上去  快
Get to the side of the stadium! Right now!

1104
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:15,420
到球場邊上去  球場邊
Side of the stadium. Get to the side of the stadium!

1105
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,630

快離開馬路

1108
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:32,210
沒事了  有我在

1109
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,610
有我在  起來

- Here. Take her, em. - I got her!

1112
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,930
你會沒事的  會沒事的
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

1113
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,130
沒事的
It's all right.

1114
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,230
大家快趴下
Everybody down!

1115
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:19,220
大家還好嗎  有人受傷嗎

1116
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:20,590
沒有
No.

1117
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:27,430
艾瑪  你沒事吧
Emma. You okay?

1118
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,340
你怎麼知道我們這樣就會安全
How'd you know we'd be safe?

1119
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,560
一定要靠著堅固的東西
Just get up against something sturdy.

1120
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,710
保護好自己
Protect yourself.

1121
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,350
生命三角
Triangle of life.

1122
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,280
走吧
Let's go.

1123
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,450
她一定不會有事的
She's gonna be okay.

1124
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:29,130
但我們要怎麼穿過那片災區
But how do we get through that?

1125
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:40,270
不從那走  我們繞道過去
We don't. We go around it.

1126
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,550
好吧
Oh, okay.

1127
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,450
我們得把玻璃拔出來
We have to get that out of there.

1128
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:57,220
如果你這樣走  會造成更大的傷害
If you try walking with it, it could cause more damage.

1129
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:11,270
會很疼  你准備好了嗎
This is gonna hurt. Are you ready?

1130
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,650
本

我沒事  我沒事

1132
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:34,140
你這條腿還能走路嗎
Do you think you could put some weight on it?

1133
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:34,920
我沒事
I'm all right.

1134
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,590
我們得繼續趕路  我們得爬到那座山上去
We have to keep moving. We gotta get up that hill.

1135
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,730
好吧  來
Okay. Here.

1136
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,180
他們的震級有多高

1137
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:06,090

1139
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,490
不
Oh, no.

1140
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:50,070
火勢已經燒了一段時間了
Coit's been burning a while.

1141
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:51,600
她肯定去別處了
She's gone someplace else.

1142
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,410
你在哪呢  寶貝  你在哪
Now, where are you, baby? Where are you?

1143
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:58,210
你的備選計劃是什麼
What's your Plan B?

1144
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,250
該死
Oh, shit.

1145
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,650
怎麼了
What's happening?

1146
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,720
我們得走了
We gotta go.

1147
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,420
水面像那樣突降就說明海嘯要來了
Water being pulled out like that's a tsunami.

1148
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,430
我們必須馬上離開這個海灣
We gotta get outta the bay, now.

1149
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:27,470
等等  等等  等一下
Wait. Wait, wait a second,

1150
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:29,770
-讓我歇一會  -讓你歇一會
- just give me one second. - Give you a second.

1151
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:32,240
天啊
God!

1152
01:22:34,610 --> 01:22:37,610
天氣部門已經發出對加州北部和中部的
The weather service has issued a tsunami warning

1158
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:59,940
我們得去丹尼爾的大樓

1159
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:15,250
雷

好吧  抓穩了
All right, hold on!

1162
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:25,730
我們要在它到達頂峰前沖過去
We gotta get over it before it crests!

1163
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,780
加油啊  加油啊
Come on! Come on!

1164
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,890
我們會挺過去的  會挺過去的
We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it!

1165
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:34,500

Shit.

1168
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,740
那是什麼聲音
What's that noise?

1169
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,650
我們還不夠高
We're not high enough.

1170
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:10,120
趴下  趴下  找掩護
Get-- get down! Get down! Take cover!

1171

水還在上漲
The water's still rising.

1175
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,090
我們得再往高處爬

天啊
Oh, my God.

1180
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,360
雷  她會在哪
Where is she, Ray?

1181
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,200
她是個聰明的孩子
She's a smart girl.

1182
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,970
她肯定知道要去高處

We just gotta find her.

1184

你沒事吧

我們得處理一下你那條腿

Okay. Ollie, see if there's something

1187
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,890
有什麼可以當繃帶用的東西

1188
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:31,860
再看看能不能找到幹淨水

你真是太令人難以置信了

爸  我好害怕
Daddy, I'm scared.

1244
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,440
我沒氧氣了
I'm running out of air!

1245
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,470
爸  我覺得我堅持不住了
Daddy, I don't think I can do this.

1246
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:27,480
布雷克  你堅持住  堅持住
Blake, you hold on, hold on!

1247
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:38,190
去那邊
There!

1248
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:40,360
本  我不想布雷克死
Ben, I don't want Blake to die.

1249
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,890
她不會死的
She's not going to die.

1250
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:44,430
我回去救她  好嗎
I'm going back for her. Okay?

1251
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:47,360
但我需要你待在這
But I need you to stay here.

1252
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,700
好嗎
Okay?

1253
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,100
好小子
Good boy.

1254
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,350
奧利
Ollie!

1255
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,240
本
Ben!

1256
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:32,640
爬到我背上來  爬到我背上來  奧利
On my back! On my back, Ollie!

1257
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:44,150
布雷克會死的
Blake's going to die.

1258
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,590
對不對
Isn't she?

1259
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:51,660
爸
Dad.

1260
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:52,730
好了
All right.

1261
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:54,130
爸
Dad.

1262
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,630
我愛你  爸
I love you, dad.

1263
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:00,640
請  請你告訴
And please, please tell...

1264
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:03,300
請你告訴媽媽我也愛她
Please tell mom that I love her, too.

1265
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:04,610
布雷克  不許你放棄
Blake, don't you quit on me!

1266
01:38:04,610 --> 01:38:07,910
爸  對不起  爸爸
Daddy. I'm sorry, dad.

1267
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:09,480
布雷克
Blake!

1268
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,090
布雷克
Blake!

1269
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:33,500
不
No!

1270
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,570
布雷克
Blake!

1271
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:30,530
布雷克  布雷克
Blake! Blake!

1272
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:35,160
讓開  奧利  讓開  讓開

1273
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,070
拜托  喘氣  布雷克
Come on. Breathe, Blake.

1274
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:42,640
喘氣  親愛的
Breathe, honey.

1275
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,320
我們得離開這  把窗戶砸開
We gotta get outta here. Break a window!

1276
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,810
天啊
Oh, my God.

1277
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:40,830
讓開  別擋在那
Move! Get outta the way!

1278
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:44,570
小心
Watch out!

1279
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,540
上船  快  快

1280
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,710

- Come on, Ray. - Take her, Emma.

1282
01:40:57,380 --> 01:40:59,880
我接住了  沒事了
I got her. It's okay.

1283
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,150
好了
Here you go.

1284
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:03,650
醒醒  親愛的  拜托
Wake up, honey. Come on.

1285
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:06,690
我抱住她了  帶我們離開這  艾瑪
Get her. Get us outta here, Em!

1286
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:08,760
-好的  -這棟樓要倒了

1287
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,200
大家趴下
Everybody down!

1288
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,300
好了  布雷克
Okay, Blake.

1289
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,940
我和你爸爸  我們都在這
Okay, dad and I, we're right here now.

1290
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:58,810
我們都在
We're right here.

1291
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:01,140
呼吸  布雷克  呼吸
Breathe, Blake. Breathe.

1292
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:02,440
加油啊
Come on.

1293
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:05,350
-別離開我  -呼吸  拜托
- Don't leave me. - Breathe. Come on.

1294
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:07,780
我和爸爸都在你身邊  知道嗎
Dad and I are right here, all right?

1295
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:29,940
雷
Ray...

1296
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:43,120
我的寶貝
My baby.

1297
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:06,210
我不要也失去你
I'm not gonna lose you, too.

1298
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:07,780
不
No.

1299
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:08,840
加油啊
Come on.

1300
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,350
天啊
Oh. Oh, my God.

1301
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,790
好了  好了
Okay. Okay.

1302
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,690
媽媽
Mom.

1303
01:43:23,690 --> 01:43:25,230
我在呢  我在呢
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1304
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,570
沒事了  沒事了  沒事了
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1305
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:54,520
我們現在更清晰地
We are now getting a better picture

1306
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,090
了解到毀壞的程度
of the scale of the devastation.

1307
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:58,290
在很多地方都能看到這樣的景象
And this was the sight in many neighborhoods:

1308
01:43:58,290 --> 01:44:00,700
家人和朋友們相擁在一起
families and friends huddled together,

1309
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,930
驚魂未定卻感激生命還在
shaken but grateful to still be alive.

1310
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:05,100
地震學家們將會密切關注
Seismologists will be keeping a close watch

1311
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,770
全球的所有構造板塊
on all of the world's tectonic plates

1312
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:08,400
因為聖安德烈亞斯地震
as the San Andreas quake

1313
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,070
可能會對全球造成連鎖反應
could have rippling effects throughout the globe.

1314
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:12,940
在國內  隨著地震逐漸平息
Closer to home, nerves are finally calming

1315
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,680
東岸的人們終於可以安心了
on the east coast where the shaking was...

1316
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,380
你幹得很棒
You did good.

1317
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:20,410
謝謝
Thank you.

1318
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:23,450
這是大家的努力
We all did.

1319
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:27,350
舊金山官方向當地專家表示感謝
Authorities in San Francisco are attributing

1320
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:30,730
正因為他向廣大群眾發出了大型地震的警報
a tremendous amount of lives saved thanks to local experts,

1321
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:34,260
大量的生命才得以幸免於難
who were able to give ample warning of the massive quake.

1322
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:45,610
與此同時  灣區的重建工作已經展開
Meanwhile, recovery efforts have begun in the bay area

1323
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:48,680
聯邦應急管理局  國民警衛隊以及聯合國救援隊
where FEMA, the National Guard and U.N. Relief Teams

1324
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,080
都加入了災後重建
have all been mobilized.

1325
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,780
還有成千上萬的志願者
Aided by the thousands of volunteers

1326
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:54,720
也在向加州彙聚
pouring into the state.

1327
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:28,180
奧利  本
Ollie. Ben.

1328
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:32,250
我  我在船上找到這個
I, uh, I found this on the boat.

1329
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:39,990
謝謝
Thank you.

1330
01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:52,570
我想謝謝你們一直陪在布雷克身邊
Hey, I wanna thank you guys for bein' there for Blake.

1331
01:45:52,570 --> 01:45:53,770
謝謝
Yeah, thank you.

1332
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:55,780
不客氣
You're welcome.

1333
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:58,410
但其實更像是她陪在我們身邊
But it was more like she was there for us.

1334
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:01,250
我覺得
I think.

1335
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,760
這太不可思議了
This is incredible.

1336
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,630
那接下來怎麼辦
So... what now?

1337
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:36,320
接下來我們重建
Now we rebuild.

1338
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:13,540
所有的葉子都變成了棕色
All the leaves are brown

1339
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:19,580
而天是灰色的
And the sky is gray

1340
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:24,480
我在冬日
I've been for a walk

1341
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,920
出去散步
On a winter's day

1342
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,890
如果我是在洛杉磯
I'd be safe and warm

1343
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:40,730
現在就會覺得溫暖
If I was in L.A.

1344
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:49,380
在如此一個冬日  做著加州夢
California dreamin', oh, on such a winter's day

1345
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:54,850
所有的葉子都變成了棕色
All the leaves are brown

1346
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:59,120
而天空是灰色的
And the sky is gray

1347
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:03,190
我在冬日
I've been for a walk

1348
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:08,160
出去散步
On a winter's day

1349
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:11,900
要是我在洛杉磯
I'd be safe and warm

1350
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:16,570
現在就會覺得溫暖

1351
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:25,210
在如此一個冬日  做著加州夢
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

1352
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:29,350
我停下來走進一間教堂
I stopped into a church

1353
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:32,920
我走過走道
I passed along the way

1354
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:37,290
我跪下來
Well, I got down on my knees

1355
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:42,200
假裝祈禱
And I pretended to pray

1356
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,000
牧師喜歡寒冷
You know the preacher likes the cold

1357
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,770
他知道我會留下
He knows I'm gonna stay

1358
01:50:50,770 --> 01:51:00,850
在如此一個冬日  做著加州夢
California dreamin', oh, on such a winter's day

1359
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:07,690
我會覺得溫暖
I'd be safe and warm

1360
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:11,130
我會覺得溫暖

1361

我會覺得溫暖

所有的葉子都變成了棕色
All the leaves are brown

1364
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,720
天空是灰色的
And the sky is gray

1365
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:42,360
天空是灰色的
And the sky is gray

1366
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,920
我散了個步
I've been for a walk

1367
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,890
我散了個步

1371
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:54,730
如果我沒去
If I didn't go

1372

我今天就可以離開

我今天就可以離開
I could leave today

1374
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:01,240
加州夢
