
655
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,380
- Hola!
- Hola.

656
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,060
What do you think my father would say...

657
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,620
...if I told him I didn't want to
be a lawyer anymore?

658
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,900
Nothing... He would just kill you.

659
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,260
How is it going with your new
roommate? What's her name?

660
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,380
She's alright, but I'm tired.
- Why?

661
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,860
We spent all weekend looking
for her doctor-boy.

662
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,460
How can a big time heart-guy
leave no trace of himself?

663
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,860
Don't know.

664
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,140
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice.

665
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,820
Where does he work?

666
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,380
I don't know. She said he
used to be at... Loma Vista.

667
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,740
What's his name?

668
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,660
David Ravell.

669
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,180
Loma Vista? David Ravell?

670
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,140
You're talking about the guy
on "A Reason to Love."

719
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:59,980
Tell me. Is your friend still trying
to find that soap opera guy?

720
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,780
Yes. I'd love to find that actor
so he could burst her bubble.

721
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,660
Here is your needle.

722
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,620
He's supposed to make an
appearance here tonight.
