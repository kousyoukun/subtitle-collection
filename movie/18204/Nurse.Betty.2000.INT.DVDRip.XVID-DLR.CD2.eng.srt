1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,908
Well?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,875
What are you waiting for?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,959
Talk to him, huh?
You came 1500 miles for this.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,793
You're serious about this?

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,913
He's got his own company.
I mean, he's the guy you want.

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,439
I want you to meet him.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,519
Yeah, because everyone's
always saying...

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,316
- Do I know you?
- 0f course. Don't you remember?

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,033
I take it I should.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,471
Silly. It's me.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,431
- We were engaged.
- You were engaged?

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,439
I beg your pardon?

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,276
Letting you go, that was
the biggest mistake of my life.

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,199
And it's a mistake I've had
to live with for six years.

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,519
I've put it behind me now, and I just
hope that you can put it behind you too.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,710
I've missed you.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,230
I've missed you, David.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,194
That's... very nice.

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,788
- That was very good.
- I greatly appreciate that.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,438
That was... Wow.

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,869
The day I left you,
I just drove and drove.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,911
I drove all day and all that night.

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,068
I just kept driving. I stopped
at this old country church...

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,112
...and the pastor let me in,
and I sat...

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,312
In the very first pew, where we
would've sat on our wedding day.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,999
I can't believe I remembered that.
Although I should. I wrote it.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,351
But that was seven years ago,
and you're quoting it verbatim.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm... flattered, I think.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,517
0r frightened.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,715
- What's your name?
- Betty Sizemore. What'd you write?

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,593
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the producer.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,992
I have to admit,
you had me going there.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,511
You're better than most of them anyway.
Do you have a head shot?

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,518
Wait a second.
So what happens next, Betty?

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,949
Are you sure you...
Well, why not?

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,991
What... What does happen next, Betty?

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,908
Well, David came out
to do his residency.

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,600
- Then he met Leslie...
- No, no, no.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,679
We know all that. We want to know
what happened to you, Betty.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,358
0h. 0h.

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,839
Well...

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,477
I married a car salesman.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,991
Really?

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,430
You were... you were dumped for
a car salesman, George.

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,358
- Why'd you call him "George"?
- Why did I call him...

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,278
Yeah, David, tell us
about the car salesman.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
0h, right, right.
Well, you're, um...

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,714
You're talkin' about Fred there.

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,753
- Del.
- Del. Del. Yeah.

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,030
Del. He was amazing.

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,355
He was... I mean, this guy...

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,358
Talk about salesmen,
he could sell anything...

53
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,948
...to anybody at any time. Amazing.

54
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,514
- You know Del?
- I don't know how to tell you this...

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,358
...but Del and I go way back.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,595
We went to school together.
As a matter of fact...

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,948
...he saved my life.

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,752
0h, my gosh.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,474
Like, two more minutes
in that freezing-cold water...

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,750
...and I swear to God
I would've drowned, but...

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,193
Del.

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,073
Del jumped in and he grabbed me
and he just...

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
He pulled me out. It was amazing.

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,838
- Pulled him...
- Hold on. I'm having a moment here.

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,476
I lost touch with him after that,
but I still owe him.

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,390
He never said anything.
That is unbelievable.

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,949
- Just what I was thinking.
- I know!

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,551
I can't tell you how much it hurt me
to hear that you married him.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,472
0h, I'm so sorry.

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,398
I tried to tell myself at first
it was for the best...

71
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,913
...that there was some sort
of reason for it. But Del?

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,635
I was young and stupid and scared.

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,469
- You never even gave us a chance.
- I know.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,596
I can't tell you how many times
I tell myself that same thing.

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,514
Are you really crying here?

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,073
- I was kinda playing along.
- What are you doing, George?

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,029
Why does he keep
calling you George?

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,198
I don't know.

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,554
Listen, Betty,
I'm sure you'll understand.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,749
David is a very busy man,
so we really have to go.

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,075
Now.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,070
It was a pleasure meeting you.

83
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,873
We gotta get to this
previous engagement.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,797
But, uh...

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,673
It was good. It was so great.

86
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,993
All right.

87
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,313
I would be honoured
if you'd join us.

88
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,512
What... an idea.

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,473
I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

90
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,198
David.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,558
Yeah?

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,677
All right.

93
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920
- Thank you.
- Hold on a minute.

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,268
Thank you.

95
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,316
- Thanks, man. I love your work.
- Thanks a lot.

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,357
Hey, look who's here!

97
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,756
What's Lonnie doing here?

98
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,077
- What happened to you?
- Late, as usual.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,795
I know. Why are you guys leaving?

100
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,828
- We did our 20 minutes.
- Who's the skirt?

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,360
Somebody who doesn't
like to be referred to as a "skirt".

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,869
- You!
- Miss, what's your name?

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,434
Relax. She didn't even
get you that hard.

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,037
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know just who you are.

105
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,079
This doesn't look like the kind
of place Betty would come to.

106
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,111
Maybe she had
to go to the bathroom.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,390
She does pee, doesn't she?

108
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,875
0r is she too poised to pee?

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,560
Hey. Be careful with that.

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,151
What can I get ya?

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,591
We're federal marshals, ma'am.

112
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,158
We're lookin' for this young lady.

113
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,678
I haven't seen her.

114
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,116
- You sure have!
- Shut up, Merle.

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,993
Betty! Her name is Betty.

116
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,794
I've never seen that woman before and
neither has Merle. He drinks too much.

117
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,753
And don't try to tell me
you're cops.

118
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,953
I was married to a cop for nine years.
You're not cops.

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,635
Motherfuck!

120
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,952
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

121
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,914
You haven't been
forthcoming with us.

122
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,919
So Lyla's very nice.

123
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,793
Really tall.

124
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,638
Yes, she is.

125
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,958
You know, she said she thought
that I was charming and relentless.

126
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,108
She said that I would
go far in this town.

127
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,313
And she said that, unlike most charming
and relentless people she knew...

128
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,271
...she liked me.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,673
Well, she's a good person to know.

130
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,870
So...

131
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,435
...where did you study again?

132
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,033
Carlton.

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,917
Carlton School of Nursing.

134
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,198
But I only went
for two semesters, though.

135
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
- Cos Del...
- Ah, right. 0K, 0K, 0K.

136
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,958
I think you set
the official record...

137
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,073
...for staying in character
about three hours ago now.

138
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,715
You just said that to me
two hours ago.

139
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,157
Is it here?

140
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,879
Well, great.

141
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,112
Gosh. I haven't been
this happy since I was 12.

142
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,510
0K, I'll bite.
What happened when you were 12?

143
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,553
I took my mom to Kansas City
for Mother's Day...

144
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,672
...and I used the allowance
I was saving.

145
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,078
We went to lunch at Skies,
this restaurant at the top of a building...

146
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,591
...and you can see the whole world
from up there.

147
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,189
It was our last special thing...

148
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,317
...cos she died that year.

149
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,717
It was a great day.

150
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,353
You just gave me goose bumps
from that, you know that?

151
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,994
That is just great improv.

152
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,714
I just want everything
to be perfect between us.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,437
I know, I know. Listen, let's, let's...
Time, here. Let's...

154
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,838
Can we talk seriously
for... just a minute?

155
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,670
I know how much you want this, Betty...

156
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,396
...and you are gifted
and extremely determined...

157
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,353
...but I gotta tell you,
it is not entirely up to me.

158
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
I know. It's up to us.

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,952
I love you, David.

160
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,879
And I want to see you
tomorrow and the next day...

161
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,554
...and the next day and the next.

162
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,592
Were you with him this whole time?

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,278
0h, you scared me.

164
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,190
Mm-hmm.

165
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,078
Still in love?

166
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,839
Mm-hmm.

167
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,750
This isn't fair, you know.
Do you always get what you want?

168
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,468
Almost never.

169
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,313
But you're in love with
someone who doesn't exist.

170
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,512
You come out here, you meet this guy
who should laugh in your face.

171
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,313
Instead, you leave with him.

172
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,512
You're, like, one of a kind.

173
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,399
Thanks.

174
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,077
It was a totally rejuvenating,
spiritual experience.

175
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,558
I know. I was there.
I'm not denying that she's good.

176
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,113
Thank you, Lupita.

177
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,711
You know she got a job as a nurse?

178
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,193
Method actress?

179
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,830
David Ravell... He's getting boring.

180
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,194
- We know that.
- Well, couldn't I have a sister...

181
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,039
...who's a twin who's evil?

182
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,119
No! We did that with Lonnie.
Remember the blind one last year?

183
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,038
- He got the Emmy thing for that?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,314
I think we just bring Betty down, throw
her into the set and see what happens.

185
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,348
- I don't know.
- I mean, I tell the cast ahead of time.

186
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,153
- They'd all be prepped.
- I'll think about it.

187
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,989
It'd be like live television.
Let's live on the edge a little bit.

188
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,554
Come on, Lyla!
We could break the mould.

189
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,399
I said I'll think about it.

190
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,034
Let me tell you why I know she's lying.

191
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,633
First place, Betty would
never fall for a soap star.

192
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,030
- It's beneath her.
- That bartender sounded very serious.

193
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,632
No. Betty's here on business. It's
the biggest market for what she's selling.

194
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,955
Wait, hold up.
That don't make no sense.

195
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,594
- What?
- Well, you obviously believe the lady.

196
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,358
Shit, we're all the way here in LA.

197
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,119
So you believed her enough
to come the fuck out here.

198
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,755
If you believed her, now why is the
rest of her story suddenly bullshit?

199
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,518
- I don't buy it.
- Don't buy it.

200
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,837
Call it instinct. Call it 35 years
of professional know-how.

201
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,872
I call it nutty as my shit
after I eat an Almond Roca.

202
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,717
You need to remember
who you're talking to.

203
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,274
I need to get
my fuckin' head examined!

204
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,834
You can't rule something out
just cos you got a whim...

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,638
...or you thought the bitch was fine!

206
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,955
I've been following your whims
across America.

207
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,877
And you know what?
I am fuckin' tired!

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,716
Wesley...

209
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,469
It's beneath her?
The bitch is a fuckin' housewife!

210
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,999
Ain't nothin' beneath her!

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,268
So check this out.
What kind of car does Jasmine drive?

212
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,117
Mercedes, I think. Black.

213
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,549
So is she as fine in real life
as she is on the show?

214
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,400
- Better.
- Goddamn.

215
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,514
Why don't you help a brother
sneak on the lot?

216
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,675
Sure.

217
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,712
- Good lookin' out, baby.
- Go ahead.

218
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,475
Black Mercedes.
Lookin' for a black Mercedes.

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,236
It's got ten kilos.

220
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,193
Blonde, great figure.

221
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
Sort of a wholesome
Doris Day thing going.

222
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,114
Yeah, that's what I said.
Doris Day.

223
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,475
Yeah, you could see her workin'
at the UN or someplace like that.

224
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,757
UN.

225
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,588
United Nations, man. Never mind.

226
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,719
(doorbell)

227
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,591
Hi. Betty there?

228
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,712
You don't look like you do on TV.

229
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,155
You must be Rosa.
I'm George McCord.

230
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,390
I've heard so many
great things about you.

231
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,795
Not as much as
I've heard about you.

232
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,351
These are for you.

233
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,798
Hi.

234
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,834
0h, that's nice.

235
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,475
- Well, I see you've met David.
- Yeah, I sure did.

236
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,797
Funny thing, Betty.
He introduced himself to me as George.

237
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,832
0h, yeah. He does that.

238
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,396
Half the people who know him
call him George.

239
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,993
I don't think your friend Rosa
likes me very much.

240
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,793
0h, she's probably just jealous.

241
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,040
She gets a little confused about men.
So where are we going?

242
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,789
First I was thinking about Patina,
and then I thought about the Ivy...

243
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,550
...and then I thought someplace
a little more romantic, like my place.

244
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,831
0h, great!
We're going to the beach house.

245
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,635
No. I don't live
at the beach. David...

246
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,116
No, I moved to the hills.
I moved.

247
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,237
God, I haven't felt like this since
I was with Stella Adler in New York.

248
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,309
You just... You're...
You're so real.

249
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,116
I don't think you've ever mentioned
this Stella to me before.

250
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,276
0h, haven't I?

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,833
See, I would remember
the name Stella.

252
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,873
The only Stella I ever knew
was a parrot.

253
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,515
So was that before Leslie?
Before us?

254
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,270
I've never met
anyone like you, Betty.

255
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,036
Well, that's why we're
meant to be together.

256
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,439
Your dedication scares me.

257
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,838
0h, it's easy to be dedicated
when you care about something.

258
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,038
When I met you,
it was like a warm breeze...

259
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,118
...had suddenly blown into my life.

260
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,716
You remember that line? I said that
to Leslie during her funeral.

261
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,154
I love that line.

262
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,914
Well...

263
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,874
...you said it to her...

264
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,396
...but you meant it for me,
didn't you?

265
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,833
Yeah.

266
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,876
Maybe I did.

267
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,511
So I'm on Hollywood Boulevard,
checking out the stars on the ground.

268
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,438
Clint Eastwood, Rock Hudson.
No people of race. Not one.

269
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,189
I could not find people of race anywhere.
So I'm looking at this Chinese guy.

270
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,914
He's reading his paper, I look
real hard, and who do I see?

271
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,110
That's Lonnie,
the main prick from the show.

272
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,470
And who is that next to him? Betty!

273
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,160
I told you this
ain't no coincidence.

274
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,153
You been holding out on me?

275
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,714
- This does not fit her profile.
- Fuck the profile!

276
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,071
- That's the same guy!
- No, no. No, no, no.

277
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,397
Betty would not be here because of
a soap opera. Not a soap opera, man!

278
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,795
- That would make her...
- That would make her crazy!

279
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,912
No shit, Shaft! And you ain't
too far behind yourself.

280
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,075
No, no...

281
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,590
How the fuck did you stay on
this job so fuckin' long?

282
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,029
We are draggin' our ass
up and down the country.

283
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,630
And our answer to our prayers
are right in your back fuckin' pocket.

284
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,433
You let this cunt fuck up my...

285
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,190
Don't you talk to Betty that way.

286
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,912
I don't care what
she turns out to be.

287
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,110
Don't you use that term again.
You hear me?

288
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,634
- You need therapy.
- Do you understand?

289
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,038
Yes, I understand! Now let go
of my vest. You're stretching it.

290
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,635
You made your point.

291
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,158
- Get yourself ready.
- Get ready?

292
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,590
Shit, I've been ready
since 0klahoma. "Get ready."

293
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,228
Ready for what?

294
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,073
- No peeking, all right?
- How much longer?

295
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,679
Not much.

296
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,550
There's nothing in front of you.
Relax.

297
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,229
You got a little step there.
You're fine, you're fine.

298
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,271
All right. You all set?

299
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,550
Here we go. And...

300
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,793
Surprise.

301
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,719
Loma Vista.

302
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,188
Ta-da!

303
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,198
You didn't tell me I was
gonna meet your friends.

304
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,153
Guess what. You got the job.

305
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,919
- And I'm directing.
- 0h, but I'm at LA County.

306
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,837
0h, are you? Come on.

307
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,428
It's only four lines, so I thought
I'd spring it on you.

308
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,074
Hope that's 0K. We won't do
any blocking or anything.

309
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,668
I'm just gonna put you here
near the nurse's station...

310
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,518
0K, I'll be right there.
0K? Thanks.

311
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,029
I just wanna do a quick
run-through, all right?

312
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,197
Relax. You look great.
And here we go in a sec. Hold on.

313
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,156
Traffic was a nightmare
coming over the hill.

314
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,991
That's fine. We've only got... 70 pages
to shoot today. Take your time.

315
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,348
David!

316
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,389
We'll get you into hair and
makeup after this.

317
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,397
What are you doing?

318
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,915
Hi. Welcome.
I hear you're really good.

319
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,349
- What are you doing here?
- Good luck.

320
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,633
David!

321
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,479
- Your lines are on the cue cards.
- What is she doing here?

322
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,750
0h. But feel free to ad-lib, 0K?

323
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,314
- Ad-lib?
- In fact, I want you to ad-lib.

324
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,510
That's the magic that I'm after.

325
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,471
You know, just let it go,
have fun with it.

326
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,068
We're gonna have a whole new feel
to the show. Eric!

327
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,156
You know?
So just do one of those... Just...

328
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,829
You know, let it out and just have
fun with it. You remember Betty?

329
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,632
- Yes.
- Let's go.

330
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,832
Settle, please.
Stand by. Rehearsal.

331
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,273
Betty...

332
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,756
Just do what
you've been doing, 0K?

333
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,189
Watch the scene.
Take your cue from here.

334
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,914
Hank. Lines are over here.

335
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,591
Here we go. In...

336
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,035
...five, four...

337
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,152
...three, two...

338
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,509
Is this some kind of a game?

339
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,790
No, it's more like a nightmare
I can't wake up from.

340
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,230
There are other people in this nightmare.
They're going to get hurt.

341
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,476
I feel so... Arm, please.

342
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,079
0h.

343
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,034
- I feel so alone right now.
- Here we go. Show time.

344
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,638
- Are you all right?
- I think you stepped on my first line...

345
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,716
I was talking to her.
Do you need anything?

346
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,391
I'm sorry. I thought
this would be the best way.

347
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,557
- Just kind of throw you into it.
- (Lyla) What the hell's going on?

348
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,309
- If you need a minute...
- Can I talk to you?

349
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,353
- If you wanna just...
- Can I talk to you? Just a second.

350
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,679
- David...
- Stop calling me David, for Christ's sake.

351
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,711
We're on the set.
You don't have to call me David.

352
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,469
- What's going on?
- What is going on what?

353
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,875
You're acting crazy here.

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,798
- Isn't this exactly what you wanted?
- I don't know.

355
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,156
- Is there a problem, George?
- No, no, no.

356
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,477
No problem. There's...

357
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,195
What is the problem?
Just do that thing that you do.

358
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,710
I mean, come on! You drove me
nuts with this for three days.

359
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,229
Now, just relax, and let's do it.

360
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,194
Here we go. You're fine.
You'll be fine. Sorry about that.

361
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,029
- All right? Here we go.
- In five, four...

362
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,878
...three, two...

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,479
Is this some kind of game
you're playing?

364
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,636
No, it's more like a nightmare
I can't wake up from.

365
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,990
There are other people
in that nightmare...

366
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,913
...and they're going to get hurt.

367
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,430
0h, no. 0h, no. 0h, no.

368
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,599
Betty?

369
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,835
(George) 0h, no.

370
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,278
(voices echoing)

371
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,237
This is bullshit!
I cannot work like this!

372
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,795
- All right, everybody, take five.
- Hold on, hold on.

373
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,673
- Let me just talk to her.
- It was a gamble. It didn't work.

374
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,234
- We have to move on.
- She's been doing this all week!

375
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,197
- She can do it now!
- I said forget it!

376
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,115
All right. Well...
What are you looking at, Eric?

377
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,710
I hope you're happy. I just put
my ass on the line for you...

378
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,673
...and my reputation, and you just made
a total idiot out of me.

379
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,631
- You happy?
- I'm sorry. What did I do?

380
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,195
Who put you up to this?
Did my ex-wife do this?

381
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,312
- David...
- Stop calling me that!

382
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,870
My name is George! George! Say it!

383
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,270
This is a TV show!
A television show!

384
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,960
If you don't know the difference,
you're more fucked up than I thought!

385
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,072
- Leave her alone, George.
- Shut the fuck up! You're a grip. Go...

386
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,633
...grip something!

387
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,069
And you are not an actress, are you?
You're...

388
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,509
You're like
a soap opera groupie, right?

389
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,992
Is that it? You have nothing
better to do but this!

390
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,039
Why don't you get a fuckin' life
and stop ruining mine!

391
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,037
- 0h, boy.
- She gave me this one shot...

392
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,198
...one shot in my life to do this,
and you have destroyed it.

393
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,794
Thank you very much!
Thanks, Betty! That was great!

394
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,878
Are you hearing this?
Hey!

395
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,314
She's fuckin' crazy! Don't look at me
like that! You... Tell 'em who I... Hey!

396
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,194
Tell 'em who I am. Tell 'em.

397
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,510
George McCord?

398
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,392
No, no, no. No, not now.

399
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,351
I'm David. I am Dr David Ravell.

400
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,277
I'm the great
Dr David Ravell, right?

401
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,755
Loma Vista's greatest...
I'm the doctor!

402
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,440
I don't think that. She thinks that!
Who did you call me?

403
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,670
She called you George, George.

404
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,718
George McCord, my favourite actor?

405
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,598
0h, oh. 0h, God.

406
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,111
- What are you doing here?
- 0h... 0h, you're sick.

407
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,750
What do you do now?
Are you gonna kill me?

408
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,270
No! Don't get near me!
Don't touch anything, crazy person!

409
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,311
What do you do now? What?

410
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,197
I'm gonna go.

411
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,758
0K. Moving on. Wardrobe?

412
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,957
How do you do, Mr McCord?

413
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,390
We're trying to locate a deranged
fan of yours, a Miss Betty...

414
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,717
Deranged. Yeah.
That'd be the right word for it.

415
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,515
That's not necessary.
She's staying with a friend of hers...

416
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,395
...Rosa Herreras or Hernandez or...

417
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,479
Has an "H" sound to it.
They're in Silverlake.

418
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,591
- That's all I know.
- Silverlake.

419
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,836
You must get this a lot.

420
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,149
Mm-hm.

421
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,679
More than you know.

422
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,751
- Anything else?
- No.

423
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,677
Actually, there is.

424
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,788
I'm a big fan of the show, and I figure
you being Dr Ravell and all...

425
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,595
...I thought you might be able to go out
there and tell Jasmine to come outside.

426
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,030
- Well, you thought wrong.
- It's an autograph. It's not for me.

427
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,912
- It never is.
- Motherfucker!

428
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,996
You need to have
some fuckin' manners, man!

429
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,192
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
Hey, I saw your TV movie!

430
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,630
It sucked!
Hasselhoff blew you off the screen!

431
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,078
Betty?

432
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,798
Did the pizza guy show up yet?

433
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,996
- Can I have these chips?
- Sure.

434
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,838
Thanks.

435
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,996
(Rosa) Are you all right?

436
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,078
Did something happen?

437
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,559
0h, shit! What the...

438
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,870
Call a doctor, bitch.

439
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,315
- What the hell is that?
- Don't ask.

440
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,518
It's all there.
Hasn't been touched.

441
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,428
You were right about Del.
He wasn't lying.

442
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,917
Yeah, well, you were right about
what the lady bartender said.

443
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,919
Yeah, but you were right first.
You gotta follow your instincts.

444
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,037
What do your instincts
tell you now?

445
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,351
Take this shit back to Detroit
and get our fuckin' money.

446
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,071
We could do that.
I could be on my way to Florida.

447
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,749
You could go on down to Thailand or
someplace and fuck your brains out.

448
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,679
- That's not what we're gonna do, is it?
- No.

449
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,274
She's my last one.

450
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,075
My instincts are telling me
I've got to see this through with her.

451
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,872
If there's anything
I've tried to teach you...

452
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,198
- It's to follow my instincts.
- No. It's to follow my instincts.

453
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,312
So we go up there
and we conclude our business.

454
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,589
Case closed.

455
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,791
I have to leave.

456
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,916
- Leave? Where you going?
- Kansas.

457
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,917
- Tonight?
- Uh-huh.

458
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,439
You're gonna drive halfway
across the country this minute?

459
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,916
Uh-huh. I have to go fix
what happened to my husband.

460
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,549
- So now you have a husband.
- Had.

461
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,513
He was killed in the dining room.

462
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,753
- Huh?
- I think I saw the whole thing.

463
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,872
I remember blood everywhere
and everything.

464
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,748
So what are you saying, Betty, huh? Huh?

465
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,750
I really don't know.

466
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,915
(doorbell)

467
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,397
Yeah, just a minute! This is crazy,
Betty, 0K? Just don't go.

468
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,715
Just stay here,
and I'll be right back.

469
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,957
- How much?
- Uh, Detective Jefferson.

470
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,719
0h. Did Betty call you?

471
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,714
She's got problems,
but... she's no killer.

472
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,718
I hope you can straighten this out.

473
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,955
Go easy on her, 0K?
Cos she's had a really rough day.

474
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,629
- Hey, Rosa?
- These guys are here to help you, Betty.

475
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,511
- I don't think so.
- Come on! Come here!

476
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,915
Get the fuck over there!
Come on!

477
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,156
Sit down! Shut up!

478
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,798
So, we meet again.

479
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,879
I've spent many long hours in the car
with your face staring back at me.

480
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,198
- I've seen it painted on the horizon.
- What's wrong with you?

481
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,877
Huh?

482
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,433
(doorbell)

483
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,039
- That's our pizza.
- Wesley...

484
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,473
- Come here, come here.
- Get rid of 'em. You understand?

485
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,953
0K.

486
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,196
Hi.

487
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,595
Betty. Boy, am I glad to see you!

488
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,352
- Roy, what are you doing here?
- You are in serious danger.

489
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,869
0h? Well, Roy, it's really
not a good time right now.

490
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,709
Betty, I would've been here sooner,
but Elden put me in jail.

491
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,035
He still thinks that
you had Del scalped.

492
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,549
Hey, I never said that, 0K?

493
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,750
Hi, Sheriff. I don't think...

494
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,792
Betty, look, open up.
I gotta ask you some questions...

495
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,992
Betty, I really think it's important
to find out...

496
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,759
It's just really, really not a great time.

497
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,597
Hey!

498
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,908
Hey!

499
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,953
Don't give me that!
I've come 2,000 miles for this!

500
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,508
Ah!

501
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,233
You probably flew. Come on.

502
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,153
I crossed the River Styx
to find her, pal.

503
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,192
I travelled the fuckin' country
to get here.

504
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,676
- Who are these idiots?
- That's Roy 0strey. He's a reporter.

505
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,155
And that's Sheriff Ballard. He, uh...

506
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,669
Well, we went to Fair 0aks High.

507
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,552
0h, great. This is great.

508
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,518
Sit your ass down!
What's up? Come here.

509
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,598
Come here, motherfucker!
Come here!

510
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,711
You need an invitation?

511
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,196
- I got two kids and a dog.
- Yeah. Who don't?

512
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,195
What, what, you gonna shoot me?

513
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,833
What you gonna do?

514
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,712
(handcuffs)

515
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,908
What you doin'? Act professional!

516
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,555
- That's not professional!
- Don't worry about me.

517
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,238
Find out what they know.

518
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,319
Shit.

519
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,113
0hh.

520
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,718
0h, 0K.

521
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,193
0K. 0K.

522
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,359
0K!

523
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,357
Um... um, um...

524
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,833
I suppose you want me, um...

525
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,232
What?

526
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,709
To take off my...

527
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,956
0h, no. No.

528
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,231
- No?
- You know who I am?

529
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,268
- 0h, I've got a pretty good idea.
- Listen.

530
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,237
You didn't have anything to do with
what Del was into, did you, Betty?

531
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,989
I have no idea what
Del was mixed up in.

532
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,590
So... you had nothing
to do with the drugs.

533
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,838
0h, my God. Drugs? God, no!

534
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,870
I am totally against drugs.

535
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,113
Life is very strange.

536
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,109
I really had you pegged
as a cold-blooded bitch.

537
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,471
I mean, not that I didn't
still admire you for it.

538
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,317
If you didn't come here
to kill me, then...

539
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,954
...why are you here?

540
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,797
To see ya.

541
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,356
Now how'd you two
dumb fucks find Betty?

542
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,357
I just put it all together.

543
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,669
I knew that David, Lonnie and Chloe
were from that show.

544
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,910
Betty thinks they're real people.

545
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,112
Sounded strange,
but it was worth a shot.

546
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,437
- What do you want?
- Ignore him.

547
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,750
Don't take that tape off.
You'll regret it.

548
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,474
- You're such a liar, Elden Ballard!
- 0h, shut up!

549
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,068
Liar! I'm the one that
figured it out, not him!

550
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,679
- Shut up!
- You are really smart!

551
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,199
- Fuck you, Roy 0strey.
- Shut up!

552
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,675
- I'm the one that watched the...
- Shut the fuck up!

553
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,109
Shut the fuck up both of you
before I kill both of you!

554
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,629
- You watch the show?
- Yeah, I watch the show!

555
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,591
He's the one that didn't,
cos he's a liar!

556
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,837
Calm down!
Stop acting like a little bitch.

557
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,270
- Now, did Chloe crack?
- Chloe fell completely apart!

558
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,119
- You didn't know Chloe cracked, did you?
- (Wesley screams)

559
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,871
- What about Jasmine?
- Jasmine's a lesbian.

560
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,992
Lyin' motherfucker! You lie!
Jasmine is not a lesbian!

561
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,270
I know what I'm talking about!

562
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,154
What you want? You scream, you die.
I'm gonna take this shit off.

563
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,032
You scream, you fuckin' die!

564
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,557
I have a tape of today's show.

565
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,154
(Jasmine) You've got a lot of men
in motion over what you did.

566
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,555
- What I did?
- Don't give me that, Chloe.

567
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,229
- What about what he did?
- I wasn't born yesterday.

568
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,796
You get in a man's car,
there's a reason. We both know that.

569
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,988
- Do you think that maybe...
- No, no. They're fine. They're fine.

570
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,155
I don't meet people like you.

571
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,549
I'm a garbageman of the human condition.
I deal with trash.

572
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,591
People who'd trade any part of themselves

573
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,234
for a few more minutes
of their rotten lives.

574
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,352
- But you're different.
- I am?

575
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,632
Yeah. You could probably
have anything you want.

576
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,228
Somebody as beautiful
and as stylish as you are...

577
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,920
...and you don't even realise it.

578
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,838
I just don't think
I'm who you think I am.

579
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,394
Look, let me just get this out.

580
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,798
I like walks in the rain
and sunsets and symphonies...

581
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,111
...kids, animals.

582
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,034
I read passionately.
I like to discuss things.

583
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,038
I guess, basically,
I'm conservative...

584
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,037
...but flexible.

585
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,475
I followed you all the way
across the country, you know...

586
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,229
...and I've come to feel that...

587
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,272
...we're a lot more alike
than you think.

588
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,558
But I thought you said that you
were the garbageman of humanity.

589
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,553
I just...

590
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,398
...hoped I could leave that behind me.

591
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,829
I thought "no" meant no.

592
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,831
(Chloe) What?

593
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,190
Say something.

594
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,756
First of all,
don't insult my intelligence...

595
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,872
...by telling me that David Ravell
attacked you in that car.

596
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,398
So, um, that Jasmine, she certainly
is intriguing, isn't she?

597
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,830
Jasmine ain't no dyke.
She's just tryin' to find herself.

598
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,549
- You're my only friend.
- Look at the titties on Jasmine.

599
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,955
(Wesley) Goddamn!
Ah, suki, suki, now.

600
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,039
Look at that! You can do
that shit on TV? 0h, shit!

601
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,071
Look at that shit!

602
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,396
- Jasmine is a wildcat.
- You would never cook up this scheme.

603
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,560
What the... 0h, shit!

604
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,038
Wesley! Get over there.

605
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,308
Daddy!

606
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,473
Wesley?

607
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,516
- 0h, my God! My fish are out there!
- I know. They're nishiki goi.

608
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,200
- How'd you know that?
- We're in a shootout here!

609
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,958
You wanna shut up about the damn fish?

610
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,832
No, Elden! You shut up!

611
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,277
I'll get your fish.

612
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,438
Roy.

613
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,831
- 0h, Christ.
- What?

614
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,795
They shot my boy.

615
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,236
My son is dead.

616
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,269
Sorry.

617
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,354
You're the reason I'm here.
That's right. I'm here because of you.

618
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,519
Shit.

619
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,317
I need my other gun. Go check his jacket.
Give me the gun. I'll cover you.

620
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,715
- Let's wait for the real police.
- I am the real police!

621
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,358
- Why can't we sneak outside?
- You don't just run away from crime.

622
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,471
And Betty's in there.

623
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,519
So all of this really is
because of a soap opera.

624
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,590
My son is dead because...

625
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,315
...you wanted to be with this doctor.

626
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,395
This fake doctor.

627
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,592
(sirens)

628
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,480
Well, too late anyway.

629
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,194
You could at least give me my gun.

630
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,915
Maybe I could shoot my way out,
take a couple of them with me.

631
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,718
- I think I'd rather not.
- Betty, please. Please.

632
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,595
I don't wanna shrivel up alone
in some stinkin' prison. No way.

633
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,439
I've got my professional pride.

634
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,549
And...

635
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,558
I don't want somebody else
to get credit for taking me out.

636
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,954
I want you to listen to me.

637
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,638
Betty...

638
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,433
You never needed that actor.

639
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,869
You don't need that doctor.

640
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,038
You don't need any man.

641
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,870
It's not the '40s, you know.

642
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,630
Honey, you don't need anybody.

643
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,633
You know why?

644
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,593
Cos you've got yourself.

645
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,198
(gunshot)

646
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,639
In a story that police say
is bizarre even for Hollywood...

647
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,193
...a father-son team of killers...

648
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,516
...tracked a Kansas soap opera fan...

649
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,155
...halfway across the country,
only to find themselves the victims...

650
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,635
...in a final, bloody confrontation.

651
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,513
- We go now to Bebe Burke at...
- That's our Betty.

652
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,837
This story is beyond belief,
which is perfect for us.

653
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,474
It's free advertising.
It's gonna run for months.

654
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,631
I don't think she can do it.

655
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,435
I really don't. Are you serious?
Did you see what happened?

656
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,916
Well, who wouldn't freeze
under those circumstances?

657
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,998
And she wouldn't be the first
in the cast with problems.

658
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,032
That's why we have nothing to lose
by sending you to talk to her.

659
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,994
Me? 0K. Let's talk about me.

660
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,079
- What about my feelings about this?
- I don't care about your feelings.

661
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,073
I did like your icy water idea
the other day, though.

662
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,758
Yeah?

663
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,629
I'm toying with the idea
of killing David Ravell off...

664
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,478
...in a boating accident.

665
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,559
0ne of those castaway deals
with Chloe and...

666
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,148
No? How do I come back?

667
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,833
No, no, no. Don't try the blackmail
bullshit with me, Lyla.

668
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,679
It's beneath you,
so don't even think about it.

669
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,554
It's an emphatic no, missy.
End of story right there.

670
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,869
I'm sorry for what I did.

671
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,672
I'm sorry for the things
that I said, and...

672
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,793
...for not respecting you...

673
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,879
...and just all the stupid
little things that I was...

674
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,231
- When you have a minute.
- I don't like the idea of autographs...

675
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,669
...and I'm kind of in a moment
right here, so...

676
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,438
It's the check.

677
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,790
Sorry about that.

678
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,076
Uh... No, no. I got this.

679
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,031
My treat.

680
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,355
It's not the '40s, you know.

681
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,873
0K.

682
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,593
You know that my
best friend once said...

683
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,678
...that if you were any handsomer
it'd be a crime?

684
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,389
Thank you.

685
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,359
It's just too bad
that you're such an asshole.

686
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,317
That's 0K.
You know what? That's 0K.

687
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,876
That's all right. I'm 0K with that.
That's fair enough.

688
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,918
Now we've settled
the whole asshole thing...

689
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,239
...is there any chance that you would
think about joining the show?

690
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,073
At all?

691
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,795
There's always a chance, David.

692
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,117
But what about tomorrow
and the next day, and the next day...

693
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,229
...and the next?

694
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,796
If you were any handsomer,
Doctor...

695
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,672
...it'd be a crime.

696
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,750
I take it that means
you're free tomorrow.

697
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,594
I was going to ask you that too.

698
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,518
It's as if I've been in
some sort of dream state.

699
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,874
Like... Like you didn't know who
you were or what you were doing?

700
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,553
Yes.

701
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,635
I have that effect on people.

702
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,752
Well, you certainly
had that effect on me.

703
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,558
C'e sempre una possibilita, David.

704
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,078
Ma tu ci sarai domani, e domani,
e domani ancora.

705
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,673
Dottore, piu bello di cos si muore.

706
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,759
Credo di capire che sei libera stasera.

707
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,434
Io ti amo, David.

708
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,710
Ti amo.

709
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,478
Excuse me, sir?

710
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,793
Sir?

711
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,355
Betty Sizemore appeared in 63 episodes
of A Reason to Love.

712
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,631
She is using her earnings
to pay for a nursing degree...

713
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,911
...and is currently on vacation
in Europe. The Europe.

714
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,833
(woman sings "Que Sera, Sera" in Italian)
