00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:42,128
Did Chloe testify?

457
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,832
She's been working here
how long?

458
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:48,234
Five years, give or take.

459
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:50,803
- You two in high school
together?
- [ Laughs ]

460
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:54,440
Aren't you a sweetheart.

461
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:57,010
No, not quite.

462
00:29:57,043 --> 00:30:01,247
Anyway, she's been with us
quite a while.

463
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,449
- But she wanted more
out of life, huh?
- No, she just wanted...

464
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:06,119
something out of life--
anything.

465
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:09,322
- Who is this gentleman?
- That's just a cutout.

466
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:12,558
- That's a gag we did
for her birthday.
- Do you mind if I keep these?

467
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:14,961
If it'll help bring her back,
please be my guest.

468
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:45,325
I hope you didn't
get the wrong idea
on the phone, Lonnie.

469
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:47,928
Oh, I don't think so,
Chloe.

470
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,302
But when they call Chloe
Jensen to the stand, just say
what you're supposed to say.

471
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:59,639
You mean I'm going
to have to swear?
On a Bible?

472
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,942
Relax.
It's a hearing.

473
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,144
But they are gonna
ask you some questions.

474
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:06,046
Oh, no!
So--

475
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,181
You're into Reason  too?

476
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:11,151
- [ Chloe ]
Is David gonna be there?
- I'm Ellen.

477
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:14,420
- What can I get you?
- A lite beer, please.

478
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:16,522
Come on, Chloe.

479
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:21,594
You're a beautiful,
intelligent, sexy woman.
Thank you.

480
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:25,098
With a torn blouse.
You can't lose.

481
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:28,334
- [ Together ] Ooh.
- A Reason to Love
will continue.

482
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:30,536
[ Betty ]
Ellen, do you have
a phone?

483
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,306
Here you go.

484
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:35,508
If it's long distance,
you can leave me a buck
when you're done.

485
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,177
Thanks.

486
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,150
[ Ringing ]
Hello?

487
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:46,386
Sue Ann.
Betty!

488
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,255
Hi. Just calling
to tell you that I'm fine.

489
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:51,424
Okay, where are you?
I'm in the...

490
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:54,527
Canyon Ranch Bar,
in, um--

491
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,130
Williams.
In Williams, Arizona.

492
00:31:57,163 --> 00:32:00,366
So I guess
I'm halfway there.
Halfway to where?

493
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,636
You've got to come home.
We've been really worried
about you, you know.

494
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:06,506
Sue Ann, I thought
you'd back me on this.

495
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,109
You know how it is
with Del.

496
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:11,511
How did he take my note?
Listen to me.

497
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:15,581
A nice man came by
from Mutual Life Insurance.

498
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:19,986
He says you've got
a lot of money coming
to you from Del's policy.

499
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,689
- What are you talking about?
- Del's life insurance policy.
Are you with me?

500
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:27,027
- Oh-- I've gotta go.
- No. Betty, listen to me.

501
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,629
Del is dead.
What did I ever do
to her?

502
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:32,198
It's what
you didn't do, bud.

503
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,006
[ Ellen ]
So where you headed,
Betty?

504
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,142
[ Betty ]
Los Angeles, California.

505
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:45,578
And you called your friend,
and she's telling you
not to go?

506
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:50,783
When I went to Europe,
my friends told me
I was crazy.

507
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:53,286
Europe? The  Europe?

508
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,522
God, this is my first time
out of Kansas.

509
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:59,059
I should call you
Dorothy.

510
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:04,364
When I first left here,
I went straight
to Italy.

511
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:08,168
Everyone told me not to go,
but, oh, I wanted to go
to Rome--

512
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:11,737
ever since
I saw Audrey Hepburn
in Roman Holiday.

513
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:15,108
[ Laughs ]
And goddamn it, I went!

514
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,043
Did you love it?

515
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:20,613
Rome was the best thing
I ever did--

516
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:22,648
because I did it.

517
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:26,219
I swear to you,
it changed me.

518
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:30,256
I've been to Rome, Italy.

519
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,292
And I sat every morning
in the Café Sistina,

520
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:35,628
and I drank my cappuccino
and I--

521
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,199
I watched the pilgrims
walk to Mass.

522
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:43,769
No one can ever
take that away from me.

523
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,805
[ Laughs ]

524
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:54,314
I left my husband
three days ago.

525
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:57,817
Really?
Yeah.

526
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:02,322
I'm getting back
with my ex-fiancé.

527
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:04,424
He proposed to me
right around here,

528
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:07,059
so I guess this is
kind of a sentimental stop.

529

Well, I mean except for then.

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,752
I suppose his name
is David Ravell.

00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:09,255
How did you know that?

547
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:11,324
What's his real name?

548
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:14,494
It's Dr. David Ravell.
But how did you know?

00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:17,597
Do you mean George McCord,

No. No, no, no.
David Ravell.

find him, Betty?

Well, I'll--
I'll go to the hospital.

To tell you the truth,

I can't believe
I've made it this far.

- Yeah, she called me

That's Betty when she was 12.

Thank you, ma'am.

00:37:56,689 --> 00:38:00,393
Now, did she ever give you
any indication that she
might leave her husband?

589
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:03,763
She put up with things
that I wouldn't have.

And yet she,
of all people,
defended him.

591
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:13,406
That's why
what that Sheriff said
made me angry.

- What do you mean?
- If anyone paid to have...

it would have been me.

Well, Mr. and Mrs. Blaine,
I can assure you,
without a doubt,

that your granddaughter
is alive,

596
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:29,655
and she had absolutely
nothing to do with
the killing of Del Sizemore.

597
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:32,358
You've got to be missing
a piece of your soul
to kill someone.

That's not our Betty.

599
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:37,997
Why do you say you've got to
be missing a piece of your
soul to kill somebody?

600
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,466
Because it's not natural,
young man.

601
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,135
It's very,
very natural to kill.
All species kill.

602
00:38:43,168 --> 00:38:45,971
See, God kills.

603

You saying that God's
missing a piece
of His soul?

My partner is young,

He loves his job.
Loves his job.

00:59:55,273 --> 00:59:57,909
I'm Lyla Branch.
I'm the producer.

913
00:59:57,942 --> 01:00:01,212
Uh-huh.
I have to admit,
you had me going there.

914
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:04,348
[ Laughing ]
You're better than
most of them anyway.

915
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:06,651
Yeah.
Do you have
a head shot?

916
01:00:06,685 --> 01:00:09,320
Wait a second.
So what happens next,
Betty?

917
01:00:09,353 --> 01:00:11,956
Are you sure you--
Well, why not?

918
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,693
What-- What does
happen next, Betty?

919
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:18,663
Well, David came out to,
uh, do his residency,

920
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:20,965
and then he met Leslie--
No, no, no, no, no.

921
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:24,769
We know all that.
We want to know
what happened to you, Betty.

922
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:29,207
Oh. Oh. Well--

923
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:33,211
I married a car salesman.

924
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:35,814
[ Laughs ]
Really?

925
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:39,984
You were--
You were dumped for
a car salesman, George.

926
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:42,787
- Why'd you call him
"George"?
- Why did I call him--

927
01:00:42,821 --> 01:00:45,724
Yeah, David, tell us
about the car salesman.

928
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:49,393
Oh, right, right.
Well, you're, um--

929
01:00:49,427 --> 01:00:53,297
You're talkin' about,
uh, Fred there.

930

Del.
Del. Del. Yeah.

931
01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:58,169
Uh, Del.
He was amazing.

932
01:00:58,202 --> 01:01:01,005
Oh, yeah.
He was, I mean,
this guy--

933
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:05,744
Talk about salesmen,
he could sell anything
to anybody...

934
01:01:05,777 --> 01:01:08,479
at anytime, amazing.
You know Del?

935
01:01:08,512 --> 01:01:11,850
I don't know
how to tell you this,
but Del and I go way back.

936
01:01:11,883 --> 01:01:14,819
We went to school together.
As a matter of fact,

937
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:18,189
he saved my life.

938
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:22,360
- Oh, my gosh.
- Like, two more minutes
in that freezing-cold water,

939
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:25,730
and I swear to God,
I would've drowned, but--

- Del.
- [ Laughs ]

941
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,306
Del jumped in and he
grabbed me and he just--
he pulled me out.

942
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:37,408
- [ Laughs ]
- It was amazing.

943
01:01:37,441 --> 01:01:41,212
Pulled him--
Hold on. I'm having
a moment here.

944
01:01:41,245 --> 01:01:46,250
I lost touch with him
after that, but...
I still owe him.

945
01:01:46,284 --> 01:01:51,522
He never said anything.
God. That is unbelievable.

946
01:01:51,555 --> 01:01:53,424
That's funny.
It's just what
I was thinking.

947
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:57,228
I know!
I can't tell you
how much it hurt me...

948
01:01:57,261 --> 01:02:01,199
to hear that
you married him.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

949
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:03,968
I tried to tell myself,
at first,
it was for the best,

950
01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:07,939
that there was some
sort of reason for it,
but Del?

951
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:11,409
I was young
and-and stupid and scared.

You never even
gave us a chance.
I know.

how many times I-I tell
myself that same thing.

really crying here?

I'm was kinda
playing along.

956
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:32,763
What are you doing,
George?

957
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:36,868
Why does he keep
calling you George?

958
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:39,203
I don't know.

959

Listen, Betty,
I'm sure you'll understand.

960
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:47,979
David is a very busy man,
so we really have to go.

961
01:02:48,012 --> 01:02:50,114
Now.

962

It was a pleasure
meeting you.
Bye.

It was so great.

Uh, I would be honored
if you'd join us.

What... an idea.

have a lot of
catching up to do,

Yeah?

971
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:26,384
All right.

Hey, look who's here!

What's Lonnie
doing here?

01:03:53,945 --> 01:03:56,981
- What happened to you?
- Late, as usual.

I know.
Why are you guys
leaving?

- Oh. Who's the skirt?

[ Laughing ]

982
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:11,930
Apparently, somebody

referred to as a "skirt."

get you that hard.

- Do I know you?
- No, but I know
just who you are.

This doesn't look like
the kind of place
Betty would come to.

987
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:57,541
Maybe she had
to go to the bathroom.

988
01:04:57,575 --> 01:05:00,044
I mean, she does pee,
doesn't she?

989
01:05:00,078 --> 01:05:02,680
Or is she
too poised to pee?

you're cops.

it is not entirely
up to me.

Do you always get
what you want?

- Almost never.
- But you're in love with
someone who doesn't exist.

You come out here,
you meet this guy who
should laugh in your face.

you leave with him.

No! We did that

the blind one last year?

Well, you obviously

Shit, we're all the way

So you believed her enough
to come the fuck out here.

If you believed her that much,
now why is the rest of her

But that's not what
we're gonna do, is it?
No.

She's my last one.

My instincts are telling me
I've got to see this through
with her.

1354
01:28:35,392 --> 01:28:37,827
And if there's anything
I've tried to teach you here--

- It's to follow my instincts.
- No. It's to follow
my instincts.

Uh-huh. I have to go
fix what happened
to my husband.

So now you have
a husband.

in the dining room.

Oh. Did Betty call you?

She's got problems,
but... she's no killer.

I hope you guys
can just straighten this out.

a really rough day.

to help you, Betty.

in the car with your face
staring back at me.

here?
- You are in serious danger.

Oh? Well, Roy,
it's really not
a good time right now.

Betty, I would've
been here sooner,
but Elden put me in jail.

- He still thinks that
you had Del scalped.

- Hey, I never said that,
okay?

I gotta ask you
some questions about--

it's important
to find out--

It's just really,

I crossed the River Styx
to find her, pal.
