1
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,360
- Sponge.
- A little quicker.

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,910
Vitals stable and holding.

3
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,719
Close her up, will you?

4
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,839
David.

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,554
There's been a train crash
outside Santa Barbara.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,956
They're flying
an aortal trauma here now.

7
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,029
How can I ask you this, David?

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,958
I can do it, Blake.

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,678
Is he crazy, Jasmine?
He's been on his feet for 14 hours.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,268
Chloe, it's been this way
since Leslie died.

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,470
Losing himself in his work,
poor thing.

12
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,114
This is getting a little reckless,
don't you think?

13
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,992
I don't think he has a choice.

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,079
Hang on a second, Jasmine.
It's not like he has to do it.

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,111
Well, who else at Loma Vista
can do it?

16
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,352
- Who else can do what David can do?
- Try Lonnie Walsh.

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,074
And he wouldn't expect
to be knighted for it.

18
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,236
Blake, I can handle that transplant.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,193
We need somebody with the right kind
of experience, Lonnie.

20
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,151
Even if he's falling asleep
on his feet?

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,350
It's a complicated procedure, Lonnie.

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,755
- Why don't you observe?
- Excuse me, miss.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,599
- ..fresh out of medical school.
- No, you're not, Lonnie.

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,439
You're a good doctor,
but you're not David Ravell.

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,758
Miss?

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,953
Miss?

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,435
He will be held personally responsible...

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,279
..should anything go wrong
during this operation.

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,676
Moreover, you are going to tell him
it's been your observation...

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,597
- ..that Dr David Ravell...
- Did you see that?

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,429
..is not up to his usual
Olympian heights of surgical skill.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,712
He complained of dizziness this morning.
Do you understand?

33
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,117
Do you want to hear what I have in mind
for the famous Dr David Ravell?

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,312
'"A Reason to Love'" will continue
after these messages.

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,477
Skim, right?

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,358
Half a pack?

37
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,510
You know that's really fatty.
Our cook uses junk.

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,155
You sure you wouldn't
rather try a turkey burger?

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,952
You sure you want a tip
when I'm done?

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,469
You're right. It's your body.

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,274
- Right?
- That's right. Get off it.

42
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,955
- Wesley!
- Oh, that's all right.

43
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,153
I've told him the same thing, ma'am.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,755
Thanks for the suggestion.

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,237
No problem.

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,514
Hi, guys. Here you go.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,392
- Hello, Betty.
- Hi, Roy.

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,074
- You're looking good.
- You're sweet.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,193
I really enjoyed
your editorial this morning.

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,719
Thank you, I appreciate it.

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,469
I was trying to get the whole history
of the Episcopalian Church.

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,033
Oh, it was great.

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,199
Really, it just put the whole idea of
the church bake sale in perspective.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,073
Some people like to read more
than just the classifieds.

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,509
So, Sheriff, how is everything?

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,677
You know, the usual...
keeping the world safe.

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,632
I meant your food.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,918
Hmm!

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,950
(whispering ) She's coming.

60
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,516
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

61
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,196
Where'd you get it?
That's so embarrassing.

62
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,117
On the goddamn Internet.
Where else?

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,908
- Come on, pose with him, Betty.
- OK.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,993
Something for those nursing classes
you wanted to take.

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,918
But keep putting off,
thanks to a certain husband.

66
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,359
Oh, you guys, I can't.

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,754
Take it.

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,518
Betty.

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,310
Thanks, you guys.

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,479
Sizemore Motors, home of the best
selection of used cars...

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,318
..in the Big Springs-Fair Oaks area.

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,432
We can't come to the phone right now,
cos we're out making a sale.

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,709
So leave us a message.

74
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,912
Or come down and steal one of
these beauties right from under us.

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,474
- Coffee's always on.
- ( answering machine )

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,716
(Betty ) Hi, Del, it's me.

77
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,398
I guess you're busy, but...

78
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,553
I wanted to know if I could take
one of the new Buicks tonight...

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,152
(woman shrieks )

80
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,551
So call me.

81
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,037
- Whoa, hang on a second there, baby.
- Oh, hi, you're there.

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,798
- Why do you need one of the Buicks?
- You sound out of breath.

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,911
I ran back in to get the phone.

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,793
- Oh, well...
- (whispers ) Joyce.

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,038
Sue Ann is taking me out,
and I just thought it might be nice...

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,435
..to go in a new car.

87
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,228
- What was that?
- Nothing. You know, it's busy here.

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,831
You don't need a LeSabre
to go out with Sue Ann.

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,316
- I don't need one, but...
- Take the blue Corsica.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,593
Well, once he dumps her, we will.

91
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,869
Right.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,513
Oh. Hold on a second.

93
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,111
He's out pricing banners.
I don't expect him back.

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,913
- Banners?
- You know, flags and shit<i>..</i>

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,996
"For a livelier look he said.

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,514
Oh.

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,039
It's a shame about the LeSabres.
They're a real sweet ride.

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,712
Yeah.

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,118
- How are things at the Tip Top?
- Oh, they're fine.

100
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,117
Yeah, fine.

101
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,751
You, uh... you ever miss it?

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,752
You... must be kiddin'.

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,519
Oh. Yeah!

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,472
OK.

105
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,034
Hi. Yeah.

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,958
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,150
(whispers ) It's his wife.

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,508
That's what I said.
That's what I was talking about.

109
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,832
Anyway, so I was thinking Easter
cos I just fuckin' love pastels.

110
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,673
- Hi.
- Hi.

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,316
- Did you watch it yet?
- I sure did.

112
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,318
I tell you what,
if that man got any better looking...

113
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,000
- <i>..</i>it would be a crime of some sort.
- I know.

114
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,955
OK, you ready?
I've got a surprise for tonight.

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,389
We're going to the Starlight in style.

116
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,317
- Oh, Betty.
- OK, I'll give you a hint.

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,115
You squint your eyes,
it looks just like a Jaguar.

118
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,837
I am so sorry.
I was gonna call you.

119
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,475
Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's
no way I can get a sitter this fast.

120
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,155
- I feel awful.
- It's OK.

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,357
Maybe next week
we can go bowling or...

122
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,391
That'd be great. Yeah.

123
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,078
That'd be great.

124
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,632
Well... thanks.

125
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,713
OK, well, have a happy birthday.
OK? Have a good time.

126
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,834
I'd better... go start dinner.

127
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,073
OK, here we go.

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,319
- You sure you don't want any salad?
- I don't want any salad.

129
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,634
OK.

130
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,031
OK.

131
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,515
What was all that shit on the phone
about the Buicks?

132
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,757
I told you.
Sue Ann was gonna take me out, but...

133
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,873
She's not comfortable in a Corsica?
It's got air. It's got leather.

134
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,114
Actually, I'm glad you're going out tonight.
I got something going on.

135
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,670
Some serious clients...
with real potential.

136
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,952
Oh.

137
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,236
So, um... who are these clients?

138
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,678
Couple of guys in from out of town.
They wanna see the new LeSabres.

139
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,153
New LeSabres?

140
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,273
Jesus Christ.
Look at these guys.

141
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,072
Who are they fuckin'?

142
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,476
You know these actors are mainly
models, which are mainly faggots.

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,431
Oh?

144
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,152
And the rest are assholes.

145
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,035
Know what bugs me most
about those soaps?

146
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,279
- It's people with no lives...
- Watching other people's fake lives.

147
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,637
Yeah, well... nothing like
watching the tenpins fall.

148
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,155
Hey, that's a skill.

149
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,869
They're trying to get that
in the Olympic Games.

150
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,154
All right, I'm gonna go out.
Clean this shit up.

151
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,157
I told him my car is in the shop.

152
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,999
He said he'd be happy
to give me a ride home tomorrow.

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,389
You're beautiful.

154
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,590
(Chloe ) Tell me something I don't know.

155
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,149
(Lonnie ) I've got some special plans
for you and I.

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,113
Things coming up in the near future
I think you'll like.

157
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,793
( car approaching )

158
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,315
All I'm saying is,
their offence sucks.

159
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,550
You could have the best
running backs in the world.

160
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,638
- Somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
- You're right there.

161
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,435
I told my wife to clean up
before she went out.

162
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,357
Let's have some music.

163
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,913
(blues-jazz )

164
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,231
You guys like music?

165
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,909
(David) ...see how fast
this beauty will go.

166
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,875
I guess somehow that speed
helps me forget the past.

167
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,676
I know I've said it before,
but I want to tell you again...

168
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,075
..how sorry I am about your wife.

169
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,430
- Well, we should probably...
- Let's not go.

170
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,271
Not yet.

171
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,519
You got a fine one right here.

172
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,557
Your wife is very attractive, Del.
Have I seen her before?

173
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,595
- If you ate at the Tip Top, you did.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah... the coffee.

174
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,754
Yeah. Betty pours a mean cup.
Let's sit in here.

175
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,874
(Chloe ) When Skipper died,
it hurt so bad...

176
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,391
I just wanted the world to go away.

177
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,429
To a successful transaction.

178
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,430
(Chloe ) We are where
we're supposed to be.

179
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,429
And if you feel something
for someone...

180
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,118
..you should...

181
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,552
Please!

182
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,029
It's not that
I don't find you attractive.

183
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,553
I'm just not ready.

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,553
No, he's not ready.

185
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,315
Nice place you got here, Del.
Real comfortable.

186
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,317
Sweet little town, Fair Oaks.

187
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,878
- Do you like it?
- Are you kidding me?

188
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
- It's a small town, man.
- What do you mean, Del?

189
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,519
- Just a bunch of dumb fucks.
- Really?

190
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,033
You better believe it.

191
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,195
- Could you give us an example?
- Of what?

192
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,033
I'm asking for an example of one
of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

193
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,993
- I don't follow.
- You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?

194
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,870
No.

195
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,993
So, give me an example of
a stupid person doing a stupid thing.

196
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,476
Not being stupid yourself,
you're equipped to know, right?

197
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,591
Are we gonna get down
to business here?

198
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,712
Just give me one example.

199
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,191
OK. OK.

200
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,514
Burger King opens up.

201
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,679
These assholes get excited, start lining
up like they've never seen one before.

202
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,711
Like it's some five-star restaurant.

203
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,068
Five stars.

204
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,118
How about it, Wesley?
That sound stupid to you?

205
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,152
No, that's ignorant.
They just don't know any better.

206
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,431
So, Del? Maybe you could give us
another example.

207
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,552
This is bullshit. Can we get
down to business here, please?

208
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,512
- Jesus Christ!
- He's waiting.

209
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,993
OK, OK, OK.

210
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,600
- Injuns are stupid.
- Injuns?

211
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,393
Did you just say "Injuns?

212
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,675
Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always
getting drunk and doing stupid shit.

213
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,234
- Like what?
- Puking on the sidewalk. Stupid shit!

214
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,629
Let's see. Around here that would be
Kiowa, Kickapoo and Osage.

215
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,157
Am I right about that?

216
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,710
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

217
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,036
Del, my idea of stupid's
different from yours.

218
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,555
So here's how this is gonna work.

219
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,199
Take your socks off.

220
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,037
Hey, come on.

221
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,117
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
I thought that you felt something for me.

222
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,117
Chloe, you're wonderful.

223
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,117
You are.

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,629
I just know that there's something
really special out there for me.

225
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,633
I don't know what it is
or who it is.

226
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,753
I just know that since Leslie died
I've had this feeling.

227
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,678
I'm gonna tell you what stupid is.

228
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,077
Stupid is taking
what doesn't belong to you. Right, Wesley?

229
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,196
That's right.

230
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,950
Stupid is trying to sell it to people who
are by their very nature untrustworthy.

231
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,753
- That is so right.
- Stupid, Del,...

232
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,077
<i>..</i>is calling people in Kansas City
who are affiliated...

233
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,589
<i>..</i>with the owners
of the thing you stole...

234
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,358
<i>..</i>and trying to sell it to them.

235
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,232
Now, that's really stupid.

236
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,519
You know, Del,...

237
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,235
<i>..</i>150 years ago, that remark you made
about the Native Americans...

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,157
<i>..</i>would have gotten you scalped.

239
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,589
Right here, you'd have been scalped.

240
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,271
- Hell of a way to die.
- Nah, Wesley, it wasn't always fatal.

241
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,197
We could scalp old Del right now...

242
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,073
<i>..</i>and he'd be plenty alive
to tell us what it feels like.

243
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,998
All you have to do is take a knife...

244
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,236
Del. Come on now,
we're just talking here.

245
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,713
(Del whimpering )

246
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,517
Come on. You just take a knife and make
a mark across the front of the forehead.

247
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,552
Grab a handful of hair
and cut as you pull.

248
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,188
It's amazing how easily
the scalp comes off.

249
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,435
A mark, huh?

250
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,960
It's OK, David.
I mean, what do I know?

251
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,557
A woman gets in your car,
you take her for a ride in the woods.

252
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,831
- Wait a minute, this was your idea.
- Who's driving the car, David?

253
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,157
- What?
- Does it really matter who said what?

254
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,429
Of course it matters.

255
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,069
I want to know the particulars
of your wrongdoing.

256
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,595
I want to know how you got
what you've stolen...

257
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,312
<i>..</i>and, of course, where it is now.

258
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,991
It's in the Buick.

259
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,079
But I swear to God I didn't touch it.
I swear to God.

260
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,311
- All right then.
- Don't kill me.

261
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,954
I don't want you to kill me!

262
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,912
Consider yourself lucky, Del.

263
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,349
Luckier than those Injuns
you've got such contempt for.

264
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,874
If anybody got a raw deal,
it was the American Indian.

265
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,594
The country has a black mark on
its soul for what happened to them.

266
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,274
I'm glad they got those casinos.

267
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,278
David, I wish I had good news for you.

268
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,437
- (Del groaning )
- I'll come right to the point.

269
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,314
Chloe Jensen has filed charges
of sexual assault against you.

270
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,839
( muffled screaming )

271
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,274
(Wesley screaming )

272
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,276
Fuckin' Christ, Wesley!

273
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,352
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?!

274
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,511
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

275
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,719
- What the fuck is your problem?!
- You told me to do it!

276
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,115
That was to get him to talk!

277
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,590
Get rid of that fuckin' thing.
Get rid of it!

278
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,917
(David) Then I can forget.

279
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,949
Ever feel like something really special
was about to happen to you, Jasmine?

280
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,349
Fuckin' great, Wesley!
Now we don't know where the stuff is.

281
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,598
- He said it's in the Buick.
- Which fuckin' Buick?

282
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,515
- Why'd you shoot him?
- I had to shoot him, Wesley.

283
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,473
It was the only decent thing to do -
after you scalped him!

284
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,719
I just know that there's something
really special out there for me.

285
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,831
Very unprofessional, Wesley!

286
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,631
I don't know what it is or who it is.
I just know that since Leslie died...

287
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,189
..I've had this... feeling.

288
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,876
I just know that there's something
really special out there for me.

289
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,078
I don't know what it is.

290
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,035
I just know that since Leslie died
I've had this feeling.

291
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,828
Betty!

292
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,158
(singsong voice ) Betty!

293
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,514
(Sue Ann screams )

294
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,517
Yeah, hand me that bag.

295
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,593
- Hey, Betty.
- Hi.

296
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,553
- Are you OK?
- I'm great.

297
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,389
I was kind of wondering if I might
be able to ask some questions...

298
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,873
<i>..</i>about what happened.

299
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,754
Well, I saw the whole thing.
It was disgusting.

300
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,717
Really?
Did you see who did it?

301
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,430
- Mm-hm.
- You did? Who was it?

302
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,594
It was Chloe.

303
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,958
You guys want to try not stepping
directly in the evidence, please?

304
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,872
Roy Ostrey!

305
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,232
You and your goddamn police scanner.
I leave here for ten minutes...

306
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,715
Betty, I'm sorry about this.

307
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,876
Oh, it's no problem.

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,956
Well, bye, Roy.

309
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,957
Nice to see you, Sheriff.

310
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,755
Thanks for stopping by.

311
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,918
Where the hell is she going?

312
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,072
I still don't understand
how you knew Del wasn't lying.

313
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,191
I saw his soul, Wesley.

314
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,552
The man was face to face with his God.
Nobody lies in that situation.

315
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,116
Your little Geronimo act rattled me,
and I abandoned my instincts.

316
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,038
- Never abandon your instincts.
- I didn't. You gave me a look.

317
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,878
What fuckin' look?

318
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,149
You got one look. You gave me this look.
I thought you were done, so I offed him.

319
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,635
I wasn't done. I was just tired
of hearing him whine.

320
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,873
And you didn't off anybody, buddy.
You scalped him.

321
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,911
Jesus, I almost puked.
Did I tell you that?

322
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,031
Then why tell me
the fuckin' Indian story?

323
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,469
What the hell does that mean, Wesley?

324
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,874
If I told you a Ty Cobb story,...

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,878
<i>..</i>would you have taken a baseball bat
and beaten him to death?

326
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,149
You...

327
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,874
Goddamn!

328
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,468
Nothing there. Let's go.

329
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,479
- You gonna leave the cars like this?
- Yeah, why not? It'll confuse 'em.

330
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,756
Gotta do something
now that you fucked it up.

331
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,190
I didn't fuck nothing up.
I was just trying to make a statement.

332
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,515
Trying to make a statement.

333
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,358
Let me tell you something.

334
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,712
In this business, you don't put food
on the table unless the phone rings.

335
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,674
The people who get the calls
are good. Not flashy - good.

336
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,076
They get in, they get out, nobody knows
a goddamn thing, you understand?

337
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,953
Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head,
you know they're dead.

338
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,878
- That's a good motto.
- I'll get you a bumper sticker.

339
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,788
You better start believing it. That's
the only statement you need to make.

340
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,189
Is this bothering you?

341
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,116
- Let's get this thing down.
- Thank you.

342
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,238
- I questioned Joyce about all this.
- Yeah?

343
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,794
It seems she was pretty familiar
with old Del.

344
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,797
On a regular basis,
if you get my drift.

345
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,354
And half the other guys in this town,
including yourself.

346
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,040
- Junior year.
- Anyway, so what?

347
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,833
So, suppose Betty found out
about them?

348
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,834
So you're saying that Betty Sizemore,
our Betty Sizemore,...

349
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,633
<i>..</i>who you went to swing choir with,...

350
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,548
<i>..</i>hired somebody to scalp her husband
in her kitchen while she watched?

351
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,875
- It's just a theory.
- You're amazing, Elden.

352
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,600
Just because I'm thinking it
doesn't mean I like it.

353
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,073
( door opens )

354
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,759
- So, how is she?
- She's in a kind of shock.

355
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,439
I see signs of a posttraumatic reaction,
with possible dissociative symptoms.

356
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,439
- Could I have that in American?
- It's a kind of altered state.

357
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,233
It allows a traumatised person
to continue functioning.

358
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,032
So she did witness it?

359
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,876
( doctor ) Without question.
But her memory of it is gone.

360
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,275
Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?

361
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,118
Good night.

362
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,510
Sue Ann, I gotta tell you something.

363
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,873
A bad thing happened
to Del and me.

364
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,149
Yeah, hon.

365
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,153
Why don't you get some sleep?
Everything's gonna be fine.

366
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,077
I know.

367
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,993
And I'm real sorry about all this.

368
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,310
But I just know there's
something special out there for me.

369
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,149
Dear Del,...

370
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,437
..this is the hardest thing
I've ever done,...

371
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,710
..but I need to be honest.

372
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,317
Admit it, Del. We've grown apart,
and you don't seem happy any more.

373
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,513
As for me, I don't think I've ever
given myself a chance.

374
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,915
But I wanna take that chance now.

375
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,870
Best of luck to you.

376
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,439
Betty.

377
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,389
This is bad, Wesley.
This is very, very bad.

378
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,879
- This is extremely bad.
- Want some bacon?

379
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,992
I don't think you appreciate
the gravity of the situation here.

380
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,429
It's bad enough that we don't have
what we came for.

381
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,676
We don't even know
where the hell it is.

382
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,799
Now this.

383
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,991
This is supposed to be my last job.

384
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,317
I mean, I even put down a deposit
on my boat.

385
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,156
How the hell can you eat
at a time like this?

386
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,077
I get nauseous just watching you.

387
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,431
Well, I can eat cos I know
we didn't kidnap no woman.

388
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,919
And I can eat cos I know
there ain't nobody looking for us.

389
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,076
And I can eat
cos I'm fuckin' hungry.

390
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,432
Relax. She'll end up on a milk carton
or something. That's about it.

391
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,033
She got outta town awful quick.

392
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,319
- And wasn't she quiet in that house?
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,273
I think most women
would have screamed, don't you?

394
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,391
I know they would have.

395
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,350
Yeah...

396
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,236
We could be dealing
with a cunning, ruthless woman here.

397
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,799
- Mrs Rogers?
- Yes.

398
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,229
Dwight Campbell, Mutual Life Insurance.

399
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,998
I'm looking for a Betty Sizemore.

400
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,509
I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

401
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,198
( electronic beeps )

402
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,873
Go to your room. Now.

403
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,437
Precious, ain't they?

404
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,634
She has a substantial
death benefit coming to her...

405
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,557
<i>..</i>from the tragic loss
of her husband.

406
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,638
- Does she have relatives in the area?
- No.

407
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,958
Well, she does have some grandparents
down in Oklahoma, but that's it.

408
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,435
- Are you in touch with Mrs Sizemore?
- No.

409
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,552
But I am taping her show for her.

410
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,716
- Her show?
- Yeah, A Reason to Love.

411
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,399
Did Chloe testify?

412
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,191
- She's been working here how long?
- Five years, give or take.

413
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,515
You two in high school together?

414
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,315
Aren't you a sweetheart.

415
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,590
No, not quite.

416
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,913
- Anyway, she's been with us a while.
- But she wanted more out of life?

417
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,316
No, she just wanted something
out of life. Anything.

418
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,393
Who's this gentleman?

419
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,159
That's just a cutout.
A gag we did for her birthday.

420
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,876
- Do you mind if I keep these?
- If it'll help bring her back, be my guest.

421
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,040
I hope you didn't get
the wrong idea on the phone, Lonnie.

422
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,559
Oh, I don't think so, Chloe.

423
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,555
But when they call you to the stand,
just say what you're supposed to say.

424
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,833
You mean I'm gonna have to swear?
On a Bible?

425
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,155
Relax. It's a hearing. But they are
gonna ask you some questions.

426
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,872
- Oh, no!
- So...

427
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,554
- You're into Reason too?
- Is David gonna be there?

428
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,996
I'm Ellen.
What can I get you?

429
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,031
Um... a lite beer, please.

430
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,316
You're a beautiful, intelligent,
sexy woman.

431
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,634
Thank you.

432
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,070
With a torn blouse.
You can't lose.

433
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,588
- '"A Reason to Love'" will continue...
- Ellen, do you have a phone?

434
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,271
Here you go. If it's long distance, you can
leave me a buck when you're done.

435
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,719
Thanks.

436
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,752
( ringing )

437
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,075
Hello?

438
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,394
- Sue Ann?
- Betty!

439
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,353
Hi. Just calling
to tell you that I'm fine.

440
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,508
- Where are you?
- I'm in the Canyon Ranch Bar in, um...

441
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,710
- Williams.
- In Williams, Arizona.

442
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,520
- So I guess I'm halfway there.
- Halfway to where?

443
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,991
You've gotta come home!
We've been really worried about you.

444
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,953
Sue Ann, I thought
you'd back me on this.

445
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,469
You know how it is with Del.

446
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,556
- How did he take my note?
- Listen to me.

447
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,713
A nice man came by
from Mutual Life Insurance.

448
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,435
He says you've got a lot of money
coming to you from Del's policy.

449
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,879
What are you talking about?

450
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,719
Del's life insurance policy.
Are you with me?

451
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,909
Oh - I've gotta go.

452
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,519
Betty, listen to me.

453
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,279
- Del is dead!
- What did I ever do to her?

454
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,550
It's what you didn't do, bud.

455
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,679
- So where you headed, Betty?
- Los Angeles, California.

456
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,951
And you called your friend,
and she's telling you not to go?

457
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,712
When I went to Europe,
my friends told me I was crazy.

458
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,195
Europe? The Europe?

459
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,232
God, this is my first time
out of Kansas.

460
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,316
I should call you Dorothy.

461
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,195
When I first left here,
I went straight to Italy.

462
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,679
Everyone told me not to go,
but, oh, I wanted to go to Rome,...

463
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,917
<i>..</i>ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn
in Roman Holiday.

464
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,354
- And goddamn it, I went!
- Did you love it?

465
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,989
Rome was the best thing
I ever did... because I did it.

466
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,193
I swear to you, it changed me.

467
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,034
I've been to Rome, Italy.

468
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
And I sat every morning
in the Caffe Sistina...

469
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,109
<i>..</i>and I drank my cappuccino, and I...

470
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,275
I watched the pilgrims walk to Mass.

471
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,676
No one can ever
take that away from me.

472
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,194
I left my husband three days ago.

473
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,870
- Really?
- Yeah!

474
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,038
I'm getting back
with my ex-fiance.

475
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,638
He proposed to me right around here,
so this is kind of a sentimental stop.

476
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,314
(song ) When I was just a little girl

477
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,356
I asked my mother

478
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,275
What will I be

479
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,510
Will I be pretty

480
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,191
Will I be rich

481
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,550
Here's what she said to me.:

482
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,189
Que sera, sera

483
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,517
Whatever will be

484
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,029
I thought this was your first time
out of Kansas.

485
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,196
Well, I mean, except for then.

486
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,517
I'm trading in a car dealer
for a heart surgeon,...

487
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,598
- <i>..</i>so that's not too bad, huh?
- Nice move!

488
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,633
- Cedars Sinai?
- No, no, no. Loma Vista.

489
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,750
I suppose his name is David Ravell.

490
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,991
How did you know that?

491
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,872
What's his real name?

492
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,037
It's Dr David Ravell.
But how did you know?

493
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,629
Do you mean George McCord, the actor?

494
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,352
No. No, no, no.

495
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,431
David Ravell.
He's a heart specialist.

496
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,711
I know. We just watched him.

497
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,989
You're serious.

498
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,795
How are you going to find him, Betty?

499
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,673
Well, I'll go to the hospital.

500
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,192
What if, when you get there, nothing's
like you thought it was gonna be?

501
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,076
Well, this is the biggest thing
that I've ever done...

502
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,790
<i>..</i>and I have to do it.

503
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,552
You take care of yourself, Betty.

504
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,511
To tell you the truth,
I can't believe I've made it this far.

505
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,119
Betty is a big fan of the
soap opera A Reason to Love.

506
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,834
- Look. That's important.
- Why do I need to look at it?

507
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,757
- He told you to do this, huh?
- No!

508
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,952
No! I saw, on television,
Chloe and Lonnie.

509
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,877
They're television characters.

510
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,709
And Betty is in love with
Dr David Ravell from the show.

511
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,149
What if she's in Los Angeles
looking for him?

512
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,068
- The actor, I mean, not the...
- That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.

513
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,795
It's dumb? Then why did Betty call
Sue Ann from Arizona yesterday?

514
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,673
- She called me yesterday.
- Said she was in Arizona, did she?

515
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,475
- Yes!
- This is even stupider than I thought.

516
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,192
This woman is on the run,...

517
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,357
<i>..</i>and you think she's just
gonna phone in her location?

518
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,153
- Just call the LA police!
- You have got to do that!

519
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,669
Hey! I'm the law.

520
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,590
I ain't gotta do nothing.

521
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,360
( man ) That's Betty when she was 12.

522
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,519
Very graceful.

523
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,390
- Perfect form.
- Yeah.

524
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,078
Such poise too.

525
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,193
Very impressive.

526
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,597
Thank you, ma'am.

527
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,030
Did she ever give you any indication
that she might leave her husband?

528
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,870
She put up with things
that I wouldn't have.

529
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,317
And yet she, of all people,
defended him.

530
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,515
That's why what that sheriff said
made me angry.

531
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,630
What do you mean?

532
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,634
If anyone paid to have
that husband of hers killed...

533
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,068
<i>..</i>it would have been me.

534
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,878
Well, Mr and Mrs Blaine,...

535
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,470
<i>..</i>I can assure you without a doubt
that your granddaughter is alive.

536
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,871
She had absolutely nothing to do
with the killing of Del Sizemore.

537
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,549
You've got to be missing
a piece of your soul to kill someone.

538
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,829
That's not our Betty.

539
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,072
Why you got to be missing
a piece of your soul to kill somebody?

540
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,196
Because it's not natural, young man.

541
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,312
It's very, very natural to kill.
All species kill.

542
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,918
See, God kills.

543
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,349
You saying that God's missing
a piece of his soul?

544
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,992
My partner's young, Mr Blaine.
He loves his job.

545
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,519
Loves his job. Matter of fact, he'd like
to kill all the criminals himself.

546
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,439
Let me just ask you this.

547
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,556
If Betty was running from someone,
where do you think she'd go?

548
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,111
I don't know every doctor
that works here.

549
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,358
But Dr Ravell is the finest surgeon
on the staff.

550
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,240
You must know him.
He's really handsome...

551
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,079
<i>..</i>and he's gentle and considerate.

552
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,875
- He's being sued for sexual assault.
- What?

553
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,798
Well, he didn't do it.
He was set up.

554
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,277
Well, I certainly would have heard
about that.

555
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,278
He's only here twice a week.

556
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,789
He's also on staff
over at Loma Vista.

557
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,356
- I don't think I know that hospital.
- It's the one in the pretty area...

558
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,278
<i>..</i>with the palm trees out front
and the mountains in the back.

559
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,869
You've just described
all of southern California.

560
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,117
Well, I'm sorry,
but I can't even consider you...

561
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,919
<i>..</i>without references and a resume.

562
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,396
And, frankly, I don't know
how you could have forgotten them.

563
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,793
Hi.

564
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,595
Who...

565
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,517
Who are you?

566
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,675
Betty.

567
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,193
Nurse Betty.

568
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,713
(tyres screeching )

569
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,395
Hold it, hold it!

570
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,757
(shouting in Spanish )

571
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,317
Help us! Please, somebody!

572
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,717
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

573
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,070
You've got to help me!
My brother is dying!

574
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,038
(Spanish )

575
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,753
( man ) Drop your weapon!

576
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,074
Hi.

577
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,678
Let's see.
Are you choking?

578
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,478
OK, let me look.

579
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,275
Oh! He has the... he has the thingy!

580
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,072
The air in the hole!

581
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,670
He has too much air
around the heart and the lungs...

582
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,236
<i>..</i>so I have to open...
I have to relieve the pressure...

583
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,316
<i>..</i>so he can breathe.

584
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,159
- Here we go.
- What are you doing? You'll hurt him!

585
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,157
No, I have to do this,
or he'll die.

586
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,511
It's OK, I've seen it done once.
Here we go. Ready?

587
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,078
See? Wasn't so bad.

588
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,833
- Is he gonna be all right?
- We'll do everything we can for him.

589
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,030
You should thank that nurse
for what she did.

590
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,229
Iris, who is that remarkable nurse?

591
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,119
What you did yesterday
was reckless.

592
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,033
You are not an employee of this hospital.
If that boy dies,...

593
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,197
<i>..</i>I don't even want to think about
the lawsuit that will follow.

594
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,039
- Are we communicating here?
- Yes, ma'am.

595
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,591
Good. Because I'm prepared
to offer you a job.

596
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,037
You can help out in the pharmacy...

597
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,310
<i>..</i>until your references arrive.

598
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,155
But you are not to touch anyone.

599
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,998
Is that totally clear?

600
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,308
Well, he's doing fine.

601
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,397
Ay, gracias a Dios.

602
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,675
- You don't sound like you're from here.
- No, I'm from Kansas. I just drove in.

603
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,189
- Why did you come to LA?
- I came for love.

604
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,311
My ex-fiance lives here, so...

605
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,948
(Spanish ) That's great!

606
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,675
- So are you staying with him?
- Oh, no.

607
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,079
I don't actually know where he is just yet,
so I'm at a motel around the corner.

608
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,158
(Spanish ) She should stay with you.

609
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,353
She has nowhere to live.

610
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,229
This neighbourhood.
You get used to it.

611
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,955
- Oh, pretty.
- Yeah, I got this apartment with a guy.

612
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,434
- The guy you were telling me about?
- No, this one was worse.

613
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,677
I had to have the place
sprayed when he left. Twice.

614
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,995
He was two before the last one,...

615
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,351
<i>..</i>not counting a little office thing,
which I'm trusting you with,<i>..</i>

616
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,677
<i>..</i>because if it gets out,
I'm on the street, know what I'm saying?

617
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,033
Oh, wow!

618
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,678
This is nice!

619
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,112
Oh, I love the aquarium.

620
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,516
Yeah, well, at least fish don't pee
on the seat.

621
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,668
Just once I wish I'd run into a guy
who would notice them before my tits.

622
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,557
- Come on. I will show you to your room.
- OK.

623
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,955
- (funk-pop on radio )
- No, no. We'll find her.

624
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,393
That's it.

625
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,678
I understand.

626
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,594
- So what'd they say?
- They said find it.

627
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,438
Find her.
Finish the job we were paid to do.

628
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,678
- Half.
- What?

629
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,633
They only paid us half,
so they still owe us the other half.

630
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,991
Oh, goddamn, Wesley.
There you go again!

631
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,556
The same lousy-assed attitude
that got us here in the first place.

632
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,752
That make-a-statement,
do-an-end-zone dance,...

633
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,189
<i>..</i>shake-your-ass-
and-sue-everybody attitude...

634
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,393
<i>..</i>that's dragging this whole
fuckin' country down the drain!

635
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,069
You get paid when a job is done!
And we haven't done the goddamn job!

636
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,839
- I know that.
- Turn off that goddamn music!

637
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,834
Do I deserve this? In the twilight
of my career, do I deserve this?

638
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,476
I don't think so. I never took out
anybody that didn't have it coming.

639
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,679
I'm a fuckin' professional!
And where am I? Purgatory!

640
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,997
- Worse. You're in Texas.
- I am very tired.

641
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,439
I've worked hard, and my work
should be over, but it's not.

642
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,957
This fuckin' job is just beginning.

643
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,437
Betty, Betty, Betty.

644
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,516
What's going through
that pretty little head of yours?

645
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,194
Everyone says, if you're gonna get
married, this is the spot to find someone.

646
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,196
Oh, yeah?

647
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,116
Yeah.

648
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,358
Luckily for me, I'm off men, so I have
the luxury of not giving a shit.

649
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,279
You know, the more I think about it,
David probably wouldn't come here.

650
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,789
He's still getting over
Leslie and everything.

651
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,558
- Who is Leslie?
- His wife.

652
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,238
- He has a wife?
- Oh, no. Had.

653
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,715
She died in a car wreck last year.

654
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,149
- Decapitated.
- God, that's awful!

655
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,636
They're not even sure it was an accident
cos they never found her head.

656
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,593
Her head?
You are making this up.

657
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,918
No, see, she was having an affair
with the Russian diplomat...

658
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,032
<i>..</i>and they think he was
mixed up in the Mafia or something.

659
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,073
And I thought my love life was crazy.

660
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,076
So, we'll start at the library first,
and we'll fan out from there.

661
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,556
They've got all the LA phone books,
plus medical directories...

662
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,954
OK.

663
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,152
We're not gonna let him hide
from you any longer, all right?

664
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,952
All right.

665
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,958
I am going to make this
my personal mission.

666
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,233
I can't believe you're doing
all this for me, Rosa.

667
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,954
I just want to make sure
that you get your...

668
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,913
<i>..</i>fairy-tale ending, or whatever.

669
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,237
At least one of us should.

670
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,709
Thank you.

671
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,029
You're welcome.

672
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,038
- Hola.
- Hola.

673
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,749
(Spanish ) What do you think my father
would say...

674
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,793
<i>..</i>if I told him I didn't want to
be a lawyer any more?

675
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,753
Nothing... He would just kill you.

676
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,756
How is it going with your new
roommate? What's her name?

677
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,596
Betty.

678
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,349
She's all right, but I'm tired.

679
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,230
Why?

680
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,353
We spent all weekend looking
for her doctor-boy.

681
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,079
How can a big-time heart guy
leave no trace of himself?

682
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,473
Don't know.

683
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,471
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice.

684
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,748
Where does he work?

685
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,998
I don't know. She said he
used to be at... Loma Vista.

686
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,472
Loma Vista?
What's his name?

687
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,312
David Ravell.

688
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,792
Loma Vista?
David Ravell?

689
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,629
You're talking about the guy
on A Reason to Love.

690
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,712
(tapping )

691
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,390
- Hi.
- Guess who I saw today.

692
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,909
- Who?
- Dr David Ravell.

693
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,792
You're kidding. Where?

694
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,195
- On television.
- Really?!

695
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,470
Cut the shit, will you?

696
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,478
Either you're making a fool out of me
because you get off on it,...

697
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,239
<i>..</i>or you got some serious problems.
Which one is it, Betty?

698
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,112
What are you talking about?

699
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,472
I'm talking about Dr David Ravell.

700
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,828
I know. I heard you, but...

701
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,918
You have a thing for an actor
on some stupid white soap opera...

702
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,315
<i>..</i>and we searched all over town
for his character.

703
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,194
Not the actor, whose real name is George,
by the way, but his character, Betty!

704
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,388
Are you having a nervous breakdown?

705
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,759
Rosa...

706
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,599
I trusted you, Betty.
I thought he was real.

707
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,872
- He is real.
- You need serious help.

708
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,030
I bet she's comfortable
in that air-conditioned car right now.

709
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,392
You don't look all that
comfortable here, little baby.

710
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,670
Cos you don't like being
the centre of attention, do you?

711
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,313
- Nah. You're like me.
- You smoking?

712
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,715
- Huh?
- What's wrong with you?

713
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,237
What the fuck, Wesley!

714
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,193
That was a shitty thing to do!

715
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,794
I'm sick of seeing her fuckin' face!

716
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,118
I will shoot that bitch
like she'd scratched my car!

717
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,117
Don't talk like that.

718
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,951
My last one.

719
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,557
My final target.

720
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,319
Don't you realise
that you're special?

721
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,670
Don't you know
you represent something?

722
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,199
- What?
- What?

723
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,108
What does she represent? What does
some skinny white bitch from Kansas...

724
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,391
<i>..</i>who's dragging our asses up and down
the Louisiana Purchase,...

725
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,909
<i>..</i>what does she represent?
Please tell me.

726
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,314
Please!

727
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,197
I don't know.

728
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,712
Something.

729
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,039
Charlie, they found her in Vegas.
Perfect description.

730
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,958
Says she's with the buyer
that Del lined up.

731
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,712
How'd they describe her?

732
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,871
Blonde, thin, whatever.

733
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,429
Well now... blonde, thin, yeah.

734
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,552
Did they say anything about style?
Did they mention grace?

735
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,959
Hi.

736
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,278
(Spanish ) Tell me... Is your friend
still trying to find that soap opera guy?

737
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,552
Yes. I'd love to find that actor
so he could burst her bubble.

738
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,354
Here's your needle.

739
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,318
He's supposed to make
an appearance here tonight.

740
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,918
Hey.

741
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,278
Hey.

742
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,598
This is crazy. I come home,
you go to your room.

743
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,995
You go to the kitchen,
I go to my room.

744
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,997
It's stupid.

745
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,671
So, what do you say?
Can... can we be friends?

746
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,237
All right.

747
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,878
What are those?

748
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,636
Hey, look. Look.

749
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,637
Don't have time to look at
a hole in the ground.

750
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,479
I'm talking about one of the seven
natural wonders of the world here.

751
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,431
It'd be dark before you even got there.

752
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,235
You wanna see the Grand Canyon
at night? Shit ain't grand. It's bland.

753
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,591
- What the hell does it matter?
- We could be in Vegas in four hours.

754
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,313
Shit, she wasn't in Kansas City.

755
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,516
- I know.
- She wasn't in Dallas or Houston.

756
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,234
What makes you think
she's gonna be in Vegas?

757
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,794
Think she's gonna be there
with tassels on her titties?

758
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,353
- No.
- Listen.

759
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,438
"When I grow up,
I'm going to become a nurse...

760
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,152
<i>..</i>or a veterinarian.''

761
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,555
''I always wanted to help people...

762
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,036
<i>..</i>and value all life,
be it animal, plant or mineral.

763
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,798
That sound like
a showgirl to you?

764
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,629
Keep turning the pages. I'm sure she
blows a few strangers before it's done.

765
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,879
- Do you hear yourself?
- What?

766
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,831
You sound like a fuckin' madman!

767
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,868
- Are you an American, Wesley?
- Yes, I'm an American.

768
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,117
And, no, I'm not going
to the fuckin' Bland Canyon.

769
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,753
You don't know what you're missing.

770
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,073
Asshole.

771
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,352
(phone rings )

772
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,356
- What's up?
- Mr Campbell?

773
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,517
- Huh?
- Is this Mutual Life Insurance?

774
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,399
Hello? Hello?

775
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,238
Yeah, this is Dwight Campbell.

776
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,150
My name's Sue Ann Rogers. I'm Betty
Sizemore's friend. I've heard from her.

777
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,630
- Yeah?
- She was at a bar in Arizona.

778
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,876
(music swells )

779
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,031
(song ) Don't you know

780
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,471
I was yours from the very day

781
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,034
That you happened to come my way

782
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,551
Can't you see

783
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,918
I'm under your spell

784
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,951
By the look in my eyes

785
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,031
Can't you tell

786
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,840
Can't you tell

787
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,990
Now, don't you know

788
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,309
Every beat of my heart

789
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,032
Thank you.

790
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,230
Keeps crying out

791
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,956
What the fuck?

792
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,832
I want you so

793
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,473
(honks horn )

794
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,113
Don't you know

795
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,153
Come here!

796
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,590
Did you have a good time?

797
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,958
You make a wish?
Get in touch with your blackness?

798
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,711
Found your Betty.

799
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,150
At least where she's been hanging out.

800
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,476
Where? Where is she?

801
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,909
- I'm not telling you.
- What?

802
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,395
I'm not telling you
till you straighten out.

803
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,359
Dancing around like
fuckin' Bojangles out there.

804
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,314
What the fuck?
This shit's gotta stop, and I mean it!

805
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,871
Do you think we should go in and sit?

806
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,794
No, I was thinking we could just stay
out here for a little while...

807
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,592
<i>..</i>and mingle a little bit.

808
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,755
OK.

809
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,513
Well, I'm glad to be here.
Oh, sure.

810
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,791
Look who's here.

811
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,309
Over there.
