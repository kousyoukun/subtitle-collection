1
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,720
Sponge.

2
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:50,861
Vitals stable and holding.

3
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,530
Close her up, will you?

4
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:15,810
David.

5
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,171
There's been a train crash
outside Santa Barbara.

6
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,870
They're flying an aortal trauma here now.

7
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,269
How can I ask you this, David?

8
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,871
I can do it, Blake.

9
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,270
Is he crazy, Jasmine?
He's been on his feet for 14 hours.

10
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,270
Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie died.

11
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,370
Losing himself in his work, poor thing.

12
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,770
This is getting a little reckless,
don't you think?

13
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,771
- I don't think he has a choice.
- Hang on a second, Jasmine!

14
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,770
It's not like he has to do it.

15
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:07,770
Well, who else at Loma Vista can do it?
Who else can do what David can do?

16
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,969
Try Lonnie Walsh. And he wouldn't
expect to be knighted for it.

17
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,170
Blake, I can handle that transplant.

18
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,970
We need somebody
with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.

19
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,870
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?

20
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:21,869
It's a complicated procedure, Lonnie.
Why don't you observe?

21
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,071
- Hey, I'm not fresh out of medical school!
- Excuse me, miss?

22
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:29,370
No, you're not, Lonnie. You're a good
doctor. But you're not David Ravell.

23
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,371
- Miss? Miss?
- You will march into Mr Daniels' office...

24
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,370
...and tell him that he will be held
personally responsible...

25
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,570
...should anything go wrong
during this operation.

26
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,070
- Mother...
- Moreover, you are going to tell him...

27
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,569
...that in your observation...
- Did you see that?

28
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,671
...Dr David Ravell is not up to his usual
Olympian heights of surgical skill.

29
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,570
He complained of dizziness,
that sort of thing. Do you understand?

30
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,970
Do you want to hear what I have in mind
for the famous Dr David Ravell?

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,170
A Reason To Love
will continue after these messages.

32
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,370
Skim, right?

33
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,670
And half a pack.

34
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,472
You know, that's really fatty.
Our cook uses junk.

35
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:15,171
You sure you wouldn't rather try
a, um, a turkey burger?

36
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:17,572
You sure you want a tip when I'm done?

37
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:20,372
You're right. It's your body

38
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:23,172
That's right. Get off it.

39
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,273
Wesley.

40
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:27,472
- That's all right.
- I've told him the same thing, ma'am.

41
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,772
Thanks for the suggestion.

42
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,172
No problem.

43
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,372
Hi, guys. Here you go.

44
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,272
- Hello, Betty.
- Hi, Roy.

45
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,972
- You're looking good.
- You're sweet.

46
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:55,172
Hey, y'know, I really enjoyed
your editorial this morning.

47
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:58,972
Well, thank you. I appreciate it. I was
really trying to get the whole history...

48
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,672
...of the Episcopalian Church...
- Oh, it was great

49
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:05,772
Really, it just put the whole idea
of the church bake sale into perspective.

50
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,772
Some people like to read
more than just the classifieds.

51
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,473
So, Sheriff, how is everything?

52
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:16,572
Y'know, the usual. Keepin' the world safe.

53
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,273
- I meant your food.

54
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,272
Hm.

55
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,171
She's coming.

56
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,573
- Surprise!
- Oh...

57
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,373
Happy birthday!

58
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:38,673
- Ta-dah!
- Oh!

59
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:41,473
Where did you get it?
That's so embarrassing.

60
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:44,373
- On the goddamn Internet, where else?
- Come on, pose with him, Betty.

61
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,773
OK.

62
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:48,272
- Oh...

63
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,672
A little something for those nursing
classes you've been wantin' to take.

64
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:56,772
But keep puttin' off, thanks to
a certain husband we won't mention.

65
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,972
- Oh, you guys, I can't.
- Take it.

66
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:01,374
- No, I can't.
- Betty.

67
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:07,973
- Aw.
- Thanks, you guys.

68
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:13,573
Sizemore Motors, the best selection of
used cars in Big Springs-Fair Oaks.

69
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:17,073
- We're out making a sale...

70
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,372
...so leave us a message.

71
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:21,973
Better yet, come on down and steal one
of these beauties right out from under us!

72
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,572
- Coffee's always up!

73
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:28,272
Betty Hi, Del, it's me.
I guess you're busy, but...

74
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:32,373
...I wanted to know if I could take
one of the new Buicks tonight.

75
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,572
Um, so, call me, um...

76
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,872
- Whoa! Hang on a second, there, baby.
- Oh! Hi! You're there.

77
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:46,072
What do you need
one of them Buicks for?

78
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:50,172
- What... You sound out of breath.
- I ran back in to get the phone.

79
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,573
- Oh. Well, um...
- No, no. Wait. Joyce.

80
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:56,873
...Sue Ann is taking me out, and, uh,
I just thought it might be nice...

81
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,773
...to go in a new car.

82
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:00,972
What was that?

83
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:04,472
- Nothin'. God, y'know, it's busy here!
- Um... Well...

84
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:06,572
You don't need a LeSabre
to go out with Sue Ann.

85
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:09,973
- I don't need one, but...
- Take the blue Corsica.

86
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:36,273
Well, once he dumps her, we will. Right.

87
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,373
Oh, hold on a sec.

88
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:41,573
Yeah, he's out pricing banners,
but I don't expect him back.

89
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,772
Oh. Banners?

90
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:47,874
You know, flags and shit.
For a... For a livelier look, he said.

91
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,373
Oh.

92
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:53,974
Oh! It's a shame about the LeSabre.
They're a real sweet ride.

93
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,573
Yeah.

94
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:58,273
How are things at the Tip Top?

95
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,773
Oh, they're fine.

96
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:02,873
Yeah, fine.

97
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,572
You, uh, ever miss it?

98
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:08,672
You must be kidding.

99
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:12,473
Oh, yeah.  OK.

100
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,874
Hi. Yeah.

101
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,473
Yeah. Uh-huh.

102
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:19,373
It was his wife.

103
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:25,973
Uh, that's what I said. That's what
I was talking... Yeah, I was talking about.

104
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:30,772
Anyway, so I was thinkin' Easter,
cos I just fuckin' love pastels.

105
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,573
- Hi.
- Hi.

106
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:01,173
- Did you watch it yet?
- Oh! I sure did.

107
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,173
I tell you what,
if that man got any better-looking...

108
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:06,874
...it would be a crime of some sort.
- I know.

109
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:09,473
OK, are you ready?

110
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:14,174
I've got a surprise for tonight.
We're going to the Starlight in style.

111
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:16,175
- Oh, Betty.
- OK, I'll give you a hint.

112
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:20,174
You squint your eyes,
and it looks just like a Jaguar.

113
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:23,374
I am so sorry, I was gonna call you.

114
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:27,374
Larry's got a lodge meeting.
There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.

115
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,075
- I feel awful.
- Oh, that's OK.

116
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,376
- Maybe next week we can go bowling or...
- Yeah, that'd be great.

117
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:36,075
Yeah. That'd be great.

118
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,475
Well, thanks!

119
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:42,576
OK, well, have a happy birthday. OK?
Have a good time.

120
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,275
I'd better go start dinner.

121
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,875
OK, here we go.

122
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:55,976
Mm-hm.
You sure you don't want any salad?

123
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:59,175
- No, I don't want any goddamn salad.
- OK.

124
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:02,275
- OK... OK, here we go.
- What was all that shit about the Buicks?

125
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,775
I told you. Sue Ann was
going to take me out, but, um...

126
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:09,975
What, she's not comfortable in a Corsica?
It's got air, it's got leather.

127
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:12,476
Actually, I'm glad you're going out tonight.

128
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,475
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I got something goin' on.

129
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:18,776
- Mm.
- Some serious clients. With real potential.

130
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,875
Oh.

131
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:24,876
So, um... who are these clients?

132
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:30,675
Just a coupla guys in from out of town.
They want to see the new LeSabres.

133
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,975
The LeSabres?

134
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,375
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh...

135
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,975
Look at these guys. Who are they fuckin'?

136
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:41,375
You know these actors are mainly
models. Which are mainly faggots.

137
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,174
Oh?

138
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,976
And the rest are assholes.

139
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,876
Y'know what bugs me most about
those soaps? It's people with no lives...

140
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:01,376
- Watching other people's fake lives.
...watching other people's fake lives.

141
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:07,775
Yeah, well... nothing like
watching the tenpins fall, huh?

142
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,975
Hey, that's a skill!

143
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:13,876
They're tryin' to get that
in the Olympic Games.

144
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:20,376
All right, I'm gonna go out.
Clean this shit up.

145
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,076
I told him my car's in the shop.

146
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,875
He said he'd be happy
to give me a ride home tomorrow.

147
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:02,176
- You're beautiful.
- Tell me something I don't know.

148
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,076
Well, I've got some special plans
for you and I.

149
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,976
Things coming up in the near future
I think you'll like.

150
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,676
Mmm. Uh-huh?

151
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,375
All I'm sayin' is their offence sucks.

152
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,176
You could have the best damn
running backs in the world...

153
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:37,576
...somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
- You're a hundred per cent right, there.

154
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:40,376
I told my wife to clean this shit up
before she went out.

155
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:46,176
Let's have some music.

156
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:50,176
- Swinging sax
- You guys like music?

157
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,576
...have to see how fast this beauty'll go.

158
00:11:56,975 --> 00:12:00,777
I guess somehow that
speed helps me forget the past.

159
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,877
Listen, David.

160
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:07,976
I know I've said it before, but I want to tell
you again how sorry I am about your wife.

161
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,276
- Well, we should probably...
- Let's not go.

162
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,176
Not yet.

163
00:12:13,176 --> 00:12:15,376
You got a fine one right here!

164
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,376
Your wife is very attractive, Del.
Have I seen her before?

165
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,176
If you ate at the Tip Top, you did.

166
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:25,376
Oh, yeah. Yeah. The coffee.

167
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:30,376
Yeah, Betty pours a mean cup.

168
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:32,576
Sit in here.

169
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:35,676
Chloe
When Skipper died, it hurt so bad.

170
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,975
I just wanted the world to go away.

171
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,376
To a successful transaction.

172
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:50,777
We are where we're supposed to be.
And if you feel...

173
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:53,477
...something... for someone...

174
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,976
...you should...
- No...

175
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,276
passionate kisses

176
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,376
- Oh!
- Please!

177
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:09,276
It's not that I don't find you attractive.

178
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,377
I'm just not ready.

179
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:13,975
No, he's not ready.

180
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,177
Nice place you got here, Del.
Real comfortable.

181
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,778
Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it?

182
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:23,978
What, are you kiddin' me?
It's a small town, man.

183
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:25,378
What do you mean, Del?

184
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:28,379
- Just a bunch of dumb fucks.
- Really?

185
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:32,878
You better believe it.

186
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,979
Could you give us an example?

187
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:37,978
Of what?

188
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:44,979
I'm asking for an example of one of
these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.

189
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:45,879
I don't follow.

190
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:48,778
- You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
- No.

191
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:52,979
So, give me an example
of a stupid person doing a stupid thing.

192
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:56,479
Not being stupid yourself,
you're equipped to know. Right?

193
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,478
Are we gonna get down
to business here or not?

194
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,179
Just give me one example.

195
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:03,978
One.

196
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,178
OK. OK.

197
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:11,279
Burger King opens up.

198
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,378
These assholes get excited and line up
like they've never seen one before.

199
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,478
Like it's some kind of five-star restaurant.

200
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,979
- Five stars.
- Yeah.

201
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,279
How about it, Wesley?
That sound stupid to you?

202
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:29,179
No, that's ignorant.
They just don't know any better.

203
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,178
So, Del, maybe you could give us
another example.

204
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:36,279
This is bullshit!
Can we get down to business, please?

205
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,279
Jesus Christ!

206
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,779
- He's waiting.
- OK, OK, OK!

207
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:43,279
- I don't know, Injuns are stupid.
- Injuns?

208
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,179
Del, did you just say "Injuns"?

209
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:49,379
Indians. Injuns, whatever.

210
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,578
I mean, they're always getting drunk
and doin' stupid shit.

211
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,979
- Like what?
- Pukin' on the sidewalk. Stupid shit.

212
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,978
Well, let's see.

213
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,478
Round here, that would be Kiowa,
Kickapoo and Osage.

214
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:02,079
Am I right about that?

215
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:06,379
- I... I don't know.
- You don't know.

216
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,579
Del...

217
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,779
...my idea of stupid's different from yours.

218
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:13,579
So here's how this is gonna work.

219
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,478
- Take your socks off.

220
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,879
- Sobs
- Oh, hey, come on.

221
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,978
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

222
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:26,678
- I thought that you felt something for me.
- Chloe, you're wonderful.

223
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,079
You are.

224
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,578
I just know that there's something
really special out there for me.

225
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,779
I don't know what it is, or who it is.

226
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,479
I just know that since Leslie died,
I've had this feeling...

227
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,578
Del, wanna know what stupid is?

228
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,978
Stupid is taking what doesn't belong
to you. Isn't that right, Wesley?

229
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:49,579
That's right.

230
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,980
Stupid is trying to sell it to people who
are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.

231
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,078
- That is so right.
- Stupid is calling people in Kansas City...

232
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:02,279
...who are affiliated to the rightful owners
of the thing you stole...

233
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,279
...and trying to sell it to them.

234
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,179
Now, that's really stupid.

235
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,578
You know, Del...

236
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:21,080
...150 years ago, your remark about Native
Americans would've gotten you scalped.

237
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,479
Right here where your house is,
you'd have been scalped.

238
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,579
- Hell of a way to die.
- Now, Wesley, it wasn't always fatal.

239
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:32,878
We could scalp old Del right now. He'd be
plenty alive to tell us what it feels like.

240
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,379
All you have to do is take a knife...

241
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:39,179
Del, come on, now, we're just talking.

242
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:41,578
- Come on.

243
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,480
You just take a knife, and you make
a mark across the front of the forehead.

244
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,579
Grab 'em a handful of hair,
and cut as you pull.

245
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,079
It's amazing how easily
the scalp comes off.

246
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,280
- A mark, huh?

247
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:56,979
- It's OK, David.
- Shh!

248
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,779
I mean, what do I know?

249
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,579
A woman gets in your car,
you take her for a ride in the woods...

250
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,779
- Wait a minute. This was your idea.
- Who's driving the car, David?

251
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:08,979
- What?
- Does it really matter who said what?

252
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:10,179
Of course it matters!

253
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,879
Now, I want to know the particulars
of your wrongdoing.

254
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:15,579
I want to know
how you got what you stole...

255
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,479
...and, of course, where it is now.

256
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:26,979
It's in the Buick.
But I swear to God I didn't touch it.

257
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,979
I swear to God!

258
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:33,779
- All right, then.
- Don't kill me! I don't want you to kill me...

259
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:36,679
- Don't kill me...
- Consider yourself lucky, Del.

260
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,180
Luckier than those "Injuns"
you've got such contempt for.

261
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,679
If anybody got a raw deal,
it was the American Indian.

262
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,579
America has a black mark on its soul
for what happened to them.

263
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,079
I'm glad they've got those casinos.

264
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,078
David... I wish I had good news for you.

265
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:00,379
- I'll come right to the point.

266
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,080
Chloe Jensen has filed charges
of sexual assault against you.

267
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,779
- Fucking Christ, Wesley!

268
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,181
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

269
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,380
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

270
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,181
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You told me to do it!

271
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:44,981
That was to get him to talk, you...

272
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:48,481
Get rid of that fuckin' thing!
Get rid of it!

273
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,681
Then I can forget.

274
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:58,682
Ever feel like something really special
is about to happen to you, Jasmine?

275
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:04,181
Fucking great, Wesley!
Now we don't know where the stuff is!

276
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:07,581
- Well, he said it's in the Buick!
- Which fuckin' Buick?

277
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:10,181
Then, why'd you shoot him?

278
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:14,180
I had to shoot him, Wesley! It was the only
decent thing to do, after you scalped him!

279
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,781
Echoing I just know that there's
something really special out there for me.

280
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,582
Very unprofessional, Wesley!

281
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:27,182
Echoing I don't know
what it is or... who it is.

282
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:32,081
I just know that since Leslie died,
I've had this... feeling.

283
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:39,681
I just know that there's something
really special out there for me.

284
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:44,981
I don't know what it is, I just know
that since Leslie died, I've had this...

285
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,581
...feeling.

286
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:59,382
Betty!

287
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:03,081
Betty!

288
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:10,082
- Can we use this?
- Yeah, hand me that bag.

289
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,482
- Hey, Betty.
- Hi!

290
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:20,382
- Are you OK?
- I'm great.

291
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:25,782
I was wondering if I might be able to ask
some questions about what happened.

292
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:28,582
Well, I saw the whole thing.
It was disgusting.

293
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:31,581
- Really? Did you see who did it?
- Mm-hm.

294
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:32,782
You did? Who was it?

295
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,481
It was Chloe.

296
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:44,082
You guys wanna try not stepping
directly in the evidence, please?

297
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,782
Roy Ostrey!

298
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,982
You and your goddamn police scanner!
I leave here for ten minutes...

299
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:57,582
Betty, I'm sorry about this.

300
00:20:57,582 --> 00:20:59,581
Oh, it's no problem.

301
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,782
Well, bye, everybody.

302
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,181
Nice to see you, Sheriff.

303
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:08,482
Thanks for stopping by!

304
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,781
Where the hell's she goin'?

305
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:19,081
I still don't understand
how you knew Del wasn't lying.

306
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,082
I saw his soul, Wesley.

307
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:25,381
The man was face to face with his God.
Nobody lies in that situation.

308
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:28,582
Your little Geronimo act rattled me,
and I abandoned my instincts.

309
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:30,682
Never abandon your instincts.

310
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:33,682
- I didn't! You gave me a look!
- What fuckin' look?

311
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:37,983
You only got one. You give me this look,
I thought you were done, so I offed him.

312
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:40,482
I wasn't done,
I was just tired of hearing him whine.

313
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:43,782
And you didn't off anybody,
you scalped him.

314
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,882
Jesus, I almost puked, did I tell you that?

315
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:50,281
- So why tell me the fuckin' Indian story?
- What the hell does that mean, Wesley?

316
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:54,882
If I'd told a Ty Cobb story, would you have
beaten him to death with a baseball bat?

317
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,182
You... Goddamn!

318
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,182
Nothin' there. Let's go.

319
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:03,982
- You wanna just leave the cars like this?
- Why not? It'll confuse 'em.

320
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,382
Gotta do something
now you've fucked it up.

321
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:10,182
I didn't fuck nothin' up!
I was just trying to make a statement.

322
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:14,182
Trying to make a statement(!)
Let me tell you something...

323
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:18,682
...in this business, you don't put food
on the table unless the phone rings.

324
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:22,281
The people who get the calls are good.
Not flashy, good.

325
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:25,782
They get in, they get out, nobody knows
a goddamn thing. You understand?

326
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:29,782
Boom, boom, boom.
Three in the head, you know they're dead.

327
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,682
- That's a good motto.
- Well, I'll get you a bumper sticker.

328
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:38,782
You better start believing it.
It's the only statement you need to make.

329
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:43,582
Is this bothering you?

330
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:45,981
- Let's get this thing down.
- Thank you.

331
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,682
Listen.

332
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:52,983
- I questioned Joyce about all this.
- Yeah?

333
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:57,583
Seems she was pretty familiar with old
Del on a regular basis, if you get my drift.

334
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:59,982
And half the other guys in this town,
including yourself, I believe.

335
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,883
Junior year.

336
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:05,683
- Anyway, so what?
- Suppose Betty found out about them?

337
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:12,082
So you're saying that Betty Sizemore,
our Betty Sizemore...

338
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,982
...who you went to swing choir with...

339
00:23:15,382 --> 00:23:19,382
...hired somebody to scalp her husband
in her kitchen while she watched?

340
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,183
- It's just a theory.
- Oh, you're amazing !

341
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:24,482
Just because I'm thinkin' it
doesn't mean I like it.

342
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,484
So? How is she?

343
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,584
She's in a kind of shock.

344
00:23:32,984 --> 00:23:38,184
I see signs of a post-traumatic reaction,
with possible dissociative symptoms.

345
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:42,084
- Could I have that in American?
- It's a kind of altered state.

346
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:44,984
It allows a traumatised person
to continue functioning.

347
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:48,385
- So she did witness it?
- Without question.

348
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,684
But her memory of it has gone.

349
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:52,984
Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?

350
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,484
Night.

351
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:09,284
Sue Ann, I gotta tell you something.

352
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:12,685
A bad thing happened to Del and me.

353
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,884
Yeah, hon.

354
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:17,984
Why don't you get some sleep?
Everything's gonna be fine.

355
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,084
Oh, I know.

356
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,684
And I'm real sorry about all this.

357
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:30,784
But I just know there's something special
out there for me.

358
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:53,985
Dear Del...

359
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:59,084
...this is the hardest thing I've ever done,
but I need to be honest.

360
00:24:59,983 --> 00:25:04,085
Admit it, Del. We've grown apart
and you don't seem happy any more.

361
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:08,186
As for me, I don't think
I've ever given myself a chance.

362
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,085
But I want to take that chance now.

363
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:13,785
Best of luck to you...

364
00:25:13,985 --> 00:25:15,885
...Betty.

365
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:45,285
This is bad, Wesley.
This is very, very bad.

366
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:53,484
- This is extremely bad.
- Mm-hm? Want some bacon?

367
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,685
I don't think you appreciate
the gravity of the situation here.

368
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,085
It's bad enough
that we don't have what we came for.

369
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:01,485
We don't even know where the hell it is.

370
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,085
Now this.

371
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:12,184
This is s'posed to be my last job. I mean,
I even put down a deposit on my boat.

372
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:17,985
How the hell can you eat at a time like
this? I get nauseous just watching you.

373
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:21,385
Well, I can eat
cos I know we didn't kidnap no woman.

374
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:24,685
And I can eat
cos I know ain't nobody lookin' for us.

375
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,984
And I can eat cos I'm fuckin' hungry.

376
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:33,085
Relax. She'll end up on a milk carton
or somethin'. That's about it.

377
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:35,684
She got out of town awful quick.

378
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,984
And wasn't she quiet in that house?

379
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:40,485
Mm-hm.

380
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:43,284
I think most women
would have screamed, don't you?

381
00:26:43,284 --> 00:26:46,185
I know they would have. Yeah.

382
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:48,885
We could be dealing with
a cunning, ruthless woman here.

383
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,686
- Uh, Mrs Rogers?
- Yes.

384
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:56,384
How you doin'?
Dwight Campbell, Mutual Life Insurance.

385
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,785
- I'm looking for a Betty Sizemore.
- I wish I could help you, but I can't.

386
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:05,684
Go to your room. Now.

387
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,484
Precious, ain't they?

388
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:13,286
Y'know, she has a substantial
death benefit coming to her...

389
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:15,386
...from the tragic loss of her husband.

390
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:18,186
- Does she have any relatives in the area?
- No.

391
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:22,785
Well, she does have some grandparents
down in Oklahoma, but that's it.

392
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:27,885
- So are you in touch with Mrs Sizemore?
- No. But I am taping her show for her.

393
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:30,484
- Her show?
- Yeah, A Reason To Love.

394
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:33,284
Did Chloe testify?

395
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:38,985
- And she's been working here how long?
- Oh, five years, give or take.

396
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:42,785
- You two in high school together?

397
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:45,085
Aren't you a sweetheart?

398
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:47,385
No. Not quite.

399
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:52,685
- She's been with us quite a while.
- But she wanted more out of life, huh?

400
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:56,084
No, she just wanted something out of life.
Anything.

401
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,185
Who's this gentleman?

402
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:00,985
It's just a cutout. A gag for her birthday.

403
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:04,685
- Do you mind if I keep these?
- If it'll help bring her back, be my guest.

404
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:33,788
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea
on the phone, Lonnie.

405
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:35,387
Oh, I don't think so, Chloe.

406
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,387
Lonnie When they call you to the stand,
just say what you're supposed to say.

407
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:47,586
You mean I'm going to have to swear?
On a Bible?

408
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:51,587
Relax, it's a hearing. But they are
going to ask you some questions.

409
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:55,587
- Oh, no!
- So, you're into Reason, too?

410
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,587
- Is... David going to be there?
- I'm Ellen. What can I get you?

411
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:01,787
Um, a lite beer, please.

412
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,688
Come on, Chloe.

413
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:07,188
You're a beautiful, intelligent,
sexy woman...

414
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,387
Thank you.

415
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:11,887
...with a torn blouse! You can't lose.

416
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,487
A Reason To Love
will continue after these messages.

417
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,288
- Ellen, do you have a phone?
- Here you go.

418
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:22,088
If it's long-distance, you can
leave me a buck when you're done.

419
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:23,588
Thanks.

420
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:24,688
3.99 for kids! You know you want...

421
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:30,588
Hello?

422
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:32,287
- Sue Ann?
- Betty!

423
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:35,087
Hi, just calling to tell you that I'm fine.

424
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:37,187
- OK, where are you?
- I'm in the...

425
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:40,188
...Canyon Ranch Bar. In, um...

426
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:42,586
- Williams.
- In Williams, Arizona.

427
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:45,387
- So I guess I'm halfway there.
- Halfway to where?

428
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:48,687
You've gotta come home! We've been
really worried about you, y'know.

429
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:53,788
Sue Ann, I thought you'd back me on this.
You know how it is with Del.

430
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:56,388
- How did he take my note?
- Listen to me.

431
00:29:56,488 --> 00:30:00,488
A nice man came by
from Mutual Life Insurance.

432
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:04,288
He says you've got a lot of money
coming to you from Del's policy.

433
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,588
What are you talking about?

434
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,087
Del's life insurance policy.
Are you with me?

435
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:09,687
Oh, I've gotta go.

436
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:12,787
- No, Betty, listen to me. Del is dead!
- What did I ever do to her?

437
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:15,387
It's what you didn't do, bud.

438
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:20,588
Orchestra swells

439
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:26,388
- So where you headed, Betty?
- Los Angeles, California.

440
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:30,787
And you called your friend
and she's telling you not to go?

441
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:34,488
When I went to Europe,
my friends told me I was crazy.

442
00:30:34,488 --> 00:30:39,587
Europe? The Europe?
God, this is my first time out of Kansas!

443
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:42,088
I should call you Dorothy.

444
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:46,988
When I first left here,
I went straight to Italy.

445
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:51,288
Everyone told me not to go,
but, oh, I wanted to go to Rome!

446
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:55,088
Ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn
in Roman Holiday.

447
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,387
Goddammit, I went!

448
00:30:57,387 --> 00:31:02,588
- Did you love it?
- Rome, it was the best thing I ever did.

449
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:04,788
Because I did it!

450
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:08,088
And I swear to you, it changed me.

451
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,987
I've been to Rome, Italy.

452
00:31:11,988 --> 00:31:17,588
I sat every morning in the Caffe Sistina,
and I drank my cappuccino and I...

453
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:20,488
...I watched the pilgrims walk to Mass.

454
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:24,788
No-one can ever take that away from me.

455
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:35,088
I left my husband three days ago.

456
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:38,088
- Really?
- Yeah.

457
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:41,989
I'm getting back with my ex-fiancé.

458
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:47,288
He proposed to me right around here,
so I guess this is a sentimental stop.

459
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,388
Pink Martini. "Whatever Will Be, Will Be
ue Ser, Ser"

460
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:58,188
When I was just a little girl

461
00:31:58,188 --> 00:32:03,688
I asked my mother "What will I be?"

462
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:07,788
"Will I be pretty?"

463
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:10,588
"Will I be rich?"

464
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:14,688
Here's what she said to me.

465
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:19,388
Que sera, sera

466
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,488
Whatever will be...

467
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:26,889
- Isn't this your first time out of Kansas?
- Well, I mean, except for then.

468
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:31,689
I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart
surgeon, so that's not too bad, huh?

469
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:34,288
- That's smooth!

470
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:37,888
- Cedars-Sinai?
- No, no, no. Loma Vista.

471
00:32:42,188 --> 00:32:44,588
I suppose his name is David Ravell?

472
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:46,688
How did you know that?

473
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:48,788
What's his real name?

474
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:51,888
It's Doctor David Ravell.
But how did you know?

475
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:54,889
Do you mean George McCord, the actor?

476
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:58,289
No. No, no, no. David Ravell.

477
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:00,289
He's a heart specialist.

478
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:02,888
I know, we just watched him...

479
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,888
You're serious?

480
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:17,688
How are you gonna find him, Betty?

481
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,588
Well, I'll... I'll go to the hospital.

482
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:24,989
What if when you get there, nothing's
like you thought it was gonna be?

483
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:36,290
Well, this is the biggest thing
that I've ever done.

484
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,690
And I have to do it.

485
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,391
You take care of yourself, Betty.

486
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:52,391
To tell you the truth,
I can't believe I've made it this far.

487
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:07,190
Betty is a big fan of the soap opera
A Reason To Love.

488
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,990
Look, that's important.

489
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,591
Why do I need to look at it?
He told you to do this?

490
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:16,290
No! I saw, on television, Chloe and Lonnie.
They're television characters!

491
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,691
And Betty is in love with Dr David Ravell,
from the show.

492
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:25,091
What if she's in Los Angeles
looking for him? The actor, I mean.

493
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,391
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

494
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:30,590
Dumb? Then why did Betty call Sue Ann
from Arizona yesterday?

495
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,590
- Yeah, she called me yesterday!
- Said she was in Arizona, did she?

496
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,690
- Yes!
- This is even stupider than I thought.

497
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,491
This woman is on the run...

498
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,292
- Come on, Elden!
...you think she'd phone in her location?

499
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:45,091
- Why not call the Los Angeles police?
- You have got to do that!

500
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:47,790
Hey! I'm the law.

501
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:50,390
I ain't gotta do nothin'.

502
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,291
That's Betty when she was 12.

503
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,391
Very graceful.

504
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:18,390
- Perfect form.
- Yeah.

505
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:22,491
Such poise, too. Very impressive.

506
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,590
Thank you, ma'am.

507
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,891
Did she ever give you any indication
that she might leave her husband?

508
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:35,091
She put up with things
that I wouldn't have.

509
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:38,191
And yet, she, of all people, defended him.

510
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,391
That's why what that sheriff said
made me angry.

511
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,591
What do you mean?

512
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:49,991
If anyone paid to have that husband
of hers killed, it would have been me.

513
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,790
Well, Mr and Mrs Blaine...

514
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,290
...I can assure you without a doubt
that your granddaughter's alive.

515
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,791
And she had absolutely nothing to do
with the killing of Del Sizemore.

516
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,591
You've got to be missing
a piece of your soul to kill someone.

517
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:03,791
That's not our Betty.

518
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,891
Why you say you gotta be missin'
a piece of your soul to kill somebody?

519
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,090
Well, because it's not natural, young man.

520
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,091
It's very, very natural to kill.
All species kill.

521
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:14,790
See, God kills.

522
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,191
You sayin' that God's
missin' a piece of his soul?

523
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:22,491
My partner's young, Mr Blaine.
He loves his job. Loves his job.

524
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:25,391
Matter of fact,
he'd like to kill all the criminals himself.

525
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,791
Let me just ask you this.

526
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:34,090
If Betty was running from someone,
where do you think she'd go?

527
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,891
A Reason To Love theme

528
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:45,891
chief nurse Of course, I don't know
every doctor that works here.

529
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,192
But Dr Ravell is the finest surgeon
on the staff.

530
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,292
You must know him.

531
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,991
He's really handsome,
and he's gentle, and considerate.

532
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:58,691
- He's being sued for sexual assault.
- What?

533
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:01,591
Well, he didn't do it. He was set up.

534
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:05,990
Well,
I certainly would have heard about that.

535
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:10,591
Of course, he's only here twice a week.
He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.

536
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:12,291
I don't think I know that hospital.

537
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,691
Oh, it's the one in the really pretty area...

538
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,092
...with the palm trees out front
and the mountains in the back.

539
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,691
You've just described
all of Southern California.

540
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:27,591
I'm sorry, but I can't even consider you
without references and a résumé.

541
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:31,190
And frankly, I don't know how
you could have forgotten them.

542
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:37,590
- Central, reply to 3359, please.

543
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,491
- Reply to 3359.
- Oh...

544
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:46,191
Oh...

545
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,691
Hi.

546
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,691
Who... who are you?

547
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,491
Betty.

548
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,591
Nurse Betty.

549
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,192
Right this way, gentlemen!

550
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:26,691
Hold it!

551
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,892
- Salgamos afuera!

552
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:39,093
- Wait, Richie, wait!
- Hacia atrás!

553
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:46,893
- Somebody, please! Somebody!
- Párate!

554
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,493
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!

555
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,893
You've got to help me!
I have my brother, he's dying!

556
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:57,393
Hacia atrás!
A dónde vas? Dónde vas?

557
00:39:00,394 --> 00:39:03,893
- Freeze! Drop your gun!
- Sí! Viva la raza! Qué piensas, eh?

558
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:07,393
- I said, drop your weapon!
- Hi.

559
00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:14,794
- Let's see. Are you choking?

560
00:39:14,794 --> 00:39:16,394
OK. Let me look.

561
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:19,193
Oh, I think he has the... He has the thingy!

562
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,993
- What does he have?
- The... the air in the wound!

563
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,494
He has too much air
around the heart and the lungs...

564
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:27,495
...so I have to open... I have to...

565
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:30,193
I have to relieve the pressure
so he can breathe.

566
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:31,894
OK, here we go.

567
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:35,993
- What are you doing? You'll hurt him!
- No, I have to do this, or he'll die!

568
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:38,994
It's OK, I've seen it done once.
Here we go. Ready?

569
00:39:41,994 --> 00:39:43,894
See? Wasn't so bad.

570
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:52,594
- Is he gonna be all right?
- We'll do everything we can for him.

571
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:56,493
You should thank that nurse
for what she did.

572
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:06,894
Iris, who was that remarkable nurse?

573
00:40:09,393 --> 00:40:11,993
What you did yesterday
was reckless at best.

574
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,893
You are not an employee of this hospital.

575
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:17,393
If that boy dies, I don't even want
to think about the lawsuit that will follow.

576
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:20,893
- Are we communicating here?
- Yes, ma'am.

577
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,493
Good.
Because I'm prepared to offer you a job.

578
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,894
You can help out in the pharmacy...

579
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,294
...until your California certification
and references arrive...

580
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:34,393
. but you are not to touch anyone.
Is that totally clear?

581
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:43,195
Well, he's doing fine!

582
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,295
Ah, thank God.

583
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,294
You don't sound like you're from here.

584
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,793
No, I'm from Kansas. I just drove in.

585
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:53,694
Oh. Why did you come to LA?

586
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:58,194
I came for love.
My ex-fiancé lives here, so...

587
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:02,394
So, are you staying with him?

588
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:05,893
Oh, no. I don't actually know
where he is just yet...

589
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:08,594
...so I'm at a motel around the corner.

590
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:23,794
- This neighbourhood. You get used to it.

591
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:27,094
- Oh! Pretty.
- Yeah, I got this apartment with a guy.

592
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,093
Oh, the guy you were telling me about?

593
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:32,094
Oh, no. This one was worse.

594
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:35,395
I had to have the place sprayed
when he left. Twice.

595
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:39,595
He was... two before the last one,
not counting a little office thing in there...

596
00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:42,594
...which I'm trusting you with
because if it gets out...

597
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:44,694
...I'm on the street, know what I'm sayin'?

598
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:49,894
Oh! Oh, wow!

599
00:41:50,793 --> 00:41:52,794
This is nice!

600
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,094
Oh, I love the aquarium.

601
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:59,494
Yeah, well,
at least fish don't pee on the seat.

602
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:04,894
Just once, I wish I'd run into a guy
who would notice them before my tits!

603
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:08,494
- Come on, I will show you to your room.
- OK.

604
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:14,894
No, no, no! We'll... we'll find her.

605
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:18,294
- Yes.

606
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:21,194
I understand.

607
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:24,594
- So what did they say?
- They said find it.

608
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:28,295
Find her.
Finish the job we were paid to do.

609
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:31,095
- Half.
- What?

610
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:33,494
Well, they only paid us half,
so they still owe us the other half.

611
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:36,394
Oh, goddamn, Wesley.
There you go again!

612
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:40,594
The same lousy-assed attitude
that got us here in the first place!

613
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:42,694
That "make a statement...

614
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:46,294
...do an end-zone dance, shake your ass
and sue everybody in sight" attitude...

615
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:49,694
...that's draggin' this whole fuckin' country
down the drain!

616
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:52,194
You get paid when a job is done!

617
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,595
- And we haven't done the goddamn job!
- I know that.

618
00:42:54,595 --> 00:42:56,294
Turn off that goddamn music!

619
00:42:57,295 --> 00:42:58,695
- Do I deserve this?

620
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:01,794
In the twilight of my career,
do I deserve this?

621
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:05,195
I don't think so. I never took out anybody
that didn't have it coming.

622
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:07,494
I'm a fuckin' professional!

623
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:09,594
And where am I? Purgatory!

624
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:11,694
Worse. You're in Texas.

625
00:43:11,795 --> 00:43:12,895
I am very tired.

626
00:43:12,994 --> 00:43:17,294
I've worked hard,
and my work should be over. But it's not.

627
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:22,595
This fuckin' job is just beginning.

628
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:35,494
Betty, Betty, Betty.

629
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:39,694
What's goin' through
that pretty little head of yours?

630
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:45,196
Everyone says
if you wanna get married...

631
00:43:45,495 --> 00:43:48,097
...this is the spot to find someone.

632
00:43:48,197 --> 00:43:50,097
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

633
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:54,297
Luckily for me, I'm off men,
so I have the luxury of not giving a shit.

634
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:59,296
Y'know, the more I think about it,
David probably wouldn't come here.

635
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:01,597
I mean, he's still getting over Leslie
and everything.

636
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:03,697
- Who is Leslie?
- His wife.

637
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:07,197
- He has a wife?
- Had. She died in a car wreck last year.

638
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,996
- Decapitated.
- God, that's awful.

639
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:13,497
I know. They're not even sure it was an
accident cos they never found her head.

640
00:44:13,598 --> 00:44:15,296
- Her head?
- Mm-hm.

641
00:44:15,397 --> 00:44:17,396
- You are making this up.
- Oh, no, no.

642
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:20,897
She was having an affair
with the Russian diplomat...

643
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:23,697
...and they think he was mixed up
in the Mafia or something.

644
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:27,897
Ay, Dios!
And I thought my love life was crazy.

645
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:31,995
So we'll start at the library first
and we'll fan out from there.

646
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:36,397
They've got all the LA phone books,
plus medical directories, things like that.

647
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:39,796
We're not gonna let him
hide from you any longer, right?

648
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:41,797
All right!

649
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:46,796
I am going to make this
my personal mission.

650
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:50,096
I can't believe
you're doing all this for me, Rosa.

651
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:55,496
I just wanna make sure that you get
your... fairy-tale ending, or whatever.

652
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:57,997
At least one of us should.

653
00:44:58,096 --> 00:44:59,496
Thank you.

654
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,896
You're welcome.

655
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:16,497
Hi!

656
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:18,096
Guess who I saw today.

657
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:20,896
- Who?
- Dr David Ravell.

658
00:46:20,996 --> 00:46:22,697
You're kidding! Where?

659
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:24,497
On television.

660
00:46:24,497 --> 00:46:27,397
- Really?
- Cut the shit, will you?

661
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:30,497
Either you're making a fool out of me
because you get off on it...

662
00:46:30,597 --> 00:46:33,197
...or you got some serious problems.
So which one is it, Betty?

663
00:46:33,197 --> 00:46:34,797
What are you talking about, Rosa?

664
00:46:34,898 --> 00:46:37,097
I'm talking about...

665
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:39,397
...Dr David Ravell!

666
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,997
I know, I heard you, but I...

667
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:44,497
You have a thing for an actor
on some stupid white soap opera...

668
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,597
...and we searched all over town
for his character!

669
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:49,898
Not the actor, whose real name is George,
by the way, but his character, Betty!

670
00:46:57,797 --> 00:47:00,297
Are you having a nervous breakdown?

671
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:06,497
- Oh, Rosa.
- I trusted you. I thought he was real.

672
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:09,797
- He is real.
- You need serious help.

673
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:18,197
Bet she's nice and comfortable
in that air-conditioned car right now.

674
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:24,497
You don't look all that comfortable here,
though, baby.

675
00:47:24,497 --> 00:47:28,096
You don't like being
the centre of attention, do you?

676
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:30,297
Nah. You're like me.

677
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:32,498
- You been smokin'?
- Huh?

678
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:34,797
What's wrong wit' you?

679
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:37,996
What the fuck? Wesley!

680
00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:41,998
That was a shitty thing to do!

681
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:44,898
I'm sick of seein' her fucking face!

682
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:50,897
I will shoot that bitch
like she'd scratched my car!

683
00:47:51,098 --> 00:47:53,198
Do not talk like that.

684
00:47:54,897 --> 00:47:56,898
My last one.

685
00:47:58,397 --> 00:48:00,498
My final target.

686
00:48:01,997 --> 00:48:05,997
Hey. Don't you realise that you're special?

687
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:10,498
Huh?
Don't you know you represent somethin'?

688
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:12,198
- What?
- What?

689
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:13,797
What does she represent?

690
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:16,297
What's some skinny white bitch
from Kansas...

691
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:18,998
...who's draggin' our ass
up and down the Louisiana Purchase...

692
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:23,697
...what does she represent?
Please tell me. Please.

693
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:28,097
I don't know.

694
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:30,597
Something.

695
00:48:31,197 --> 00:48:32,697
Charlie!

696
00:48:32,697 --> 00:48:35,897
They found her in Vegas!
Perfect description!

697
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,798
Says she's with the buyer
that Del lined up.

698
00:48:37,997 --> 00:48:40,598
How'd they describe her?

699
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:42,698
You know, blonde, thin, whatever.

700
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:45,197
Well, now. Blonde, thin, yeah.

701
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:48,400
Did they say anything about style?
Did they mention grace?

702
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,699
Huh? Huh?

703
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,800
Hey.

704
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:31,100
Hey.

705
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,000
This is crazy.
I come home, you go to your room...

706
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,400
...you go to the kitchen, I go to my room.

707
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,999
It's stupid.

708
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:44,500
So what do you say?
Can... can we be friends?

709
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,999
All right.

710
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,600
What are those?

711
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,499
Hey, look! Look!

712
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,499
We don't have time
to look at some hole in the ground.

713
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,500
I'm talkin' about one of the seven
natural wonders of the world here.

714
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,000
It'd get dark before you got there.

715
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,999
You wanna see the Grand Canyon
at night?

716
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,099
That shit ain't grand, it's bland!

717
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:15,599
- What the hell does it matter?
- We could be in Vegas in four hours.

718
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:17,699
- Shit! She wasn't in Kansas City.
- I know.

719
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:19,200
She wasn't in Dallas or Houston, either!

720
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,600
What makes you think she'll be in Vegas?

721
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,199
Think she's gonna be waitin' there
with tassels on her titties?

722
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:26,200
- No.
- Listen.

723
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,800
"When I grow up, I am going to
become a nurse or a veterinarian."

724
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,700
"I always wanted to help people
and value all life...

725
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,399
...be it animal, plant or mineral."
Does that sound like a showgirl to you?

726
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:44,400
Keep turnin' the pages. I'm sure she
blows a few strangers before it's done.

727
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,800
- Do you hear yourself?
- What?

728
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,700
You sound like a fuckin' madman!

729
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,800
- Are you an American, Wesley?
- Yes, I'm an American.

730
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,699
And no,
I'm not going to the fuckin' Bland Canyon!

731
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:59,401
Country and western

732
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,099
You don't know what you're missing!

733
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Asshole.

734
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:16,300
- Whassup?
- Mr Campbell?

735
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,501
Huh? What?

736
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,301
Is this Mutual Life Insurance?

737
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,199
- Hello? Hello?
- Yeah, yeah. This is Dwight Campbell.

738
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:28,800
My name's Sue Ann Rogers. I'm Betty
Sizemore's friend. I've heard from her.

739
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,500
- Yeah?
- She was at a bar in Arizona.

740
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,799
"Don't You Know"

741
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:41,100
Don't you know

742
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:46,401
I was yours from the very day

743
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,899
That you happened to come my way?

744
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:58,400
Can't you see

745
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,301
I'm under your spell

746
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:10,801
By the look in my eyes?

747
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,901
Can't you tell?

748
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:15,700
Can't you tell?

749
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:23,399
Now, don't you know

750
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,599
- Every beat of my heart
- Uh-huh. Thank you.

751
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:29,901
Keeps crying out?

752
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:31,300
What the fuck?

753
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:32,801
I want you so

754
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,101
- Don't you know?
- C'mere!

755
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:58,501
Did you have a good time?

756
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:02,801
Did you make a wish,
get in touch with your blackness?

757
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,201
Found your Betty.

758
00:53:05,201 --> 00:53:08,200
Well, at least
where she's been hangin' out.

759
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,500
Where? Where is she?

760
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:12,600
I'm not tellin' you.

761
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,200
- What?
- I'm not tellin' you till you straighten up.

762
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,200
Dancin' round
like fuckin' Bojangles out there, you...

763
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,001
What the fuck?
This shit's gotta stop, and I mean it!

764
00:53:51,203 --> 00:53:53,603
Do you think we should go and sit?

765
00:53:53,702 --> 00:53:58,003
Uh, no, I was thinking we could just
stay out here for a little while...

766
00:53:58,003 --> 00:54:01,102
...mingle a little bit.
- OK.

767
00:54:07,603 --> 00:54:10,402
Well, I'm glad to be here.
Oh, sure, absolutely.

768
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,604
Look who's here.

769
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:15,203
Over there.

770
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:22,003
Well?

771
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:26,002
What are you waiting for?

772
00:54:26,002 --> 00:54:30,003
Talk to him, huh?
You came 1,500 miles for this.

773
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:57,303
- You're serious about it?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

774
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:00,202
He's got his own company.
He's the guy you want on your team.

775
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:02,402
- On your team ?
- I want you to meet him.

776
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:05,202
Because everybody's
gonna say "I can't..."

777
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:10,302
- Do I know you?
- Of course. Don't you remember?

778
00:55:10,302 --> 00:55:12,003
I take it I should.

779
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:15,503
Silly! It's me!

780
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,602
We were engaged.

781
00:55:19,602 --> 00:55:21,402
You were engaged?

782
00:55:22,203 --> 00:55:25,403
I - I beg your pardon?

783
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:30,302
Letting you go -
that was the biggest mistake of my life.

784
00:55:30,502 --> 00:55:34,803
And it's a mistake I've had to live with for
six years, but I've put it behind me now.

785
00:55:34,904 --> 00:55:38,603
And I just hope
that you can put it behind you, too.

786
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,503
I've missed you.

787
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,203
I've missed you, David.

788
00:55:48,503 --> 00:55:50,802
That's... very nice.

789
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:53,102
- That was very good.
- Greatly appreciate that.

790
00:55:53,102 --> 00:55:56,002
Wow. That was... Wow!

791
00:55:56,402 --> 00:55:59,003
The day I left you, I just drove and drove.

792
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:02,803
I drove all day and all that night,
I just kept driving.

793
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:05,903
I stopped at this old country church...

794
00:56:06,003 --> 00:56:09,302
...and the pastor let me in.
And I sat...

795
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:12,203
In the very first pew, where
we would have sat on our wedding day.

796
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:17,903
I can't believe I remembered that!
Although I mean I should, I wrote it.

797
00:56:18,002 --> 00:56:23,102
But that was seven years ago,
and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm...

798
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:25,404
...flattered, I think.

799
00:56:25,404 --> 00:56:27,804
Or frightened. One or the other.

800
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:31,804
- What's your name?
- Betty Sizemore. What do you write?

801
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:34,502
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the producer.

802
00:56:34,502 --> 00:56:35,703
Uh-huh?

803
00:56:35,803 --> 00:56:39,402
- I have to admit you had me going there.

804
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:42,603
You're better than most of them, anyway.
Do you have a head shot?

805
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,703
Wait a second.
So what happens next, Betty?

806
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,002
Are you sure you... Well, why not?

807
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:50,503
What... what does happen next, Betty?

808
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:56,004
Well, David came out to, uh, do his
residency, and then he met Leslie...

809
00:56:56,004 --> 00:57:01,403
No, no, no. We know all that. We want
to know what happened to you, Betty.

810
00:57:01,403 --> 00:57:04,303
Oh. Oh. Well...

811
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:08,503
...I married a car salesman.

812
00:57:09,203 --> 00:57:11,103
Really?

813
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:14,803
You were dumped for a car salesman,
George. A car salesman.

814
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:17,704
- Why'd you call him George?
- Why did I call him...?

815
00:57:17,704 --> 00:57:20,303
Yeah, David.
Tell us about the car salesman !

816
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:26,303
Oh, right. Right. Well, you are, um,
you're talking about, uh...

817
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:27,803
...Fred, there.

818
00:57:28,204 --> 00:57:30,803
- Del.
- Del. Del. Yeah.

819
00:57:30,903 --> 00:57:33,204
Uh, Del, he was amazing.

820
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:36,603
He was... I mean, this guy,
talk about salesmen...

821
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:41,103
...he could sell anything to anybody
at any time. Amazing.

822
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:42,202
You know Del?

823
00:57:42,403 --> 00:57:45,304
I don't know how to tell you this,
but Del and I go way back.

824
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:47,203
We went to school together.

825
00:57:47,304 --> 00:57:49,204
As a matter of fact...

826
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:51,203
...he saved my life.

827
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:53,003
Oh, my gosh.

828
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:55,403
Like, two more minutes
in that freezing cold water...

829
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:57,803
...and I swear to God
I would have drowned but...

830
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:03,403
Del...

831
00:58:03,403 --> 00:58:08,004
Del jumped in, and he grabbed me,
and he just... he pulled me out.

832
00:58:09,104 --> 00:58:13,004
He was amazing.
Hold on. I'm having a moment here.

833
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:18,403
I lost touch with him after that,
but... I still owe him.

834
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:23,403
He never said anything.
That is unbelievable!

835
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:26,903
- Funny. That's just what I was thinking.
- I know!

836
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,602
I can't tell you how much it hurt me
to hear that you married him.

837
00:58:30,804 --> 00:58:32,703
Oh, I'm so sorry.

838
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:35,404
I tried to tell myself at first
it was for the best.

839
00:58:35,603 --> 00:58:39,204
That there was some sort of reason for it,
but Del?

840
00:58:39,204 --> 00:58:42,603
I was young.
And... and stupid, and scared.

841
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:44,504
You never even gave us a chance.

842
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,504
I know.

843
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:51,103
I can't tell you how many times
I tell myself that same thing.

844
00:58:55,005 --> 00:59:00,004
Are you really crying right now?
I'm just... I was just kinda playing along.

845
00:59:00,105 --> 00:59:03,106
What are you...?
What are you doing, George?

846
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:07,006
Why does he keep calling you George?

847
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:09,205
I don't know.

848
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:11,006
Listen...

849
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:13,606
Betty? I'm sure you'll understand...

850
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:17,705
...David is a very busy man,
so we really have to go.

851
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,706
Now.

852
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:22,305
It was a pleasure meeting you.

853
00:59:22,305 --> 00:59:25,205
We've got to get to this, uh,
previous engagement.

854
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:29,606
- Oh.
- But... it was good. It was so great.

855
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:32,506
All right.

856
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:42,305
I would be honoured if you'd join us.

857
00:59:42,406 --> 00:59:44,306
What...

858
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:45,605
...an idea.

859
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:48,606
I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

860
00:59:48,606 --> 00:59:50,605
David!

861
00:59:50,706 --> 00:59:54,606
- Yeah?
- All right.

862
01:00:05,506 --> 01:00:08,506
- Thank you.
- Hold on a minute! Thank you.

863
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,306
- Hey, thanks, man. I love your work.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot.

864
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,305
Hey, look who's here!

865
01:00:18,505 --> 01:00:20,706
What's Lonnie doing here?

866
01:00:20,807 --> 01:00:24,206
- What happened to you?
- Late, as usual.

867
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:27,606
I know. Why are you guys leaving?

868
01:00:27,705 --> 01:00:29,606
We did our 20 minutes.

869
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:31,806
Who's the skirt?

870
01:00:35,606 --> 01:00:38,405
Apparently somebody who doesn't like
to be referred to as a skirt.

871
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,306
You!

872
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,305
Relax, she didn't even get you that hard.

873
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:47,407
- Do I know you?
- No. But I know just who you are.

874
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:20,406
This doesn't look like the kind of place
Betty would come to.

875
01:01:20,506 --> 01:01:24,605
Maybe she had to go to the bathroom ?
She does pee, doesn't she ?

876
01:01:24,605 --> 01:01:27,006
Or is she too poised to pee?

877
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:29,706
Hey. Be careful with that.

878
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:38,306
...that hastened at my call

879
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:41,106
But when I met that little girl

880
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:43,706
I knew that I would fall

881
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,407
Poor little fool, oh yeah

882
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:50,806
I was a fool, uh-huh...

883
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:54,005
What can I get you?

884
01:01:56,105 --> 01:01:57,906
We're federal marshals, ma'am.

885
01:01:59,605 --> 01:02:02,505
We're looking for this young lady.

886
01:02:05,207 --> 01:02:07,307
I haven't seen her.

887
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,407
You sure have.

888
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,006
- Shut up, Merle.
- Betty!

889
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:13,006
Her name is Betty.

890
01:02:13,906 --> 01:02:16,606
I've never seen that woman before.
Neither has Merle. He drinks too much.

891
01:02:18,006 --> 01:02:20,806
And don't try to tell me you're cops.

892
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:25,206
I was married to a cop for nine years.
You're not cops.

893
01:02:25,706 --> 01:02:26,906
Motherfuck!

894
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:31,006
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

895
01:02:31,307 --> 01:02:33,006
You haven't been forthcoming with us.

896
01:02:35,507 --> 01:02:37,607
So Lyla's very nice!

897
01:02:39,406 --> 01:02:41,506
Really tall.

898
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:45,206
Yes, she is.

899
01:02:45,906 --> 01:02:50,406
Y'know, she said she thought
that I was charming and relentless.

900
01:02:50,406 --> 01:02:53,206
She said that I would go far in this town.

901
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:59,507
Oh, and that unlike most charming
and relentless people she knew...

902
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:01,607
...she liked me.

903
01:03:03,106 --> 01:03:05,507
Well, she's a good person to know.

904
01:03:06,006 --> 01:03:07,806
So...

905
01:03:08,106 --> 01:03:10,706
...where did you study again?

906
01:03:10,706 --> 01:03:13,106
- Carlton.
- Carlton.

907
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:15,507
Carlton School of Nursing.

908
01:03:17,406 --> 01:03:20,407
But I only went for two semesters, though.

909
01:03:20,407 --> 01:03:23,207
- Because Del...
- Ah, right. OK, OK. OK.

910
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:27,007
I think you set the official record
for staying in character...

911
01:03:27,007 --> 01:03:29,007
...about three hours ago now.

912
01:03:29,107 --> 01:03:33,407
You just said that to me two hours ago.

913
01:03:36,606 --> 01:03:38,207
Oh...

914
01:03:38,207 --> 01:03:40,506
- Is it here?
- Uh-huh.

915
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:42,706
Oh, great. Now.

916
01:03:43,006 --> 01:03:47,305
Gosh, I haven't been this happy
since I was 12.

917
01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:52,707
OK, I'll bite.
What happened when you were 12?

918
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:55,707
I took my mom to Kansas City
for Mother's Day...

919
01:03:55,806 --> 01:03:59,009
...and I used the allowance I was saving.

920
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:00,708
We went to lunch at Skies...

921
01:04:00,808 --> 01:04:03,308
...this restaurant
at the top of a building...

922
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:07,108
...and you can see the whole world
from up there.

923
01:04:07,908 --> 01:04:10,308
It was our last special day.

924
01:04:10,408 --> 01:04:12,508
Cos she died that year.

925
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:17,909
It was a great day.

926
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:25,109
You just gave me goosebumps from that,
you know that?

927
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:29,109
That is just great improv.

928
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:31,809
I just want everything
to be perfect between us.

929
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:35,309
I know, I know.
Listen, let's... let's... Time, here.

930
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:38,808
Let's... Can we talk seriously for...

931
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,908
...just a minute?

932
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:45,208
- Uh-huh.
- I know how much you want this, Betty...

933
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:49,009
...and you are gifted
and extremely determined.

934
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:52,509
But I gotta tell you,
it is not entirely up to me.

935
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,708
I know. It's up to us.

936
01:05:08,209 --> 01:05:10,409
I love you, David.

937
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,008
And I want to see you tomorrow,
and the next day...

938
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:17,609
...and the next day, and the next.

939
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:34,009
So were you with him this whole time?

940
01:05:34,109 --> 01:05:36,110
Oh, you scared me.

941
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,209
Mm-hm.

942
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:39,109
Still in love?

943
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:40,809
Mm-hm.

944
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,808
This isn't fair, you know?
Do you always get what you want?

945
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:48,009
Almost never.

946
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:50,508
I mean, you're in love
with someone who doesn't exist.

947
01:05:50,508 --> 01:05:53,308
You come out here, you meet this guy
who should laugh in your face...

948
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:54,808
...and instead you leave with him.

949
01:05:56,508 --> 01:05:59,510
You're like... one of a kind.

950
01:06:00,109 --> 01:06:01,109
Thanks.

951
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:06,610
It was a totally rejuvenating,
spiritual experience.

952
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:07,809
I know. I was there.

953
01:06:07,908 --> 01:06:11,209
I'm not denying that she's good.
Thank you, Lupita.

954
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:13,809
You know she got a job as a nurse?

955
01:06:13,909 --> 01:06:15,909
Method actress?

956
01:06:16,108 --> 01:06:19,908
David Ravell... is getting boring.

957
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:21,308
We know that.

958
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:24,409
Well, couldn't I have, like, a sister...

959
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:27,310
who's a... a twin, who's evil...?

960
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:31,209
No! We did that with Lonnie.
Remember the blind one last year?

961
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:34,009
- And he got the Emmy thing for that?
- Yeah.

962
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:40,309
I think we just bring Betty down, throw
her into the set and see what happens.

963
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:46,309
- I don't know.
- I'd tell the cast. They'd all be prepped.

964
01:06:47,608 --> 01:06:49,709
- I'll think about it.
- It'd be like live television.

965
01:06:49,808 --> 01:06:52,210
I mean, let's live on the edge
a little bit here!

966
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,709
Come on, Lyla!
We could break the mould.

967
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:56,209
I said I'll think about it.

968
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:22,009
Now, let me tell you
why I know she's lying.

969
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:26,610
First place,
Betty would never fall for a soap star.

970
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,610
It's beneath her.

971
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,410
I don't know,
that bartender sounded very serious.

972
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,910
No, Betty's here on business.

973
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,709
It's the biggest market
for what she's selling.

974
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:39,009
Wait, wait. Hold up, hold up.
That don't make no sense!

975
01:07:39,108 --> 01:07:40,309
What doesn't make any sense?

976
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:43,408
Well, you obviously believed the lady!
Shit, we're all the way here in LA!

977
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:46,410
So you believed her enough
to come the fuck out here!

978
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:49,709
If you believed her that much, why is
the rest of her story suddenly bullshit?

979
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:52,210
- I just don't buy it.
- Don't buy it !

980
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:55,010
Call it instinct. Call it 35 years
of professional know-how.

981
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,810
I call it nutty as my shit
after I eat an Almond Roca.

982
01:07:57,909 --> 01:08:00,809
You need to remember
who you're talking to.

983
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:02,409
I need to get my fuckin' head examined!

984
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:05,609
You can't rule something out
just cos you got a whim...

985
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:07,609
...or you thought the bitch was fine!

986
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:10,010
I been followin' your whims
all across America!

987
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,010
- And y'know what? I am fuckin' tired!
- Wesley...

988
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,310
It's beneath her?

989
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:17,910
The bitch is a fuckin' housewife!
Ain't nothin' beneath her!

990
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:24,210
So check this out.
What kind of car does Jasmine drive?

991
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,109
Uh, Mercedes, I think. Black.

992
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:29,509
So is she as fine in real life
as she is on the show?

993
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:32,708
- Better.
- Mm! Goddamn.

994
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,109
Why don't you help a brother
sneak on the lot?

995
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,610
Sure.

996
01:08:39,809 --> 01:08:43,010
- Good lookin' out, baby. Good lookin' out.
- Hey, man.

997
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:47,510
Black Mercedes.
Lookin' for a black Mercedes.

998
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:51,310
She's got ten kilos.

999
01:08:51,509 --> 01:08:53,709
Blonde, great figure.

1000
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,309
Sort of a wholesome Doris Day thing
going on.

1001
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,210
Yeah, that's what I said, Doris Day.

1002
01:09:02,611 --> 01:09:07,412
Yeah, you could see her working
at the UN or someplace like that.

1003
01:09:08,112 --> 01:09:10,112
UN.

1004
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,611
United Nations, man.
Where it's... Never mind.

1005
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,611
Hi. Betty there?

1006
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:29,812
You don't look like you do on TV.

1007
01:09:34,612 --> 01:09:38,311
And you must be Rosa.
I'm George McCord.

1008
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:49,212
Well, I've heard
so many great things about you.

1009
01:09:49,312 --> 01:09:50,712
Not as much as I've heard about you.

1010
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:54,311
These are for you.

1011
01:10:03,112 --> 01:10:05,111
Hi.

1012
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:07,511
Oh, that's nice!

1013
01:10:08,112 --> 01:10:11,312
- Well, I see you've met David.
- Yeah, I sure did.

1014
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:14,912
Funny thing, Betty,
he introduced himself to me as George.

1015
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:17,811
Oh, yeah. He does that.

1016
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:21,913
Half the people who know him
call him George.

1017
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:29,112
I don't think your friend Rosa
likes me very much.

1018
01:10:29,112 --> 01:10:32,312
- Oh, she's probably just jealous.
- Oh.

1019
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:35,012
She gets a little confused about men.

1020
01:10:35,112 --> 01:10:37,212
Um, so where are we going?

1021
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,911
Well, first I was thinking about Patina,
and then I thought about The lvy...

1022
01:10:41,012 --> 01:10:45,612
...and then I thought about someplace
a little more romantic. Like my place.

1023
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:48,712
Oh, great!
We're going to the beach house.

1024
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:51,212
No, I don't live at the beach.

1025
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:52,713
David...

1026
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:56,612
No, I moved to the hills.
I moved.

1027
01:10:57,812 --> 01:11:02,312
God, I haven't felt like this
since I was with Stella Adler in New York.

1028
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:05,612
You're just... you're... you're so real.

1029
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:10,711
I don't think you've ever mentioned
a Stella to me before.

1030
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:13,713
- Oh, haven't I ?
- Uh-uh.

1031
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:16,812
See, I would remember the name Stella.

1032
01:11:16,812 --> 01:11:20,612
The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.

1033
01:11:20,612 --> 01:11:22,613
So was that before Leslie?

1034
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,611
Before us?

1035
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:28,312
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.

1036
01:11:29,713 --> 01:11:33,111
Well, that's why
we're meant to be together.

1037
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:37,512
Your dedication scares me.

1038
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:41,913
Well, it's easy to be dedicated
when you care about something.

1039
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:48,612
When I met you, it was like a warm breeze
had suddenly blown into my life.

1040
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:53,913
You remember that line?
I said that to Leslie during her funeral.

1041
01:11:54,012 --> 01:11:56,112
I love that line.

1042
01:11:56,611 --> 01:11:58,612
Well...

1043
01:11:59,512 --> 01:12:01,711
...you said it to her...

1044
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:06,412
...but you meant it for me, didn't you?

1045
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,413
Yeah.

1046
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:16,013
Maybe I did.

1047
01:12:41,212 --> 01:12:43,712
So I'm walkin' down
Hollywood Boulevard...

1048
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:46,912
...checkin' out the stars on the ground,
y'know, Clint Eastwood, Rock Hudson...

1049
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:50,212
...no people of race, not one fucking...
I could not find people of race anywhere!

1050
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:53,113
So I'm lookin' at this Chinese guy, right,
and he's reading his paper...

1051
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:57,414
...and who do I see? That's Lonnie,
the main prick from the show.

1052
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,914
And who is that next to him? Betty!
I told you this ain't no coincidence!

1053
01:13:07,312 --> 01:13:09,312
What the fuck?
You been holdin' out on me?

1054
01:13:09,413 --> 01:13:11,013
This just does not fit her profile.

1055
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:13,313
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!

1056
01:13:13,313 --> 01:13:15,213
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1057
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:18,712
Betty would not be here because of
a soap opera. Not a soap-opera man!

1058
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:21,512
- That would make her...
- That would make her crazy!

1059
01:13:21,613 --> 01:13:24,013
No shit, Shaft!
And you ain't too far behind yourself!

1060
01:13:24,113 --> 01:13:26,013
No, no. Betty's smarter than that!

1061
01:13:26,013 --> 01:13:28,813
How the fuck did you stay on this job
so fuckin' long?

1062
01:13:28,813 --> 01:13:31,013
There you are, draggin' our ass
up and down the country!

1063
01:13:31,113 --> 01:13:34,613
Meanwhile, our answer to our prayers
are right in your back fucking pocket!

1064
01:13:34,713 --> 01:13:37,412
You let this cunt fuck up my...

1065
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:39,713
Don't you talk to Betty that way!

1066
01:13:39,812 --> 01:13:44,012
I don't care what she turns out to be, don't
you use that term again! You hear me?

1067
01:13:45,112 --> 01:13:47,612
- You need therapy.
- Do you understand?

1068
01:13:47,812 --> 01:13:52,013
Yes, I understand!
Now let go of my vest, you're stretchin' it!

1069
01:13:58,213 --> 01:14:00,613
You made your point.

1070
01:14:08,815 --> 01:14:10,814
Get yourself ready.

1071
01:14:10,915 --> 01:14:14,114
Get ready?
Shit, I been ready since Oklahoma!

1072
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:15,414
Get ready !

1073
01:14:16,616 --> 01:14:18,115
Ready for what?

1074
01:14:31,815 --> 01:14:35,514
- How much longer ?
- Not much. Here we go.

1075
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:39,714
There's nothing in front of you. Relax.
Hold on, you've got a little step there.

1076
01:14:39,814 --> 01:14:42,216
You're fine. You're fine. All right, all set?

1077
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:45,215
- Uh-huh.
- Here we go. And...

1078
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,816
...surprise.

1079
01:14:49,315 --> 01:14:52,015
Loma Vista. Da-dah!

1080
01:14:52,015 --> 01:14:55,514
You didn't tell me
I was going to meet your friends.

1081
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,415
Guess what?
You got the job. And I'm directing.

1082
01:14:59,515 --> 01:15:02,315
- Oh, but I'm at LA County.
- Oh, are you ?

1083
01:15:02,315 --> 01:15:04,315
Come on. Uh, it's only four lines...

1084
01:15:04,414 --> 01:15:06,314
...so I thought I'd just kinda
spring it on you. I hope that's OK.

1085
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:08,515
All right, we're not going to do
any blocking or anything like that.

1086
01:15:08,615 --> 01:15:10,615
I'm just going to put you here
near the nurses' station.

1087
01:15:10,615 --> 01:15:12,815
OK, I'll be right there, OK? Thanks.

1088
01:15:12,815 --> 01:15:15,215
And I just want to do, like,
a quick run-through, all right?

1089
01:15:15,215 --> 01:15:18,015
Relax, you look great.
And here we go in a sec. Hold on.

1090
01:15:24,015 --> 01:15:26,014
Traffic was a nightmare
comin' over the Hill.

1091
01:15:26,215 --> 01:15:32,114
That's fine. We've only got 70 pages
to shoot today. Take your time ?

1092
01:15:32,215 --> 01:15:34,114
David!

1093
01:15:34,616 --> 01:15:37,516
We'll get you into hair and make-up
after this. Just put this on.

1094
01:15:37,615 --> 01:15:39,715
What are you doing?

1095
01:15:40,215 --> 01:15:42,116
Um...

1096
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:46,015
Hi! Welcome! I hear you are really good.

1097
01:15:46,115 --> 01:15:49,114
- Good luck.
- What are you doing here?

1098
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:50,815
David!

1099
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:53,615
- Your lines are on cue cards over here...
- What is she doing here?

1100
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,914
- Oh. But feel free to ad-lib, OK?
- Ad-lib? I...

1101
01:15:56,914 --> 01:15:59,315
In fact, I want you to ad-lib.
I mean, I know I hate these...

1102
01:15:59,315 --> 01:16:02,715
...but that's the magic that I'm after,
y'know, just to let it go, have fun with it.

1103
01:16:02,715 --> 01:16:05,016
We're gonna give a whole new feel
to the show. Eric !

1104
01:16:05,115 --> 01:16:06,515
So just do one of those...

1105
01:16:06,616 --> 01:16:10,315
...just let it out and just
have fun with it. You remember Betty?

1106
01:16:10,715 --> 01:16:12,715
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1107
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:15,315
Settle, please! Stand by, rehearsal.

1108
01:16:16,814 --> 01:16:17,615
Betty ?

1109
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,815
Just do what you've been doing, OK ?

1110
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:23,015
Watch the scene, take your cue from here.

1111
01:16:23,315 --> 01:16:25,815
Hank! Lines are over here.

1112
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:28,315
Here we go. In!

1113
01:16:28,315 --> 01:16:30,315
Five.

1114
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:33,115
Four. Three. Two.

1115
01:16:33,415 --> 01:16:35,515
Is this some kind of a game?

1116
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:37,916
No, it's more like a nightmare
I can't wake up from.

1117
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,515
There are other people in this nightmare,
and they're going to get hurt.

1118
01:16:42,415 --> 01:16:45,315
- Uh, I feel so... Arm! Please.
- Oh.

1119
01:16:45,415 --> 01:16:47,714
I feel so alone right now.

1120
01:16:48,015 --> 01:16:50,214
Here we go. Showtime, showtime.

1121
01:17:05,815 --> 01:17:08,416
- Are you all right?
- I think you stepped on my first line.

1122
01:17:08,515 --> 01:17:10,715
I was talking to her.
Do you need anything?

1123
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:22,515
Listen, I'm sorry, I thought this would be
the best way. Throw you into it, y'know ?

1124
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:23,716
What the hell's going on?

1125
01:17:23,815 --> 01:17:26,516
If you need a minute to get
your instrument straight...

1126
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:31,915
Can I talk to you?
Can I talk to you? Just a second.

1127
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:39,215
- David...
- Stop calling me David.

1128
01:17:39,215 --> 01:17:41,615
For Christ's sake, we're on the set.
You don't have to call me David here, OK?

1129
01:17:41,714 --> 01:17:45,215
- What's going on?
- What is going on, what?

1130
01:17:45,716 --> 01:17:49,816
You're acting crazy here!
Isn't this exactly what you wanted?

1131
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,816
- I don't know.
- Is there a problem, George?

1132
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:55,315
No, no, no! No problem. There's...

1133
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:59,315
What is the problem?
Just... do that thing that you do.

1134
01:17:59,415 --> 01:18:03,015
I mean, come on! You drove me nuts
with this for three days.

1135
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:05,415
Now just relax and... and let's do it.

1136
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:08,315
Here we go! Here we go.
You're fine. You'll be fine. Here we go!

1137
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:10,516
Sorry about that. All right? Here we go.

1138
01:18:10,615 --> 01:18:14,015
And... five. Four. Three.

1139
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:16,616
Is this some kind of game
that you're playing?

1140
01:18:16,616 --> 01:18:18,615
No, it's more like a nightmare
I can't wake up from.

1141
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:24,116
There are other people in that nightmare,
and they're going to get hurt.

1142
01:18:24,315 --> 01:18:27,515
- Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1143
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:30,915
- Betty?
- Oh, no.

1144
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,515
- Who's driving the car, David?

1145
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,215
- How can I ask you this?

1146
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:38,216
This is bullshit!

1147
01:18:38,216 --> 01:18:40,215
I cannot work like this!

1148
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:43,016
- All right, everybody, take five.
- No, no, no. Hold on.

1149
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:45,215
- Let me talk to her. She's just...
- It was a gamble, it didn't work.

1150
01:18:45,215 --> 01:18:47,315
We have to move on.

1151
01:18:47,315 --> 01:18:50,115
- Goddamnit, she's been doing it all week!
- No! George, I said forget it!

1152
01:18:50,215 --> 01:18:54,216
OK. All right. Well...
What are you looking at, Eric?

1153
01:18:54,216 --> 01:18:59,115
I hope you're happy. I just put my ass
on the line for you, and my reputation...

1154
01:18:59,216 --> 01:19:01,615
...and you just made a total idiot out of me.
Are you happy?

1155
01:19:01,615 --> 01:19:02,716
I'm sorry, what did I do?

1156
01:19:02,815 --> 01:19:05,316
Who put you up to this?
Did my ex-wife do this?

1157
01:19:05,316 --> 01:19:08,917
- You know, David...
- Stop calling me that! My name is George!

1158
01:19:09,018 --> 01:19:12,417
George! Say it!
This is a TV show! A television show...

1159
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:14,818
...and if you don't know the difference,
you're more fucked up than I thought!

1160
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:16,417
Leave her alone, George!

1161
01:19:16,517 --> 01:19:19,118
Shut the fuck up! You're a grip.
Go... grip something!

1162
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:21,518
And you are not an actress, are you?

1163
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:24,617
What are you?
You're like a soap-opera... groupie, right?

1164
01:19:24,617 --> 01:19:28,117
I mean, is that it, right?
You've nothing better to do but this!

1165
01:19:28,117 --> 01:19:31,119
Well, why don't you get a fucking life
and stop ruining mine!

1166
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:33,117
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- She gave me this one shot...

1167
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:36,218
...one shot in my life to do this,
and you have destroyed it!

1168
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:38,817
Thank you very much!
Thanks, Betty, that was great !

1169
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:50,917
Are you hearing this? Hey!

1170
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,317
She's fuckin' crazy!
Don't look at me like that!

1171
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:56,418
You! tell them who I... Hey!

1172
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:59,018
Hey! Tell 'em who I am. Tell 'em.

1173
01:19:59,619 --> 01:20:01,618
George McCord?

1174
01:20:01,618 --> 01:20:05,519
No, no. No, no, no. No, not now.
I am David. I am Dr David Ravell!

1175
01:20:05,519 --> 01:20:07,318
I'm the great Dr David Ravell, right?

1176
01:20:07,618 --> 01:20:11,517
Loma Vista's greatest... I'm the doctor!
I don't think that! She thinks that!

1177
01:20:11,618 --> 01:20:14,717
- What... Who did you call me?
- She called you George... George.

1178
01:20:14,818 --> 01:20:17,718
George McCord, my favourite actor?

1179
01:20:18,117 --> 01:20:21,317
- Oh... oh... oh, God.
- What are you doing here?

1180
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:24,218
- Why am I here?
- Oh... you're sick.

1181
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:26,318
- I, um...
- What do you do now?

1182
01:20:26,418 --> 01:20:29,218
What... Are you going to kill me?
No! Don't get near me!

1183
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:31,417
Don't touch anything! Crazy person!

1184
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:33,318
What do you do now? What?

1185
01:20:37,218 --> 01:20:39,217
Um...

1186
01:20:41,317 --> 01:20:43,717
I'm gonna go.

1187
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:48,718
OK, moving on! Further on?

1188
01:21:10,017 --> 01:21:14,718
How do you do, Mr McCord? We're trying
to locate a deranged fan of yours.

1189
01:21:14,718 --> 01:21:16,919
- A Mrs Betty...
- Deranged. Yeah, that'd be the, uh...

1190
01:21:17,018 --> 01:21:20,519
...that'd be the right word for it.
That's not necessary.

1191
01:21:20,618 --> 01:21:27,319
Uh, she's staying with a friend of hers,
Rosa Herreras... or Hernandez.

1192
01:21:27,418 --> 01:21:30,418
Has a... has a H sound to it.
They're in Silver Lake.

1193
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,819
That's all I know.

1194
01:21:31,918 --> 01:21:33,517
- Silver Lake.
- Yeah.

1195
01:21:35,418 --> 01:21:38,718
- You must get this a lot.
- Mm-hm.

1196
01:21:39,217 --> 01:21:41,419
More than you know.

1197
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:44,418
Anything else?

1198
01:21:44,418 --> 01:21:45,818
- No.
- OK, great.

1199
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,618
Uh, actually, there is.

1200
01:21:49,018 --> 01:21:53,018
You know, I'm a big fan of the show,
and I figure you being Dr Ravell and all...

1201
01:21:53,018 --> 01:21:56,719
...I thought you might be able to go out
there and tell Jasmine to come outside.

1202
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,418
- Well, you thought wrong.
- Hey, man, it's just an autograph.

1203
01:21:59,418 --> 01:22:01,418
- It's not for me.
- No, it never is.

1204
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:04,218
Motherfucker! You need to have
some fuckin' manners, man!

1205
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:06,218
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

1206
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:11,319
Hey! I saw your TV movie! It sucked!
Hasselhoff blew you off the screen!

1207
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:20,518
Betty?

1208
01:22:21,418 --> 01:22:23,719
Hey, did the pizza guy show up yet?

1209
01:22:29,419 --> 01:22:31,218
Can I have these chips?

1210
01:22:31,218 --> 01:22:33,019
Sure.

1211
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:35,318
Thanks.

1212
01:22:35,919 --> 01:22:38,019
Are you all right?

1213
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,119
Did something happen?

1214
01:22:58,118 --> 01:23:00,619
Oh, shit! Motherfuck!

1215
01:23:04,519 --> 01:23:07,118
Call a doctor, bitch!

1216
01:23:17,418 --> 01:23:19,518
- What the hell is that?
- Don't ask.

1217
01:23:20,018 --> 01:23:23,318
It's all there. Hasn't been touched.

1218
01:23:24,217 --> 01:23:26,919
You were right about Del.
He wasn't lying.

1219
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:32,919
Yeah, well... you were right
about what the lady bartender said.

1220
01:23:33,019 --> 01:23:36,918
Yeah, but you were right first.
You gotta follow your instincts.

1221
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:40,819
So what are your instincts
telling you now, kid?

1222
01:23:40,918 --> 01:23:43,518
Take this shit back to Detroit
and get our fuckin' money.

1223
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:48,418
Ah, we could do that.
I could be on my way to Florida...

1224
01:23:48,418 --> 01:23:51,819
...you could go on down to Thailand
or someplace and fuck your brains out.

1225
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:54,719
- But that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
- No.

1226
01:23:56,019 --> 01:23:57,919
She's my last one.

1227
01:23:58,119 --> 01:24:01,918
And my instincts are telling me
I've got to see this through with her.

1228
01:24:01,918 --> 01:24:03,919
And If there's anything
I've tried to teach you here...

1229
01:24:04,018 --> 01:24:06,218
It's to follow my instincts.

1230
01:24:06,218 --> 01:24:08,318
No. It's to follow my instincts.

1231
01:24:08,318 --> 01:24:12,620
So we go up there and
we conclude our business. Case closed.

1232
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:14,921
I have to leave.

1233
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,720
- Leave?
- Mm-hm.

1234
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,921
- Where you going?
- Kansas.

1235
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,522
- Tonight?
- Uh-huh.

1236
01:24:21,522 --> 01:24:24,521
C'mon, you're going to drive
halfway across the country this minute?

1237
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:27,921
Uh-huh. I have to go fix
what happened to my husband.

1238
01:24:28,121 --> 01:24:30,721
So, uh, now you have a husband?

1239
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:34,620
Had. He was killed in the dining room.

1240
01:24:35,621 --> 01:24:39,220
- Huh?
- Y'know, I think I saw the whole thing.

1241
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:41,820
I remember blood everywhere
and everything.

1242
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,821
What are you saying, Betty, huh?

1243
01:24:43,821 --> 01:24:46,721
Huh?

1244
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:48,721
I really don't know.

1245
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:51,521
- Yeah, just a minute!

1246
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,421
This is crazy, Betty, OK? Just don't go.

1247
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,721
Just stay here, and I'll be right back.

1248
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,320
- How much?
- Uh, Detective Jefferson.

1249
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,721
Oh. Did Betty call you?

1250
01:25:17,022 --> 01:25:20,321
She's got problems, but... she's no killer.

1251
01:25:22,021 --> 01:25:24,821
You guys can just straighten this out.

1252
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,221
Go easy on her, OK?
Cos she's had a really rough day.

1253
01:25:29,221 --> 01:25:32,521
- Hey, Rosa?
- These guys are here to help you, Betty.

1254
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,722
I don't think so.

1255
01:25:36,222 --> 01:25:38,422
C'mon! C'mere! C'mere! C'mon!
Get the fuck over there!

1256
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:40,921
C'mere! C'mon! Sit down! Shut up!

1257
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,721
So.

1258
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:46,821
We meet again.

1259
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:57,921
I've spent many long hours in the car
with your face staring back at me.

1260
01:25:58,621 --> 01:26:01,321
I've seen it painted on the horizon.

1261
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:03,021
- What's wrong with you?
- Huh?

1262
01:26:03,122 --> 01:26:05,821
- That's our pizza.

1263
01:26:06,121 --> 01:26:08,522
- Wesley.
- C'mere. C'mere!

1264
01:26:08,821 --> 01:26:12,921
- Get rid of 'em, you understand?
- OK.

1265
01:26:20,121 --> 01:26:23,620
- Hi.
- Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you.

1266
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:28,422
- Roy, what are you doing here?
- You... You are in serious danger.

1267
01:26:28,522 --> 01:26:31,821
Oh? Well, Roy,
it's really not a good time right now.

1268
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:34,722
Betty, I would have been here sooner,
but Elden put me in jail.

1269
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:37,222
- Oh.
- He still thinks that you had Del scalped.

1270
01:26:37,321 --> 01:26:41,020
- Hey! I never said that, OK?
- Hi, Sheriff.

1271
01:26:41,122 --> 01:26:43,921
- I don't think...
- Come on, Betty. Look. Open up.

1272
01:26:43,921 --> 01:26:48,021
- I gotta ask you some questions...
- Look, I really think it's important...

1273
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,821
...to find out if you looked inside the...
- This is really, really not a great time.

1274
01:26:50,821 --> 01:26:52,320
Hey!

1275
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:55,422
Hey! Don't give me that!

1276
01:26:55,522 --> 01:26:57,921
I've come 2,000 miles for this!

1277
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:00,022
Ah!

1278
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:02,921
You probably flew!

1279
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:05,221
Come on!

1280
01:27:07,321 --> 01:27:10,021
I crossed the River Styx to find her, pal!

1281
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:13,021
I travelled the fucking country to get here!

1282
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:18,721
- Who are these idiots?
- Um, that's Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter.

1283
01:27:18,821 --> 01:27:21,122
And that's Sheriff Ballard. He, um...

1284
01:27:21,422 --> 01:27:24,122
Well, we went to Fair Oaks High.

1285
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:26,522
Oh, great. This is... This is great.

1286
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:28,922
Fuck! Get your ass down! C'mon.

1287
01:27:29,022 --> 01:27:32,121
Whassup? Whassup? Whassup?
C'mere. C'mere. C'mere, motherfucker!

1288
01:27:32,222 --> 01:27:35,722
Fuck, man! C'mere. C'mere. C'mere.
Sit there!

1289
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:38,021
- I got two kids and a dog.
- Yeah, who don't?

1290
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:43,521
What? What? What? You gonna
shoot me? Have some more.

1291
01:27:48,021 --> 01:27:49,022
What you doing?

1292
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:52,122
Act professional!

1293
01:27:52,122 --> 01:27:53,721
That's not professional!

1294
01:27:54,421 --> 01:27:57,221
Don't worry about me,
find out what they know.

1295
01:27:57,221 --> 01:27:58,121
Shit.

1296
01:28:01,122 --> 01:28:04,121
Oh. Oh, OK.

1297
01:28:04,121 --> 01:28:07,121
OK... OK... OK...

1298
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:09,221
OK... Um...

1299
01:28:09,221 --> 01:28:11,022
Um, um... OK, um...

1300
01:28:23,022 --> 01:28:26,022
I suppose you want me, to, um...

1301
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:29,221
What?

1302
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:32,721
To take off my, um...

1303
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:34,921
Oh, no! No.

1304
01:28:35,021 --> 01:28:36,521
No?

1305
01:28:37,221 --> 01:28:40,921
- Do you know who I am?
- Oh, I've got a pretty good idea.

1306
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:47,222
Listen, you didn't have anything to do
with what Del was into, did you, Betty?

1307
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:50,022
I've no idea what Del was mixed up in.

1308
01:28:51,222 --> 01:28:54,722
So you had nothing to do with the drugs?

1309
01:28:54,722 --> 01:28:57,121
Oh, my God! Drugs?

1310
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:58,922
God, no!

1311
01:28:59,721 --> 01:29:01,921
I am totally against drugs.

1312
01:29:07,522 --> 01:29:11,422
Life is very strange.
I really had you pegged...

1313
01:29:11,422 --> 01:29:13,822
...as a cold-blooded bitch.

1314
01:29:14,222 --> 01:29:16,523
I mean, not that I didn't
still admire you for it.

1315
01:29:25,224 --> 01:29:27,723
If you didn't come here to kill me,
then...

1316
01:29:28,223 --> 01:29:30,624
...why are you here?

1317
01:29:34,924 --> 01:29:36,224
To see you.

1318
01:29:38,724 --> 01:29:42,624
- How'd you two dumb fucks find Betty?
- I just put it all together.

1319
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:45,024
I knew that David, Lonnie and Chloe
were from that show.

1320
01:29:46,723 --> 01:29:51,124
Betty thinks they're real people.
Sounded strange, but it was worth a shot.

1321
01:29:52,424 --> 01:29:54,424
- What do you want?
- Ignore him.

1322
01:29:54,424 --> 01:29:56,523
And don't take that tape off.
You're gonna regret it.

1323
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,224
You are such a liar, Elden Ballard!

1324
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:02,124
- Oh, shut up!
- I'm the one that figured it out, not him!

1325
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:03,724
- Shut up, man!
- You are really smart ?

1326
01:30:03,825 --> 01:30:05,524
- Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
- Look, shut up!

1327
01:30:05,524 --> 01:30:07,223
- I'm the one that watched the...
- Shut the fuck up!

1328
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:09,323
Shut the fuck up, both of you,
before I kill both of you!

1329
01:30:10,124 --> 01:30:12,623
- You watched the show?
- Yeah! I'm the one that watched the show!

1330
01:30:12,724 --> 01:30:15,624
- He's the one that didn't, cos he's a liar!
- Calm down!

1331
01:30:16,324 --> 01:30:19,424
Stop acting like a little bitch.
Now, did Chloe crack?

1332
01:30:19,424 --> 01:30:21,423
Chloe fell completely apart!

1333
01:30:21,523 --> 01:30:24,624
- You didn't know Chloe cracked, did you?
- Agh!

1334
01:30:24,624 --> 01:30:27,824
- What about Jasmine?
- Jasmine's a lesbian.

1335
01:30:28,025 --> 01:30:31,324
Lying motherfucker!
You lie! Jasmine is not a lesbian!

1336
01:30:31,324 --> 01:30:32,724
I know what I'm talking about!

1337
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,824
- Mm! Mm!
- What you want?

1338
01:30:34,824 --> 01:30:35,924
You scream, you die.

1339
01:30:36,024 --> 01:30:39,024
I'm gonna take this shit off.
You scream, you fucking die!

1340
01:30:39,623 --> 01:30:42,023
I have a tape of today's show.

1341
01:30:43,924 --> 01:30:46,023
Jasmine You got a lot of men in motion
over what you did.

1342
01:30:46,124 --> 01:30:48,624
- What I did?
- Don't give me that, Chloe!

1343
01:30:48,724 --> 01:30:51,924
- What about what he did?
- I wasn't born yesterday.

1344
01:30:52,024 --> 01:30:54,625
You get in a man's car, there's a reason.
We both know that.

1345
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:58,825
- Do you think that maybe...?
- Oh, no, they're fine.

1346
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:05,324
I don't meet people like you.

1347
01:31:06,024 --> 01:31:08,323
I'm a garbage man
of the human condition.

1348
01:31:08,424 --> 01:31:11,724
I deal with trash. People who would
trade in part of themselves...

1349
01:31:11,824 --> 01:31:14,223
...for a few more minutes
of their rotten lives.

1350
01:31:14,324 --> 01:31:15,624
But you're different.

1351
01:31:15,624 --> 01:31:17,425
I am?

1352
01:31:17,624 --> 01:31:21,024
Yeah. You could probably have
anything you want.

1353
01:31:21,124 --> 01:31:25,524
Someone as beautiful and stylish
as you are. And you don't even realise it.

1354
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:30,024
I just don't think I'm who you think I am.

1355
01:31:30,024 --> 01:31:32,424
Let me just... Let me just get this out.

1356
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:39,823
I like walks in the rain,
and sunsets, and symphonies...

1357
01:31:40,025 --> 01:31:42,125
...kids, animals.

1358
01:31:42,424 --> 01:31:45,224
I read passionately.
I like to discuss things.

1359
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:49,124
I... I guess, basically, I'm conservative...

1360
01:31:49,223 --> 01:31:51,425
...but flexible.

1361
01:31:54,024 --> 01:31:56,824
I've followed you
all the way across the country...

1362
01:31:56,924 --> 01:32:00,024
...y'know, and I've come to feel that...

1363
01:32:01,425 --> 01:32:04,324
...we are a lot more alike than you think.

1364
01:32:05,024 --> 01:32:10,624
But I thought you said that you were
the garbage man of humanity.

1365
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:13,025
I just...

1366
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:16,425
...hoped I could leave that behind me.

1367
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:21,824
I thought no meant no.

1368
01:32:22,325 --> 01:32:25,825
- Scoffs
- What?

1369
01:32:27,024 --> 01:32:29,124
Say something.

1370
01:32:29,124 --> 01:32:30,824
First of all...

1371
01:32:31,324 --> 01:32:35,925
...don't insult my intelligence by telling me
that David Ravell attacked you in that car.

1372
01:32:36,225 --> 01:32:38,325
So, um, that Jasmine...

1373
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:40,524
...she certainly is intriguing, isn't she?

1374
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:43,824
Jasmine ain't no dyke.
She's just tryin' to find herself.

1375
01:32:45,224 --> 01:32:48,625
- You're my only friend.
- Look at the titties on Jasmine.

1376
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:50,025
You're my only friend.

1377
01:32:51,824 --> 01:32:55,324
Goddamn! Ah, sooky-sooky, now!
Rub her titties. Rub her titties!

1378
01:32:55,324 --> 01:32:58,224
You can do that shit on TV? Oh, shit!
Look at that shit!

1379
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:01,625
Put Jasmine in and I walk out!

1380
01:33:01,825 --> 01:33:03,825
You would never cook up
a scheme like this, would you?

1381
01:33:05,225 --> 01:33:07,425
What the...! Oh, shit!

1382
01:33:08,825 --> 01:33:09,724
C'mere!

1383
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:18,025
Wesley! Get over there.

1384
01:33:20,824 --> 01:33:22,324
Daddy!

1385
01:33:23,425 --> 01:33:25,423
What the... Wesley?

1386
01:33:36,225 --> 01:33:38,525
Oh, my God! My fish are out there!

1387
01:33:38,525 --> 01:33:41,425
- I know. They're inashiki koi.
- How'd you know that?

1388
01:33:41,425 --> 01:33:45,025
Hey! We're in a shoot-out here!
You wanna shut up about the damn fish?

1389
01:33:45,025 --> 01:33:46,824
No, Elden, you shut up!

1390
01:33:48,124 --> 01:33:50,725
I'll get your fish.

1391
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:52,525
Roy!

1392
01:33:52,925 --> 01:33:55,325
- Oh, Christ.
- What?

1393
01:33:59,825 --> 01:34:02,026
They shot my boy.

1394
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,225
My son is dead.

1395
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:11,224
Sorry.

1396
01:34:14,225 --> 01:34:16,524
You're the reason I'm here.

1397
01:34:17,124 --> 01:34:19,327
That's right, I'm here because of you.

1398
01:34:19,428 --> 01:34:20,927
Oh.

1399
01:34:44,427 --> 01:34:46,726
Shit.

1400
01:34:51,427 --> 01:34:53,227
I need my other gun.
Check his jacket. I'll cover you.

1401
01:34:53,327 --> 01:34:56,227
- No, let's wait for the real police.
- I am the real police!

1402
01:34:56,227 --> 01:34:57,927
So why can't we just sneak outside, huh?

1403
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:02,427
Lady, you don't just run away
from crime. And Betty's in there!

1404
01:35:07,226 --> 01:35:10,527
So all of this really is
because of a soap opera?

1405
01:35:11,328 --> 01:35:14,027
My son is dead because...

1406
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:18,327
...you wanted to be with this doctor.

1407
01:35:19,128 --> 01:35:21,327
This fake doctor.

1408
01:35:27,827 --> 01:35:30,428
Well, too late, anyway.

1409
01:35:30,627 --> 01:35:33,227
You could at least give me my gun.

1410
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:36,127
Maybe I could shoot my way out.
Take a couple of 'em with me.

1411
01:35:36,928 --> 01:35:39,128
I think I'd rather not.

1412
01:35:39,227 --> 01:35:41,527
Betty, please. Please.

1413
01:35:41,627 --> 01:35:46,026
I don't want to shrivel up alone
in some stinking prison. No way.

1414
01:35:46,026 --> 01:35:48,327
I've got my professional pride.

1415
01:35:49,027 --> 01:35:50,527
And...

1416
01:35:52,528 --> 01:35:56,626
...I don't want somebody else
to get credit for taking me out.

1417
01:36:00,627 --> 01:36:03,027
I want you to listen to me.

1418
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:08,928
Betty...

1419
01:36:11,827 --> 01:36:14,426
...you never needed that actor.

1420
01:36:14,426 --> 01:36:16,827
You don't need that doctor.

1421
01:36:16,927 --> 01:36:19,027
You don't need any man.

1422
01:36:19,327 --> 01:36:21,927
It's not the Forties, you know?

1423
01:36:22,427 --> 01:36:25,026
Honey, you don't need anybody.

1424
01:36:25,627 --> 01:36:27,627
You know why?

1425
01:36:27,727 --> 01:36:29,628
Hm.

1426
01:36:34,927 --> 01:36:37,227
Because you've got yourself.

1427
01:37:29,728 --> 01:37:32,628
In a story that police say is bizarre
even for Hollywood...

1428
01:37:32,628 --> 01:37:36,628
...a father-son team of killers
tracked a Kansas soap-opera fan...

1429
01:37:36,727 --> 01:37:39,227
...halfway across the country...

1430
01:37:39,227 --> 01:37:42,927
...only to find themselves the victims
in a final, bloody confrontation.

1431
01:37:42,927 --> 01:37:45,627
- We go now to BB Burke at the scene...
- That's our Betty.

1432
01:37:45,627 --> 01:37:48,928
This story is beyond belief!
Which is perfect for us.

1433
01:37:49,028 --> 01:37:51,428
It's free advertising,
it's gonna run for months.

1434
01:37:51,527 --> 01:37:53,627
I don't think she can do it.

1435
01:37:53,728 --> 01:37:57,528
I really don't. Are you serious?
Did you see what happened?

1436
01:37:57,528 --> 01:38:00,027
Well, who wouldn't freeze
under those circumstances?

1437
01:38:00,027 --> 01:38:01,728
And I don't care what her problems are.

1438
01:38:01,828 --> 01:38:04,628
She wouldn't be the first person
in the cast with problems.

1439
01:38:04,727 --> 01:38:07,627
That's why we have nothing to lose
by sending you to talk to her.

1440
01:38:07,627 --> 01:38:10,627
Me? OK. Let's talk about me.

1441
01:38:10,627 --> 01:38:13,027
What about my feelings about all this?

1442
01:38:13,027 --> 01:38:15,128
I don't really care about your feelings.

1443
01:38:15,128 --> 01:38:18,029
I did like your icy-water idea
the other day, though.

1444
01:38:18,128 --> 01:38:19,828
Yeah?

1445
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:26,529
I'm toying with the idea of killing
David Ravell off in a boating accident.

1446
01:38:26,529 --> 01:38:29,028
One of those castaway deals
with Chloe and...

1447
01:38:29,728 --> 01:38:32,127
No? How do I come back?

1448
01:38:33,828 --> 01:38:35,726
No, no, no. No. Don't...

1449
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:39,528
Don't try the blackmail bullshit with me,
Lyla, cos it's kinda... it's beneath you.

1450
01:38:39,528 --> 01:38:42,229
So don't even think about it.
It's an emphatic no, missy.

1451
01:38:42,428 --> 01:38:44,528
Poom! End of story, right there.

1452
01:38:46,628 --> 01:38:48,828
I'm sorry for what I did.

1453
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:52,427
I'm sorry for the things that I... said...

1454
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:56,128
...and for not respecting you...

1455
01:38:56,927 --> 01:39:01,028
...and just all the stupid little things
that I was...

1456
01:39:01,028 --> 01:39:04,328
- When you have a minute.
- I really don't like the idea of autographs...

1457
01:39:04,427 --> 01:39:06,528
...and I'm kinda
in a moment right here, so...

1458
01:39:07,128 --> 01:39:11,828
- It's the check.
- Sorry about that.

1459
01:39:13,028 --> 01:39:15,128
Uh...No, I got this.

1460
01:39:15,128 --> 01:39:19,027
My treat. It's not the Forties, y'know.

1461
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:22,430
OK.

1462
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:25,730
Do you know that
my best friend once said...

1463
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:28,629
...that if you were any handsomer,
it would be a crime.

1464
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,329
Thank you.

1465
01:39:30,629 --> 01:39:33,330
It's just too bad
that you're such an asshole.

1466
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:39,229
That's OK. You know what? That's OK.

1467
01:39:39,331 --> 01:39:42,930
That's all right. I'm... I'm OK with that.
That's fair enough.

1468
01:39:43,631 --> 01:39:48,429
Now we've, uh, settled
the whole asshole thing, uh...

1469
01:39:48,429 --> 01:39:53,230
...is there any chance that you would
think about joining the show?

1470
01:39:58,730 --> 01:39:59,930
At all?

1471
01:40:02,431 --> 01:40:03,831
There's always a chance, David.

1472
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,030
But what about tomorrow,
and the next day...

1473
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:08,430
...and the next day, and the next?

1474
01:40:08,531 --> 01:40:11,830
If you were any handsomer, Doctor...

1475
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:13,630
...it'd be a crime.

1476
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,929
I take it that means you're free tomorrow?

1477
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:19,729
I was going to ask you that, too!

1478
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:22,630
It's as if I've been in
some sort of dream state.

1479
01:40:22,729 --> 01:40:27,630
Like... Like you didn't know who you were,
or what you were doing?

1480
01:40:28,031 --> 01:40:30,631
- Yes.
- Daniel, ven! Aquí está la novela!

1481
01:40:30,631 --> 01:40:32,730
I have that effect on people.

1482
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:35,630
Well, you certainly had that effect on me.

1483
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,729
siempre hay una possibilità, David.

1484
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:42,130
Ma tu ci sarai domani,
e domani, e domani ancora?

1485
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:44,230
Dottore...

1486
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,630
...più bello di così, si muore.

1487
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:50,831
Credo di capire che sei libera stasera?

1488
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:53,730
- Io, ti amo, David.
- Ti amo, Geri.

1489
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:55,130
Gasps

1490
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,830
Excuse me, sir?

1491
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,130
Sir?
