1
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,651
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

2
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,697
So where's the family?

3
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:17,734
Hammer's on the wave runner.

4
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:20,168
Mommy and Daddy
are on the beach.

5
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:22,501
Way down on the beach.
You're safe.

6
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:40,320
- Hello?
- I'm saying good-bye, man.

7
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,417
Gene.
What's the matter?

8
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,485
- The Fall of Rome.
- Where?

9
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:49,659
Where else?
Allied Cayman Bank.

10
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,100
I just got the word.
They're coming in 15 minutes.

11
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,103
You're joking.
You're just telling me this now?

12
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:57,504
- You're supposed to keep me informed.
- Your clients will understand.

13
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,442
- Fuck the clients. I'm talking about me.
- What?

14
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:02,741
Gene, you've gotta go in
and transfer my account.

15
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:06,010
- I didn't know you had one.
- You think I'd live in a fucking tax haven...

16
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,450
making other cunts rich
and not put something aside for myself?

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,954
You're not supposed
to have an offshore account.

18
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:15,617
- How much are you in for?
- Everything. Just over a million.

19
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:18,287
Jesus. I'm sorry, brother.

20
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:22,594
There are 500 banks on this
fucking island, Gene. We'll be all right.

21
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,964
Okay? Gene...

22
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,390
I'm looking for the prospectus
for the condo property.

23
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,266
Uh, I must have left it
back in the office, sir.

24
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,930
Yeah, I bring you to Miami
for two fucking hours.

25
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:06,067
You bring a roller case full of fuck-knows-
what and forget the most important piece...

26
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,077
- Allen!
- Carl.

27
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:10,113
- Welcome to Florida.
- How's it going?

28
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,672
Oh, hi. You guys have
a good trip in?

29
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,777
Allen, I've been thinking it over,
and I really think this is the end of it.

30
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,788
I'm out.

31
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,222
It's just with my daughter's
18th birthday...

32
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,193
I'm thinking it's time
to take the higher road.

33
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:29,096
Um, we can deal differently. You know,
we can go into hedge funds, bonds...

34
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,430
No, no, no, no.
That's not my style.

35
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,063
Besides, what's all this
I've been reading...

36
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,007
you know, about the banks down there
closing left and right?

37
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:42,307
Th-They're just clearing out the riffraff...
you know, the fucking cunts...

38
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:45,815
and leaving the way clear
for legitimate businessmen...

39
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:47,817
uh, like yourself.

40
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:50,683
So what are you gonna do
with all the money under the mattress?

41
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:54,713
What about the condo? I invest 1.5.
I don't even get a brochure?

42
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:58,660
Don't worry. I'll get my idiot secretary to
fax you one as soon as we get to the island.

43
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,857
- You should lighten up on her.
- Fuck her. Excuse me.

44
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,797
So, Pip, you're 18.
You gonna get laid sometime soon?

45
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,501
Hey, as soon as I find a decent man.

46
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,839
Good luck with that.
The boys at our school?

47
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:16,505
- Are you serious?
- Good evening, ladies.

48
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,775
- Hi, Mr. Ridley.
- Hey, Dad, you made it.

49
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:20,783
Of course.

50
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:24,116
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:27,214
Okay.

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,419
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

53
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,655
We'll celebrate this weekend, okay?

54
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,496
- Why are you leaving so soon?
- You don't want me spoiling your party.

55
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,297
Eighteen years old! Oh, my God!

56
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,803
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

57
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,429
- Love you guys.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:44,440
Nice. Let me see.

59
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,348
Good morning, Miami!

60
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,161
Sheila, it's Carl.

61
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:13,203
No, no, no. Me first.
I feel like an ass.

62
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,967
I... That scene yesterday,
that whole charade.

63
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,507
I should've called you,
and I'm sorry.

64
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:27,847
I just don't want you to think
it didn't mean anything.

65
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,410
Sheila? Hello? Sheila?

66
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:33,422
Bye, Dad. Love you.

67
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,458
Hey, Consuela. I'm leaving.

68
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:37,619
- Would you like something to eat?
- Oh, sure.

69
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:41,324
- Can you wrap it up for me?
- How was your birthday?

70
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:44,333
Oh, it was so much fun.
I wish you could've been there.

71
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,995
- Okay, I gotta go. Bye.
- Okay. Have a nice day.

72
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,438
- Dad, you got a fax!
- Drive safely, honey.

73
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:49,461
Is Mr. Ridley available?

74
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,334
It's okay.

75
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:58,307
Carl Ridley. Special Agent Martinez,
Department ofTreasury.

76
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,538
- Am I under arrest?
- No, no, no. No.

77
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:03,910
We're just here
to serve you this subpoena.

78
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,747
We need to seize anything
that might be relevant business-wise.

79
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:10,912
Consuela, get these men
what they need.

80
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:14,321
- Okay, mister.
- Excuse me. I'm late for an appointment.

81
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:18,088
Good luck with that
appointment, Carl.

82
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,490
Let's get to work.
Take it all.

83
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,693
You two, upstairs.

84
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,246
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

85
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:51,852
Okay, jumping jacks.
And one, two, three, four...

86
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,797
five, six and seven and down.

87
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,266
- And one, two...
- What are you doing?

88
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,360
- Pippa, sweetheart, I need to talk to you.
- No, stop.

89
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,735
- I'm her father.
- You can't take a student out of class.

90
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:04,296
- Don't.
- Please.

91
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,604
Sirl
Sirl

92
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,794
Folks, this is
your captain speaking.

93
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:28,229
We'd like to welcome you
to Owen Roberts International Airport...

94
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,892
in George Town
on Grand Cayman Island.

95
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,338
Is there some other way
you can get around this?

96
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,777
Oh, be cool, cat.
It's 4:15 on a Friday.

97
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,974
Don't know where
you're rushing to, man.

98
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:25,045
It's a shrine to all the fishermen passed on.

99
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:28,216
It's all closed, man.
They won't be openin'till Monday.

100
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,988
- What about Cayman Merchant?
- They've been closed for the last 4 months.

101
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:33,029
- Pippal
- That's my father there.

102
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:35,530
Pippal

103
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,727
Come on, honey.
We gotta go.

104
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,335
We weren't expecting you
for several weeks, Mr. Ridley.

105
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,669
Yeah, I know.

106
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:47,676
I must say
you have a lovely daughter.

107
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:51,077
She's not exactly digging my chili
at the moment, if you know what I mean.

108
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,742
Oh, goodness, yes.
I have one of my own.

109
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,843
Yeah.

110
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,584
- Something wrong?
- I only seem to have the spare key.

111
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:04,889
Oh, that's fine. We'll come down
if we need anything.

112
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:08,329
- Okay. Thank you, Mr. Ridley.
- See you later.

113
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,591
Thank you.

114
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,930
Come on, Pip.
It's C-4.

115
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,939
What, you're not
speaking to me now?

116
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,134
You had this planned
the whole time.

117
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,803
It was supposed to be a place
for us to spend Christmas.

118
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,404
- A surprise.
- Yeah, well, I'm fucking surprised.

119
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,949
Hey, you know what?
Look at me!

120
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:29,542
Hey, we're gonna start over.
It's gonna be okay.

121
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,351
How? Everything we had
was back there.

122
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,891
Well, I'll hire someone
to pack up the house.

123
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,189
We'll get you a new car.
How does that sound?

124
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,561
It's not about the stupid car, Dad.
It's my friends, memories.

125
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,965
Mom was buried in Miami.
You can't just pack that stuff up into a box.

126
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,969
Honey, they were
gonna take everything.

127
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,971
They already have.

128
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:04,049
- Huh?
- Oh!

129
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:08,785
Sorry. Um, pardon. Oh.

130
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,832
It's 949-9211. Call me.
I'm sweatin' you out here.

131
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:32,246
Dad, can you have somebody
come change the sheets in my room?

132
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,716
- What's wrong?
- I don't like the color.

133
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:37,948
- Well, sure, sweetheart.
- I'm going to the beach.

134
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:40,285
Have fun.

135
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:49,423
She doesn't like the color.
That's my princess.

136
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,699
Darren. Two more. Blue.

137
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:57,467
Good stuff.

138
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,702
Yo, bloods,
I not askin'ya. I tellin'ya.

139
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:02,301
I had to fight the bitch off
to get my clothes on.

140
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,440
You don't believe me?
Man, I ain't got to prove nothin', blood.

141
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:09,713
- Who I be's in here? Who I be's?
- Hey, Fritz Boy, right?

142
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:12,414
Yeah. You left your
wallet and your watch.

143
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,890
- Yeah, sorry about that,
sweetness. Shut up, y'all.

144
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,484
I was doin' the drinking
thing last night.

145
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,030
I must've walked
into the wrong condo.

146
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:24,397
Or the right condo,
depending on how you see it.

147
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,459
I guess drinking's not for everyone.

148
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,504
Thanks.

149
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:30,870
I do appreciate
what you've done for me, Allen.

150
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:33,637
Just think about
the family, man. Be smart.

151
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,735
I am smart, for God's sake.

152
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,188
Mind if I chill here?

153
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,655
I'm keeping the pot you left.

154
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,716
Call it a room charge.

155
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:53,228
Yeah, that's cool.
That's cool.

156
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:55,992
I can get you some more
of that if you want.

157
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:01,129
I'm sure I'll have no problem
finding drugs on a Caribbean island.

158
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,165
Cayman is a little different
than America.

159
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,403
Gotta have connections.

160
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,015
Fritz.

161
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,186
Pippa.

162
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:28,263
Can you break a hundred?

163
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,300
- Yeah, man. Can break anything.
- Oh.

164
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,036
Looks pretty good.

165
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,235
Very tasty.

166
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,507
- You use some kind of special sauce, right?
- Yo, chicken specialistl

167
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,549
That little brown boy Fritz...
You seen him?

168
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,550
No, king man.

169
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,318
Pippa!

170
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,595
- Where have you been all this time?
- Hey, Dad.

171
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:03,462
I was with Fritz.
He's the son of the manager.

172
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:06,661
- What happenin', Mr. Carl?
- Yeah, pleasure. Let's go.

173
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:09,000
- See you later.
- All right, cool. We'll link later.

174
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,006
C-4, right?

175
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:14,100
Allen, where are you?

176
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:17,169
Call me when you get this.
Or better yet, get your ass over here.

177
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,772
I'm starting to feel
like a fuckin' hostage.

178
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,115
I don't know whether to hang here
or come look for you. C-4.

179
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:42,028
Psst. Pippa?
What happenin'? Come here.

180
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,977
- What are you doing here?
- Shh. Don't wake your father up, man.

181
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:55,677
- He's already sleeping.
- So, what's goin' on? Look at you, girl.

182
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:58,118
You ready or what?
Comin'?

183
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,122
Not tonight.
I'm really jet-lagged.

184
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,283
From Florida?

185
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,418
Come on.
You're talkin' foolishness.

186
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,860
It's your first night.

187
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,364
Gonna be live tonight.
My cousin throwin' a little party.

188
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:11,627
- Fool, come on.
- I can't.

189
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:14,499
I brought you something.

190
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,640
You got this
from the door, stupid.

191
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,735
Look, no, no. I...

192
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:25,576
It's just... I couldn't find one
as pretty as you, of course.

193
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,550
Has that line
ever worked for you?

194
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:31,553
You gonna come, right? Come on, girl.
You know you wanna dance.

195
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:34,055
Shake your thing,
like they say in America.

196
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:36,888
- All right. Let me just get dressed.
- No, no, no, no, no.

197
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,623
It's bad luck to leave a conch shell inside.
What's wrong with you?

198
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,995
I'll take my chances.

199
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:48,101
- What are you doing?
- I left some beers in the fridge.

200
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,503
- What happened to my sheets?
- Okay.

201
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,042
- Wait. Your father. Shh.
- Go. Yeah, my father.

202
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:56,237
- They soft and "caressable" like me, girl.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

203
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:52,468
Fuck.

204
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,703
Oh, God.

205
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:10,577
How come every time I see you,
you've got a different car?

206
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,884
Connections, girl.
This is my island.

207
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:14,890
I run this motherfuckin' rock.

208
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,892
I tellin' ya.
I not askin' ya.

209
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,794
- What did you just say?
- Boo! Run it, girl.

210
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:31,138
This nigga's bad.

211
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,676
Yo, boo, think
she wearin' panties?

212
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,103
- This is lookin' fun.
- Yeah, girl.

213
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:40,809
The party's not happenin' without Fritz.
You know that.

214
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,818
Fuck!

215
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:45,888
Fritz?

216
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,725
Pippa!

217
00:17:52,796 --> 00:17:56,027
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
What's up, sexy?

218
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,124
When are you gonna
give me some of this?

219
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,567
Oh, behavel Jesusl
What the fuck are you doing?

220
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,635
Sorry, big man.

221
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,716
Yo, Fritz! What up?

222
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:24,621
Yo, listen.
It ain't nothin' like that.

223
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,669
- You're not listening to me.
- Since when?

224
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,938
Fuck!

225
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:47,780
I can't believe that Richie grabbed
my fucking vagina on the way in here.

226
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,786
- He's lucky he didn't lose his ring.
- Fuck both of you.

227
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:55,052
Fucking together.

228
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,117
I'm sorry.
Um, can I help you?

229
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:01,095
No. I just...
I saw your iguana.

230
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:06,896
Why don't you sit down, sister?
Take a line off.

231
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:13,801
Everybody get the fuck outl

232
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:18,442
Let's head out.

233
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:32,427
Hammer, some dude outside
lookin' for your sister, yo.

234
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:36,454
Fucking pussyhole.
Got this.

235
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,468
Rich, what goin'on, man?

236
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:43,404
Shoo!
This party live, man.

237
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:48,069
- Whoo, this my juice! Look at this...
- What the fuck you doin'?

238
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:51,011
- Why the rise?
- Shut the fuck up! You crash into my ride.

239
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:54,244
You hop in talkin' about
we're gonna work some shit out.

240
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,444
- Four fuckin' months, nigga?
- Yeah, man, I've been tryin'...

241
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,716
Rich, I've been tryin' to
work somethin' out for you.

242
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,758
The shit better be workin' out
right now, man.

243
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,351
Oh, you know Fritz?

244
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:08,693
It is a small island.
Everybody knows Fritz.

245
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:11,359
Seriously, did he, um,
show you the sunset...

246
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:14,460
or try the one about how
the water's prettier at night?

247
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,903
Um, no.

248
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:20,136
Actually, he, uh...
he gave me a shell.

249
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:25,147
- Watch out. That guy's a land shark.
- You don't understand.

250
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,378
- He left her on the side of the road.
- You want a bump?

251
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:29,816
I got dollars on my brain.

252
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:32,218
Rich, I know, man.
You bad, man. I know that.

253
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,222
Yeah?

254
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,657
I know somewhere where you can get more
than enough money to fix your car right now.

255
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,059
- Tonight. Right now...
- Speak.

256
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,695
Shit. Fuck.

257
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,252
Goddamn jerk chicken.

258
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,289
Do you guys have any pot though?

259
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,723
It really helps me focus.

260
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,387
What are we? Fuckin' Rastas?

261
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:16,228
Season spliff.
Island tradition.

262
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,737
Oh, my God.
Thank you guys so much.

263
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:26,833
You have no idea.
My dad has just been such a jerk.

264
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,313
So, are you just visiting,
or, um, did your dad...

265
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:34,350
start a hedge fund,
fuck the boss and retire early?

266
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,942
Um, neither, really.

267
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,751
She's a lifer, definitely.
You can just see it in her eyes.

268
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:49,795
Welcome to our little island.

269
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,959
Um, do you guys know
where the bathroom is?

270
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:54,230
It's over there.

271
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:01,942
This is fucked up, Eva.

272
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:04,912
She's not gonna last six months.

273
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:07,541
With Fritz, I'd be surprised
if she lasts the weekend.

274
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,551
Slut.

275
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,501
There's somebody in here.

276
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:37,102
Bitch, there's room for two.

277
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:46,144
Here. Have some stabilizer.

278
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:48,816
Courtesy of Rich Boy Rich.

279
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:55,687
Of course, you might know me
as Nigga Rich, behind my back.

280
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,559
I would never use that word.

281
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:03,037
Yo, baby, I don't
give a fuck, all right?

282
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:05,131
I got no chip
on my damn shoulder either.

283
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,711
Stop all that drinking.
Psst! Baby love.

284
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:18,510
- What happened?
- Where the fuck have you been?

285
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:21,113
You just left me.
I don't even know anybody.

286
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,183
I know. I know. I sorry.
Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

287
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,194
Just take me away from here.

288
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:28,992
Pippa, Pippa, anything
them girls say, they lyin'.

289
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,659
They schized-out coke fiends.
Don't listen to them.

290
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,793
I don't care.
Just take me home.

291
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,771
Hey, I can't do that right now.

292
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,967
I'll take you for some fresh air.
Come on. Come on.

293
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,308
Yo, Fritz, don't go out there.
They fightin', man.

294
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:45,711
- Fuck!
- Did he say there's a fight? Who's fightin'?

295
00:23:45,782 --> 00:23:48,717
Some niggas always
got to fuck up a good time.

296
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,878
Let's go to your house.

297
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,884
Pippa? Pippa?

298
00:24:18,648 --> 00:24:20,582
So you cool?

299
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:29,854
Yo, there's this song you need to add
to the soundtrack of your life, girl.

300
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,554
Come on.
You know you love it.

301
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:35,257
I just want to forget
about my life right now.

302
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,960
It's fucked up. I hate my father.

303
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:44,295
No, yo. We gots to forget
about that. Come on, girl.

304
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:47,241
Tonight our night.
We gonna have fun. Come on.

305
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:54,073
This isn't your boat.

306
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,483
Yeah, yo. This...
This my brethren's boat.

307
00:24:57,553 --> 00:25:00,317
My friend.
He cool with it. Don't worry.

308
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,551
It's the quickest way
across the island.

309
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:06,117
No worries, girl.
Here we go now.

310
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:09,562
Here we go.
Ladies first, of course.

311
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,566
Watch your step.

312
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,538
Raw, dude.
Here we go now.

313
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:29,142
Make yourself comfortable,
girl. Sit down.

314
00:25:29,218 --> 00:25:34,019
A little something, Cayman style.

315
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,116
Yeah, sorry about that.
I don't think they got a radio here.

316
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:50,464
Oh, um, I don't drink.

317
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,668
You sure?
It's not that strong, man.

318
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,809
To us. Of course.

319
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,485
You know, Pippa...

320
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,522
it's so crazy...

321
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,683
how you can meet somebody
for the first time...

322
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,818
and feel more connected to them...

323
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:15,125
than the people you've supposedly
known your whole life.

324
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:19,635
I feelin'like you're
this beautiful mango.

325
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:25,968
Ripe. Waiting
for someone to pick you.

326
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,038
Whoa.

327
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:32,206
Central, you on patrol?

328
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:35,182
Yeah, looks like we got
a burglary on Cayman.

329
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:39,649
- Securityl Hello? Oil
- Shit.

330
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:41,485
You bastardsl
On your feet, Fritzyl

331
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,525
I thought this was your friend's boat.

332
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:48,829
Quite a nice Bimmer.
Was it yours?

333
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:52,766
All unitsl All unitsl

334
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,671
Jesus.

335
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,776
Hey, what's all this?

336
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:08,248
Oh, hey, bro.
There was a shootout.

337
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:12,185
Yeah, man.
It's the end of an era.

338
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:22,221
In 1973, there was only one inmate...

339
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:24,232
in the Cayman Islands Prison.

340
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,100
Since that time, there has been
an average of one murder per year.

341
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,639
The majority of these incidents
have fallen under three categories...

342
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:37,406
vehicular homicide...

343
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,914
domestic...

344
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:42,542
or drug-related...

345
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:44,643
all the incidents except one.

346
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,918
On the quiet side of the island, a group
of fishermen engaged in a heated debate.

347
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:52,984
The homicide was witnessed
by the fisherman's seven-year-old son...

348
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:57,294
who for nearly five years
did not say a word to anyone.

349
00:27:57,366 --> 00:28:01,427
This earned him the nickname Shy.

350
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,475
What's up, Shy?

351
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:10,341
Me and the boss takin' the boat out
tonight for some deep-sea fishing.

352
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:13,075
- You won't be needing me later then?
- No, no, no, man.

353
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,083
But I have two bookings
in the morning.

354
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,279
- I want you up and at 'em.
- This one here. We got this last week.

355
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:20,288
You guys are gonna love it.
It's brand-new.

356
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:22,449
- Cheers, Marvin.
- Take it easy, bro.

357
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:24,993
Good evening, sir.

358
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:27,222
- Marvin.
- How's it going, sir?

359
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:30,595
How are you?
This kid here...

360
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:34,067
- He work for me?
- Since high school.

361
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:36,764
Daughters and the wives love him.

362
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,740
You should see when he's working.
The tip jar is full.

363
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:42,676
I'm not running some kind of match
service here, man. Gentlemen.

364
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:09,896
You're home early. You can come
to church with me tomorrow.

365
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:13,066
Oh, Mom, I'd love to,
you know, but I've gotta go to work.

366
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,170
You know why I go to church?
To thank God for my good son.

367
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,682
Well, maybe you can tell
that to the boss then.

368
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:24,413
Or his daughter.

369
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:26,921
Oh, yeah.
I've been hearing things.

370
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:30,152
Mom, church ladies aren't
supposed to be gossiping.

371
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,718
I'm her teacher.
Schoolgirls do.

372
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:35,764
Now, you be careful.

373
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:38,857
You know me, Mom.
I'm always careful.

374
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,567
Two carrot juice
and two fish soup, please.

375
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,670
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. You're welcome very much.

376
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:59,678
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

377
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:02,781
- Fly Guy, Shy and Kimo.
- What's happening?

378
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:05,452
Snort in faith, dog.

379
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:10,488
Yo, Kimo, what's the deal with this switching
chips thing? It seems kind of shady.

380
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:13,626
You mean you been here all these years
and not figured that shit out yet?

381
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:17,139
Look, the barter system.
The sour cream and onions is the weed...

382
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:19,140
and the nacho chips,
that's the cash.

383
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,075
- It's a flawless system.
- Very creative.

384
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:30,883
Who you talkin' about?

385
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:41,253
But, yo, on a real note, check this.

386
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,457
Motherfucker! What'd you do?
Rob the marine supply store?

387
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:45,466
No, dog,
I went on the Internet.

388
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:47,502
Twelve-gauge
is just like a flare, man.

389
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,800
All I gotta do
is file it down a little bit.

390
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:52,670
Crazy fucker.
Hey, go shoot Shy with that.

391
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:56,473
Oh, blood, you need to chill out on him.
Where my 10 dollars is?

392
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:58,479
- Ten dollars for what?
- For what?

393
00:30:58,547 --> 00:31:02,449
I went and got you weed.
And I'm hungry.

394
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:07,519
Here's your 10 dollars.

395
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,990
- Thanks.
- Now get the fuck out of here.

396
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:12,118
You the handle.

397
00:31:12,194 --> 00:31:14,287
- You the blade.
- All right. Later.

398
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,524
Is that Kimo,
the magnificent West Indian?

399
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:55,332
Yo. Yo, dog, I have to go
to school tomorrow.

400
00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:59,273
I know, dog. But it's her birthday, man.
It's her birthday.

401
00:31:59,407 --> 00:32:03,935
You know, ain't never known a brother
so pussy-whipped without gettin' no pussy.

402
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:07,037
You got a filthy mouth
for such a little dog.

403
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:09,048
My dog not little though.

404
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:13,011
- Scrapper.
- Scrapper what?

405
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:15,453
Teeny little scrapper.
Teeny-weeny scrapper.

406
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:19,687
Teeny-weeny nothin'. I'm liftin'
trunks, see? I'm liftin' trunks, see?

407
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:36,842
Her dad's on a fishing trip.
He'll be back in the morning.

408
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:40,278
But if I'm not back in two hours,
come call me. All right?

409
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:42,942
Toss a pebble at that window.
Do you see it?

410
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:46,350
Why don't she just come out
in the bushes and make this easier?

411
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,287
Kimo, this is the way
it works with the nice girls.

412
00:32:49,357 --> 00:32:51,951
One day you'll get yours
and you'll know.

413
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:54,187
I do know she turned legal
about an hour ago...

414
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:57,925
and you better hurry before
them niggers start lining up.

415
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:00,297
Don't be turning on
that ghetto stereo.

416
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:03,599
Look, man, don't be
dissing my pookie, see?

417
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:07,163
You gotta take this bike and go.

418
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:44,510
Are you nervous?
We don't have to do this, you know.

419
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,680
We've got our whole
lives ahead of us.

420
00:33:53,254 --> 00:33:56,587
Shy, what do you want
to do with your life?

421
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:59,353
Besides marry you?

422
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:01,520
Besides marry me.

423
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:05,595
Be serious.

424
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:09,366
I was being serious.

425
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:14,700
I don't know.
But I feel like I've got some time.

426
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,834
I'm not in any particular hurry.

427
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:19,004
See, that's what worries me.

428
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:23,111
You're four years older than me.

429
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:26,779
Three years, technically,
birthday girl.

430
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:32,117
Your life has no direction.

431
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:35,620
All your friends are in high school.

432
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,297
I bet Kimo's outside right now.

433
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:43,827
Somebody's got to keep watch.

434
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,135
I'm just worried that you're
gonna be one of those island boys...

435
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:52,509
that's just stuck on spring break.

436
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:56,516
What are you saying?

437
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:59,178
I'm nothing like
those boys on spring break.

438
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:04,652
I've never made a pass at you, Andrea.
I love you.

439
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:12,591
- No. Shy...
- Let's just...

440
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:19,334
I want this.
I want to do this.

441
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,318
I know you.

442
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:27,632
- Oh, shit.
- What?

443
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:34,339
What?
Do I look like a monster?

444
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:36,906
No, baby.

445
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:40,681
You're beautiful.
But I gotta go.

446
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:44,281
Kimo messed up again.

447
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,353
Don't go.

448
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:51,626
I've got to.
Your dad'll be home.

449
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,306
- Drea?
- Just pretend like you're sleeping.

450
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:41,371
Oh, shit.

451
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:44,576
Come on now.
Open the door.

452
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:48,816
Please. Quiet down, man. Your mom's sleeping.

453
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:50,982
Shit.

454
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:53,583
There's somebody in there.

455
00:37:55,729 --> 00:37:58,527
- Is there a man in there?
- Uh.

456
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:03,464
Hammer!
A man inside her room?

457
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:06,870
Boy, go out and catch him!
Run around front!

458
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:15,138
Open the door for Daddy now.

459
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:19,350
Sweetie, whatever's going on,
you can talk to me.

460
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,615
I have some people
you can talk to. Don't worry.

461
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:36,602
How you been? Can I have some of this?
I'll come back, Mommy.

462
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,231
- Yo, what's up, man?
- I can't believe you didn't wake me up.

463
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:42,241
What am I?
Your pussy watchman?

464
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,301
I need my eight hours.
I must say though, dog, you got skills.

465
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,313
I need to try your
cologne or something.

466
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:50,612
I'm serious. I just hope she doesn't
get in too much trouble, man.

467
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:53,881
Her? You need to worry about
if the Hammer gonna chop you to pieces.

468
00:38:53,954 --> 00:38:57,913
He's a rich boy. The worst he can do
is get his dad to fire me.

469
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,457
You know how he got that name?

470
00:39:01,528 --> 00:39:04,053
- 'Cause he hammers people to pieces?
- No, man.

471
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:06,964
Andrea hit him in the head
with a hammer when he was a kid.

472
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:09,935
He's got a little dent right there.

473
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:12,996
- He had you runnin' though.
- Only 'cause your ass didn't wake me up.

474
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:17,138
- That your ride?
- Yeah.

475
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,805
- Which reminds me.
- Hmm?

476
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,974
- You owe me a bicycle now, dog.
- Come on, man.

477
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,451
Yo, we're all dogs, man.
But, yo, some of us just pedigree.

478
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,047
Kimo! How you doin'?

479
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:32,854
Hey, I'll see you at school.

480
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:35,588
Whitey boy.

481
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:41,368
Why... Why doesn't he like me?

482
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:44,598
Well, you're just not from around here.
That's all.

483
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:46,606
That's cool.

484
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:59,841
Ah, my boy.
What's happenin'?

485
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,753
- It's a day of work.
- The boss not here.

486
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:05,792
Boss not here?
Where is he?

487
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:08,191
- Hey, yo, Antoine.
- Yeah, yo.

488
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:11,322
Someone last night
raped his daughter.

489
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,868
Raped her? Raped her?

490
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:20,700
Yo, I've got to go.

491
00:40:20,774 --> 00:40:22,833
Bro gone mad.

492
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:30,844
When acid is added to the universal
indicator, what color does it turn?

493
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:32,852
Red.

494
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,516
We can then neutralize the acid by adding
small amounts of alkali drop by drop.

495
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:41,493
- And what color does it get to?
- Green.

496
00:40:41,562 --> 00:40:44,497
- Now, make sure that those test tubes...
- Psst. Yo, Keisha.

497
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:48,057
Girl, what's up with you
and this tub o'lovin'?

498
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:51,571
Girl, you know I got
a sickness for the thickness.

499
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:54,163
- Kimo.
- Shy, what are you doin'here?

500
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:57,039
- I'm looking for Andrea. Have you seen her?
- No, man.

501
00:40:57,111 --> 00:41:00,012
Oh, you come to get some more, huh?
A little quickie in the washroom.

502
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,049
You've gotta stop saying that shit, man.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

503
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:07,544
Yo, Shy, you were
at my house this morning.

504
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:10,886
That was you, motherfucker.
I saw you.

505
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:13,859
You come to my house,
and you rape my sister.

506
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:16,623
- No, no, no. I didn't rape your sister, man.
- I saw you there.

507
00:41:16,697 --> 00:41:18,722
You lie to me about raping
my fucking sister?

508
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:21,461
- You fuck with my father's name.
- I didn't rape your sister.

509
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:25,938
You fuck with my family name, huh?

510
00:41:26,006 --> 00:41:29,237
Fight! Fight!

511
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:32,608
Break it up! Break it up!

512
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,274
I want you, you and you
to the office right now! Let's go!

513
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,945
Man.

514
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,217
I don't want you to worry, baby.

515
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:49,554
But you have to understand this is not a...
some kind of innocent mischief.

516
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,894
This is a serious situation here.

517
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:53,899
We make mistakes.

518
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:55,901
It wasn't a mistake.

519
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:58,494
Darling, you don't
understand what love is.

520
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:00,437
You don't know man-woman love.

521
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:05,501
I will talk to the police.
I will handle all the legal concerns.

522
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:10,107
- But why?
- This boy, he come in through a window...

523
00:42:10,184 --> 00:42:14,143
- I let him in.
- You never let no one in your house!

524
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:16,989
Eh?

525
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:19,389
You let him in for what?

526
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,258
To steal the first night
of your womanhood?

527
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:26,165
Am I to put bars on the window?

528
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,165
- Shy.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

529
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:30,362
What happened here?
Why were you here today?

530
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:32,735
I'm serious, kid.
It's gangster, bro.

531
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:34,740
This is...
This is beyond...

532
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:36,867
Once you do this,
then there no coming back.

533
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:39,208
It was just some mix-up.
One of the gangster kids...

534
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:41,543
You've gotta leave this
school yard stuff behind.

535
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:44,049
- I know.
- You know how I feel about fighting.

536
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:47,484
Don't touch this shit.
I don't even want this on me, bro.

537
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:51,115
I don't pick fights.
Look at this face. It takes after you.

538
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:53,523
- Come on.
- Stop it.

539
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:56,324
- Hey, you the handle.
- You the blade, man.

540
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:36,132
Hey, yo, for real, though,
what happened with you and Hammer?

541
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:38,933
I mean he can't
let this shit go? Move.

542
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:40,940
Yeah, that shit goes way back.

543
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:44,705
He came and worked with us one summer down
at the dock, trying to impress his father.

544
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:50,613
My future brother-in-law, man. He's got
a whole lot of proving to do to the world, yo.

545
00:43:50,684 --> 00:43:53,152
Yeah, but he gotta be
jealous too, though, man.

546
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,381
I mean the brother
not blessed with good looks.

547
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:58,424
- I prettier than him. In fact, he ugly, dog.
- You're such a pretty boy.

548
00:43:58,492 --> 00:44:00,517
Ah, move, move.

549
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:05,622
And, yo, I'm serious
about that bike, dog!

550
00:44:16,877 --> 00:44:20,074
- Yo, Hammer, what are you doing, man?
This is my house.

551
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:25,043
Fuck! Fuck!

552
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:34,082
Fuck, Hammer!

553
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:53,672
Andrea...

554
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,733
do you know why you've been made
to come to these sessions?

555
00:45:57,811 --> 00:46:00,405
Because I had a little sex.

556
00:46:01,848 --> 00:46:04,544
Just like every other girl my age.

557
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:08,921
I don't understand
what's the big deal.

558
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:12,425
I see you're getting
really upset about this.

559
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:14,255
Let's talk about something else.

560
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:17,319
Yeah, let's talk about something else.

561
00:46:17,397 --> 00:46:20,264
Let's talk about Shy.

562
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:25,503
No! We're not gonna
fucking talk about Shy.

563
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:29,541
Leave him alone.

564
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:34,341
Have you tried
reaching out to him?

565
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,688
He used to call me...
on his bad days.

566
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,024
He don't want to see me though.

567
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,398
He don't want to see anybody.

568
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:02,231
Have you ever been in love?

569
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:06,645
Yeah.

570
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:13,211
I'm gonna go now.

571
00:47:13,286 --> 00:47:16,483
Just tell my daddy
I stayed the full hour.

572
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:19,992
Fuck it.
Write whatever you want.

573
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,832
Hey, today Friday the 13th.

574
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,777
Nobody don't go fishing
on the 13th.

575
00:47:39,846 --> 00:47:43,282
Yeah, Shy. It's bad luck, man.
You better stay ashore today.

576
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,514
But if you want, you can come
and play a game of dominoes with us.

577
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:51,117
Poor sufferer.

578
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:18,676
You know, they released
your brother today.

579
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:21,778
- He a little gangster now.
- Shut the fuck up.

580
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:28,227
So what? We ain't gonna
be able to hang no more?

581
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:32,527
What's the deal? You want me
to just take you home?

582
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:36,434
Huh?

583
00:48:36,503 --> 00:48:38,437
No.

584
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:44,474
I want you to take me somewhere
and fuck the shit out of me.

585
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:16,340
What's up, big man?

586
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:24,945
You're like a ghost
in broad daylight.

587
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:27,780
I never see you no more.

588
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:33,950
I've been here.
Or out fishing, you know.

589
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:38,553
For real though. I...
I've been wondering if you're all right.

590
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:43,259
I'm survivin', you know.

591
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:46,771
Put a CD player in the pookie.

592
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:50,939
You know, you should
roll out tonight.

593
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:53,876
Richie is having his birthday bash.

594
00:49:53,945 --> 00:49:56,880
It's gonna be
a "pootenanny" holiday.

595
00:49:56,948 --> 00:49:58,609
I'll catch you later, yo.

596
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:03,143
Correction. You can't just expect
to drop out of the world, man.

597
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:05,155
It's just looks.

598
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:08,556
You're still the same person.
You're my dog.

599
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:11,852
It's just looks.

600
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:17,126
You wanna try
walking around like this?

601
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:26,734
I'm trying to
keep my heart clean, Kimo.

602
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:36,076
It was just a pebble at a window, bro.

603
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,382
It was just a pebble
at a fucking window!

604
00:50:45,764 --> 00:50:48,164
I will sue this government.

605
00:50:48,233 --> 00:50:52,499
They keep my boy in jail for four months
with no evidence, no testimony, nothin'.

606
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,902
Four monthsl

607
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:59,171
And they can't find the fool... the animal
that molest me poor daughter?

608
00:50:59,244 --> 00:51:01,542
My princess.

609
00:51:04,382 --> 00:51:06,714
And you, Mr. Hammer.

610
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,284
You disgrace my name.
You disgrace my family!

611
00:51:11,356 --> 00:51:14,291
Only one thing I do when you were born...
I give you a name.

612
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:18,489
You're not some pygmy in a bush!
You's a Sterling!

613
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:20,497
When them judge you,
them judge me.

614
00:51:20,565 --> 00:51:23,033
And no man judge me!

615
00:51:23,101 --> 00:51:27,197
If you run with them assholes,
you come out and you smell like shit.

616
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:30,264
But you don't bring that shit
near the Sterling door.

617
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:35,211
Is that why you didn't come get me from jail?

618
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:39,508
- It's not a good time.
- For me either.

619
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:41,575
No. Hold on.

620
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:43,917
Who's that on the phone?

621
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:46,582
None of your business.

622
00:51:49,227 --> 00:51:51,161
I'm here.

623
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:53,720
I need to talk to you.

624
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:56,733
Shy, this is gonna get really complicated.

625
00:51:56,801 --> 00:51:59,235
You cannot be in my life right now.

626
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:01,534
Eh? I can't what?

627
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:03,597
What are you saying, baby?

628
00:52:05,176 --> 00:52:07,610
You sound so grown-up.

629
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,011
That's what happens
when you leave someone alone.

630
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:13,016
I didn't leave you, baby.

631
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:15,109
I didn't.

632
00:52:15,186 --> 00:52:20,249
I'd never leave you, honey.
I just needed a little bit of time.

633
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:26,024
And we got plenty of that.

634
00:52:26,097 --> 00:52:30,056
Remember? Isn't that what you said?
Take all the time you need.

635
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:32,729
And when you're ready...

636
00:52:32,804 --> 00:52:35,796
come out from your
fucking hiding place.

637
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,802
- Andrea...
- Just not...

638
00:52:39,878 --> 00:52:42,312
Just not now.

639
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:42,362
Hey, mate. I got your call.
Do you want to get a drink or anything?

640
00:53:57,822 --> 00:54:00,723
Listen.

641
00:54:02,093 --> 00:54:04,027
Andrea's not the girl...

642
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:06,086
you used to know.

643
00:54:07,732 --> 00:54:11,463
I mean, there's...
there's been a lot of talk.

644
00:54:13,404 --> 00:54:15,565
- A lot of boys.
- Shut up.

645
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,632
- A lot of men.
- Shut the fuck up.

646
00:54:19,944 --> 00:54:22,242
- I'm sorry.
- No need to say it.

647
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:29,386
You're too good for her, man.

648
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:31,183
Stop saying that.

649
00:54:34,759 --> 00:54:37,250
Have you ever really loved, Patrick?

650
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:44,366
Real love with someone
you can be with.

651
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:08,282
Let's go. Come on.

652
00:55:19,837 --> 00:55:22,635
- Where's your friend at?
- She's coming now.

653
00:55:28,313 --> 00:55:30,611
Hey, yo, yo, yol

654
00:55:30,682 --> 00:55:32,616
What's up, ladies?
What's up?

655
00:55:32,684 --> 00:55:35,414
- Happy birthday.
- Yeah? So, yo, yo, yo.

656
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:38,080
Come here. When you gon' give me
some of this, huh?

657
00:55:38,156 --> 00:55:40,989
Oh, behave. Jesus!
What the fuck are you doing?

658
00:55:43,962 --> 00:55:47,159
Stingy bitch.
Not even a little birthday pussy, huh?

659
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:50,166
Nah, youngster.
See, that's the herd mentality.

660
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:53,169
See, you tryin' to fuck
the cute one, right?

661
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:56,968
But if that fails, then you find
the youngest, weakest...

662
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,976
dirtiest member of the crew
and you take 'em down.

663
00:56:00,044 --> 00:56:01,978
Got it?

664
00:56:03,214 --> 00:56:05,148
I'm Hammer, man.

665
00:56:05,216 --> 00:56:07,207
Nigga, I know who you are.

666
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:10,587
This nigga, man.

667
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:13,590
Hey, yo, boo, go get this nigga
some jumbo shrimp, man.

668
00:56:13,658 --> 00:56:17,185
Come on, kid. Let's get this party crackin'
in this motherfucker, man!

669
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:19,661
Sorry, man.

670
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:23,167
This is not my scene, mate.

671
00:56:23,234 --> 00:56:25,828
I'm sure you can handle it.

672
00:56:36,814 --> 00:56:39,112
A season spliff lifts.

673
00:56:53,698 --> 00:56:55,689
Shy. Shy! Shy!

674
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:58,792
Couple of chairs down here, mate.

675
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:13,876
I'm sorry. Um, can I help you?

676
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:17,512
I tellin' ya, it had to be
at least a hundred grand...

677
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:19,988
still countin'cash.

678
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:23,755
So, what you sayin'? We should just
kick down his door, take his shit?

679
00:57:23,828 --> 00:57:26,126
No, big man.

680
00:57:26,197 --> 00:57:28,392
Go through the front door, yo.

681
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:29,990
I like that.

682
00:57:31,602 --> 00:57:33,934
If this goes wrong...

683
00:57:34,005 --> 00:57:35,939
you better leave the island.

684
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:37,998
S.

685
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:42,339
Fritz.

686
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,948
Shut the fuckin' door, bloods.

687
00:57:57,028 --> 00:57:58,962
Get off me!

688
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,895
Bitch!

689
00:58:10,775 --> 00:58:13,266
Stop all that drinking.
Psstl Baby love.

690
00:58:13,344 --> 00:58:17,212
- What are you doing here?
- Get off me! Don't touch me!

691
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:22,044
Your face.

692
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:26,151
Are you high?

693
00:58:26,224 --> 00:58:29,159
- No. I'm not high.
- Are you high? You're high.

694
00:58:29,227 --> 00:58:31,457
Get off of her.

695
00:58:31,529 --> 00:58:33,588
No, Hammer!

696
00:58:33,664 --> 00:58:35,757
- Come on!

697
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,974

The way I see it, you're my walking trophy.

705
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:09,431
So all these pussy-tail wanna-be niggas
know who the real deal is.

706
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,436
You stay away from my sister before
I fuck up the other side of your face. Huh?

707
00:59:13,504 --> 00:59:16,337

01:00:01,686 --> 01:00:06,214
Yo, Hammer!
Come on, man. Let's roll.

723
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,225
Fuck them niggas
bringin'drama and shit.

724
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:42,485
Are you Patrick?

725
01:00:44,462 --> 01:00:46,453
I'm Andrea.

726
01:00:54,105 --> 01:00:56,972
Listen, do you...
do you know of anywhere, um...

727
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:59,771
anywhere we could find him,
anyplace special?

728
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:02,039
Every place was special.

729
01:01:02,113 --> 01:01:03,740
Hmm.

730
01:01:03,814 --> 01:01:06,374
What?

731
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:09,749
- What does that mean?
- Just tell me where I can find him.

732
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,587
How the fuck should I know? I don't know
where he goes and he hides right now.

733
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:17,093
No, he's changed.
He's changed a lot.

734
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:21,154
You have no idea. God, do you have
any concept of what he's been through?

735
01:01:21,232 --> 01:01:24,827
- I know what he's done to me.
- Oh!

736
01:01:24,902 --> 01:01:26,927
Yeah.
I've seen you at school.

737
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,974
I know what you've become.

738
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:33,977
I know what you've become.

739
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:37,913
You're not worth a second of his time.
Not one second!

740
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:40,610
And he worships you. He...

741
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:43,620
He never stops talking about you,
never stops thinking about you.

742
01:01:43,688 --> 01:01:47,249
And I have no idea why. Why?

743
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,694
You tell me something.

744
01:01:51,762 --> 01:01:55,823
Do you keep a picture of him
on your bedside?

745
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,027
You absolutely fucking disgust me.

746
01:02:00,071 --> 01:02:02,938
- I'm sorry, Patrick...
- Oh, don't apologize to me.

747
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,942
- In fact, get out of my car.
- No. Let's go find him.

748
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:10,106
How dare you.
Get out of my car. Get the fuck...

749
01:02:10,181 --> 01:02:12,547
- No...
- Get out of my car! Get out!

750
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:18,216
Fine!

751
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:20,280
Go!

752
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:28,858
- You sure you wanna do this?
- What?

753
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:31,800
Yo, Rich, you don't know me...

754
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:35,498
but I'm the first to roll
on any motherfucker who fuck with me.

755
01:02:35,573 --> 01:02:39,202
But we're gonna smash in
and rob some tourists?

756
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:42,871
Some guests of the island who didn't fuck
with anybody? Sounds messed up.

757
01:02:45,683 --> 01:02:48,049
You know what?

758
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:50,451
You gotta get out.

759
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:52,546
- See...
- Come on, man.

760
01:02:52,623 --> 01:02:56,081
I know where you're coming from.
I understand.

761
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,160
- But this shit is different.
- We need to keep our business to ourselves -

762
01:03:00,161 --> 01:03:01,664
and not the tourists.

763
01:03:01,665 --> 01:03:04,998
- Fuck, they're our bread and butter.
- Maybe for you, Hammer.

764
01:03:05,069 --> 01:03:07,833
You my boy and shit,
your family is rich...

765
01:03:07,905 --> 01:03:11,033
but, dog, you just don't
understand this stuff.

766
01:03:11,108 --> 01:03:13,076
- Fuckin' bar tip boy.
- He's right.

767
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:15,578
He's right.
You don't understand.

768
01:03:15,646 --> 01:03:17,409
You can't understand.

769
01:03:17,481 --> 01:03:21,042
I gotta get a piece, man.

770
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:25,378
By the hook or by the crook.

771
01:03:28,325 --> 01:03:30,759
Yeah, dog. You the handle.

772
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:50,878
- Yo, be Shy goin' there.
- I see him, man.

773
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:52,939
- Ask if gonna be there.
- All right.

774
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,754
Shy.

775
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:07,489
- Nigga Rich's party.
- Nigga Rich's party?

776
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:23,139
- Where they going now?
- They goin' Willie's.

777
01:04:23,214 --> 01:04:26,012
- Willie's?
- Yeah.

778
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,948
But I catch you later.

779
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:32,955
- Thanks, boys.
- All right.

780
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,820
You look worried, man.

781
01:05:11,294 --> 01:05:14,354
You're safe.

782
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,594
Tell me a secret, something
you've never told anybody else.

783
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:21,000
Never told anyone before...

784
01:05:24,474 --> 01:05:27,409
I fantasize about making love to you.

785
01:05:27,477 --> 01:05:29,172
- What?
- No!

786
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:32,911
That is not fair.

787
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:36,875
I love you.

788
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:54,261
Oh, I, uh...

789
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:57,329
filled out my applications
for university yesterday.

790
01:05:57,407 --> 01:05:59,341
I'm thinking law or business...

791
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:01,707
something that makes lots of money.

792
01:06:01,778 --> 01:06:05,680
Stupid people make money
these days, Patrick.

793
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:08,683
Clever ones just help them
look after it.

794
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:11,049
Times have changed.

795
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,111
What do you mean?

796
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,224
What do I mean?

797
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:20,490
I have a client in Miami...
high school educated.

798
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:23,498
One day some friends, and friends of friends,
come along and say to him...

799
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:27,263
"Would you mind very much
looking after some money for me?"

800
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:29,770
Paid cash for his trouble.

801
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,535
And, uh, then, of course,
he needs someone...

802
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:37,944
to help him introduce the cash into
the banking system here... invest it, hide it.

803
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:40,244
Eh?

804
01:06:40,316 --> 01:06:43,911
So that's it.
We all get little droppings.

805
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:47,912
Putting a clean face on dirty money.

806
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:52,258
Dad, do you...

807
01:06:52,328 --> 01:06:54,489
do you not like what you do?

808
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:59,063
I'm looking for the prospectus
for the condo property.

809
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,605
Uh, I must have left it
back in the office, sir.

810
01:07:03,673 --> 01:07:06,608
Yeah, I bring you to Miami
for two fucking hours.

811
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:10,168
You bring a roller case full of fuck-knows-
what and forget the most important...

812
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:13,181
Allen.
Welcome to Florida.

813
01:07:13,249 --> 01:07:16,514
- Good to see you.
- You guys have a good trip in?

814
01:07:16,586 --> 01:07:19,817
- A few hiccups. This is my assistant, Sheila.
- Yes, we've met.

815
01:07:19,889 --> 01:07:23,450
- Oh, really?
- Cayman, briefly.

816
01:07:23,526 --> 01:07:25,460
I think it was at church.
Right?

817
01:07:25,528 --> 01:07:27,792
That's right. That's right.
At church.

818
01:07:27,864 --> 01:07:30,355
- That's right. I forgot.
- You went to church?

819
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:35,632
Yeah, on my last trip I decided to go
and take in some of the local experience.

820
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:37,969
- It's good seeing you again.
- You too.

821
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,974
That's quite a bag you got there.

822
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:43,534
You guys moving to Miami,
or am I about to sign my life away?

823
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,850
My sincerest apologies,
Mr. Ridley...

824
01:07:48,918 --> 01:07:51,182
but there's some stuff
I need to fax you later.

825
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:53,188
Carl. Please.

826
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:56,419
And, uh, use my home fax.
Easiest thing in the world.

827
01:07:56,492 --> 01:07:58,483
- Uh, we, uh...
- That's okay.

828
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:02,190
- Is this your first time to the States?
- Yes, sir.

829
01:08:02,265 --> 01:08:05,462
- Check the office voice mail. Should we talk?
- You bet.

830
01:08:05,535 --> 01:08:08,231
Hey, I'll look forward
to getting those papers.

831
01:08:14,043 --> 01:08:18,139
Allen, look, I've been really
thinking this over, and...

832
01:08:18,214 --> 01:08:21,149
I think this is the end of it...
I'm out.

833
01:08:21,217 --> 01:08:24,448
I feel it's just time
to take the high road.

834
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,422
We can deal differently,
you know.

835
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:31,517
- We can go into hedge funds, bonds...
- No, no, that's not my style.

836
01:08:31,594 --> 01:08:33,834
What are you gonna do with
all the money under the mattress?

837
01:08:33,835 --> 01:08:35,265
What about the condo?

838
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:37,232
I invest 1.5, I don't even...

839
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,234
Mr. Ridley's a very nice man.

840
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,361
Fancy him?

841
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,498
No, sir.

842
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:49,103
I saw you.

843
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:54,414
Lingering handshakes.

844
01:08:55,418 --> 01:08:58,080
Well, he's very powerful.

845
01:08:58,154 --> 01:09:02,022
- Allen, we discussed this.
- He's very rich.

846
01:09:02,091 --> 01:09:04,184
The more you earn,
the less you keep.

847
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,694
In that case, I should've just
brought in cash.

848
01:09:06,762 --> 01:09:08,889
I could've gotten it
for a million even.

849
01:09:08,965 --> 01:09:11,399
You want to walk into a Realtor
with a million dollars in cash?

850
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:14,402
Didn't do a fucking thing.

851
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:17,371
Say, you'd make a good team,
wouldn't you?

852
01:10:10,993 --> 01:10:14,190
Yes, this is Mr. Allen
from the Cayman Islands.

853
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:16,288
Special Agent Martinez.

854
01:10:16,365 --> 01:10:18,833
Enforcement.

855
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:23,497
Hi! How's it going?
Thanks for getting back to me so soon.

856
01:10:24,774 --> 01:10:27,834
No, I was just with him yesterday.
Hold on.

857
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:30,845
What was the number
to Mr. Ridley's condo?

858
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:32,847
C-4.
Sorry.

859
01:10:35,284 --> 01:10:37,047
Fax.

860
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:41,746
No, they're on their way now.

861
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:45,093
Uh, excuse me, sir?

862
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:47,288
Are we allowed to
fax bank statements?

863
01:10:47,363 --> 01:10:49,354
Just fucking do it, will you!

864
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:51,423
Sorry. Go ahead.

865
01:10:53,202 --> 01:10:56,228
Jesus, you guys work fast,
don't you?

866
01:11:09,552 --> 01:11:11,486
Hello. Mr. Allen's office.

867
01:11:11,554 --> 01:11:13,715
Sheila? It's Carl.
Can you talk?

868
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:16,189
Oh, Carl.
I'm so glad you called.

869
01:11:16,258 --> 01:11:18,488
No, no, me first.
I feel like an ass.

870
01:11:18,561 --> 01:11:21,530
- Sheila?
- That whole charade with your boss.

871
01:11:22,765 --> 01:11:25,393
- Sheila!
- Hello?

872
01:11:29,805 --> 01:11:32,103
Coming, Mr. Allen!

873
01:11:37,947 --> 01:11:39,915
Dad! You got a fax!

874
01:11:39,982 --> 01:11:43,884
Take this down to the post room,
get it packed up for shipping.

875
01:11:46,722 --> 01:11:48,713
So why are you leaving?

876
01:11:48,858 --> 01:11:53,955
Do you know the thing about the Cayman
Islands? You know about the tax thing.

877
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:56,020
Enlighten me.

878
01:11:57,933 --> 01:12:00,026
Years ago...

879
01:12:00,102 --> 01:12:04,971
18th century, this place was just
all bushes and fishermen.

880
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,031
There was a storm.

881
01:12:08,277 --> 01:12:11,872
A convoy of ships
was crashed on the reef...

882
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:16,247
and the locals risked their lives
to go out and help the passengers...

883
01:12:16,318 --> 01:12:21,153
one of whom turned out to be the son
of King George III of England.

884
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:24,485
And His Majesty was so pleased...

885
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,494
that his son's life had been spared...

886
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:30,555
that he decreed the Cayman Islands
had paid their dues to the crown...

887
01:12:30,633 --> 01:12:32,567
and would never again
have to pay taxes.

888
01:12:32,635 --> 01:12:34,762
Hundreds of years later...

889
01:12:34,837 --> 01:12:37,704
the locals took it upon themselves...

890
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:42,005
to open up that privilege to the rest
of the fucking world, made a fucking mint.

891
01:12:42,077 --> 01:12:44,272
- They fucking did, didn't they?
- Yeah.

892
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:48,680
That's why the roads are all paved
and the streets are fucking clean.

893
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:52,312
Because the locals know
how to work the fucking system.

894
01:12:53,956 --> 01:12:57,050
That's what I want you to do...
just help me work the fucking system.

895
01:12:57,126 --> 01:13:00,061
- How?
- Well...

896
01:13:00,129 --> 01:13:01,994
you're a senior manager.

897
01:13:02,064 --> 01:13:04,999
That means you can
sign off on my account...

898
01:13:05,067 --> 01:13:08,161
make deposits over time...

899
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:10,205
on my behalf.

900
01:13:10,272 --> 01:13:12,263
And where are you gonna be?

901
01:13:14,376 --> 01:13:18,210
I'll let you have the house as well.
I'll be offshore.

902
01:13:19,248 --> 01:13:21,739
Or in prison.

903
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:23,944
I'll be rich.

904
01:13:24,019 --> 01:13:26,180
Rich white men don't go to prison.

905
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:29,180
I'll drink to that.

906
01:13:29,258 --> 01:13:32,455
- You're a good man.
- Cheers.

907
01:13:33,896 --> 01:13:37,855
Do you want me to tell you
what we're gonna do?

908
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:44,198
Bullshit, yo.

909
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:47,141
I'm gonna take her inside.

910
01:13:47,209 --> 01:13:50,804
Why don't you take our boy
down to see Powell.

911
01:13:54,483 --> 01:13:57,043
Fuck, man.

912
01:13:58,153 --> 01:14:00,144
This way, miss.

913
01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:06,222
What the fuck kind of thing
they dealin' with now?

914
01:14:15,938 --> 01:14:18,236
So, according to this young lady...

915
01:14:18,307 --> 01:14:21,242
when she and the other gentleman
got down to the dock...

916
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,370
the glass on the boat
was already smashed.

917
01:14:24,446 --> 01:14:27,381
- Who is this other gentleman?
- Oh, I don't know.

918
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:30,350
He got away,
so we couldn't catch him.

919
01:14:30,419 --> 01:14:32,250
Likely some local.

920
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:34,585
Mr. Allen, he's a lawyer. Right?

921
01:14:37,927 --> 01:14:39,861
Allen.

922
01:14:39,929 --> 01:14:42,625
Get the phone.

923
01:14:48,003 --> 01:14:49,766
Hello?

924
01:14:49,838 --> 01:14:52,398
Allen! Wake up!

925
01:14:52,474 --> 01:14:55,773
- Wake up. It's the police.
- Mmm.

926
01:14:55,844 --> 01:14:58,312
What?

927
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,577
Ridley?
Is he on the island?

928
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:04,778
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

929
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:11,826
Allen, where are you?

930
01:15:11,894 --> 01:15:14,886
- I left five messages.
- He called several times during the day.

931
01:15:14,964 --> 01:15:17,091
Why didn't you fucking tell me?

932
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:19,100
You're completely drunk.

933
01:15:21,036 --> 01:15:25,234
Remember when we first came here,
we used to sit by the ocean?

934
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:27,468
You liked the smell.

935
01:15:28,978 --> 01:15:31,913
When was the last time
you smelled the ocean?

936
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:33,949
Shut up.

937
01:15:34,016 --> 01:15:36,814
Turn the light off.

938
01:15:45,527 --> 01:15:47,688
Get out of the fucking car.

939
01:15:49,865 --> 01:15:51,856
Walk.

940
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:14,882
What goin' on, Officer Powell?

941
01:16:14,957 --> 01:16:16,948
What happenin'?

942
01:16:18,994 --> 01:16:22,430
You know, Fritz,
I been on to you for some time.

943
01:16:22,498 --> 01:16:26,332
Borrowing of the cars,
boats, condos.

944
01:16:26,402 --> 01:16:29,633
I mean, I expect it
from the spring breakers, but you?

945
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:32,196
You live your whole life
on vacation.

946
01:16:32,274 --> 01:16:34,970
You know what I think it is?

947
01:16:35,044 --> 01:16:37,979
You're a fucking whitewashed,
wanna-be American.

948
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:40,481
You don't fit in amongst the locals...

949
01:16:40,549 --> 01:16:43,746
so you leech off of the next batch
of fucked-up girls...

950
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:46,253
that want a fling
with a little island monkey.

951
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:48,585
I'm talking to you.
Look at me.

952
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:53,219
Don't fit in? Officer Powell,
my family been here six generations.

953
01:16:53,295 --> 01:16:55,263
Since tightropes and turtle nets.

954
01:16:55,330 --> 01:17:01,064
I think I can stick my dick in any piece
of sexy white beef I feel is worthy...

955
01:17:03,072 --> 01:17:04,699
What you doing?

956
01:17:04,773 --> 01:17:07,537
- Where's your father?
- Uh, I don't know.

957
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:09,543
- You don't know?
- Don't know where your father is?

958
01:17:09,611 --> 01:17:12,876
Where are you living? Where are you staying?

959
01:17:12,948 --> 01:17:15,883
How do you not know
where your father is?

960
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:19,682
- We just got here. I don't know.
- You don't know much, do you?

961
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:24,283
Look at you, leeching off the rich,
living other people's lives.

962
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:26,293
The bloody boats.

963
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:28,295
- Come on!
- And the cars.

964
01:17:28,363 --> 01:17:31,059
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- And the condos.

965
01:17:43,278 --> 01:17:45,974
Allen.

966
01:17:46,048 --> 01:17:48,448
Jesus Christ, man.
Am I glad to see you.

967
01:17:48,517 --> 01:17:50,451
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry, man.

968
01:17:50,519 --> 01:17:53,215
I called your office, your house.
I must've left 10 messages.

969
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:55,222
I had no idea.
I've just been busy.

970
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,224
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

971
01:17:57,292 --> 01:18:00,455
Pippa's gone. I... I don't even know
where to begin to look.

972
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:02,429
Pippa's at the police station.

973
01:18:02,498 --> 01:18:04,762
- The police station?
- Yeah.

974
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:07,768
- What happened?
- She just got taken in for something.

975
01:18:07,836 --> 01:18:10,236
It's no big deal. She's fine.
That's why I'm here.

976
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:12,239
What are you doing on the island?

977
01:18:12,307 --> 01:18:16,744
They came at me hard...
warrants, subpoenas.

978
01:18:16,812 --> 01:18:18,746
Barely got to the bank in time.

979
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:22,443
- It's a good thing you sent that fax.
- Yeah. Which fax?

980
01:18:22,518 --> 01:18:25,453
Oh, the one... Yeah, Sheila sent it
first thing this morning.

981
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:27,580
About the condo.
Yeah, that is lucky.

982
01:18:27,656 --> 01:18:32,116
Fuck, they just... No warning?
They just come down on you?

983
01:18:32,194 --> 01:18:36,290
That's too bad, man.
I can't believe that.

984
01:18:36,365 --> 01:18:39,528
- I thought you had connections.
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

985
01:18:39,601 --> 01:18:42,035
You said that Pippa's okay?

986
01:18:42,104 --> 01:18:44,470
Yeah, she's fine.

987
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,474
We should go and get her.

988
01:18:46,542 --> 01:18:48,533
Let me just grab a couple things.

989
01:18:50,345 --> 01:18:52,279
Fuck!

990
01:18:52,347 --> 01:18:54,315
Son of a fucking bitch!

991
01:18:59,988 --> 01:19:03,389
Fuck, they just... No warning?
They just come down on you?

992
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:06,393
- Which fax?
- Dad, you got a fax!

993
01:19:06,461 --> 01:19:09,294
Sheila sent it first thing this morning.
About the condo.

994
01:19:09,364 --> 01:19:11,958
Special Agent Martinez.

995
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:25,403
Traveling light?

996
01:19:26,715 --> 01:19:29,183
Heavy enough.

997
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:31,242
Let's go.

998
01:19:35,357 --> 01:19:39,259
Hey, Carl. You should put that somewhere
safe, if that's what I think it is.

999
01:19:39,328 --> 01:19:41,262
Let's just get to the station.

1000
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:43,924
- I wanna see my daughter.
- You're on the run from the feds.

1001
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:47,366
You wanna turn up at the police station
with a bag of incriminating evidence?

1002
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:01,010
You are a fucking adultl

1003
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:03,074
Act like it!

1004
01:20:08,757 --> 01:20:11,089
Let me tell you something, Fritz.

1005
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:16,461
I'd better not see you even riding in a car
if your name is not on the deed. Understand?

1006
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:21,764
Not even to borrow your mum's
piece of shit wagon to get groceries.

1007
01:20:21,837 --> 01:20:26,467
Because if I find you in a car,
I'm gonna beat you...

1008
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:29,772
and throw you in the swamp!

1009
01:20:30,846 --> 01:20:33,781
We huntin' some
imaginary people, bro.

1010
01:20:33,849 --> 01:20:36,545
It's a nice crib though.

1011
01:20:36,618 --> 01:20:39,485
Sick fuck.

1012
01:20:39,554 --> 01:20:41,886
Fuckin' empty!

1013
01:20:41,957 --> 01:20:44,551
I'm gon' kill Fritz, man.
I'm gon' kill him!

1014
01:20:44,626 --> 01:20:48,528
Wherever I see him,
I don't care... I'm gon' kill him!

1015
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:52,294
If I have to find the girl,
they'll have to find your body!

1016
01:20:52,367 --> 01:20:54,301
Why, dude...

1017
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:57,065
- Where are my fuckin' glasses?
- I don't know!

1018
01:20:57,139 --> 01:20:59,130
Christ.

1019
01:21:26,601 --> 01:21:29,035
Shy, you're gonna kill me now?

1020
01:21:29,104 --> 01:21:32,335
What the fuck did I do to you? Huh?

1021
01:21:34,543 --> 01:21:38,673
I lived to love your sister.
What was so fuckin' wrong with that?

1022
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:41,375
Fuck you.

1023
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:44,977
- That wasn't love.
- What the fuck do you know about love? Huh?

1024
01:21:46,722 --> 01:21:49,316
Do you know what it means
to love? Do you?

1025
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:53,851
Do you know what it means to look
into someone's eyes, someone you love?

1026
01:21:55,731 --> 01:21:57,756
Do you?

1027
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:59,824
She was so fucking innocent, man.

1028
01:21:59,902 --> 01:22:02,837
She was so pure,
and she loved me.

1029
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:07,540
You fuckin' embarrassed
my family, Shy.

1030
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:10,544
My sister had everything
before she started dealin' with you.

1031
01:22:10,612 --> 01:22:15,208
- I just saw her being fucked in a toilet!
- And who's fault is that? Huh?

1032
01:22:15,284 --> 01:22:18,219
What does she got now?
She's better off now, is she?

1033
01:22:18,287 --> 01:22:23,224
She's fucking better off being fucked
in a cubicle by some fucking stranger?

1034
01:22:26,328 --> 01:22:30,230
I can't stand you, brethren.
That's the way it is.

1035
01:22:31,466 --> 01:22:33,525
This didn't scar me, man.

1036
01:22:33,602 --> 01:22:35,433
You scarred her.

1037
01:22:36,438 --> 01:22:39,168
Fucking live with that.

1038
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:41,573
You fucking live with that.
You.

1039
01:22:43,845 --> 01:22:46,780
Bloody been in here for 48 hours.

1040
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:52,718
I put it in first thing on Monday.
Cash business as usual.

1041
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:55,757
It's too big.

1042
01:22:55,824 --> 01:22:57,815
I got it.

1043
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:01,994
Only two people in the world
know this combination...

1044
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:04,396
me and God.

1045
01:23:04,466 --> 01:23:06,798
And he's too busy to remember.

1046
01:23:08,403 --> 01:23:11,395
Don't worry. Come on.
Let's go and find her.

1047
01:23:13,008 --> 01:23:15,374
Put this jewelry somewhere now.

1048
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:18,703
What the fuck?

1049
01:23:23,352 --> 01:23:25,286
Is she all right?

1050
01:23:25,354 --> 01:23:27,788
- Yeah, she's fine.
- What are the charges? Drugs?

1051
01:23:27,856 --> 01:23:31,155
- No, no. There are no charges.
- Then what are they holding her for?

1052
01:23:32,394 --> 01:23:35,329
Just because they've had
a bit of a rough night.

1053
01:23:35,397 --> 01:23:38,992
A shooting, a burglary. The shit's
hit the fan tonight for some reason.

1054
01:23:42,237 --> 01:23:44,228
Hi, Andrea.

1055
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:55,012
Have you seen him?

1056
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:58,018
Yeah, man. We saw him down
by the dock just now.

1057
01:23:58,086 --> 01:24:01,021
Dock by the dock.
Without a doubt, yeah.

1058
01:24:41,963 --> 01:24:44,898
So you come to the Cayman Islands,
and you don't even call me?

1059
01:24:44,966 --> 01:24:47,025
I should be horsewhipped.

1060
01:24:48,637 --> 01:24:51,470
- Where's Allen?
- He left with them.

1061
01:25:01,249 --> 01:25:03,945
Courtesy of a grateful nation.

1062
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:08,452
For you and your family.

1063
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:14,250
- Thank you.
- There'll be a lot of questions asked.

1064
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:17,196
Where the money went.
Where it came from.

1065
01:25:17,265 --> 01:25:19,825
Who betrayed whose client.

1066
01:25:21,203 --> 01:25:23,569
Cayman police are gonna come
looking for you.

1067
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,034
God bless America.

1068
01:25:39,254 --> 01:25:41,688
Sweetheart?

1069
01:25:41,757 --> 01:25:44,726
- Are you okay?
- Daddy.

1070
01:25:44,793 --> 01:25:47,853
They treat you all right?

1071
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,799
Extradition time, Carl.
Vacation's over.

1072
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,599
What?

1073
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,774
Carl?

1074
01:26:01,977 --> 01:26:03,911
One minute.

1075
01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:05,913
Hold up.

1076
01:26:05,981 --> 01:26:08,916
I gotta go off
with these guys for a while.

1077
01:26:08,984 --> 01:26:11,748
- What happened?
- I fucked up, baby. I fucked up.

1078
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:15,984
I wish I could say something
that would make it all right, b-but I can't.

1079
01:26:16,057 --> 01:26:19,288
- What?
- You'll be okay. You'll see. It'll be okay.

1080
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:21,352
Baby, you're so beautiful.

1081
01:26:22,998 --> 01:26:25,057
You'll be okay. It's okay.

1082
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:28,660
Just look to your memories.
It's all you'll ever need.

1083
01:26:28,737 --> 01:26:31,672
- I love you so much. Do you know that?
- Gotta go.

1084
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:34,072
- Please. Please!
- Take him back.

1085
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:36,804
- Goddamn itl
- No. No. It's gonna be all right.

1086
01:26:38,513 --> 01:26:40,913
I want him in my car.

1087
01:26:40,982 --> 01:26:44,679
Can't just come to these islands
and exploit these people.

1088
01:26:44,753 --> 01:26:46,744
They don't deserve it.

1089
01:26:48,757 --> 01:26:50,691
Baby...

1090
01:26:50,759 --> 01:26:54,525
- Mr. Allen, why are you...
- Thanks for coming down. Keep the car.

1091
01:27:11,847 --> 01:27:13,838
Come on, sweetie.

1092
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:18,442
I'll look out for you.

1093
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:39,740
I've been looking for you all night.

1094
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:44,137
I lost my way...

1095
01:27:44,212 --> 01:27:46,043
and I'm sorry.

1096
01:27:47,048 --> 01:27:49,380
Baby, I really needed you.

1097
01:27:50,385 --> 01:27:52,319
It's just that...

1098
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:54,378
you're my heart.

1099
01:27:56,224 --> 01:27:58,215
And when you broke...

1100
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:00,727
I broke down with you.

1101
01:28:03,098 --> 01:28:05,896
I want to be with you, Shy.

1102
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:11,662
I don't care what my father thinks.

1103
01:28:12,874 --> 01:28:15,365
I don't care what Hammer thinks.

1104
01:28:19,514 --> 01:28:21,448
I care about you.

1105
01:28:21,516 --> 01:28:23,507
You don't know.

1106
01:28:25,053 --> 01:28:27,044
Know what?

1107
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,425
Fuck you, Shy. Huh?

1108
01:28:31,493 --> 01:28:36,396
I'd rather my sister be a whore
in the fucking streets than fuck with you!

1109
01:28:46,508 --> 01:28:49,170
Fuck it!

1110
01:28:53,048 --> 01:28:55,278
I'm sorry.

1111
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:11,565
- Patrick?
- You're on the clock.

1112
01:29:11,633 --> 01:29:13,123
Yeah. Patrick!

1113
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:15,669
Hey.

1114
01:29:16,338 --> 01:29:18,272
Listen to me.

1115
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:22,504
That piece of ass you call a secretary is at
the station right now making herself a deal.

1116
01:29:22,577 --> 01:29:26,172
So you have a choice... pack your shit
and meet us here in five minutes...

1117
01:29:26,247 --> 01:29:29,182
or your family's
gonna be visiting you in prison.

1118
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,014
It's all right.
I'm traveling light.

1119
01:29:34,222 --> 01:29:36,213
Yeah.
Twenty-eight pounds.

1120
01:29:37,859 --> 01:29:41,693
- What? Pardon?
- Don't you remember what you asked me, Allen?

1121
01:29:41,763 --> 01:29:44,095
In Miami?

1122
01:29:44,165 --> 01:29:47,134
You want to walk into a Realtor
with a million dollars in cash?

1123
01:29:47,202 --> 01:29:49,694
Do you have any idea how
much that would weigh?

1124
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:50,771
A million dollars.

1125
01:29:50,772 --> 01:29:52,706
One-hundred-dollar bills.

1126
01:29:52,774 --> 01:29:54,765
Twenty-eight pounds.

1127
01:29:56,544 --> 01:29:59,172
Chop chopl

1128
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:05,617
Where have you been?
Don't do that to me again, okay?

1129
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:07,848
Talk to me.
I've been so worried.

1130
01:30:07,922 --> 01:30:10,857
You ready? Come on!
We've got to go!

1131
01:30:13,194 --> 01:30:15,685
Fuck. Allen!

1132
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:28,032
Fuck!

1133
01:30:29,044 --> 01:30:31,035
Fuck!

1134
01:30:32,213 --> 01:30:34,204
Oh, no.

1135
01:30:35,216 --> 01:30:37,150
You...

1136
01:30:37,218 --> 01:30:39,152
fucking...

1137
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:41,154
fucking...

1138
01:30:41,222 --> 01:30:44,089
fucking, fucking, fucking...

1139
01:30:46,761 --> 01:30:48,353
Shit!

1140
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:55,067
Oh, fucking, fucking...

1141
01:30:55,136 --> 01:30:58,902
fucking, fucking, shitting...

1142
01:30:58,973 --> 01:31:01,066
fucking Christ!

1143
01:31:06,014 --> 01:31:08,005
We haven't got any money.

1144
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:11,775
This fucking place.

1145
01:31:13,588 --> 01:31:16,216
Fucking paradise.
It's about money like everything else.

1146
01:31:20,495 --> 01:31:22,429
Oh, let's go to the beach.

1147
01:31:22,497 --> 01:31:24,431
Let's smell the fucking ocean.

1148
01:31:24,499 --> 01:31:27,696
It's not about the beach.
It's not about the fucking ocean.

1149
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:31,569
It's about money,
and I haven't got any!

1150
01:31:39,214 --> 01:31:41,705
Found these at the front door.

1151
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:55,686
There's something
I gotta tell you about all this.

1152
01:31:57,065 --> 01:31:59,090
Save it for another time.

1153
01:34:08,496 --> 01:34:10,487
Don't cry.

1154
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:14,227
It's okay.

1155
01:34:14,302 --> 01:34:17,135
I'm sorry.
