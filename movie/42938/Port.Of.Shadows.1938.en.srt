1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:22,082


2
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,582
- going to Le Havre?
- Yeah. get in.

3
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,124
Thanks.

4
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,707
Tired?

5
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,124
Yes.

6
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,790
Are you on Ieave?

7
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,415
You're not very taIkative.

8
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,790
No, not very.

9
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,624
Cigarette?

10
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,874
Yes.

11
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,790
Thanks.

12
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,249
We're here.

13
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,749
- What?
- Le Havre.

14
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,832
Ah, yes. Le Havre.

15
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,124
This is some fog!

16
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,874
I know aII about fogs.
I was in Tonkin.

17
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,957
You must be joking.
It's not foggy in Tonkin.

18
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,207
Not foggy?

19
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,749
Yes, it is. In here.

20
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,540
Are you mad,
swerving to save a dog?

21
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,207
- A dog's a dog.
- And my bones are my bones.

22
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,124
got yeIIow fever?
Then take quinine.

23
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,249
You might be in the army
but I'm the boss in my truck.

24
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,207
Your truck, your bones!

25
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,082
If you don't Iike it, get out
and I'II rattIe those bones of yours.

26
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,249
AII right, I wiII.

27
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,207
Are we reaIIy going to fight
over a dog?

28
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,874
Don't think I'm chickening out.

29
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,082
I couId easiIy take a hoId of you
and head-butt you.

30
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,332
So much for your spanner!

31
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,832
I onIy grabbed it
in case you tried to shoot.

32
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,374
Shoot?

33
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,665
You don't know
what you're taIking about.

34
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,540
give me a cigarette.

35
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,999
Shooting might Iook easy.

36
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,207
Like shooting cIay pipes at the fair.

37
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,665
You shoot and then...

38
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,707
a man screams

39
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,957
and grabs hoId of his beIIy,
making a face Iike...

40
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,374
Like a kid who's eaten too much.

41
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,165
His hands turn red.

42
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,624
Then he faIIs.

43
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,749
And you're Ieft aII aIone,

44
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,707
not understanding a thing.

45
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,540
It's as if the ground
had faIIen away.

46
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,915
Right.

47
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,499
Anyway...

48
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,499
Thanks for the Iift. Here.

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,249
No hard feeIings?

50
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,957
Of course not.

51
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,124
- Bye.
- Want the packet?

52
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,415
- What about you?
- I've got more.

53
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,082
WeII, in that case...

54
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,165
- Thanks.
- Bye.

55
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,957
good Iuck.

56
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,624
It's a Iaugh a minute tonight.

57
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,665
- WiII he be Iong?
- I don't know.

58
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,249
You never know anything.

59
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,290
Coming to dance, Lucien?

60
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,665
I toId you to wait at the bar.
We're taIking.

61
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,749
I came here
because you asked me to

62
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,040
but I hate pIaces Iike this.

63
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,582
I find this music so dreadfuI.

64
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,124
I Iike cIassicaI music.

65
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,582
We know
what kind of music you Iike, ZabeI.

66
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,415
You know nothing.
You're just petty crooks.

67
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,915
That's right, make us Iaugh.
Act the fooI.

68
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,249
Funny, isn't he?

69
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,415
Sure, if you say so.

70
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,040
You even make the orphan Iaugh.

71
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,124
And he's not normaIIy cheerfuI.

72
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,874
You make us Iaugh.
It's a fact.

73
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,082
You can pretend to Iaugh

74
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,915
but you shouId be ashamed
of the Iife you Iead.

75
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,165
Your parents are respectabIe peopIe.

76
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,124
But you Iead the Iife of a gangster.
It's so demoraIising.

77
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:18,540
And to think
you Iearned to pIay the piano!

78
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,874
Listen, it's aII very weII
acting the fooI for five minutes,

79
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,374
but enough's enough.

80
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,624
Where's Maurice?

81
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,999
Yes, good oId Maurice!

82
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,832
No idea.

83
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,165
He used to drop in once in a whiIe.

84
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,040
But once I saw
he was a crook Iike you,

85
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,082
I asked him to space out his visits.

86
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,707
That's aII.

87
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,832
This music!

88
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,165
Maurice has disappeared

89
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,540
and since I've faIIen out with him...

90
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,749
- Over a woman, no doubt.
- That or something eIse.

91
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,915
Anyway, peopIe think I'm invoIved.

92
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,457
And deep down
that fIatters you, right?

93
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,832
But you're worried
it might cause you troubIe

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,415
so you'd Iike to know.

95
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,040
PreciseIy.

96
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,415
I'm sure you know a Iot.

97
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,957
Yes, a Iot!

98
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,665
You're wrong, my dears.
I don't know a thing.

99
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,040
And don't get so famiIiar.

100
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,415
I'm oId enough to be your father
and I'm an honest merchant.

101
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,624
We're pretty rare these days.

102
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,999
You invited me here
so I'II Iet you pay.

103
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,165
Madam, my hat and coat, pIease.

104
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,165
He makes fun of us
and then off he goes!

105
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,540
Let him go.

106
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,540
We'II go and see him Iater.

107
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,415
What for?

108
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,665
Just to see.

109
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,457
I toId you to get Iost!

110
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,749
Can't you be poIite?

111
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,790
I'm asking you
how much the rooms cost?

112
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,124
You're dressed up Iike an admiraI
so you can heIp the customers.

113
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,957
Just teII me what the rooms cost.

114
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,790
I'm teIIing you,
this is not a hoteI!

115
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,040
So you won't say
what the rooms cost?

116
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,124
It's not for tonight
because I'm skint.

117
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,082
But maybe tomorrow
or another night I couId...

118
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,374
get Iost or this couId turn nasty!

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,165
- Sorry.
- No harm done.

120
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,790
- What a brute!
- Who?

121
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,915
- The admiraI.
- Leave me in peace. I'm in a hurry.

122
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,457
But it's not every night
I meet a friend.

123
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,999
I don't Iove soIdiers.
I just feeI sorry for them.

124
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,332
I might have been a soIdier

125
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,332
if I hadn't come a cropper
the day I got caIIed up.

126
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,540
- Are you going to Ieave me aIone?
- Are you a brute too?

127
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,915
No, I just want to be Ieft aIone.

128
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,957
Now I see. I get it.

129
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,832
Do you have to be so cIingy?

130
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,957
- Is that your dog?
- No.

131
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,999
If you're Iooking for a quiet spot,
I might be abIe to heIp you.

132
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,540
The troubIe is, I'm skint.

133
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,665
That doesn't matter.
I'II take you to Panama's.

134
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,082
- What's Panama's?
- Panama's?

135
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,165
It's the quietest spot on the coast.

136
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,749
For a seaside resort,
it's the best you can find.

137
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,165
Four waIIs, a door and a roof on top.

138
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,415
My dream is...

139
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,665
If you dream standing up,
you'II faII over.

140
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,499
Never mind.

141
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,832
Here we are.
It's that pIace Iit up over there.

142
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:10,832
My dream is to sIeep just once
between cIean, white sheets.

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,082
A top sheet and a bottom sheet.

144
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,665
Your dog's back.

145
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,540
I toId you, he's not mine.

146
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,082
get Iost, wiII you?

147
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,082
I've got no dog, nothing.

148
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,582
Don't you Iike dogs?

149
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,790
Not one that's Iooking for a master.

150
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,624
Have you found a master?

151
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,540
Not yet.

152
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,540
- Who is it?
- HaIf Pint.

153
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,707
Open up. I'm not aIone.

154
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,540
Come in.

155
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,415
good evening.

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,457
Want a drink?

157
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,915
I'm not thirsty.
I just need some rest.

158
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,915
Besides, I can't afford a drink.

159
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,415
That doesn't matter.
Make yourseIf at home.

160
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,874
But I'm warning you,

161
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,457
don't try teIIing me
some sob story about the fog,

162
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,790
your troubIes and your probIems.

163
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,249
There's no fog here,
onIy fair weather.

164
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,499
The hands are naiIed down, so...

165
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,457
any personaI stuff...

166
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,999
CaIm down.
I'm not the taIkative type.

167
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,915
WeII, I am, but I'm discreet.

168
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,332
What do you think of this one?

169
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,082
It's a reaI one.

170
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,040
I bought it in Panama, in 1906.

171
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,582
Panama!

172
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,457
It cuts America in haIf.

173
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,374
You cross it by boat

174
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,790
and you're down beIow
Iooking up at monkeys in the sky.

175
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,832
BIue monkeys.

176
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,415
It's wonderfuI.

177
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,832
- Tired?
- A IittIe.

178
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,165
Forgive me.

179
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,832
Tired or not,
it's none of my business.

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,290
UsuaIIy, I never ask questions.

181
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,207
No harm done.

182
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,707
Leave that aIone, you idiot!

183
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,790
The crew wiII come ungIued.

184
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,582
You've aIready swaIIowed
the cabin boy.

185
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,249
Panama, 1906.

186
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,457
32 years in the bottIe

187
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,999
and you want to guIp it down!

188
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,582
When I'm thirsty...

189
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,124
HeII, aII I want is...

190
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,207
I know. To sIeep in cIean sheets.

191
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,749
- Hi, Panama.
- MicheI.

192
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,582
You've got a crowd in tonight.

193
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,124
Yeah, high society!

194
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,874
PeopIe are what they are.

195
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,499
Pretty awfuI, pretty criminaI.

196
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,457
But there are pretty things too.

197
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,957
You shouId paint them.

198
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,582
Paint them?

199
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,040
I've tried painting
fIowers, young women, chiIdren...

200
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,582
It was Iike painting crime
with aII that entaiIs.

201
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,332
I'd see crime in a rose.

202
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,874
It's caIIed painting with a knife!

203
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,707
What couId be simpIer than a tree?

204
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,415
And yet when I paint one,
I make everyone iII at ease.

205
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:54,207
There's aIways something
or someone hidden behind the tree.

206
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,915
I paint things
hidden behind other things.

207
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,249
To me, a swimmer
is aIready a drowned man.

208
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,207
Whenever I try to paint gaiety,
music,

209
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,832
a dance or an outdoor wedding,

210
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,832
on my canvas
I find onIy hatred, jeaIousy,

211
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,665
murder and cemeteries.

212
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,332
StiII Iives!

213
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,374
Be quiet, you idiot!

214
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,624
No, I'm the idiot.

215
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:31,040
OnIy an idiot can Iive this way
with such anguish.

216
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,290
Don't you think so?

217
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,249
I think you're compIicated.

218
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,040
Yes.

219
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,582
But...

220
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,665
Things wiII work out.

221
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,915
I've come fuII circIe.

222
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,332
Are you stiII considering suicide?

223
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,290
Some peopIe go fishing
some go hunting,

224
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,249
some go to war.

225
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,540
Others commit crimes of passion.

226
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,790
And some commit suicide.
You have to kiII someone.

227
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,082
That's Iife for you!

228
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,082
Take your drinking, for instance,
you drink to kiII the pain.

229
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,207
Me?

230
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,374
I drink to get drunk.

231
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,332
It amounts to the same thing.

232
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,874
As for you, I'm sure

233
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,540
that if I did your portrait...

234
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,124
Leave me aIone!

235
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,665
Your hands in your pockets,
at night in the fog...

236
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,707
I've had enough of this!

237
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,207
You and your fancy taIk!

238
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,165
It's getting on my nerves.

239
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,707
- Have you been drinking too?
- Shut up. What do you know?

240
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,207
I get upset and you insist
that I've been drinking.

241
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,874
I haven't.
I just haven't eaten for two days.

242
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,749
There's a sign on my beIIy
that says "coId storage".

243
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,832
Didn't they feed you in the army?

244
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,290
What's it to you?

245
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,499
You shouId have said
you were hungry.

246
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,040
It's not hard.

247
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,915
I know. When you're hungry
you ask for food.

248
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,707
OnIy I shut up out of pride.

249
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,290
I'm proud. Funny, that.

250
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,749
PeopIe say I'm headstrong.

251
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,415
They're right. I am headstrong.

252
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,832
And you're hard-headed too!

253
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,124
You said you were hungry.

254
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,457
- I am.
- Come on, then.

255
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,832
There's bread, sausage
and some Chester cheese.

256
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,207
In Panama I aIways bought Chester.

257
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:59,040
If you haven't eaten for a whiIe,
you shouId eat sIowIy.

258
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,582
Aren't you going to teII me
to enjoy my food?

259
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,165
Have you forgotten your manners?

260
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:25,082
You again!
Perhaps you're hungry too.

261
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,124
- Is he yours?
- Yes.

262
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,999
He's got a nice face.

263
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,582
So have you.

264
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,415
You're pretty and I Iike you.

265
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,249
I mean it.

266
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,374
You're skinny but I Iike you.

267
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,415
It's Iike in the movies,
I see you and I Iike you.

268
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,082
It's Iove at first sight.

269
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,415
I'm Iove-struck.

270
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,665
You know that IittIe chap
with wings on his back and arrows?

271
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,040
Hearts on trees.

272
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,332
Romance that ends in tears.

273
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,082
You girIs!

274
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,415
You're aII the same.
You pIay dirty tricks on us.

275
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,999
Do you reaIIy think that?

276
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,124
What?

277
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,915
What you say about Iove.

278
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,040
You girIs are aII the same.

279
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,665
You tout your wares,
but reaIIy you're after romance.

280
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,499
What did you say?
We tout our wares?

281
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,040
Yes. Have you never heard
the expression before?

282
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,957
You tout your wares, you hustIe.

283
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,165
Why do you taIk to me Iike that?

284
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,082
Come off it!

285
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,040
Don't teII me you came here
to bring your granny a cake,

286
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,665
Iike LittIe Red Riding Hood.

287
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,249
Pity, because...

288
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,207
I'm the big bad woIf.

289
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,957
And the big bad woIf
is not very cIever.

290
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,124
Do you think khaki suits me?

291
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,915
TeII me...

292
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,999
Why do you keep Iaughing Iike that?

293
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,124
It's not a reaI Iaugh. It's sad.

294
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,832
Have you ever seen a woman
faII in Iove with a soIdier?

295
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,582
Women Iove a soIdier
when he's on parade.

296
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,665
But when a uniformed soIdier
shows up on his own,

297
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,832
you shouId see the Iook
on their faces then.

298
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:35,082
I don't even know
why I'm teIIing you this.

299
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,290
Men and women can't get aIong.

300
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,874
They don't speak the same Ianguage.

301
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,665
They don't use the same vocabuIary.

302
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,040
Maybe so,
but they can stiII Iove one another.

303
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,874
Have you ever Ioved anyone?

304
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,624
- Not reaIIy.
- WeII, then?

305
00:22:58,583 --> 00:22:59,915
What's that?

306
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,290
I don't know.

307
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,665
- What was that?
- Just some bad boys.

308
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,499
I picked a quiet spot
to get away from them

309
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,790
and they come here
to kiII one another.

310
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:23,124
Your Iighting is Iike the catacombs.

311
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,207
- WeII?
- WeII!

312
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,915
Most unfortunate.

313
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,082
How couId you Iose him?

314
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,540
He'II be hiding in that shack.

315
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,207
- What shack?
- The bar over there.

316
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,874
That dump?

317
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,374
get in!

318
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,332
I'm sure he's here.

319
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,707
Then Iet's go and get him.

320
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,165
Open up.
We're dying of thirst.

321
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,332
We're cIosed.

322
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:13,249
If you don't open up,
we'II come in anyway.

323
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,124
- ShaII we bash the door in?
- First warning shot.

324
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,165
Fired in the air, Iike in Panama.

325
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,832
The next one's for you.

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,707
They're going to shoot.

327
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,790
Are you afraid of the gunfire?

328
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,957
- I wish that was aII.
- What eIse is there?

329
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,540
I can't teII you.

330
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,624
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

331
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,165
You're sweet.

332
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,249
What's your name?

333
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,499
NeIIy.

334
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,207
I'm Jean.

335
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,499
The bastards!

336
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,540
A reaI navaI battIe!

337
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,207
WonderfuI!

338
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,207
The captain's aII aIone on board.

339
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,832
I think they got the message.

340
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,165
What a IoveIy night!

341
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,624
Indeed.

342
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,374
Hey!

343
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,082
This Iooks Iike bIood.

344
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,040
BIood?

345
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,874
What are you doing there?

346
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,207
Are you wounded?

347
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:14,915
I must have cut my hand when I feII.

348
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,665
May I come in?

349
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,707
Come in.

350
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,290
Life is a curious thing,

351
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,790
at Ieast what you see of it
between midnight and 3am.

352
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,915
That man mustn't see me here.

353
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:38,707
I don't want
too many peopIe to see me either.

354
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,915
They were after me
Iike a pack of woIves.

355
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,707
I got away but it was a cIose caII.

356
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:48,290
- give me some rum, boss.
- There's no rum here.

357
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,915
But you can wash your hands.

358
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,582
Ah, yes, my hands.

359
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:58,415
BIood stains cIothes
but it washes off hands easiIy.

360
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:03,415
Have you ever noticed
how doctors, surgeons in particuIar,

361
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,915
have white, weII-kept hands?

362
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,957
Yet they paddIe in bIood
aII day Iong.

363
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:14,290
I'm not a doctor.
I seII cut-price trinkets.

364
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,082
Nobody asked you what you did.

365
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,624
There's some rainwater
outside in the bucket.

366
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,540
As you wish.

367
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,957
Are you an artist?

368
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:35,207
I wish I was. I Iove the arts.

369
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:39,374
CIassicaI music,
especiaIIy reIigious music.

370
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,749
It brings back memories.

371
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,165
I Iove sifting through my memories.

372
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:48,332
FamiIy memories,
chiIdhood memories.

373
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,457
Where's your wound?
I can't see it.

374
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,249
I must have been mistaken.

375
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,165
And now I've Iost my parceI.

376
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,832
My parceI. That is upsetting.

377
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,040
So that wasn't your bIood?

378
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:20,499
I don't know who you are.
It's none of my business.

379
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,749
It's dawn. You can go now.

380
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,624
You've got a face I don't Iike.

381
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,874
Some faces are IikeabIe,
some aren't.

382
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:34,374
It's unimportant.
A face doesn't amount to much.

383
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,332
It carries so IittIe weight.

384
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,957
Mine pIeases nobody,
but beIieve it or not,

385
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,749
when I Iook in a mirror, I Iike it.

386
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,040
Better to have this face
than none at aII, right?

387
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,957
Each time the sun rises,
we think something new wiII happen,

388
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,540
something fresh.

389
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,457
Then the sun goes to bed

390
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,207
and so do we.

391
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,790
It's sad.

392
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,415
Did you mean what you said earIier?

393
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,374
What?

394
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,249
About Iove.

395
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,874
I wouIdn't have said it otherwise.

396
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,915
You might have said it
to soften up a customer.

397
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,790
A customer?

398
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,082
Sorry to disturb you.

399
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,332
Nothing Iike a coId shower
to perk a feIIow up.

400
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:17,915
Now I'm fresh as a daisy
and ready for work.

401
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,374
You work?

402
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,374
Yes, down at the docks.

403
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,457
This hoIds two Iitres.

404
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,665
Each morning I swipe two Iitres
to seII at night.

405
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,624
It's iIIegaI, of course,

406
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:33,290
but I'm the onIy one
who recorks the barreI.

407
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,374
It's a simpIe question
of professionaI honesty.

408
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:37,749
Bye, then.

409
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,249
Excuse me, IoveIy Iady,

410
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,040
but work is work.

411
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,290
Staying here?

412
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,832
No.

413
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,999
Where are you going?

414
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,749
- I don't know.
- We're going the same way, then.

415
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,790
Do you Iike Iife?

416
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,124
- What?
- You Iike Iife, don't you?

417
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,290
Yes, on certain days.

418
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:15,207
Does Iife Iike you?

419
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,707
So far it's been pretty mean, but...

420
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,749
that may change since I Iike it.

421
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,707
Thanks for your hospitaIity.
You've been great.

422
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,374
Thank you for keeping me company.

423
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,790
If I can heIp in any way...

424
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,374
HeIp me?

425
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,332
Perhaps you couId find me
some civvies.

426
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,124
I see. So you're on permanent Ieave?

427
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:53,165
- I thought you didn't ask questions.
- Don't you trust me?

428
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:57,165
- Yes, but...
- This is my onIy suit and I Iike it.

429
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,374
Come back tonight
and I might have something.

430
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,915
Thanks. I wiII.

431
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,915
What's your shoe size?

432
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,124
- Seven and a haIf. Why?
- No reason.

433
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,207
Coming?

434
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,207
Sometimes Iuck strikes.

435
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,249
Luck?

436
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,582
He's a seven and a haIf, Iike me.

437
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,957
He needs cIothes, I have some.

438
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,290
He wants a new Iife, but...

439
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,040
he needs a pass.

440
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,124
Yes, he needs a new identity.

441
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,665
That's obvious.

442
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,749
He's in Iuck.
I have one going spare.

443
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,249
- Oh?
- My own.

444
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,415
If he can use it...

445
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,207
I'm going swimming.

446
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,290
The sea's rough and it's foggy.

447
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,624
What?

448
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:41,582
I'm just stating the facts.
The sea is rough and it's foggy.

449
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,457
And that's fine by me.

450
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,332
I swim pretty badIy.

451
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,499
Even so, I'm going to swim out
as far as possibIe.

452
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,832
What do you want me to say?

453
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:59,249
- Nothing.
- OK.

454
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,749
MicheI!

455
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,874
Don't do anything stupid.

456
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,665
What good wiII it do?

457
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,582
What a fog!

458
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,582
What awfuI weather!

459
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,207
Shoes.

460
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,040
BottIe tops, an oId comb.

461
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,957
The seabed's vast.

462
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,665
That's not the seabed.

463
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,290
The seabed's further out and deeper.

464
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,915
You taIk Iike a deep-sea diver.

465
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,374
- How oId are you?
- 17.

466
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,040
Me too...

467
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,915
I was 17 once.

468
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,790
- That's funny.
- What?

469
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,249
- Look at NeIIy.
- Where?

470
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,540
There, with a soIdier.

471
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,040
Curious.

472
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:47,749
- I thought we were going for coffee?
- We're going to have some fun.

473
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,249
I'm going to Panama's tonight.
Come aIong.

474
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,165
I wiII if I can.

475
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,957
got any money?

476
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,540
- Why? Do you want some?
- You don't have any.

477
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,415
Yesterday you were hungry.

478
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,374
Why do you ask, then?

479
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,582
Hi.

480
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,665
Come here a minute.

481
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,249
What do you want?

482
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,707
Nothing. We were just passing.

483
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,624
I came over to say heIIo.

484
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:44,207
And to ask for news of Maurice.

485
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,874
- You must know something.
- I know nothing. Leave me aIone.

486
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,374
I see you've aIready forgotten
Maurice and found a repIacement?

487
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,457
great.

488
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,790
You'II go out with anybody
but you turn me down.

489
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,665
Why?

490
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,582
I think you're pretty.

491
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:09,124
You've got a pretty mouth.

492
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,332
- I Iike it.
- Don't touch me!

493
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,624
You don't want to be touched?

494
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,082
Did Maurice never touch you?

495
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,457
What about the others?
What about him?

496
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,082
Everybody except me!

497
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,957
Leave me aIone.

498
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:30,290
Instead of hanging out
at the Petit Tabarin,

499
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,499
you shouId stay in the shop
with your guardian.

500
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,999
By the way,
when you see ZabeI,

501
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,915
teII him from me
that Iast night's fun

502
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,165
was just a warning.

503
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,957
That business disgusts me.

504
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,124
Do I disgust you too?

505
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,082
You too. You especiaIIy.

506
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,415
- Me especiaIIy, eh?
- Leave me aIone.

507
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,415
I said, Ieave me aIone!

508
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,082
Leave her aIone
Iike she asked you to.

509
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:08,165
Take my advice,
go and toss some stones in the water.

510
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:12,207
You soIdiers are easiIy pIeased.

511
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,665
You spit in the water
and you're happy as Larry.

512
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,249
You can stiII Ieave her aIone.

513
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:20,207
He's the caIm type.

514
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,040
A master of seIf-controI.

515
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,749
There are three of us
and you're on your own.

516
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,624
Three? Can't you count?

517
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,790
You must be counting on the big man

518
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,415
because you two
don't amount to much.

519
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,040
- Whatever. Come with me.
- Leave her aIone!

520
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,499
A simpIe soIdier dishing out orders?

521
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,082
get Iost, wiII you?

522
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,374
Sorry, I'm a bit rough.

523
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,332
It was just a joke.

524
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:55,082
Leaving, are you? In a hurry now?

525
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,249
Stay away from me. Don't hit me.

526
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,832
Don't hit me. I'm warning you...

527
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,124
Watch it!

528
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,874
Watch what?

529
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,540
Lost your nerve aII of a sudden,
have you?

530
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:12,290
You've turned paIe.
You don't Iook too good.

531
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,082
Next time you see me coming,
I suggest you cross the street.

532
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,082
Otherwise you'II have this
coming to you.

533
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,999
Come on!

534
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,915
Are you getting in or not?

535
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,624
Lucien Iooks Iike he's going to cry.

536
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:37,540
So much for having fun!

537
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,749
Why did you do that?
You don't know if I'm worth it.

538
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:04,457
I thought you were in a hurry.

539
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,124
I don't know. I ran away.

540
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,957
If I go back, it wiII be awfuI.
If I don't, it wiII be the same.

541
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,040
I shouId go back too.

542
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:19,707
But if I did,
Iike you say, it wouId be awfuI.

543
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,165
goodbye, Jean.

544
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,624
I'II come to Panama's tonight
if I can.

545
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:28,874
goodbye.

546
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,207
NeIIy?

547
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:11,499
It's me.

548
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,874
Listen. It's beautifuI.

549
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,124
Shut up!

550
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:23,165
You make fun
of aII that is fine and beautifuI.

551
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,040
You've Iaughed at us enough.
It's over.

552
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,457
Are you drunk or on drugs?

553
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:33,040
I'm sick of being humiIiated.
I'm a man. Do you hear me?

554
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:35,374
I'm a man and I'II prove it.

555
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:36,374
Right now!

556
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:38,499
Put that away. We came here to taIk.

557
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,665
ReckIess youth!

558
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,874
give me the papers, aII of them.

559
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:49,040
TeII us where Maurice is.

560
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,915
I bet you've bumped him off.

561
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,290
What a thing to say.

562
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:57,374
What were you doing down
by the water with those parceIs?

563
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,665
- Answer me, or eIse...
- Or eIse what?

564
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:06,082
I'II show you who I am.
I'II prove to you that I'm somebody.

565
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,582
I know who you are.

566
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,165
You're Lucien Lagardier,
from a fine famiIy but iII-bred.

567
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:15,082
Too much pocket money
and yet never enough.

568
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,082
You struck some deaIs
and got into troubIe

569
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,665
so you came to oId ZabeI
to ask him to baiI you out.

570
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:25,874
You're an ungratefuI boy.
I've heIped you out before.

571
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:28,790
Last night you tried to run me over

572
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,749
and shoot me.

573
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,499
I don't know where Maurice is.

574
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:38,290
But the papers concerning you
are in safe keeping.

575
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:49,415
Were it god's wiII
for me to die a vioIent death,

576
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:52,915
you wouId aII be in big troubIe.

577
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:59,290
You came here to scare me
and you haven't succeeded.

578
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,165
It's true.
They came here to scare me.

579
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,415
To scare me!

580
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,332
You IittIe worms!

581
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,665
Don't you reaIise
I can't even scare myseIf?

582
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,624
Shut him up!

583
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,249
Shut him up or I'II kiII him.

584
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,832
I'II shoot you, I swear it.

585
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,082
What good wouId that do?

586
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,457
- Let me go.
- Come on.

587
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,415
go out the back way.

588
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,374
- One day I'II prove I'm somebody.
- What's got into him?

589
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:34,332
A soIdier taught him a Iesson
earIier. It was about NeIIy.

590
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,457
- ReaIIy?
- Lucien tried to taIk to her.

591
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:40,540
The soIdier punched Babe
and sIapped Lucien.

592
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,999
What did Lucien do?

593
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:44,665
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

594
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:47,665
These soIdiers are admirabIe.

595
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,332
Why are you teIIing me this?
Lucien is your friend.

596
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:52,207
Friends come and go.

597
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:58,207
- Expecting someone for Iunch?
- Yes, my goddaughter.

598
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,040
Think she'II come back?

599
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:02,790
She aIways comes back.

600
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,624
Here she is now. go.

601
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,249
goodbye.

602
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:19,415
You fIy off Iike a swaIIow.

603
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,249
You desert your oId guardian.

604
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,707
You Ieave him aII aIone,
worried sick.

605
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,749
Why did you run off the other night?

606
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:28,957
I was scared.

607
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,457
You're such a baby.
Why come back, then?

608
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:34,957
The others scare me too.
Where eIse can I go?

609
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:41,707
Don't you Iike it here?
Aren't I good to you?

610
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:50,582
You're stiII a IittIe girI
and yet you're a IittIe Iady too.

611
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,207
Don't Iook at me Iike that!

612
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,624
Where were you Iast night?

613
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:58,582
Nowhere. I went for a waIk.

614
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,874
And found a regiment.
SoIdiers are handsome, aren't they?

615
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,874
Is it saiIing soon?

616
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,540
- Tomorrow.
- Where to?

617
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,749
VenezueIa, I think.

618
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:42,790
VenezueIa?

619
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,790
Want something?

620
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,832
No, just Iooking.

621
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:14,832
Stay there. You must be tired.

622
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,374
Can I heIp you?

623
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:26,624
I'd Iike the IittIe box
in the window.

624
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:29,415
I'd Iike "Jean and NeIIy"
engraved on it.

625
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:31,165
And today's date.

626
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:35,707
Jean and NeIIy? That's nice.

627
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:40,790
It's good to be sentimentaI. PeopIe
are so hard-hearted these days.

628
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,165
NeIIy?

629
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,165
This man has a gift for you.

630
00:48:56,583 --> 00:49:00,457
I'II make you a gift
of your gift to NeIIy.

631
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,915
Any friend of my goddaughter's
is a friend of mine.

632
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,832
Do you Iike animaIs?

633
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:12,790
They don't Iike me much.

634
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:19,499
- May I heIp you?
- We'd Iike some postcards.

635
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:28,332
Did you foIIow me here?

636
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,499
No. I Iooked in the window
and came in.

637
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,790
Why did you want
to buy me a souvenir?

638
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,915
To get rid of some spare cash.
I don't accept money from women.

639
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,457
Men, women,
what difference does it make?

640
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:47,332
Sorry. Business is business.

641
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,290
I hope you'II have coffee with us.

642
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,832
- No, thanks. I have to...
- PIease.

643
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,207
Such poIiteness in a soIdier
is unheard of.

644
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,790
Come aIong.

645
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,249
I suppose you're on Ieave.

646
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:07,249
You're not from round here.
I bet you're from Paris.

647
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,624
- Yes.
- That's obvious.

648
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,540
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

649
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:14,332
Everyone's weIcome here.

650
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,832
Are you here to see famiIy?

651
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,832
NeIIy, fetch a bottIe of cognac
from the ceIIar.

652
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,832
She's a nice girI, isn't she?

653
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,499
She runs away from time to time,
but it's nothing serious.

654
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,415
Her mother was Iike that too.

655
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:50,207
Short escapades but nothing serious.

656
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,624
Then one day she Ieft
and never came back.

657
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,957
The girI stayed with her father.

658
00:50:56,125 --> 00:51:00,040
He was a fine man but he died.

659
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,415
More coffee?

660
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:25,332
It's better than your average cup.

661
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,790
Do you Iike the army?

662
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,290
I get to traveI.

663
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:49,165
- Have you been in Le Havre Iong?
- Since yesterday.

664
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:51,124
Pretty town, isn't it?

665
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:54,499
NeIIy, what is it?

666
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,874
NeIIy!

667
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,624
Don't touch me.
Leave me aIone!

668
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,249
I need to taIk to you.

669
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:17,415
What do you want from him?

670
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,040
You have a fever.
Come and Iie down.

671
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,207
I'II take you to your room.

672
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:46,332
She's so sensitive.
The sIightest thing upsets her.

673
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,749
You were at Panama's Iast night.

674
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,415
What of it?

675
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,874
I didn't see you
but I saw your dog.

676
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,582
He growIed at me.

677
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,790
NeIIy was there too, wasn't she?

678
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:05,624
I don't answer questions
I don't Iike.

679
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:10,624
No one who spends the night there
has a cIear conscience.

680
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,124
ReaIIy?

681
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,499
That goes for me as weII as you.

682
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:19,249
Do you have a good memory
for numbers?

683
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:22,457
I do. Take this number, for exampIe.

684
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,332
36-14.

685
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,415
I onIy saw it once but I remember it.

686
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,040
What?

687
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:33,165
It's your army seriaI number.
I saw it on your shirt earIier.

688
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,665
So?

689
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,832
So what?

690
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,582
So this.

691
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:42,582
I'm very discreet
about peopIe who do me a favour.

692
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,790
And peopIe who don't?

693
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,207
That depends.

694
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,665
You did me a favour
without knowing it.

695
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,415
By sIapping Lucien Lagardier.

696
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,999
- Who?
- This morning down by the docks.

697
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:03,165
I'm weII informed.
What I don't see, I guess.

698
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:09,290
You didn't come to Le Havre
by chance.

699
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,540
That's none of your business.

700
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,790
Perhaps, but I'm interested.

701
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,540
You came here because of the ships.

702
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:21,665
You're in troubIe and you want
to Ieave in search of a new Iife.

703
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,415
I can heIp you Ieave.

704
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,290
I don't want anything.

705
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:28,624
I have money if you want.

706
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,499
I can get you ID, a passport.

707
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:39,249
Lucien Lagardier is
an immoraI good-for-nothing.

708
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,915
He's threatening me
and he'II stop at nothing.

709
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,290
So?

710
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,124
I do you a favour, you do me one.
Everyone's happy.

711
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,999
At night Lucien goes down
by the water.

712
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,915
You're there.
You push him. He faIIs in.

713
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:02,790
ChiId's pIay!

714
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:08,457
Whenever a rogue disappears,
society breathes a IittIe easier.

715
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,040
Think it over.

716
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,332
Is that right?

717
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,999
I've thought it over.

718
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:18,499
Listen...

719
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:21,082
In Tonkin I once saw a Iimp,
gooey bug.

720
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,832
Just seeing it wiggIe
made me want to puke.

721
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,790
It was a scoIopendra.

722
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:29,082
You remind me of it,
with your sIimy voice.

723
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,915
You sound
as if you're wading through sIime.

724
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,874
My voice is odd but so are you.

725
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,582
I am the way I am.

726
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,290
I've onIy ever stepped out of Iine
when I've been angry.

727
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:43,915
Whenever anything good happens,
scum Iike you come and mess it up.

728
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:50,665
You disgust me
but I don't Iike squashing bugs.

729
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,582
Come on.

730
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,665
Jean!

731
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,249
I was watching.
Jean, be carefuI.

732
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,832
- Of your guardian?
- Yes.

733
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,999
I can see why you want
to get out of that pIace.

734
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,749
Can I see you tonight?

735
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:24,874
- Where?
- Anywhere. The fair on the dock.

736
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,290
- Fairs are big pIaces.
- This is a smaII one.

737
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:31,624
I'II meet you at the carouseI
with the white rabbits.

738
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,582
- What time?
- Nine.

739
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,499
This is some pair of shoes!

740
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:51,415
So that's why he asked my size.

741
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:55,457
And I yeIIed at the poor man.

742
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:58,749
It's a shame he Ieft
before I couId thank him.

743
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,582
Do you know where he went?

744
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:05,374
PeopIe come and go.

745
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:08,915
We're aII just passing through.

746
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:11,874
AII the same, I feeI Iucky.

747
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,665
I'm not normaIIy so Iucky
but today...

748
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,290
I'm a Iucky deviI.

749
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:23,540
Funny how Iight a hat can feeI
when you're not used to it.

750
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,040
It's so Iight.

751
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,790
The trousers are a bit tight but...

752
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:31,332
They have side tabs.
I can adjust them.

753
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,082
Nice cIoth.

754
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,582
He must be rich to give these away.

755
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,624
No doubt. He Ieft this for you too.

756
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,540
Money?

757
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,832
850 francs.

758
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,999
- 850?
- And that's not aII. A passport.

759
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,082
- What for?
- He thought you might need it.

760
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,457
He thought...

761
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,582
I didn't ask for anything.

762
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,790
How did he guess?

763
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,790
guess what?

764
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:02,374
That I wanted to Ieave.
What about him?

765
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:06,040
He won't be needing it.

766
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,082
- ReaIIy?
- He's not bothered.

767
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,832
So if it wiII heIp you...

768
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:12,624
MicheI Kraus.

769
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,749
Height: 5'8.

770
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:18,249
Medium-sized nose, brown hair.

771
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:22,290
Funny how aII men Iook aIike
on paper.

772
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,915
- You'II have to change the picture.
- That's easiIy done.

773
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:28,124
And fix the stamp and the signature.

774
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:30,249
That's easy too. Here...

775
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:36,249
If no one has come for this
in a year and a day, it's yours.

776
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:43,165
Thanks.
I'm no good with words, so...

777
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:45,999
Come on.

778
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,124
Don't forget your paint box.

779
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:54,249
Your name's MicheI Kraus
and you're an artist.

780
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,374
Yes.

781
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,582
That's right.

782
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,415
- goodbye.
- goodbye.

783
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:10,249
- When do you saiI?
- Tomorrow at five.

784
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,207
- For VenezueIa?
- Yes.

785
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,374
Pretty, isn't it?

786
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:37,249
The ships, the sea, the saiIors...

787
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,457
Everything's pretty to an artist.

788
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:42,874
I've been watching you.

789
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:46,415
It's easy to spot a painter's eye.

790
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:50,124
I was aImost a painter myseIf.

791
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:51,999
I had paint in my bIood.

792
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:55,957
Then I did a medicaI degree.
Utter madness.

793
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:59,582
You're Iooking
at the doctor in spite of himseIf!

794
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:04,290
Dr MoIIet,
doctor on board the Louisiana.

795
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,582
MicheI Kraus.

796
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,499
- WiII you have a drink with me?
- I'm in a hurry.

797
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,457
I have a Iot to do too.

798
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:16,582
I saiI tomorrow
but I stiII have time for a drink.

799
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,207
- You saiI tomorrow?
- For VenezueIa.

800
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:24,040
Come aIong if you Iike.
She's a good ship.

801
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:25,832
You'd be comfortabIe.

802
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,582
For a painter
traveI is a source of renewaI.

803
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,874
- Do you take passengers?
- SeriousIy?

804
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,624
You'd reaIIy Iike to come?

805
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,415
Why not?

806
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,374
There's nothing keeping me here.

807
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,249
As Iong as it's not too expensive.

808
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,415
I know you artists aren't weaIthy.

809
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:47,749
Come on.

810
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:51,249
Big decisions are best made
over a gIass of something.

811
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,040
Hi!

812
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:11,957
You Iook happy. good day?

813
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,915
You bet! Two Iitres of the best.

814
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:18,374
- Where are you off to?
- Bed.

815
01:02:36,041 --> 01:02:37,915
- HeIIo.
- What's it to be?

816
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,874
- A room.
- A room? Right away.

817
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,582
- What about my rum?
- Coming right up.

818
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:46,040
- Want something?
- No.

819
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:48,582
Yes, give me a shot.

820
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,165
- Of what?
- A smaII shot of rum.

821
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,624
In a big gIass!

822
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,415
It's just a formaIity.
You artists are aII bohemians.

823
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:05,665
My papers are in order.
My passport...

824
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:09,082
Perfect. I'II arrange everything
with the captain.

825
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:12,707
You can teII me
if you Iike my watercoIours.

826
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:15,332
WatercoIours?

827
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,040
Are you a Iandscape painter?

828
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,290
I don't go in for theories.

829
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,582
You're not a cubist?

830
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,040
A cubist? No.

831
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,249
Just as weII,
because I find cubism...

832
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:29,207
What do you paint?

833
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,415
In generaI...

834
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:39,082
I paint things
that are hidden behind things.

835
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,915
Very interesting.

836
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:45,290
For exampIe, if I see a swimmer,

837
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,665
I think he's going to drown.

838
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,749
So I paint a drowning man.

839
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,374
Your painting doesn't sound
very cheerfuI.

840
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,540
As Iong as it's weII painted.

841
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:00,707
Never mind the subject matter.

842
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:02,457
good heaIth!

843
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:11,332
Boss, another shot
to keep these company.

844
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:15,207
Are you going to take that room
or not?

845
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:18,332
Ah, yes, the room.

846
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,124
- How much is it?
- 18 francs.

847
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:24,415
And what do I owe you?

848
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:25,999
18 francs.

849
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:28,540
I'II pay up, then.

850
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,999
- What about the room?
- The room?

851
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,957
Too Iate. good night.

852
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:41,874
And be on time.

853
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:43,999
Ships don't wait for you.

854
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:45,874
Do you have much Iuggage?

855
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:48,040
Very IittIe, just one suitcase.

856
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:49,790
- One suitcase?
- Yes.

857
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:53,249
You're Ieaving for VenezueIa
with one suitcase?

858
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:55,749
How wonderfuI!

859
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:57,790
Just as I imagine an artist to be.

860
01:04:57,958 --> 01:05:00,790
No baggage, independence, freedom.

861
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:03,207
It's good to be free.

862
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:06,332
Yes, it is.

863
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,999
I'm sure you pIan to return.

864
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,582
I mean...

865
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,415
Aren't you invoIved with anyone?

866
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,957
No.

867
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,290
No one.

868
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,957
Don't move.

869
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,749
One...two...three.

870
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,457
Thank you.

871
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,040
The journey's over so soon.

872
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:47,040
It wouId be wonderfuI
if we couId saiI away, the two of us.

873
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,582
The two of us...

874
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,082
That reminds me. Wait here.
I need another picture.

875
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,582
- Another one?
- Yes, I need another one.

876
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,999
To send to a girI?

877
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:58,207
- No.
- ReaIIy?

878
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,832
I said no, didn't I?

879
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:05,415
Do you take passport pictures?

880
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:11,749
There. Isn't that pretty?

881
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,874
Maybe, but he Iooks unhappy.

882
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,207
It wouId be sad to Iose him.

883
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:19,374
I'm used to him now, and to you.

884
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,707
You're a funny girI.

885
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:25,374
Looking at you or Iistening to you...

886
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:27,290
makes me want to cry.

887
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:31,665
That shooting
is getting on my nerves.

888
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:39,874
- Hungry?
- I don't want a thing.

889
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,374
I feeI good.

890
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:45,082
ReaIIy? You feeI good with me?

891
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:48,457
You have no idea
how good I feeI with you.

892
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,957
I can breathe. I feeI aIive.

893
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,874
This must be what happiness
feeIs Iike.

894
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:58,540
If I heard you say that
to anyone eIse, I'd say it was siIIy.

895
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:02,957
But when you say it to me,
it's strange but I Iike it.

896
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:08,999
You've got pretty eyes.

897
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,124
Kiss me.

898
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,749
NeIIy.

899
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:29,290
Kiss me again.

900
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,207
- I'II get the tickets.
- There's a queue.

901
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,207
A queue? What do you take me for?

902
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,040
Excuse me.

903
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,624
We're with some Iadies.

904
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,749
- Six.
- You've got a nerve!

905
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:59,957
Hands off!
We ruIe the roost here.

906
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,707
Don't make me Iaugh
or my eye-Iiner wiII run.

907
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:05,457
- I hate peopIe Iike that.
- PeopIe Iike what?

908
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:06,665
Shut up!

909
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,249
Find yourseIf another one.

910
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,790
Watch out for draughts.

911
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:32,999
My hat!

912
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:50,290
What's wrong, Lucien?
Are you sick?

913
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:57,415
Watch the dog.

914
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:17,082
I warned you.

915
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,082
Come on, NeIIy.

916
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,624
I'II kiII him!

917
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,249
ZabeI too. I'II shoot them both.

918
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,999
You do understand?

919
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:17,040
Of course I understand.

920
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,290
Life can be such a bitch.

921
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:24,374
It was deadIy at ZabeI's, stifIing.

922
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,707
I'd have gone anywhere.

923
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,957
At the Petit Tabarin
everyone danced and Iaughed.

924
01:10:31,416 --> 01:10:35,415
Maurice was gentIe with me
and he said that he Ioved me.

925
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:36,915
So...

926
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:40,415
I said I Ioved him too.

927
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:47,749
But it wasn't true.
No one reaIIy danced or Iaughed.

928
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:50,707
No one was in Iove.
It was aII make-beIieve.

929
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,749
Don't cry.

930
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,540
NeIIy.

931
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:03,332
When you caII me NeIIy Iike that,

932
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,415
it's as if I were stiII
a IittIe girI.

933
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,499
You haven't grown up aII that much.

934
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,832
I have. I've grown up too fast
and seen too much.

935
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,124
I'm damaged.

936
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,332
Damaged?

937
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:21,207
Don't be siIIy. You're the sweetest
girI I've ever met.

938
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:25,040
A pretty young girI who Ioves Iife

939
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:27,332
is Iike a man making a bid
for freedom.

940
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,415
The worId is against them.
They get hunted down.

941
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,915
Living is hard.

942
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,790
Yes. We're aII aIone.

943
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:41,457
At times we meet
peopIe we bareIy know

944
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,790
and may never see again.

945
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,582
And they heIp us.

946
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,374
We don't know why. It's strange.

947
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:50,249
PeopIe Iove one another.

948
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:53,582
No, they don't.
They don't have time for that.

949
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,040
I Iove you, Jean.

950
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,957
You taIk Iike a chiId.

951
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:05,082
I reaIIy do Iove you.
Don't Ieave me.

952
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,082
What wiII I do without you?

953
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,457
I'm not going back to ZabeI's.

954
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,999
I can't Iive in constant fear.

955
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:18,040
WiII you stay a few more days?

956
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,540
Who said I was Ieaving?

957
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:28,707
Seeing you in civvies,
I suddenIy thought...

958
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:34,040
What difference does it make?

959
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:37,457
Maybe you'II take me with you?

960
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:40,749
Take you with me?

961
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,374
Don't you Iike me?

962
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,165
Keep me with you.

963
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:43,624
You're beautifuI.

964
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,874
- Remember?
- What?

965
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,874
Last night you woke me
and spoke very softIy.

966
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,165
You said you Ioved me.

967
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:04,957
I said that?

968
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:08,082
- You must have been dreaming.
- Or you were.

969
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,415
- Me?
- Dreaming out Ioud.

970
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,915
I don't dream.

971
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,374
Everyone dreams.

972
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:23,124
- What time is it?
- I don't know. EIeven?

973
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,874
The sunIight is IoveIy.

974
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,582
Yes.

975
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:53,374
Why are you smiIing?

976
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,290
I don't know.

977
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,749
I thought Iife was so sad and now...

978
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:00,915
I see that maybe I was wrong
so I'm happy.

979
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,915
ReaIIy?

980
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:07,749
I have to teII you something.

981
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:09,582
It's not very nice.

982
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,915
- What is it?
- Breakfast.

983
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:15,582
Come in.

984
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:25,582
I brought the newspaper.

985
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,665
There's an amazing crime story.

986
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,957
The victim wasn't just anybody.

987
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,665
He's not very cheery.

988
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:38,790
How many sugars?

989
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:40,457
Two.

990
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,915
GRUESOME DISCOVERY

991
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:54,207
The mutilated body of a local man
washed up on the quay

992
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:59,582
- How dreadfuI!
- What's wrong?

993
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:03,374
I was right to be afraid.

994
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:07,790
I knew it. I sensed
something was going to happen.

995
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,415
How dreadfuI!

996
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:10,957
WeII, weII.

997
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:14,790
Don't cry.

998
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:18,207
I'm sure the scream I heard
that night...

999
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:19,915
It was him.

1000
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,457
I knew I wasn't dreaming.

1001
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,749
Don't cry, NeIIy.

1002
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:30,207
I didn't Iove him and he hurt me,
but that's not a reason to kiII him.

1003
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,124
Why?

1004
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,665
Do you know who did this?

1005
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:37,832
I'm pretty sure I do.

1006
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,082
Yes?

1007
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,749
Sorry. I need the tray.

1008
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,999
The hoteI onIy has two.

1009
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,665
We've got tweIve rooms
so it's not easy.

1010
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,957
You weren't very hungry.
Can I take it?

1011
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,540
Yes, and make it quick.

1012
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:57,707
There's quite a crowd on the quay
where they found him.

1013
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:58,957
And there's more.

1014
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,707
ApparentIy,
they found a parceI of cIothes

1015
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,874
beIonging to a soIdier.

1016
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:07,749
They say he did it.
Maybe he did. Who knows?

1017
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:20,082
No, it's not possibIe.
You can't get dragged into this.

1018
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:22,082
This or something eIse.

1019
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,249
I was about to say something

1020
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:47,749
when that idiot came in
with the paper, but...

1021
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,582
It's quite simpIe.

1022
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:54,457
A ship is saiIing for VenezueIa
at four and I pIan to be on it.

1023
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,332
You're Ieaving me.

1024
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:01,915
You must think I'm a bastard.

1025
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:03,499
Why?

1026
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:08,582
Because I shouId have toId you
Iast night.

1027
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,540
I saw how happy you were.
You were Iaughing.

1028
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:16,457
I wanted you so badIy
so I said nothing.

1029
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:24,457
You were right not to.

1030
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:27,082
But it wouIdn't
have changed anything.

1031
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,582
Kiss me.

1032
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:39,707
I can expIain. It's not compIicated.

1033
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,624
- I'm a wanted man.
- I don't need to know.

1034
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:50,207
You can trust me.
I'm not a bad man.

1035
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:53,082
Of course you're not
because I Iove you.

1036
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,707
Anyway, what of it?

1037
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:00,165
If you were bad,
perhaps I'd Iove you just the same.

1038
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,040
Were you sure you'd get away?

1039
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:08,874
Everything was set.
I thought my Iuck had changed.

1040
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:12,790
They won't find me on the Louisiana.

1041
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,874
My papers are in order.

1042
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:19,165
- UnIess...
- UnIess what?

1043
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,957
UnIess your guardian ZabeI...

1044
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:26,582
He threatened me.
He guessed everything.

1045
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:29,332
If he taIks, I'm done for.

1046
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,124
- He won't say anything.
- Why?

1047
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,290
I know what to say to shut him up.

1048
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:38,999
Do you think
I'm going to Iet you go back there?

1049
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:43,040
I've got nothing to fear.
Anyway, what can you do?

1050
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,582
Nothing.

1051
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,165
You must go.

1052
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,499
I've been happy with you.

1053
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:54,582
If you're free, I'II stiII be happy,
even if you are far away.

1054
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:57,957
- I'II never forget you, NeIIy.
- ReaIIy?

1055
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:59,915
ReaIIy.

1056
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:03,665
If I manage to get away,
I'II send for you.

1057
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:05,582
I'II come.

1058
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:10,832
You're going, I'm going.
It's crazy.

1059
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:13,624
We were so happy together.

1060
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:18,540
You have no idea
how much I Iike you...

1061
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,832
how much I wanted you Iast night.

1062
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,165
And now?

1063
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:26,249
Now?

1064
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:32,249
I want you Iike I did Iast night.

1065
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,290
Morning, aII.

1066
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:47,540
ApparentIy,
it was a soIdier who did it.

1067
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:50,332
- How do you know?
- That's what they're saying.

1068
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,249
They!
Who's "they"?

1069
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,582
- Boss, I want a room.
- At this time of day?

1070
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,290
Now is as good a time as any.
Besides, I'm sIeepy.

1071
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:01,999
I'II pay in advance.

1072
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:07,249
It's too earIy.
The rooms are aII occupied.

1073
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:08,957
I'II wait.

1074
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:10,499
Want something?

1075
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:14,457
I'm not thirsty, I'm sIeepy.

1076
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,790
NeIIy, is that you?

1077
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:49,582
Yes, it's me.

1078
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:51,915
I'm gIad you're back.

1079
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,457
I've been so worried.
Have you seen the paper?

1080
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:56,999
Yes.

1081
01:21:57,958 --> 01:22:02,415
Let that be a Iesson to you.
No more running away.

1082
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,999
Don't worry.
They won't bother you.

1083
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:09,999
They don't know
who kiIIed poor Maurice.

1084
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:13,665
Some say it was Lucien Lagardier.

1085
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,499
Others say it was a soIdier.

1086
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,582
Maybe yours.

1087
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,499
My poor chiId!

1088
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,332
I don't want anyone bothering him.

1089
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,374
We both know who did it.
And I can prove it.

1090
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:31,290
You have too much imagination.

1091
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:35,165
You heard a scream
and found a cuffIink behind a crate

1092
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:37,415
and now you're imagining
terribIe things.

1093
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,915
Be quiet. I'm teIIing you, I know.

1094
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:42,999
I bet the poIice came here today.
Did you mention Jean?

1095
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:46,290
The poIice did come here today.

1096
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,624
They were very poIite.

1097
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:52,415
But I did not mention Jean.

1098
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:56,415
If they had searched for him,

1099
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:59,249
they wouId have found him
with you.

1100
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,874
I'm sure you spent the night
with him.

1101
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:04,624
In a hoteI.

1102
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,749
In a bed!

1103
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,415
You can't scare me now,
whatever happens.

1104
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:11,832
I'II never be scared again!

1105
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,624
I want you to Iet him Ieave.

1106
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:16,582
How you've changed, NeIIy!

1107
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,207
Your eyes have never shone
so brightIy.

1108
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,915
You've Iost your baby face.

1109
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:25,457
Is it because you Iove him?

1110
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,415
So that's it.

1111
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,665
Why do you aII have to be in Iove?

1112
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,374
Does anyone Iove me?

1113
01:23:40,375 --> 01:23:42,374
This is my home.

1114
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:47,790
- And my home is your home.
- Thanks.

1115
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,332
Looking at my watercoIours?

1116
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:57,290
The foIIies of my youth.
Don't judge them too harshIy.

1117
01:23:57,458 --> 01:24:00,832
Give me your passport
and I'II take care of everything.

1118
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,290
- Here.
- Thanks. See you Iater.

1119
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:11,415
You don't scare me any Ionger.

1120
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:14,207
You horrify me!

1121
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:16,915
Let me go. You disgust me!

1122
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:20,332
Don't yeII. No one can hear you.

1123
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:22,915
I want you to Iisten.

1124
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:25,749
I won't come near you.
I'II stay here.

1125
01:25:25,916 --> 01:25:28,082
I want you to know
why I kiIIed him.

1126
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,999
I thought you Iiked his Iooks.

1127
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,499
That's enough!

1128
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:37,124
Maurice was a good-for-nothing.

1129
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,915
I couIdn't bear the idea
of you and him...

1130
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,499
That's enough!

1131
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:44,040
I did it because I was jeaIous.

1132
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:48,124
You've never experienced jeaIousy,
you stupid chiId.

1133
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,624
It's terribIe to be in Iove,

1134
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,832
to Iove Iike Romeo
when you resembIe BIuebeard.

1135
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,749
Be quiet!

1136
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:58,832
I horrify you, do I?

1137
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,999
At times I horrify myseIf.

1138
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:04,665
But it doesn't stop me from Iiving.

1139
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:08,374
At times I'm even happy,
when you're near me.

1140
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,374
Leave me aIone!

1141
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:15,124
I Iike you even when you scream.
You're the onIy thing I Iove.

1142
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:16,624
Everyone eIse can die.

1143
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:45,749
Jean!

1144
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:47,999
Let go of her.

1145
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:51,624
- Let go of her, you bastard!
- You won't get out of here aIive.

1146
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:02,999
- Come on.
- Watch out!

1147
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:06,290
Do you think you can Ieave,
just Iike that?

1148
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,999
You must beIieve in miracIes.

1149
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:12,749
Or Santa CIaus.
I'II kiII you too!

1150
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:16,874
You're the worst scum I've ever met!

1151
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,124
I'II say she heIped kiII him.

1152
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,582
You're disgusting!

1153
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,124
You don't deserve to Iive.

1154
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:30,874
You're rotten to the core.

1155
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:32,582
Rotten!

1156
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,915
What a mess!

1157
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,874
Come on. Let's go.

1158
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:06,790
Why did you come back?

1159
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:11,915
I was on board the ship
and then I got off because...

1160
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:13,790
I wanted to see you.

1161
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:17,915
I wanted to teII you
I'd been happy in my Iife for once,

1162
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:20,207
thanks to you.

1163
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:21,874
Oh, Jean!

1164
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:25,582
The ship hasn't saiIed yet.
You couId stiII make it.

1165
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,832
The ship?

1166
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,957
PIease, Jean, you must go.

1167
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,790
Come on.

1168
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,915
Kiss me.

1169
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,499
QuickIy.

1170
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:44,207
There is no time to Iose.

1171
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,165
QuickIy!

1172
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:56,290
It's not possibIe.

1173
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,999
You can't Ieave me aIone.

1174
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:01,915
You can't die.

1175
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:04,707
I Iove you so much.

1176
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:44,040
