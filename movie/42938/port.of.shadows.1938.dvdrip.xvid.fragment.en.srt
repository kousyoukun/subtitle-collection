1
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,976
PORT OF SHADOWS

2
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,943
LE HAVRE - 12 MILES

3
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,803
- Going to Le Havre?
- Yeah. Get in.

4
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,175
Thanks.

5
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,955
- Tired?
- Yes.

6
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,130
On leave?

7
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,333
You don't talk much.

8
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,236
No, not much.

9
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,941
Cigarette?

10
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,022
Thanks.

11
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,703
We're here.

12
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,976
Le Havre.

13
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,305
Oh, yeah.

14
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,581
Look at this fog.

15
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,422
I know all about it.
I was in Tonkin.

16
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,423
Are you kidding?
There's no fog in Tonkin.

17
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,292
No fog?

18
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,490
Sure there is. In here.

19
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,272
Are you nuts?
Pulling a stunt like that for a dog?

20
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,878
- It's still a dog.
- And it's still my hide!

21
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,212
Take quinine if you're delirious.
Tonkin or not, don't mess with my truck!

22
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,712
Your truck, your hide.

23
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,716
If you don't like it,
why don't we take it outside?

24
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,449
Fine with me!

25
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,890
We really gonna fight over a dog?

26
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,199
Don't think I'm backing down.

27
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,831
All I had to do was bust your face,

28
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,200
and you could say
bye-bye to your wrench.

29
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,970
I thought you might pull a gun.

30
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,972
A gun!

31
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,208
Shut up.
You don't know what you're saying.

32
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,516
Just give me a cigarette.

33
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,655
Using a gun looks easy.

34
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,589
Like shooting wooden ducks at a fair.

35
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,266
You shoot...

36
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,429
and then some guy screams.

37
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,342
He holds his stomach and makes
a face like a kid with a bellyache.

38
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,678
His hands turn red,
and then he drops.

39
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:56,187
You're left standing there.
You don't understand a thing.

40
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,290
Like everything around you
has disappeared.

41
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,865
Anyway, here I am. Thanks.

42
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,932
No hard feelings?
- 'Course not.

43
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,939
- Bye.
- Want the pack?

44
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,271
- What about you?
- I've got more.

45
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,342
In that case, sure. Thanks.

46
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,846
Bye.

47
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,816
Good luck.

48
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,615
THE LITTLE JOKER

49
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,168
All this fun is killing me.

50
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,172
Think he'll finish soon?
- I don't know.

51
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,436
You never know anything.

52
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,379
Come dance, Lucien?

53
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,854
I said wait at the bar.
We're talking.

54
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,151
Fine.

55
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,262
You chose this place to meet,
but I hate places like this.

56
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,828
This is the worst kind of music.
I only enjoy fine music.

57
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,303
We know about your music.

58
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,140
You don't know anything.
You're delinquents, petty crooks.

59
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,173
Right. Keep the jokes coming.

60
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,975
Isn't he funny?

61
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,146
If you say so.

62
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,223
The Orphan thinks you're funny,
and he's not much of a joker.

63
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,022
You make us laugh,
and that's a fact.

64
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,822
Laugh all you want to.

65
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,699
You should be ashamed
of the lives you lead.

66
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,663
Your parents were fine people,
and here you are playing gangsters.

67
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,101
It's demoralizing.

68
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,303
You could've learned piano.
A beautiful thing, the piano.

69
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,178
Listen, Zabel,
you've had your say now.

70
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,140
Enough is enough.

71
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,378
Where's Maurice?

72
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,083
Maurice?
Ah, handsome Maurice.

73
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,594
I have no idea.
He used to come visit me too.

74
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,094
But when I saw
he'd become a hoodlum like you,

75
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,963
I told him not to bother.

76
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,638
This music!

77
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,535
Listen, Zabel, Maurice is missing.

78
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,339
And since we had a falling out -

79
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,705
- Women problems, no doubt.
- Whatever you say.

80
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,711
But people think I did it.

81
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,148
Deep down you're flattered.

82
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,211
But since it could prove inconvenient,
you'd like to know.

83
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,516
Exactly.

84
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,193
And I'm sure you know all about it.

85
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,728
Yes. All about it.

86
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,433
You're mistaken, my lambs.
I don't know a thing.

87
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,695
You should have more respect.

88
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,398
I'm old enough to be your father.

89
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:12,271
I'm an honest businessman,
a rare enough thing these days.

90
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,807
I'll leave you the bill,
since you invited me.

91
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,952
Would you be so kind
as to give me my hat and coat?

92
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,623
Beautiful. Plays us for chumps,
then ups and leaves.

93
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,088
Let him go.

94
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,766
We'll go by his place later.

95
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,462
- What for?
- To have a look around.

96
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,596
<i>I told you to beat it!</i>

97
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,069
You could at least be polite.

98
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,676
I asked the price of a room.

99
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:50,043
You're dressed like a bellhop,

100
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,216
so tell me the price of a room.

101
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:56,048
- I said this isn't a hotel!
- So you won't tell me the price?

102
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,015
It's not for tonight, anyway.
I'm broke.

103
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,190
But someday I might -

104
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,225
Beat it or you'll be sorry!

105
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,196
- Sorry.
- No harm done, buddy.

106
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,962
That bellhop's a real brute!

107
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,138
Scram, buddy. I'm in a hurry.

108
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,536
It's not every night I meet a friend.

109
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,769
I'm no fan of soldiers,
but I feel sorry for 'em.

110
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:26,113
I could've been one if I hadn't
fallen on my head the day of the draft.

111
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,552
- Scram, will you?
- You a brute, too?

112
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,949
No, but I asked you
to leave me alone.

113
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,979
I see what's going on.

114
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,651
Sticking to me like glue!

115
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,652
- Your dog?
- No.

116
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,497
If you're looking for a hideout,
maybe I can help.

117
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,225
- The problem is I'm broke.
- I'll take you to Panama's.

118
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,202
- Panama's?
- The safest place on the coast.

119
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,377
Better than any seaside resort.

120
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,014
Four planks, a door and a roof.

121
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,697
- My dream -
- Dream on your feet and you'll fall down.

122
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,265
Who cares?

123
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,670
We're here.
Over there, where the light is.

124
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:00,739
My dream is to sleep just once
between real white sheets.

125
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,776
One on top
and another one under me.

126
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,682
Your mutt's back.

127
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,422
I said it wasn't mine.

128
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,386
Beat it, will you?

129
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,892
I've got no dog, no nothing.

130
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,297
- Don't like dogs?
- Don't like anyone looking for a master.

131
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,197
Haven't you found your own?

132
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,634
Not yet.

133
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,409
<i>- Who's there?
- Half-Pint.</i>

134
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,239
Open up. I'm with a friend.

135
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,757
Come in.

136
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,528
Good evening.

137
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,271
- Want a drink?
- I'm not thirsty. I'm tired.

138
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,076
Even if I was, I'm broke.

139
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,072
Doesn't matter.
My house is your house.

140
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:17,117
I'm warning you, don't go on
about the fog or your problems.

141
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,151
There's no fog here.
It's always fair weather.

142
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,157
The hands are nailed down.

143
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,428
So...

144
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,723
keep your secrets to yourself.

145
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,993
Don't worry.
I'm not a big talker.

146
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,965
I am, but I'm discreet.

147
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,640
What do you think of this?

148
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,407
Genuine.

149
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,108
I bought it down in Panama.

150
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,075
In 1906.

151
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,818
Splits the Americas in two.
You cross in a boat.

152
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,315
You're down below
and the monkeys are up above.

153
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,152
Blue monkeys.
It's marvelous.

154
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,658
Tired?
- A bit.

155
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,334
Forgive me.

156
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,829
It's none of my business
if you're tired or not.

157
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,509
I don't usually ask questions.

158
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,169
No big deal, pal.

159
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,115
Put that down, idiot!

160
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,650
You know the crew comes loose.
You already swallowed a cabin boy.

161
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,217
Panama, 1906.

162
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,386
Thirty-two years in a bottle.

163
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,864
And you were going
to guzzle it down, fleabag.

164
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,732
When I'm thirsty -

165
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,266
Ah, who cares!
What I'd really like -

166
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,168
I know.
To sleep in white sheets.

167
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,483
- Hi, Panama.
- Hi, Michel.

168
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,348
We've got company tonight.

169
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,261
Yeah, fashionable society.

170
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,593
Oh, society is what it is,
a bit sinister, a bit seamy.

171
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,232
But I've heard
there are beautiful things in it too.

172
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,068
- Why not paint them?
- Paint them?

173
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,767
I tried.
I painted flowers, women, children.

174
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,147
It's like I painted
the crime right into it.

175
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,111
I'd see a crime in a rose.

176
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,656
It's called painting
with a palette knife.

177
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,224
What could be simpler than a tree?

178
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,557
But when I paint one,
it sets everyone on edge.

179
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,058
It's because there's someone
or something hidden behind that tree.

180
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,929
I can't help painting
what's hidden behind things.

181
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,399
To me, a swimmer
is already a drowned man.

182
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,643
- A still life, eh?
- Shut up, idiot.

183
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,805
I'm the idiot.

184
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,311
You have to be an idiot to go on living
with such discontent, such anxiety.

185
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,448
Don't you think?
- I think you're damn complicated.

186
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,756
It'll all work out.

187
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,627
I'm done.
I've come full circle.

188
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,035
Still thinking of suicide?

189
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,498
Some people go fishing
or hunting or to war.

190
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,375
Others commit crimes of passion.

191
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,639
Some commit suicide.
You have to kill someone.

192
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,948
- That's life.
- Yes.

193
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,552
For example, you drink.

194
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,057
You drink to kill something inside
that bothers you.

195
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,648
Me?

196
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,355
I drink to get drunk!

197
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,730
Same thing.

198
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,367
And you, I'm sure if I painted you -

199
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,129
Leave me out of this.

200
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,763
You'd have your hands
in your pockets on a foggy night -

201
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,705
That's enough, damn it!

202
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,437
You yak and yak
and spout your big ideas.

203
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,304
Big ideas bug me!

204
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,178
- You been drinking, too?
- Shut up. What would you know?

205
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,212
I'm hot under the collar
so you think I'm drunk.

206
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,880
Well, I'm not.
I haven't eaten in two days.

207
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,152
It'd make a great tattoo
on my belly:

208
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,332
- Don't they feed you in the army?
- What do you care?

209
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,069
If you're hungry, just say so.

210
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,732
I know. I'm supposed to say I'm hungry
and it'll all work out.

211
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,105
But pride makes me hold it in.

212
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,040
I've got my pride.
Funny, huh?

213
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:39,447
Bull-headed, they say.
Exactly! I'm bull-headed!

214
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,887
You're pretty bull-headed yourself.

215
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,788
You said you were hungry.

216
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,622
- Yeah, I'm hungry.
- Come with me.

217
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,640
I've got bread,
sausage and Cheshire cheese.

218
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,271
I always bought
Cheshire cheese in Panama.

219
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,260
If you haven't eaten in a while,
take it slow.

220
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,673
Aren't you gonna say
"bon appetit"?

221
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,010
Where are your manners?

222
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:57,194
Hey, mutt! Long time no see.
You're hungry too, eh?

223
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,263
- Is he yours?
- Yes.

224
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,126
He's got a pretty face.

225
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,937
So do you.

226
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,633
You're beautiful and I like you.

227
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,243
No kidding.

228
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,507
You're skinny, but I like you.

229
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,682
Like in the movies.
One look and I liked what I saw.

230
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,318
Love at first sight.

231
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,557
L-O-V-E.

232
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,653
You know, the little guy
with wings and arrows.

233
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,501
Hearts carved into trees.
Romance, and then tears.

234
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,573
It's always the same story,
the same old rotten business.

235
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,173
You really mean that?

236
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,082
- What?
- What you said about love.

237
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,382
Dames are always like that.

238
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,857
Out hustling, but sappy
as a dime-store romance.

239
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,027
What did you say? Hustling?

240
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,229
Yeah.

241
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,068
You take English in school?
Hustling. Turning tricks.

242
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,239
Why are you talking to me like this?

243
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,901
Listen to this!

244
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,909
Don't tell me you're here
to bring Grandma some cake.

245
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,878
You're not Little Red Riding Hood.

246
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,447
And that's too bad,

247
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,486
'cause I'm the Big Bad Wolf.

248
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,488
The Big Bad Wolf's a swell guy.

249
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,588
Think khaki's my color?

250
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,331
Why are you always laughing?

251
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,499
It's not a real laugh.
It's sad.

252
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,799
Ever see a dame love a soldier?

253
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,875
They love soldiers on parade,
stepping high, kicking up dust.

254
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,441
But come along in your daily gear
and watch how they treat you.

255
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,349
Why am I telling you this?
It's no use.

256
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,624
Men and women can never get along.

257
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,295
They don't talk the same.

258
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,332
Different vocabulary.

259
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,161
Maybe they can't get along,
but they can love each other.

260
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,163
Have you ever loved anyone?

261
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,679
- Not really.
- There you have it.

262
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,215
What was that?

263
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,480
I don't know.

264
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,788
- What is it?
- Bad guys.

265
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,785
You find a nice quiet place
to get away from them,

266
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,121
and that's where they come
to kill each other.

267
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,471
Great lighting.
Like a tomb.

268
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,137
- Well?
- Well, what? It's so sad.

269
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,148
Can't you even follow
a guy in a taxi?

270
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,376
We didn't lose him.
He's in that shack.

271
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,119
- What shack?
- Over there.

272
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,950
That dump? Get on.

273
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,591
I'm sure he's here.

274
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,767
Easy as pie.
We'll just go in and get him.

275
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,977
Open up.
We're dying of thirst.

276
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,142
Drinks are all gone.
We're closed.

277
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,879
If you don't open the door, we will.

278
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,181
You won't like it.
- Break it down?

279
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,989
This is your warning shot,
Panama-style.

280
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,389
Hang around and lead starts flying.
- Damn. They're going to shoot.

281
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,231
- Does the shooting scare you?
- I wish it was only that!

282
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,568
- What else?
- I can't tell you.

283
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,937
- Don't be afraid. I'm here.
- You're sweet.

284
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,040
What's your name?

285
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,078
Nelly.

286
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,951
Mine's Jean.

287
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,064
Bastards!

288
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,499
A real battle at sea!

289
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,074
The captain's going down
with the ship.

290
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,593
I think they got the hint.

291
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,775
What a beautiful night.

292
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,617
A beautiful night indeed.

293
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,017
Looks like blood.

294
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,953
Blood?

295
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,522
Hey, you!

296
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,289
What are you doing?

297
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,794
Are you hurt?

298
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,902
I must have cut my hand
when I fell.

299
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,769
May I come in?

300
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,646
Go on in.

301
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,484
The world's a strange place
in the wee hours for those with eyes to see.

302
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,188
He mustn't see me here.

303
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,394
No problem.
I don't care to see anyone either.

304
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,830
They were after me like wolves.

305
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,232
I ran and just barely got away.

306
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,500
A rum, barkeep.
- No rum here.

307
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,070
But if you'd care to wash your hands -
- Yes, I would.

308
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,076
Funny how blood stains clothes
but washes off hands so easily.

309
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,083
Ever noticed how doctors and surgeons
have such clean, white hands?

310
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,090
Even though their pretty hands
wallow in blood the whole blessed day.

311
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,260
But I'm no doctor.
I'm in novelty goods.

312
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,993
No one asked.

313
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,105
There's a bucket
of rainwater outside.

314
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,607
As you like.

315
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,539
You're an artist?

316
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,084
I'm sorry I didn't become an artist.
I adore the arts.

317
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,980
Especially music.
Religious music in particular.

318
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,589
It brings back memories.

319
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,219
I like to rummage
through old memories.

320
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,331
Family, childhood...

321
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,572
Where's your cut?
I don't see anything.

322
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,440
I thought I was hurt.
I guess I was wrong.

323
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,578
In all the excitement,
I lost my package.

324
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,255
How upsetting.

325
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,324
So it wasn't your blood?

326
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:48,129
Listen, I know nothing about you,
and it's none of my business.

327
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,800
The sun's up. You can go.

328
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,966
I don't like your face.

329
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,799
Some people have likable faces,
some don't.

330
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,776
Doesn't matter.
After all, what's a face?

331
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,046
Not much.

332
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,577
No one likes my face,
but believe it or not,

333
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,148
when I look in the mirror, I like it.

334
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,124
After all, better this head
than no head at all.

335
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,741
With every sunrise we think
something new is going to happen,

336
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,919
something fresh.

337
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,958
Then the sun goes to bed,
and so do we.

338
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,994
It's sad.

339
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,197
Did you mean what you said before?

340
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:57,957
What?

341
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,865
About love.

342
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,774
Why else would I have said it?

343
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,102
I don't know.
A line to soften up the client.

344
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,504
Client?

345
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,451
Sorry if I'm interrupting something.

346
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,541
Nothing like a cold shower
to perk a man up.

347
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,044
Fresh as a rose and ready to work!

348
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,543
- No kidding. You work?
- Yes. On the docks.

349
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,683
This holds two quarts.

350
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,823
I steal two quarts in the morning
and sell it at night.

351
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,022
I legal, of course,

352
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,392
but I'm the only thief
who recorks the barrel.

353
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,232
Professional courtesy.

354
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:04,934
Good-bye.

355
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,761
Pardon me, gorgeous,

356
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,139
but work is work.

357
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,732
Bye.

358
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,677
You staying here?

359
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,254
- Where are you headed?
- I don't know.

360
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:26,991
Just like me.

361
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,590
- Do you love life?
- What?

362
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,321
You love life?

363
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,630
It has its moments.

364
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,763
Does life love you?

365
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,907
She's been rotten to me so far,

366
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,144
but maybe she'll change,
since I love her.

367
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,649
Thanks for your hospitality.
You were great.

368
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,979
You kept me company.
I should thank you.

369
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,554
If I can do anything to help...

370
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,953
Help me? I don't know.

371
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,460
You could get me
some civvies. Anything.

372
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,600
I see.
On indefinite leave, are you?

373
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,703
- You said you didn't ask questions.
- Don't you trust me?

374
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,109
Yeah, but -

375
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,908
I only have this one old suit,
and it suits me fine.

376
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,585
But come back tonight.
I'll see what I can dig up.

377
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,181
Thanks.

378
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,152
What size shoe do you take?

379
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,400
- An eight. Why?
- Just asking.

380
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,459
Coming?

381
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,310
- Nothing ever happens by chance.
- Chance?

382
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,316
He wears a size eight, like me.

383
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,019
He needs clothes.
I've got some.

384
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:41,251
He'd like a new life,
but he'll need a pass.

385
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,886
He needs an identity.
That much is clear.

386
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,362
What luck.
I've got one too many.

387
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,694
Mine.
He might be able to use it.

388
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,032
I'm going for a swim.

389
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,540
The sea's rough and it's foggy.

390
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,878
What's that?

391
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,747
Just telling it like it is:
The sea is rough and it's foggy.

392
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,754
And that's just fine.

393
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,215
I'm no great swimmer,

394
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,754
but I have a hunch
I'll end up very far out.

395
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,097
What do you expect me to say?

396
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,494
Nothing.

397
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,600
Good.

398
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,211
Michel!

399
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,814
Don't be stupid!
What's the use?

400
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,519
Damned fog.

401
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,084
Damned filthy fog.

402
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,714
Shoes...

403
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,524
broken bottles, an old comb.

404
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,586
The bottom of the ocean's
a swell place.

405
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,732
That's not the bottom.
It's farther out, and deeper.

406
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,830
What are you, a diver?

407
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,972
How old are you?
- Seventeen.

408
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,477
Me too.

409
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,477
I was 17 too.

410
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,189
- That's funny.
- What?

411
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,784
- Look at Nelly.
- Where?

412
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,126
- Over there. With the soldier.
- Funny.

413
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,194
What the hell!

414
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,305
I thought we were going for java.
- Shut up. This'll be fun.

415
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,301
I'll be at Panama's tonight.
Why not come by?

416
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,910
If I can.

417
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,837
You have any money?

418
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,082
Why? You want some?

419
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,218
Dummy! I know you don't have any,
since you were starving.

420
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,446
Then why did you ask?

421
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,611
Hey.

422
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,139
Come over here, okay?

423
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:04,646
- What do you want?
- Nothing. Just passing by.

424
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,153
I stopped to say hello...

425
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,088
and ask how Maurice is doing.

426
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,500
You should know.
- I don't. Leave me alone.

427
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,003
Old Maurice,
already forgotten and replaced.

428
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:28,768
Incredible. You skate around
with just anyone, but you snub me.

429
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,838
Why?

430
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,240
You know I think you're beautiful.

431
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,683
You have a beautiful mouth.

432
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,188
I like it.
- Don't touch me!

433
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:48,664
Like Maurice didn't touch you, right?
Or the others? How about him?

434
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,735
Everyone but me.

435
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,263
Leave me alone!

436
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,699
Instead of wiggling your fanny
at the Little Joker,

437
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,403
you'd better stay in the shop
with your guardian.

438
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:06,482
By the way, tell Zabel
that last night's little bullfight

439
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,815
was just a warning.

440
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,820
- Don't drag me into this. It's all vile.
- Me too? Am I vile?

441
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,682
Especially you!

442
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,952
- Especially me?
- Leave me alone!

443
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,701
Why don't you leave the lady alone
like she asks?

444
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,539
I'll give you some advice:
Go on making circles in the water.

445
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,511
Soldiers are easily amused, right?

446
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,548
They spit in the water
and they're happy as clams.

447
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,154
Fine. Just leave her alone.

448
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,726
This guy thinks he's Mr. Cool.
Has it all under control.

449
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,396
Listen, it's three against one.

450
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,227
Three? Can't you count?

451
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,564
Oh, you're counting on the big guy.
Because you two aren't much.

452
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,600
- Come on.
- Leave her alone.

453
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,774
What? Soldier boy is giving orders!
Get lost!

454
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,881
- Sorry. I can get violent.
- Can't you take a joke?

455
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,587
Leaving?
In a hurry all of a sudden?

456
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,295
Stay back. Don't hit me.

457
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,388
Don't hit me!

458
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,796
I'm warning you, watch your step.
Watch out!

459
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,232
Watch out for what?

460
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,839
Not so tough now, are you?

461
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,404
You're pale, shaking like jelly.

462
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,975
Not a pretty sight.

463
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,781
A word of advice: Cross the street
if you see me coming, and quick.

464
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,680
Otherwise you'll get this!

465
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,159
Come on.

466
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,624
You coming or not?

467
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:05,229
- Get a load of Lucien. He's ready to cry.
- Some joke.

468
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,388
Why did you do that?
You don't even know if I'm worth it.

469
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,388
You said you were in a hurry.

470
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,190
I don't know anymore.
I ran away.

471
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,233
If I go back, it'll be awful.
Same thing if I don't.

472
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,003
I should go back too.

473
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,504
But like you say,
if I do, it'll be awful.

474
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,546
Good-bye, Jean.

475
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,447
If I can,
I'll go to Panama's tonight.

476
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,846
Good-bye.

477
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,293
It's me.

478
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,659
Listen to this. It's beautiful.

479
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,702
Shut up.

480
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,373
You mock anything
that's beautiful or decent.

481
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,670
Shut up! You've made fools of us
for the last time!

482
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,505
What's gotten into you?
Are you drunk or high?

483
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:01,012
I'm fed up with being humiliated.
I'm a man, you hear?

484
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,186
I'm a man and I'll prove it!

485
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,323
Put that away.
We came to talk.

486
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,816
Hotheaded youth.

487
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,696
Give the papers back.
All of them!

488
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,431
And tell us where Maurice is.

489
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,759
I bet you bumped him off!

490
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,534
Bumped him off.
Nice language.

491
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:25,206
What were you doing with your packages
down by the shore these last few nights?

492
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,003
Answer me, or -
- Or what?

493
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:33,675
Or I'll have to show you who I am.

494
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,679
I know who you are.

495
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,083
You're Lucien Legardier,
from a good family that raised you badly.

496
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,258
Too much pocket money
always leaves you wanting more.

497
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,052
So you pull some capers
and get in hot water,

498
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,764
then you come
crying to Zabel to save you.

499
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,434
You're an ungrateful wretch.
I've saved your hide many a time.

500
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:58,538
Last night you tried to run me down.
You tried to shoot me.

501
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,639
I don't know where Maurice is!

502
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,282
All I know is that
those papers are safe.

503
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,885
If it's God's will
I die a violent death,

504
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:21,222
I'm warning you,
you'll all be in big trouble.

505
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,864
You came here to scare me,
and it didn't work.

506
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,207
They came here to scare me.

507
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,709
Scare me!

508
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:40,583
Don't you worms know
I can't even scare myself?

509
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,715
Make him shut up!

510
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:48,048
Make him shut up or I'll kill him!
I swear I'll pop him!

511
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,955
- Are you nuts? What good would it do?
- Let me go!

512
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,121
Go out the back.

513
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,729
One day I'll show you I'm somebody.

514
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,063
- What's with him?
- A soldier gave him a lesson this morning.

515
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,262
Over Nelly.

516
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,398
Lucien wanted to talk to her.

517
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,273
The soldier came and slapped him silly.

518
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,946
- What did Lucien do?
- Nothing.

519
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,844
Nothing?
Those soldiers are good boys.

520
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,277
Why tell me that?
You're his friend.

521
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,546
Oh, friends!

522
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,788
Expecting someone for lunch?
- My goddaughter.

523
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,087
Think she'll come back?

524
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,560
She always has before.

525
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,268
That's her. Go away.

526
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,230
Good-bye.

527
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,178
You fly off like a swallow.

528
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,682
Leave your poor old guardian behind.

529
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,418
I've been worried sick.

530
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,992
Why'd you run away the other night?
- I was afraid.

531
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,658
What a child you are!
Why come back, then?

532
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,127
The others scare me too.
Where else can I go?

533
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,194
Aren't you happy here?

534
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,936
Haven't I always been good to you?

535
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,709
It's odd. Still a little girl,

536
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,947
but already a woman.

537
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,016
Don't look at me like that!

538
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,620
- Where were you last night?
- Nowhere. I took a walk.

539
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,884
You followed the troops.
Handsome soldiers, right?

540
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,118
Hey.

541
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,989
Is it leaving soon?
- Tomorrow.

542
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,493
- Where to?
- Venezuela, I think.

543
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,529
CRUISES

544
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,039
Can I help you?

545
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,075
No, just looking.

546
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,957
I'll go. You must be tired.

547
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:54,298
- May I help you?
- I'd like the little box in the window.

548
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:59,335
I'd like it engraved "Jean and Nelly"
with today's date. It's a souvenir.

549
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,149
It's good to see a man with feelings.
People are so callous today.

550
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,327
This man would like
to give you a present.

551
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,629
Your present to Nelly
will be my present to you.

552
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,298
A friend of my goddaughter
is a friend of mine.

553
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,009
Do you like animals?

554
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,349
Animals don't like me.

555
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,514
May I help you?
- I'd like some postcards.

556
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,565
Why did you come here?
Did you follow me?

557
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,728
No. I was walking
and saw the shop, so I came in.

558
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,038
Why buy me a souvenir?

559
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,174
I've got money to burn.
I don't like women's money.

560
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,710
Men's money, women's money.
What's the difference?

561
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,217
Sorry, but business is business.

562
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,955
Will you have coffee with us?

563
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,453
Thanks, but -

564
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,216
Come now. Soldiers aren't known
to stand on ceremony.

565
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,561
Come in.

566
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,029
You're on leave, right?

567
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,235
You're not from here.

568
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,133
I bet you're from Paris.
- Right.

569
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,705
It's obvious.

570
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,866
Have a seat.

571
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,802
Everyone's welcome here.

572
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,742
Are you visiting family?

573
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,921
Nelly, get some cognac
from the cellar.

574
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,257
Nice, isn't she?

575
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,800
She runs away from time to time,
but nothing serious.

576
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,737
I've heard her mother did the same.

577
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:18,139
She runs away, but nothing serious.

578
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,812
Her mother ran away one day
and never returned.

579
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,486
The child lived with her father.

580
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,357
A fine man, but then he died.

581
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,737
More coffee?

582
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,982
I'm sure it's better
than what you're used to.

583
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,660
- You enjoy military life?
- You get to travel.

584
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,763
- Have you been in Le Havre long?
- Since last night.

585
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,340
Pretty town, isn't it?

586
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,836
What's wrong?

587
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,788
Come on, Nelly.

588
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,826
Don't touch me!

589
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,830
- Wait. I must speak to you.
- Let him go! What do you want with him?

590
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:48,562
You're feverish.
Come lie down for a while.

591
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,239
I'll take you to your room.

592
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,041
Come, my dear.

593
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,996
Such a sensitive child.
The slightest thing sets her off.

594
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,565
You were at Panama's last night.

595
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,067
What's it to you?

596
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,673
I didn't see you, but I saw your dog.
He growled at me.

597
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,936
Nelly was there, wasn't she?

598
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,047
I don't answer
questions I don't like.

599
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,046
Only people with guilty consciences
spend the night at Panama's.

600
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,057
Is that so?

601
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,260
I have you in mind
as much as myself when I say that.

602
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,060
Are you good
at remembering numbers? I am.

603
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,395
For example: 3614.

604
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,435
I saw it once and I remember it.
- What?

605
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:01,709
Drop the act. It's your serial number.
I saw it on your shirt.

606
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,277
So what?

607
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,414
Just that.

608
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:11,017
For people who do me favors,
I know how to keep a secret.

609
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,681
And for the rest?

610
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,754
For the rest, it depends.

611
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,029
You've already done me a favor
without knowing it.

612
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,657
By beating up Lucien Legardier.

613
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,463
- Who?
- This morning on the docks.

614
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,662
I know what goes on,

615
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,307
and what I don't know, I can guess.

616
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,809
You didn't come
to Le Havre by chance.

617
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,212
That's none of your business.

618
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,685
Perhaps, but I'm interested.

619
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,088
You came here for the ships.

620
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,090
You did something stupid
and you want to get away.

621
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,917
Change your identity.

622
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,795
You want to leave, and I can help.
- I didn't ask you.

623
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,594
If you need money, I've got it.

624
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,298
Identification, a passport, too.

625
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,138
Lucien Legardier is
an immoral good-for-nothing.

626
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,407
He follows me. He threatens me.
He's capable of anything.

627
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,611
- So?
- So I help you and you help me.

628
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,185
Everyone's happy.

629
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,519
Lucien is on the dock at night.

630
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,623
So are you.

631
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,333
You push him. He falls in.
It's child's play.

632
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,868
Society is better off
with one less good-for-nothing.

633
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,564
It's worth thinking about.

634
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,544
Yeah? Well, I just did.

635
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:49,511
In Tonkin I saw
this squishy, disgusting bug.

636
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,711
Made me sick just to look at it.

637
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,415
They're called centipedes.
That's what you're like.

638
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:00,194
Your voice is nasty. Sounds like
walking in muck with old sandals.

639
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,126
My voice may be peculiar, but you -

640
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,891
I am what I am!

641
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,261
Every awful thing I've done
was because I was angry.

642
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:12,399
Because every time something good
happens, scum like you mess it up!

643
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,942
You make me sick.
I don't squash roaches!

644
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,086
Come on.

645
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,899
I couldn't stay.
I was waiting for you.

646
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,233
Watch out for -
- Your guardian?

647
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:47,137
With family like that,
I can see why you keep running away.

648
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,371
I want to see you tonight.

649
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,343
- Where?
- I don't know. Anywhere.

650
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,848
There's a carnival on the pier.
- A big one?

651
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,917
No, very small.

652
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,954
At the far end, there's a carousel
with white rabbits. I'll meet you there.

653
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,954
- What time?
- 9:00.

654
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,461
Snazzy shoes!

655
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,240
That's why he asked me my size.

656
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,737
And I yelled at the poor guy.

657
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,311
Too bad he's gone.
I'd have thanked him.

658
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,177
Know where he went?

659
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,346
People come and go.

660
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,957
Buddy, we're all just passing through.

661
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,452
It's my lucky day.

662
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,491
I'm not usually lucky...

663
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,800
but today's my lucky day.

664
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,507
Funny how light a hat feels
when you're not used to it.

665
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:53,741
Damn, it's light.

666
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,640
The pants are a little tight -

667
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,806
Ah, there's some buckles.
I can fix it.

668
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,641
Nice cloth, too.

669
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,116
He must be loaded
to give things away like this.

670
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,947
Must be.
He left this for you too.

671
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,449
Dough?

672
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,884
850 francs.

673
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,654
- 850 francs?
- And his ID. A passport.

674
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,326
- A passport? Why?
- He thought you might need it.

675
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,436
He thought! What does he care?

676
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,501
And how did he guess -
- Guess what?

677
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,045
That I wanted to leave.
Doesn't he need those?

678
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:34,215
ID is the least of his worries.

679
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:38,010
- You sure?
- I swear it's okay, so if you need it...

680
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,014
"Michel Krauss.

681
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,223
Height: 5'7". Average nose.

682
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,553
Brown hair."

683
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,192
It's incredible how alike
men are on paper.

684
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,126
You'll have to change the picture.
- No problem.

685
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,600
- And fix the stamp and signature.
- Easy enough.

686
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,272
Here.

687
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,879
If nobody claims it
within a year, it's yours.

688
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,715
Thanks. I'm not so good
with words, you know.

689
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,748
You coming?

690
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,817
You forgot your paint box.

691
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,793
You're Michel Krauss.
A painter.

692
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,732
That's right.

693
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,071
Good-bye.

694
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,931
- When do you set sail?
- Tomorrow at 5:00.

695
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,666
- For Venezuela?
- Yes.

696
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,196
Pretty, isn't it?

697
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,824
The ships, the sea, the men.

698
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,067
Everything's beautiful
for a painter.

699
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:14,175
I've been watching you,
I knew right away you were a painter.

700
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:18,539
In my youth,
I almost became one myself.

701
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,873
It was in my blood.

702
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,281
Then I became a doctor. Madness!

703
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,789
Standing before you is
"The Doctor in Spite of Himself'!

704
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:32,621
<i>Dr. Molne,
ship doctor on the Louisiana.</i>

705
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,794
- Michel Krauss.
- You wouldn't say no to a drink, right?

706
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,729
- No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.
- I've got a lot to do, too.

707
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:45,565
I leave tomorrow, but that doesn't stop me
from having a drink. On the contrary!

708
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,074
- You're leaving?
- For Venezuela.

709
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:54,078
If that appeals to you,
it's a fine ship. You'd love it.

710
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:59,054
Voyages are a source of renewal
for painters.

711
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,291
- You take passengers?
- Are you joking?

712
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,153
You really want to go?

713
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,697
Why not? Nothing's stopping me.

714
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:14,061
If it's not too expensive -
- Everyone knows about starving artists!

715
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,741
Come, young man.
Big decisions call for little bottles.

716
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:36,856
Hey there.

717
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,357
You look happy.
Had a good day?

718
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,864
Two quarts of the good stuff.

719
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,034
- Where are you going?
- To bed.

720
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,912
- Bartender.
- What can I get you?

721
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,650
- A room.
- Right away.

722
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,156
- What about my rum?
- Coming.

723
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,353
Something to drink?
- No.

724
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,323
All right, just a little one.

725
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,761
- A little what?
- A little rum.

726
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,428
But in a big glass.

727
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:31,243
I ask purely as a formality.
Artists are such bohemians.

728
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,247
Of course. My papers are in order.
My passport -

729
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,115
Perfect.
I'll arrange it with the captain.

730
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:41,319
I've done some watercolors.
I'd like your opinion. You like it?

731
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,683
Watercolor? Yes.

732
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,018
Are you a landscapist?

733
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:47,890
I'm not much for theories -

734
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,666
- You're not a Cubist, are you?
- Cubist? Of course not.

735
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:55,065
Thank God.
Cubism's not my thing.

736
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,671
What kind of painter are you?

737
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:01,801
Well...

738
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:07,712
generally, I paint
what's hidden behind things.

739
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,546
How interesting.

740
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,121
For example, if I see a swimmer,

741
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,386
I immediately think he'll drown,
so I paint a drowned man.

742
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,124
Well...

743
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,561
your paintings
can't be very cheerful.

744
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:29,365
Still, it's not the subject that matters,
but how it's painted.

745
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,530
To your health.

746
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,979
Another, bartender.
Mustn't keep friends apart.

747
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,882
What about the room?
You want it or don't you?

748
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:46,578
Oh, yeah.

749
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,821
How much is the room?
- Eighteen francs.

750
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,328
- And what do I owe here?
- Eighteen francs.

751
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,823
I'll pay my bill.

752
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,231
What about the room?

753
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,642
Too late. Bye.

754
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:12,645
Don't be late.
The tide waits for no man.

755
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,974
You have much baggage?

756
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,709
Very little. One bag.

757
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,548
One bag?

758
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:21,515
You're leaving
for Venezuela with one bag?

759
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,456
That's marvelous!

760
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,961
That's my idea of an artist.

761
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,529
No baggage.
Independence, freedom.

762
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,791
Freedom is a fine thing.

763
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:34,898
Yes, it is.

764
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:40,042
Of course, you're not leaving for good.
But all the same -

765
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,210
You're not attached to anyone?

766
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,349
No one.

767
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,692
Ready! Don't move!

768
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,766
One, two, three.

769
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,393
Thank you very much.

770
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,800
Pity the trip's already over.

771
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,609
Wouldn't it be nice
to sail away together?

772
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:17,603
Together?

773
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,281
That reminds me - wait here.
I have to get my picture taken.

774
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,680
- Again?
- I need it.

775
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,478
To send to a woman?

776
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,457
Really?
- I told you.

777
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,358
I need a small passport photo.

778
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:43,128
- You're pretty like that.
- Pretty, but not happy.

779
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:46,935
It'd be awful if you lost him.
I've gotten used to him.

780
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:50,011
And to you.
- You're a funny girl.

781
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,308
Just looking at you
and hearing your voice...

782
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,342
makes me want to cry.

783
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,448
Let's go. Their guns
are giving me a headache!

784
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:10,063
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks. I feel good.

785
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,893
Really? You feel good with me?

786
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,063
You have no idea
how good I feel with you.

787
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,398
I'm free. I'm alive.

788
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,703
This is what happiness must be like.

789
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,408
If you talked nonsense like that
to someone else, I'd think it was dumb.

790
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:31,780
But when you say it to me,
I really like it.

791
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:37,816
You've got beautiful eyes.

792
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:42,959
Kiss me.

793
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,507
Kiss me again.

794
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,429
- I'll get the tickets.
- What about the line?

795
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,465
Wait in line?
Who do you think I am?

796
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,729
Coming through.
We're with the ladies.

797
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,073
Six tickets.
- You've got some nerve!

798
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,143
Don't act like a big man.
We're the bosses.

799
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,745
Don't make me laugh.
My mascara will run.

800
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,814
- People like that should be -
- People like what?

801
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,814
- I didn't say anything.
- You'd better not.

802
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:42,722
Scram, buddy.

803
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,910
- Watch out for the breeze!
- My hat!

804
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,226
What's wrong? Are you sick?

805
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,359
Watch the dog.

806
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,049
I warned you.

807
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,402
Come on.

808
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,713
I'll plug him.

809
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,410
I'll plug him, and Zabel too.
Pump 'em full of holes.

810
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,574
You understand?

811
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:45,910
Of course.
It's not hard to understand.

812
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,640
Life's a rotten business.

813
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:53,355
It was so gloomy at Zabel's.
I was suffocating.

814
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,518
I would've gone anywhere.

815
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:59,026
At the Little Joker,
everyone was dancing and laughing.

816
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,460
Maurice was nice to me.

817
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,124
He said he loved me.

818
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,662
So I said I loved him too.

819
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,001
But it wasn't true.

820
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:16,836
No one was really dancing
or really laughing.

821
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,879
No one was in love.
They were just going through the motions.

822
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,117
You're not going to cry, are you?

823
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,958
When you say my name like that,

824
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,023
it's like you're calling me
from far away, like when I was little.

825
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,396
You're not all that big now.

826
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:42,103
I grew up too fast.

827
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,205
I've seen too much.
I'm damaged goods.

828
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,038
Damaged goods!

829
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,274
You're nuts.

830
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,309
You're the most unspoilt girl
I've ever met.

831
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,607
When a girl's young and beautiful
and wants to live,

832
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,850
it's like a man who wants to be free -
everyone gangs up on them.

833
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,179
Like a pack of dogs.

834
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,017
Life is hard.

835
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,989
Yes, we're all alone, every one of us.

836
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,864
But sometimes you meet someone
you hardly know,

837
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,058
someone you might never see again,

838
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,896
and they help you.

839
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,502
You don't know why. It's funny.

840
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,573
It's because people love each other.

841
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,643
No, they don't.
They don't have time.

842
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,042
I love you, Jean.

843
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,315
Hush.
You're talking like a child.

844
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,147
I'm sure I really love you.

845
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:36,316
Don't leave me.
What would I do without you?

846
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,727
I can't go back to Zabel.
It's over.

847
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,224
I can't live like that, always afraid.

848
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:47,268
Will you stay a few more days?

849
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,734
Who said I was leaving?

850
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,707
When I saw you in civilian clothes,
I thought -

851
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,947
What's the difference?

852
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:06,885
If you leave,
maybe you'll take me with you.

853
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,988
Take you with me?

854
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,821
Don't you like me?

855
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,265
Never let me go.

856
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,021
You're beautiful, you know.

857
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,195
- Do you remember?
- What?

858
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,663
Last night.

859
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,130
You woke me up and whispered

860
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,499
that you loved me.

861
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,699
I said that?

862
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,605
Impossible.
You must have been dreaming.

863
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,008
- No, you were.
- Me?

864
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,738
You were dreaming out loud.

865
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,441
Dreams aren't my thing.

866
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,911
Everyone dreams.

867
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:51,654
What time is it?
- I don't know. 11:00.

868
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,010
It's pretty. The sun's out.

869
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,155
- Why are you smiling?
- I don't know.

870
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,923
I thought life was so sad.

871
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:29,392
Suddenly I see maybe
I was wrong, so I'm happy.

872
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:30,825
Really?

873
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,563
Listen, I have to talk to you,

874
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,670
but what I have to say
isn't very pretty.

875
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,840
<i>What is it?
- Breakfast.</i>

876
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,908
Come in.

877
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,845
I brought the paper.

878
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,851
There's been a sensational crime.
Everyone's talking about it.

879
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,184
And it's really one for the books.

880
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:02,960
Cheerful boy.

881
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:08,094
How many sugars?
- Two.

882
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,739
MAN'S HORRIBLY MUTILATED BODY
FOUND AT "PORT OF SHADOWS"

883
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,776
BODY IDENTIFIED AS MAURICE BREVIN

884
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,107
UNDERWORLD CONNECTIONS
HAD LONG WORRIED HIS FAMILY

885
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,777
It's awful!

886
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,288
What's wrong?

887
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,158
I was right to be afraid!

888
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,291
I knew it instinctively, like an animal.
I saw it coming.

889
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:37,797
It's awful!

890
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,465
Well, well.

891
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,302
Don't cry.

892
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:48,001
Those screams I heard that night -
I'm sure it was him.

893
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,677
I knew I hadn't dreamt it!

894
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,812
Come on, don't cry.

895
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,911
It's true I didn't love him
and that he hurt me,

896
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,315
but why kill him?

897
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:05,989
- Do you know who did it?
- I'm sure I do.

898
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,196
What is it?

899
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,060
Excuse me.
I've come for the tray.

900
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,337
We've only got two trays
and 12 rooms, so it's not easy.

901
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,331
You weren't very hungry.
Can I take it away?

902
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,066
Yeah, scram.

903
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:25,308
There's a huge crowd on the docks
where they found the body.

904
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:27,609
And the plot thickens.

905
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,840
They also dragged out
a bundle of army clothes

906
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,009
belonging to a soldier
in the Colonial forces.

907
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:36,255
They think he did it.
Who knows?

908
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:48,235
It's not possible!
You can't be involved in this!

909
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,005
If it weren't this,
it'd be something else.

910
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,883
I wanted to talk to you,

911
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:16,229
and then that jerk came in
with the paper.

912
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:19,261
It's simple.

913
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:22,697
A ship's leaving for Venezuela at 4:00,
and I'll be on it.

914
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,437
You're leaving me?

915
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,038
You must think I'm a real bastard.

916
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:31,713
Why?

917
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,711
I should've told you last night.

918
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,647
But you were so happy.
You were laughing.

919
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:44,722
And I really liked you,
so I didn't say anything.

920
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,924
You did the right thing.

921
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,427
Things would've turned out the same.

922
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,271
Kiss me.

923
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,474
I can explain if you want.
It's simple.

924
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,551
I'm a wanted man.
- I ask no questions.

925
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,121
You can trust me.
I'm not so bad.

926
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,728
You can't be bad.
I love you.

927
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:28,401
And even if you were,
I might love you still.

928
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,334
You were sure you could get away?

929
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:37,803
It was all worked out.
I thought my luck had finally turned.

930
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,477
<i>They wouldn't look for me
on the Louisiana.</i>

931
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,311
My papers are in order.

932
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,153
Unless -
- Unless?

933
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,318
Unless your guardian, Zabel...

934
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,919
He threatened me.
He'd guessed everything.

935
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,561
If he talks, I'm done for.

936
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,302
- He hasn't talked and he won't.
- Why?

937
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:04,571
Because I know something
that'll keep him quiet.

938
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,300
You think I'd let you go back there?

939
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:11,811
I've got nothing to fear.
What can you do?

940
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,969
Nothing.

941
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,941
You must go.

942
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,043
I was happy with you,

943
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:22,987
and if I know you're free, I'll be happy,
even if you're far away.

944
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,353
- I'll never forget you, Nelly.
- Truly?

945
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,361
Truly.

946
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,031
If I make it,
I'll write and you'll come join me.

947
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,200
Yes, I'll come.

948
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:39,702
You're leaving, I'm leaving -
this is stupid.

949
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,300
We were so happy together.

950
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,779
You have no idea
how crazy I am about you.

951
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,644
I was crazy about you last night.

952
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:52,542
And now?

953
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:53,915
Now?

954
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,060
Just the same as last night.

955
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,669
Greetings, everyone.

956
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,742
They say a soldier did it.

957
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:18,141
- What do you know?
- They say -

958
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:21,043
They, they, they!
Who are "they"?

959
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,415
I'd like a room.
- At this hour?

960
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:28,421
A good man sleeps when he will.

961
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,148
Besides, I'll pay in advance.

962
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:35,219
It's early still.
All the rooms are full.

963
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,796
Fine. I'll wait.

964
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:38,858
How about a drink?

965
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:42,031
I'm not thirsty, I'm tired.

966
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,625
Is that you, Nelly?

967
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,460
It's me.

968
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:21,440
It's good you came back.
I was worried.

969
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,940
Have you seen the paper?
- Yes.

970
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:30,350
I hope you learned your lesson
and you'll never run away again.

971
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:33,011
Don't worry.
They won't question you.

972
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,986
They still don't know
who killed poor Maurice.

973
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,258
Some say it was Lucien Legardier.

974
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,588
There's talk of a soldier, too.

975
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,394
Maybe it's that soldier
you know, poor child.

976
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,463
I don't want him questioned,
you hear?

977
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,133
You know very well who killed him,
and you know I can prove it!

978
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,212
You're imagining things.

979
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:03,306
Just because you heard a scream
and found a cuff link,

980
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,180
you imagine terrible things.

981
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,480
Be quiet.
I know, I tell you!

982
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,751
I'm sure the police came
and you told them about Jean.

983
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:14,393
The police did come today.

984
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,395
They were very polite to me.

985
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,933
But I didn't tell them
about Jean as you say,

986
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:26,265
because if they looked for him,
they'd have found you with him.

987
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,942
I'm sure you spent
the night with him...

988
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:32,611
in a hotel.

989
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,542
In bed!

990
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,115
You don't scare me anymore.

991
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,310
Nothing will ever
scare me again, you hear?

992
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,421
He must be allowed to leave.

993
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,748
You've changed.

994
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,451
Your eyes are shining
like they've never shone before.

995
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:50,121
You're no longer a child.

996
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,257
Is it because you love him?

997
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,395
Is that it?

998
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,702
What's all this fuss about love?

999
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,874
Does anyone love me?

1000
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,643
Welcome to my home.

1001
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:15,721
Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

1002
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,987
You're looking at my watercolors.

1003
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:24,691
Youthful blunders.
Don't judge them harshly.

1004
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:28,864
Give me your passport.
I'll take care of things.

1005
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,707
Thanks. See you later.

1006
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:38,838
You don't scare me anymore.

1007
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,776
You disgust me!
Do you hear?

1008
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,504
Let me leave!
You make me sick!

1009
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,013
It's no use shouting.
No one can hear you.

1010
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,884
I want you to listen to me.

1011
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:52,781
I won't come near you.

1012
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,282
I want you to know why I killed him.

1013
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,587
I killed him
because I thought you liked him.

1014
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,160
That's enough!

1015
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,390
That good-for-nothing Maurice.

1016
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,527
I couldn't accept that you and he -

1017
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,101
Enough!

1018
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,397
I killed him because I was jealous.

1019
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:16,075
You don't know what it's like
to be jealous, you little fool.

1020
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:22,745
It's horrible to love like Romeo
when you look like Bluebeard!

1021
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,612
Shut up!

1022
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,285
I disgust you, do I?

1023
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,315
I disgust myself too sometimes,

1024
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:32,317
but that doesn't stop me from living.

1025
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:36,495
Or even being happy sometimes,
like when you're near.

1026
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,564
Let me go!

1027
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,564
Even when you scream, I want you.

1028
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:44,267
You're the only thing I love.
Everything else can go to hell!

1029
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,136
Let her go.

1030
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,101
Take your filthy hands off her!

1031
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,102
You'll never get out of here!

1032
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,676
- Come on.
- Watch out!

1033
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,252
You think you'll get away like that?

1034
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,752
You must believe in miracles!

1035
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,460
Or Santa Claus!
I'll get you like I did him!

1036
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,597
You're the filthiest scum
I've ever seen!

1037
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,825
I'll say she helped me kill him.

1038
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,663
You filthy bastard!

1039
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:56,837
You don't deserve to live!

1040
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,603
Rotten bastard!

1041
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:10,819
Rotten bastard.

1042
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:13,552
Come on. Let's go.

1043
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:34,176
Why did you come back?

1044
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:37,908
I had already boarded,

1045
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:41,019
but I got back off
because I wanted to see you.

1046
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:48,119
I wanted to tell you that thanks to you,
I've been happy at least once in my life.

1047
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,958
The ship hasn't left yet.
Maybe you can make it.

1048
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:56,702
The ship.

1049
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,706
Please, you must leave.
Come on.

1050
01:29:05,373 --> 01:29:06,806
Kiss me.

1051
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:09,732
Quick.

1052
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,245
Quick, we've no time.

1053
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:24,390
It can't be!

1054
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,727
You can't leave me all alone.

1055
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:30,054
You can't die.

1056
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,265
I love you so much.
