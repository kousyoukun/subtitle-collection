1
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,263
Damn it! Oh!

2
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,364
Ah!

3
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,568
Jes!

4
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,156
I can't stand it, help me!

5
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,328
Help me!

6
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,157
God damn!

7
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,395
God...

8
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,440
damn!

9
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,675
It's wanting out,
now darn it, push,

10
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,113
so we can see
what's coming out on the couch.

11
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,374
Head's out almost.

12
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:18,354
God damn!

13
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,674
Oh, God! Oh...

14
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,911
Shh.

15
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,122
Come on.

16
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,147
Oh, baby, come on.

17
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,390
Oh!

18
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,558
Don't worry, baby,
I'll get somebody.

19
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,727
Mama had the baby!

20
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,533
Come on, Josephine,
he wants two of us.

21
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,135
I can't.
I'm busy.

22
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,539
Get Agnes.

23
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,880
Mama had the baby!
It's a boy!

24
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,280
A boy?

25
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,682
God damn.

26
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,417
I lost my bet.

27
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,785
Listen,
I've already paid for two,

28
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,981
I'm ready now.

29
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,492
Sure you are, sweetie,

30
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,357
and we're going
to get someone nice.

31
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,393
Violet!

32
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,794
'Cause we're going
to have ourselves a time!

33
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,628
Go and fetch Agnes yonder,
will you, baby?

34
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,565
Tell her to haul it up
to the Blue Room.

35
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,831
We're going to have ourselves
a time.

36
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,307
It's a boy.

37
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,844
It's a boy.

38
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,863
Well, Violet, old girl,
is it all over upstairs?

39
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,830
Uh-huh.

40
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,400
A boy.

41
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,765
A boy?

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,575
Does it really hurt
to have a baby?

43
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,084
Violet, you asking
the wrongest person,

44
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,814
the very wrongest person
in the world.

45
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,849
Come on and play
that thing, Professor.

46
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,757
Well, I certainly
will do that.

47
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,923
I'll play something for that
pretty baby your mama just had.

48
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,729
Brung into the cruel, cruel
world on a night like this,

49
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,066
against his will.

50
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,322
And today, I have attained

51
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,591
my 75th birthday, and
I intend to celebrate!

52
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,131
I haven't had a woman

53
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,064
in longer than I care to say.

54
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,967
You know, she doesn't
have to be beautiful,

55
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,402
just patient.

56
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,372
Well, how about Frieda?

57
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,151
How are you, Admiral?

58
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,687
Well, hello, Nell.

59
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,722
You've been to the North Sea.

60
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,722
I sure have, and now

61
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,258
I'm on an extended
leave of absence.

62
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,657
- Well, I'm...
- Going to be here a long time.

63
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,326
Ooh, you're my kind of man.

64
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,897
I like the way

65
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,036
you move.

66
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,977
All I want to hear from you

67
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,881
is that I'm handsome,
virile, generous, and kind.

68
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,443
Waffle man, waffle man...

69
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,655
Put your money in your hand
for the waffle man

70
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,986
For the waffle man

71
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,492
The waffle man is here,
the waffle man is there

72
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,655
The waffle man is everywhere

73
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,494
Waffle man, waffle man...

74
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,483
What's the matter, Will?

75
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,784
Shh, come on, hush up.

76
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,662
You don't want to wake
everybody up.

77
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,723
Shh! Be quiet now.

78
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,697
Violet!

79
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,865
What if you had woke him up?

80
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,535
He paid for all night,
and you know what he's like.

81
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,205
Well, Will woke me up.

82
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,406
You're not supposed
to wake me up.

83
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,916
I don't get to sleep late
anymore.

84
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,620
Where'd you get those earrings?

85
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,850
They're awful pretty.

86
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,189
Never mind where I got 'em.

87
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,057
He gave 'em to me.

88
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,687
He won 'em in a card game
or something.

89
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,762
Then I won them from him.

90
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,267
Don't!

91
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,802
Just pierced them
for me last night,

92
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,132
that's how I won 'em.

93
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,732
It's a lucky thing I was drunk.

94
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,833
Will you give them
to me when I grow up?

95
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,935
Are you
out of your mind?

96
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,571
These are real emeralds.

97
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,013
Otherwise,

98
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,106
I never would have let him

99
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,616
punch those ugly holes
in my ears.

100
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,953
Get my coffee.
I feel awful.

101
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,532
Ooka, dooka, soda cracker,

102
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,335
does your father chew tobacco?

103
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,171
- Ooka...
- Violet!

104
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,308
Give me my cane.

105
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,591
Oh, my absinthe.

106
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,007
Where the hell

107
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,204
is that black bitch
with my coffee?!

108
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,811
Yes, you handle that
with care, Joe.

109
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,397
And you ought to leave off
suckling that boy.

110
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,126
You're going
to turn him spoiled,

111
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,760
just like you did with Violet.

112
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,030
Oh, I think she likes it,

113
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,470
having big tits.

114
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,389
Hey, 'Tonia, Violet,
get off that pony.

115
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,050
I got something to tell you.

116
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,149
I went to see Mama Mosebery
last night.

117
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,693
I paid her two dollars,
and she gave me some

118
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,195
uncooked turtle heart
to bring me luck

119
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,163
for the lottery,
and I swallowed it whole!

120
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,134
Where you going?

121
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,369
I ain't here, you know,
to entertain you.

122
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,807
I gots deliveries upstairs.

123
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,606
Well, how'd it taste like?

124
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,771
What taste like?

125
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,610
Raw turtle's heart!

126
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,343
What do you think
it tasted like?

127
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,942
Aw, come on, please, tell me!

128
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,592
Well, I am the child
of a snapping turtle.

129
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,389
Raised by alligators
on panther's milk.

130
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,056
I'm a poisoned wolf
from Bitter Creek,

131
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,362
and tonight's
my night to howl!

132
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,042
Peddlers use the back door.

133
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,811
...four, five, six...

134
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,287
A peddler.

135
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,517
Violet, go sit down
and finish your okra.

136
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:25,496
I'm not raising you so's
your teeth will rot, you know.

137
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,588
What is this sheet
doing here?

138
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,667
It doesn't belong to the house.

139
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,761
Six, seven, eight, nine...

140
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,205
Look what's coming.

141
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,333
...eleven.

142
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,177
Aw, hush up now, come on, baby,

143
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,977
shh, shh, shh.

144
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,651
Hi, I'm Bellocq.

145
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,058
I'm looking
for Madame Livingston.

146
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,063
Is she receiving callers?

147
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,123
Harry, get down here.

148
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,866
You may come in,
Monsieur Bellocq.

149
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,869
Well, come in then.

150
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,153
Good God, you're in
the wrong place, Monsieur.

151
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,385
We're not
in the business of buying.

152
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,054
Madame, um,
perhaps you know my name.

153
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,930
I have... photographed
in the district many times.

154
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,335
Am I addressing
Madame Livingston?

155
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,541
Yes, you are,

156
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,810
Monsieur.

157
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,982
And you are too early.

158
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,785
My girls are all asleep.

159
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,416
They work late, you know.

160
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,860
It's 10:00 in the morning,
Monsieur.

161
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,864
I require the light
from the sun.

162
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,264
Now is the best time for me.

163
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,597
This young lady there,

164
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,261
she would be fine.

165
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,798
I run a good, old-fashioned
whorehouse, Monsieur.

166
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,743
And you seem
a little rabbity to me.

167
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,974
Photographs?

168
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,709
What the hell
kind of thing is that?

169
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,950
I don't cater to the inverts.

170
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,082
If you're looking
for something different,

171
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,717
I can assure you,
you can find it

172
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,058
right down here
in New Orleans.

173
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,563
Madame, please, don't tell me

174
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,498
about New Orleans,
I've lived here all my life.

175
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,332
I apologize, Monsieur.

176
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,706
You realize I'm willing
to pay for her time.

177
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:58,810
Violet, child, go get me
that package that Red brought.

178
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,822
Would you care
for an absinthe?

179
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,326
Madame, the light.

180
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,829
I beg your pardon.

181
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,090
Oh, the light.

182
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,632
I had quite forgotten.

183
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,867
Well, go and take our Hattie.

184
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,097
She's very good, you know.

185
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,107
She will do whatever you want.

186
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,803
Thank you, ma'am.

187
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,783
And go take care
of that child for her.

188
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,321
Want me
to take my clothes off now?

189
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,453
No, no, I'm liking you
just as you are.

190
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,498
You want me like this?

191
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,761
Uncombed,
I'm not even washed.

192
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,962
Yes, yes.

193
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,544
I don't like that face.

194
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,658
It ain't a pleasant face.

195
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,161
Now this is a pleasant face.

196
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,696
Quiet!

197
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,430
I must have quiet now.

198
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,059
Go away, Violet.

199
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,129
No, it's only
she mustn’t talk to you.

200
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,901
She's very beautiful.

201
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,068
She looks very like you.

202
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,907
Yes, everybody notices it.

203
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,447
She's my sister.

204
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,483
Ma, I ain't!

205
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,277
My face is very like
my mother's,

206
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,792
but I got a fat stomach,
just like all my fathers.

207
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,394
Where the hell is that
god damn whore's ass?

208
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,595
Hattie!

209
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,549
Maybe he's a voodoo man,

210
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,108
'cause he gots them bottles
and stuff.

211
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,089
Nah, he's just
another dumb john.

212
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,717
Jesus God, woman,
get up and get me something.

213
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,316
My head is killing me.

214
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,657
I need something...
laudanum, something.

215
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,629
Jesus Christ!

216
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,666
My mama's having
her likeness made,

217
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,667
and it's all paid for, so there.

218
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,939
Why, hell, man.

219
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,203
She's only good for one thing.

220
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,676
Why would anybody want
to take a picture

221
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,770
of a piece of ass?

222
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,509
Excuse me, I will have
to ask you to move away.

223
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,052
She must remain
absolutely still.

224
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,609
Come on, Honey Pie,

225
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,416
now, go along, now.

226
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,956
You're still just
a little bit drunk.

227
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,688
Where the hell
did you get those earrings?

228
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,787
What?

229
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,630
Give me those emeralds.

230
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,672
You skull-cracking,
cotton-brained whore!

231
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,241
You gave them to me
last night!

232
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,640
Well, why would I give

233
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,735
real emeralds to a whore?

234
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,143
God damn you,

235
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,874
you bet me I wouldn't let you

236
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,540
put those holes in my ears,

237
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,585
and I did, so those are mine!

238
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,586
I won them!

239
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,288
Them's mine!

240
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,693
Oh, my sweet
little piece of ass!

241
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,097
I remember now,
Hattie, I remember.

242
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,790
Go to the bed and take off
your stockings, child.

243
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,838
Mama Mosebery,
I've got this hair growing...

244
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,140
round my nipples,
and I'm tired of plucking it.

245
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,543
Oh...

246
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,207
You must pluck 'em
on Good Friday.

247
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:36,687
Bound that same day,
and they'll never grow back.

248
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,728
Another new frock from Paris?

249
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,265
It's too early
for a piece of tail.

250
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,638
It must be the bill collector.

251
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,475
Violet, you're going to be
a lucky little one.

252
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,981
You're going to have
so many men,

253
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,484
you won't know
what to do with them.

254
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,144
No, no, please,
if-if she's busy,

255
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,151
I'll come back later.

256
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,448
- Come on.
- No, no, please.

257
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,892
- I'd rather wait downstairs.
- Come on, come on.

258
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,861
Look who I found
skulking in the hallway.

259
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,863
He say he's a photographic.

260
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,023
Hey, voodoo man,

261
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,897
I just got my fortune told, see?

262
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,034
No, no, no, no, no.

263
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,040
He says he got something
for Hattie,

264
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,871
but he won't show it to me.

265
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,844
Hattie,
you got a gentleman friend!

266
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,550
Oh, excuse me, I...

267
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,643
I didn't mean
to disturb you ladies.

268
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,382
I... I have something
for Miss Hattie.

269
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,548
She's in the bathtub.

270
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,058
She's always in the bathtub.

271
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,763
Oh, she is in-in-indisposed.

272
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,266
I-I... would rather...

273
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,268
- What's that?
- No, no, no.

274
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,031
I-I'd rather leave this off
for Miss Hattie.

275
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,198
Don't give me that.

276
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,299
You is a sport.

277
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,107
Hey... let me see your camera.

278
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,818
Don't do that.

279
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,684
Don't do that.
Stop, please.

280
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,687
Careful.

281
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,485
Oh, she's so pretty.

282
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,026
Christ be, she
looks like an angel.

283
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,356
Everybody knows
that ain't so.

284
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,158
Sure wish I had a picture
like that of myself.

285
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,027
Yeah, I could send
one home to my folks.

286
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,657
How'd you do that?

287
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,032
Nice. I want one.

288
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,195
Magic.

289
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,171
And I only need one second.

290
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,201
Well, my pretty baby

291
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,371
Won't you come on over here

292
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:48,386
Let your sweet papa
whisper in your ear

293
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,547
Well, I'm wild
about the jelly roll

294
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,125
Sweet jelly roll of mine...

295
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,093
Cheating is right.

296
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,389
You cheated me.

297
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,595
Well, there's my cards...
queens and aces.

298
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,223
Let's see yours.

299
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,235
What the hell is it?

300
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,472
Let me go!

301
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,473
I got three aces.

302
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,804
I don't know what
you've got there.

303
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:12,809
You're drunk, man.

304
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,812
Get out of my place!

305
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,848
Your place?!

306
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,281
To hell with you
and your kind!

307
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,155
And don't you know, madame,

308
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,224
that you are as common
as whale piss.

309
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,795
Oh!

310
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,864
Oh, Highpockets,
oh, what have you done to?

311
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,207
- Oh, God...
- Oh...

312
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,043
Where the hell is that bum,
Harry?

313
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,549
My God, you killed him.

314
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,710
Well, I hope so.

315
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,722
Hattie, you must take
the bitters with the sweets.

316
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,621
Lon, go back to your piano.

317
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,294
Violet, go make me a pipe.

318
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,596
I can't take
all this emotionalizing.

319
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,804
Harry, get in here

320
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,809
and throw him out.

321
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,640
You can't throw him out.

322
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:21,838
He'll come back and kill me.

323
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,540
Well, look what that goddamn,

324
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,139
son of a bitch
did to my place.

325
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,650
Well, you just can't
leave him to die.

326
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,277
Well, you just watch me.

327
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,287
Harry, go through his pockets
and take everything he's got.

328
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,202
He only has about a hundred.

329
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,206
Take it all.

330
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,039
Drop him on Emma Johnson's
doorstep.

331
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,045
Oh, no!

332
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,546
Go on then.

333
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,675
Pack up your bags
and go with him.

334
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,016
And get rid of that hammer

335
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,748
that accidentally
dropped on him.

336
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,158
We don't do no carpentry work
in here,

337
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,218
so we don't need no hammers.

338
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,980
Hattie, you know
Nell didn't mean that.

339
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,310
Something must've went wrong

340
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,317
when your ma was carrying you
in her pouch.

341
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,319
Oh, yeah, something
went wrong.

342
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,150
My mama was a whore.

343
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,883
She had me in a house
just like this.

344
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,924
Now I'm a whore,
and I don't know anything

345
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,482
except a man lying on top of me,

346
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,653
scared to death I'm going
to get the little casino.

347
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,695
Oh, here we go again.

348
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,857
You think you're
the only whore in New Orleans

349
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,194
scared of getting sick?

350
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,700
Oh, you just go
ahead and laugh.

351
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,361
You're going to end up
peddling gas

352
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,701
for a thumbnail of cocaine.

353
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,241
I'll send for my trunk.

354
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,915
Everybody has a right
to do what they want.

355
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,248
I want to be a
respectable person.

356
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,378
With a gambler?

357
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,352
It's those respectable people

358
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,024
who are lying on top of you
every night, Hattie.

359
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,328
You'll be back.

360
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,803
No, I won't!

361
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,134
I'm here for one purpose

362
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,640
and that's to live my life
to the hilt

363
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,337
and enjoy it the same way.

364
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,138
Come on, Violet.

365
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,808
Why aren't you packed?

366
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,874
I don't want to go.

367
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,984
Violet, I am your mother.

368
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:44,987
No, you're not.

369
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,217
You even say so all the time.

370
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,529
Violet, why are you acting
this way?

371
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,865
What ails you?

372
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,837
Violet?

373
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,704
Violet, I'm talking to you!

374
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,538
God, I have
a splitting headache.

375
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,785
I'm going to stay here.

376
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,748
I hate you.

377
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,291
lf... if it weren't for you,

378
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,953
I would've been out of here
a long time ago.

379
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,792
Oh, you're so selfish!
This isn't fair!

380
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,093
I... why does everybody else

381
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,794
get to do everything they want
to do around here except me

382
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,302
just when I get a...

383
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,433
a chance to do something...
for myself.

384
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,874
Sometimes I wish
I'd never been born.

385
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:19,245
The windin' boy,
don't deny my name...

386
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:27,551
The windin' boy,
don't deny my name

387
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,684
Pick it up and shake it

388
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,228
Like a stavin' chain

389
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,232
This is Josephine
who just loves universities.

390
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,794
- Hi, darlin'.
- Don't deny my name

391
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,071
Every time...

392
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,079
Actually,
my real name is Hildegarde.

393
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,446
My friends
all call me Hildegarde.

394
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,109
You from Tulane?

395
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,016
- Oh, yeah.
- I say, now, every time

396
00:30:56,087 --> 00:31:01,047
Changing of that doggone moon

397
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,150
That old moon

398
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,195
That's very brave.

399
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:10,030
Every time,
the changing of the moon

400
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:14,868
Mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm

401
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:23,074
The windin' boy,
don't deny my name.

402
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,852
You two ladies are going
to change my luck.

403
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,961
Do you think I'm pretty?

404
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,439
Yes, I certainly do.

405
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,101
And the other girls,
do you like them?

406
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,440
Well, yes.

407
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,275
Then why do you sit here
night after night?

408
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,942
Why don't you go upstairs
with any of them?

409
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,112
That is for me to know
and for you to find out.

410
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,158
You're very old, aren't you?

411
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,199
Yes, very old.

412
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,531
Very, very old?

413
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,197
Yes, very, very old.

414
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,036
Do you think
you'll be dead soon?

415
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,370
No, I don't think so.

416
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,877
Well, why don't you think so?

417
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,540
Well, I don't feel
like being dead yet.

418
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,207
I'm too young.

419
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,413
You said you're old, so
how can you be too young?

420
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,919
Got to wet my whistle.

421
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,937
Well, I think
you'll be dead soon.

422
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,530
Oh, why?

423
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,097
'Cause Madame Nell said so.

424
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,041
She said you'd be
better off dead.

425
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,045
Oh, better off dead?

426
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,307
Uh-huh.

427
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,973
Madame says there's
something wrong with you.

428
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,643
That you're some kind of
cream puff, or something.

429
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,485
She thinks that you're pathetic,
missing all the fun in life.

430
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:16,856
Perhaps Madame Nell is imagining
she knows more than she does.

431
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,361
You think she's having fun?

432
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,865
She's as happy as anybody.

433
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:31,207
Are you afraid
you'll get little casino?

434
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,867
The clap?

435
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,538
Oh. No.

436
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,410
Well, why then?

437
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,882
Do I ask you questions?

438
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,885
I don't have to explain
myself to a child.

439
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,716
I'm not a child.

440
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,221
Excuse me,
that is your opinion.

441
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,382
Leave me alone.

442
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,586
You hate me.

443
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,198
I have no time
for hate or love.

444
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,707
Dear child,
you're so full of life.

445
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,303
You don't have to take mine,

446
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,280
do you?

447
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,213
Ah-hah.

448
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,545
Well, what have we here?

449
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,881
Are you selling little girls
now, Madame Nell?

450
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,717
White slavery, huh?

451
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,224
Hey, do you know how to kiss?

452
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,590
Of course I do.
Everybody does.

453
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,220
Well, you watch out for him,
Violet.

454
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,820
He's got a heart
like an artichoke...

455
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,263
a leaf for every girl

456
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,097
and a prick on the end
of each one of them.

457
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,566
Now tell me where'd you get
those pretty pearly teeth

458
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,769
and that beautiful brown hair?

459
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,872
My mama puts my teeth in
every morning with a crocheter,

460
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,143
and I chose brown hair

461
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,309
'cause it don't show the dirt.

462
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,285
Mmm.

463
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,154
No. No, no.

464
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,289
No, no, that's-that's-that's
not my style, you know.

465
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,459
I was just kidding around.

466
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,377
What will you give me
for a message?

467
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,147
I'll give you
the back of my hand

468
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,380
is what I'll give you.

469
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,218
Is there someone
down there for me?

470
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,153
Mm-hmm.

471
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,249
It's that horrible
old coot again. Ugh.

472
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,794
Do not be so snotty
about him.

473
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,965
That old fool's idea
that he likes me,

474
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,935
is my ticket
out of this place.

475
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,937
And besides,

476
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,133
he is rich.

477
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,972
I know because I looked him up
in the phone book,

478
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,808
and he lives on St. Charles.

479
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,146
And he could have whatever
he wants in the world...

480
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,846
and he wants me...

481
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,684
...who doesn't give a damn
for him.

482
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:59,739
Me... who doesn't give a damn
for him.

483
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,718
This is my little girl,
Violet.

484
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,393
And how old are you, Violet?

485
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,791
I don't know.

486
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,124
Do you like her?

487
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,163
She is very pretty.

488
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,303
Like Nell says,
she's only for friends,

489
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,102
so she's still a virgin.

490
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,631
Well, I have it now.

491
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,935
You may relax.

492
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,978
I feel like I'm going to croak.

493
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,316
Violet, honey,
go get us a drink.

494
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,600
Before the war,

495
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,138
we used to close down
in the summertime,

496
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,333
but since the naval base came,

497
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,377
we're busy all year round now.

498
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,083
Can I buy you a drink?

499
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,416
No, thank you.

500
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,083
Perhaps we could
make another one now.

501
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,217
Would you like to?

502
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,261
Yeah, why not?

503
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,425
My breasts are very nice.

504
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:34,904
They're nicer
than any of the other girls'.

505
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,066
Do you think maybe I should just
show 'em a little bit?

506
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,336
Yes, that would be better.

507
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,843
Let me... let me see.

508
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,620
Well?

509
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,484
You have fine skin.

510
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,458
Do you have any white powder?

511
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,496
Sure, surely... right over there.

512
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,970
Put it on your shoulders here.

513
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,743
Yes, and-and on your breast.

514
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,729
I love the one you made
of Fanny naked.

515
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,767
She sure is fat.

516
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,769
Fanny's beautiful...

517
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,032
but I wasn't pleased
with the light.

518
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,769
So, you're all
ready for me now?

519
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,572
Are you content?

520
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,874
Child, I'm afraid
you'll have to go now.

521
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,919
Me?

522
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,030
Lie back against...

523
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,037
put you head here.

524
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,037
Yes, uh...

525
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,007
Can you lay on-on your side?

526
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,909
That's it.

527
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,710
And put-put your hand
behind your head.

528
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,375
That's it.

529
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,713
That's perfect.
Don't move.

530
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,754
Don't move at all.

531
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,300
You look very beautiful.

532
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,502
Just beautiful.

533
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,874
I'm very happy just now.

534
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,275
Just a few seconds, and it will
all be there perfectly.

535
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,315
Now, don't move.

536
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,719
That one should be very nice.

537
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,758
Now, don't move.

538
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,077
Never, never do that!

539
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,514
You have no idea
what you might have done!

540
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,745
I only wanted to see
the picture.

541
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,720
I didn't do anything!

542
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,766
Violet...

543
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,269
you have to wait.

544
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,932
This is only a negative.

545
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,737
It has to be developed,
and printed, and...

546
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,142
and then...

547
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,476
You love her.

548
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:07,517
Don't tell me how I feel.

549
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,820
Now, Violet...

550
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,484
I'm very sorry...

551
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,857
but you might've ruined
a whole day's work for me,

552
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,953
so you should be sorry, too.

553
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,498
Don't tell me how I feel.

554
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,158
I know about you.

555
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,270
You love her.

556
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,206
Leave her be.

557
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,505
She's just showing off.

558
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,905
Come on,
let's go down and eat.

559
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,064
I like that one better.

560
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,600
Trying to rob
a poor working girl.

561
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,466
I'll give you 25 cents
and no more.

562
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,936
I am... three each.

563
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,133
- Sell it to you for a dollar.
- A dollar?

564
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,006
I saw the same blouse
on Canal Street for 50 cents.

565
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,635
Ah.

566
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,512
Course, uh... I likes my women

567
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,677
with a little more
on the top and bottom.

568
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,483
Stop being so cheeky with me,
or I'll get my voodoo woman

569
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,149
to put gris gris
all over your piano.

570
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,657
Violet, come on down here,

571
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,853
and let me see
the front of that dress.

572
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,857
Oh, Violet,
that ain't much of a dress.

573
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,525
When you're going to bust
your cherry,

574
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,035
you best wear red satin.

575
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,695
That's why
you're a dumb nigger...

576
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:35,864
'cause you think like that.

577
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,031
She's a virgin.

578
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,199
Do you want her to be dressed

579
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,275
like a Picayune whore?

580
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,208
My God, Frieda,
you're as green as a goose turd.

581
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,457
What's this?

582
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,086
Open it and see.

583
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,890
It's the ninth bone

584
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,589
from the tail
of a black cat...

585
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,566
guaranteed to bring you luck
tonight.

586
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,630
Red Top!

587
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,730
Do not forget

588
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,502
that this guy's
buying a virgin,

589
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,133
so she's got to act it right.

590
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,837
You've got to give him
the idea

591
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,675
that you don't know nothing.

592
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,044
Should be like a rape.

593
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,082
You don't know.

594
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,639
Could be a different kind
of guy...

595
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,516
someone that wants you to act
like she wants it.

596
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,919
The main thing is
to whimper and cry

597
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,684
at first when he starts,

598
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,658
but then you've got to
act like it feels good.

599
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,023
I know what to do.

600
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,427
Leave me alone.

601
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,987
Well, don't act
like you know it all.

602
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,033
You won't even get a tip
that way.

603
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,899
Violet, you should
touch him... there...

604
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,200
you know... like it's accidental.

605
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,433
I know... I know all that.

606
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,874
Violet, you is
a beautiful girl.

607
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:50,107
Now, all you need
is that handsome dress

608
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,149
and plenty diamonds
to elaborate the condition.

609
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,220
That was good.

610
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,121
You better enjoy it.

611
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,626
It's the last fine dinner
you'll get on me.

612
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,753
- Oh, hell, no.
- No, no, no.

613
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:08,798
Isn't that so, Senator?

614
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,767
The Navy's going to close
the district down.

615
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:16,636
Well, I can't fight
the United States Navy.

616
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:20,666
We tried that already,
and we lost.

617
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,198
Sit down, Violet, it's easier.

618
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,043
Honey, you want me to help you

619
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,170
put your powder on, or anything?

620
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,679
No, I can do it myself.

621
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,045
All right.

622
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,056
God, I could remember
when she was born,

623
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,523
and now she's busting
her cherry.

624
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,719
Jesus, Fanny, you were
only six years old

625
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,126
when she was born.

626
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,142
My, my, aren't you handsome?

627
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,408
Why haven't
you been here before?

628
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,540
You're just my kind of man.

629
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,384
Oh, look at that.

630
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,356
Where you been hiding
that thing?

631
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:47,462
How long has it been
for you, Cherie?

632
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,828
Lie down right here.

633
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,196
Give it to me, baby.

634
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,186
A virgin, bona fide.

635
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,317
How old is she?

636
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,417
Do you want to put me in jail?

637
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,222
She's just old enough.

638
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,004
The finest delicacy
New Orleans has to offer,

639
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,671
and it's her wish

640
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,148
that one of you gentlemen
be the first.

641
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,017
If you'll all join me

642
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,118
in the parlor,
you'll get your opportunity.

643
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,958
Come on, quick.

644
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,766
Give me the ribbon, child.

645
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,142
Come on.

646
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,758
What am I bid, gentlemen?

647
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:24,226
Don't we get a look
before we buy?

648
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,522
Kent, you can look

649
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:26,619
all you want.

650
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,426
Just don't break
the merchandise.

651
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,736
Hey, how do we know
she is a virgin?

652
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,363
Have I ever lied

653
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,634
to you before?

654
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,699
Satisfaction guaranteed.

655
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:55,181
Well, gentlemen,
I'm getting impatient.

656
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,086
I'll bid a hundred dollars.

657
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,062
Yeah!

658
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,829
I'm bidding $120.

659
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,496
$150.

660
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,666
Oh, well, now.

661
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,471
$50!

662
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,306
Beautiful, Senator,
just beautiful.

663
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,873
Remember, gentlemen,
she's as fresh

664
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,578
as a baby's lips.

665
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:23,676
$160.

666
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,812
$165.

667
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:25,945
$175.

668
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,786
$180.

669
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,348
Getting out of my reach.

670
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,393
$200.

671
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:36,231
Gentlemen, gentlemen... $210.

672
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:40,565
I'll top that with $225.

673
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,504
Well, I'll bid $230.

674
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,803
All right, $240.

675
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,276
$250.

676
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,508
$275, madame.

677
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:54,507
$280.

678
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,290
$300.

679
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,780
Will you take a check?

680
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,519
What would I do with a check?

681
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,156
Cash.

682
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,290
I got cash. $400.

683
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,994
Jesus Christ, who is he,
Rockefeller?

684
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,871
Hey, this is kind of
out of our league.

685
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,200
We don't have
that kind of money.

686
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,208
Look, this is our night.

687
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,174
You weren't invited here.

688
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,041
Who do you think you are?

689
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,047
Hey, watch what you're doing!

690
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,174
Watch out, fellas.

691
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,217
Sold to the man

692
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,818
with 400 cash.

693
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,158
Do not give him any argument.

694
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,432
You want some whiskey?

695
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,848
Well, Jesus, I didn't mean
the whole damn thing.

696
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,182
I'm glad it's you.

697
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,592
Why are you glad it's me?

698
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:52,067
Well... you look nice, and...
you have a nice chest.

699
00:52:55,372 --> 00:53:00,002
I can feel the steam inside me
right through my dress.

700
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,894
Let him have his young peach.

701
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,384
I like my fruit ripe, eh?

702
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:27,259
Gives me queasy innards
to see a thing like that.

703
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,929
Isn't there a lock?

704
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:58,434
Madame Nell don't allow
no locks.

705
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,436
God damn, for $400,

706
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,472
I'd like to have
that door locked.

707
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,143
I hope you're going to be
real gentle on me,

708
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:20,019
being my first time.

709
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,183
Want a whiskey?

710
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,362
Please...

711
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,480
You want to go for
a little roll in the kip?

712
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,532
Are you sure
you don't want to go

713
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,433
for a little roll in the kip?

714
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,972
It smells bad in here.

715
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,210
You're feeling badly?

716
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,303
Oh, I feel fine.

717
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,178
I feel all right.

718
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,080
I'm happy.

719
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,812
I feel fine,

720
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,956
and I could probably
accommodate personally

721
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,720
every man of the house
if I decided to.

722
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,519
Violet?

723
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,157
Jesus.

724
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,564
Madame?!

725
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,035
Violet?

726
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,196
Get a doctor!

727
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,466
She's been murdered!

728
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,203
Violet? Oh, my baby!

729
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:57,405
Violet?

730
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,779
Baby?

731
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,259
Well, I'd like to know
where the hell y'all been?

732
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,817
I been lying here forever.

733
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,087
Oh...

734
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,629
You don't care about me at all.

735
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,391
Oh, Violet, that
really wasn't funny.

736
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,132
I know it's not funny.

737
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,298
Am I laughing?

738
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,501
So, you had a live one, huh?

739
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,979
Come on,
that's what it's all about.

740
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,676
Maybe now you'll let us sleep
in the morning

741
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,775
when we feel bad.

742
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:52,898
The war, father got killed,
mother forced to go to work.

743
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,664
You know, she's a virgin.

744
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,171
Oh, I ain't too particular
about the virgin part,

745
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,834
but I hear tell
there's disease.

746
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,003
I got no sick girls here,
monsieur.

747
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,877
Who told you about my place,
a friend?

748
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,314
Yes'm.

749
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,851
Well, if you can't trust
a friend...

750
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,695
Now, how about it?

751
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:23,823
Pure

752
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,027
as the driven snow.

753
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,146
Can I have a little bit of wine?

754
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,148
Thank you.

755
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,276
You spoil me.

756
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,482
Oh, my gosh.

757
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,525
That took my breath away.

758
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,057
There are only two things
to do on rainy days,

759
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,031
and I don't like
to play cards.

760
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:01,829
I propose a toast.

761
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:02,929
Oh.

762
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,371
To a quick end of the war.

763
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:06,934
Yeah.

764
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,944
To the end of the war.

765
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,816
A bird.

766
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,517
Catch it.

767
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,822
- Get it!
- Oh!

768
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,555
Oh, wow.

769
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,927
It's bad luck.
It means death.

770
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,124
Open the damn windows.

771
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,257
It'll fly out.

772
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,562
No. It has to go out
the same way it came in.

773
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,797
Oh, I better get
that little bird.

774
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,134
Come down here!

775
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,332
Come down... you...

776
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,243
Ain't it pretty?

777
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,754
It's so tiny.

778
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:04,759
Love

779
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,698
Oh, love

780
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,031
Oh, careless love

781
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,196
Come on, honey.

782
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,705
Don't be shy.

783
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,865
Please?

784
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:16,105
Won't you see
what careless love will do?

785
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,012
Now. Tell 'em for me now,
please.

786
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,447
Shh! Shh! Shh!

787
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:22,541
Well, uh...

788
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,452
I've asked Hattie to be my wife,

789
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:29,389
and she has personally agreed,
so we're going to be married.

790
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,222
Oh, that's great.

791
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,589
We're going to have a wedding.

792
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,392
When? 'Cause we are ready.

793
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,234
Well, actually,

794
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,303
we're-we're going to get married
in his hometown.

795
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,005
Yeah, you see, I, um...
I got me this little house

796
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,271
in St. Louis, Missouri,
so, uh...

797
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:51,074
I kind of thought
we'd be married there.

798
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,914
Well, Hattie,
you finally nailed one, huh?

799
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,652
Aren't you going to answer me,
Violet?

800
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,395
I had to do it this way.

801
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,801
I wasn't even sure
he really meant it

802
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,142
until he come today.

803
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,811
But he's got the ring
and everything.

804
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,876
It's going to be
really big things for us.

805
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,751
I told him that
you was my sister.

806
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,828
He don't know any different.

807
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,193
As soon as the
right time comes,

808
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,390
I'm going to tell him.

809
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:43,693
It's lucky
he doesn't even mind

810
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,166
about Little Will.

811
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,871
Want some?

812
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,370
Hattie, our-our train leaves
in a half an hour.

813
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,042
All right, honey.

814
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,109
I'm coming.

815
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,857
Auf Wiedersehen.

816
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:14,685
Honey, I'll send for you.

817
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,890
I promise you that.

818
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,933
Oh.

819
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,893
Do I look all right?

820
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,360
One card.

821
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,487
One card, Al.

822
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,531
Don't you fellows want
to do something?

823
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,998
It's our day off.

824
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,500
Well, we are doing something.

825
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:53,899
I tell you,

826
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,835
you put men in a room
with a bunch of whores,

827
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,896
and all they want to do
is play poker.

828
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,271
Never understand men.

829
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,900
Yeah, really.

830
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,946
Well, we still have Papa.

831
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,776
Shall I take you all
to the burlesque?

832
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,677
Or we could go
to the picture show.

833
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,720
I know.
Let's play Sardines.

834
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

835
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,445
And Papa... Papa can be it.

836
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,156
I don't know this game,
Sardines.

837
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,157
I never heard of it.

838
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,420
- You'll learn.
- You'll find out.

839
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:20,462
We made it up.

840
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,462
It's really a lot of fun.

841
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,464
Well, how do you play?

842
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,696
One, two,

843
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:33,071
three, four,

844
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,370
five,

845
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:37,776
six, seven,

846
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,372
eight, nine,

847
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,849
ten!

848
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,217
Look under the bed.

849
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,759
Okay.

850
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,887
He's not in Agnes' room.

851
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:56,322
Papa!

852
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,831
Goddamn it.

853
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,094
Did you find him?

854
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,236
Papa?

855
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:09,540
I know you're in here.

856
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:14,640
We'll just have
to fly south. See?

857
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,580
I didn't look
in Gussie's room.

858
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,088
Damn it!

859
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,024
You're easy.

860
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,094
I heard you breathing.

861
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,365
Oh!

862
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,539
Did you like that?

863
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,283
Come on.

864
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,194
Hey.

865
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,286
He's been real bad.

866
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,761
It's been hard
to keep him quiet.

867
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,855
Get in, get in.

868
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,158
Sardine. Uh-uh.

869
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,599
Caught your sardine!

870
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,067
What's under there?

871
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,336
Bet they're ain't
no cream puffs!

872
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:49,769
All right.

873
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,676
Whoo!

874
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,012
It's just a trick.

875
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,552
She hates to be losing a game.

876
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,883
God, there sure was a fall.

877
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:06,162
Funny, I think
I broke something.

878
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,356
You broke something,

879
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,487
all right.

880
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,301
I love you once,

881
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,964
I love you twice.
I love you

882
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,905
more than beans and rice.

883
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:27,808
What did he say?

884
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,214
Come on.

885
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,312
Mademoiselle
from Armentières

886
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,014
Parlez-vous

887
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:34,989
Mademoiselle
from Armentieres

888
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,615
Parlez-vous

889
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,717
The officers
get all the take

890
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,455
And all I get is a bellyache

891
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:43,999
Inky-dinky parlez-vous.

892
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,139
How about a little something
for the professor?

893
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,386
What will become of her now?

894
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,388
What's going on with you?

895
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,424
You don't have
to worry about her.

896
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,551
She's made a lot of money.

897
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,493
She can do as she likes.

898
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,073
She's-she's only 12.

899
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,133
She's completely alone.

900
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,149
Bellocq,
you're in love with her.

901
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:41,348
Don't be absurd.

902
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:45,451
I've seen it a hundred times.

903
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,496
I am old.

904
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,997
And life is so long.

905
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,712
Oh, yeah, I love you,
little woman

906
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,613
She's my baby

907
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,651
My joy
and little woman

908
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,242
I love her...

909
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,412
She's crazy little...

910
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,854
Stop that goo-gooing.

911
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,225
Thank you, thank you. I...

912
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,668
You're quite welcome.

913
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,103
I knew you needed it.

914
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:32,800
Five.
What did I roll?

915
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:33,967
- Eight.
- Eight.

916
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,135
Thank you.

917
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,143
You're welcome.

918
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,144
I got an eight.

919
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,271
Yeah, you got an eight.

920
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:39,279
I'm winning.

921
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,484
Very good.

922
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,076
Five.

923
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:47,352
Nine.

924
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,886
Go ahead.

925
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,425
I'm standing here
thinking I'm ready

926
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,621
to get my picture took.

927
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,163
Violet, please go away.

928
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:57,198
Go away, Violet.

929
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,596
I got a five.

930
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,667
I won.

931
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,501
You're stupid and old.

932
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,323
Red Top...

933
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:34,969
...when you grow up, and you
have a beard and a mustache,

934
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:38,302
I'm going to think
you're very handsome.

935
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,541
And I'm going to love you up
hard and long.

936
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,837
Well, especially me,

937
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,850
'cause I am the lover boy.

938
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,053
I bet neither of you
never done nothing.

939
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,249
Huh?

940
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,622
I had me a piece of tail
yesterday.

941
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,253
All the girls in the district
give me free lovin'.

942
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,796
Yeah.

943
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:04,991
Nonny, you never did it,
did you?

944
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,158
Of course I have.

945
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,461
Lots of times.

946
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,901
Then tell me what
it feels like.

947
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,639
Well, it feels good.

948
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,765
For God sakes,

949
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,034
what else?

950
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,336
Tell me exactly how it feels.

951
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,036
I knows how it feels,

952
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:21,378
but-but I just don't know
how to describe it.

953
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,941
It's like you get this tingling
feeling along on your back,

954
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:26,078
and this funny feeling starts
creeping up your toes.

955
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,718
Do it, Nonny.

956
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:30,883
What?

957
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,222
You must be crazy.

958
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,129
Do it to me right now.

959
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,596
Prove you can.

960
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,224
I'm big, you're little, huh?

961
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:40,597
Get off me.

962
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,775
I'm going to make you
my lover man, Nonny.

963
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,073
I'm going to love you up
real hard and long.

964
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,511
Let me up!
Let me up!

965
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,743
What you gonna say, boy?

966
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,287
Nothing.

967
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,048
He ain't gonna say nothing.

968
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,557
Violet, baby...
you is very bold,

969
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,116
and the way you been raised,

970
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,958
you don't know nothing
about real world.

971
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,157
White and colored...
they can't be together,

972
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:11,665
as far as that's concerned.

973
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,963
I can do what I want.

974
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,096
Everybody does that
with everybody.

975
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,332
And colored?

976
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:21,069
Did you see colored men upstairs
for that?

977
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,872
No, you don't, Violet.

978
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:27,211
I'm a church-going woman
that was married by a preacher,

979
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,910
and what I can say

980
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:32,147
is you've gots to leave
my Nonny alone.

981
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,884
You pushing far, Violet.

982
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,483
She certainly is.

983
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,528
Harry!

984
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:46,394
Oh! Let me... go!

985
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,938
Let me go!

986
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,975
No! I want...

987
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:56,011
Oh, let me go!

988
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,374
No!

989
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,246
Ow!

990
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,144
You can't beat a child.

991
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:07,812
It only teaches her
to beat others.

992
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,451
I'll run my business,
and you tend to yours, Papa.

993
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,229
It didn't hurt.

994
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,575
Hard headed and hard-assed.

995
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,750
Hey, Papa, you sure
you won't stay for dinner?

996
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,763
No, no, thank you.

997
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,685
And how did you find me?

998
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,744
I looked you up
in a telephone book.

999
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,722
Anybody can think of that.

1000
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,758
I don't have a telephone,
Violet.

1001
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,162
Well, I followed you here...

1002
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,198
lots of times.

1003
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,201
Have you had your supper?

1004
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,865
What's all this?

1005
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,568
I've been working.

1006
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,174
You mean, this is your work...
photographing?

1007
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:49,081
Yes. This is how
I earn my living.

1008
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,119
God, that's so easy.

1009
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,917
Well, easier
than working in a house.

1010
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,496
You've decided to run away.

1011
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,826
Where do you sleep?

1012
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,128
Upstairs.

1013
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,499
I want to see it.

1014
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:22,714
Why do you lock it?

1015
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:24,979
I don't know... habit.

1016
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,749
Sometimes children
break into my house.

1017
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,518
Why?

1018
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,616
I imagine they're curious
about me and my camera.

1019
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,991
The neighborhood has turned bad.

1020
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,860
Why?

1021
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,331
Why, why, why.
I don't know why.

1022
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,369
'Cause of the whorehouses.

1023
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,770
How come you ain't
got no electricity?

1024
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,888
Well, I like this room.

1025
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:03,117
Ooka, dooka...

1026
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,461
Well, you certainly did it,
didn't you?

1027
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,465
Violet?

1028
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:17,467
Can I stay here?

1029
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,099
Yes, you may, if you want to.

1030
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,767
I do! Will you sleep with me

1031
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,003
and take care of me?

1032
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,171
No.

1033
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,478
And why not?

1034
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,144
Because...

1035
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:32,584
'cause I'm not
sure why, exactly.

1036
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,485
Uh-huh. You're afraid of me.

1037
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,586
- Perhaps.
- I want you

1038
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:39,991
to be my lover,

1039
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,154
and buy me stockings,
and clothes, and...

1040
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,698
You don't know what
you're saying, Violet.

1041
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,461
I won't even charge you
anything at all,

1042
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:47,866
and you can visit me
at my house

1043
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,200
and be my fancy man.

1044
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,036
I thought you were running away
from the house.

1045
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,200
Oh, yes.

1046
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,210
They can't beat me like that...

1047
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,711
well, not me.

1048
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,804
I agree absolutely.

1049
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:00,905
You do?

1050
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:02,917
Otherwise I should already
have beaten you

1051
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,509
for breaking my bed.

1052
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:05,883
You hit me once.

1053
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,615
Yes, and I'm sorry.

1054
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:10,988
You love my mother
more than me.

1055
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:13,755
I know about those
things better than you.

1056
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,523
You always know those
things about men

1057
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,724
when you're a woman.

1058
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,466
Some men are different.

1059
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,505
I'm different.

1060
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,843
Well...

1061
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,513
...maybe not after all,
because...

1062
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,447
I'm all yours, Violet.

1063
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,484
All mine?

1064
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,525
Yes.

1065
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,533
I love you once,
I love you twice,

1066
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:55,729
I love you more
than beans and rice.

1067
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:06,403
I'm going to make
you so happy.

1068
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,210
You're just my kind of man.

1069
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,217
You really are.

1070
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,014
I'm really good,
you know, Cherie.

1071
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,748
Don't talk to me
like that, please.

1072
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,915
Don't talk like a whore.

1073
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,425
And what do you want me
to say?

1074
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,087
I feel something inside me,
so I say it,

1075
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,256
and when you go away,
it hurts me...

1076
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,299
right here.

1077
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,799
You're only hungry, perhaps.

1078
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,804
And what's wrong
with whores anyhow?

1079
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,840
I thought you liked us.

1080
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,480
Everybody says I'm pretty.

1081
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,142
I'm getting to be
filled out soon...

1082
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,811
and all the other men like me.

1083
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,854
Don't you like me?

1084
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:41,261
You left me all alone.

1085
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:43,263
I left you a note.

1086
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,891
Well, I can't read yet.

1087
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,263
I brought you a present.

1088
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,303
A present? Where?

1089
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,278
Ugh!

1090
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,246
Where is it?

1091
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,856
She's beautiful.

1092
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,700
Why did you buy me a doll?

1093
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,862
Every child should have a doll.

1094
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,872
I'm a child to you?

1095
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,069
Violet.

1096
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:03,000
Come out and play with me.

1097
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,235
Violet!

1098
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,280
Violet?

1099
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,263
Oh.

1100
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,173
Violet, what ails you?

1101
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,545
What's the matter, Violet?

1102
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,584
Violet, I'm talking to you.

1103
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,353
I've got such
a splittin' headache.

1104
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,553
You're so selfish, Violet.

1105
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:27,495
It's just not fair.

1106
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:30,464
People get to do
what they want except me.

1107
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,532
Violet, did you
take those bottles

1108
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:38,799
that I left on the table
in the front room?

1109
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:40,204
The ones
with the glass stoppers?

1110
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,799
Yes.

1111
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,207
Yes. I was playing
with them.

1112
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,370
Well, what did you do

1113
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,209
with what was inside of them?

1114
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,044
Well, I poured it out.

1115
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,141
My God, Violet,
that's silver nitrate.

1116
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,345
I use it for my photographs.

1117
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,388
Whatever made you do
such a thing?

1118
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:57,516
Well, it smelled so bad.

1119
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,029
Because of your
thoughtlessness,

1120
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,327
I have to go
all the way uptown

1121
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,958
to replace those chemicals.

1122
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:09,036
And they're very expensive.

1123
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:29,012
Why are you crying?

1124
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,895
For joy.

1125
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,658
And to amuse myself.

1126
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:39,190
You want to come with me?

1127
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,562
No!

1128
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,361
What are those?

1129
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,487
What are what?

1130
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,689
Those clothes.

1131
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:11,526
Oh, these?

1132
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:12,930
These are pajamas.

1133
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,333
You aren't going to tell me

1134
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:18,338
you've never in your life
seen pajamas?

1135
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:20,737
No john I ever saw
wore anything like that.

1136
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,366
I'm tired of lying here.

1137
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:22,801
If you would have stayed quiet
for one second more,

1138
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:23,802
I would have had it.

1139
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:24,963
It's always one second more

1140
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:26,404
with you,
and why do you want

1141
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,339
to take my picture
again and again and again?

1142
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:29,433
I'm tired of having

1143
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,478
to deal with a child.

1144
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:33,773
I don't have

1145
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:35,748
to stay here
and listen to you yell at me.

1146
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:40,150
Well, I'm leaving.

1147
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,450
And you won't have anyone
to photograph anymore.

1148
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,419
So this is how
you would repay me?

1149
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,959
Repay you for what?

1150
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,084
For what?

1151
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:22,196
I don't owe you
anything at all.

1152
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:23,355
Get out!

1153
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,398
Get out, Violet,
before I kill you.

1154
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,400
If you destroy any more
of my pictures.

1155
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:28,628
Who cares about your pictures?

1156
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,829
Who buys them?
No one.

1157
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:54,293
Repent, sinners.

1158
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:55,453
Sinners!

1159
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:57,588
Pray! Pray!

1160
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:06,300
These freaking pest holes
are inhabited by 1,500 angels

1161
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,308
of death and damnation.

1162
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,607
Four hags
in palatial palaces of guilt

1163
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,647
imperil the virtue
of every innocent girl.

1164
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:21,512
And what, dearly beloved,
can we do about the weakness

1165
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:25,526
of lusting men and soft women?

1166
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:27,919
Corrupting...

1167
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,496
Violet, where you been?

1168
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:30,656
We better get out of here.

1169
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:33,199
If they catch us, we'll go
to the Home for Good Shepherds.

1170
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:36,498
Brothers and sisters, unite!

1171
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,765
Stupid puritans.

1172
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:43,276
Nell says it's just horny men
who come around to snoop.

1173
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,006
Well, this time,
they're really going to do it.

1174
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,138
Mama Mosebery says

1175
01:29:47,248 --> 01:29:48,977
everything will be closed down.

1176
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,540
So what if they do?

1177
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:51,915
I don't know.

1178
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:54,079
What'll become of me?

1179
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,282
You can be my fancy man.

1180
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,217
She's gone mad.

1181
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:27,652
I told you.

1182
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,883
Even Madame Nell.

1183
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:37,223
The evil eye is on us all.

1184
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:38,696
Look.

1185
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,099
Circles of salt.

1186
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,195
Somebody put a spell on you.

1187
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:53,804
Ola Mae, take this holy water

1188
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,145
and wash the kitchen
and Miss Nell's room.

1189
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:42,052
In Rome...

1190
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:46,225
times like these...

1191
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,268
barbarians came.

1192
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,203
Oh, did they.

1193
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:53,968
It goes on

1194
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:56,305
and on.

1195
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,485
I heard the doorbell.

1196
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:11,548
Where is everybody?

1197
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,356
Death is keeping them away.

1198
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:18,163
There are reasons for death.

1199
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:20,200
Good reasons.

1200
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,702
Oh, stop talking.

1201
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:25,432
Would you... stop it?

1202
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:27,474
Excuse me.

1203
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:32,505
Dirty roughnecks
with their rotten manners.

1204
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:41,922
Dirty roughnecks with
their rotten manners.

1205
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,414
We'll be at the station
for an hour,

1206
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:09,676
if you change your mind.

1207
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,910
Bye.

1208
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:12,213
Come on, Joanie, let's go.

1209
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:18,148
Terrible piano anyhow.

1210
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:21,058
Oh, you look so fine.

1211
01:33:21,162 --> 01:33:24,398
Violet, old gal,
we'll go to Chicago.

1212
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:27,856
Chicago is the money town.

1213
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:30,403
Oh, we'll have ourselves
a time there.

1214
01:33:30,471 --> 01:33:33,201
Take the northbound
New Orleans Central.

1215
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,174
Hey.

1216
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:41,108
Careful now.

1217
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,241
These are delicate things.

1218
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,230
Where are you going, Violet?

1219
01:33:58,332 --> 01:34:01,597
Where's that no-good mother
of yours?

1220
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:04,433
I gots a postcard from her,
and a letter.

1221
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:07,497
With no return address, huh?

1222
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,133
Don't talk about her.

1223
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:11,541
Aw, you're breakin' my heart.

1224
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:28,653
Papa, what are you doing here?

1225
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,157
I'm going to marry you.

1226
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:35,652
Can I ask all the girls?

1227
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,890
But Antonia and Justine
have gone,

1228
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,159
and-and Odette and Josephine.

1229
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:41,199
Can we go get them?

1230
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:42,200
Of course.

1231
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,203
Well, what'll I wear?

1232
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:46,432
You can wear whatever
your heart desires,

1233
01:35:46,507 --> 01:35:49,101
just as long as
you do it with me.

1234
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:01,753
Her father unknown,

1235
01:36:01,822 --> 01:36:04,290
and the mother
deserted the child.

1236
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:06,189
My mama's name
was Hildegarde,

1237
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,627
Hildegarde Marr... M-A-R-R.

1238
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:17,332
And she was Caucasian or other?

1239
01:36:17,404 --> 01:36:18,837
She was a whore, Father.

1240
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:26,907
Those whom God has united,
let no man put asunder.

1241
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:31,247
<i>In nomine patri et filii</i>
<i>et spritus sanctus.</i>

1242
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:33,878
You may kiss the bride.

1243
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:36,684
Oh, where have you been,
Billy Boy, Billy Boy?

1244
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:40,454
Oh, where have you been,
charming Billy?

1245
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:44,259
Oh, I've been to see my wife,
she's the darling of my life

1246
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:48,131
She's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother

1247
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:52,070
Can she bake a cherry pie,
Billy Boy, Billy Boy?

1248
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:55,802
Can she bake a cherry pie,
charming Billy?

1249
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:59,573
She can bake a cherry pie
quick as you can wink your eye

1250
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,241
She's a young thing
and cannot leave her mother.

1251
01:37:04,685 --> 01:37:07,950
Papa, there's a good spot
over there... pull over.

1252
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:09,990
Hell, no, turn around, Papa.

1253
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:11,388
The other place was better.

1254
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,722
No! Come on... over here!

1255
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:15,659
Sit down!

1256
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,301
Well...

1257
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:33,008
We'll just have
to get out and push.

1258
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:39,683
But I am wearing my new dress
for Chicago.

1259
01:37:39,753 --> 01:37:42,278
We're all wearing
our new dresses, you damn fool.

1260
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,517
Well, let's get
our damn clothes off

1261
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:46,059
and celebrate this thing.

1262
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:13,481
Pass me some more oysters.

1263
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,078
Anyone want some of this sauce?

1264
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,087
Oh, yeah.

1265
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:20,991
Try this, Odette.

1266
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,063
Papa, come eat.

1267
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:25,122
Yes, I'm coming.

1268
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:55,518
Ooh, look at that one!

1269
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:12,902
Papa, you didn't
eat anything before.

1270
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,975
Now, eat.

1271
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:27,318
How come one man
got so many women?

1272
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:29,856
He just got married today.

1273
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:32,357
And guess who he married?

1274
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:33,723
Guess?

1275
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:34,953
Well, it doesn't matter,

1276
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,963
'cause he's the luckiest
son of a bitch

1277
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,396
I ever seen on a wedding day.

1278
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:52,661
Why are you ringing?

1279
01:41:52,806 --> 01:41:54,398
You have everything you need.

1280
01:41:54,475 --> 01:41:57,535
I want some hot chocolate
with brandy in it.

1281
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:59,704
I feel poorly today.

1282
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,372
Oh, I'm sorry.

1283
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,075
What is it this time?

1284
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,845
Oh, you know.

1285
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:06,385
Oh, yes, of course.

1286
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:08,011
I forgot.

1287
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:11,455
I'm going to sleep
all day today.

1288
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:15,052
Well, how is that any different
from the last two weeks?

1289
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:20,156
Get me some cocoa.

1290
01:42:20,267 --> 01:42:22,963
And the bottle of brandy.

1291
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:32,503
Do you... I mean,
did the girls teach you...

1292
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:37,312
how to prevent yourself
from... becoming with child?

1293
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:38,976
I mean,
did you know you can?

1294
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:40,815
Don't tell me about that.

1295
01:42:40,888 --> 01:42:42,879
Don't tell me
about the things I know.

1296
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:51,220
Hard-headed bird
don't make good soup.

1297
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,765
That's what Ola Mae
used to say about me.

1298
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,768
I know.

1299
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,478
Violet?

1300
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:15,715
Mama?

1301
01:43:15,789 --> 01:43:17,484
Yes, it's Mama!

1302
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:21,085
Oh, Violet, my baby, my darling!

1303
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:25,892
Look at the way you've grown.

1304
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:28,559
We have been looking
everywhere for you.

1305
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:35,300
Here we go.

1306
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,342
I told him
all about you, Violet,

1307
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:46,113
and he insisted that
we come and get you.

1308
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:51,482
You smell good, Mama.

1309
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:56,023
We've got a big, beautiful house
in St. Louis.

1310
01:43:56,129 --> 01:43:58,563
Mr. Fuller,
he's a pavement contractor.

1311
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:01,567
You know, he's paved almost
every street in St. Louis.

1312
01:44:01,668 --> 01:44:05,798
And he wants you
to come home with us.

1313
01:44:05,872 --> 01:44:07,840
But I live here.

1314
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:12,139
I and Papa,
Papa and I are married now.

1315
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:15,340
Mrs. Fuller,
I'm so glad to see

1316
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:17,144
you are doing so well.

1317
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:19,879
And little Will.

1318
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:26,256
Mr. Fuller and I want nothing
to do with you, Mr. Bellocq.

1319
01:44:26,326 --> 01:44:28,157
We had to go
to some-some awful places

1320
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:31,198
to find out about you
and my daughter.

1321
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:34,133
Hattie, we're married now,
so stop this.

1322
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:36,169
It is not legal
without my consent.

1323
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,636
Mr. Fuller has
already seen to that.

1324
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:40,730
You deserted the child.

1325
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:42,206
I don't mean
to be cruel, but...

1326
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,141
- How dare you say that?!
- Now, Mr. Bellocq,

1327
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:45,473
be sensible.

1328
01:44:45,545 --> 01:44:47,775
Now, I want
to send Violet to school,

1329
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:51,784
and she has to be...
raised right.

1330
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:55,583
Now, I know
that in a lot of ways

1331
01:44:55,656 --> 01:44:58,989
we've got no right
to get up on a high horse.

1332
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:01,994
But now, Mrs. Fuller
has overcome her past,

1333
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:04,724
and she wants the same
for Violet.

1334
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:10,802
Well, you cannot take her!

1335
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:21,738
I can't live without her...
that's all.

1336
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:27,351
Papa, you can come with us.

1337
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:40,056
Come on, Violet.

1338
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,361
You don't need to pack.

1339
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:43,164
We'll get you whatever you need
on Canal Street

1340
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,636
while we're waiting
for the train.

1341
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:53,142
Can't we all go?

1342
01:47:13,493 --> 01:47:15,188
You ready?

1343
01:47:15,662 --> 01:47:17,755
Uh-huh. Just a minute.

1344
01:47:17,864 --> 01:47:19,627
There, now, that's better.

1345
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:21,758
Now we're ready.

1346
01:47:21,868 --> 01:47:23,631
Come on, look at Papa.

1347
01:47:23,703 --> 01:47:26,729
Okay, move in closer.

1348
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,603
Good.

1349
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:30,973
Now let's get one more.

1350
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:33,476
Okay.

1351
01:47:35,849 --> 01:47:37,783
What's the matter, honey?

1352
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:39,113
Is he okay?

1353
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:40,118
No, he's fine.

1354
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:41,484
Do you wanna take any more?
