1
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:05,932
Damn it! Oh!

2
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,375
Jeez...

3
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:34,892
I can't stand it! Help me! Help me!

4
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,500
God damn!

5
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,414
God damn!

6
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,214
It's wanting out, honey.

7
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:52,459
Push so we can see
what's coming out of the pouch.

8
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,418
Head's out, almost.

9
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,059
God damn!

10
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,219
Oh, God.

11
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:33,253
Come on. Oh, come on.

12
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,214
- Don't worry, baby. I'll get somebody.
- Mama had the baby!

13
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,460
Come on, Josephine.
He wants two of us.

14
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,859
I can't. I'm busy. Get Agnes.

15
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:58,131
- Mama had the baby. It's a boy!
- A boy?

16
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,581
God damn! I lost my bet.

17
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:04,659
Listen, I've already paid for two.
I'm ready now.

18
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:08,217
Sure you are, sweetie,
and we're gonna get someone nice.

19
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:12,095
Violet! 'Cause we're gonna
have ourselves a time.

20
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,054
Go and fetch Agnes yonder,
will you, baby?

21
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:15,580
Tell her to haul it up to the blue room.

22
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:18,169
We're gonna have ourselves a time.

23
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:22,334
It's a boy.

24
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:28,854
It's a boy.

25
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:45,139
Well, Violet, old girl,
is it all over upstairs?

26
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:48,571
- A boy.
- A boy?

27
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,209
Does it really hurt to have a baby?

28
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:07,051
Violet, you asking the wrongest person,
the very wrongest person in the world.

29
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,972
Come on and play that thing, Professor.

30
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:13,819
Well, I certainly will do that.

31
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:16,580
I'll play something for that pretty baby
your mama just had,

32
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:21,252
brung into this cruel, cruel world
on a night like this against his will.

33
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,298
And today I have attained
my 75th birthday,

34
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,652
and I intend to celebrate.

35
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,453
I haven't had a woman
in longer than I care to say.

36
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,300
You know,
she doesn't have to be beautiful,

37
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,740
just patient.

38
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:57,056
Well, how about Frieda?

39
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,693
- Well, how are you, Admiral?
- Well, hello, Nell.

40
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,220
You've been to the North Sea.

41
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:14,616
I sure have, and now
I'm on an extended leave of absence.

42
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,891
- Well, I'm...
- Gonna be here a long time.

43
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,690
Oh, you're my kind of man.

44
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,095
I like the way you move.

45
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,573
All I want to hear from you

46
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:39,330
is that I'm handsome,
virile, generous and kind.

47
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,576
What's the matter, Will?

48
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,730
Come on. Hush up.
You don't wanna wake everybody up.

49
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:59,293
Be quiet now.

50
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,820
Violet, what if you had woke him up?

51
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,057
He paid for all night,
and you know what he's like.

52
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:48,459
- Well, Will woke me up.
- You're not supposed to wake me up.

53
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:51,334
I don't get to sleep late any more.

54
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,975
Where'd you get those earrings?
They're awful pretty.

55
00:09:58,101 --> 00:09:59,614
Never mind where I got them.

56
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:01,580
He gave them to me.

57
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,659
Won them in a card game or something.

58
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,500
Then I won them from him. Don't!

59
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,852
He just pierced them for me last night.
That's how I won them.

60
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:13,370
It's a lucky thing I was drunk.

61
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,297
Will you give them to me
when I grow up?

62
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:20,255
Are you out of your mind?
These are real emeralds.

63
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:24,738
Otherwise I never would have let him
punch those ugly holes in my ears.

64
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,656
Get my coffee. I feel awful.

65
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,979
Ooka dooka soda cracker,
does your father chew tobacco?

66
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,329
- Ooka...
- Violet!

67
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:54,779
Get me my cane.

68
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,092
Oh, God.

69
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,940
Oh, and get me my absinthe.

70
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,771
Where the hell is that black bitch
with my coffee?

71
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,817
Best you handle that with care, Joe.

72
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:12,698
And you ought to leave off
suckling that boy.

73
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:16,450
You're gonna turn him spoiled,
just like you did with Violet.

74
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,732
Oh, I think she likes it, having big tits.

75
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:37,140
Antonia, Violet, get off that pony.
I got something to tell you.

76
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:39,252
I went to see Mama Mosebery last night.

77
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:42,054
I paid her $2 and she gave me
some uncooked turtle heart

78
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,899
to bring me luck for the lottery,

79
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,977
and I saw it move!

80
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:54,290
- Where you going?
- I ain't here, you know, to entertain you.

81
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,457
I gots deliveries upstairs.

82
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:59,015
- Well, how'd it taste like?
- What taste like?

83
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:02,975
- The raw turtle's heart.
- What do you think it tasted like?

84
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,934
Come on, please. Tell me.

85
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:13,259
Well, I am the child of a snapping turtle,
raised by alligators on panther's milk.

86
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:18,570
I'm a poisoned wolf from Bitter Creek,
and tonight's my night to howl.

87
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:35,290
Pedlars use the back door.

88
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:39,619
- Four, five, six...
- A pedlar.

89
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,778
Violet, go sit down and finish your okra.

90
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:46,576
I'm not raising you
so as your teeth will rot, you know.

91
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:51,210
What is this sheet doing here?
It doesn't belong to the house.

92
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:55,732
Six, seven, eight, nine...

93
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:57,937
Look what's coming.

94
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,779
...eleven, twelve...

95
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:04,013
Oh, hush up now. Come on, baby.

96
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,730
Hi. I'm Bellocq.
I'm looking for Madam Livingston.

97
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:19,817
Is she receiving callers?

98
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:22,211
Harry, get down here!

99
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:27,851
You may come in, Monsieur Bellocq.

100
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,936
Well, come in, then.

101
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:45,699
Good God,
you're in the wrong place, Monsieur.

102
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,016
We're not in the business of buying.

103
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:50,211
Madam, perhaps you know my name.

104
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:53,856
I have photographed in the district
many times.

105
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,169
Am I addressing Madam Livingston?

106
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,738
Yes, you are, Monsieur,

107
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,412
and you are too early.

108
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,850
My girls are all asleep.

109
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,657
They work late, you know.

110
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,700
It's 10:00 in the morning, Monsieur.

111
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,860
I require the light from the sun.
Now is the best time for me.

112
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:30,054
This young lady there,
she would be fine.

113
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:33,856
I run a good,
old-fashioned whorehouse, Monsieur,

114
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:37,619
and you seem a little rabbity to me.

115
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:41,899
Photographs?

116
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:47,175
What the hell kind of thing is that?
I don't cater to no inverts.

117
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,777
If you're looking for something different,

118
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,655
I can assure you, you can find it
right down here in New Orleans.

119
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,737
Madam, please don't tell me
about New Orleans.

120
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:59,011
I have lived here all my life.

121
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,336
I apologise, Monsieur.

122
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,533
You realise
I'm willing to pay for her time?

123
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:14,540
Violet, child, go get me
that package that Red brought.

124
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:24,135
Would you care for an absinthe?

125
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,940
Madam, the light. I beg your pardon.

126
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:30,371
Oh, the light. I had quite forgotten.

127
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,011
Well, go and take our Hattie.
She's very good, you know.

128
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,530
She will do whatever you want.

129
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:42,733
Thank you, ma'am.

130
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,374
And go take care of that child for her.

131
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,859
Want me to take my clothes off now?

132
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:32,499
- No. No. I'm liking you just as you are.
- You want me like this?

133
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,810
- Uncombed? I'm not even washed.
- Yes, yes.

134
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:55,372
I don't like that face.

135
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,411
It ain't a pleasant face.

136
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:03,337
- Now, this is a pleasant face.
- Quiet!

137
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,218
- I must have quiet now.
- Go away, Violet.

138
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:11,054
No. It's only she mustrt talk to you.

139
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:15,333
She's very beautiful.
She looks very like you.

140
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:19,457
Yes. Everybody notices it.
She's my sister.

141
00:18:19,941 --> 00:18:21,693
Mother, I ain't.

142
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,656
My face is very like my mother's,

143
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:30,410
but I got a fat stomach,
just like all my fathers.

144
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:39,771
Where the hell
is that goddamn whore's ass?

145
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,141
Hattie!

146
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:41,857
Hattie!

147
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:56,933
Maybe he's a voodoo man,
'cause he gots them bottles and stuff.

148
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,734
No. He's just another dumb john.

149
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:02,295
Jesus God, woman,
get up and get me something.

150
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:04,093
My head is killing me.

151
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:08,214
I need something.
Laudanum, something. Jesus Christ!

152
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:12,573
My mama's having her likeness made,
and it's all paid for, so there!

153
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:19,930
Why, hell, man,
she's only good for one thing.

154
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:23,373
Why would anybody
want to take a picture of a piece of ass?

155
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,379
Excuse me.
I will have to ask you to move away.

156
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,173
She must remain absolutely still.

157
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,850
Come on, honey pie, now.
Go along now.

158
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,854
You're still just a little bit drunk.

159
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,977
Where the hell
did you get those earrings?

160
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,375
What?

161
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,411
Give me those emeralds,

162
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:48,614
you skull-cracking,
cotton-brained whore!

163
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:50,737
You gave them to me last night!

164
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:53,375
Well, why would I give real emeralds
to a whore?

165
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:54,854
God damn you!

166
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:57,734
You bet me I wouldn't let you
put those holes in my ears

167
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:01,137
and I did, so those are mine!
I won them!

168
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:11,097
- They're mine!
- Oh, my sweet little piece of ass.

169
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:14,129
I remember now, Hattie. I remember.

170
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:43,611
Go to the bed
and take off your stocking, child.

171
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:27,970
Mama Mosebery, I've got this hair
growing around my nipples,

172
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:30,410
and I'm tired of plucking it.

173
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,492
You must pluck them on Good Friday.

174
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:37,660
Bury them that same day
and they'll never grow back.

175
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,492
Another new frock from Paris?

176
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:59,813
It's too early for a piece of tail.
It must be the bill collector.

177
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:04,454
Violet, you gonna be a lucky little one.

178
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:08,654
You gonna have so many men,
you won't know what to do with them.

179
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:11,295
No, no, please.
If she's busy, I'll come back later.

180
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:13,332
No, no, please.
I'd rather wait downstairs.

181
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:17,818
Come on. Come on. Look who I found
skulking in the hallway.

182
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:20,296
He say he's a photographist.

183
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:23,572
Hey, voodoo man,
I just got my fortune told. See?

184
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:27,975
No, no, no, no, no.

185
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:31,935
He says he have got something
for Hattie, but he won't show it to me.

186
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:34,655
Hattie, you've got a gentleman friend.

187
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:41,660
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to disturb you, ladies. I...

188
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,653
I have something for Miss Hattie.

189
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:46,978
She's in the bathtub.
She's always in the bathtub.

190
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:55,332
Oh, she is indisposed.
I would rather come...

191
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:56,496
- What's that?
- No, no, no.

192
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,896
I'd rather leave this off for Miss Hattie.

193
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:02,491
Don't give me that. You is a sport.

194
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:06,338
Hey! Let me see your camera!

195
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,732
Please stop! Stop!

196
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:15,416
Please don't do that. Stop! Please.

197
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,419
- Be careful.
- Oh, she's so pretty!

198
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:22,171
- Christ be, she looks like an angel.
- And everybody knows that ain't so.

199
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,212
Sure wish I had a picture like that
of myself.

200
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,660
Yeah, I could send one home
to my folks.

201
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,658
- How'd you do that?
- This is nice.

202
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:32,214
Magic, and I only need one second.

203
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:39,814
Well,, y pretty baby
Wort you co, e on over here?

204
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:44,810
Let your sweet papa whisper in your ear

205
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:50,973
Well, I', wild about the jelly roll
Sweet jelly roll of, ine

206
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,860
Cheat is right. You cheated me!

207
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:57,660
Well, there's my cards,
queens and aces. Let's see yours.

208
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:58,975
- Right here.
- What I got to do?

209
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:01,012
I got my hand right here!

210
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,372
What the hell is it?

211
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,173
- He is cheating.
- Let me go!

212
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:07,371
I got three aces.
I don't know what you've got there.

213
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:11,130
You're drunk, man. Get out of my place!

214
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:12,660
Your place?

215
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:16,536
To hell with you and your kind!

216
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:28,055
And don't you know,, ada, e,

217
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:28,861
that you are as common as whale piss?

218
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:31,455
That you are as common as whale piss?

219
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:40,011
Highpockets!
Oh, what have you done to... Oh, God!

220
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:44,494
Where the hell is that bum Harry?

221
00:24:44,621 --> 00:24:49,058
- My God, you've killed him.
- Well, I hope so.

222
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:52,617
Hattie, you must take the bitters
with the sweets.

223
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,301
Claude, go back to your piano.

224
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,974
Violet, go make me a pipe.

225
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:03,899
I can't take all this emotionalizing.

226
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:12,095
Harry, get in here and throw him out.

227
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:14,689
You can't throw him out.
He'll come back and kill me!

228
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,972
Well, look what that goddamn
son of a bitch did to my place.

229
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:22,253
- Well, you just can't leave him to die.
- Well, you just watch me.

230
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:27,614
Harry, go through his pockets
and take everything he's got.

231
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:42,130
- He only has about $100.
- Take it all.

232
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:44,900
Drop him on Emma Johnsors doorstep.

233
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:46,374
No!

234
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:50,850
Go on, then.
Pack up your bags and go with him.

235
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:55,171
And get rid of that hammer
that accidentally dropped on him.

236
00:25:55,621 --> 00:26:00,741
We don't do no carpentry work in here,
so we don't need no hammers.

237
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,933
Hattie, you know Nell didn't mean that.

238
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,411
Something must have went wrong when
your ma was carrying you in her pouch.

239
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,011
Yeah, something went wrong.
My mama was a whore.

240
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,735
She had me in a house just like this,
and now I'm a whore.

241
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:32,056
I don't know anything
except a man lying on top of me,

242
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:34,058
scared to death
I'm gonna get the little casino.

243
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:35,375
Oh, here we go again.

244
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:38,413
You think you're the only whore
in New Orleans scared of getting sick?

245
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,769
Oh, you just go ahead and laugh.

246
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:43,211
You're gonna end up peddling gas
for a thumbnail of cocaine.

247
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:46,377
I'll send for my trunk.

248
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,571
Everybody has a right
to do what they want.

249
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:58,660
- I wanna be a respectable person.
- With a gambler?

250
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:09,815
It's those respectable people who are
lying on top of you every night, Hattie.

251
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,173
You'll be back.

252
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:14,853
No, I won't!

253
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:18,500
I'm here for one purpose,
and that's to live my life to the hilt

254
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:20,657
and enjoy it the same way.

255
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:25,411
Come on, Violet.
Why aren't you packed?

256
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,938
I don't wanna go.

257
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:31,091
Violet, I am your mother.

258
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:34,452
No, you're not.
You even say so all the time.

259
00:27:39,861 --> 00:27:44,252
Violet, why are you acting this way?
What ails you?

260
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,374
Violet?

261
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:51,058
Violet, I'm talking to you!

262
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:55,060
Oh, God, I have a splitting headache.

263
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,812
I'm gonna stay here.

264
00:28:05,021 --> 00:28:06,215
I hate you.

265
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:10,380
If it werert for you, I would've been
out of here a long time ago.

266
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,537
Oh, you're so selfish. It just isn't fair!

267
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:15,050
Why does everybody else get to do
everything they wanna do

268
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,216
around here except me?

269
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:21,779
Just when I get a chance
to do something for myself!

270
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:28,055
Sometimes I wish I'd never been born.

271
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:18,376
This is Josephine, who just loves
young boys. Don't you, girl?

272
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,456
Hi.

273
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:33,291
Actually, my real name's Hildegarde.
My friends all call me Hildegarde.

274
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:36,901
- You from Tulane?
- Oh, yeah.

275
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:46,579
That's very brave.

276
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:15,132
You two ladies
are gonna change my luck.

277
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,691
Do you think I'm pretty?

278
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,771
Yes, I certainly do.

279
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:31,495
And the other girls? Do you like them?

280
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,452
Well, yes.

281
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,698
Then why do you sit here
night after night?

282
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:38,540
Why don't you go upstairs
with any of us?

283
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:42,611
That is for me to know
and for you to find out.

284
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,377
You're very old, aren't you?

285
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,896
Yes, very old.

286
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:59,139
- Very, very old?
- Yes. Very, very old.

287
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:02,255
Do you think you'll be dead soon?

288
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:06,096
- No, I don't think so.
- Well, why don't you think so?

289
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:09,811
Well, I don't feel like being dead yet.
I'm too young.

290
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:13,456
You said you're old,
so how can you be too young?

291
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,572
Gotta wet my whistle.

292
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:32,980
- Well, I think you'll be dead soon.
- Oh? Why?

293
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,855
Because Madam Nell said so.
She said you'd be better off dead.

294
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:39,654
Oh. Better off dead?

295
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,499
Madam says
there's something wrong with you,

296
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:44,454
that you're some kind of cream puff
or something.

297
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:47,459
She thinks that you're pathetic,
missing all the fun in life.

298
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:52,297
Perhaps Madam Nell is imagining
she knows more than she does.

299
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:56,776
- You think she's having fun?
- She's as happy as anybody.

300
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,500
Are you afraid you'll get little casino?

301
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:10,018
- The clap?
- Oh. No.

302
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:14,297
- Well, why, then?
- Do I ask you questions?

303
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:18,735
- I don't have to explain myself to a child.
- I'm not a child.

304
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:22,331
Excuse me, that is your opinion.
Leave me alone.

305
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,452
You hate me.

306
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:29,695
I have no time for hate or love.

307
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:41,500
Dear child, you're so full of life.

308
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:44,215
You don't have to take mine, do you?

309
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,372
Well, what have we here?

310
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:20,854
Are you selling little girls now,
Madam Nell?

311
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,053
White slavery, huh?

312
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:29,179
- Hey, do you know how to kiss?
- Of course I do. Everybody does.

313
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,019
Well, you watch out for him, Violet.

314
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:34,213
He's got a heart like an artichoke,
a leaf for every girl,

315
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,299
and a prick
on the end of each one of them.

316
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:42,979
Now, tell me, where did you get
those pretty, pearly teeth

317
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,932
and that beautiful brown hair?

318
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:48,053
My mama puts my teeth in
every morning with a crochet hook,

319
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:51,651
and I chose brown hair
'cause it don't show the dirt.

320
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:06,139
No. No, no. No, no.
That's not my style, you know.

321
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,695
I was just kidding around.

322
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:23,899
What'll you give me for a message?

323
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:26,819
I'll give you the back of my hand,
is what I'll give you.

324
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,613
Is there someone down there for me?

325
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:31,653
It's that horrible old coot again.

326
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,136
Do not be so snotty about him.

327
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:40,820
That old fool's idea that he likes me
is my ticket out of this place.

328
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:44,734
And besides, he is rich.

329
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:48,614
I know because I looked him up
in the phone book,

330
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:51,175
and he lives on St Charles.

331
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:55,010
And he could have
whatever he wants in the world,

332
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,299
and he wants me,

333
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:03,050
who doesn't give a damn for him.

334
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:23,580
"Me, who doesn't give a damn for him."

335
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:33,576
This is my little girl, Violet.

336
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:38,091
- How old are you, Violet?
- I don't know.

337
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,577
- Do you like her?
- She is very pretty.

338
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:48,974
Like Nell said, she's only for French.
She's still a virgin.

339
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,615
Well, I have it now. You may relax.

340
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,216
I feel like I'm gonna croak.

341
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:11,249
Violet, honey, go get us a drink.

342
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:24,297
Before the war, we used to close down
in the summertime,

343
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:27,970
but since the naval base came,
we're busy all year round now.

344
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:40,974
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you.

345
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:44,221
Perhaps we could make
another one now. Would you like to?

346
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:45,854
Yeah. Why not?

347
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:52,096
My breasts are very nice.

348
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:55,054
They're nicer
than any of the other girls'.

349
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:58,458
Do you think maybe I should
just show them a little bit?

350
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:01,573
Yes, that would be better. Let me see.

351
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:09,853
Well?

352
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,532
You have fine skin.

353
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:18,936
- Do you have any white powder?
- Sure, cheri. Right over there.

354
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,250
Put it on your shoulders here.

355
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,891
Yes, and on your breast.

356
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:52,339
I love the one you made of Fanny naked.

357
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:54,459
She sure is fat.

358
00:38:55,581 --> 00:38:59,620
Fanny's beautiful,
but I wasrt pleased with the light.

359
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:02,250
So you all ready for me now?

360
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:05,653
Are you content?

361
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:12,373
- Child, I'm afraid you'll have to go now.
- Me?

362
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:30,013
Lie back against... Put your head here.

363
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:34,333
Yes. Can you lay on your side?

364
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:37,340
That's it.

365
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,370
And put your hand behind your head.

366
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:45,979
That's it. That's perfect.
Don't move. Don't move at all.

367
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:58,691
You look very beautiful.

368
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,093
Just beautiful.

369
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,051
I'm very happy just now.

370
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:11,053
Just a few seconds,
and it will all be there perfectly.

371
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,739
Now, don't move.

372
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:20,616
That one should be very nice.

373
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,979
Now, don't move.

374
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,935
Never, never do that!

375
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:46,530
You have no idea
what you might have done!

376
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:51,018
I only wanted to see the picture.
I didn't do anything!

377
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,094
Violet.

378
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:08,250
You have to wait.
This is only a negative.

379
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:12,940
It has to be developed and printed and...
And then...

380
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:15,493
You love her!

381
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,537
Don't tell me how I feel.

382
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:22,573
Now, Violet,

383
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,019
I'm very sorry,

384
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,176
but you might have ruined
a whole day's work for me,

385
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,893
so you should be sorry, too.

386
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,171
Don't tell me how I feel.

387
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,892
I know about you. You love her.

388
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:43,975
Leave her be. She's just showing off.

389
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,376
Come on. Let's go down and eat.

390
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:04,689
I like that one better.

391
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,971
Two? You're trying to rob
a poor working girl.

392
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,934
I'll give you 25 cents, no more.

393
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:12,530
Three each. I'll sell it to you for a dollar.

394
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:16,336
A dollar? I got the same blouse
on Canal Street for 50 cents.

395
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:24,377
'Course, I likes my women
with a little more on the top and bottom.

396
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,014
Stop being so cheeky with me,

397
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:30,054
or I'll get my voodoo woman
to put grigri all over your piano.

398
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:34,413
Violet, come on down here
and let me see the front of that dress.

399
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:38,378
Oh, Violet, that ain't much of a dress.

400
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:41,140
When you're going to bust your cherry,
you best wear red satin.

401
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:44,378
That's why you a dumb nigger,
'cause you think like that.

402
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:48,733
She's a virgin. Do you want her
to be dressed like a picayune whore?

403
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:55,451
My God, Frieda,
you're as green as a goose turd.

404
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:04,170
- What's this?
- Open it and see.

405
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:08,495
It's the ninth bone
from the tail of a black cat,

406
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:11,215
guaranteed to bring you luck tonight.

407
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:15,420
Red Top!

408
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,930
Do not forget
that this guy is buying a virgin,

409
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:19,938
so she's got to act it right.

410
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:22,939
You've got to give him the idea
that you don't know nothing.

411
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,255
It should be like a rape.

412
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:26,895
You don't know.
Could be a different kind of guy,

413
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,058
someone that wants you
to act like she wants it.

414
00:43:30,181 --> 00:43:33,617
The main thing is to whimper and cry
at first when he starts,

415
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:36,414
but then you've got to act
like it feels good.

416
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,975
I know what to do. Leave me alone.

417
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:42,776
Well, don't act like you know it all.
You won't even get a tip that way.

418
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:47,338
Violet, you should touch him there,
you know, like it's accidental.

419
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,452
I know. I know all that.

420
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:51,890
Violet, you is a beautiful girl.

421
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:54,296
Now, all you need
is that handsome dress

422
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:57,413
and plenty diamonds
to elaborate the condition.

423
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:04,339
That was good.

424
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:08,815
You'd better enjoy it.
It's the last fine dinner you'll get on me.

425
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:10,932
- Oh, hell, no!
- Oh, no, no, no!

426
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:13,178
Isn't that so, Senator?

427
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:16,099
The navy's gonna
close the district down.

428
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:20,134
Well, I can't fight
the United States Navy.

429
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:23,893
We tried that already, and we lost.

430
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:47,936
Sit down, Violet. It's easier.

431
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:58,013
Honey, you want me to help you
put your powder on or anything?

432
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:00,416
- No, I can do it myself.
- All right.

433
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,536
God, I could remember
when she was born,

434
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:10,891
and now she's busting her cherry.

435
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:14,980
Jesus, Fanny, you were only
six years old when she was born.

436
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,130
Well, my, my, aren't you handsome?

437
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:34,570
Why haven't you been here before?
You're just my kind of man.

438
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:42,217
Oh, look at that.
Where you been hiding that thing?

439
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:47,020
How long has it been for you, cheri?

440
00:45:47,141 --> 00:45:50,213
Lie down right here. Give it to me, baby.

441
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,260
A virgin, bona fide.

442
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:17,536
- How old is she?
- Do you wanna put me in jail?

443
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:19,538
She's just old enough.

444
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,097
The finest delicacy
New Orleans has to offer,

445
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:37,850
and it's her wish
that one of you gentlemen be the first.

446
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:49,258
If you'll all join me in the parlour,
you'll get your opportunity.

447
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:50,939
Come on. Quick.

448
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,170
Come on.

449
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,337
Give me the ribbon, child.

450
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:03,860
Come on.

451
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,816
What am I bid, gentlemen?

452
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:20,250
Don't we get a look before we buy?

453
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:22,690
Kid, you can look all you want.

454
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:25,740
Just don't break the merchandise.

455
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:30,421
Hey, how do we know she is a virgin?

456
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:35,098
Have I ever lied to you before?
Satisfaction guaranteed.

457
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:50,260
Well, gentlemen, I'm getting impatient.

458
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:55,660
- I'll bid $100.
- Yeah!

459
00:47:57,301 --> 00:47:59,292
I'm bidding $120.

460
00:48:02,101 --> 00:48:04,456
- $150.
- Oh!

461
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:07,534
$50.

462
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:10,060
It's too late, Senator.

463
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,899
That's beautiful, Senator. Just beautiful.

464
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:15,730
Remember, gentlemen,
she's as fresh as a baby's lips.

465
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,340
- $160.
- $165.

466
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,099
- $175.
- $180.

467
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:22,098
Oh, they're getting out of my range.

468
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:23,290
$200!

469
00:48:23,421 --> 00:48:25,696
- $200?
- This is gonna be too much.

470
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:28,494
Gentlemen, gentlemen, $210.

471
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:31,816
I'll top that with $225.

472
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,978
Well, I'll bid $230.

473
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:39,377
- All right, $240.
- $250!

474
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:44,059
$275, madam.

475
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:47,611
- $280.
- Where did he come from?

476
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,459
I don't know.
I haven't seen him around here before.

477
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:51,617
- I don't know, but he's got money.
- $300!

478
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:53,814
Will you take a cheque?

479
00:48:53,941 --> 00:48:55,533
What would I do with a cheque?

480
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:01,656
Cash. I got cash. $400.

481
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:04,939
Jesus Christ. Who is he, Rockefeller?

482
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:08,657
Hey, this is kind of out of our league.
We don't have that kind of money.

483
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:11,375
Look, this is our night.
You werert invited here.

484
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:14,095
- Who do you think you are?
- Why don't you go someplace else?

485
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:18,294
- Hey! Watch what you're doing!
- Hang on, fellas. Wait up, wait.

486
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:21,259
Sold to the man with $400 cash.

487
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:58,410
Do not give him any argument.

488
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:15,138
You want some whisky?

489
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:25,498
Well, Jesus,
I didn't mean the whole damn thing.

490
00:50:27,461 --> 00:50:29,099
I'm glad it's you.

491
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:34,257
Why are you glad it's me?

492
00:50:34,421 --> 00:50:39,051
Well, you look nice,
and you have a nice chest.

493
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:46,850
I can feel the steam inside me
right through my dress.

494
00:51:02,341 --> 00:51:06,050
Let him have his young peach.
I like my fruit ripe.

495
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:13,458
Gives me queasy innards
to see a thing like that.

496
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:41,016
- Isn't there a lock?
- Madam Nell don't allow no locks.

497
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:44,979
God damn.

498
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:48,214
For $400,
I'd like to have that door locked.

499
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:02,739
I hope you're gonna be
real gentle on me, being my first time.

500
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,213
Want a whisky?

501
00:52:15,301 --> 00:52:16,700
Please...

502
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:10,251
You wanna go for a little roll in the kip?

503
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:22,372
Are you sure you don't wanna go
for a little roll in the kip?

504
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:24,450
Smells bad in here.

505
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:31,289
- You're feeling badly?
- Oh, I feel fine.

506
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:36,364
I feel all right. I'm happy. I feel fine.

507
00:53:36,774 --> 00:53:39,004
And I could probably
accommodate personally

508
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:42,683
every man at the house if I decided to.

509
00:54:16,014 --> 00:54:17,493
Violet?

510
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:22,046
Jesus.

511
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,328
Madam!

512
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:25,728
Violet?

513
00:54:25,854 --> 00:54:28,368
Get a doctor! She's been murdered!

514
00:54:29,694 --> 00:54:32,083
Violet! Oh, my baby!

515
00:54:33,214 --> 00:54:34,647
Violet?

516
00:54:40,134 --> 00:54:41,408
Baby?

517
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:46,448
Well, I'd like to know
where the hell you all been.

518
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:50,328
I've been lying here forever.
You don't care about me at all.

519
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,048
Oh, Violet, that really wasrt funny.

520
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,533
I know it's not funny. Am I laughing?

521
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:06,084
So you had a live one, huh?

522
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:08,211
Come on. That's what it's all about.

523
00:55:08,334 --> 00:55:11,246
Maybe now you'll let us sleep
in the mornings when we feel bad.

524
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:12,409
Yeah.

525
00:55:22,174 --> 00:55:27,407
The war. Her father got killed,
her mother forced to go to work.

526
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:29,527
You know, she's a virgin.

527
00:55:29,654 --> 00:55:32,566
Well, I ain't too particular
about the virgin part,

528
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:34,969
but I hear tell there's disease.

529
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:37,688
I got no sick girls here, Monsieur.

530
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:40,405
Who told you about my place? A friend?

531
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:41,683
Yes'm.

532
00:55:42,374 --> 00:55:44,490
Well, if you can't trust a friend...

533
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:59,528
Now, how about it?
Pure as the driven snow.

534
00:56:10,254 --> 00:56:11,653
Can I have a little bit more of that wine?

535
00:56:11,774 --> 00:56:13,287
Yes, sweet face.

536
00:56:13,654 --> 00:56:16,373
- Thank you. You spoil me.
- Oh, I know.

537
00:56:20,774 --> 00:56:23,652
Oh, my gosh. That took my breath away.

538
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:27,813
There are only two things to do
on rainy days,

539
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:30,448
and I don't like to play cards.

540
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:37,529
I propose a toast.
To a quick end to the war.

541
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:41,450
- Hear, hear.
- Ja. To the end of the war.

542
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:54,242
Catch it.

543
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:55,843
Get it.

544
00:56:56,574 --> 00:56:57,973
Oh, wow.

545
00:56:58,694 --> 00:57:02,448
- It's bad luck. It means death.
- Open the damn windows. It'll fly out.

546
00:57:02,574 --> 00:57:04,929
No. It has to go out
the same way it came in.

547
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:09,445
Oh, I'm gonna get that little bird.
Come down here. Come... You...

548
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:23,574
Ain't it pretty? It's so tiny.

549
00:57:38,174 --> 00:57:40,404
Come on, honey. Don't be shy.

550
00:57:46,054 --> 00:57:48,852
Now. Tell them for me now, please.

551
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:53,489
Well, I've asked Hattie to be my wife,

552
00:57:54,214 --> 00:57:58,446
and she has personally agreed,
so we're gonna be married.

553
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:04,727
- Great. We're gonna have a wedding.
- When? 'Cause we are ready.

554
00:58:06,694 --> 00:58:10,289
Well, actually, we're gonna
get married in his hometown.

555
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:15,291
Yeah, you see, I got me this little house
in St. Louis, Missouri,

556
00:58:15,414 --> 00:58:18,611
so I kind of thought
we'd be married there.

557
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:24,365
Well, Hattie,
you finally nailed one, huh?

558
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:34,093
Arert you gonna answer me, Violet?

559
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:43,531
I had to do it this way.

560
00:58:46,854 --> 00:58:50,449
I wasrt even sure he really meant it
until he come today.

561
00:58:52,134 --> 00:58:54,602
But he's got the ring and everything.

562
00:58:55,974 --> 00:58:58,807
It's gonna be really big things for us.

563
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:04,613
I told him that you was my sister.
He don't know any different.

564
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:08,090
As soon as the right time comes,
I'm gonna tell him.

565
00:59:08,534 --> 00:59:11,685
It's lucky he doesn't even mind
about little Will.

566
00:59:15,694 --> 00:59:16,968
Want some?

567
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,772
Hattie, our train leaves in a half an hour.

568
00:59:26,614 --> 00:59:28,730
All right, honey. I'm coming.

569
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,086
Honey, I'll send for you.
I promise you that.

570
00:59:44,454 --> 00:59:46,172
Do I look all right?

571
01:00:08,774 --> 01:00:10,685
- One card.
- One card.

572
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,132
Don't you fellas wanna do something?
It's our day off.

573
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:15,846
Well, we are doing something.

574
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:18,613
I tell you, you put men in a room
with a bunch of whores

575
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:20,645
and all they wanna do is play poker.

576
01:00:20,774 --> 01:00:23,686
- I'll never understand men. Never.
- Really.

577
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:26,009
Well, we still have Papa.

578
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:29,574
Shall I take you all to the burlesque?

579
01:00:29,774 --> 01:00:32,163
Or we could go to the picture show.

580
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:35,013
- I know. Let's play sardines.
- Yeah.

581
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:37,125
And Papa... Papa can be it.

582
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:39,567
I don't know this game, sardines.

583
01:00:39,694 --> 01:00:41,047
- I never heard of it.
- You'll learn.

584
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:43,927
We made it up. It's really a lot of fun.

585
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:46,932
- It's kind of like hide-and-seek.
- Yeah.

586
01:00:48,534 --> 01:00:49,933
One,

587
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:51,282
two,

588
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,972
three,

589
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:54,573
four,

590
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:56,093
five,

591
01:00:56,214 --> 01:00:57,249
six,

592
01:00:57,694 --> 01:01:00,128
seven, eight,

593
01:01:00,254 --> 01:01:03,212
nine, ten!

594
01:01:10,134 --> 01:01:11,806
- Look under the bed.
- Oh, I see.

595
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:14,251
He's not in Agnes' room.

596
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:17,727
God damn it.

597
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:19,851
Did you find him?

598
01:01:24,654 --> 01:01:28,329
Papa? I know you're in here.

599
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:41,529
I didn't look in Gussie's room.

600
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:46,722
Damn it.

601
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:16,168
You were easy. I heard you breathing.

602
01:02:34,494 --> 01:02:36,246
Did you like that?

603
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:48,609
Hey.

604
01:02:48,734 --> 01:02:52,409
He's been real bad. It's been hard
to keep him quiet. Get in. Get in.

605
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:56,811
- Sardine.
- Caught you. Sardine.

606
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:58,413
Is he in there?

607
01:03:01,414 --> 01:03:03,405
Papa ain't no cream puff.

608
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:06,093
All right.

609
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:13,804
It's just a trick.
She hates to be losing a game.

610
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:15,890
God, that sure was a fall.

611
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,531
It's not funny. I think I broke something.

612
01:03:21,654 --> 01:03:24,214
You broke something, all right.

613
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:34,252
I love you once. I love you twice.
I love you more than beans and rice.

614
01:04:06,934 --> 01:04:09,971
How about a little something
for the Professor?

615
01:04:16,694 --> 01:04:19,925
- What will become of her now?
- What's going on with you?

616
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:23,933
You don't have to worry about her.
She's made a lot of money.

617
01:04:24,054 --> 01:04:26,045
She can do as she likes.

618
01:04:36,654 --> 01:04:39,646
She's only 12. She's completely alone.

619
01:04:48,734 --> 01:04:51,168
Bellocq, you're in love with her.

620
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:54,965
- Don't be absurd.
- I've seen it a hundred times.

621
01:04:56,574 --> 01:05:01,329
I am old and life is so long.

622
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,565
Stop that goo-gooing.

623
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:37,653
Nine. Thank you. I have a nine.

624
01:05:37,774 --> 01:05:40,288
You're quite welcome.
I knew you needed it.

625
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:42,132
Five. What did I roll?

626
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:43,243
- Eight.
- Eight.

627
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:44,887
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

628
01:05:45,094 --> 01:05:48,291
I got an eight. I'm winning. Very good.

629
01:05:50,174 --> 01:05:51,402
Five.

630
01:05:54,894 --> 01:05:56,168
Nine.

631
01:05:58,494 --> 01:06:02,043
I'm standing here thinking I'm ready
to get my picture took.

632
01:06:02,174 --> 01:06:05,325
- Violet, please go away.
- Go away, Violet.

633
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:06,967
I got a five.

634
01:06:07,574 --> 01:06:08,802
I've won.

635
01:06:09,774 --> 01:06:12,242
You're stupid and old.

636
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,893
Red Top,

637
01:06:38,854 --> 01:06:42,483
when you grow up
and you have a beard and a moustache,

638
01:06:42,614 --> 01:06:45,367
I'm gonna think you're very handsome,

639
01:06:46,174 --> 01:06:48,972
and I'm gonna love you up
hard and long.

640
01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:54,445
Well, especially me,
'cause I am the lover boy.

641
01:06:57,934 --> 01:07:00,448
I bet neither of you never done nothing.

642
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:03,247
Huh? I had me a piece of tail yesterday.

643
01:07:03,374 --> 01:07:05,649
All the girls in the district
give me free loving.

644
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:06,843
Yeah.

645
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:12,293
- Nonny, you never did it, did you?
- 'Course I have. Lots of times.

646
01:07:12,414 --> 01:07:14,052
Then tell me what it feels like.

647
01:07:14,174 --> 01:07:17,928
Well, it feels good.
For God's sakes, what else?

648
01:07:18,094 --> 01:07:20,289
Tell me exactly how it feels.

649
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:25,532
I knows how it feels,
but I just don't know how to describe it.

650
01:07:25,654 --> 01:07:28,122
It's like you get this tingling feeling
along your back,

651
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:31,326
and this funny feeling
starts creeping up your toes.

652
01:07:32,974 --> 01:07:36,569
- Do it, Nonny.
- What? You must be crazy.

653
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:41,729
- Do it to me right now. Prove you can.
- Who? Big you and little I?

654
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:43,892
Get over there.

655
01:07:48,974 --> 01:07:51,124
I'm gonna make you
my lover man, Nonny.

656
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:53,131
I'm gonna love you up
real hard and long.

657
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:55,973
Let me up! Let me up!

658
01:07:58,854 --> 01:08:01,732
- What you gonna say, boy?
- Nothing.

659
01:08:01,854 --> 01:08:03,890
He ain't gonna say nothing.

660
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,963
Violet, baby, you is very bold,
and the way you been raised,

661
01:08:08,094 --> 01:08:10,483
you don't know nothing
about the real world.

662
01:08:10,614 --> 01:08:12,844
White and coloured,
they can't be together,

663
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:15,010
as far as that's concerned.

664
01:08:15,574 --> 01:08:19,487
I can do what I want.
Everybody does that with everybody.

665
01:08:19,614 --> 01:08:20,683
And coloured?

666
01:08:20,814 --> 01:08:23,248
Do you see coloured men
upstairs for that?

667
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:24,887
No, you don't, Violet.

668
01:08:25,174 --> 01:08:29,247
I'm a church-going woman
that was married by a preacher,

669
01:08:29,374 --> 01:08:33,606
and what I can say is
you have gots to leave my Nonny alone.

670
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:36,285
You pushing far, Violet.

671
01:08:38,174 --> 01:08:39,766
She certainly is.

672
01:08:40,134 --> 01:08:41,249
Harry!

673
01:08:44,974 --> 01:08:46,930
Let me go!

674
01:08:48,694 --> 01:08:51,208
Let me go!

675
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:53,806
No! Harry!

676
01:08:54,614 --> 01:08:56,764
Let me go!

677
01:08:58,974 --> 01:09:00,123
No!

678
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:08,364
You can't beat a child.
It only teaches her to beat others.

679
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:11,691
I'll run my business
and you tend to yours, Papa.

680
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:23,851
It didn't hurt.

681
01:09:25,054 --> 01:09:27,329
Hard-headed and hard-assed.

682
01:09:43,174 --> 01:09:46,132
Hey, Papa,
you sure you won't stay for dinner?

683
01:09:46,254 --> 01:09:47,846
No. No, thank you.

684
01:11:11,214 --> 01:11:14,570
- And how did you find me?
- I looked you up in the telephone book.

685
01:11:14,894 --> 01:11:18,682
- Anybody can think of that.
- I don't have a telephone, Violet.

686
01:11:21,854 --> 01:11:24,846
Well, I followed you here. Lots of times.

687
01:11:26,654 --> 01:11:28,610
Have you had your supper?

688
01:11:31,174 --> 01:11:33,688
- What's all this?
- I've been working.

689
01:11:36,174 --> 01:11:39,052
You mean this is your work?
Photographing?

690
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:41,893
Yes. This is how I earn my living.

691
01:11:42,814 --> 01:11:44,532
God, that's so easy.

692
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,614
Well, easier than working in a house.

693
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:56,085
You've decided to run away?

694
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,929
- Where do you sleep?
- Upstairs.

695
01:12:00,574 --> 01:12:02,166
I wanna see it.

696
01:12:12,814 --> 01:12:16,727
- Why do you lock it?
- I don't know. Habit.

697
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:19,523
Sometimes children
break into my house.

698
01:12:19,894 --> 01:12:20,929
Why?

699
01:12:21,934 --> 01:12:25,085
I imagine they're curious
about me and my camera.

700
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:28,087
- The neighbourhood has turned bad.
- Why?

701
01:12:28,574 --> 01:12:32,613
"Why? Why? Why?" I don't know why.
'Cause of the whorehouses.

702
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:41,534
How come you got no electricity?

703
01:12:48,534 --> 01:12:50,331
Well, I like this room.

704
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,048
Ooka dooka soda...

705
01:12:56,174 --> 01:12:58,768
Well, you certainly did it, didn't you?

706
01:13:00,094 --> 01:13:01,243
Violet?

707
01:13:04,494 --> 01:13:06,052
Can I stay here?

708
01:13:07,814 --> 01:13:09,850
Yes, you may, if you want to.

709
01:13:09,974 --> 01:13:12,932
I do. Will you sleep with me
and take care of me?

710
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:14,123
No.

711
01:13:16,014 --> 01:13:17,606
And why not?

712
01:13:18,454 --> 01:13:19,728
Because...

713
01:13:20,454 --> 01:13:22,763
'Cause I'm not sure why exactly.

714
01:13:23,174 --> 01:13:25,210
You're afraid of me.

715
01:13:25,774 --> 01:13:26,923
Perhaps.

716
01:13:27,214 --> 01:13:31,173
I want you to be my lover
and buy me stockings and clothes and...

717
01:13:31,294 --> 01:13:33,728
You don't know what you're saying,
Violet.

718
01:13:33,854 --> 01:13:36,891
I won't even charge anything at all,
and you can visit me at my house

719
01:13:37,014 --> 01:13:38,732
and be my fancy man.

720
01:13:38,974 --> 01:13:41,442
I thought you were running away
from the house.

721
01:13:41,734 --> 01:13:46,091
Oh, yes. They can't beat me like that.
No, not me.

722
01:13:46,974 --> 01:13:49,613
- I agree, absolutely.
- You do?

723
01:13:49,734 --> 01:13:52,487
Otherwise, I should already
have beaten you for breaking my bed.

724
01:13:52,614 --> 01:13:55,447
- You hit me once.
- Yes, and I'm sorry.

725
01:13:56,894 --> 01:13:58,964
You love my mother more than me.

726
01:13:59,094 --> 01:14:01,483
I know about those things
better than you.

727
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:05,568
You always know those things
about men when you're a woman.

728
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:08,811
Some men are different.

729
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:11,367
I'm different.

730
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:15,533
Well,

731
01:14:17,614 --> 01:14:20,082
maybe not after all,

732
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:24,524
because I'm all yours, Violet.

733
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:28,892
All mine?

734
01:14:29,374 --> 01:14:30,693
Yes.

735
01:14:36,094 --> 01:14:40,770
I love you once. I love you twice.
I love you more than beans and rice.

736
01:14:49,374 --> 01:14:51,490
I'm gonna make you so happy.

737
01:14:52,094 --> 01:14:54,927
You're just my kind of man.
You really are.

738
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,212
I'm really good, you know, cheri.

739
01:14:57,334 --> 01:15:01,088
Don't talk to me like that, please.
Don't talk like a whore.

740
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:03,729
Then what do you want me to say?

741
01:15:03,894 --> 01:15:06,124
I feel something inside me, so I say it,

742
01:15:06,254 --> 01:15:09,166
and when you go away,
it hurts me right here.

743
01:15:11,614 --> 01:15:13,730
You're only hungry, perhaps.

744
01:15:13,854 --> 01:15:17,563
And what's wrong with whores, anyhow?
I thought you liked us.

745
01:15:21,054 --> 01:15:25,445
Everybody says I'm pretty
and getting to be filled out soon,

746
01:15:26,414 --> 01:15:29,053
and all the other men like me.

747
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:30,846
Don't you like me?

748
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:18,046
You left me all alone.

749
01:18:18,174 --> 01:18:19,812
I left you a note.

750
01:18:20,174 --> 01:18:22,051
Well, I can't read yet.

751
01:18:22,774 --> 01:18:25,652
- I brought you a present.
- A present? Where?

752
01:18:35,054 --> 01:18:36,407
Where is it?

753
01:18:46,574 --> 01:18:48,132
She's beautiful.

754
01:18:53,774 --> 01:18:56,049
Why did you buy me a doll?

755
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:59,769
- Every child should have a doll.
- I'm a child to you?

756
01:19:29,734 --> 01:19:30,883
Violet.

757
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,483
Violet!

758
01:20:14,054 --> 01:20:15,203
Violet!

759
01:20:36,894 --> 01:20:38,691
Violet, what ails you?

760
01:20:42,214 --> 01:20:44,170
What's the matter, Violet?

761
01:20:45,414 --> 01:20:47,484
Violet, I'm talking to you!

762
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:52,167
I've got such a splitting headache.

763
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:57,450
You're so selfish, Violet.
It's just not fair.

764
01:20:57,574 --> 01:21:00,566
Everybody gets to do what they want,
except me.

765
01:21:04,534 --> 01:21:08,288
Violet, did you take those bottles
that I left on the table in the front room?

766
01:21:08,414 --> 01:21:10,974
- The ones with the glass stoppers?
- Yes.

767
01:21:11,094 --> 01:21:12,971
Yes. I was playing with them.

768
01:21:13,094 --> 01:21:15,369
Well, what did you do
with what was inside of them?

769
01:21:15,494 --> 01:21:17,291
Well, I poured it out.

770
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,293
My God, Violet, that's silver nitrate.
I use it for my photographs.

771
01:21:21,414 --> 01:21:25,123
- Whatever made you do such a thing?
- It smelled so bad.

772
01:21:31,374 --> 01:21:33,888
Because of your thoughtlessness,
I have to go all the way uptown

773
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:37,450
to replace those chemicals,
and they're very expensive.

774
01:21:54,894 --> 01:21:56,566
Why are you crying?

775
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:02,764
For joy and to amuse myself.

776
01:22:04,494 --> 01:22:06,564
You wanna come with me?

777
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:09,322
No.

778
01:22:30,774 --> 01:22:32,412
What are those?

779
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:35,002
- What are what?
- Those clothes.

780
01:22:36,014 --> 01:22:38,687
Oh, these? These are pyjamas.

781
01:22:40,294 --> 01:22:44,048
You aren't going to tell me
you've never in your life seen pyjamas?

782
01:22:44,174 --> 01:22:47,132
No john I ever saw
wore anything like that.

783
01:23:40,654 --> 01:23:42,645
I'm tired of lying here.

784
01:23:43,614 --> 01:23:45,525
If you would have stayed quiet
for one second more,

785
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:46,723
I would have had it.

786
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:48,606
It's always one second more with you.

787
01:23:48,734 --> 01:23:51,328
And why do you wanna take my picture
again and again?

788
01:23:51,454 --> 01:23:54,287
I'm tired of having to deal with a child.

789
01:23:55,454 --> 01:23:58,890
I don't have to stay here
and listen to you yell at me.

790
01:24:00,934 --> 01:24:02,208
Well, I'm leaving,

791
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:05,451
and you won't have anyone
to photograph any more.

792
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:38,171
So this is how you would repay me.

793
01:24:38,294 --> 01:24:41,650
Repay you for what? For what?
I don't owe you anything at all.

794
01:24:42,814 --> 01:24:47,410
Get out. Get out, Violet, before I kill you.
If you destroy any more of my pictures...

795
01:24:47,534 --> 01:24:50,844
Who cares about your pictures?
Who buys them? No one.

796
01:25:12,334 --> 01:25:13,528
Sinners.

797
01:25:13,814 --> 01:25:15,088
Sinners!

798
01:25:19,774 --> 01:25:21,332
These reeking pest holes

799
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:26,528
are inabited by 1,500 angels
of death and damnation.

800
01:25:27,054 --> 01:25:32,412
Four hags, in palatial palaces of guilt,
imperil the virtue of every innocent girl.

801
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:38,687
And what, dearly beloved,

802
01:25:38,814 --> 01:25:44,013
can we do about the weakness
of lusting men and soft women?

803
01:25:45,734 --> 01:25:48,328
Violet, where you been?
We better get out of here.

804
01:25:48,454 --> 01:25:51,014
If they catch us, we'll go
to the Home for Good Shepherds.

805
01:25:51,134 --> 01:25:54,126
Brothers and sisters, unite.

806
01:25:56,014 --> 01:25:57,367
Stupid puritans.

807
01:25:57,734 --> 01:26:00,806
Nell says they're just horny men
who come around to snoop.

808
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:02,970
Well, this time they're really gonna do it.

809
01:26:03,094 --> 01:26:05,892
Mama Mosebery says
everything will be closed down.

810
01:26:06,014 --> 01:26:08,847
- So what if they do?
- I don't know.

811
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,770
- What'll become of me?
- You can be my fancy man.

812
01:26:39,414 --> 01:26:41,211
She's gone mad.

813
01:26:41,894 --> 01:26:44,966
I told you. Even Madam Nell.

814
01:26:48,774 --> 01:26:51,288
The evil eye is on us all.

815
01:26:52,734 --> 01:26:55,487
Look, circles of salt.

816
01:26:56,734 --> 01:26:59,168
Somebody put a spell on you.

817
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:08,291
Ola Mae, take this holy water

818
01:27:08,414 --> 01:27:11,167
and wash the kitchen
and Miss Nell's room.

819
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:53,926
In Rome,

820
01:27:54,934 --> 01:27:56,606
times like these,

821
01:27:58,694 --> 01:28:02,130
barbarians came. Oh, did they.

822
01:28:04,374 --> 01:28:06,763
It goes on and on.

823
01:28:18,014 --> 01:28:20,164
I heard the doorbell.

824
01:28:20,574 --> 01:28:22,530
Where is everybody?

825
01:28:23,414 --> 01:28:25,848
Death is keeping them away.

826
01:28:26,454 --> 01:28:30,845
There are reasons for death,
good reasons.

827
01:28:31,374 --> 01:28:35,367
Oh, stop talking, would you? Stop it.

828
01:28:35,814 --> 01:28:37,088
Excuse me.

829
01:28:39,174 --> 01:28:42,405
Dirty roughnecks
with their rotten manners.

830
01:28:47,294 --> 01:28:51,253
Dirty roughnecks
with their rotten manners.

831
01:29:15,774 --> 01:29:18,607
We'll be at the station for an hour
if you change your mind.

832
01:29:18,734 --> 01:29:20,884
- Bye.
- Come on, children. Let's go.

833
01:29:25,294 --> 01:29:27,125
Terrible piano anyhow.

834
01:29:27,254 --> 01:29:29,245
Oh, you look so fine.

835
01:29:29,374 --> 01:29:34,892
Violet, old gal, we'll go to Chicago.
Chicago is the money town.

836
01:29:36,014 --> 01:29:38,608
We'll have ourselves a time there.

837
01:29:38,734 --> 01:29:40,850
Take the northbound
New Orleans Central.

838
01:29:40,974 --> 01:29:42,089
Hey.

839
01:29:47,814 --> 01:29:50,044
Careful, now. It has a delicate frame.

840
01:30:02,614 --> 01:30:07,210
Where are you going, Violet?
Where's that no-good mother of yours?

841
01:30:08,214 --> 01:30:12,685
- I gots a postcard from her and a letter.
- With no return address, huh?

842
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:17,529
- Don't talk about her.
- Oh, you're breaking my heart.

843
01:31:29,574 --> 01:31:31,724
Papa, what are you doing here?

844
01:31:32,214 --> 01:31:34,091
I'm going to marry you.

845
01:31:37,054 --> 01:31:38,612
Can I ask all the girls?

846
01:31:38,734 --> 01:31:42,727
But Antonia and Justine is gone,
and Odette and Josephine.

847
01:31:42,854 --> 01:31:44,606
- Can we go get them?
- Of course.

848
01:31:44,734 --> 01:31:46,372
Well, what'll I wear?

849
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:49,002
You can wear
whatever your heart desires,

850
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:51,523
just as long as you do it with me.

851
01:32:02,014 --> 01:32:05,484
Her father unknown,
and the mother deserted the child.

852
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:10,808
My mama's name was Hildegarde.
Hildegarde Marr. M-A-R-R.

853
01:32:14,934 --> 01:32:19,883
- And she was Caucasian or other?
- She was a whore, Father.

854
01:32:22,414 --> 01:32:27,090
Those whom God has united
let no man put asunder.

855
01:32:31,454 --> 01:32:33,410
You may kiss the bride.

856
01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:06,323
Papa, there's a good spot over there.

857
01:33:06,454 --> 01:33:07,443
No, no!

858
01:33:07,574 --> 01:33:09,804
Turn around, Papa.
The other place was better.

859
01:33:12,374 --> 01:33:13,693
Sit down.

860
01:33:17,654 --> 01:33:20,452
Oh, God!

861
01:33:25,014 --> 01:33:26,083
Well.

862
01:33:29,134 --> 01:33:31,568
We'll just have to get out and push.

863
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:36,889
But I am wearing my new dress
for Chicago.

864
01:33:37,014 --> 01:33:39,972
We're all wearing our new dresses,
you damn fool.

865
01:33:40,094 --> 01:33:43,325
Well, let's get our damn clothes off
and celebrate this thing.

866
01:33:45,974 --> 01:33:48,442
I'm not getting out, and that's that.

867
01:34:05,214 --> 01:34:07,284
Come on, Frieda!

868
01:34:08,294 --> 01:34:10,854
- Pass me some more oysters.
- Anyone want some of the sauce?

869
01:34:10,974 --> 01:34:12,327
Oh, yeah.

870
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:14,892
Try this, Odette.

871
01:34:17,214 --> 01:34:20,172
- Papa, come eat.
- Yes, I'm coming.

872
01:36:00,334 --> 01:36:02,928
Now, Papa,
you didn't eat anything before.

873
01:36:04,614 --> 01:36:05,933
Now eat.

874
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:13,283
Y'all gonna enjoy yourselves today.

875
01:36:15,054 --> 01:36:17,443
How come one man
got so many women?

876
01:36:18,894 --> 01:36:20,850
He just got married today.

877
01:36:20,974 --> 01:36:23,568
And guess who he married. Guess.

878
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:25,013
Well, it doesn't matter,

879
01:36:25,134 --> 01:36:29,366
'cause he's the luckiest son of a bitch
I ever seen on a wedding day.

880
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:41,568
Why are you ringing?
You have everything you need.

881
01:37:41,694 --> 01:37:44,447
I want some hot chocolate
with brandy in it.

882
01:37:44,574 --> 01:37:46,292
I feel poorly today.

883
01:37:46,734 --> 01:37:50,010
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it this time?

884
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:51,362
You know.

885
01:37:51,934 --> 01:37:54,050
Oh, yes. Of course. I forgot.

886
01:37:55,174 --> 01:37:57,563
I'm gonna sleep all day today.

887
01:37:58,654 --> 01:38:02,090
Well, how is that any different
from the last two weeks?

888
01:38:03,654 --> 01:38:05,292
Get me some cocoa.

889
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:09,005
And the bottle of brandy.

890
01:38:12,614 --> 01:38:13,888
Do you...

891
01:38:14,014 --> 01:38:16,892
I mean, did the girls teach you

892
01:38:18,254 --> 01:38:22,088
how to prevent yourself
from becoming with child?

893
01:38:22,694 --> 01:38:23,888
I mean, did you know you...

894
01:38:24,014 --> 01:38:28,371
Don't tell me about that.
Don't tell me about the things I know.

895
01:38:32,254 --> 01:38:34,848
Hard-headed berry
don't make good soup.

896
01:38:35,974 --> 01:38:38,408
That's what Ola Mae
used to say about me.

897
01:38:38,534 --> 01:38:39,683
I know.

898
01:38:56,894 --> 01:38:58,964
- Violet.
- Mama?

899
01:38:59,094 --> 01:39:00,652
Yes, it's Mama.

900
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:04,847
Oh, Violet. My baby. My darling.

901
01:39:07,014 --> 01:39:09,130
Look at the way you've grown.

902
01:39:09,654 --> 01:39:12,293
We have been looking everywhere
for you.

903
01:39:16,254 --> 01:39:17,573
Here we go.

904
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:23,568
It's okay.

905
01:39:24,654 --> 01:39:26,406
I told him all about you, Violet,

906
01:39:26,534 --> 01:39:29,253
and he insisted
that we come and get you.

907
01:39:32,294 --> 01:39:34,649
You smell good, Mama.

908
01:39:35,414 --> 01:39:38,053
We've got a big, beautiful house
in St. Louis.

909
01:39:38,174 --> 01:39:40,369
Mr Fuller, he's a pavement contractor.

910
01:39:40,494 --> 01:39:43,611
You know, he's paved
almost every street in St. Louis,

911
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:46,089
and he wants you
to come home with us.

912
01:39:47,334 --> 01:39:48,892
But I live here.

913
01:39:50,574 --> 01:39:53,213
I and Papa. Papa and I are married now.

914
01:39:54,454 --> 01:39:57,844
Mrs Fuller,
I'm so glad to see you are doing so well,

915
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:00,652
and little Will.

916
01:40:04,254 --> 01:40:06,609
Mr Fuller and I want nothing to do
with you, Mr Bellocq.

917
01:40:06,734 --> 01:40:11,091
We had to go to some awful places
to find out about you and my daughter.

918
01:40:11,934 --> 01:40:14,323
Hattie, we're married now, so stop this.

919
01:40:14,454 --> 01:40:18,732
It is not legal without my consent.
Mr Fuller's already seen to that.

920
01:40:18,894 --> 01:40:21,169
You deserted the child.
I don't mean to be cruel...

921
01:40:21,294 --> 01:40:23,171
How dare you say that?
I did no such thing!

922
01:40:23,294 --> 01:40:24,773
Now, Mr Bellocq, be sensible.

923
01:40:25,374 --> 01:40:30,528
Now, I wanna send Violet to school,
and she has to be raised right.

924
01:40:32,374 --> 01:40:35,047
Now, I know that in a lot of ways,

925
01:40:35,174 --> 01:40:38,450
we've got no right
to get up on a high horse,

926
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:41,611
but now Mrs Fuller
has overcome her past,

927
01:40:41,734 --> 01:40:43,884
and she wants the same for Violet.

928
01:40:48,054 --> 01:40:50,284
Well, you cannot take her!

929
01:40:56,294 --> 01:40:58,250
I can't live without her.

930
01:40:59,214 --> 01:41:00,533
That's all.

931
01:41:03,694 --> 01:41:05,764
Papa, you can come with us.

932
01:41:16,294 --> 01:41:18,603
Come on, Violet.
You don't need to pack.

933
01:41:18,734 --> 01:41:20,292
We'll get you whatever you need

Make sure you get Violet.
