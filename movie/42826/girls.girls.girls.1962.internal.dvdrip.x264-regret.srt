1
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,934
Girls! Girls!

2
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,273
Girls! Girls! Girls!

3
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,379
Goin' swimmin'

4
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,480
Girls.

5
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,640
In bikinis.

6
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,749
Girls.

7
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,951
Walkin' and a-wigglin' by.

8
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,451
Yeah, yeah, yeah, girls.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,553
On the beaches.

10
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,654
Girls.

11
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,755
Oh, what peaches.

12
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,856
Girls.

13
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,288
So pretty, Lord, I could cry.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,392
Yeah, yeah, yeah

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,885
I'm just a red-blooded boy.

16
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,554
And I can't stop
thinkin' about...

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,663
Girls.

18
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,764
Sailin' sailboats.

19
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,865
Girls.

20
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,966
And water skiin'

21
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,067
Girls.

22
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,502
They'll drive me out my mind,
WV. 3133/. Yay.

23
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,663
Girls.

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,138
- Big and brassy - Girls.

25
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,240
Small and sassy.

26
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,341
Girls.

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,640
Just give me one of each kind.

28
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,839
Yeah, yeah

29
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,903
I'm just a red-blooded boy.

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,005
And I can't stop
thinkin' about...

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,815
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls.

32
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,789
And when I pick up
a sandwich to munch.

33
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,623
A crunchy, crunchety,
a crunchety crunch

34
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,664
I never ever
get to finish my lunch.

35
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,166
Because there's always bound
to be a bunch of...

36
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,258
Girls.

37
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,335
In tight sweaters.

38
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,461
Girls.

39
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,537
In short dresses.

40
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,766
Girls.

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,934
A walkin' and a-wigglin' by,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:49,940
Girls.

43
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:50,941
Out boatin'

44
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,077
Girls.

45
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,045
Just a-floatin'

46
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,046
Girls.

47
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,310
So pretty, Lord, I could cry

48
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,373
I'm just a red-blooded boy.

49
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,545
And I can't stop
thinkin' about...

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,557
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!

51
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,406
I'm just a red-blooded boy.

52
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,043
And I can't stop
thinkin' about...

53
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:37,488
Girls, girls,
girls, girls, girls...

54
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,601
Captain! Captain!

55
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,559
Captain! Captain!

56
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,753
Ross! Ross! Strike!

57
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,023
Slow her down, Chen.

58
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,157
Hey! I got a strike!

59
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,232
What have you got, Mr. Morgan?

60
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,567
I don't know, but it's sure
putting up a fight.

61
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,639
Don't let it get away.

62
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,341
Oh.

63
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,884
Maybe you better give me a hand.

64
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,510
Right.

65
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,849
Watch it.

66
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,548
Yeah.

67
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,115
Okay, Mr. Morgan,
she's all yours.

68
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,918
Watch yourself.

69
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,126
What have you got, Mr. Morgan?

70
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,292
I couldn't stand
burying him at sea.

71
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,796
Arthur, let's get it straight...
You reel him in.

72
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,397
Will you shut up
and give me another Dramamine?

73
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,808
Open your mouth.

74
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,176
There you go, sport.

75
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,682
Okay, Chen.

76
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,774
Let's haul it in.

77
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,220
Okay, Chen, now.

78
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,433
Here we go.

79
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,701
Put a canvas over it, Chen.

80
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,268
Where is it?

81
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,507
It's in the bow, Mr. Morgan.

82
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,639
Oh...

83
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,911
Watch it.

84
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,713
I like the way you did that.

85
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,084
Thanks.

86
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,523
Ahoy, "Kingfisher"!

87
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,790
Ahoy, "West Wind"!

88
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,337
We'll race you, Ross!

89
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,373
For what? You know
I can't beat you!

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,374
A sailboat take
a fast sportfisher?

91
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,739
I let them win.

92
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,671
I can see why.

93
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,806
They're girls.

94
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,716
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!

95
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,232
See you at the dock, Ross.

96
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,892
It sure is a beauty.

97
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,332
Which one?

98
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,665
The boat.

99
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,829
Sharp, isn't she?

100
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,737
Oh, real yare, Jack.

101
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,070
Ross.

102
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,631
Why don't you relax

103
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,111
and come get some sun with me?

104
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,271
Uh, why don't you check

105
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,042
and see if your husband's
all right, huh?

106
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,207
No.

107
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,081
Take a look, Chen.

108
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,384
Mr. Morgan... he's sleeping.

109
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,117
That's him.

110
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,159
Don't you feel sorry for me?

111
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,493
In a way, yeah.

112
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,258
You must get a lot of this.

113
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,264
Quite a bit.

114
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,629
You'd think if nothing else

115
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,532
the fish smell
would keep them away.

116
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,161
And you want to keep them away?

117
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,500
No, no.

118
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,869
I like girls.

119
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,873
But not as much as the boat.

120
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,204
I live on the boat.

121
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,437
I'd like to own her.

122
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,876
What's Stopping you?

123
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,107
Money.

124
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,615
That shouldn't be
a problem for you.

125
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,980
You must be kidding.

126
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,746
No, I wouldn't do that.

127
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,754
I don't give
to organized charity

128
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:34,658
but there's a big charge
in doing it this way...

129
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,888
individual cases.

130
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,226
Mrs. Morgan, I
don't accept charity

131
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,560
from anybody.

132
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,464
I have to earn what I get.

133
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,626
You would, honey.

134
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,897
You would.

135
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,449
- Ross.
- Oh, hi.

136
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,618
Say, when are you going

137
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,127
to teach those daughters
of yours

138
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,253
how to stow a sail, huh?

139
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,854
- Ross...
- Mr. Morgan liked the boat.

140
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,263
He'll probably charter again
as soon as it's calmer.

141
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,461
Ross, can I talk to
you a minute, please?

142
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,528
What's the matter Papa Stavros?

143
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,867
Nothing, nothing.

144
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,478
Well, there's something
bugging you.

145
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,571
The doctor told him
a bug is bugging me.

146
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,173
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

147
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,581
Today he tells us
we have to move

148
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,882
to a dry climate, like Arizona.

149
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,683
Like Arizona?

150
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,985
Arizona.

151
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,719
Papa just learned English
so they want him to move.

152
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,023
What language
they speak there, Ross?

153
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,257
Mama, please,
this is not a joke.

154
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,266
Don't worry, Ross,
we won't move away so fast.

155
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,699
But if you're sick...

156
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,895
Sick?

157
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,405
A woman isn't as young
as she used to be

158
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,373
so everyone looks for a reason.

159
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,533
Then it's not serious?

160
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,609
Of course it's serious.

161
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,667
No, of course it is not.

162
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,802
Don't listen to him, Ross.

163
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,847
And if he tells you
he has to sell the boats

164
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:02,914
also don't listen.

165
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,111
You come to our wedding
anniversary

166
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,846
on Wednesday night

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,685
and forget about all this.

168
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,016
All right, Mama.

169
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,184
Thank you.

170
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,386
Chen, you come, too.

171
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,395
Thank you, Mama.

172
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,557
<i>Come on, Papa.</i>

173
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,397
You have made enough
trouble already.

174
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,732
Papa...

175
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,569
The "West Wind," too?

176
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,937
Yes.

177
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,420
Never let me go.

178
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,429
Love me much too much.

179
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,431
If you let me go.

180
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,433
Life would lose its touch.

181
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,526
What would I be...

182
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,332
- Hey, Sam.
- Hi, Ross.

183
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,497
How are you?

184
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,665
She'll be off in a minute.

185
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,765
Wait at the bar.

186
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,934
<i>Okay-</i>

187
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,774
Never let me go

188
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,839
I'd be so lost if you went away.

189
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,149
There'd be a thousand hours
in the day.

190
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,747
Without you, I know.

191
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,284
Because of one caress
my world was overturned.

192
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,592
At the very start.

193
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,293
All my bridges burned.

194
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,335
By my flaming heart.

195
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,170
You'd never leave me, would you?

196
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:41,578
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

197
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,880
Never let me go.

198
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:53,985
Never let me go...

199
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,670
Long time no see.

200
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,415
Not such a long time.

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,375
To what disaster do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

202
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,604
You know?

203
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,771
No.

204
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,143
Only, uh, I know

205
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,343
when old head-on-the-shoulder
Robin comes on.

206
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,909
Ah, I come here plenty
when there's nothing wrong.

207
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,078
Oh, you come here

208
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,020
when you want to sing a little

209
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,024
or cry a little on my shoulder.

210
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,218
Which is it tonight?

211
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,921
Well, I don't feel
much like singing.

212
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,861
The Stavroses are
moving to Arizona.

213
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,094
They're selling all
the fishing boats

214
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,225
and the "West Wind."

215
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,895
Good.

216
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,438
It's the only way
you'll ever get it

217
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,734
out of your system.

218
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,740
It's not that easy to get it out
of your system.

219
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,140
Losing a home
and a job all in one day.

220
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,875
It might worth it...
if you lose the dream, too.

221
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,074
Now, look, Robin...

222
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,516
my father and I built
the boat together.

223
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,711
I wanted to own it.

224
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,311
I don't call that a dream.

225
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,152
Your father is gone, Ross

226
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,521
and so is that part
of your life.

227
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,390
The worst thing
that ever happened to you is

228
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,825
when Papa Stavros bought
that boat

229
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,828
and let you live on it.

230
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,057
Oh, I can always count on you

231
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,292
to make that speech, can't I?

232
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,526
You can count on me, period.

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,193
Here we go again,
here we go again.

234
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,566
Well, what do you expect me
to do, pretend I don't care?

235
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,717
No, but don't make things
tougher than what they are.

236
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,506
You ready for your number,
Robin?

237
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,911
Let Sir Galahad do it, okay?

238
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,108
What are you doing to her, Ross?

239
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,446
Nothing.

240
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,283
Uh, he-he just came in
to tell me his troubles

241
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,254
and I told him mine, that's all.

242
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,255
It's my fault.

243
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,882
It's nobody's fault,
Sam. It's just...

244
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,017
Geez, would somebody sing?

245
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,391
Sure, Mac, sure.

246
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,056
Thanks, pal.

247
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,724
Hey, you sing, Ross.

248
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,462
Come on. Favor to me, huh?

249
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,585
I want my share of love.

250
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,283
It might as well be known.

251
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,883
But I ain't thinkin' of.

252
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,860
One girl to love alone.

253
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,627
That ain't the way it's gonna be

254
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,033
I'm on my own and I am free.

255
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,765
- And I've been satisfied.
- Been satisfied.

256
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,365
- So I don't wanna be tied.
- Don't wanna be tied.

257
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,274
Somebody's lovin' arms.

258
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,314
Can sure be sweet, I found.

259
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,247
But I want no one's arms.

260
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,479
To ever hold me down.

261
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,783
- Once I get caught inside a net.
- Ah...

262
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,053
I'm gonna run, I bet

263
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,458
- I'm gonna run and hide.
- Run and hide.

264
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:47,489
- 'Cause I don't wanna be tied.
- Don't wanna be tied

265
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,933
- I've seen others.
- Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.

266
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,039
<i>- Who were matched.
- Ba-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha.</i>

267
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,099
<i>- They thought love could stay.
- Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.</i>

268
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,439
<i>Ba-da, ha-da, ha-da-ha.</i>

269
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,343
<i>- Once they cared.
- Ba-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha.</i>

270
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,144
<i>- And got attached.
- Ba-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha.</i>

271
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,651
It seems their love
just slipped away.

272
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,653
<i>Ba, ha-ha, ha.</i>

273
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,383
- Don't want no claims on me.
- Don't wanna be tied.

274
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,085
- Don't want no chains that bind.
- Don't wanna be tied.

275
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,458
- As anyone could see.
- Don't wanna be tied

276
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,624
- I say what's on my mind.
- Don't wanna be tied.

277
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,666
Oh, there ain't nothing
I conceal.

278
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,065
Ah

279
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,230
I'm gonna play the field.

280
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,637
- The field of love is wide.
- Field of love is wide.

281
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,005
- So I don't wanna be tied.
- Don't wanna be tied.

282
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,410
- The field of love is wide.
- Field of love is wide.

283
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,381
- And I don't wanna be tied.
- Don't wanna be tied.

284
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,475
- The field of love is wide.
- Field of love is wide.

285
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,918
Oh, I don't wanna be tied

286
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,082
I said I don't-uh

287
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,320
I don't, don't, don't,
don't wanna be

288
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:54,390
- I don't wanna be tied.
- Don't wanna be tied.

289
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,436
Great. Just great.

290
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,412
Any time you want to make it
permanent, boy, let me know.

291
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,413
Thanks, Sam.

292
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,744
I'm still a fisherman.

293
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,248
What's this?

294
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,692
The, uh, swinger
with the mink look sent it over.

295
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,752
You must smell of musk
or something.

296
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,922
Excuse me.

297
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,165
I don't work here but, uh,
thanks anyway.

298
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,296
What's the matter, pal,
not enough money for you?

299
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,372
Shh.

300
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,532
Want me to have him...?

301
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,235
Aah, you sing lousy anyway.

302
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,401
Thank you.

303
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,343
Actually, I thought
you sang very well, Mr...

304
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,412
He stinks!

305
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,538
The old stinkaroo.

306
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,615
Ross Carpenter.

307
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,047
I'm Laurel Dodge.

308
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,314
Yessir, the real old-fashioned
stinkarooni.

309
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,877
Who's the intellectual?

310
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,253
A bad idea I had.

311
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,758
Blind date.

312
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,918
He's blind, all right.

313
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,519
Wait a minute, pal,
you get your own dame.

314
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,893
San'!

315
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,658
You had to call the cops,
didn't you?

316
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,295
Thank you.

317
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,040
- Robin...
- Go cry on her shoulder.

318
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,269
Now wait a minute, Robin.

319
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,208
You're Sir Galahad, all right...

320
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,042
to strangers.

321
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,652
I'm sorry I caused trouble
for you.

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,654
Hm, don't give it
a second thought.

323
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,622
Girls.

324
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,234
Now what do you want?

325
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,672
Uh, you dropped
your handkerchief.

326
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,674
Come on.

327
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,176
Well, how about,
"You got a match?"

328
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,575
Ah, cut it out.
You're not funny.

329
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,409
I just thought maybe
you'd like me to help.

330
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,278
This kind of help
I can get from my enemies.

331
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,389
Well, I wanted you to know

332
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,043
that I never saw him
before in my life.

333
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,244
Honey, I gathered that much.

334
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,913
Now you come on.

335
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,650
He said he was a friend
of my father's and he wasn't.

336
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,089
That's all there was to it.

337
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,593
Okay, I believe you. Okay.

338
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,686
Okay. Who's the girl?

339
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,027
She said she was
an old football buddy

340
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,534
of my mother's, but she wasn't.

341
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,194
Where do you live?

342
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,533
Down the road a piece.

343
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,696
Very far?

344
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,570
Not too far.

345
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,473
Let's go.

346
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,816
If you're trying to tire me out,
it's working.

347
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,873
What's the name of that church?

348
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,045
The Old Church.
Everybody knows that.

349
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,610
Not everybody where I come from.

350
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,985
I've never been here before.

351
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,082
Where do you come from?

352
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,388
Grand Rapids?

353
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,897
No. Can't we go back
and go inside?

354
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,125
Corpus Christi.

355
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,725
No. You could rest.

356
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,200
Maybe sing with the choir.

357
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,896
Prattville, Oklahoma.

358
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,563
No.

359
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,074
It's such a nice night out.

360
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,907
Wouldn't you like to go
to some other local landmark?

361
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,037
Only the one you're staying at.

362
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,912
I'll show you where I'm staying.

363
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,915
Good. Shall I call a cab?

364
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,545
Um, oh, I don't think
that will be necessary.

365
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,554
Well, if you think

366
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,249
I'm going to walk
all over this town...

367
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,850
Well, here we are.

368
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:08,926
Here?

369
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,020
It's simple and unpretentious.

370
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,689
Just reeks of history.

371
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,960
Reeks of something.

372
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,364
Good night.

373
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,334
Hey, uh, aren't you going
to ask me upstairs?

374
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,735
They double the rent for that.

375
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,864
Besides, what kind of a place
do you think this is?

376
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,702
Well, that's what
I'd like to find out.

377
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,709
Tomorrow.

378
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,777
What time?

379
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,811
Lunch?

380
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,778
Okay, I'll pick you up.

381
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,007
Where are we eating?

382
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,106
The Mariners. Would you like
to see the menu, too?

383
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,263
I'll meet you there, 12:30.

384
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,397
You don't know where it is.

385
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,942
I'll find it.

386
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,027
You're sweet, Ross.

387
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,566
Then why am I leaving?

388
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,541
Would you like a room
or, uh, anything?

389
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,580
Uh, if you don't mind parrots.

390
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,581
Parrots?

391
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,707
Yes.

392
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,151
You see, I have these
23 darlin' creatures

393
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,710
who travel with me
wherever I go.

394
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,085
Oh.

395
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,126
Of course, I always have to make
arrangements far ahead.

396
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:18,824
But the Hilton people weren't
at all understanding this time.

397
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,865
As a result, I find myself

398
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,799
and these poor, feathery
little creatures left...

399
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,531
Oh, you'll have
to excuse me now.

400
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,800
It's their dinner time.

401
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,965
I've got to go feed 'em.

402
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,338
Bye-bye, y'all.

403
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,574
Bye-bye now.

404
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,613
Bye-bye now.

405
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,681
Parrots?

406
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,315
Ross.

407
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,413
Ross!

408
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,425
Ross!

409
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,493
Yes, sir.

410
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,255
You know Mr. Johnson, don't you?

411
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,694
By reputation, yes.

412
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,324
Well, Mr. Johnson
is interested in the boats.

413
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,663
These the other boats?

414
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,761
Oh, yes, yes, and they're
in first-class shape.

415
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,328
Ross sees to that.

416
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,635
How would I know?

417
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,609
Let's shake down the
"Kingfisher" and I'll tell you.

418
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,677
Ross, he-he...

419
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,043
he wants to take a ride.

420
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,720
You're on, Skipper.

421
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,820
Hey, hey, don't
rev it up so much.

422
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,861
I don't want burned valves.

423
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,588
If I want.

424
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,392
Cast off, Papa.

425
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,210
You coming aboard, Papa?

426
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,541
No. I can't.

427
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,011
I got to stay with Mama.

428
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,175
He just doesn't want to get hot-
rodded around out there by you.

429
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,547
You know something, Mr. Johnson?

430
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,382
You may be right.

431
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,346
Okay, Captain Blood,
can we go home now?

432
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,006
Why not?

433
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,708
Think you can handle
a following sea?

434
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,909
Uh, would you like to try?

435
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:19,917
No, no, no.

436
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,510
Uh, not unless
you can get some speed

437
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,077
out of these
washing machines here.

438
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,179
You want speed, huh?

439
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,781
<i>Okay-</i>

440
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,898
Are you going to buy the boats?

441
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,730
At a price.

442
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,927
Yeah, I bet.

443
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,298
These are three top boats.

444
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,169
Three? What's wrong
with the fourth?

445
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,299
The sailboat?
What would you do with that?

446
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,139
Make like a gentleman of the sea

447
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,076
if the old man will throw it in.

448
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,341
It wouldn't look good on you.

449
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,473
I have a girl it would.

450
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,711
Who'll teach you to sail?

451
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,910
She will.

452
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,750
It's her second favorite sport.

453
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,192
Your butterflies opened.

454
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,534
Two of them.

455
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,573
Well, that's the sea for you...
Unpredictable.

456
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,234
We'll have to clean
the carburetors.

457
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,799
Excuse me.

458
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,438
This shouldn't take a good
mechanic over five minutes.

459
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,626
Will you hold that for me?

460
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,863
Keep it turned away
from you, Mr. Johnson.

461
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,198
It's a little messy, you know.

462
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,765
Ross!

463
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,471
Ross!

464
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,008
Oh, hello, Suzie Wong.

465
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,779
Oh, aren't we getting
a little repetitious?

466
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,580
Look, I came, I saw, I left.

467
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,916
I leave now.

468
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,352
You were very late.

469
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,685
I waited.

470
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:39,918
You waited long enough

471
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,720
to pick up some aging gentleman.

472
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,817
That was my father.

473
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,488
Oh, "that was no gentleman,
that was my father."

474
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,498
I'll make my own jokes,
thank you.

475
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,193
It's not funny. It's sad.

476
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,735
Well, you didn't show.

477
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,032
He was in town.
So, I called him.

478
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,937
Why am I always explaining
something to you?

479
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,132
Maybe it's something you do.

480
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,336
Look, I checked the hotel.
They never heard of you.

481
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,174
Well, you'll have
to trust me on that one.

482
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,111
Why?

483
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,443
Because I went to the trouble

484
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,381
of asking the bartender
at that nightclub

485
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,450
where I could find you

486
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,486
and because you like games
as well as I do.

487
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,214
Come aboard and play.

488
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,722
Tell me the rules.

489
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,986
I got a feeling you'd cheat.

490
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,222
That's usually what
the lady says to the gentleman.

491
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,662
I just came to mend fences.

492
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,731
Ever try canvas?

493
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,734
Can you stitch?

494
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:23,996
I kicked the habit.

495
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,833
Sit down, I'll get some coffee.

496
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,030
Save it for tonight.

497
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,334
What happens tonight?

498
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,897
You're taking me to dinner.

499
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,373
Oh, I'm taking you to dinner.

500
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,104
Good, we'll eat
at my boss's house.

501
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,373
Well, if you're broke...

502
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,914
Oh I'm not broke, I'm not broke.

503
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,845
I hope you're not
one of those men

504
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,315
who's dreary about money.

505
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,251
"We'll go where I can afford
or we won't go at all."

506
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,789
Look, it's, uh, Papa and Mama
Stavros's anniversary.

507
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,153
I'll meet you at 7:30 sharp.

508
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,090
That way you won't
have to go wandering

509
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,628
around any hotel lobbies, okay?

510
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,162
7:30 sharp.

511
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,011
What's she doing here?

512
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,710
Is the fleet in?

513
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,618
Lay off, Robin.

514
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,087
Ditto.

515
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,214
Want to come aboard?

516
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,022
I wouldn't get aboard
Cleopatra's barge with you.

517
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,993
Then what'd you
come down here for?

518
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,690
I started out to apologize
for the other night.

519
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,789
I accept.

520
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:28,799
I withdraw.

521
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,494
I didn't know you had company.

522
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,661
Robin...

523
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,295
You're a fast worker.

524
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,896
I know you're upset.

525
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,841
I'm not upset,
I'm hurt... H-U-R-T.

526
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,910
You want to be.

527
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,013
Robin, you know how it
is between you and I.

528
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,241
I don't want to hear that.

529
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,682
I know how it is between us.

530
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,720
I also know
how it could be, okay?

531
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,916
Okay. Okay.

532
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,118
You're going
to come back this time

533
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,591
the way you always do.

534
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,425
All right, Robin, all right.

535
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,489
Are you? Tell me.

536
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,694
I don't know.

537
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,102
Sir Galahad.

538
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:12,008
You're Sir Galahad, Don Juan
and Casanova rolled into one.

539
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,842
If it isn't this boat,
it's girls.

540
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,574
Girls, girls, girls.

541
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,921
And don't you follow me!

542
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,859
Sir, I wonder
if you could tell me...

543
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,659
Scat! Get out of here!

544
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,665
Get out of here!

545
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,859
Scat!

546
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,426
Scat!

547
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:50,239
An angel sent from above

548
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,909
ls Mama.

549
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,544
Mama.

550
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,854
And everyone fell in love.

551
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,655
With Mama.

552
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,287
Mama.

553
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,231
Ah, ah, ah, Mama's so sweet.

554
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,860
Mama's so nice.

555
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,595
This is really your family,
isn't it?

556
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:13,729
Whenever there's trouble.

557
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,245
- Well, sort of.
- Take Mama's advice

558
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,832
I never knew my mother.

559
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,070
- We lost her when I was born.
- No one I hold so dear.

560
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,354
And then, uh, when my dad died.

561
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,312
I-I had to sell the boat
to pay for everything.

562
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,144
- As Mama...
- So that's why I'm...

563
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,808
You don't have to explain to me.

564
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,784
- Mama...
- I'm sorry they're leaving.

565
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,312
I always want to be near.

566
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:40,390
Mama...

567
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,395
Quiet, please.

568
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,029
Quiet!

569
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,700
A toast from Linda and me
to Mama and Papa

570
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,904
for taking the trouble
to meet, marry

571
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,411
and get us born.

572
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,414
It was no trouble at all.

573
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,585
Excuse me.

574
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,756
Many happy years to you,
Mama and Papa Stavros

575
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,228
and the best of health
in your new home

576
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,525
and this is for you.

577
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,031
Thank you, Ross.

578
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,863
Ross, what do I get?

579
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,868
You got Mama.

580
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,804
Oh!

581
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,568
Thank you, Ross.

582
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,270
<i>Oh, Mama.</i>

583
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,244
Mama, now please, please,
please don't cry.

584
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,337
Don't cry, Mama, please.

585
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,414
That's no good for you.

586
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,608
But it's so pretty.

587
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,616
<i>Mama.</i>

588
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,617
Mama...

589
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,618
Oh, you spoil it.

590
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,619
It's so pretty.

591
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,348
I know it's pretty,
but don't cry.

592
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,516
Please.

593
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,662
Oh I will never forget
the first night we met.

594
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:57,299
Was love I was searching for.

595
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,675
- My heart beat faster and faster.
- Ooh...

596
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,839
- Oh so much faster - Ooh...

597
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,645
- Faster than it did before.
- Ooh...

598
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:11,121
Juntos.

599
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:16,320
We'll be.

600
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:20,331
Together.

601
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,198
Ever and ever.

602
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,864
Close to my heart.

603
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,534
You'll always be.

604
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:35,477
We'll be together.

605
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,347
And love forever.

606
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:44,150
- Nothing can change - Change.

607
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:52,222
Our destiny...

608
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,805
She's running just fine.

609
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,973
Just fine.

610
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,539
You really love
this boat, don't you?

611
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,346
Oh, yeah.

612
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,648
Why, my father and I spent

613
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,279
every spare minute
working on it.

614
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,383
We've measured and sanded and
polished every board on it.

615
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,723
You know, my dad was
a great guy.

616
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,285
You'd have liked him.

617
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,231
And then, on the day
it was finished

618
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,860
it was the day he died.

619
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,736
Somehow the boat meant...

620
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,241
Aw, I'm sorry.

621
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,833
We're getting too serious.

622
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,277
We're supposed to be relaxing,
remember?

623
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,041
It's a nice day, nice breeze.

624
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,047
Nice boy.

625
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,482
Nice girl.

626
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:51,421
When a boy like me.

627
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,892
Meets a girl like you.

628
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,760
Then I must believe.

629
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,200
Wishes come true

630
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,170
I just look at you.

631
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:12,870
And I touch your hand.

632
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:20,783
And this ordinary world
becomes a wonderland.

633
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,821
There are many girls

634
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,885
I have met before.

635
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,899
But I passed them by.

636
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:39,904
Because I knew.

637
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:44,135
There would be this magic moment.

638
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:48,771
One to last a lifetime through.

639
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,782
When a boy like me.

640
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:59,189
Meets a girl like you.

641
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,284
I like you.

642
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,192
I don't know why.

643
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,792
Let's live to find out.

644
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,562
This is KOV Marine Channel

645
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,332
repeating Coast Guard
emergency weather report.

646
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,803
Hold the tiller, Laurel.

647
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,535
Small craft warnings
have been hoisted.

648
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,544
Vessels are advised
to seek shelter areas.

649
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,946
This is KOV Marine repeating
Coast Guard weather.

650
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,878
Should we start back?

651
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,386
Nah. No, we'll go
to Paradise Cove instead.

652
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,047
Chen Yung's folks live there.

653
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,521
I'd like you to meet 'em.

654
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,867
Pretty good catch, huh, boys?

655
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,312
All right, just put them on ice.

656
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,473
Ahoy, Kin!

657
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,607
Hey, it's Ross.

658
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,209
Ahoy, Ross!

659
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,219
Ahoy, Kin!

660
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,880
Come and get us.

661
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,251
Boys, put away.

662
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,668
Good to see you, Ross.

663
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,934
We hear from number one son
Chen you got trouble.

664
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,236
Aw, small trouble, big for me.

665
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,710
Uh-huh.

666
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,611
Oh, uh, uh, Laurel,
this is Kin Yung.

667
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,080
He runs the place.

668
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,548
Kin, Laurel Dodge.

669
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,880
How you do, Miss Dodge.

670
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,317
How do you do, Mr. Yung.

671
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,651
Place not change so much,
huh, Ross?

672
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,521
Ah, place not change so much.

673
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,186
Hello, there!

674
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,456
Hi!

675
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,939
Hi. How's the water?

676
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,590
Hi. How are you?

677
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,590
Hi, Ross.

678
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,682
What a beautiful place.

679
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,693
Isn't it great?

680
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,422
What kind of fish
do they catch here?

681
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,260
Tuna, dolphin, all kinds.

682
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,732
Ross, Madam Yung fix bok choy,
lob cheong

685
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,930
Drown trouble in soy sauce.

686
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,372
What, no fortune cookies?

687
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,909
You go say hello, huh?

688
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,548
Mr. Yung's a very nice man.

689
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,674
Yeah.

690
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,393
Madam?!

691
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,020
Madam Yung?!

692
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,999
Madam?

693
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,627
Oh, hello, Mai Ling.

694
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,635
Hello, Ross.

695
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,569
- Hello, Tai Ling.
- Hello, Ross.

696
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,949
I'd like you
to meet my friend Laurel.

697
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,338
Hello, Miss Laurel.

698
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,739
Hello, Miss Laurel.

699
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,904
Hello, Mai Ling.
Hello, Tai Ling.

700
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,912
They belong to the family
next door.

701
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,540
Ross?! Robin?!

702
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,641
You better go in now.

703
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,915
Oh, not Robin.

704
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,422
Definitely not.

705
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,083
Uh, Madam Yung, this is Laurel.

706
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,387
A pretty name. Sit down.

707
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,757
You sit down, too, Ross.

708
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:57,828
Thank you.

709
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,693
String some pea pods.

710
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,825
String for your supper.

711
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,164
Ross got a new girl.

712
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,499
Shh:

713
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,699
You ever string any peas before?

714
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,366
You know this one long?

715
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,205
Forever. 24 hours.

716
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,675
Oh. No harm done yet.

717
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:14,870
How's Chen, Ross?

718
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,038
He's fine, madam.

719
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,639
Chen very fine son.

720
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,648
Very scarce.

721
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,206
Ross is adopted son.

722
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,549
Also very scarce...
except when in trouble.

723
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,884
You have to stand in line

724
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,720
if you want to lecture me,
madam.

725
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,791
Start.

726
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,894
- Me help, too.
- Yep, too.

727
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,396
Me help, too.

728
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,397
Miss Laurel, you are guest.

729
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,092
You can clean shrimp.

730
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,233
Children, dinnertime.

731
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,567
You better go home now.

732
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,731
Bye, Miss Laurel.

733
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,740
Good-bye.

734
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,071
Good-bye, Miss Laurel.

735
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,235
- Bye, kids.
- Good-bye.

736
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,243
Good-bye, Ross.

737
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,311
Good-bye, Ross.

738
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,450
Work.

739
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,407
Excuse me.

740
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,377
Here you go.

741
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,435
I wouldn't want you
to starve to death.

742
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,981
It's not very filling anyway.

743
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,413
Thank you. I've had plenty.

744
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,975
Even if you full,
you hungry one hour later.

745
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,214
You make date with Chinese girl

746
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,722
same thing.

747
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,520
One hour later,
you want second date.

748
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:38,392
Old men remember small things
very big.

749
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,896
Old Chinese proverb.

750
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,261
Dinner finished.

751
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,202
Uh... you wash dishes.

752
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:49,900
I'll show young couple
calm before storm from porch.

753
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,306
Young couple look at own calm
before storm.

754
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,866
You help wash dishes.

755
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:57,245
Honorable ancestors do not
approve of men in kitchen.

756
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,942
Use honorable detergent.

757
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,847
Ross... very pretty on porch
this time of night.

758
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,517
Shall we?

759
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,694
You'd better put
your sweater on.

760
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,863
Oh, what a beautiful view!

761
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,873
I don't know...
Looks like rain to me.

762
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,466
Help. Ah!

763
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,875
Aah... There you go.

764
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,208
I like the Yungs.

765
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,543
They like you.

766
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,549
Do they like Robin, too?

767
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,779
You know how the Chinese
<i>are...</i> inscrutable.

768
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,547
They don't express
their feelings.

769
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,851
Isn't damp air bad
for stringed instruments?

770
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,448
It could only improve this one.

771
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,390
It couldn't hurt it,
that's for sure.

772
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,258
Sing something lutish.

773
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,596
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

774
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,396
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

775
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,234
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

776
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,570
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

777
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,907
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

778
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,845
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

779
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,817
Gotcha!

780
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,682
What's so funny?

781
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,847
You sing Chinese very funny.

782
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,514
"You sing Chinese very funny."

783
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,251
Everybody wants to be a critic.

784
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,850
You think you can do better?

785
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,188
"A bee," uh, that means, uh...

786
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:29,837
<i>Ooo-ooo-ooo,

830
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,229
Too late for children to be up.

831
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,739
Run!

832
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,242
Too late for anybody to be up.

833
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,574
Do you think she's trying
to tell us something?

834
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,238
She's hinting at something.

835
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,806
I wonder what it could be.

836
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,921
You two go to bed now.

837
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,923
A man's home is his castle.

838
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,585
Kin, you sleep with
brother-in-law next door.

839
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,156
Kin doesn't like to sleep

840
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,327
with brother-in-law

841
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,302
because brother-in-law snores.

842
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,430
You go sleep with
brother-in-law.

843
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,770
Sleep well.

844
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,434
- Good night.
- Good night.

845
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,638
Ross, Laurel, you come with me.

846
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,774
Laurel, you sleep with me.

847
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,614
Ross, you on couch.

848
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,709
Good night.

849
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,379
Good night.

850
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,923
Good night.

851
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:15,592
I must have gotten
the wrong fortune cookie.

852
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,292
Laurel. Laurel.

853
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,485
Laurel.

854
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,738
Ahoy, West Wind.

855
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,364
One if by land.

856
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,807
And two if by sea.

857
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,376
We can weigh anchor, Admiral.

858
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,044
I'm ready.

859
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,248
It's not a fit night
for man nor beast.

860
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,555
It's not exactly sensational
in here, either.

861
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,890
You frightened?

862
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,555
Terrified. Let's go watch it.

863
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,927
Good idea.

864
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,506
Why is it you feel so much more
alive in a storm?

865
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,068
I don't know.

866
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,457
I guess maybe it's
because everything

867
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:41,782
seems more intense, more real.

868
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,614
This is real.

869
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,749
Yes.

870
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,419
You sound doubtful.

871
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,758
You're not too real yourself.

872
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,298
Not yet.

873
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,427
You're not married, are you?

874
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,266
Almost.

875
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,034
Is that what you're
running away from?

876
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,871
Yes.

877
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,842
Let's not talk anymore.

878
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,540
Do you still love him?

879
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,709
He didn't love me.

880
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,378
I didn't ask you that.

881
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,547
I was hurt.

882
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,716
The whole thing was such a lie.

883
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,885
What about him?

884
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,396
That's why my father brought me
here from Chicago.

885
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,056
It's over with

886
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,760
but I'm just not
all together yet.

887
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,271
You're together enough for me.

888
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,236
I couldn't stand
being fooled again.

889
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,110
It's me, and it is real,
isn't it?

890
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,589
We're getting wet.

891
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,421
Do you care?

892
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,790
I don't want to care
about anything.

893
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,829
Good-bye, Ross!

894
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,100
Good-bye, Miss Laurel!

895
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,005
- Come back soon!
- Come back soon!

896
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,008
Bye!

897
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,840
- Bye, kids!
- Good-bye, everybody!

898
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,743
Bye!

899
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,057
Papa Stavros.

900
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,058
Oh.

901
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:30,126
What are you doing?

902
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,394
I... I... I didn't expect you.

903
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,395
Hello, Miss Dodge.

904
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,463
Hello, Mr. Stavros.

905
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,192
What's the ledger for, Papa?

906
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,165
This is, uh... marine insurance.

907
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,828
You know how they want
all the gear itemized.

908
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,429
Oh, yeah, I know,
I itemized it last month.

909
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,600
Well, this is
sort of an inventory.

910
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,270
Ross, I sold the boats.

911
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,575
You sold them?

912
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,376
All?

913
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,110
Johnson said,
"Take it or leave it."

914
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,380
I need the money to buy
the house in Arizona...

915
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,013
You don't have to explain
anything to me, Papa, I know.

916
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,420
Well, I just... I go home now.

917
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,720
How soon does he take over?

918
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,692
Ross, the trouble is that...

919
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,820
I'll start getting
my gear packed now.

920
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,057
No, no, no.

921
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,862
Tonight, tomorrow, lots...

922
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,434
Good-bye, now.

923
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,137
Where will you live?

924
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,266
Chen can take me in
for a few days.

925
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:20,868
But what are you going to do?

926
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,574
Yep. I'm going to see him now,
right now.

927
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:25,648
Chen?

928
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:26,740
Nope, Johnson.

929
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,683
I'm going to take you home
first, though.

930
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,186
I'll get a cab. Go and see him.

931
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,813
Wait a minute.

932
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,290
You were going to let me
take you home, weren't you?

933
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,292
I live at 136 Bay Street,
apartment three.

934
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,452
I'll be waiting.

935
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:38,671
I don't know how long it's...

936
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,856
I'll be waiting.

937
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,144
We knock, Skipper.

938
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,805
And we take advantage
of old men in trouble.

939
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,871
This was no Greek
bearing gifts. I paid.

940
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,280
Will you sell the "West Wind"?

941
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,656
Depends. I don't own anything
that doesn't have a price.

942
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,656
How much?

943
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:08,724
Ten thousand.

944
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,420
What'd you pay Stavros?

945
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,586
Six.

946
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,152
You're a thief.

947
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,096
I'm a businessman.
You got the money?

948
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,997
Now you know
I haven't got any money.

949
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,161
Then what are you
wasting my time for?

950
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:23,070
Johnson, what'll you do
with the fishing boats?

951
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,802
Dry-dock... painting
and refitting.

952
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,311
They'll be out of
circulation for a while.

953
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,039
And so will you.

954
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,877
You want to go to work for me?

955
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:32,880
Doing what?

956
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,211
Fishing for tuna.

957
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,683
No dice, no dice.

958
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,119
But I'll tell you what
I'd like to do for you...

959
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,247
And I'll tell you what
you're going to do.

960
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,053
Get yourjunk off
my sailboat, now.

961
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,524
Whoops, hold on now, Skipper.

962
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,494
You won't get that
monkey off your back

963
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:46,620
making foolish plays.

964
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,358
Now, I don't need you...

965
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,526
Like choking up the
engine on the "Kingfisher."

966
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,002
All that did was let me
knock the sale price down.

967
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,836
All right now,
do you want a job?

968
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,136
If I go to work for you

969
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,677
will you sell me the
boat for so much a week?

970
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,542
I told you,
everything's for sale.

971
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,890
But I won't promise
I won't sell her

972
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:04,938
if I get a good offer.

973
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,346
What do you pay a boat captain?

974
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,679
Captain? Don't you think

975
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,015
you ought to go out
as a deckhand first?

976
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,748
Oh...

977
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:12,846
60 bucks a trip.

978
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,788
If you're really bucking
for the sailboat

979
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,257
you can make two trips a week.

980
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,227
Commercial boat captains
get a percentage.

981
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,855
Not if they're inexperienced.

982
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,160
Then why take a chance
an paying me a salary?

983
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,860
This way, a dry trip
won't cost you.

984
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,027
The more I haul,
the more we both make.

985
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,265
What percentage?

986
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,382
Ten percent above crew rate.

987
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,846
You're out of your mind.
Two percent.

988
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,908
- Seven.
- Three.

989
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,382
Five, and I get to look
at the books.

990
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,877
Okay, Skipper, you got a deal.

991
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,776
Chen Yung goes with it.

992
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,714
Sure, sure.
That's how generous I am.

993
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:40,716
You're real generous.

994
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:41,717
Want to drink on it?

995
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:42,945
Not unless yours is a mickey.

996
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:45,352
You know, I like you.

997
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,719
You remind me of me.

998
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,390
Aah, what are you
trying to get me to do?

999
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,449
Blow the whole deal?

1000
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,654
Be here tomorrow morning,
3:00 a.m.

1001
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,753
Oh, and, uh,
you don't have to move.

1002
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,264
You can stay on the sailboat.

1003
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,265
Oh, thanks.

1004
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,665
I suppose you want me
to maintain it, too.

1005
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,362
You will, Skipper, you will.

1006
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,546
When you're in my arms.

1007
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:18,555
And I feel you so close to me.

1008
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:26,622
All my wildest dreams come true.

1009
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,862
It's not the pale moon.

1010
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,201
That excites me.

1011
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:42,713
That thrills and delights me.

1012
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:43,803
Oh, no...

1013
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,160
I came here to talk to you, Sam.

1014
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,215
Good.

1015
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:51,415
It's just the nearness of you.

1016
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:55,049
When you're in my arms...

1017
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,217
Well?

1018
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,886
You got room for another singer?

1019
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,621
The other dame sings, too?

1020
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,994
Oh, oh, you're
becoming a specialist.

1021
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,191
I sing.

1022
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,700
I've been telling you that.

1023
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:05,826
I'm available.

1024
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,030
What made you decide now?

1025
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,539
Oh, a little matter of money.

1026
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,131
I've offered you money before.

1027
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,903
I didn't need it before.

1028
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,375
How much can I make?

1029
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,242
Mmm, scale to begin with.

1030
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:17,678
More if you're a big draw.

1031
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,512
This has nothing
to do with Robin.

1032
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,846
She stays.

1033
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,908
Of course, she stays.

1034
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,580
And, Sam, don't say
anything about it.

1035
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,714
I'll tell her tomorrow, okay?

1036
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,316
Where are you going?

1037
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,293
I got a date.

1038
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,125
There's a nice crowd here.

1039
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,857
Why don't you go on now?

1040
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,330
I can't tonight, Sam.

1041
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,425
Fishing, singing and hunting?

1042
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,732
That makes for
a pretty full day.

1043
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,739
You're going to have
to give up something.

1044
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:51,807
And to feel in the night.

1045
00:50:53,450 --> 00:51:00,413
The nearness.

1046
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:06,953
Of you.

1047
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,888
Come on, Ross.

1048
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,593
I want to see
if I made a good deal.

1049
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,569
All right, Sam, all right.

1050
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,041
Dr. Livingston.

1051
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,272
Hi.

1052
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,870
Somehow this isn't
how I imagined

1053
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,005
the big reconciliation.

1054
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,675
Uh, Robin, I was
going tell you...

1055
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,514
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1056
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,610
Those of you
who are regular patrons here

1057
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,519
know Ross Carpenter
who has sung here

1058
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,920
many times before.

1059
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,925
Tonight, Ross sings
for the first time

1060
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,426
as a professional.

1061
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,055
He'll be here regularly
from now on.

1062
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,691
Now let's all wish him
a lot of luck.

1063
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,737
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

1064
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,775
I thought you were going
to let me tell her, Sam. Thanks.

1065
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,242
Sorry.

1066
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,119
Sing it again!

1067
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,248
Sing it again!

1068
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,384
More!

1069
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,861
Return to sender.

1070
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,599
Return to sender

1071
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:21,900
I gave a letter to the postman.

1072
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,201
He put it in his sack.

1073
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,609
Bright and early next morning.

1074
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,045
He brought my letter back.

1075
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,513
She'd wrote upon it.

1076
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:36,576
"Return to sender.

1077
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,850
"Address unknown.

1078
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:44,156
"No such number.

1079
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,424
No such zone".

1080
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,058
We had a quarrel.

1081
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:54,661
A lovers' spat

1082
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,435
I write, "I'm sorry".

1083
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,101
But my letter keeps coming back.

1084
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,979
So then I dropped it
in the mailbox.

1085
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:09,349
And sent it special "D".

1086
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:12,116
Bright and early next morning.

1087
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,420
It came right back to me.

1088
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,857
She'd wrote upon it.

1089
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,386
"Return to sender.

1090
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:24,400
"Address unknown.

1091
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,461
"No such person.

1092
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,508
No such zone".

1093
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,840
This time I'm gonna
take it myself.

1094
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,472
And put it right in her hand.

1095
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,518
And if it comes back
the very next day.

1096
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,748
Then I'll understand.

1097
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,448
The writing on it.

1098
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,925
"Return to sender."

1099
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,619
"Address unknown."

1100
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,798
"No such number.

1101
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,097
No such zone".

1102
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,107
Oh, return to sender.

1103
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,939
Return to sender.

1104
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,807
Return to sender.

1105
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,447
One more!

1106
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,574
More!

1107
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,176
More singing! More!

1108
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,414
Sing it again!

1109
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,988
Ross?

1110
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,261
Ross?

1111
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:39,867
I found love
and all that I can say.

1112
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,139
Oh, I never, never

1113
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,078
I never, never.

1114
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:47,708
Never let it get away.

1115
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,274
Ah...

1116
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:53,789
Because of love

1117
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:58,260
I'm the happiest guy.

1118
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:02,287
And life is sweet.

1119
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,460
As cherry cream pie.

1120
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,630
Ooh... ooh...

1121
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:12,664
Well, Heaven and Earth
are now all mine

1122
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:17,145
I've jumped to the moon
from cloud number nine.

1123
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:22,515
Because, because, because,
because of love.

1124
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,520
Because of love, because of love.

1125
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:33,588
Because, because, because,
because of love.

1126
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,129
Sing it again!

1127
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,639
- More!
- Sing it again!

1128
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,765
One more!

1129
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,481
Robin, I was going to tell you
about it tomorrow.

1130
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,483
When you go, you go
the whole route, don't you?

1131
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,228
First you pull the rug out
from under my feet.

1132
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:57,330
Now you want to take the bread

1133
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,287
out of my mouth.

1134
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,799
Oh, you're making it
sound complicated.

1135
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,033
- Sure.
- Actually, I'm just trying

1136
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,401
to keep the wolf away
from the door.

1137
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,586
From the boat.

1138
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,992
I'm only singing for
the money to buy it.

1139
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,461
So, I'm doing two jobs at once.

1140
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,463
Mm-hmm.

1141
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,657
It doesn't affect you.

1142
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,861
You bet it doesn't.

1143
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,869
Can I go now?

1144
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,698
Anchors away.

1145
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:19,966
Night, Sam.

1146
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,772
You're a busy boy.

1147
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,836
You're not going to get
on my back, too, are you?

1148
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,033
The other one was just here.

1149
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,105
Laurel?

1150
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,173
She went that-a-way.

1151
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,452
Laurel!

1152
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,057
Laurel.

1153
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,457
People just don't
stand me up, not even once.

1154
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,790
I'm not people.

1155
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,125
And this is your second try.

1156
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,220
Wait a minute.

1157
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,789
What were you doing with Robin,
hedging your bets?

1158
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,426
I'm working there.
Sam gave me a job.

1159
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,628
Fishing? Oh, yeah. Fishing.

1160
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,694
The whole place is packed
with tuna every night.

1161
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,206
Very funny.

1162
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,484
I do the fishing in the daytime.

1163
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,188
When I'm not working
for Johnson, I'm here.

1164
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,610
When do you work at us?
Split shift?

1165
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,578
I need the money.

1166
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,513
Money isn't that important.

1167
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,710
Oh, no, not when you've got it.

1168
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,253
It's important to me.

1169
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,844
How come it's not
so important to you?

1170
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,286
I mean, it's only what you
can buy with it that matters.

1171
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,290
I have to buy the boat.

1172
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,122
He's not going to give
it to me, you know?

1173
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,128
And not much else means anything
now, is that right?

1174
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,028
That's right. Until I do buy it.

1175
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,862
I thought it was Robin.

1176
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,867
Now I almost wish it was.

1177
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:19,868
I could fight that.

1178
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,734
You don't really
understand, do you?

1179
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,739
I've never wanted
anything that badly.

1180
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,332
Well, who and what are you

1181
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,342
that let you play it this cool?

1182
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,440
Did you forget something?

1183
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,209
I'm sure she isn't cool.

1184
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,274
And she really understands.

1185
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,819
Why don't you go back to her?

1186
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,649
No comment?

1187
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,989
I'm just trying to think
of the right answer for that.

1188
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,893
Have you found it?

1189
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,397
Yeah, I found it.

1190
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,679
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling.

1191
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,776
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling.

1192
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,619
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling.

1193
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,591
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling.

1194
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,492
Fish on the table
and fish on the fire.

1195
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,907
- Dry fish hanging on the tree.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1196
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,865
Everything here
that your heart desires.

1197
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,399
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1198
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:28,096
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1199
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,868
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Thanks to the rolling sea.

1200
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,534
Living is good
and living is fine.

1201
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,341
- We're happy as we can be.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1202
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,141
We owe all this
to the salty brine.

1203
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,579
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1204
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,794
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1205
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,083
Thanks to the rolling sea.

1206
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,987
Work all day,
but our hearts our gay.

1207
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,549
And while we work we sing.

1208
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,722
The mighty sea is good to us.

1209
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,595
And we've got everything.

1210
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,156
Abalone steaks
and tuna fish cakes.

1211
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:59,429
Thanks to the rolling sea.

1212
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,233
- Taste so heavenly.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1213
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:05,240
- We know who we owe it to.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1214
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,606
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1215
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:11,113
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1216
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,047
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1217
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,262
- Thanks to the rolling sea.
- Rolling, rolling, rolling.

1218
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,345
Thanks to the rolling sea.

1219
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,091
Let's see if we have more luck

1220
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,650
catching bait than we did tuna.

1221
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,026
We haven't had much luck
catching anything yet.

1222
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,863
Where's the bait?

1223
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,302
We only got a net full of water.

1224
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,272
We haven't got enough bait
on this boat

1225
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,173
to charm a sardine,
much less a tuna.

1226
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,267
Start the engines.

1227
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,812
Let's make another haul.

1228
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,012
Head out to sea, Chen.

1229
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:52,747
Hey, kill the engine!

1230
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,722
Take it out of reverse!

1231
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:57,883
Kill it!

1232
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,519
Kill it!

1233
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,929
Kill it!

1234
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,647
Gee, Ross, I'm sorry.

1235
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,241
Yeah, well, we'll
save the pieces.

1236
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,376
Old Johnson will probably
want to count them.

1237
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,453
We go home now?

1238
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,613
Yeah, we go home now.

1239
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,214
Unless you want to jump in
and catch a tuna by hand.

1240
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,224
Oh, no. No!

1241
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,056
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1242
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,429
A lot different
than game fishing.

1243
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,061
Or shrimping.

1244
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:45,096
I used to do that
off New Orleans.

1245
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,666
New Orleans.

1246
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,542
I wish I was there right now.

1247
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,056
Saw three shrimp in the water.

1248
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:06,619
Two were old and gray

1249
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:14,696
I swam a little bit closer,
and I heard the third one say:

1250
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:19,604
Good-bye, Mama Shrimp.

1251
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,442
Papa, shake my hand.

1252
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:30,681
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me Louisian.

1253
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:34,087
Here come the shrimp boats, boy.

1254
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,854
To take me Louisian.

1255
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,758
He showed his mama and papa.

1256
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,826
Shrimp newspaper he read.

1257
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:50,601
An invitation to all the shrimp.

1258
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:54,837
And this is what it said:

1259
01:01:54,911 --> 01:02:01,783
"Free ride, New Orleans,
stay in grand hotel.

1260
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:09,315
"Meet Creole gal to help you
come out of your shell.

1261
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:15,297
Meet Creole gal to help you
come out of your shell".

1262
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:25,703
If I should live to be 90,
I will never forget.

1263
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,904
The little shrimp
and the song he sang.

1264
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:33,482
As he jumped into the net.

1265
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,144
Good-bye, Mama Shrimp.

1266
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,850
Papa, shake my hand.

1267
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:48,023
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me Louisian.

1268
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:55,504
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me Louisian.

1269
01:02:55,571 --> 01:03:00,941
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me Louisian.

1270
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,272
Ah...

1271
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:07,749
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me Louisian.

1272
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,546
Ah...

1273
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:16,685
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me to Louisian.

1274
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:23,028
Here come the shrimp boat
for to take me to Louisian.

1275
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,330
Well, I'll be a...

1276
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:28,893
How long will it take to fix it?

1277
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,904
Too long.

1278
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,701
How soon can we
get another section?

1279
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,252
I don't blame you
for being in a hurry.

1280
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:34,876
If that first trip's
a sample of the tuna

1281
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,089
you're going to bring in,
you'll have to live out there.

1282
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,548
Mr. Johnson, that's it.

1283
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:43,919
One ton.

1284
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,021
I read more.

1285
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:47,647
Maybe 20 pounds more.

1286
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:48,884
Okay, one ton, 20 pounds.

1287
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,255
How much does that come to?

1288
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,326
I don't know.

1289
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,691
I'll have to check
today's prices.

1290
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,923
Let's go to the office.

1291
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,897
You got that
trick adding machine.

1292
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,732
What's with the "For Sale" sign
on the boat?

1293
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,430
How do you get to sell a boat

1294
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,997
if you don't let people know
it's for sale?

1295
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:13,377
I thought you had a girl
who just loved sailing.

1296
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,883
That was last week.

1297
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:18,249
This week she likes
staying home, knitting.

1298
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:21,018
Ah, you're funny.

1299
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,580
Honey, what's today's price?

1300
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,888
Listen, Johnson, why do you
keep bothering me

1301
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:26,325
with the price of tuna?!

1302
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,330
Now give me the one on tuna.

1303
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,437
Thank you, honey.

1304
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:43,678
Your cut's $23.

1305
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,713
What?

1306
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,249
So, figuring $110
for a new section

1307
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,408
you owe me $87.

1308
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,576
Hey!

1309
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,382
Mr. Johnson,
do yourself a favor.

1310
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,924
Don't go without food or water
until you get it.

1311
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,525
You screamed for a percentage.

1312
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:57,592
On profit, not loss.

1313
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,389
So where's the profit?

1314
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,124
Next trip...
if I make a next trip.

1315
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,530
I got 20 bucks says you will.

1316
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,533
It's a bet.

1317
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,160
I'll show you what
kind of a guy I am.

1318
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,236
We'll call it square.

1319
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:09,705
I'll take a beating on the net.

1320
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:10,705
Not good enough.

1321
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,400
$23 and you pay
for your own net.

1322
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,475
No dice.

1323
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,566
All right.

1324
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,011
You owe me $20 on your bet
because I'm through.

1325
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:22,446
Five, ten

1326
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,680
15, 20.

1327
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,018
Skipper...

1328
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,320
21, 22, 23.

1329
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,417
You're a rough beginner.

1330
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,656
I'm learning from you, pops.

1331
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,322
I'm learning from you.

1332
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,137
Hi.

1333
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,641
Hi.

1334
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:47,904
Don't be nervous.

1335
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,534
I come as a friend.

1336
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,740
What are you all made up for?

1337
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,251
This is what the grownup
ladies wear to work.

1338
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,548
This is called a hat.

1339
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,553
Oh, a hat.

1340
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,111
I got myself a job.

1341
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,679
As what, Mata Hari?

1342
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:03,452
No, selling ladies' hats.

1343
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:06,188
There's nothing
mysterious about that.

1344
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,060
Are you still mad at me?

1345
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,622
No.

1346
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,633
How are things?

1347
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:14,227
Not too good.

1348
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,668
He's selling the boat.

1349
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,638
I know.

1350
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,142
What about that lunch
we never got around to having?

1351
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,142
I can't.

1352
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,735
I'm due at the millinery shop.

1353
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,543
Don't you think you're carrying
this a little too far?

1354
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:26,614
But there's dinner.

1355
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,878
I'd like to cook for you.

1356
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,748
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1357
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,652
You'll find out
when you taste the cooking.

1358
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,383
Do you remember the address?

1359
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,653
136 Bay Street, apartment three.

1360
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,592
And I'll be waiting.

1361
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,095
Try not to detour this time.

1362
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,891
"Try not to detour this time."

1363
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,660
Oh.

1364
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,503
Oh.

1365
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:31,906
Oh!

1366
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,091
Hello.

1367
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,251
Do something.

1368
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,259
What?

1369
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,590
The oven, it's on fire.

1370
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,221
Now, now, don't get excited.

1371
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:49,321
Whew. You got any salt?

1372
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,560
Oh, I don't use salt...
Just ground pepper and oregano.

1373
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,568
<i>Ground 989... 7?</i>

1374
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:54,899
Are you looking for the salt?

1375
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,563
No. I'm looking
for a place to hide.

1376
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:57,572
Well, if I have any

1377
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,573
it would be up there.

1378
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,234
Thanks.

1379
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,708
This is salt.

1380
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:05,179
I'm going to show you something.

1381
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,181
Oh.

1382
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,739
It's an old wives' trick.

1383
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,657
I think maybe it's a
little too well done.

1384
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,420
Now how can you say that?

1385
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,427
You don't happen to have an old
wife lurking around, do you?

1386
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,196
It's kind of a late
thought, isn't it?

1387
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,202
You never said.

1388
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,204
You never asked. No.

1389
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,330
Now this is white wine.

1390
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,535
You wouldn't happen
to have any canned shrimp

1391
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,077
or crab meat around, would you?

1392
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,873
Yes, but the dressing
I bought's supposed

1393
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,946
to go with cheese.

1394
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:42,951
Have you got any oil?

1395
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,282
Oh, I don't mind the squeak.

1396
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:45,548
Don't bother with it now.

1397
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,554
Salad oil.

1398
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,748
Oh.

1399
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,882
I have some oil I bought
from the drugstore.

1400
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:50,959
Never mind. Forget it.

1401
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,891
You see the little box?

1402
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,556
Pick it up.

1403
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,757
Atta girl.

1404
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,891
Now put it in your little hand.

1405
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,561
Come on in here.

1406
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,832
Now, light the candles...

1407
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,168
and you take off your shoes

1408
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,833
and smoke your
little corncob pipe

1409
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,535
and dinner'll be ready
in a jiffy.

1410
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,205
Papa's going to cook the dinner.

1411
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:21,856
Ow!

1412
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,222
Umm... Mustn't play
with matches.

1413
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,069
Shall we have our coffee
in the living room, madam?

1414
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,194
Please.

1415
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,263
- Cream and sugar?
- Black, thank you.

1416
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,001
Shall I drown that out?

1417
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,534
The people next door have very
far-out tastes in music.

1418
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,603
I don't know. I kind of like it.

1419
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,342
Maybe it's the way I feel.

1420
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,713
Dinner wasn't that bad.

1421
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:51,378
It's the best meal
I ever cooked.

1422
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:52,545
Ross.

1423
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,852
It's still the boat, isn't it?

1424
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,223
You think I'm a little dingy
about this, don't you?

1425
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,525
You can want a thing awfully bad
for the right reason

1426
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,224
but you ought
to prepare yourself.

1427
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,232
If she's sold?

1428
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,893
Yes.

1429
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,993
Well, the only good
thing about that is

1430
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,437
I wouldn't have to work
for Johnson anymore.

1431
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,439
Who did?

1432
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,565
You did.

1433
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:13,767
Shh.

1434
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,571
It's a fight.

1435
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,669
You're out.

1436
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,909
Well, I always said...

1437
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:23,111
They're arguing about
some bracelets he gave her.

1438
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,311
What did she say?

1439
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,650
She says if he feels
that way about them

1440
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,985
he can have them back.

1441
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,384
He got them back.

1442
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:33,759
She's working up
to bigger things.

1443
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,888
They're not fighting.

1444
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:38,263
I hope they're married.

1445
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,029
Yeah, me too.

1446
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,233
Just trying to make
them feel at home.

1447
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:50,679
These walls not only have ears

1448
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,477
they got hands, feet,
broomsticks and everything else.

1449
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:54,549
My turn.

1450
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:14,095
The walls have ears.

1451
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:18,231
Ears that hear
each little sound you make.

1452
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:23,243
Every time you stamp,
throw a lamp.

1453
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:26,577
And every cup and dish you break.

1454
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,578
But they can't hear a kiss.

1455
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:36,182
Or two arms that hold you tight.

1456
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:40,593
So come on, baby.

1457
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,860
Don't fight tonight.

1458
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,400
The walls have ears.

1459
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:54,272
Better think
before you fling that shoe.

1460
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:58,940
If you part my hair with a chair.

1461
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,142
They'll spread the news
to Timbuktu.

1462
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:06,887
But they can't hear a kiss.

1463
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:11,222
Or two arms that hold you tight.

1464
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:15,890
So come on, baby.

1465
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:18,228
Don't fight tonight.

1466
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:27,037
Jets can fly fast and high.

1467
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,238
Rockets can go even faster.

1468
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:34,909
But they can't catch
or even match.

1469
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:38,920
Sound traveling through plaster.

1470
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,581
The walls have ears.

1471
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:47,460
Ears that hear
each little sound you make.

1472
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,931
Every time you stamp,
throw a lamp.

1473
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:56,267
And every cup and dish you break.

1474
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,467
They can't hear a kiss.

1475
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,603
Or two arms that hold you tight.

1476
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:08,207
So come on, baby.

1477
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:12,686
Don't fight tonight.

1478
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:16,885
Just dim the light.

1479
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:20,418
Don't fight tonight.

1480
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,657
Ow!

1481
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:46,246
Well, hello.

1482
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:47,914
You're Mr. Johnson, aren't you?

1483
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,115
If I'm not,
I'm stealing his liquor.

1484
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:51,318
Bloody Mary?

1485
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:52,656
Laurel Dodge.

1486
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,696
Well, come in
and close the door.

1487
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,935
Won't you join me in my
sad and solitary vice?

1488
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,437
I'm touched, Mr. Johnson

1489
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,199
but I'm here on business.

1490
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,208
Oh, in that case,
I'll have this later.

1491
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,209
Sit down.

1492
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,608
I'm better on my feet.

1493
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,204
I'm told it's a must
in dealing with you.

1494
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,874
Flattery will get you
everywhere.

1495
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:14,949
I doubt it.

1496
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,213
I'd like to buy the sailboat.

1497
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,378
A lot of people would.

1498
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,889
They come here
and talk about it every morning.

1499
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,617
I'm here this morning.

1500
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,455
It's $10,000, Miss, uh...?

1501
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:26,187
Dodge. Like in Detroit.

1502
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,026
You don't have to club me.
I'm reading you.

1503
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,360
$10,000 is too much.

1504
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,797
Probably, but that's the price.

1505
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,096
I know what you paid.

1506
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,899
Everybody on the waterfront
knows what I paid.

1507
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,703
You have to want to buy her more
than I want to sell her

1508
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,641
and, uh, I'm betting you do.

1509
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:42,768
Not that much.

1510
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,813
Good. Then we can
forget about the boat.

1511
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,575
Have a little lunch,
take a drive?

1512
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,740
Seven?

1513
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,308
O'clock? Dinner?
That's even better.

1514
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,911
$8,000, that's all I've got.

1515
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,922
Would you like me to
make you a little loan

1516
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,320
till next week's allowance?

1517
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,655
The interest would be too high.

1518
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:00,092
Well, stay a while.

1519
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,926
I'm not as tough I seem.

1520
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,056
I'm sure of that,
but you're as greedy.

1521
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,191
I'm just trying
to be nice, honey.

1522
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:08,202
If you want
to sweet-talk me, Mr. Johnson

1523
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,270
do it in numbers.

1524
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,878
Temper, Miss Dodge, temper.

1525
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,209
$10,000?

1526
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,875
And you're calling me collect?

1527
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,883
No, Daddy, $2,000.

1528
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,885
I've got $8,000
in my checking account.

1529
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,512
I know, I just gave it to you.

1530
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,283
Are you in some kind of trouble?

1531
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,290
I'm just trying
to be nice, honey.

1532
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,553
Then what are you going to do

1533
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:31,559
with that much money?

1534
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:32,822
I'll tell you when I see you.

1535
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:33,895
Tell me now!

1536
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,329
You'll only start making
a big thing of it.

1537
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:39,732
Please, just deposit the $2,000
in my account and trust me.

1538
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,101
Are you sure
it's nothing... medical?

1539
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,106
<i>That's m'! 909'.</i>

1540
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,699
Is that you breathing?

1541
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,244
All right, who is he?

1542
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,437
A fisherman.

1543
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,105
A marlin fisherman?

1544
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,706
No, Daddy,
not that kind of fisherman.

1545
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:55,909
Not marlin, tuna.

1546
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:57,110
Tuna!

1547
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,619
Well, people have to eat.

1548
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,054
I'm going to write
that check now, Daddy.

1549
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:02,123
Bye.

1550
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,853
<i>Okay-</i>

1551
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:07,929
Thanks.

1552
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,494
Mr. Johnson.

1553
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,198
That must be it.

1554
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,637
You're
from Alcoholics Anonymous.

1555
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,377
You're gaping, Mr. Johnson.

1556
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,043
Uh, it's on a Chicago bank.

1557
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,173
It'll take a few days to clear.

1558
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,547
The boat can stay here.

1559
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,882
I'm not asking you
to wrap it up for me.

1560
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:32,887
Well, I, uh...

1561
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,117
You're in the big
time now, Mr. Johnson.

1562
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,589
Let's not be so shook up.

1563
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,752
That I'm saving
for someone else.

1564
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,090
Just one condition.

1565
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,220
What's that?

1566
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,889
That you don't tell
anyone I bought it.

1567
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:43,898
I promise.

1568
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,695
Now let me show you
what you bought, huh?

1569
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,791
That won't be necessary.

1570
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,146
Well, I have show
you how to sail her.

1571
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,514
I wouldn't want you
to get your diamonds

1572
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,715
caught in the rigging
or anything.

1573
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,833
Thank you,
but I'll manage somehow.

1574
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,205
How about that drink, then?

1575
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,437
To toast the new owner.

1576
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,773
It's a custom of the sea.

1577
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:59,041
I'll look forward to it.

1578
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,343
Please remember, Mr. Johnson

1579
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,440
I'm very serious
about keeping this a secret.

1580
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:04,611
Want me to sign in blood?

1581
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,279
Would you?

1582
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,473
Bring in another one.

1583
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,598
Come on, Irwin.

1584
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,268
That-a-boy, Irwin.

1585
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:29,970
Bring in another one.

1586
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,412
Hey, Chen, we're really
hitting them today, boy!

1587
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,677
Bring in another one.

1588
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,411
<i>That-a-boy, Irwin, that-a-boy.</i>

1589
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,476
Bring in another one. Yeah.

1590
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,250
Bring 'em in.

1591
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,757
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

1592
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,267
Oh, yes, we're coming in loaded.

1593
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,998
Oh, yes, we're coming in loaded.

1594
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,871
Well, hold the boat steady,
don't let it rock.

1595
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:02,672
Full speed ahead
until we hit the dock.

1596
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,475
We're heading for home,
the fishing was great.

1597
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,845
We're coming in loaded
'cause we're all out of bait.

1598
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:09,951
- Well...
- Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1599
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,110
Well, well, well, well.

1600
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,676
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1601
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:13,778
Oh, well now, yes.

1602
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:16,347
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1603
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,122
We got 'em packed
to the waterline.

1604
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,822
Some got away
but the catch was fine.

1605
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,457
Never saw such big ones,
but, man, oh, man.

1606
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,230
We're coming in loaded
just as fast as we can.

1607
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,134
- Well.
- Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1608
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,262
Well, well, well, well.

1609
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:31,965
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1610
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,166
Oh, well, yeah.

1611
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:35,005
Yes, we're coming in loaded

1612
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:38,240
I'm gonna see my baby
soon as I get back.

1613
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:41,010
Knock on her door
with my pockets packed.

1614
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,677
She'll look at me,
well, she can't say no.

1615
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,743
We're coming in loaded
so come on.

1616
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:46,845
Let's go, well.

1617
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:48,287
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1618
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,448
Well, well, well, well.

1619
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,083
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1620
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,593
Oh, yeah, well, yeah.

1621
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,891
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1622
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:57,261
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1623
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,358
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1624
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,836
Yes, we're coming in loaded.

1625
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,737
Oh, yes, we're coming
in loa-oaded.

1626
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,567
What did you do,
hijack another boat?

1627
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:12,977
Well, get 'em unloaded.

1628
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:14,174
Fast.

1629
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,082
You heard what the man said,
get 'em unloaded, fast!

1630
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,847
Sure is a happy one, ain't he?

1631
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,388
You got to say
one thing for him.

1632
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,549
He's sure a...

1633
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:24,058
He sure is.

1634
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:25,992
Weigh 'em and load 'em, fellas.

1635
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,810
That's the last truckload.
Take it away.

1636
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,510
What's that figure, Mr. Johnson?

1637
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:50,608
Gross weight.

1638
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:51,880
And that?

1639
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,251
Today's price per ton.

1640
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,882
What's that sneaky little figure
over behind the percent sign?

1641
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,619
Sliding scale differential.

1642
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:59,854
Now what does that mean?

1643
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:04,991
Well, that means your share
is $71.59 on the button.

1644
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:06,295
Your differential friend

1645
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:07,893
has thrown you a curve,
Mr. Johnson.

1646
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:10,063
I make it out
$103 on the button.

1647
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,765
Well, that's without
the sliding scale.

1648
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,840
So was our agreement.

1649
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,899
The bigger the load,
the smaller the percentage.

1650
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,341
That's standard
business practice.

1651
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,531
In what, the numbers racket?

1652
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,707
- Everyone accepts it.
- Mr. Johnson...

1653
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,306
in other words,
the more tuna I haul

1654
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:22,544
the bigger your cut?

1655
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:25,109
Now look, Skipper, I was nice
when you blew your first run

1656
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,932
don't push me.

1657
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,390
Johnson...

1658
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:30,535
I don't want you to be nice.

1659
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:31,754
I'd rather you'd be honest.

1660
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,057
$71 is pretty good pay
for a day's work.

1661
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,187
$103 is a little better

1662
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:36,856
and that's what we
agreed on, remember?

1663
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:40,197
$71.59.

1664
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,862
Count out the rest, Mr. Johnson.

1665
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,339
You just don't understand
business, Skipper.

1666
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:48,035
Johnson.

1667
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:59,714
The "For Sale" sign's
off the boat.

1668
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,449
It usually is when you sell.

1669
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,752
Who bought it?

1670
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:06,454
That's classified material,
Skipper.

1671
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,157
Pick up your money.

1672
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,140
This just came in.

1673
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,270
I know it's new.

1674
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,907
But is it really me?

1675
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,348
Oh, I think it
captures your image

1676
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,715
extremely well, Mrs. Figgot.

1677
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,811
Oh, now that one over there

1678
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,120
has just a teeny weensy
bit more élan.

1679
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:38,921
Oh, I don't think so, this is...

1680
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,495
I've always loved roses.

1681
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:45,659
Oh... Oh...

1682
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:49,193
This one is so
beautifully understated.

1683
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,705
Don't you think?

1684
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,433
Oh, absolutely muted.

1685
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,737
I'll take it.
Put it on my account.

1686
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:55,935
Yes, Mrs. Dick.

1687
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:59,947
Now. I must try...

1688
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,571
Nope.

1689
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,084
I'm sorry, we ran out of boxes.

1690
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:04,983
Oh, that's quite
all right, dear.

1691
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,181
I just love the hat.
Thank you so much.

1692
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,279
Bye.

1693
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,055
Laurel, did you know the...

1694
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,596
What is it, Ross? Where is it?

1695
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,663
It's been sold.

1696
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:16,630
It was mine.

1697
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:17,893
I know. You know?

1698
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:20,230
If you knew, why didn't you
do something about it?

1699
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:21,667
Are you just going
to stand there?

1700
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:24,017
Could we get out of here,
please, I'd like to talk to you.

1701
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,234
This is absolutely outrageous,
I will not stand for it.

1702
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,366
I'm a customer and...

1703
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,466
Oh, Mr. Peabody.

1704
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,443
I heard the sound
of conflict, Miss Dodge.

1705
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:32,241
You must be the manager.

1706
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:33,247
Yes, madam.

1707
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,044
I'm Mrs. Figgot.

1708
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,414
Now that's a name
you don't fool around with.

1709
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,510
I'm taking my coffee break,
Mr. Peabody.

1710
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,146
Oh, Miss Dodge, Miss Dodge.

1711
01:22:41,222 --> 01:22:43,020
The-The penalty
for desertion under fire...

1712
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:44,354
Mr. Peabody! Yes, madam.

1713
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:51,725
Laurel, how did you know
Johnson sold the "West Wind"?

1714
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,565
Uh, I went down to
the docks to look for you

1715
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,832
and they were just taking
the "For Sale" sign off.

1716
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:57,838
Good afternoon.

1717
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:58,916
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1718
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,374
Come with me, please.

1719
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:12,882
May I take your order?

1720
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,887
Oh, two coffees,
two salads, please.

1721
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:15,956
Okay with you? Mm-hmm.

1722
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,355
And bring the coffee
now, please.

1723
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,189
Thank you.

1724
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,195
Ross, there's something
I must tell you.

1725
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,096
The man I told you about...

1726
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,830
Well, that wasn't the
first time I've been fooled.

1727
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:29,903
With you...

1728
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,268
With me, what?

1729
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,001
With you it was different.

1730
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,373
It wasn't me before.

1731
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:38,276
It was my money.

1732
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,508
Oh, that's the mystery.

1733
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:41,913
You're rich.

1734
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:44,145
Yes.

1735
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,914
Try to live with it.

1736
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,250
Don't.

1737
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,499
You don't know what it's like.

1738
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,423
No, I don't know what it's like.

1739
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,826
You get so that you look
at every man suspiciously.

1740
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:58,696
I had to find someone
who'd love me for myself.

1741
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,132
I've been very lucky.

1742
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:04,331
Well, we've both
been lucky that way.

1743
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,272
Well, why are you
telling me all this now?

1744
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:09,538
I bought the "West Wind," Ross.

1745
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,110
Where are you going?

1746
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,150
I don't know.

1747
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,810
I'm going with you.

1748
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,355
What have I done?

1749
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:25,018
Look, when I was a kid,
after my father died

1750
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,891
I lived on what
other people gave me.

1751
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,588
Clothes that other
kids had outgrown

1752
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:29,596
that didn't fit me.

1753
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:31,223
Toys that'd broken
and thrown out.

1754
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:33,131
I even got to where I
thought the food I ate

1755
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:35,397
was given to me because
someone had finished with it.

1756
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,181
- I understand, Ross.
- No, you don't understand.

1757
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,832
You can't understand.
And you never will.

1758
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:40,568
A man has to work
for what he wants.

1759
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,906
I have a right
to do this for you, Ross.

1760
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:44,103
I love you.

1761
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:46,307
I don't take handouts
from anybody.

1762
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:48,076
I don't want to be kept.

1763
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:58,048
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

1764
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:04,088
Take me, take me, please.

1765
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:09,126
Put my heart at ease.

1766
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:13,266
Love me.

1767
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:18,836
As I love you.

1768
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,481
Aren't we out working
a little early today?

1769
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,786
You sing very well.

1770
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:33,021
Thanks. I've heard tell
you're talented, too.

1771
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:34,619
I want you to know I'm sorry

1772
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,061
about the way things turned out.

1773
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,462
Boo-hoo.

1774
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,591
If it'll make you feel
any better, we had a fight.

1775
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,431
Tough.

1776
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:43,801
Do you know where he is?

1777
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,068
You know, I ought to have
you thrown out of here.

1778
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,007
I have to find him.

1779
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,475
He does this all the time.

1780
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:52,070
He gets in a mood,
he just disappears for a while.

1781
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,672
Where?

1782
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,011
Paradise Cove.

1783
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,643
That'll be home now that
the Stavroses are gone.

1784
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:01,246
You know, I'm being
much too polite to you.

1785
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,687
I must be over the guy.

1786
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:03,757
Ready, Robin?

1787
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,224
Sure.

1788
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:06,761
Well?

1789
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,262
I would like to thank you.

1790
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,297
You'd better not.

1791
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:29,683
Too late.

1792
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:30,877
I already got my drink down.

1793
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:32,180
May I use that man out there?

1794
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,253
I'll pay you for him.

1795
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,221
That all depends.

1796
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,882
You want to rent him,
or buy him?

1797
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,187
I want him to sail
the "West Wind" for me

1798
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:39,259
to Paradise Cove.

1799
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,524
Oh, I... I couldn't
possibly spare him.

1800
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:43,641
There must be somebody
in this boat yard you can spare.

1801
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:46,066
There's only one man
this business can spare.

1802
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:49,104
That's me.

1803
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,695
I'm sure of that.

1804
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:54,003
I'll take you.

1805
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:56,043
How much?

1806
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:58,078
It won't cost you a dime.

1807
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:00,114
Just what do you expect from it?

1808
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:01,410
Dinner Saturday night.

1809
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:02,950
And that's all?

1810
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,951
I don't have to push.

1811
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:06,714
I know I'm irresistible.

1812
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:09,814
Oh.

1813
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,450
When can we start?

1814
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:13,585
I'll get my hat and go with you.

1815
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,033
Ed, stand by to cast off.

1816
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:22,399
Yes, sir.

1817
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:33,713
Make yourself comfortable.

1818
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:35,442
I've always heard that sailboats

1819
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:37,211
needed sails to sail.

1820
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:38,878
They do.

1821
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,354
You didn't tell me
this had an auxiliary.

1822
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:42,890
You didn't ask.

1823
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,391
Well, I could have
done this myself.

1824
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,655
I've been had.

1825
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:48,127
Not yet.

1826
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,789
I think your eyes
are a little bigger

1827
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:52,424
than your stomach, Mr. Johnson.

1828
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:07,340
Guests don't work, Ross.

1829
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:08,849
This one does.

1830
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,851
We'd better get it finished.

1831
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:14,353
Radio says Paradise Cove
will have heavy rains

1832
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:15,422
the next few hours.

1833
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,857
Oh, they did, huh? We find out.

1834
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,858
Kapu! Kapu!

1835
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,952
K3-pu!

1836
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,266
There you are, my little kitty.

1837
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:28,325
That's the first time I ever saw
a cat come when he's called.

1838
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,871
He must know he's gonna be fed.

1839
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,565
No food. He tells weather.

1840
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,573
It's gonna rain.

1841
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,200
I heard it on the radio.

1842
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:37,244
What they know about weather?

1843
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,043
Oh, I suppose Kapu knows.

1844
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:42,981
White spots in eyes if rain.

1845
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:46,112
No spots, no rain.

1846
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:51,358
No spots, no rain.

1847
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,191
You'd better stow this gear
if you don't want to get it wet.

1848
01:28:56,898 --> 01:29:00,300
Very dangerous animal
when contradicted.

1849
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,247
Oh, oh!

1850
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:19,685
Oh, uh, terribly sorry.

1851
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,347
I'll bet.

1852
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,049
Chen.

1853
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,286
Chen!

1854
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,591
Yes. Sir?!

1855
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:29,858
Do you see anything?

1856
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,591
Yes, sir!

1857
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:32,861
Fish?

1858
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:35,800
No, sir!

1859
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:36,962
Captain! Hey, Captain!

1860
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,733
Fish off the starboard bow!

1861
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,433
Fish off the starboard bow!

1862
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:46,613
Oh. Thank you.

1863
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,945
You're very kind.

1864
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:04,788
This is WY two-seven-six-eight.

1865
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:07,392
Calling marine operator. Over.

1866
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,232
This is the marine operator.

1867
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:10,737
Shh:

1868
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:14,139
Come in, WY two-seven-six-eight,
come in.

1869
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,643
Get me Paradise Cove.

1870
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:18,076
Kin Yung house.

1871
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:19,341
Emergency.

1872
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:28,187
Ross, you stop now.

1873
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,781
Save strength for party.

1874
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:30,790
What party?

1875
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:32,451
Big catch, big party.

1876
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:33,824
Aah, I'd rather work.

1877
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:35,863
I don't feel much like a party.

1878
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,694
You will, Ross.

1879
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:40,826
Plenty wine, plenty girls.

1880
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:42,563
Not interested.

1881
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:43,934
Whew. It's hot.

1882
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:47,336
So true. Sun is out.

1883
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:50,867
Okay, okay, the cat
was right, wasn't he?

1884
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:54,779
Should be. Very hep cat.

1885
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,578
Ross! Ross!

1886
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:57,743
What, madam?

1887
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:01,153
Call for you
from number one son!

1888
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:02,587
Okay, I'll be right there!

1889
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:03,954
Be back in a second.

1890
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,703
Chen on telephone.

1891
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:22,709
Ship to shore.

1892
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,108
This is Ross, Chen.

1893
01:31:24,178 --> 01:31:26,112
What's your location? Over.

1894
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:29,616
About four miles south
of Paradise Cove.

1895
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:32,517
We passed the "West Wind"
just now.

1896
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:35,056
Laurel Dodge is on it. Over.

1897
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:37,250
So what? She bought it. Over.

1898
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,759
Johnson's on it, too.

1899
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,760
It doesn't look good, Ross.

1900
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:42,262
What's he doing on...?

1901
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,094
Never mind. Thanks, Chen.

1902
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:45,165
Thank you, madam.

1903
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,600
Come on, Kin, let's get
in the skiff, come on.

1904
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,295
- What's up?
- I'll tell you later!

1905
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,425
Step on it, Kin.

1906
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:13,517
What's all the rush?

1907
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:15,722
Laurel's on the "West Wind"
with Johnson.

1908
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:16,729
Where?

1909
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:18,891
About a half a mile out,
straight ahead.

1910
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,866
All right, I step on it.

1911
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,536
Why don't you let go of me

1912
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,738
and put this boat
back on course?

1913
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:34,076
Well, don't worry.
She's on automatic pilot.

1914
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:36,310
Open her up, Kin, open her up!

1915
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:37,909
You want to fly, Ross?

1916
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:39,520
If we can, yeah.

1917
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:41,578
Okay, we fly.

1918
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,920
Now we're flying, Ross!

1919
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,827
Now I'll ask you a question.

1920
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,161
What's so special
in Paradise Cove?

1921
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:55,294
You know what I think?
Ross Carpenter.

1922
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:56,928
What about Ross Carpenter?

1923
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,200
I think you bought this boat
for him

1924
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:02,208
or you bought him for this boat.

1925
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:05,211
Now, there's boy
on a man's errand.

1926
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:08,408
Now take it easy. Relax.

1927
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:11,952
I see 'em!

1928
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:21,591
Hi. Skipper!

1929
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:25,866
Just pull up alongside them!

1930
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,837
Welcome aboard.

1931
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:34,841
Ross!

1932
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:36,809
Get off the white horse,
Skipper.

1933
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:38,276
You've got it all wrong.

1934
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:41,111
Stop it, Ross.

1935
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:45,385
Stop it!

1936
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,887
Relax and enjoy it, Miss Dodge.

1937
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:47,887
You can't stop him.

1938
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,081
Come on, get up. Get up!

1939
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:50,089
You finished?

1940
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:51,090
No, I'm not finished.

1941
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:52,091
Yes, yes, yes, you are.

1942
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,524
You haven't got the heart
for it.

1943
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:55,084
I'll tell you what
you're gonna do.

1944
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:57,062
You're gonna to buy
this boat back from her.

1945
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,223
Am I, Miss Dodge?

1946
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,698
If he says so.

1947
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:00,859
I say so.

1948
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,027
For you, anything.

1949
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:03,400
Like I said.

1950
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:07,404
Kin!

1951
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,569
Come on out and get us!

1952
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:15,014
Bring it in closer, Kin.

1953
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:18,516
Okay, Jump-

1954
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:50,884
He still reminds me of me.

1955
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:13,972
You know something?
I should win a medal.

1956
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,167
What for?

1957
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:18,212
For being the world's
biggest jackass.

1958
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,043
Well, say something.

1959
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:23,379
Okay. You're the world's
biggest jackass.

1960
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:25,681
No. I thought the only
thing in the world

1961
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:28,222
that could make me happy
was owning the boat.

1962
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:29,222
But it isn't.

1963
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,689
I'm over it, I'm over it.

1964
01:35:30,758 --> 01:35:32,089
I love you anyway.

1965
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,388
Hey, I'll tell you what.

1966
01:35:33,461 --> 01:35:35,395
We'll build a new boat.
You and I.

1967
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,899
Is that a proposal
or a proposition?

1968
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:42,163
Well, either you marry me
or live with me in sin.

1969
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:45,001
Couldn't I have
a little bit of both?

1970
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:48,868
Oh, no.

1971
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:51,435
Oh, no.

01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:03,449
I'm just a red-blooded boy.
