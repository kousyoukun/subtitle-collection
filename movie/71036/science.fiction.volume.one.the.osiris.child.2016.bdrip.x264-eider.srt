2
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,768
<i>(Indi) My father always said</i>

3
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,189
<i>that you could never trust a person
that needed something from you.</i>

4

(Grunts)

5
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,855
<i>But he also said he'd never met anyone</i>

6
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,024
<i>who didn't need something from someone.</i>

7
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,078
<i>Perhaps that's why he
never showed his hurt.</i>

8
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,708
<i>Maybe why he ran away
from all of his problems.</i>

9
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:04,963
<i>All I know is that somewhere along the path
he lost his purpose.</i>

10
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,055
<i>Which is why I traveled
to the ends of the universe.</i>

11
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,384
<i>To find him again.</i>

12

13
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,143
(Wind howling)

14
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,443
<i>Dad's accident happened
on an earlier combat mission</i>

15
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,116
<i>he led in the Trinity system.</i>

16

- (Jet whooshing)
- (Explosion)

17
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,611
<i>His mistake was simple,</i>

18
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,779
<i>but resulted in the death</i>

19
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,365
<i>of nearly all of his crew.</i>

20
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:24,004
<i>On his return to Earth, Dad was accused
of negligence through substance abuse,</i>

21
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,674
<i>but the findings were inconclusive.</i>

22
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,305
<i>Due to his decorated
career as a fighter pilot</i>

23
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,511
<i>- he was pardoned of the case.
- (Engine humming)</i>

24
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,054
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

25
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,229
<i>He was never the same.</i>

26
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,305
<i>Our family was never the same.</i>

27
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,403
<i>(Kane) You know, you decided
to come out here, remember'?</i>

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,151
<i>You wanted to come here.</i>

29
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,657
I didn't come to come here,
I wanted to see you.

30
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,576
Well...

31
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,661
I'm seeing you now, right?

32
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,376
Do you miss home?

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,422
This is home.

34
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,048
No, I mean real home.

35
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,763
Earth.

36
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,055
No.

37
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,016
No, I love it out here.

38
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,514
Mom says you're just running away.

39
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,711
Yeah, well, I haven't spoken
to your mother for a long time.

40
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,207
She doesn't know what's going on out here.

41
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,278
True.

42
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,171
(Kane) It's not every day you get to be
part of something new.

43
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,538
I'm making history out here.

44
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,288
We're building an entirely new world
from the ground up.

45
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,787
Pretty crappy world so far.

46
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,589
(Kane) All right, you know what?
Let's take a detour.

47
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,132
Got something I think you'll like.

48
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,574
(Kane) I say we call that one a hit.

49
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,264
No way, Dad. One more, I can do it.

50
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,116
We don't have time.
We've gotta get moving. We're late.

51
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,392
Come on. One more, please.

52
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,060
- Last one?
- Last one.

53
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,395
(Flies buzzing)

54
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,570
OK, hand it over.

55
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,036
Then we've got to go inspect this bunker.

56
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,238
Does this bunker have visor games,

57
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,744
or a hot tub or maybe a bowling alley?

58
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,073
It's a bunker. It's got supplies and food.

59
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,075
That would be boring.

60
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,080
God, I hate these flies.

61
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,984
Know what we call 'em out here?

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,958
Spies. You know why?

63
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,630
Enlighten me.

64
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,011
Cos they're space flies.

65
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,430
(Chuckles)

66
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:45,479
Get it? Exor brought 'em out
on a cargo ship and they're in space...

67
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,157
Why do we even need safety bunkers
when everything's already safe?

68
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,604
Oh, it's just Exor protocol.

69
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,656
You know, sometimes, there's an accident

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,500
or something unexpected
and we need a safe place

71
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,276
to get the General and the dignitaries.

72
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,944
Why are they so important?

73
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,617
Because in times of crisis,
we need leadership.

74
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,165
(Flies continue buzzing)

75
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,494
Otherwise, it just becomes anarchy.

76
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,713
- Anarchy?
- Yeah. You know, chaos.

77
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,794
Disorder.

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,884
People going crazy.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,304
- Oh, like zombies.
- Yeah, kind of like zombies.

80
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,677
- Got it?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,471
- Keep that shoulder relaxed.
- Yep.

82
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,357
- Focus on your breathing.
- Mmm-hmm.

83
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,560
- Which way did you miss last time?
- Right.

84
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,232
So, which way you gonna aim this time?

85
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,030
(Indi) A little left.

86
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,029
- What's the wind doing?
- I... I got it.

87
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,868
You got it?

88
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,362
You sure?

89
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,988
- Squeeze it...
- (Fires)

90
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,489
(Kane) Whoa!

91
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,498
Ha-ha! That's my girl!

92
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,333
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Good shot.

93
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,335
Best... shot... ever.

94
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,711
Best teacher ever.

95
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,586
OK, next stop, bunker.

96
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,014
And then I have to drop you back in the
city. Got Rominja coming to stay with you.

97
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,721
Dad, I don't need a nanny.

98
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,845
Why can't I stay up in
the Flotilla with you?

99
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,389
(Kane) Because the Flotilla
is a military base.

100
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,393
And trust me, it's even
less fun than a bunker.

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,897
But I'll be back in a week.

102
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,278
And you know you can call me
any time, right?

103
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,968
I'm just gonna be up there in the clouds,
right above you.

104
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,863
(Men shouting indistinctly)

105
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,033
(Indi) Do all those
prisoners get paid to work?

106
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,243
(Kane scoffs) Paid? No.

107
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,679
No, they don't get paid.
It's called reform.

108
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,705
They work to pay back
their debt to society.

109
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,391
(Indi) How do you know
when they've done enough?

110
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,715
(Kane) Those types of people,
they could never do enough.

111
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,798
(Thunder cracking)

112
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,804
<i>(Man on radio)
Anybody! Can anybody hear me?</i>

113
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,056
<i>It's coming toward us
and the prison is breached!</i>

114
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,596
<i>It's out of control!</i>

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,314
<i>Whatever these things are,
they killed everything in their path!</i>

116

Travek, what's the time?

120
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,004
- (Travek) Time to get up.

<i>(April) Kane, the deal with Indi
going out there</i>

<i>was that you actually spend
quality time with her.</i>

<i>just for the day, and I
have all the details</i>

160
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,027
<i>but I know you want to sign off on
everything, so, we waited for you.</i>

161
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,532
<i>(Indi) She waited for you.</i>

162
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,699
<i>(Rominja) Oh, and I think your new
neighbours are moving in.</i>

163
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,613
<i>I heard somebody in there yesterday.</i>

164
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,451
<i>They have a young boy.
So, that should be quite fun for Indi.</i>

165
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,536
- (Indi) <i>Boys</i> are so annoying.
- That's my girl.

166
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,464
<i>Oh, and Dad, Mom also called.</i>

167
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,543
<i>She wanted to talk to you about some
Europe trip her and her new boyfriend,</i>

168
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,130
<i>Todd, are thinking of.</i>

169
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,450
(Feed scrambles and terminates)

170
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,052
Who the hell is Todd?

171
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,091
<i>(Travek) I can't answer that, sir.</i>

172
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,059
Travek, restore the feed. Now.

173
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,219
<i>I</i> cannot.

174
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,622
<i>All communications to the surface</i>

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,223
<i>- have been temporarily disrupted.
- (Sighs)</i>

176
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,235
That is helpful.

177
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,621
We have an ETA
on when they're coming back up?

178
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,568
<i>Not at this time, Lieutenant.</i>

179
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,073
<i>But I assure you</i>

180
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,902
<i>we are doing our very best
to rectify the problem.</i>

181
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,160
Yeah, I bet you are.

182
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,783
Travek, send an Ingram to my daughter
as soon as you can.

183
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,956
Tell her, of course, she has my permission
to go on the excursion

184
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,580
and you will forward my indent today.

185
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,127
Travek, do we have any more information
on the disturbance at the prison?

186
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,010
<i>Not at this time, sir.</i>

187
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,920
Travek?

188
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,176
<i>Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

189
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,761
Find out everything you can
on this Todd guy.

190
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,974
<i>Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

191
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,273
<i>(Indi) In the race to colonize
new planets,</i>

192
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,034
<i>Exor was the undisputed leader.</i>

193
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:37,455
<i>Trusted by the hundreds of millions
who lived and worked under its rule.</i>

194
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,952
<i>Which is why the General
could never let them know</i>

195
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,792
<i>of the project she'd
been assigned to oversee</i>

196
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,794
<i>in the prison far below.</i>

197
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,977
- (Automated voice) Secure <i>line playback.</i>
- (Recording plays)

198
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,104
(Man) <i>It's coming toward us
and the prison is breached.</i>

199
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,630
<i>It's out of control!</i>

200
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,345
<i>Whatever these things are,
they've killed everything in their path.</i>

201
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,027
<i>I don't know what the
hell is happening here,</i>

202
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,644
<i>but the goddamned prisoners are out.</i>

203
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,521
<i>They are out. These things are everywhere!</i>

204
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,640
(Man screams)

205
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,524
<i>(Automated voice) End transmission.</i>

206
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,229
<i>(Indi) In the only time I ever met her,</i>

207
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,907
<i>she told me my name reminded her
of the state she grew up in.</i>

208
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,159
Indiana.

209
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:21,409
<i>I should have known then that she was more
concerned with her own place in the universe</i>

210
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,914
<i>than the people who actually lived in it.</i>

211
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,217
(Colonel Michaels)
General, the outer cities are gone.

212
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,713
These creatures are going to
kill everything on the surface

213
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,680
and this is our responsibility now.

214
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,679
We created them.

215
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,600
This is coming to the point
where we won't be able to turn back.

216
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,020
If you were in my position, Colonel,
how would you resolve this?

217
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,854
Ethically?

218
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,241
We save as many people as we can

219
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,530
and then tell the truth.

220
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,195
If our involvement in
this were known it would

221
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,739
cripple the company.

222
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,419
The fallout would destroy
generations of sacrifice and legacy.

223
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,256
How long can we honestly maintain
this Comms blackout?

224
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,593
Command won't get wind of it
for a couple of days.

225
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,881
By then, we should
have the situation resolved.

226
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,056
Resolved?

227
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,723
This isn't a maintenance issue here.

228
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,725
It's a population in the hundreds
of thousands.

229
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,560
Our people have families down there.

230
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,101
Millions of lives are at stake

231
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,230
if public outrage shuts down this company.

232
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,241
If we're found out,
what's the worst they can hit us with?

233
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,659
Genocide.

234
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,455
And, while that would be
only one of the charges,

235
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,910
(Inhales) it would be the one
that sticks forever.

236
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,997
The one that our grandchildren
remember us by.

237
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,756
We must not fail.

238
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,805
Of course.

239
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,474
(Exhales)

240
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,310
Call the meeting.

241
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,439
(Wind howling)

242
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,197
(General Lynex) I regret to report

243
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,535
that we are now considering
that the prison has been breached.

244
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:26,033
The prisoners are in possession
of a lethal Etholanide virus.

245
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,832
We've been informed that any attempt
by us to intervene in any way

246
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,298
or extract any person
or persons from the surface

247
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,969
will be met with the release of the
pathogen into the Capital, Osiris.

248
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,514
(Kane) Sommerville, Kane.

249
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,554
<i>- (Travek) You sound distressed.
- Listen to me.</i>

250
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,807
I need to get a message to Indi
by whatever means possible. Can I do it?

251
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,471
<i>Not at this time, sir.</i>

252
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,526
I want a tag on every single person
at this table for the next 23 hours.

253
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,233
Any unusual movement, isolate them.

254
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,148
Colonel.

255
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,739
This could work.

256
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,468
(Kane) Here's what I need. I need a marked
timeline on all incident reports

257
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,712
from the Capital and the prison every day
for the last seven days. Can I do that?

258
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,711
<i>(Travek) That information
is now classified.</i>

259
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,209
Classified under what jurisdiction?

260
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,881
(Door alarm beeping)

261
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,885
(indistinct announcement over PA)

262
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,689
For the sake of our friendship,

263
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,866
I'm going to tell you the truth.

264
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,016
After that, it's on you.

265
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,441
Most of what you just heard was a lie.

266
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,737
There is no virus.

267
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:45,279
The prisoners are in possession
of a lethal Etholanide virus.

268
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,505
(Secretary Millan) That's preposterous.

269
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,032
Etholanide is comparable
to a grade-six bioweapon.

270
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,545
It can't even be certified to transport
here, let alone be housed inside a prison.

271
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,206
The prison facility
has a classified research arm

272
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,587
to help fight and prevent disease
on emerging planets.

273
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,211
- So, we grew it here?
- Yes, we grew it.

274
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,611
Five years ago, we did build a facility inside
the prison, but it wasn't for research.

275
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,142
We were breeding a beast called a Ragged.

276
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,729
The idea was to contain these beasts
until there were enough of them

277
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,408
and ship them out of there and use them
in the creation of new colonies

278
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,810
to kill or assimilate indigenous species.

279
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,148
Our prisoners have commandeered
three local supply freighters

280
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,608
and are demanding safe passage
out of the system.

281
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,663
That virus has the potential
to kill all colonies in this galaxy.

282
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,250
By duty of order,
a stage-six threat must invoke

283
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,410
Protocol 84.

284
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,422
Protocol 84 requires
an entire decimation of colony.

285
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,588
However, when the prisoners become aware

286
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,761
of our obligation to invoke the protocol,

287
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,509
I believe we will have

288
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,263
a strong position to negotiate
a more favourable outcome.

289
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,969
There is no hostage situation.

290
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,766
Eight hours ago,

291
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,478
the Raggeds broke free from the enclosure,
and there's carnage in the city.

292
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,352
They're moving toward the Capital.
Kane, it's out of control.

293
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,029
Have they supplied us with a deadline?

294
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,448
We have 23 hours, 11 minutes.

295
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,504
- (Colonel Michaels) It's a cover up.
- (Watch beeping)

296
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,327
<i>In 23 hours, we're gonna blow the reactors.</i>

297
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,288
To them it's just collateral damage.

298
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,790
A mining strip, couple
of cities and a prison.

299
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,793
Every single person on that surface
is there because we put them there.

300
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,173
Because of this organization.

301
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,311
- The General is well aware of the situation...
- (General Lynex) Lieutenant.

302
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,305
I'm aware you have a little girl
alone in the Capital.

303
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,635
You moved me out here

304
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,971
and you knew all along
that this was going on?

305
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,770
The chances of this happening are
so minute, I'm not even going to...

306
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,532
- (Shouts) You let me move my family here!
- I'm not going to argue, OK?

307
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,309
Trust me when I tell you
that we're looking at every angle here.

308
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,025
And I believe that we are gonna
come out of this just fine,

309
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,897
as will your families

310
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,325
and all the other folks down there
on the surface.

311

They're going to lock down the hangar bay

You're her only hope, Kane.

You got a gun pointed at you.

358

So, why don't you tell
me what you're doing,

359
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,293

Not up there.

I'm not a prisoner, but I am a dead man.

If you keep sitting here
like this, so are you.

366
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,409
Now, am I supposed to
take that as a threat?

367
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,037
No, it's not a threat. It's a fact.

368
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,287
We've got just under 22 hours
before this place becomes a dead zone.

369
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,109
You talking about the creatures?

370
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,667
What creatures?

371
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,175
You tell me your problems,
I'll consider telling you mine.

372
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,476
There's a hostage situation at the prison.

373
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,488
The inmates have control
of the nuclear reactors.

374
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,792
They're threatening to blow 'em.

375

If they do, it's going
to happen in 22 hours.

376
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,981
Is that what they told you up there?

377
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,944
Cos I was there when that riot happened.

378

Sector 2 Ward Nurse.

379
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,072
Now, I know for a fact
that there's no one left in that prison.

380
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,954
So, either they're lying to you,
or you are lying to me.

381
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,497
I am no threat to you.

382
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,308
So, how about we forget
this ever happened...

383
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,584
Sit down!

384
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,378
You can't make it on your own.

385
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,547
Not with those things out there.

386
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,803
Well then help me!

387
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,811
Because sitting here
getting to know each other isn't working.

388
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,103
You want my help?

389
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,647
What can you do for me?

390
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,158
Why don't you tell me
what exactly is out there?

391
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,502
Why don't you offer me something?

392
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,104
We have 22 hours left

393
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,065
before they blow up this entire planet.

394
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,946
You said that. Good luck.

395
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,201
You're gonna need it.

396
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,950
I have to save my daughter!

397
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,996
She's 11 years old,
and she's alone in the Capital.

398
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,582
Help me!

399
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,175
If I don't get there, she will die.

400
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,891
And I guarantee that no one
up there gives a shit

401
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,723
about anybody down here.

402
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,074
And?

403
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,159
I have access to a military grade
safety bunker.

404
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,540
You help me get to the Capital,

405
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,039
you help me find my daughter,

406
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,633
I will give you refuge.

407
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,096
How's that for an offer?

408
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,889
You're gonna have to trust me on that.

409
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,308
It's tough down here.

410
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,274
Trust has to be earned.

411
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,696
I don't have time for that.

412
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,989
(Sy) Hey.

413
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,113
Hey!

414
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,075
You want the Capital, right?

415
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,581
Osiris is that way.

416
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,419
You need to go east.

417
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,472
OK.

418
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,107
Nice jacket.

419

(indistinct announcement over PA)

00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:43,394
Every day, I find one of these hairs

429
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,899
in my meal.

430
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,325
And I know where it comes from.
I know the Warden

431
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,991
he goes into the kitchen

432
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,414
and he takes one of his hairs

433
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,038
and he puts it in my food.

434

All right.

Carmel's serving solitary. He has the key.

439
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,649
You guys remember his drawing
from last week, right?

440
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,890
Yeah.

441
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,434
The only part missing

442
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,683
is getting the hexon filament,
divert it from the emergency release.

443
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,352
You actually understood all of that?

444
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,486
Didn't he say we needed a conduit
of some kind?

445
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,780
Yeah. That part's simple.

446
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,403
Our socks. The cotton fibres.

447
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,118
- That's it?
- Any one of us could do it.

448
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:37,619
Carmel also lost his mind
on that last stint in solitary.

449
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:41,703
Gentlemen, we need to question
the validity of this information.

450
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,709
He might have been jacking off
onto that lamp post for all we know.

451
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,085
Quiet.

452
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:53,176
Besides, we can't even
get inside the spectral tubing.

453
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,677
It's pressure sealed.

454
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,929
We can't even get to the filament.

455
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,263
We can't get to it. So, why are
we even talking about this, huh?

456
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,143
Carmel's already gotten into one.

457
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,687
Undetected.

458
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,110
- Bullshit.
- No.

459
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,063
That's why we need to move. Now.

460
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,614
Before they discover that.

461
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,490
Which Cell?

462
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,118
He doesn't know.

463
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,120
(Laughing)

464
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,240
He doesn't know. They all look alike.

465
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,622
- He doesn't know?
- (Charles) Of course he doesn't know.

466
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,998
He's insane.

467
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,337
(Plate clatters)

468
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,549
Insanity is a very common affliction
around these parts.

469
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,634
(Sy) This is our only shot.

470
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,970
We just need every solitary cell full.

471
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,553
It's the only way to ensure
that one of us is in the right one.

472
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,392
Then we get free.

473
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,687
Get access to the system via the guard post

474
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,690
and trigger the emergency release
to all the cells.

00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,072
Is Bostok's group still in?

476
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,697
(Sniffs)

477
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,082
They remain decidedly undecided.

478
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,255
(Kreat laughing) Of course, of course!

479
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,880
Cos any way you think on
it, it's a suicide run.

480
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,382
You hear that? Suicide.

481
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,883
They just want more time.

482
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,178
(Kreat muttering)
More time, more time. More time for what?

483
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,472
(Warden Mourdain)
Well, well, well, Mr Carmel.

484
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,774
What is it about solitary

485
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,103
that you love so much, hmm?

486
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,032
Is this yours?

487
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,030
Looks like you're already
ahead of the game.

488
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,496
I find, in here many turn to God

489
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,833
in a desperate realization that their life
has no meaning any more.

490
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,342
So, they pray to a fictitious idol

491
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,761
and tell themselves they're forgiven

492
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,431
as a way to deal with the guilt
of what they've done.

493
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,012
But that's all up here.

494
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,516
Because in reality

495
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,973
if there's a heaven, there
must be a hell, too.

496
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,817
And while I don't believe in any of that

497
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,280
it's still my job to make
good on the idea of it.

498
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,278
So, have faith.

499
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,702
Have faith that this place will become
your own personal hell.

500
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,996
(Laughing)

501
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,754
Maybe you think this is my first stint
in a place like this.

502
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,725
My first time dealing

503
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,305
with a limp-dick loudmouth like you.

504
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,691
I do.

505
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,438
(Chuckles derisively)

506
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,236
Because there's nothing like this place
anywhere else.

507
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,076
We don't even exist under UNSI law...

508
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,251
Am I supposed to care

509
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,623
about any of this?

510
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,749
(Exhales)

511
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,756
Yes, you are.

512
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,004
But you don't.

513
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,676
And that's why you're here.

514
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:26,431
There'll be no more solitary
for you, Mr Carmel.

515
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,148
Do you understand?

516
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,199
(Groaning)

517
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,580
You think I didn't have a hard life?

518
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,500
You think I didn't have
the same choices you did?

519
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,458
- (Groans)
- Get him up!

520
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,124
The next time you see me,

521
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,798
you show me some goddamn respect!

522
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,592
- (Grunting)
- (Groaning)

523
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,389
Get this maggot out of here!

524
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,091
Straight to the lower cages.

525
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,518
(Chuckles)

526
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:21,152
You know how many guys go into solitary
and they don't come back?

527
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,779
How many boys we lost, huh?

528
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,408
How many boys don't come back?

529
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,009
But, Kreat, let me ask you something.

530
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,624
How long is your sentence?

531
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,830
Fifty-seven years left.

532
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,913
In this place.

533
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,170
Look, brother,
you're never getting out of here.

534
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,002
Vim and I,

535
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,678
we're never getting out of here.

536
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,347
Unless we do something about it.

537
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,093
(Vim) It's now or never.

538
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,686
It's dark and day.

539
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,263
It's the same

540
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,939
shit stinking soul.

541
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,146
Kreat?

542
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,028
Please.

543
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,189
Bostok's in.

544
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,701
Are you in, Vim?

545
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,072
Let's burn this place to the ground.

546
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,999
(Laughs)

547
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,002
(Sy) I need you two to rally the troops.

548
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,963
Don't leave me hanging.

549
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:27,969
- (Thuds)
- (Grunting)

550
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,967
(Inmates clamouring)

551
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,155
<i>(Genera Lynex on speaker)
Good day to you, Warden Mourdain.</i>

552
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,396
And you, General Lynex.

553
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,825
<i>I was just hoping to get
your thoughts on the latest report.</i>

554
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,897
<i>This progress seems quite astounding.</i>

555
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,729
Well, we are dealing
with some exceptional source material.

556
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,282
And my staff are extremely passionate
about making this work.

557
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,657
<i>Photosynthetic skin shrouds.
Regenerative limbs.</i>

558
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,416
<i>At this rate, we'll be looking at our first
deployment in a matter of months.</i>

559
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,455
There are certain qualities that seem
evident in the top spectrum of the report.

560
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,792
(Clamouring continues)

561

this level of success?</i>

(Alarm blaring)

563
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,851
<i>Is there a problem, Warden?</i>

564
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,107
Nothing I can't handle.

565
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,689
We'll chat soon. Bye-bye.

566

- (Yelling)
- (Groaning)

567
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,990
Let him go!

568
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,287
- (Clamouring stops)
- (Inmate) Yeah!

569
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,876
(Nimal) I'm gonna kill
this cockroach on my own.

570
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,516
(Guard <i>on speaker)
Sir, there's</i> a <i>problem in the mess hall.</i>

571
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,838
Yes, I know.
Tell the guards to stand down.

- (Spits)
- (Tooth clatters)

573
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,095
I didn't think you and I had a problem, Sy.

574
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,345
(Smacks lips)

575
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,680
I was just hoping for a date.

586

(Guard 1) End it!

587
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,311
(Guard 2) Step back.

588
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,076
(Warden Mourdain)
Don't let me stop you, Mr Lombrok.

589
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,450
You wanna prove your place in here?

590

Let's see what you got.

- Guards!

<i>(Over speakers)

00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,579
This one also.

639
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,626
Mr Lombrok.

640
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,042
We're going to have to sedate you.

641
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,136
I have a feeling you could really
hurt yourself down here.

642
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,061
(Kane) Tell me something.

643
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,356
What's a ward nurse doing
with a military issue assault rifle?

644
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,239
I hope you know we aren't going
to make it to the Capital on time.

645
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,071
Not on foot, we won't.

646
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,407
Am I missing something?

647
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,954
(Kane) Just beyond those mountains
is a contraband outpost.

648
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,460
(Sy) What's your plan once we get there?

649
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,416
(Kane) Figure that out when we get there.

650
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,212
What do you know
about these creatures, huh?

651
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,680
Down, now! Down!

652
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,604
(Whooshing)

653
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,564
They looking for you?

00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,153
Yeah.

655
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,334

(Kane) I was hoping for
a greater selection of vehicles.

664
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,422
Haven't seen one of those
clunkers for a while.

665
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,258
(Sy) You guys know about these places
and you don't shut 'em down?

666
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,011

You know whose bus that

00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,463
Why?

677
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:30,840
Cos we need a ride.

Oh, no, I wouldn't go over there.

You're gonna wanna wait till they're done,

683

otherwise you ain't leaving here at all.

They're whacked out of their minds.

688
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,704
Have a drink.

Of course.

I like helping people.

You know, most of the people
I've helped in my time

700
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,533
turned out to be assholes.

701
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,040
(Bill) And that is your opener!

702

- (Kane) You find that?
- (Grunts)

703
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,252
Not in the moments that count.

Well, you're a better man than me.

705

What's your name, abdominal?

My name is Kane.

Kane?
Nah, you're not from around here, huh?

734

I may need you to top that off.

735

No, right now, I'm a very,
very long way from home.

You make the perfect couple.

You belong on a magazine cover, don't you?

744

But you don't belong out here, huh?

745

You take the bar lady home.
You don't take him home.

750

Mmm-hmm. Thank you very much.

That's all you had to do. Bring me a drink.

I'll pay you 10 grand one way...

760

That ain't worth spit.

761
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,885
You got a knife to your throat

762
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,554
and you're still trying to talk turkey?

763

Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

764

He's a defector of Exor.

765
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,643
He's just trying to get back to his family

Yes, it is.

769

- Cut his throat.
- No!

770
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,867
You wanna pay me 10 grand for that?

771
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,202
- Ten fuckin' grand?
- No, no, no, no, no!

772
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,162
He's lyin' like a tombstone.

773
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,869
I thought I heard him say 20.

774
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,461
He did say 20.

775

(Softly) Twenty.

- Hey, that bus outside looks modified.
- (Bill) Mmm-hmm.

781
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,350
Is that armour up to spec?

782
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,728
Why you askin'? We gonna get shot at?

783
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,059
We like to travel safe.

784
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,569
I mean, we're talkin' about
no old prison bus here.

785

We're talkin' about Gracie, aka...

Yeah.

788
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,747
You can come inside my Momma,
and she will take care of ya.

789
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,501
Twenty grand. One way. Got a deal?

790
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,545
Mmm...

791
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,746
(Kane) Let's go.

792
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,586
Not yet.

793
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,130
You wanna ride with me?

794
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,424
Wanna ride in my Momma?

795
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,889
You gotta take a kiss on this.

796
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,300
(Bill) Take a knee.

797
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,642
OK.

798
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,891
Lasts 20 seconds.

799
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,308
You get the knife on the board,

800
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,650
then we got ourselves a deal.

801
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,192
(Inhales deeply)

802
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,576
That'll make you dizzy.

803
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,749
(Grunts)

804
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,751
(Man whistles)

805
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,842
(Woman) Oh, yeah!

806
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,003
(Woman cheering)

807
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,633
(Gyp) Well, look at you, Sparky.

808
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,178
Got a bit of snap in that garter, huh?

809
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:08,887
You got talent.

810
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,560
Got yourself a deal! Whoo!

811
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,760
We're gonna need some guns.

812
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,409
- (Bill) Guns?
- So, we are gonna get shot at?

813
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,401
Just like I said, we like to travel safe.

814
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,863
- So, we can stop by Hopper and Mandel.
- (Chuckles)

815
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,566
- But it'll cost ya.
- Cost ya.

816
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,961
How far is this place?
How far to the Hopper and Mandel place?

817
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,737
Oh, no, no, it's not that far.

818
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,165
It's like about 30 minutes there and back.
Close enough.

819
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,708
(GYP) Yeah.

820
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,371
You wanna keep swapping spit
or should we hit the road?

821
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,655
(Gagging)

822
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,898
(coughing)

823
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:16,879
(Metal clangs)

824
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,792
(Door whirring)

825
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,300
(Snarling and growling)

826
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,722
(Metal clanging)

827
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,599
(Snarling)

828
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,678
(Footsteps approaching)

829
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,139
(Growling)

830
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,231
(Gasping)

831
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,314
(Growling)

832
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,530
(Sniffing)

833
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,332
- (Roaring)
- (Screaming)

834
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,958
(Distant screaming)

835
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,299
(Breathing heavily)

836
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,718
(Grunting)

837
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,355
(Ragged roaring)

838
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,064
(Warden Mourdain) Do you know
what terraforming is, Mr Lombrok?

839
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,232
It's the act of making
a hostile environment

840
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,697
habitable for humans.

841
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,237
(Ragged roars)

842
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,076
Unfortunately, many planets have indigenous
species that refuse to cooperate.

843
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:40,417
We needed a more cost-effective way
of exterminating them.

844
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,592
I'm telling you this
because I need you to understand,

845
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,257
very clearly,

846
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:51,470
what you have a chance to be a part of.

847
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,054
(Roaring continues)

848
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,307
Our friend next door
just met one of our all-star team.

849
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,773
(Vim screaming)

850
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,477
- (Continues screaming)
- (Ragged growling)

851
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,071
Many of them your former prison inmates.

852
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,982
And hopefully,

853
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,366
his constitution withstanding,

854
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,287
he'll soon be able to join them

855
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,501
and become something he was unable to do

856
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,453
as an inferior human.

857
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,247
- (Roaring)
- (Screaming)

858
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,376
(Screaming continues)

859
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,845
A being capable of evolution...

860
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,798
(Ragged growling)

861
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,382
Adaptation,

862
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,436
even in the hardest of environments.

863
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,931
(Grunting)

864
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,602
(Growling)

865
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,233
I've seen what it takes
to survive the change.

866
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,401
Don't fight it.

867
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,232
Don't fear it.

868
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,492
Allow yourself to be the manifestation

869
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,793
of the monster that I know
lives inside your soul.

870
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,212
(Footsteps approaching)

871
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,419
Surviving this next period

872
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,626
will push your mind further
than it's ever gone before.

873
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,178
And that's when you need
to remember that this

874
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,599
is a second chance.

875
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,101
Take solace in that.

876
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,480
(Gasping)

877
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,526
Guards!

878
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,907
- Bostok?
- (Sighs)

879
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,203
- You did it!
- We gotta move.

880
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,591
- (Sy) ls this everything?
- (Bostok) Yeah.

881
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,413
- Where are the IDs?
- Here.

882
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,586
- Got you a special one.
- Nurse?

883
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,305
You don't want to know
what I did to get that.

884
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,706
(Kreat) I opened the cells!

885
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,211
(Cackling)

886
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,214
- There were these other doors and... And...
- What?

887
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,011
(Stuttering)

888
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,885
(Gasping)

889
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,180
- What?
- What?

890
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,725
I let the devil loose.

891
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,603
- (Growling)
- (Screaming)

892
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,647
Guards! Report back.

893
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,569
- (Growling)
- Go, go, go!

894
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,152
(Men screaming)

895
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,241
Go!

896
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,743
(Growling)

897
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,913
- (Growling)
- (Men screaming)

898
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,152
(Bostok) You're telling me Vim's gonna
turn into one of them?

899
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,346
(Kreat) All I know
is what I saw on the monitors.

900
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,057
(Bostok) We've got to
get to Osiris before dark.

901
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,479
Come on, let's go.

902
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:45,473
I can't go with you guys.

903
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,399
What?

904
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,854
What are you talking about, man?

905
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,198
We gotta stay together.

906
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,192
(Growling)

907
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,243
Easy. Easy, easy.

908
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:04,916
Easy, boy.

909
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,710
What you gonna do, huh?

910
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,380
Where you gonna go, Sy?

911
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,333
- I'm going to the opera.
- (Laughs)

912
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,756
The what?

913
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:18,802
No, baby Sy, you don't wanna go to
the opera. They sing at the opera.

914
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,808
Don't you turn your back to me, Sy.

915
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,894
(Sy) Good luck.

916
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,273
Let him go. You and me.

917
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,276
You're gonna die out there.

918
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,105
(Growls)

919
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,440
(Warden Mourdain) I made you.

920
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,074
I made you.

921
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,860
(Growling)

922
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:41,533
- (Screams)
- (Growls)

923
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,574
(Distant roaring)

924
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,873
Bye, Vim.

925
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,545
(Distant clamouring)

926
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,793
Bye, Vim.

927
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:01,803
(Helicopter blades whirring)

928
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,278
<i>(Lamar) Normally you'd get 20 years
in a local secure max.</i>

929
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,319
Maybe out in 15.

930
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,911
But <i>I</i> highly doubt that.

931
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,208
Despite

932
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,377
all our best efforts

933
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,546
they're going to paint
you as being a monster.

934
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,712
They're gonna emphasize the breach of code,

935
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,051
betrayal of trust that the public grants
to someone in your position.

936
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,641
They're going to make
an example out of this.

937
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,185
Eye for an eye, and all that.

938
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,730
I wish I had better news.

939
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,018
It doesn't matter.

940
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,066
Nothing does any more.

941
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,035
(Metal clinking)

942
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,180
(Kane) Hey.

943
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,264
These guys reliable?

944
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:31,521
Nope.

945
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,310
(Beeping)

946
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,870
Who's paying?

947
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,998
Me.

948
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,043
(Hopper) Not too happy
about that Exor jacket.

949
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,041
We don't much like your kind.

950
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,671
How much?

951
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,478
Mandel says no deal.

952
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:13,685
Fuck.

953
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,270
Well, how about you ask Mandel

954
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,902
exactly what number's
gonna make him happy?

955
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:36,996
Thirty Gs.

956
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,253
(Gun cocks)

957
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,008
Thirty's fair.

958
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,719
Thirty. Deal.

959
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,846
Deal.

960
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,182
(Chuckles)

961
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,727
(Beeps)

962
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,771
(Chimes)

963
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,319
May I ask where you're all headed
with this kind of hardware?

00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,366
Yeah, you can ask.

965
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,862
I was just being polite!

1023
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:41,012
in less than 12 hours,
this whole place could be wiped.

1024
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,015
Every living thing.

1025
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,686
We'll all be dead.

1026
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,448
Yeah, that's right.

1027
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,842
(Bill) Throw in those damn monsters
you're describing,

1028
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,186
this place don't look anything
like it did in the brochure.

1029
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,877
(Sy) You ever wonder
how you end up where you do?

1030
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,422
You have all these plans...

1031
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,756
Make so many plans and yet...

1032
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,387
Here we are.

1033
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,724
No, not really. I know
exactly how I got here.

1034
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,061
Talking about fate, Sy?

1035
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,226
Talking about astrology and shit?

1036
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,485
I don't believe in fate.

1037
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,442
<i>Just consequence.</i>

1038
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,611
(Bill) Oh, that's right, square jaw.

1039
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,488
Live with no regrets. Can't ever go back.

1040
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,908
Hindsight's only to help you move forward.

1041
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,744
Well, I regret coming to
this shithole planet.

1042
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,915
(Chuckles)

1043
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,078
What's so funny about that?

1044
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,503
I love it here.

1045
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:56,167
That makes two of us,
my cherry pie with cream on top.

1046
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:59,127
Got wide open spaces, clean air.

1047
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,439
- Food that don't come from a laboratory now.
- Mmm.

1048
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,680
That's paradise.

1049
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,929
Momma used to say people don't change.

1050
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,141
Only their version of the past does.

1051
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,191
I say "Give a man a match,
he'll be warm for a minute.

1052
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,578
"Light him on fire,
he'll be warm for the rest of his life."

1053
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,603
Right.

1054
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,778
That's right.

1055
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,984
What about you, Abdominal?

1056
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,325
(Beeping)

1057
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,366
You dig this place? You dig the frontier?

1058
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,953
I liked it a lot better 24 hours ago.

1059
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,374
(Bill chuckling)

1060
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:32,373
But it's a fresh start and
that's what I needed.

1061
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,869
That, and I couldn't get
any further away from Earth.

1062
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,632
Bet they pay you well up there.

1063
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,469
In that... In that Sky fleet.

1064
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,804
Yeah, it pays okay.

1065
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,146
Mind you, for that career I...

1066
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,397
I got a failed marriage

1067
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:57,478
I got a shoulder that is never gonna heal,
and I got daughter that I hardly know.

1068
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,848
But yeah, the money's great.

1069
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,692
Well, our folks kicked us out.

1070
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,912
So, we had no choice
but to do something a little drastic.

1071
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:08,826
Your folks?

1072
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,492
You guys

1073
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,666
are related?

1074
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,868
That's right.

1075
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,495
She's my little stepsister.

1076
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,205
Mmm-hmm.

1077
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,007
That's why we don't look the same.

1078
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,592
(Gyp) That's why we don't kiss the same.

1079
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,930
Ooh, Sparky, that's turning you on.

1080
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,719
My little sugar Kane.

1081
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,515
What's your area up there?

1082
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,058
What do you mean?

1083
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,522
What do you do up there?

1084
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,183
I was in charge of infrastructure.

1085
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,854
Overseeing the growth
of the cities and surrounds.

1086
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,778
Everything. You know, like, uh,

1087
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,200
Capital,

1088
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,576
the mines, prison.

1089
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,703
You mean slave labour camps.

1090
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,908
Prison colonies changed
deep space exploration forever.

1091
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,124
The only way these frontiers grew so fast
is through mandatory labour.

1092
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,418
We wouldn't be here otherwise.

1093
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,883
That might be
a good talking point at one of your

1094
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,301
weekly meetings up there...

1095
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,887
But those prisoners,

1096
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,553
beyond what I personally thought of them,

1097
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:11,093
they came to me wrecked.

1098
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,059
Worked way beyond any humane point.

1099
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,774
We used to drive for the prison
when we first got here.

1100
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,899
What we saw was pretty bad.

1101
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,398
Least they're doing something useful.

1102
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,737
Prison's supposed to be hard.

1103
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,989
It's punishment, right?

1104
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,908
It's a big choice to turn your back
on everything you once stood for.

1105
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:37,995
You got a family, Sy?

1106
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,252
You got a family? You got kids?

1107
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,294
(Exhales)

1108
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,672
Then you wouldn't understand.

1109
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,971
(Bill) I gotta say it.

1110
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,520
Phew! What if your
daughter ain't there, huh?

1111
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,769
Huh?

1112
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,357
She'll be there.

1113
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,438
And then you take us to the bunker
and we'll be safe there?

1114
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,864
One hundred percent?

1115
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,027
Yeah, you have my word.

1116
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,695
Just as soon as my daughter is safe.

1117
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:13,951
Even if she ain't.

1118
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,792
Yeah, even if she ain't.

1119
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,121
Well, we gonna be one big happy family.

1120
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:22,880
I'm gonna be an uncle.

1121
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,299
It's gonna be fun. (Chuckles)

1122
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,475
(Sy) Hey, Bill, how long till Osiris?

1123
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,116
(Bill) Ah, it's probably gonna be
a couple more hours, square jaw.

1124
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,485
But don't worry, we got plenty of time
to shoot us some critters.

1125
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,648
No one messes with old Billy boy.
Gonna be fun!

1126
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,361
(Explosions)

1127
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,701
- (Growls)
- (Gasps)

1128
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:03,205
Holy shit! There's a huge
snapping turtle attacking Momma.

1129
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,581
(Growling)

1130
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,332
(Gunfire)

1131
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,508
(Crackling and hissing)

1132
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,759
(Gunfire)

1133
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,638
My apartment's right above us. Third floor.

1134
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,055
Damn, stop hitting my goddamn bus!

1135
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,234
Bill and Gyp, you protect Momma.
Sy, you come with me.

1136
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,350
(Bill) You gotta go!

1137
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,184
(Bill) All right boys! It's now or never.
Let's get going!

1138
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,438
Whoo-hoo!

1139
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,942
Hey, you know there's a chance
she's not up there or worse.

1140
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,221
If that happens, we're straight back here.
You got it?

1141
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,029
Yeah, I got it.

1142
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,529
Kane, I hope you find her.

1143
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,452
Go get your daughter, Abdominal.

1144
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,576
All right, we'll cover you.
Let's go, Gyp. Move!

1145
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,291
(Growling)

1146
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,869
- (Bill) Let's go, Gyp!
- Go, go, go!

1147
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,046
Get your asses out here, boys! Come on!

1148
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,375
(Gunfire)

1149
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,550
(Growling)

1150
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:50,877
Let's go!

1151
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,724
Get the door! Go!

1152
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,561
- (Grunts)
- Power's out. Use the stairs.

1153
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,894
(indistinct)

1154
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,237
- (Gunshot)
- (Screams)

1155
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,315
- (Man) You stay out of our stairwell.
- (Alarm blaring)

1156
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,820
Ozmin, is that you?

1157
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,072
(Ozmin) What?

1158
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,653
Ozmin, it's Kane from upstairs.

1159
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,238
How do I know that?

1160
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:22,458
Oh, it's Kane from 38!

1161
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:23,997
You seen Indi, or Rominja?

1162
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,579
Well, uh, I checked.

1163
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,670
There was no answer.
They haven't come through this way.

1164
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,093
Whole damned world's near gone mad.

1165
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,729
I have someone with me.
We're gonna come up, okay?

1166
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,426
Well, it's not my stairwell.

1167
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:36,931
You pay rent, too.

1168
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:38,971
(Kane) That's very kind.

1169
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,601
(Sy) Keep safe.

1170
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,352
And aim lower.

1171
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,145
Come on!

1172
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,313
- (Growls)
- Aha! Got you, little turtle!

1173
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,686
(Shrieks)

1174
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,483
(Laughs)

1175
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,781
Damn!

1176
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,034
Shit! (Grunts)

1177
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:06,960
(Kane) Indi!

1178
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,004
Stand back!

1179
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,123
(Gunshots)

1180
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,505
(Grunting)

1181
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,301
(Distant gunfire)

1182
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,566
Kane.

1183
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,324
(Indi) Dad?

1184
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,324
Dad, I'm here!

1185
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,247
- Dad, I'm here!
- Honey!

1186
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,744
(Gasping) I love you.

1187
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:47,661
- (Indi sobbing)
- You OK?

1188
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,139
Rominja told me to hide in there
and not come out until you came.

1189
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,380
Oh, honey.

1190
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:52,836
Where's Rominja?

1191
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,213
Uh...

1192
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,593
She's gone home.

1193
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,763
- She's not here.
- OK.

1194
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,181
(Indi sobs)

1195
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,008
Kane, we gotta go.

1196
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,517
- Yeah.
- Who's that?

1197
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,437
(Kane) That's our friend, Sy.
He's a good man. He's gonna help us.

1198
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,764
But you have to come with us.

1199
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,690
You need to stay right next to me, OK?

1200
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,860
And we're gonna be fine
but we have to run now.

1201
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,728
(Sobbing)

1202
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,696
- (Growling)
- Kane!

1203
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,526
We gotta go. Go, go, go! Come on!

1204
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,365
(Ozmin shouting)

1205
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,788
(Indi) What is that?

1206
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:24,910
(Growling)

1207
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:27,708
(Gunfire)

1208
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,293
Move, move!

1209
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,914
(Gyp sobbing)

1210
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,962
(Door opens)

1211
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,057
(Gyp) Bill, where do we keep the meds?

1212
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,105
(Sobbing)

1213
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,409
No! No, no, no!

1214
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,288
(Sobbing)

1215
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,122
(Grunting)

01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,576
(crying)

1217
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,666
Go, go, go!

1218
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,766
(Indi) Dad, Dad, where are we going?
There's nowhere to go!

1219
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:58,962
- Now what?
- (Gunfire)

1220
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,964
I don't know. Let me think. Indi!

1221
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,128
Indi!

1222
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,013

- (Thuds on door)

1223

'Dad!
'(Growling)

1224
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,141
Dad, there's a bus down there!

1225
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,642
We can make it.

1226
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,727
Gotta jump.

1227
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:12,059
Hey!

1228
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:14,140
- Come here.
- No! No, it's too high! Sy!

1229
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,566
- (Indi screams)
- Sy!

(Grunting)

Indi, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

1237
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,142
- Stay down, stay down, stay down.
- Bill! Gyp!

1238
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,668
- (Banging)
- Open the hatch!

1239
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,006
Open it!

"(Growling) 'Open it!

(Kane) Come on. Come on.

01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,111
- Get her.
- Got her.

1248

(Kane) Grab her. Take her!

1249

You okay? You okay?

1253

- Let's go! Stay down.
- (Indi sobbing)

Drive!

Gyp!

1256
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,415
Gyp, we've gotta move now!

1257
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,587
(Engine starting)

1258
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,883
(Kane) You understand
everything I've just told you

1259
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:57,251
about the creatures,
about the people I worked for.

1260
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,333
About everything that's
happening out there.

1261
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,752
This is important to me.

1262
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,250
I do, Dad. I understand.

1263
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:10,010
I'm sorry for being the crappiest,

1264
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,433
crappiest father.

1265
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,771
And I'm sorry that things
didn't work out with your mother.

1266
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,269
I loved her.

1267
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,026
I loved her so much. I still love her.

1268
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,192
And I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you growing up.

1269
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,776
And I'm sorry that I didn't get
to come to your games.

1270
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,778
Your softball games,

1271
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,285
and your soccer games
and your singing practice.

1272
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,707
It's OK.

1273
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,502
I'm so sorry I never came
to any of that, because I think

1274
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,797
you are amazing.

1275
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:48,378
(Sniffling)

1276
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,213
I need to know you forgive me.

1277
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,681
(Whimpering) Of course.

1278

(Signs)

1279
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,307
If we get through this,
it's gonna be different.

1280
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,681
I promise you, it's gonna be different.

(Breathing heavily)

1282
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,006
(Kane) Gyp, about a mile up the road,
we're gonna take a right.

1283
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,421
The bunker's in an old
abandoned mine shaft.

1284
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,257
And stay alert.
Those creatures could be anywhere.

1285
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,598
There's a code on the door. It is 14286.

1286
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,723
- Sy, you get that?

- What's it doing?
- It's watching us to see where we're headed.

Gyp, keep going straight.
Don't take the turn.

Indi, stay down, please!

(Nurse 2) She's haemorrhaging.
Call the surgeon's team.

1450
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,265
Kiara.

1451
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:23,433
(Beeping)

1452
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,448
(Nurse 3) We have a situation here.

1453
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,033
(Dr Curruthers) Nurse Lombrok,
please leave the room.

1454
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,606
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Baby, stay... Stay with us.

1455
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:30,769
Stay with us.

1456
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,489
It's my wife. Can you hear me?

1457
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,626
(Dr Curruthers) We will do everything we
can to save her, but you can't be here.

1458
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,948
- (Jandi) Sy...
- (Sy) Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

1459
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,412
(Jandi) You have to come with me.

1460
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,915
(Whimpering) I love you.
I love you so much.

1461
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:46,334
I love you.

1462
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:47,804
(Dr Curruthers)
We have some haemorrhaging here.

1463
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,421
- Sy, you have to go.
- (Gasps)

1464
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,307
If you can hear me, sweetheart,
squeeze my hand.

1465
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:52,503
Squeeze his hand.

1466
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,459
Please, honey.

1467
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:00,116
- (Dr Curruthers) We're losing her.
- (EKG beeping rapidly)

1468
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,849
Where's my daughter? Where...

1469
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,147
ls she the one that...

1470
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,434
ls she the fatality, too?

1471
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,488
- I'm so sorry...
- Where's my daughter, Jandi?

1472
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,814
Where's Kai?

1473
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:17,216
Where's my baby girl? Where's Kai?

1474
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,817
I'm so sorry.

1475
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,117
Let me go get someone to talk to you.

1476
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,456
(Beeping)

1477
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,665
(Gasps) No.

1478
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,883
(Dr Curruthers) Asystole! Commencing CPR!

1479
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:38,841
On, baby.

1480
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,565
<i>They're gonna make an example out of this.</i>

1481
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,363
Eye for an eye,

1482
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,406
and all that.

1483
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,330
- (Thuds)
- (Grunting)

1484
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:19,716
- (Taser Zapping)
- (Groans)

1485
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:37,066
(Indi) <i>My father always said
that you could never trust a person</i>

1486
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:39,406
<i>that needed something from you.</i>

1487
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,409
<i>But he also said he'd never met anyone</i>

1488
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,362
<i>who didn't need something</i>

1489
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,080
<i>from someone.</i>

1490
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,414
<i>I say we are what we are</i>

1491
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,588
when we need to be.

1492
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,082
(Man) Well, there's the beacon.

1493
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:04,798
Do you recognize that?

1494
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,263
(Woman) Looks like an old model.

1495
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,401
(Man) Must have been manually activated.

1496
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,074
There's gotta be someone here.

1497
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,920
(Woman) That means we're gonna
have to do this the hard way.

1498
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:28,618
(Man) Well, there's a bunker close by.
Let's start there.

1499
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,909
- (Woman) I'm going to go and get the kit.
- (Man) Yeah, okay.

1500
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:34,119
(Woman) Whitmore.

1501
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:35,795
(Whitmore) Yeah?

1502
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,418
It's a kid.

1503
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,425
(Woman) Stay there. We'll come and get you.

1504
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,798
- (Thuds)
- (Groaning)

1505
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:49,634
(Growling)

1506
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:53,980
(Roaring)

1507
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:06,989
(Taps on helmet)

1508
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,468
There was a large ship.

1509
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,129
The Flotilla.

1510
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,343
It used to orbit here.

1511
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:28,890
Where has it gone?

1512
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:33,137
It's en route to Earth.

1513
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:36,182
It was recalled after the disaster.

1514
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:39,021
Tell me what they said happened here.

1515
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,978
(whimpering)

1516
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,691
They... They just said that

1517
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:52,657
the prisoners revolted
and they sabotaged the reactors.

1518
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,539
There was a meltdown.

1519
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,505
How many survivors were there?

1520
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:03,170
None.

1521
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,086
At least, that's what we thought.

1522
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,720
Do you want to die out here?

1523
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:14,891
I don't wanna... I don't wanna die.

1524
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:18,390
Then you will take us to the Flotilla.

1525
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:22,061
You will ensure that we
enter undetected, or...

1526
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:25,067
It will cost you your life.

1527
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,732
(Growls)

1528
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,073
All right.

1529
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,029
OK.

1530
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,128
(Engine starting)

1531
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,142
Sy.

1532
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:42,850
We're going home.

1533
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,663
Goodbye, Dad.
