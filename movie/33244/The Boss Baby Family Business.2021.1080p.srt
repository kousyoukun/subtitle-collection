
1
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:58,188
寶貝老闆2　家大業大

2
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,190
時間是一個有趣的東西 

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,233
當我還是小孩時…
一 

4
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,943
．．．日子悠長 歷歷在目 
二 

5
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,320
躲起來!躲起來!躲起來!
三 

6
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,946
但是這些年…等等!在這裡 

7
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,281
．．．平淡無趣 歲月如梭
四 

8
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,158
五 六 
提姆,不許偷看 

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,493
是的,沒有偷看 

10
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,952
不知不覺…
七 

11
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,329
．．．大家都成家立業了
八 

12
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,289
這甚至發生在我身上  
九 

13
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,291
九點半 十!

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,502
準備好了沒有，我來了 

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,756
我叫提姆，這個…這是我剩下的故事 

16
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,466
逃命去吧!

17
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,134
爸爸,不公平 你偷偷看了 

18
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,097
他們叫我全職爸爸，意思是…我們走!

19
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,140
．．.我把家裡打理的井井有條 朝氣蓬勃 

20
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,101
繫好安全帶,鄧普頓 

21
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,727
準備好了嗎?

22
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,437
好了 走!

23
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:54,072
現在，有些人可能會說我的想像力仍然過於豐富，
但當一個父親是世界上最酷的工作 

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,740
一堆很酷的工作，真的 

25
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,952
有時我是一個賽車手 

26
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,162
哇! 爸爸是馬里奧·安德烈蒂！

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,664
耶,鄧普頓!

28
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:07,168
有時候我是全縣最棒的廚師每頓飯都是我做的 

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,421
來吧，爸，請發牌給我

30
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,297
蒂娜 

31
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,550
呼,好樣的!莊家通殺 

32
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,301
耶!啊!

33
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,929
或者是外科醫生，如果需要的話 

34
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,931
叉勺 叉勺 

35
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,808
抹刀 抹刀 

36
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,395
賜予我造物生命吧!

37
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
她還活著!

38
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,985
我們有好有壞 

39
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,361
不,不,不 看 看 

40
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,654
小羊沒事 看到了嗎?耶!

41
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,489
但我們總是團結在一起 

42
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,658
我的妻子,卡羅 奇跡啊!

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
她是家裡的經濟支柱 

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,537
謝謝 你知道人們常說:

45
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,247
「和氣生財 」

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,166
丈夫的支持促成我今天的成就 

47
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,751
他確實能應付自如 

48
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,003
這是我能力所能及的 是的,媽媽!

49
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,424
她也掙錢養家，而我則照看我們的新寶寶蒂娜 

50
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:58,386
但有時候，感覺她在盯著我 

51
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,013
泰貝莎……謝謝!

52
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,808
．．.我們的二年級學生剛被鎮上最好的學校錄取了 

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,143
耶,泰貝莎!

54
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,644
我們感到驕傲 

55
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,313
我還和那幫老傢伙保持聯繫 

56
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,856
信不信由你，金博現在是市長了 

57
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,443
餅乾!當然了，他的妻子斯塔西才是這次行動的幕後主使 

58
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,738
喲,吉米!三胞胎… 逮到你  逮到你

59
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,365
逮到你

60
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,033
是啊，它們變化不大 

61
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:24,037
至於我的小弟弟，泰德，他長大後成了老闆 

62
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:32,712
他太忙了，我們幾乎見不到他了 但是，嘿，
他總是記得在特殊的場合送不合適的貴重禮物 

63
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,548
OMG !泰德叔叔是最好的!

64
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,263
總之，我的生活很完美 

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,850
但這一切即將改變 

66
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,145
天啊 

67
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,314
我要救你!

68
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,316
哈!

69
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,901
謝謝你,寶貝 

70
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,319
保持冷靜,泰貝莎 

71
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,779
我來找你了 

72
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,783
我要把你從冒泡的熔岩中救出來!

73
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,410
爸爸，你在幹什麼?

74
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,829
哎呀,噁心 它無處不在 

75
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,415
拜託，這是末日糖果火山!

76
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,625
你以前很喜歡的 

77
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,254
但我在努力做作業，否則我就完了 

78
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,006
哦 

79
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,926
因為如果說我學到了什麼，那就是你只有一次童年 

80
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,304
一旦你長大了，就再也回不去了 

81
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
咿!

82
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,983
哦,不 

83
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,737
晚安霍金博士

84
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,828
碳，硼，鈹，鋰，氦，氫

85
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,913
我搞定了 

86
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,832
Boom shakalaka 

87
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,463
「四項任務」事半功倍 

88
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,089
你好啊，泰貝莎 

89
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,632
《晚安秀》時間 

90
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,552
在臥室裡直播，由爸爸和媽媽主演 

91
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,305
還有特別嘉賓，寶貝蒂娜

92
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,474
晚安，小蒂娜 Mwah !

93
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
你給我回來 

94
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,852
晚上好,媽媽 Mwah !

95
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,520
晚安,甜心 媽媽會親你的 

96
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,980
媽媽會親你的 

97
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,190
晚安歌

98
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,691
和你爸爸…  ?

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,318
什麼?該唱晚安歌了 

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,028
哦,不,謝謝 

101
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,405
我在聽白噪音!

102
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
幫助我入睡!

103
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:31,331
你覺得讓我幫你排練節日慶典怎麼樣?

104
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,791
是的!對吧?

105
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:38,338
我可以和你一起去學校，你可以把你所有的朋友聚在一起，我們可以一起排練，之後去吃冰淇淋 

106
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,423
治療 不!你不能這麼做 

107
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,467
嗯,責任問題 

108
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,344
是這整件事 

109
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,680
哦 對，對 

110
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,931
對 

111
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,558
哇 你最喜歡的睡前故事是什麼?

112
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,562
你知道的，關於…泰德叔叔是個會說話的神奇嬰兒 

113
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,608
有個裝滿小狗的火箭你拯救了世界 

114
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,026
這是個好故事，不是嗎?

115
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:04,072
嗯，這也說不通啊 

116
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,865
笑話不錯，對吧?

117
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,325
恩 

118
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
好的 嗯…爸爸 

119
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,039
我明天的日程安排得很緊 

120
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,042
是的 我的日程安排也很緊 

121
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,044
哦，別忘了小羊羔 

122
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,879
晚安，小羊羔 

123
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,798
晚安，泰德叔叔 

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,634
我希望長大後能像你一樣成功 

125
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,928
也許我們很快就能見到你 

126
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,934
晚安,泰貝莎 

127
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,938
你不覺得我現在太老了嗎?

128
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,607
呃,好吧 

129
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,152
我覺得我們都該長大了 

130
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,530
我期待著在早餐桌上和你打招呼 

131
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,830
甜蜜的夢想 

132
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,723
嗯 

133
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,443
時間都到哪裡去了?

134
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,904
我怎麼知道?

135
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,698
等等 我看到了光 

136
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,659
你，給我讓開 

137
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,787
終於 

138
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,498
自由的氣息 

139
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,749
威茲嗎?

140
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,459
你呢，這是哪個世紀?

141
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,795
放開我，邪惡的食人魔!

142
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,380
不，不，不 威茲,是我 

143
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,923
這是提姆 

144
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,883
真的是你嗎?

145
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,551
更接近 

146
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,512
讓我看看你的臉 

147
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,305
近了 

148
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,391
更近 

149
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,226
哦,蓋 

150
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,477
這是你 

151
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,187
嘿!這是為什麼?

152
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,317
你把我扔進永恆的黑暗中破壞了我的晝夜節律 

153
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,652
對不起,威茲 

154
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,320
嘿，不過你看起來很棒 

155
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,531
你是說除了手臂 

156
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,824
我都沒注意到 

157
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:15,787
你認為它 我是說，我注意到了，因為我…你顯然沒有胳膊 我…你絕不會這樣對待小羊羔的 

158
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,581
好吧,我……我把她給了我女兒，泰貝莎 

159
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,375
你有繼承人了嗎，提摩太?

160
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,710
實際上,兩個 

161
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,253
兩個?讓鐘聲敲響吧!

162
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,297
不,不,不 威茲,停下來 是的!是的!

163
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,174
威茲,噓!安靜,安靜 這是慶祝的時刻!

164
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,176
不,不,不 現在不是慶祝的時候 

165
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,886
威茲,噓 保持安靜 什麼?它是什麼?

166
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,805
怎麼了，提姆?我不知道 

167
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,767
我想我只是現在不太想慶祝 

168
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,686
哦?

169
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,521
泰貝莎 

170
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,692
天啊，巫師，她長得真快 

171
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,736
她好像已經不需要我了 

172
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,322
是的，首先，他們開始減少和你在一起的時間 

173
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,782
恩 

174
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,993
然後他們就不再向你尋求建議了 

175
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:55,994
完全正確 

176
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,121
很快，他們就會把你視為理所當然 

177
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,539
我猜 

178
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,499
那就打斷你的胳膊 什麼?

179
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,084
然後把你塞進盒子裡!

180
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,045
好吧 威茲,你……你沒有幫助 

181
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:12,886
好吧,我只是……怕泰貝莎和我越來越疏遠了，就像…就像我對我弟弟那樣

182
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,596
哦 

183
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,682
我以為我們有的是時間 

184
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,393
但你不能讓時光倒流，對吧?

185
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,021
你竟敢質疑我的力量!

186
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,441
回頭，回頭 開始了 

187
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,069
哦，偉大的車輪…等等 

188
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,904
你聽到了嗎?

189
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,907
不要濫用貪睡按鈕!

190
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,992
聽起來像是從嬰兒房傳來的 

191
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,994
它是什麼?一個黑夜的生物?

192
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,081
女巫嗎?這是地獄之犬的叫聲嗎?

193
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,415
威茲 !
威茲!

194
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,583
別走,提姆!

195
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,755
我可以讓時光倒流，回到黃金時代，那時只有你和我 

196
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,423
我的好 

197
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,175
不要開門 

198
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,094
記得最後一次!

199
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,309
如果你想打電話，請掛斷再打 

200
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,480
如果你需要幫助，請掛機，然後撥總機 

201
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,273
謝謝你！

202
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,441
喂?

203
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,696
如果你想打電話請掛斷再打 啊 只是我的電話 

204
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,823
振作起來，夥計 

205
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,244
蒂娜，你這個小小偷…晚安 

206
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,453
…瘋子!

207
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,124
哇!

208
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,876
嗨,爸爸 

209
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,962
泰貝莎嗎?是你嗎?

210
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,675
你真該看看自己的表情 

211
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,552
哦,這是無價的 

212
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,053
你……你……你,你……

213
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,974
你可以說話嗎?

214
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,143
是的 我在做家族生意 

215
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,812
這是夾上去的領帶 

216
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,774
你看，爸爸，寶寶公司更像是我…哦 

217
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,152
爸爸，爸爸，進來 你能聽到我說話嗎?

218
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,778
爸爸，你聽到了嗎?

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,488
爸爸，我舉起了幾根手指?

220
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,698
星期四嗎?

221
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,991
我應該警告你的 

222
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,534
我忘了你是個老人了 

223
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,037
等等，等等 

224
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,913
你來自寶寶公司 你是嗎?是的 

225
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,751
對我來說，寶寶公司更多的是一種副業 嗯 

226
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,836
重點是坦普爾頓家的事我全押上了 

227
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,338
去,鄧普頓!哦!好吧 

228
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,173
你們真會照顧孩子 

229
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,758
我是說，太不可思議了 哦,哦 

230
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,343
不是的，都是五星級的 

231
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,345
我不得不說，你有很多問題 當然 是的 

232
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,554
我們稍後會討論這個 

233
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,972
哦,我的天啊 我真不敢相信 

234
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,141
想去把媽媽嚇個半死嗎?

235
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,101
爸爸，集中精神 哦 

236
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,644
對,對,對 

237
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,355
嬰兒公司出現了危機 

238
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,481
這次又怎麼了?

239
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,523
小貓?

240
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,650
不 這一次，情況更糟 

241
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,902
比小貓無稽之談?是的 

242
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,572
所以我才自願參加這個秘密任務 媽媽 

243
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,491
哦，我想幫忙 你想讓我怎麼做?

244
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,034
這就對了，爸爸 

245
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,870
你正是我需要的人 是的!

246
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,663
去找泰德叔叔 

247
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,374
不 什麼?

248
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,875
你的臉怎麼了?

249
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,378
爸爸，寶寶公司不能再等了 

250
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,671
所有的壓力都在我身上，爸 

251
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,800
當我自願參加這項工作時，我以為會很容易 

252
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,385
但你們倆從來沒見過面 

253
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,969
它是如此悲傷 

254
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,180
這就像,負 課後見我 

255
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,724
悲傷?嗯,是的,也許 

256
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,934
一點 我不知道 

257
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,352
你忘記給他打電話了嗎?

258
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,270
我注意到你有時有點心不在焉 

259
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,647
對不起,什麼?

260
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,399
只是你有拖延癥 

261
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,278
你得讓他來這裡過節  不，我不是…不，我現在不會給他打電話 

262
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,115
爸爸，不能，永遠不能 沒有 你們倆吵架了還是怎麼了?

263
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,908
不 但你生他的氣了?

264
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,202
停止 它是複雜的 

265
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:29,624
為什麼?需要我幫你使用手機嗎? 不，我不需要幫助用我的…好的 是什麼問題?

266
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,126
這個問題是什麼?跟我說話 

267
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,877
沒必要，好嗎?

268
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,921
我打電話給他 我邀請他 他從未出現過 

269
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,591
他總是要參加工作會議，出差或者電話會議 

270
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,468
他只關心工作 

271
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,431
但過了一段時間，你…你只是停止嘗試 

272
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,641
他還是你哥哥

273
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,935
你是合作夥伴 

274
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:54,816
是啊，我猜有時候你…你成長，也成長 

275
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,571
爸爸，不要說不 

276
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,989
如果每個人都說不呢?

277
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,157
沒有什麼會發生 

278
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,575
沒有任何東西能夠起飛 

279
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,703
你每天醒來都要說"好，好，好"

280
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,123
讓我吃驚 說是的 

281
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,794
這真令人失望 

282
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,088
現在我很生氣!晚了 

283
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,174
我們明天再解決，好嗎?

284
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,803
你的小馬掉下來了 

285
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,348
再多一天也不會有壞處，對吧?

286
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,850
晚安,親愛的 

287
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,647
晚安,親愛的 

288
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,483
…霍爾西掉了 

289
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,151
泰貝莎?

290
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,503
嗯?

291
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,409
哦,別擔心 我得到了它 

292
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,285
她在哪裡呢?她在哪裡呢?

293
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,037
是誰?什麼?我已經盡快趕來了 

294
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,580
泰德?我取消了所有的會議 

295
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,541
你在這裡做什麼?你叫什麼?

296
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,792
泰貝莎?泰貝莎?

297
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,210
她在哪裡，提姆?泰德 

298
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,878
泰德叔叔，你來了!你真的在這裡 

299
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,463
哪只手臂?左邊或右邊?嗯?

300
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,382
是腓骨嗎?跟我說話 啊 

301
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,050
良好的擴張 開放 

302
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,969
「啊 」你還好嗎?你在幹什麼?

303
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,262
你看起來好 啊 

304
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,055
別擔心 我很好，泰德叔叔 

305
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,391
這是我的女孩 嗚呼 

306
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,018
什麼風把你吹來了?

307
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,394
泰貝莎從她的小馬上摔下來了 

308
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,229
她嗎?她嗎?

309
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,230
我做了嗎?

310
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,399
提姆給我留了語音留言 他嗎?

311
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,942
我嗎?你所做的 

312
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,861
你好 這是你的弟弟 

313
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,571
的幫助 泰貝莎從馬上摔了下來 

314
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,822
晚安,親愛的 

315
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,490
這真讓人不安 

316
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,077
我發誓我沒留言 

317
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,164
……目的 

318
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,291
我…Buttdialed嗎?

319
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,792
用我的屁股 

320
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,169
當我說夢話的時候 

321
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,754
我有時會這樣做 

322
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,380
你sleepbuttdialed我嗎?

323
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,467
用屁股 

324
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,887
我就知道肯定有個合理的解釋 

325
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,680
就是這樣 

326
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,599
嗯 重要的是你在這裡 

327
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,809
啊!耶!

328
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,269
當然 嗯,現在 

329
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,271
泰德叔叔，請留下來過聖誕節 請 

330
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,940
對不起,親愛的 我不能在25號過聖誕節 

331
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,193
但是，泰德叔叔，我很想你 

332
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,944
我好想你 

333
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,613
我好想你 …哇!

334
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,573
你不覺得我現在太老了嗎?

335
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,283
你不覺得我現在太老了嗎?

336
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,951
你不覺得我現在太老了嗎?

337
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,995
我能去廚房跟你談談嗎?

338
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,373
一個人 

339
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,377
寶貝,提姆?

340
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,046
她是從那裡被派來的 

341
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,715
樓上嗎?是對的 寶寶公司 

342
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,260
你是說那個語音信箱是某種求助電話 

343
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,262
是的!不 

344
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,182
她來自一個由嬰兒經營的秘密公司 

345
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,144
提姆，我會告訴你一個醫生的名字 

346
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,981
羅伊福德曼 告訴他是我派你來的，好嗎?

347
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,233
他們在說什麼?

348
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,734
我們應該給他們點私人空間 

349
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,027
在這兒你走 哦 謝謝 

350
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,362
我不是瘋了!

351
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,114
你只是不記得了 告訴他,蒂娜 

352
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,448
他……我…她不能說話，提姆 

353
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,158
不要打斷 

354
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,493
打斷?我什麼都沒聽到 

355
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,662
除了你那討厭的聲音 你聽到這個消息 

356
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,831
我有一副好嗓子 

357
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,249
好 

358
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,126
我可以證明我說的一切都是真的 

359
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,502
哦,是嗎?是的!

360
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,503
吮吸它,特德 

361
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,546
你說什麼?

362
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,672
你,吸 

363
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,132
不,不,提姆 你吸 

364
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,508
是時候去買棵聖誕樹了 

365
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,218
但我們已經有聖誕樹了 

366
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,429
不,我們沒有 不,我們沒有 是的,我們做的 是的,我們做的 

367
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,014
去死吧，去死吧，去死吧，去死吧，去死吧 

368
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,557
別讓我看你!原諒我 

369
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,685
我不願意打斷你們，但我可以提個建議嗎?

370
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,061
你們倆怎麼不去死?

371
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,022
哈!

372
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,817
她可以說話 很多 

373
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,611
繫好安全帶,男孩 

374
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,868
孩子在船上!

375
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,078
這就是我說的!啊!

376
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,595
是啊!啊!

377
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,768
哇 

378
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,729
我到家了 

379
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,022
是的 看到了嗎?

380
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,482
這都是真實的 

381
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,566
哇 

382
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,735
是我嗎?

383
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,488
如果你想要得到別人的稱讚，你已經得到了!

384
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,907
你是這裡的傳奇人物 

385
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,408
一座雕像?

386
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,952
是我單槍匹馬拯救了公司 

387
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,496
雙手贊成 

388
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,914
對吧?我們是合作夥伴 

389
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,040
真的嗎?

390
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,750
我沒看到你的雕像 

391
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,377
我仍然愛你，爸爸 

392
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,379
他們把頭的大小搞錯了 

393
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,217
聽我的，你要想出人頭地，就得有進取心 

394
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,596
爬上公司的階梯直到你成為最後一個孩子 

395
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:23,103
事實上，我優先考慮良好的工作和生活的平衡以及一個積極的環境，
這樣我的想法才能得到重視 

396
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,648
哦,你是認真的 

397
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,525
你真有趣，泰德叔叔 

398
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,777
我想知道為什麼他們沒有在你的檔案裡提到這一點 

399
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,945
我的文件嗎?

400
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,488
你看到我的檔案了?

401
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,781
是的 上面說什麼了?

402
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,116
它說明了很多 

403
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,535
這裡是危機中心 啊 哇 

404
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:43,039
我們在這裡監控世界各地對嬰兒的所有威脅 

405
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,332
和夏威夷 

406
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,126
這太酷了 這太酷了 

407
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,128
我是哥斯拉 

408
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,671
「啊，快逃命去吧!」快逃命吧!」

409
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,048
我們為什麼帶他來?爸爸，快下來 

410
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,801
哦 我們可以等沒人看的時候再玩 

411
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,511
什麼是危機?是的 

412
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,138
我們開始吧 什麼危機，親愛的?

413
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,556
生銹的,滾 

414
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,476
他的新 

415
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:07,313
想像一下，小外科醫生 

416
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,649
哦 

417
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,985
或嬰兒宇航員 

418
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,155
♫遨遊(宇宙)♫ 

419
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,491
是的，總有一天嬰兒會統治世界 

420
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,745
這一天來得比你想像的要早 

421
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:27,334
你好 我是埃爾文·阿姆斯特朗博士，橡子高級兒童中心的創始人 

422
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,294
等一下，那是…泰貝莎的學校 

423
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:34,299
在這個中心，我們相信嬰兒是終極的學習機器 

424
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,259
對吧，小內森?

425
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,428
是的!好吧 

426
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,474
他們應該利用寶貴的時間更快地發展，更努力地推動 

427
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,853
嗯 當然，父母的出發點是好的，但他們不是專家 

428
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:52,776
畢竟，唯一阻礙孩子成長的是……你 你!

429
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,487
這就解釋了為什麼泰貝莎一直遠離我 

430
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,405
是學校 每個人,波 

431
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,990
再見,媽媽 再見,媽媽!

432
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,241
再見,爸爸 再見,爸爸!

433
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,869
再會 

434
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:07,957
現在，在過去的六個月裡，這些學校如雨後春筍般出現在世界各地 

435
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,209
呃，有什麼問題嗎?

436
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
學校才是問題所在 

437
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,337
是的 學校都是惡的 

438
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,547
不，爸爸，不是所有的學校都是邪惡的 

439
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,675
就這一個，好嗎?好的 

440
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,970
如果阿姆斯特朗的哲學繼續傳播下去，童年可能就結束了 

441
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,430
不 

442
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,766
童年是我一生中最糟糕的三年 

443
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,351
這是如此悲傷 

444
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,228
你可能只是做得不對 

445
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,521
嗯?哦 

446
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,773
但幸運的是，你可以重來一次 

447
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,983
第二次機會 

448
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:43,910
寶寶公司公司開發了一種新的超級嬰兒配方奶粉，可以把成年人變回嬰兒 我們有櫻桃汁、葡萄汁、橙汁和酸橙汁 

449
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,704
真的嗎?等等，等等，等等 

450
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,664
你想讓我變成嬰兒?嘿，這是你最擅長的 

451
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:52,502
這樣你就可以潛入學校查出阿姆斯特朗博士到底想幹什麼 

452
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,088
剩下的就交給寶寶公司了 

453
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,593
這是完美的偽裝 

454
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,555
而且只持續了48個小時 

455
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,348
我也參與了這次任務 

456
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,516
對不起,老爸 …噢 

457
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,393
這不是你的任務 哦 

458
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:16,276
可能會導致流口水，胡言亂語，情緒爆發，大笑，失禁，大腿胖乎乎的?

459
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,112
我想我健身房裡的人會吃這個 

460
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,032
我的手發短信!

461
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,869
即使那是你女兒的學校 看起來不公平，不是嗎?

462
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,370
爸爸,沒有 請停止 

463
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,788
哇!

464
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,417
什麼?它真的有用 

465
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,462
它是我的!

466
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,297
我更擅長做這種事!哦!

467
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,134
那是什麼東西，海鷗群嗎?

468
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,806
資料!明白了!

469
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,642
你可能會很情緒化，有一些情緒波動 

470
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,187
哦!

471
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,730
嘿!

472
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,024
哎喲 這是一個尷尬的階段 

473
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,650
現在茶已經熱了，康妮 

474
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,652
你總是想當英雄，不是嗎?

475
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,571
這是什麼意思?

476
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,825
從來沒見過他…突然，他帶著一匹小馬出現了 

477
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,079
你只是嫉妒，頭盔頭 

478
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,497
她是我的女兒!

479
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,165
她是我的侄女 

480
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,167
你要加奶油或糖嗎?

481
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,712
我總是成功的那個 

482
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,340
媽媽說不許在家裡亂跑 

483
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,591
恩 

484
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,843
把瓶子給我，鯔魚 

485
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,014
你不能擁抱錢，你知道的 

486
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,145
但你可以的，提姆 你可以 

487
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,067
男人 我說的對嗎?

488
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,953
這不是個人 

489
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,788
它的業務,萊斯利 

490
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,916
這是我的私事，琳賽 

491
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,882
停，停，停，停，停!喔,喔,喔!

492
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,759
對不起,康妮 我不得不長話短說 

493
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,886
明天，我們來談談你的問題 

494
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,639
好的,超時!這已經夠了!

495
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,224
嘿 我們回家 

496
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,767
我們得到了另一棵樹 

497
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,019
一個真正的人 

498
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,479
嗯,現在在樓上 

499
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,897
快，快，快，快，快，快 

500
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,357
推動它 不,不,拉 

501
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,483
快，快，快，快 推動它 

502
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,068
拉 不,好吧 

503
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,154
右邊 為什麼我有重頭?

504
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,072
因為你年輕又強壯，親愛的 

505
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,449
更多 

506
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,616
我先!

507
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,909
來吧 離開 

508
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,745
提姆?泰德?媽媽 

509
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,121
繩 繩 

510
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,414
拿著繩子，拿著繩子，拿著繩子!

511
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,124
你不可能消失 

512
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,459
你需要一個借口 

513
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,960
噢!哦,是的 

514
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,086
我的軟肋 

515
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,254
你們在哪裡?

516
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,464
告訴她你在收拾東西 

517
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,300
我們在樓上收拾東西 

518
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,760
包裝?為了什麼?

519
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,511
哦 你要去參加兄弟情誼之旅 

520
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,097
我們要去兄弟情誼之旅 …噢!

521
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,724
現在?

522
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,392
但是，提姆，你的父母明天要來 

523
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,102
他們可以幫忙 

524
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,979
是的，他們可以幫忙 

525
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,899
什麼……不，你不能把我一個人留給你父母 

526
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,567
哦,蒂娜!

527
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,236
你在幹什麼?

528
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,948
好吧，知道嗎?你要進嬰兒監獄了 

529
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,784
哦，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不，不!泰貝莎!

530
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,285
親愛的，對不起 幫個小忙 

531
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,745
親愛的，舉起來 舉起來 

532
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,455
這是泰德·坦普爾頓，一個男人 

533
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,165
你可以走了 我有緊急的家庭事務 

534
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,376
向右，親愛的 是的，我有家人 

535
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,294
提姆，我上來了 

536
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,254
是的，我們得談談 

537
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,923
嘿,媽媽?

538
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,132
哦!蒂娜!

539
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,594
把它放下 把它放下 把它放下 

540
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,970
下來 把它放下 蒂娜!

541
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,807
把它放下!回到這裡!

542
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,309
蒂娜,停止!

543
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,436
你是怎麼了?

544
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,146
我們該走了!

545
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,648
什麼?現在?是的 

546
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,526
直升機並排停 再見!

547
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,695
等等，等等，等等 這麼快?哦,不 

548
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,869
什麼……他們真的就這麼走了嗎?

549
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:55,995
是的 

550
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,872
隱藏!

551
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,917
我得減肥了 

552
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,671
蒂娜!你有什麼問題?

553
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:14,055
你明天醒來要乖乖的，蒂娜 

554
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,390
不再有惡魔了，寶貝 

555
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,683
可以嗎?

556
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,019
好的 

557
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,483
哎呀！

558
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,195
謝謝你們能來，女士們 

559
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,530
你想吃點水果嗎?

560
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:31,573
噢!

561
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,574
是什麼……嘿!

562
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,159
我們能開始了嗎?

563
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,038
我想念我的牙齒 

564
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,081
我已經決定誰去執行任務了 

565
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,332
謝謝你！我接受 

566
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,417
這兩個你 

567
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,960
是的!不 

568
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,712
寶寶公司想重新組隊，對吧?

569
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:46,838
不 

570
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,214
他們認為這是個糟糕的主意 

571
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,382
他們當然會 

572
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,217
好吧，我是老闆，蘋果醬 

573
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,220
我覺得你們倆在一起比分開要好 

574
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,515
我是一個人工作，至少不是和他一起 

575
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,559
嘿 「團隊」中沒有「我」 

576
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:05,732
事實上，team這個詞裡也沒有U，但有一個ME 「TEAM…但是團隊合作似乎不起作用 

577
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,109
啊 如果你想把事情做好，就得自己動手 

578
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,653
我們都在一起 人不為己 

579
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,405
1是最孤獨的數字 

580
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,282
是的 我們的人!

581
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,159
啊哈!

582
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,745
哦 抱歉 

583
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,163
好吧 晚安，各位 

584
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,581
唷 

585
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:25,585
看來我們只能把你的大雕像熔掉然後把它變成參與的獎品了 

586
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,420
求你了，別，別傷害我的雕像 

587
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:35,637
我們有秘密情報阿姆斯特朗博士每天早上11點15分離開辦公室 

588
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,434
你得溜進去，裝上這些監控裝置，然後向我匯報 

589
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,560
天啊，這太酷了 

590
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:43,728
測試 

591
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,105
黑夜裡的陌生人…

592
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,943
我已經安排了一輛校車早上8點整到這裡!

593
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,569
謝謝，康妮 晚安 

594
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,071
不要遲到 

595
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,322
明白了 

596
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,282
簡簡單單 輕輕鬆鬆,男孩們 

597
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,159
我們去睡覺吧!

598
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,183
嘿，怎麼了?

599
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,936
沒什麼 

600
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,312
親愛的，別擔心 

601
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:29,315
我相信你爸爸會及時回來看你參加選美的 

602
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,692
沒關係 

603
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,068
什麼?你不想讓他來嗎?

604
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,654
我猜 你當然知道 

605
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,614
現在，繼續睡覺 

606
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,033
晚安,媽媽 

607
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,368
晚安,親愛的 

608
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,181
你不想讓他來嗎?

609
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,099
我猜 

610
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,770
你不覺得我現在太老了嗎?

611
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,522
我覺得我們都該長大了 

612
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:18,031
蒂莫西·萊斯利·鄧普頓的審判現在開始 

613
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,407
哈!萊斯利 

614
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,534
審判?等等,什麼…罪名是什麼?

615
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,869
欺詐行為 

616
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,538
聲稱自己是世界上最好的爸爸 

617
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,998
但我從沒說過…展覽 

618
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,209
得了吧 那是一份禮物 

619
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,253
我建議你讓你的律師來談 

620
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,422
哦,不 

621
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,966
在我那個年代，你得掙個這樣的孩子 

622
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:41,054
爸爸,什麼?我沒有……他最好的朋友是一個鬧鐘 

623
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:41,846
媽媽 

624
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,516
他打斷了我的胳膊 

625
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,059
不,我沒有!是我哥哥 

626
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,227
異議,法官大人 

627
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,687
持續 

628
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,815
我們陪審團認為被告…一個失敗!

629
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,608
泰貝莎，你能幫幫我嗎?

630
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,984
哇!

631
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:57,404
爸爸，家庭作業，太多了 

632
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,571
啊!泰貝莎!

633
00:28:58,613 --> 00:28:59,781
時間到了 

634
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,367
等 不!保存我,爸爸!救我!

635
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,750
哦,男人 這是瘋狂的 

636
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,170
我們睡過頭了!我們睡過頭了嗎?

637
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,880
我們睡過頭了 醒醒，小半身人!

638
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,049
醒來!現在是哪一年?

639
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,844
哦,不 

640
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,595
這很糟 不 

641
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,264
不!不 

642
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,598
起床了 

643
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,933
起床了 我們得走了 

644
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,810
來吧 我們要遲到了…哦!

645
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,103
我會發郵件給你 

646
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,604
這是怎麼呢

647
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,898
啊，我忘了把威茲設置為夏時制!

648
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,943
什麼? !天亮了，提姆 

649
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,237
我得去拿我們要種的植物和蟲子 

650
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,114
抓住 我們得走了 不要恐慌 不要恐慌 

651
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,657
噢 祝成功,男孩 

652
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,783
讓我們滾 

653
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,286
Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoaoa…!

654
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,082
Upsies 

655
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,543
我需要upsies…!哦!

656
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:54,961
穿好衣服 

657
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,341
你對我做了什麼?!

658
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,301
不,真的嗎?什麼，我們要去航海嗎?

659
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,470
哦,不 不，不，它要走了 

660
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,141
等等,不,不 停!

661
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,310
停止,停止,停止 回來!

662
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,478
喂! !

663
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,812
回來!

664
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,024
好,朋友 

665
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,609
我們現在該怎麼辦?

666
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,919
哦,不!

667
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,342
寶貝，我高貴的駿馬 

668
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:45,512
我們上學的第一天不能遲到 

669
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,641
哦,噁心 

670
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,351
嗯?

671
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,687
塔利霍，寶貝!

672
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,818
這匹小馬討厭我 哦!

673
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,277
不是她恨你，提姆 

674
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,862
她就是不尊重你 

675
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,743
去了!去了!

676
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,704
我要去導航說的地方 

677
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:11,913
向左轉 

678
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,289
謝謝你,導航 

679
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,916
哇!右轉 

680
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,584
對不起 

681
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,004
向左轉 繼續當前路線 

682
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,090
Yeehaw !
Yeehaw!

683
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:23,800
重新計算 

684
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:25,635
抓緊你的槍套 

685
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:26,928
Hyah !
Hyah!

686
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,765
哦,不 這是卡羅!

687
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:31,891
不回答它 

688
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,059
嗨 哦,提姆 

689
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,310
你們的友誼之旅怎麼樣?

690
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,062
嗯…哇!

691
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,397
哇 慢下來 

692
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:42,110
如何……是……你的…結合旅行嗎?啊!哇 

693
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,738
你在這裡!

694
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,074
哦,不 我是說，我希望你在這裡 

695
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,325
哦，我們也想你 

696
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,410
我們不,女孩?

697
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:55,498
我們,呃…我們在重新啟動我們的關係，恢復我們曾經的親密感 

698
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,917
太棒了 我們得走了 

699
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,127
你在哪裡?

700
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,587
嗯，曲棍球比賽 嘿!

701
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,172
他射門，他得分!

702
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,465
他成績!他成績!

703
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,091
女士們先生們，他得分了!

704
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,676
了……  了……

705
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:07,844
了 

706
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,679
那是警察嗎?

707
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,098
不，不是警察 

708
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,933
這是,呃…這是一個曲棍球鬧鐘 

709
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,143
更快,提姆 

710
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,895
我才不要回監獄去!

711
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,190
我只是想提醒你泰貝莎的選美比賽就在明晚 

712
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,025
你必須在場 

713
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,779
我會以某種形式出現的 

714
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,115
你承諾嗎?我的承諾 

715
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,533
那泰德呢?

716
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:31,951
節日快樂,警察 

717
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,913
你不會活捉我的，明白嗎?

718
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,206
嗯,他很忙 

719
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,957
你在幹什麼?這是警察 

720
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,459
對不起,警官 

721
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,378
聖誕老人給每個人都準備了禮物 

722
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,462
對不起 

723
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,135
重新計算 

724
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,305
哦,我的上帝!它是如此真實!

725
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,307
它是如此真實!它是如此真實!

726
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,769
提姆?

727
00:32:58,978 --> 00:32:59,896
重新計算 

728
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:01,064
向左!

729
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,357
重新計算 

730
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,692
向右!

731
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,110
重新計算 

732
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,986
我們期待已久的時刻到了!

733
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,034
按當前路線前進 

734
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,202
看,提姆?

735
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:17,122
總是信任…神聖的…提姆?

736
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,415
呃,卡羅爾?

737
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,125
你要分手了 我要失去你了 

738
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,584
不，親愛的，我聽得很清楚 

739
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:23,837
選美比賽見 得走了 再見 好的 

740
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,757
哇!對不起 

741
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,262
哦，不，不，不，不，不 

742
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,681
太真實了!太真實了!

743
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,898
塔利霍，寶貝!

744
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,653
不，不，不，理…哇，哇，哇，哇!

745
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:54,868
蒂娜!蒂娜!

746
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,036
哇!

747
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,539
啊!

748
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,791
哇!

749
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,670
樹!

750
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,672
你已經到達目的地了 

751
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,091
還剩一分鐘

752
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,844
哦 嗯 

753
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,012
我會給他們寄一張支票 

754
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,431
哦，真有趣 

755
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:17,891
你做到了 

756
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,225
我們做到了 

757
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,977
我想是的 

758
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,812
我說的是我和珍愛 

759
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,814
哦 對嗎，寶貝?

760
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,024
是的 正確的 

761
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,817
下來!

762
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,043
哇 這地方看起來甚至很邪惡 

763
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,003
這只是一所學校 

764
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,755
你反應過度了 

765
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:50,006
寶寶公司也是如此 

766
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:53,218
不，我跟你說，這所學校讓泰貝莎壓力很大 

767
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,969
泰貝莎能搞定 

768
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,097
她真是一個模子刻出來的 

769
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,099
等等，那個街區是誰?我 

770
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,934
好吧，你不能成為阻礙 我是塊 

771
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,435
然後開始表現得像塊石頭 

772
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,270
這是什麼意思?我是塊 

773
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,147
我一直是個攔路虎 是的 甚至沒有關閉 

774
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,607
我所做的就是阻擋 

775
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,192
我早上醒來，我就會阻塞 

776
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,069
我去睡覺，堵塞 

777
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,446
我 提姆,足夠了 

778
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:16,032
我 不,你不是!停止它!

779
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,325
噓 

780
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,702
甜的 

781
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,161
笨蛋 

782
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,122
孩子們只能越過這個點 嘿 

783
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:25,208
請勿在隔離區哭泣 

784
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,793
好吧，看來我們得分頭行動了 

785
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,253
好 我可以休息一下 

786
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,380
再見,媽媽 好的，再見，親愛的 

787
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:31,965
泰貝莎 

788
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,342
放學後見 好的 

789
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,139
顯然，沒有A

790
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,349
在「團隊合作」 

791
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:42,851
好了，我們走吧 

792
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,686
沒有那麼快 

793
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:47,230
我是藍色的 你是黃色的 

794
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,858
你在那邊的小火車裡 

795
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,945
哦 裡面全是嬰兒 

796
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,363
是嗎?我沒有注意到 

797
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,824
只是開玩笑 它是滑稽的 

798
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,451
嗯,等 你的領帶是彎曲的 

799
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,910
好的,提姆,焦點 

800
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:03,663
我們11點15分在阿姆斯特朗辦公室外見面 

801
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,665
我們溜進去，裝上竊聽器 

802
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:06,833
你關注嗎?

803
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,086
嗨,什麼…我很專注，好吧 不,沒有 

804
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:11,421
我不是黃色的 我是藍色的 

805
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,506
11:30 堅持計劃 

806
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:14,549
15分 

807
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,551
15. 明白了 街區是集中的 

808
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,387
我是藍色!啊!我是藍色的 

809
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,349
難道你不明白嗎?我是藍色!

810
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,351
孩子們,歡迎 

811
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,727
威爾康曼 

812
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,187
歡迎 

813
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,355
你好 

814
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,231
,早上好 

815
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:34,194
謝謝你選擇成為優秀的人 

816
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,737
請別碰我 

817
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,114
這是一個荒謬的錯誤 

818
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,616
我是藍色!我是藍色!

819
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,368
公車上的輪子是r的平方

820
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,703
四周的圓周  是的 

821
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,208
你好 

822
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,001
嗯,你好 

823
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,711
漂亮的植物 

824
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,214
這是我的精神支柱 

825
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,049
嗨 我是新來的 

826
00:36:56,091 --> 00:37:00,261
這就是元素週期表中的其他元素 

827
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,180
哦 

828
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,723
好吧 

829
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,392
不能坐在這裡 

830
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,227
或者在這裡 或者在那裡 

831
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,524
座位位置由班級排名決定 

832
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:18,988
我們不可能包含你的數據，因為你以前學校的嚴格程度是一個未知變量 

833
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,240
哦 

834
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,866
燒傷病，內森 

835
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,118
噢 

836
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,244
在這裡 

837
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,413
你可以坐我的位置 

838
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,873
我真為你驕傲 

839
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,875
我的意思是……謝謝 

840
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:35,255
好吧……早上好 

841
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,673
早上好，阿姆斯特朗博士!

842
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,050
非常熱烈的歡迎 謝謝你！

843
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,385
嗯?

844
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:44,222
如你所見，今天有個新同事加入了我們 

845
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,724
哦 你好 

846
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,517
新同事，你何不自我介紹一下 

847
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,603
呃，我叫蒂…嗯,馬科斯 

848
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,023
嗯 馬科斯光速 

849
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,608
馬科斯光速 

850
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,194
是的 豐富多彩，有個性，我喜歡 

851
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:04,242
無論如何……歡迎來到藍色小隊，馬科斯 我們最先進的班級 

852
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:08,413
這是稀薄的空氣，我們在呼吸 

853
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:14,961
在Acorn中心，我們相信所有的競爭都是…健康的競爭 

854
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,890
我被困在達姆桶裡了 

855
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:30,268
我恐慌癥發作了 

856
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,687
這裡一定有出去的路 

857
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,817
有點不對勁 

858
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,944
藍莓 

859
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,907
我得離開這裡 

860
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,158
嗨 

861
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,659
別看著我 

862
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,661
好的 

863
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:53,083
我們今天的第一個主題是……沒有分數，沒有分數，沒有分數 哇!

864
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,835
粒子物理 

865
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,003
是的!什麼?

866
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,129
是的!

867
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:04,594
誰知道是哪位科學家首先提出了宇宙有極限的理論，
超過了極限物理定律就會失效?

868
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,931
哇 似乎每個人都知道 

869
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:11,434
先生光速 

870
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,979
嗯,博士詭計……嗎?

871
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:17,857
哦，那是錯誤的答案 

872
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,694
他的大腦肯定不會以光速運動 

873
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,488
嗯,好吧 我知道，對吧?

874
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,365
任何其他的嗎?對 

875
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,783
馬克斯·普朗克 

876
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,284
這是正確的 

877
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,703
泰貝莎樹立了標桿 

878
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,413
黑板上的第一個 叮,叮,叮 

879
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,540
幹得好，泰貝莎 

880
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,042
你完蛋了，坦普爾頓 

881
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,502
來吧，內森 

882
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,712
是的,泰貝莎 得到他 

883
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,256
下一個話題 

884
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,882
古希臘 

885
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:45,719
Opa !奧普拉!

886
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,887
注意 

887
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,764
注意,每一個人 

888
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,475
誰想演肖申克?

889
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:53,977
不!嗯?

890
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,981
誰想出去玩?

891
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:01,109
聽起來有趣嗎?好 

892
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,069
有人有什麼想法嗎?

893
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,404
不!拜託，各位 

894
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,530
想想，想想，想想，想想，想想 

895
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,781
我們需要跳出思維定勢 

896
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,241
哦,哦,哦!我,我!哦!你,BoPeep 

897
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:13,288
我們可以用冰棒棍和泡泡糖做一個熱氣球!

898
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,332
它怎麼飛呢?

899
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,251
僊塵!

900
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,794
回盒子裡去，波比 

901
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,088
一直進去?一直往裡走 

902
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,299
耶!哦 我們也能進盒子裡嗎?

903
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,343
我們可以嗎?我們可以嗎?膠水 

904
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,303
我喜歡膠水 

905
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,512
誰不?

906
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:30,972
但是我們想要集思廣益 

907
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,265
膠很好 

908
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:39,939
快想，快想，快想，快想……快想，
快想，快想，快想，快想，快想!

909
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,441
賓果 

910
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,776
下一個話題 

911
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:46,738
X等於…哦,我!本身 

912
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,406
泰貝莎的榮譽 

913
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:49,908
哇 你知道嗎?

914
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:54,746
世界鋁土礦的主要生產商是…哦!澳大利亞 

915
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,122
又一次，泰貝莎上了衝浪板 

916
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,375
非常好 是的,泰貝莎!

917
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,001
我們還有15分鐘，各位 

918
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,170
「嘗試」和「勝利」的區別

919
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,963
只是有點魅力 

920
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,092
魅力!要麼做大，要麼回家 

921
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,718
好吧 要回家了 

922
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,512
我們快點吧 不!

923
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,556
諾瑪·雷 這是我的時代 

924
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,725
生存，還是毀滅?泰貝莎 

925
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,310
 這是正確的 

926
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:21,314
誰能告訴我302引擎的馬力是多少?

927
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,149
呃,七?

928
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:24,901
哦,男孩 醬汁太淡了，內森 

929
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,486
太弱了 

930
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,737
泰貝莎，你有什麼想法嗎?

931
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,323
300馬力，四桶碳水化合物 

932
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:31,616
哇 

933
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,493
她爸爸一定是個天才 

934
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,037
聽我的信號，放馬過來 

935
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,957
火!

936
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,544
是的!

937
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,880
我找到解藥了!

938
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,674
是的!是的!她做到了!

939
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:48,883
她做到了 

940
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,178
馬科斯!

941
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,472
我做到了 我做到了 

942
00:41:56,391 --> 00:42:00,270
記住，你的體型並不能決定你的力量 

943
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:05,692
目前為止，泰貝莎是第一，其他人是最後 

944
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:16,411
噓 嘿,泰貝莎 

945
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:20,290
你真的…極客 我知道 不 

946
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,208
你真了不起 

947
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,544
哦 謝謝,馬科斯 

948
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,048
你會在排練時改變態度的 

949
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,133
錯誤的調整 

950
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,635
你真有趣 

951
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:34,346
搞笑!

952
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:39,392
還有，坦普爾頓，別遲到 

953
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,102
遲了 

954
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,229
我遲到了 下一個話題 

955
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:44,439
是的!

956
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:46,399
再往前一點 

957
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:50,737
膠水!

958
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,740
原諒我 

959
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,033
是的,馬科斯 

960
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:57,869
能給我一張通行證嗎?我得走了 

961
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:00,413
瞧 感覺自由 

962
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,082
現在怎麼辦呢?

963
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,875
現在什麼?

964
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,502
膠水!

965
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:07,379
膠水是不好的!

966
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,256
膠水 

967
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,717
膠水是好的 

968
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,096
怎麼去校長辦公室 

969
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,597
當然可以 

970
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,517
你會被送到校長辦公室 

971
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:25,021
呵呵!

972
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:28,066
我認為搖滾押韻很重要 

973
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,110
開始了，搖滾押韻是很棘手的

974
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:34,030
要在合適的時間搖滾一首押韻，這很棘手

975
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,366
這很棘手，棘手，棘手，棘手

976
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:38,076
搖滾押韻是很棘手的

977
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:40,620
要在合適的時間搖滾一首押韻，這很棘手……

978
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:42,455
怎麼了,你們呢?

979
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:46,084
學校是…愚蠢 

980
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,837
聽著，我知道你很生氣 

981
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:51,631
很，很有爭議，但請坐 

982
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:54,342
好的 哦,不 

983
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,137
坐著是……愚蠢的!

984
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:59,639
他真是個壞孩子 哦 

985
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,852
搖滾押韻是很棘手的

986
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,479
要在合適的時間搖滾一首押韻，這很棘手

987
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,982
怎麼樣，D? 這很棘手，棘手…

988
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,235
好吧 恐怕你不能再擾亂課堂了 

989
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:16,031
哦,不 我們要去你辦公室談嗎?

990
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:17,657
不 

991
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,826
你得暫停一下 這個盒子嗎?

992
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:21,828
他要進盒子了

993
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,330
不，盒子讓你發瘋 

994
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:25,832
這個盒子嗎?

995
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:29,502
起航吧，起航吧，起航吧

996
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:32,339
遠航吧，遠航吧

997
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,798
起航吧…

998
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,051
再會,馬科斯 

999
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,636
你的暫停現在開始 

1000
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:40,013
放鬆 

1001
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:42,182
等等!

1002
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,269
別哭了 

1003
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,188
在那裡,在那裡 所有的更好 

1004
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:00,283
就像他們常說的

1005
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:04,871
如果你想把事情做好，就得在沒有你弟弟的情況下做!

1006
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,833
我們又見面了，門把手 

1007
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,341
你好 

1008
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,842
歡迎,歡迎

00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:19,761
請進 可以給你們嗎?

1010
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,221
你在這裡 

1011
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:24,974
哦,是的 我…我正等你呢 

1012
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:34,317
我…我以為你會在等我，所以 

1013
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,906
對了，我知道你為什麼來所以…所以在那裡 

1014
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:42,742
你會怎麼做?

1015
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:45,036
嗯 是的,我喜歡 

1016
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,746
請坐 

1017
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,164
謝謝你！

1018
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:49,874
你知道你是什麼嗎?

1019
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:54,254
恕我直言，你非常聰明 

1020
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,755
繼續 

1021
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,382
事實上，我一直在觀察你 

1022
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,510
明智地花時間 檢查 

1023
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:03,179
充分利用課堂資料 檢查 

1024
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:05,765
雙手歸自己 檢查 

1025
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,308
嘿，忘了"與人合作愉快"吧 "

1026
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,437
你讓別人為你工作 

1027
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:13,857
這就是我正在寫的書的名字 

1028
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:18,236
沒有開玩笑 你不該進黃色警戒線，對吧?

1029
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,613
被破壞 破壞 完全正確 

1030
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:23,199
嫉妒、恐懼 嘿，我也遇到過同樣的困難 

1031
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:32,125
事實上，你讓我想起了我在你這個年紀的時候，也就是現在 

1032
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:36,629
什麼?

1033
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:41,301
驚喜,驚喜 

1034
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,803
菜肉餡煎蛋餅?

1035
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:44,929
好把 

1036
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,390
他是一個英航……你是一個嬰兒 

1037
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,976
我再說一遍，你是個嬰兒 

1038
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,479
太驚訝了，你說了兩次 

1039
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:59,736
不幸的是，人們還沒準備好……一個身居高位的嬰兒 

1040
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:01,279
然而 

1041
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,990
記得提醒我記下你那個大鬍子男的電話 

1042
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,826
我需要你這樣的人 

1043
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:10,789
擁有和我一樣的高智商 

1044
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,500
嗯……真的嗎?嗯 

1045
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:17,087
一個能…嗯 

1046
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,505
嗯 是的 

1047
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:21,257
真正理解我想要實現的目標 

1048
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,010
你正看著他呢 賓果 

1049
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,221
嗯 我們有個秘密關卡 

1050
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:27,889
嗯 為特別的寶寶準備的 

1051
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,391
嗯 精英中的精英 

1052
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:30,642
啊 的精英 

1053
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:31,685
除了藍色?

1054
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,728
哦,是的 超出 

1055
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,730
超出 哦 

1056
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:39,609
嗯 今天有一個會議... ...放學後 

1057
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,152
嬰兒 

1058
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:46,408
我們也許很小，但我們要給成年人一個重要的教訓 

1059
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,703
嗯 棒棒糖?

1060
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,037
好的 

1061
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,580
哦 課間休息的時候了 

1062
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,082
再見 

1063
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,835
再見……

1064
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,466
嗯，我覺得很順利 

1065
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,386
你太幼稚了 什麼?

1066
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,430
再說一遍，你還是個嬰兒 

1067
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,142
他是在跟我說話嗎?他最好不是在跟我說話，因為我會…阿姆斯特朗嗎?

1068
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:13,893
你是對的,康妮 

1069
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,437
他說的是阿姆斯特朗 

1070
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:23,153
我不知道她怎麼了 費德曼醫生，她的行為很奇怪 現在說"糟糕的2 "是不是太早了?

1071
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:25,030
有可怕的嗎?有這種事嗎?

1072
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:26,573
彈鋼琴的兔子，你殺了我 

1073
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,158
感覺正好 

1074
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,495
我們需要有人盯著獎品，從視覺上確認 

1075
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,041
哦,爸爸 

1076
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,126
如果我在，我一定會掐你 

1077
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,003
遠航吧，遠航吧……

1078
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,838
你的暫停結束了 

1079
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,757
遠航!幾點了?

1080
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:45,467
到休息時間了 

1081
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:47,510
我遲到了，我遲到了，我遲到了，我遲到了 來吧 

1082
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:49,512
他會明白的,對吧?

1083
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:51,348
好的 他在哪兒?他在哪裡?

1084
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:56,686
他在哪兒?嗯…魅力!是的,寶貝!

1085
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,271
不，不是我的弓 

1086
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:04,652
但那不是你的弓…了 是啊，有人哭的地方，就是我弟弟 

1087
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,659
噓 給你 

1088
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,244
酷 

1089
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:16,331
膠水 膠水 膠水 

1090
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,002
啊,哇,哇 嘿,藍色 啊!

1091
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,796
你想去哪裡?你失去了嗎?

1092
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:23,797
請讓我過去好嗎?

1093
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,256
不!

1094
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:27,967
怎麼，你在塗色課上掛科了嗎，孩子?

1095
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,594
真的,人嗎?

1096
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,305
嗯,櫻桃 

1097
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,306
繼續 

1098
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:34,683
藍色在另一邊 

1099
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,017
讓他通過 

1100
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:37,143
好的,他很酷 

1101
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:38,561
看到了嗎?我很酷 

1102
00:49:38,603 --> 00:49:39,813
我很酷 

1103
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,648
你讓我失望了，提姆 

1104
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,108
我是絕望 

1105
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:48,238
我爬 我用膠水做了一些我不引以為傲的事，但我做到了 

1106
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:52,200
我一路去了阿姆斯特朗的辦公室，然後提姆呢?

1107
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,410
我知道 我…提姆?

1108
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:55,161
我試圖……提姆? !

1109
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,038
我在盒子裡好嗎?

1110
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,289
這個盒子嗎?這個盒子嗎?

1111
00:49:58,331 --> 00:49:59,165
膠水 

1112
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:00,709
是的,這是正確的 

1113
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,960
這個盒子 

1114
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:03,336
放尊重點 

1115
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,256
看，小炯，這就是我獨自工作的原因 

1116
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:08,842
我會成功完成任務的 

1117
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:10,385
你可以把小馬帶回家 

1118
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:13,805
你唯一能成功的事就是獨處 

1119
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,015
在 在!

1120
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:16,516
好啊!

1121
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,018
我喜歡矮種馬 

1122
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:20,395
啊!謝謝樓主分享 

1123
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,029
你搞砸了，坦普爾曼!

1124
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,196
是的,鄧普頓 

1125
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:31,614
我嘗試 

1126
00:50:31,656 --> 00:50:34,284
啊!你總是來得很晚 

1127
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,786
對不起,內森 我盡力了 

1128
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:40,707
你只要盡力，我就不會去茱莉亞音樂學院了 

1129
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:45,086
是的,鄧普頓 一，二，三，還有一，二，三 一，二，三

1、2……哦,加油!

1132
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,054
你在開玩笑嗎?

1133
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:55,722
我現在做不到，好嗎?

1134
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:57,182
我不能 我只是不能 

1135
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,351
我明天再做 認真?

1136
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:03,480
好了好了好了

1137
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:05,899
明天選美比賽見 

1138
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,859
戰勝它!

1139
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,658
內森，內森，讓我來 

1140
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,035
讓我來吧，內森 

1141
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,578
我想唱這首歌 

1142
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,913
不 

1143
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:21,873
我想看她失敗 

1144
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,583
哦 

1145
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,210
純粹的天才 

1146
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:29,089
我等不及了 

1147
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,632
我們走著瞧 

1148
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:32,592
再見,孩子們 

1149
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:33,760
再會 

1150
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,095
再會 

1151
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:36,262
告別 

1152
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,223
再見,厄爾尼諾 

1153
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,270

1154
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,277
哦,我的天啊 

1155
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:54,739
停下你正在做的 

1156
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,116
我看見一匹小馬駒 

1157
00:51:57,992 --> 00:51:59,494
我喜歡矮種馬 

1158
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:00,787
哦,在那邊!

1159

00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:14,009
就這些嗎?沒有你好?

1162
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,052
連一句「嗨，媽媽」都沒說?什麼?

1163
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:17,929
嗨,泰貝莎!

什麼?你從沒告訴我你有個會開車的姐姐 

1166
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,603
那是我媽媽 

1167
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:27,355

可愛的孩子

好吧，我最好走了，如果我要走這三英里半回家…在雪地裡……沒有一件夾克 

1178
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,840
三英里半?

1179
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,676
三分半，六分，大概在這 

1180
00:52:56,718 --> 00:52:59,054

00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:19,032
是惡作劇嗎?

1190
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,367
孩子們可以如此殘忍 

1191
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:21,826
你好 

1192

00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,907
產品測試嗎?

1196
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:06,996
嗯 直覺告訴我這不是日托所 

1197

噓 噓 

1217
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,849
哪個瘋狂的地下堡壘沒有忍者?

1218
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,476
我說的對嗎?令人印象深刻的,嗯?

1219
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:10,810
非常令人印象深刻 

1220
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:12,312
你覺得呢?你覺得呢?

1221
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:15,565
我知道學費很貴，但你是怎麼負擔得起這些的?

1222
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,525

1226
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,370

他把我踢出了任務 

1257
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:36,354
他不能那麼做 

1258
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,397
只有我能做到 

1259

是的，但以一種好的方式 

1278
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,355
為什麼選美會讓你這麼緊張?

1287
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:45,799

00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,372
真的嗎?

1324
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:05,628
他們讓我接觸一萬小時的莫扎特音樂、語言課程和公共廣播 嗯 哇 

1325
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,422
我討厭公共廣播 

1326
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:10,967
就在那時，我意識到我比我的父母更聰明 

1327
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,971
我第一步就離家出走了 

1328
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,223
為什麼?

1329
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:19,059
他們擺佈我 

1330
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,227
總是有人告訴我該怎麼做 

1331
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:25,440
但是一個字改變了我的生活 

1332
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:27,067
「沒有 」說出來 

1333
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:28,401
不!

1334
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,403
打個盹 不!

1335
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:32,322
穿上你的外套 不行!

1336
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:34,699
吃你的蔬菜 Nahii !

1337
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,993
你要讓大人們擺佈你嗎?

1338
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:39,371
不,不!不,不,不!不,不!不,不,不!

1339
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:40,747
是你嗎?上帝,好沒有 

1340
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,082
這是正確的 

1341
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:45,085
到底為什麼父母能管事?

1342
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:47,504
他們有過機會，而我們得到了什麼?

1343
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:51,675
污染、政治、戰爭 

1344
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:54,052
哦 

1345
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,096
而不是「哦」 「噓 」

1346
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:57,722
噓!

1347
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:02,769
唯一阻礙我們的是他們，但現在不是了 

1348
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,690
我們努力奮鬥的時刻就要到來了 

1349
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:07,857
生日 

1350
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:09,109
BDay嗎?BDay 

1351
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,236
我這麼多 我這麼多 

1352
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,613
不，不，不是…今天不是你的生日 

1353
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:16,491
這是嬰兒革命的開始 

1354
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,326
耶,耶 

1355
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:20,995
還有蛋糕 蛋糕 

1356
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:23,790
蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!

1357
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,417
沒有更多的規則 

1358
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,293
哦啦啦!

1359
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:29,045
沒有更多的父母 

1360
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,296
哦 

1361
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,464
皮，皮，皮，皮!

1362
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,967
再見，媽媽和爸爸!

1363
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,011
哦，這太糟糕了 

1364
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,929
好了，動員會結束了 

1365
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,348
你父母會來接你的 

1366
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:42,976
這是我畢生的心血 

1367
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,937
是的，長達17個月 

1368
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,565
……沒有更多的父母 

1369
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:50,233
嗯 

1370
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,694
為革命乾杯 

1371
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:55,363
沒有 不 不 

1372
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,240
沒有 哦，這很值得注意 哦,蒂娜 

1373
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:59,367
哦，太可愛了 這個應用叫什麼?

1374
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,827
這叫QT Snap 哦 

1375
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,787
告訴我怎麼下載 每個人都有 

1376
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,831
所以,馬科斯……光速?

1377
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:06,458
你是這麼說的嗎?嗯 

1378
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:08,293
聽起來像個卡通名字 

1379
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,338
真的 

1380
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:18,678
我的父母，他們有點古怪，所以…嗯 我好像在什麼地方見過你 

1381
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,055
我不這麼想 

1382
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:21,723
那也是一個守護者 嘿 嘿 

1383
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,767
他看起來面熟嗎?我想我不知道 

1384
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,226
是啊，他長得很像提姆 

1385
01:01:25,268 --> 01:01:26,853
是的 你看起來像提姆 

1386
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,064
嗯?嗯?

1387
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,607
除了提姆沒有戴眼鏡 

1388
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,776
哦,這是正確的 

1389
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:35,278
嗯 嗯，怎麼樣 

1390
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,864
嘿，提姆在哪兒?

1391
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,699
提姆和泰德在旅行 

1392
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,910
在一起嗎?他們結合 

1393
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,995
好吧，時間差不多了 是的 

1394
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,206
我只希望提姆能及時回來參加選美 

1395
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,669
哦,為什麼……他為什麼不去呢?

1396
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,712
提姆 提姆 

1397
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:53,755
哦 

1398
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,881
就是提姆什麼時間?

1399
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,383
發問吧 好的 

1400
01:01:56,424 --> 01:02:04,808
好吧，馬科斯，提姆，時間就像一個黑洞，在那裡像現實和準時之類的東西會消失 

1401
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:06,267
哦 

1402
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,062
泰貝莎的父親想像力很豐富 

1403
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,814
這是一件好事 

1404
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:12,524
是的,這是一個…我得說這是件好事 

1405
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,902
還記得他說我們老闆想綁架我們嗎?

1406
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,445
他嗎?

1407
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:21,700
或者他的小弟弟能夠走路和說話，但只有在我們不注意的時候 

1408
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,831
哇 轉身 

1409
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,042
的爸爸 

1410
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,753
泰德自己也挺難對付的 

1411
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:36,089
哦，他可能很…緊張 

1412
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,882
是的 高度緊張的 

1413
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:40,301
哦 還記得他起訴我們那次嗎?

1414
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:43,054
青少年 啊 

1415
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,306
不過他真的很尊敬他哥哥 

1416
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:47,475
他嗎?哦,是的 

1417
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:49,310
他不肯放過他 

1418
01:02:49,352 --> 01:02:50,937
提姆做的每件事，泰迪都想做 

1419
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:52,480
真的嗎?是的 

1420
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:54,607
我們叫他塔格隆·泰迪

1421
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:56,776
當然不是當面 不,不 

1422
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,029
不是當著他的面 他很愛打官司 

1423
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,281
但你知道嗎?你爸爸並不介意 

1424
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:03,324
他為他的小弟弟感到驕傲 

1425
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:05,160
哦,是的 他喜歡炫耀他 

1426
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,871
他們做什麼都在一起 

1427
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:09,956
他們是最好的朋友 

1428
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,708
就像你我一樣 

1429
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,460
蒂娜?

1430
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,794
永遠最好的朋友 

1431
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,129
逗怪物!

1432
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,298
這是如此甜蜜 

1433
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,474
這是我的壁櫥 

1434
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,309
哦，好酷的衣櫥 這是我的床 

1435
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,269
這是我的魚 

1436
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:35,023
嘿，想看看非常非常酷的東西嗎?當然 

1437
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,984
我為霍金醫生做了這個發聲器 

1438
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:41,738
嗨,我的老…你幹了什麼?這一點 

1439
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,907
打個招呼吧，霍金博士 

1440
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:50,497
Hellllll……他有表現焦慮 

1441
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:51,915
嗯哼 是的 

1442
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:53,583
哦，這是小羊羔 

1443
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,126
嘿,羊肉羊肉 

1444
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:57,837
那是我的星系模型就在我的架子上 

1445
01:03:57,879 --> 01:04:00,048
我的本周科學家獎 

1446
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,925
哇 我的晶洞石收藏 

1447
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,510
我的望遠鏡 

1448
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:04,678
甜的 

1449
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,013
嘿,酷的吉他 是的 

1450
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,056
這是我爸爸的 

1451
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:09,933
酷爸爸 

1452
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:11,226
你還好嗎?

1453
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,520
是啊，我覺得我高多了 

1454
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,731
如果你願意，我可以幫你唱歌 

1455
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,025
不,你不能 

1456
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,694
你的耳朵會流血的 哦,謝謝 

1457
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,362
它會很有趣 

1458
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,948
這個怎麼樣?這是一個經典 

1459
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:27,033
我們一定要去嗎?

1460
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:29,369
來吧 讓我們試一試 

1461
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,122
好吧 

1462
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:34,749
不過情況不會很好 

1463
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:35,917
沒有判斷 

1464
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,460
我們只是在找樂子 

1465
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:46,469
(沒有一個地方像家一樣 

1466
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:48,638
假期

1467
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,598
請停止 

1468
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,227
不,停止 啊…!因為沒關係

1469
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:56,896
你已經漫遊到多遠的地方…

1470
01:04:58,356 --> 01:05:00,066
好…試一試 

1471
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:02,736
啊!我太緊張了 

1472
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,738
沒關係 

1473
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:10,243
聽著，你要做的就是想像你在這首歌裡 

1474
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:14,080
歌詞裡的一切都發生在你身上 

1475
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:17,250
你可以看到筆記 

1476
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,800
如果你想大聲唱，那就大聲唱

1477
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:29,387
如果你想要自由，那就自由吧

1478
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:32,766
哇 哇!因為有成千上萬的事情要做

1479
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:35,435
你知道有 哇馬科斯,等等 

1480
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:37,187
來吧 

1481
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:41,441
如果你想唱高，就唱高  太高了一點如果你想

1482
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,443
低唱，低唱 哇

1483
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:45,111
我得到了你 

1484
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:49,115
因為有無數種方法可以去  你知道的

1485
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:50,533
我的天，那太多了 

1486
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:54,496
嗯，很簡單

1487
01:05:54,537 --> 01:05:56,998
啊哈

1488
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,626
你只需要嘗試

1489
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,548
你想唱什麼就唱什麼

1490
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,175
哇!是的，這很有趣!

1491
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:10,387
機會屬於你

1492
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:13,473
如果你按自己的方式去做

1493
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:14,808
哇 

1494
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:17,143
你今天就能做到

1495
01:06:17,185 --> 01:06:20,021
馬科斯,等等 你在哪裡?

1496
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,648
來吧 你可以的 

1497
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:24,526
我不能 我不能 

1498
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,996
現在開始吧 

1499
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:38,832
啊啊啊

1500
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:43,628
哇 

1501
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:47,549
嘿 

1502
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:49,634
這很簡單

1503
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,052
Ahahah

1504
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:54,681
你只需要嘗試

1505
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,433
好吧 輪到我了 

1506
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:58,393
我們開始吧 這都是你的 

1507
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:01,354
如果我想大聲唱，那就大聲唱

1508
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:03,064
唱出來 是的，讓它出來 

1509
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,983
如果我想要自由，那就自由吧

1510
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,359
有空

1511
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:08,570
因為有成千上萬的事情要做

1512
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:10,947
我知道有，我知道有

1513
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:13,408
我知道有 你知道有

1514
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,369
我知道… 你知道…

1515
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:19,956
我知道有 你知道有

1516
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:24,085
我知道有 

1517
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:30,133
哇 太棒了 

1518
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,676
不，你太棒了 

1519
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:32,844
謝謝,馬科斯 

1520
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,262
什麼?

1521
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:35,722
哦，這是一個值得擁有的東西 他們能看見我們 

1522
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:36,931
他們能看見我們 哦 

1523
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:38,224
夥計們,來吧 

1524
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:40,393
停止 不,這樣做 這樣做 

1525
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:42,354
哦,不 

1526
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:44,647
的父母,對嗎?

1527
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:46,900
再見，坦普爾頓一家!再見 

1528
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:48,568
再見,馬科斯 光速 

1529
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,611
奇怪的孩子 

1530
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:51,321
是的，我不喜歡他 

1531
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,326
吸引我的目光

1532
01:07:57,118 --> 01:07:59,788
牽著我的手

1533
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:02,290
這種聯繫比我們更緊密

1534
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:04,000
你去搞定他們，泰貝莎 

1535
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,169
曾計劃過

1536
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:09,047
給我勇氣

1537
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:10,674
這樣我就可以降落了……

1538
01:08:10,715 --> 01:08:15,929
接電話，接電話，接電話，接電話，接電話，接電話 Choochoo !

1539
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,264
難道他們不明白這就是世界的命運嗎?

1540
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:20,350
我一直在等待!

1541
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:22,435
所有操作員目前都在打盹 

1542
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,979
我等了這麼久，我的牙都長出來了 

1543
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:27,440
在我那個年代，我們寫備忘錄 

1544
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:29,067
很可愛，很老式 

1545
01:08:30,443 --> 01:08:32,445
我為未來哭泣 

1546
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,948
你想在我等電話的時候談談你的感受嗎?

1547
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:36,116
我可以給你20分鐘 

1548
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:37,409
不 

1549
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,035
我們來看看最關鍵的部分 

1550
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:40,537
你在害怕什麼?

1551
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:44,416
鯊魚，被箭射中頭部，還有…美國國稅局 

1552
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:45,959
就是這樣 你走 

1553
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,460
有那麼難嗎?嬰兒的步驟 

1554
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,462
那麼，孤獨呢?

1555
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:51,339
我不孤獨 嗯 

1556
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:53,800
我只是…一個人 

1557
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:55,301
有一個區別 

1558
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:58,596
我想你該看看你的檔案了 Ahahahah 給我 

1559
01:08:58,638 --> 01:09:00,015
哇 這是它嗎?

1560
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:02,517
它很薄 

1561
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:06,021
親愛的老闆寶貝，我向你保證:

1562
01:09:06,062 --> 01:09:08,732
每天早上你醒來的時候，我都會在你身邊 

1563
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:11,484
每天晚飯的時候，我都會在 

1564
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:15,405
每個生日聚會，每個聖誕節早晨，我都會去 

1565
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:18,825
年復一年 

1566
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:23,788
你和我永遠是兄弟 

1567
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,707
總是這樣 

1568
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:28,501
讓我想做個鬼臉 

1569
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,508
我們只是孩子 

1570
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,094
我們對現實世界一無所知 

1571
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,638
最終，你得長大 

1572
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,434
雖然你們長大了，但並不意味著你們就得分開 

1573
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,103
我不知道 也許已經太遲了 

1574
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:49,105
嘿 

1575
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:50,357
對不起,我遲到了 

1576
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:51,941
爸爸!

1577
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:53,151
爸爸,爸爸 

1578
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:54,402
這是怎麼呢

1579
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,904
泰德叔叔真的很想你 

1580
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:58,281
那不是很好嗎?

1581
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:03,870
嘿，你在幹嘛?

1582
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:08,583
哦，我在…我不知道，我只是在研究這個 

1583
01:10:12,837 --> 01:10:15,632
我很抱歉我在課間說了那些話 

1584
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,259
在操場上發生的事就留在操場上 

1585
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,178
我只是擔心泰貝莎，你知道嗎?

1586
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,554
她是你的女兒 我明白了 

1587
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:25,642
一直以來，我都在想我想要什麼而不是她需要什麼 

1588
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:27,811
我想我終於明白了為人父母的道理 

1589
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:28,978
給你金星，爸爸 

1590
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,647
繼續，老爺子 嗯，關於那個 

1591
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:33,775
阿姆斯特朗想要擺脫父母 

1592
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:36,111
對不起,什麼?他在計劃一場嬰兒革命 

1593
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:37,654
啊,來吧 

1594
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,906
就在我開始擅長做父母的時候 

1595
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,408
我們得阻止他 

1596
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:42,992
不是我們 你呢?

1597
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:44,369
我們都不是 

1598
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,037
接下來是寶寶公司 啊 

1599
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,206
所以呢，他們要派海豹寶寶來嗎?

1600
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:52,127
看起來像 所以你,嗯……你會被送回你的辦公室 

1601
01:10:52,168 --> 01:10:54,421
哦,是的 保持聯繫，提姆 

1602
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:56,256
喂?寶寶公司嗎?

1603
01:10:56,297 --> 01:11:04,347
謝天謝地,寶寶公司 嗯,BabyCo……WhaWhat嗎?你在說什麼，沒有足夠的證據嗎，嬰兒公司?我…啊哦 所以你什麼都不打算做?

1604
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,475
但是,寶寶公司,我……啊 好吧，那我們來處理 

1605
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,269
你知道嗎，嬰兒公司?

1606
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,687
我不幹了!

1607
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,814
真是一群喜歡嗅尿布的人 

1608
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,776
看來我們得自己阻止阿姆斯特朗了 

1609
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:19,362
我們要流氓 我喜歡它 

1610
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,031
任務又開始了?是的 

1611
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:23,825
如果你們倆能再容忍一下對方 

1612
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:27,120
我想我可以接受 提姆?

1613
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:28,121
我認為這是可行的 

1614
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:29,122
耶!

1615
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,582
被迫在一起了 

1616
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:33,376
這是下午8點45分 

1617
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:35,462
好吧 我們的時間緊迫 

1618
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:38,590
我們得在配方失效前阻止阿姆斯特朗 

1619
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:42,010
作為一個團隊，我們會在選美比賽上罷工 

1620
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,303
去,蒂娜 

1621
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:47,140
這個絕密文件…親愛的，是程序的問題 

1622
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:55,565
這個絕密項目揭示了阿姆斯特朗計劃向觀眾發表演講，他將在演講的最後做這個演講 

1623
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:58,193
我們需要人在後台 提姆,這就是你 

1624
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,862
如果我沒參加選美，我怎麼去後台?

1625
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,739
我的人會處理的 

1626
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:04,991
啊!謝謝 

1627
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,159
謝謝 

1628
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:07,243
不! 

1629
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:09,329
…走了 

1630
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:10,789
膠水 

1631
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:15,001
在那裡,在那裡 所有的更好 

1632
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,628
太棒了 

1633
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,090
現在，我要在聽眾中做你們的眼睛和耳朵 

1634
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:27,514
我不能讓媽媽看到我說話，否則她會尖叫著擁抱我，但這些小玩意能讓你聽懂我的嬰兒語 

1635
01:12:27,555 --> 01:12:29,182
它被稱為GAGA設備 

1636
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,558
哦,很可愛 出來 

1637
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,103
爸爸，你能聽到我說話嗎?

1638
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:34,354
也可愛 

1639
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:38,483
與此同時，有了我的新紫色身份，我可以離阿姆斯特朗很近 

1640
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,527
嗯，那是眉毛 

1641
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:45,907
哦 對不起 呃，不，那是，呃…等時機成熟，我會植入一個裝置 

1642
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,409
忘記它 忘記什麼?

1643
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,618
我是說，你可以的 

1644
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,662
去抓住他們，老虎 

1645
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:52,622
謝謝你們，家長們 

1646
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:56,042
謝謝你！有……我還想看到以前的熱情 

1647
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:58,420
這樣我就能控制他的戰衣了 

1648
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:01,881
我可以讓mutonchops做任何我想做的事 

1649
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,177
我可以讓他跳舞 

1650
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:07,887
我能讓他跳起來 

1651
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:11,558
嘿，不，不，不 包括把自己暴露在觀眾面前 

1652
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:14,352
每個家長都會拿出他們的手機 

1653
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,730
別看著我 別看我!

1654
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:19,357
照片會像尿布疹一樣擴散 

1655
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,234
切入我們的披薩派對 

1656
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:23,194
Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof!

1657
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,404
有問題嗎?

1658
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:25,613
在泰貝莎唱完獨唱之後，對吧?

1659
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:27,115
泰貝莎後歌唱 

1660
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:30,785
現在我們只要坐好，放鬆，欣賞表演 

1661
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:36,082
家長們，歡迎來到我們的節日慶典 

1662
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:42,255
記住，在禮堂裡用閃光燈拍照是完全可以的 

1663
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:45,050
拍張照片 讓你的孩子知道你愛他們 

1664
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:46,593
好啊! !

1665
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:47,969
來吧,提姆 

1666
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:50,263
你答應過會來的 

1667
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:51,765
哦,對不起 這個座位有人坐了 

1668
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:53,725
是的 對不起 哦,不 

1669
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,977
抱歉 我…對不起 

1670
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,104
對不起!我很抱歉 

1671
01:13:58,146 --> 01:14:00,440
泰迪叔叔，你就位了嗎?

1672
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:01,816
嬰兒在搖籃裡 

1673
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:04,486
嬰兒在搖籃裡 嗯 

1674
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,114
熊爸爸，你能聽到我說話嗎?

1675
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:09,741
雪花落下來了 

1676
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:11,826
就位!就位,大家!

1677
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:13,203
行去 我們開始吧 哦,我的天啊 

1678
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:15,121
這是開始 這是開始 最後 

1679
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:16,706
這是開始 這是開始 

1680
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:17,999
耶!

1681
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,126
你喜歡參加選美，是吧?不,不,不 

1682
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:22,671
我不是在說節目 我說的是生日 

1683
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:24,881
生日嗎?

1684
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:27,258
哦,是的 父母的手機裡已經有了 

1685
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:30,804
我教嬰兒編程 

1686
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:33,515
應用程序 他們正在編寫應用程序 

1687
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:39,312
但我的下一個應用程序…它會永遠改變世界的 

1688
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:43,983
QT Snap是一款將永遠改變世界的應用程序嗎?

1689
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:46,986
永遠從今天開始 

1690
01:14:47,028 --> 01:14:49,030
哦,很酷 

1691
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,662
哦 

1692
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,205
現在是冬天

1693
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:58,832
這是一年中最好的時間

1694
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:00,750
但是由於冰蓋融化

1695
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,836
全球變暖來了

1696
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:04,671
感覺像夏天 

1697
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:06,673
雪已經消失了

1698
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:08,341
這都是我們父母的錯

1699
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:11,261
所以我們都完蛋了 所有…

1700
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:12,721
注定要失敗的 

1701
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:14,347
這有點暗 

1702
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:15,682
孩子們剛剛是不是說我們完蛋了?

1703
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,684
我們看的到底是什麼?

1704
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,521
他們的腦子都快糊了 

1705
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:25,900
幾個月的催眠研究嵌入到有史以來最友好的照片應用程序 

1706
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:27,527
哦 

1707
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:31,364
現在我們要做的就是坐好，放鬆，欣賞表演 

1708
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:32,741
嘿!正確的 

1709
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:36,578
我馬上回來 我們,呃…嘿!…從地板上出來 

1710
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:37,954
嗯 

1711
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,041
排燈節!

1712
01:15:42,959 --> 01:15:44,544
拉斯維加斯波薩達斯!

1713
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:49,049
不可知論者!

1714
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:52,594
和光明節!

1715
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:53,928
你兒子很有天賦 

1716
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:56,222
你的也是 騙子 

1717
01:15:56,264 --> 01:15:58,725
蒂娜,進來 b日正在到來 

1718
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,268
一切都在手機裡 

1719
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,271
阿姆斯特朗在用一款應用給父母洗腦 

1720
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:07,567
我們必須停止表演 

1721
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:11,696
好吧,好吧 嗯,有一個…後台有個老式的大開關 

1722
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:14,741
爸爸，我們得拔掉插頭 

1723
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:18,411
爸爸,進來 爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸，爸爸 

1724
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,372
啊 他沒有回應 

1725
01:16:20,413 --> 01:16:21,706
當然不是 

1726
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,875
我自己來 停止!

1727
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:26,753
劇場的孩子 

1728
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:29,089
哦，來吧，耶穌誕生!

1729
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,465
看起來更神聖的!

1730
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:35,929
嘿,泰貝莎 

1731
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,847
別擔心，好嗎?

1732
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:39,766
你會做得很好的 

1733
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,060
謝謝,馬科斯 謝謝你的幫助 

1734
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:43,186
任何時候 

1735
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:45,271
我覺得你真的理解我 

1736
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:46,940
我很興奮 

1737
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:50,735
我等不及要看我唱歌時我爸的表情了 

1738
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,613
嘿!你在,鄧普頓!

1739
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:54,948
祝我好運吧 

1740
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:56,366
祝你好運 

1741
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:57,909
就這個而言，一兩個 

1742
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:01,538
我們在一起

1743
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:04,124
我們和睦相處……

1744
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:05,375
噓 

1745
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:07,460
提姆!

1746
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:08,712
那是小耶穌嗎?

1747
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:17,804
(我們必須停止選美比賽 )

1748
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:19,723
耶!什麼?不 為什麼?

1749
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:23,852
阿姆斯特朗要把父母變成殭屍好讓他們聽他的 

1750
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:25,979
什麼?你在幹什麼?不!

1751
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,773
泰貝莎在未來 

1752
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:32,819
你願意拿全世界的未來冒險就為了看你女兒唱歌?是的!

1753
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,531
我必須陪在她身邊 看看是誰擔心突然出現在這裡 

1754
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,158
這是什麼意思?

1755
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:39,826
你都沒來參加我的畢業典禮 

1756
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,286
噢!哪一個?

1757
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:43,747
商學院，法學院 沒有一個人 

1758
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:45,498
你都沒來參加我的婚禮 

1759
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,250
這一個嗎?我只有一個!

1760
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,918
我們說好了的，提姆 

1761
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,837
你答應過我會一直陪著你的 

1762
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:55,050
哇 你在哪裡……違反合同!

1763
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:58,845
哇 

1764
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,180
啊!啊!

1765
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,599
你們好嗎，夥計們?

1766
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,560
沒什麼能毀了我的生日 

1767
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:08,146
即使是你 

1768
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:14,319
哦,麻煩了 是的，很明顯從一開始你們就在一起工作 

1769
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,737
是什麼洩露了我們的秘密?

1770
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:21,534
我會說那些爭吵，那些瑣碎的爭執，還有嫉妒 

1771
01:18:21,576 --> 01:18:24,704
你知道嗎，你倆在任何方面都是兄弟 

1772
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:28,708
他們去了盒子 

1773
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,752
什麼?不 沒有盒子 不是現在 

1774
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:32,379
請 

1775
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:39,886
啊,只是……很遺憾，你再也沒有機會重新開始你們的關繫了，而且…不!．．．恢復你們曾經的親密感 

1776
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,554
對不起 不 

1777
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:43,807
不，不，不 不!再見,馬科斯 

1778
01:18:43,848 --> 01:18:46,893
Oohoohoohooh……

1779
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,770
哦,看,看 她就在那兒 

1780
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:49,938
我們的小天使來了 

1781
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:51,856
哦!斑貓在樹上 啊!哦!

1782
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:55,568
哦哦，哦哦

1783
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:57,362
Oohoohooh……

1784
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,786
你只有一個任務要做 

1785
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:06,788
一項工作 

1786
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,790
哦,不 噴泉 

1787
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:10,458
房間裡都是水 

1788
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,835
這不是暫停 

1789
01:19:11,876 --> 01:19:13,253
這是遊戲結束 

1790
01:19:13,294 --> 01:19:15,338
奧奧

1791
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,674
Oohoohooh

1792
01:19:23,054 --> 01:19:24,431
噓 

1793
01:19:24,472 --> 01:19:28,059
一，二，三，還有一，二，三 

1794
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:41,948
吸引我的目光

1795
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,118
牽著我的手

1796
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:50,457
我們之間的關係比我們預想的更緊密

1797
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:52,834
給我勇氣

1798
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:55,295
這樣我就可以降落了

1799
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:58,840
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

1800
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:02,927
所以我們站在一起

1801
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:06,848
和我一起歡笑和哭泣

1802
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,517
和我一起飛那麼高

1803
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:14,356
看日落和日出  世界在我們眼中看起來如此美好 哇 

1804
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:19,361
就像夜晚的月亮和星星

1805
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:23,031
你是對的 我搞砸了 

1806
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:25,158
我毀了這次任務 

1807
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,077
我是個糟糕的父親 

1808
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:30,080
你確實破壞了這次任務 

1809
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:31,706
但你是個好爸爸 

1810
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:33,166
不,我不是 

1811
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,793
我永遠做不到你的工作 

1812
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:39,714
我是說，你日以繼夜地工作，想辭職都不能，而且你連工資都拿不到 

1813
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:42,092
坦白說，我不明白這怎麼合法 

1814
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,260
我一直很嫉妒你 

1815
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:46,721
我也想成功，你知道的 

1816
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,056
當然,提姆 

1817
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:52,560
我賺了很多錢……但你組建了一個家庭 

1818
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:57,649
真相是……高處不勝寒 

1819
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:03,697
靠近我

1820
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:07,033
看天空

1821
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:11,788
你的餘生，我都會在你身邊

1822
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,791
航行海洋

1823
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,210
找到沙子

1824
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:20,797
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

1825
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:24,843
所以我們站在一起

1826
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:34,185
你知道,我……我很遺憾我們再也不見面了 

1827
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:40,066
一個非常聰明的人曾經告訴我，僅僅因為你長大了，並不意味著你必須分開 

1828
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,609
這是蒂娜嗎?哦,是的 

1829
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:44,571
她真是太聰明了 

1830
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,823
就好像她能看穿你的靈魂 

1831
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:49,743
很抱歉我錯過了你們的畢業典禮 

1832
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:52,454
很抱歉我錯過了你的婚禮 

1833
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:55,749
很抱歉我沒能陪在你身邊 

1834
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:58,668
肩並肩

1835
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,338
手牽手

1836
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:06,217
我們說的是一種別人無法理解的語言

1837
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:09,179
聽到那些歡呼聲

1838
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,473
樂隊開始演奏

1839
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:15,977
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

1840
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:23,193
所以我們站在一起 

1841
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:45,840
哦,泰貝莎 

1842
01:22:45,882 --> 01:22:47,300
外公嗎?

1843
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,010
娜娜嗎?媽媽?

1844
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:50,178
哦,不!

1845
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,097
哦，天哪，泰貝莎 

1846
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:53,973
你做得很好 

1847
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:57,227
你們真是太沒禮貌了 

1848
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,561
大家都來吧 

1849
01:22:58,603 --> 01:23:02,440
大家起立鼓掌怎麼樣?

1850
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:05,402
非常好 

1851
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:07,028
他們是殭屍!

1852
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,738
我們做到了!

1853
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:12,659
嬰兒革命已經開始 

1854
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,994
不再需要服裝了 

1855
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:19,124
誰想要蛋糕嗎?

1856
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:21,501
哦,我的天啊 

1857
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,087
生日快樂,每一個人 

1858
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:26,131
爸爸,泰德叔叔 

1859
01:23:26,172 --> 01:23:27,716
進來 你在哪裡?

1860
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:40,061
給你，姐姐 

1861
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:42,605
我已經用過這個了，所以我知道它是安全的 

1862
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,399
謝謝 

1863
01:23:45,775 --> 01:23:48,319
等等 你在說話嗎?

1864
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:50,321
我知道 這很奇怪，不是嗎?

1865
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:52,574
天啊，你說話了!

1866
01:23:52,615 --> 01:23:54,034
這是一個緊急情況 

1867
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:56,369
我在執行嬰兒公司的超級秘密任務 

1868
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,789
你是說爸爸的故事是真的?

1869
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,708
訴訟是這麼說的 

1870
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,917
我看起來怎麼樣?

1871
01:24:02,959 --> 01:24:04,336
沒門!

1872
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:08,298
我現在聯繫不上爸爸和泰德叔叔，所以我需要你的幫助，大姐 

1873
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,924
等等，等等 爸爸來了?

1874
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:11,426
他們一直都在這裡 

1875
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:15,764
(在嗎?我沒有太多時間解釋，但阿姆斯特朗博士還是個嬰兒 

1876
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,724
一個非常非常壞的孩子 

1877
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:21,603
很快，世界就會成為我們的遊樂場 

1878
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:27,817
啊!現在我們可以讓父母做任何我們想做的事 

1879
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:29,944
太棒了!是啊!

1880
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:32,906
沒有更多的規則 

1881
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:35,617
再見，媽媽和爸爸 

1882
01:24:35,658 --> 01:24:36,951
是的 

1883
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:39,412
媽媽嗎?爸爸嗎?

1884
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:40,413
爺爺?

1885
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:42,123
哇 你在開玩笑嗎?

1886
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:44,250
我們得在它擴散到全球之前把它關閉 

1887
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,419
是的 我們該怎麼辦?

1888
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:50,298
好吧，我們得找到控制父母手機的那個叫什麼來著的傢伙 

1889
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,841
服務器 是的 是的 

1890
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:54,010
學校裡有那種大的東西嗎?

1891
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:55,595
嗯,讓我們看看 

1892
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:58,765
服務器非常熱，所以你需要通風道 

1893
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:00,100
現在你的想法!

1894
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:02,310
在橡子上相交!

1895
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:04,646
A+來吧 

1896
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:06,106
這裡 

1897
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:08,358
機會敲門 

1898
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,944
首先，我們得去個短暫停留 

1899
01:25:10,985 --> 01:25:14,280
你的時間已經結束了 

1900
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:16,449
提姆，看起來就是這個了 

1901
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:22,455
至少我們還有最後的寶貴時光在一起 

1902
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:25,875
寶貝 寶貝!

1903
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,135
哦，對了 寶貝 寶貝!

1904
01:26:01,953 --> 01:26:03,997
這是我的女孩 

1905
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,165
謝謝你！

1906
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,418
蒂娜?

1907
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,836
蒂娜，蒂娜，進來 這是爸爸 

1908
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:12,213
爸爸!聽著，我們得關閉服務器 

1909
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:14,007
在橡子裡 啊 

1910
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:15,675
這太奇怪了 

1911
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:16,968
我要做副駕駛座 

1912
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,053
快，到橡子那兒去!

1913
01:26:18,094 --> 01:26:19,637
Hyah !
Hyah!

1914
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:22,349
Yeehaw !
Yeehaw!

1915
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:24,184
抓緊你的人，夥計 

1916
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:25,268
哇!

1917
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:32,901
哦,不!

1918
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:36,029
膠水!

1919
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:38,531
是的!僊塵!啊哈 

1920
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:39,949
是的,寶貝 是的 

1921
01:26:47,832 --> 01:26:49,209
哇……?

1922
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,419
我去哪裡來的?

1923
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:54,547
啊!我喜歡你的睡衣 

1924
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,428
你要去哪裡?

1925
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,888
Hyah !
Hyah!

1926
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,765
膠水 我很驕傲我是黃色的 

1927
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:05,058
我喜歡你的小馬 

1928
01:27:06,142 --> 01:27:07,394
謝謝你！

1929
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:09,396
什麼?

1930
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:12,315
啊,啊,啊 不,不,不 

1931
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:19,364
現在讓我們打開這個大堅果 

1932
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,534
哦,不 它即將走向世界 

1933
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:24,786
我們要怎麼上去?

1934
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,497
真的嗎?嗯，你有勇氣 

1935
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,124
我承認 

1936
01:27:29,165 --> 01:27:31,167
進取心,甚至 非常令人欽佩 

1937
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:33,336
但是，呃，很煩人 

1938
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:35,588
很煩人 是的 

1939
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:38,174
我得，你知道，呃，阻止你 

1940
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:39,426
粘住我，粘住我，粘住我 

1941
01:27:39,467 --> 01:27:40,969
寶貴的,原文如此 

1942
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:42,303
你太小，也太遲了 

1943
01:27:42,345 --> 01:27:44,431
啊,babad狗 

1944
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,767
學校不允許養寵物 啊!寶貴的!

1945
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:50,937
還有你，我的小矮子protege 

1946
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:52,272
快，快，快，快!動!動!

1947
01:27:52,313 --> 01:27:54,274
我給了你全世界 

1948
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:55,734
我們本可以成為搭檔的

1949
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:57,610
我有比搭檔更好的東西 

1950
01:27:57,652 --> 01:27:59,696
我有一個哥哥 耶!

1951
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:01,906
放手 不，你放手 

1952
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:04,117
哇 點 

1953
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,827
什麼?這是怎麼呢

1954
01:28:09,247 --> 01:28:10,457
嘿，那是我的休閒套裝 

1955
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:11,875
她穿起來更好看 

1956
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:13,376
舉起手來，放下尿布 

1957
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:14,794
事情要變得奇怪了 

1958
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:16,504
是啊，那是我的女兒們!

1959
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:18,465
真的是爸爸?是的 

1960
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:20,675
我跟那孩子說了很多話 

1961
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,469
真是一次家庭聚會 

1962
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,928
人越多越好 

1963
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,097
我們給你父母打電話吧 哦,不 

1964
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:29,309
啊哦 好的 

1965
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:31,644
媽媽和爸爸，我們擁抱他們擁抱到死 

1966
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:33,563
別擔心我們 進入服務器 

1967
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,482
加油，蒂娜，加油!

1968
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:40,362
嘿!你可以的，蒂娜 

1969
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:41,738
從那裡下來 

1970
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,490
去拿他的棒棒糖!

1971
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:45,825
別碰別人的小馬 

1972
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,287
在這裡 留下來 留下來 

1973
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:51,706
小炯，我們現在該怎麼辦!

1974
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,667
不要動 也許他們看不到我們 

1975
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,335
他們看到我們了，提姆 他們看到我們 

1976
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,711
你行動了嗎?我沒有移動 

1977
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:58,171
真的,提姆?

1978
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,006
哦 嘿，現在有點太高了 

1979
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:02,842
不要往下看 看著前方，好嗎?

1980
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,388
這是鎖著的 

1981
01:29:06,429 --> 01:29:08,181
我能幫你嗎?

1982
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:12,185
當然，我的意思是開玩笑，因為這隻手的作用是……作為一個關鍵 

1983
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,520
不,不 不,不,不 

1984
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,230
嘿,嘿 不，不，不 謝謝,姐姐 

1985
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:17,524
離我的服務員遠點 

1986
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,527
關掉它，泰貝莎 你在幹什麼?

1987
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:22,445
你在幹什麼?不,不,不!不!

1988
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,197
不要這樣做 

1989
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,573
哦,天哪!

你給我退後，小甜心

01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,215
哈!你的鼻子 

1996

1997
01:29:53,518 --> 01:29:54,769
…噢!哈!

1998
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:56,229
把他的街區打飛了 啊,貓糞 

1999
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:58,064
蒂娜，我想我知道了 是的!

2000
01:29:58,106 --> 01:30:00,233

看看你讓我做了什麼 火警 

2005
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:11,411
真討厭 爸爸!

2006
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,788
泰德叔叔!拉火警!

2007
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,415
姑娘們需要幫助 沒有想吻你!

2008
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:17,709
姑娘們需要我們 

2009
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:20,545
時間到了,半身人 

2010

偉大的飛奔的怪獸!

2011
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:27,093
什麼?什麼?

2012
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:29,346
提姆!快去看火警報警器!

2013
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:30,805
我會拖住他們 

2014
01:30:30,847 --> 01:30:33,099
下雨吧，寶貝 

2015
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:34,434
我會的 

2016
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:35,894
有什麼事嗎?

2017
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:37,479
你應付不了尷尬階段?

2018
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:40,982
去,馬科斯……哦,爸爸 走吧!

你把我妹妹放下來了 

2025
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:53,828
無論你喜不喜歡，生日總會到來的 

2026
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:56,122
你不能通過!

2027
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:58,041
你不能通過 

2028
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,751
不!停止流逝 

2029
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:02,712
是的,爸爸!

2030
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,172
路要走!

2031
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:07,884
就這些嗎?

2032
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:10,178
這是正確的 為什麼?什麼?學校的貴 

2033
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,306
我不得不削減開支 

2034
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:14,474
哦,不 這不是工作 

2035
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:15,642
你拉對了嗎?

2036
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:16,976
你還能怎麼做?

2037
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:19,020
你會發現我是對的 

2038
01:31:19,062 --> 01:31:20,647
我會告訴每一個人 

2039
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:23,817
父母的時代已經過去了 

2040
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:31,157
耶,耶,耶 

2041
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,827
你看我祝酒怎麼樣?

2042
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:37,122
敬嬰兒革命和我自己 

2043
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,627
該看糖果火山了…嗯,嗯 

2044
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:44,504
哦，那很好 世界末日的!

2045
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:46,506
你在幹什麼?你在幹什麼?

01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:48,008

你聰明 你強 

2058
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,543
你不需要父母 

2059
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,587
他們能給你帶來什麼?

2060
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:28,048
無條件的愛怎麼樣?

2061

01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:37,599
泰貝莎!

2064
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:43,021
我要下降!泰貝莎!

2065
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:44,230
掛在!

我以為我們都得長大 

2073
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,925
好吧，我們不要長大得太快 

2074
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:14,844
我愛您，爸爸 

2075

01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:18,973
哦 你看到了嗎?

2077
01:33:19,015 --> 01:33:21,267
而你想把這一切都奪走 

2078
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:22,769
那你要去哪裡?分離聚合 

2079
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:27,524
你知道嗎，醫生，童年不會永遠存在，但家庭卻可以 

2080
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:29,275
泰德叔叔!小心!

2081
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:31,069

萬歲!

2086
01:33:57,053 --> 01:33:59,097
萬歲!

2087
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:09,566
哦,甜蜜的 

2088
01:34:09,607 --> 01:34:11,651
找到的，謹守 

2089
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:17,699
媽媽，爸爸，我好想你 

2090
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:20,118
噢,噢,噢 耶!

2091
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,327
初級!

2092
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:23,121
膠!

2093
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,248
所以軟 

2094
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,708
我們要去哪裡?

2095
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,001
不壞,鄧普頓 

2096
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:29,753
啊!耶,鄧普頓 

2097
01:34:29,794 --> 01:34:31,254
是的,任務完成 

2098
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:34,424
作為獎勵，我們也阻止了阿姆斯特朗 

2099
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:35,967
嗯?什麼?

2100
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:38,845
我真正的任務是讓你們復合 

2101
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:41,681
A+ !課後見我 

2102
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:43,433
等等，所以你從來沒戒過?

2103
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:44,684
不 嗯 

2104
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:45,852
好了 

2105
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:48,730
我不喜歡把這兩者混在一起，但我想說這從來都不是生意 

2106
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:50,273
這都是私人恩怨 

2107
01:34:50,315 --> 01:34:51,649
你知道嗎，孩子?

2108
01:34:51,691 --> 01:34:53,943
你是我遇到過的最好的老闆 

2109
01:34:53,985 --> 01:34:55,570
謝謝你，頭兒 

2110
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:57,197

看看你穿的是什麼 嗯……親愛的,我哭了 

2114
01:35:05,246 --> 01:35:06,373
然後我的大腦一片空白 

2115
01:35:06,414 --> 01:35:08,166
哦,來吧 EveryEveryone聚在一起 

2116
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:10,043
這個…我們得搞定這個 我們開始吧 

2117
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:11,711
爸爸,不!不!什麼?

2118
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:15,632
我們知道

2119
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:17,509
分裂就會滅亡

2120
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:22,931
所以我們站在一起

2121
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:27,727
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

2122
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:35,235
所以我們站在一起 

2123
01:35:35,276 --> 01:35:37,112
耶,泰貝莎!這是美麗的!

2124
01:35:37,153 --> 01:35:39,114
觀眾都瘋了!

2125
01:35:39,155 --> 01:35:41,408
謝謝你！謝謝你！

2126
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:42,742

聖誕快樂,提姆 

2134
01:36:05,932 --> 01:36:13,148
很抱歉我不能陪在你身邊，但請好好享受這份過分奢華的禮物吧 

2135
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:22,115
你給了我最好的禮物 

2136
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:23,825
你 

2137
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:27,287

注:鴨子 

2139
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:35,462
當著你的面，萊斯利!

2140
01:36:35,503 --> 01:36:37,255
嘿 哦，開始了，琳賽!

2141
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:39,758
不 不，不，不 不要,不要,不要 來這裡!

2142
01:36:39,799 --> 01:36:40,967
我比你年輕 

2143
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:42,385
你才是更大的目標 

2144
01:36:42,427 --> 01:36:43,970
我打得太好了!

2145
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:45,472
不，你沒有

2146
01:36:45,513 --> 01:36:46,806
啊!你錯過了我!

2147
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,475
你和我想的一樣嗎?

2148
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:49,893
伏擊 確實不錯 

2149
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:51,353
噢!偷襲!

2150
01:36:51,394 --> 01:36:53,480
看到他們又吵架了真是太好了?

2151
01:36:53,521 --> 01:36:54,814
最後 

2152
01:36:57,817 --> 01:36:59,527
你不接電話嗎?

2153
01:36:59,569 --> 01:37:01,488
不，我們有家事要辦 

2154
01:37:01,529 --> 01:37:03,031
啊!是啊!

2155
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:10,372
蒂娜，我們有另一個任務給你 

2156
01:37:10,413 --> 01:37:12,123
我在聽 

2157
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:14,167
奶奶熱著回來了!

2158
01:37:14,209 --> 01:37:16,753
你要來點嗎，爺爺?所有人，去找塔格隆·泰迪!

2159
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:18,505
這是真的 問題!

2160
01:37:18,546 --> 01:37:20,215
你不能停止時間 

2161
01:37:20,256 --> 01:37:22,592
但每隔一段時間，你就會有第二次機會 

2162
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:24,386
我會抓到你的!

2163
01:37:24,427 --> 01:37:33,144
所以，即使你只是一個孩子…除非你做兩次小孩，老實說，這很奇怪，但重點是你總得長大 

2164
01:37:35,438 --> 01:37:38,149
你應該一直對你弟弟好 

2165
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:40,235
你真貼心，爸爸 

2166
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:42,112
這對我的報告很有幫助 

2167
01:37:42,153 --> 01:37:44,322
好吧,所以…就是這樣 

2168
01:37:44,364 --> 01:37:47,075
其實，還有一件小事 

2169
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:04,634
媽媽?爸爸?

2170
01:38:04,676 --> 01:38:09,097
哇……哦，我的兒子 

2171
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:13,685
你回家 

2172
01:38:13,727 --> 01:38:15,729
哦,是的 正確的 

2173
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:17,564
好的,老爸 現在 

2174
01:38:17,605 --> 01:38:19,858
最後 

2175
01:39:15,663 --> 01:39:18,458
吸引我的目光

2176
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,252
牽著我的手

2177
01:39:21,294 --> 01:39:26,633
我們之間的關係比我們預想的更緊密

2178
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:29,052
給我勇氣

2179
01:39:29,094 --> 01:39:31,429
這樣我就可以降落了

2180
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:35,016
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

2181
01:39:35,058 --> 01:39:39,104
所以我們站在一起

2182
01:39:40,188 --> 01:39:42,774
和我一起爬

2183
01:39:42,816 --> 01:39:45,819
分享我的夢想

2184
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,612
明天更美好

2185
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:50,907
比以往任何時候都要多

2186
01:39:50,949 --> 01:39:53,660
不要害怕危險

2187
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:56,037
制定大計劃

2188
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:59,708
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

2189
01:39:59,749 --> 01:40:04,629
所以我們站在一起

2190
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:07,799
和我一起歡笑和哭泣

2191
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:10,051
和我一起飛那麼高

2192
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:13,013
看日落和日出

2193
01:40:13,054 --> 01:40:15,724
在我們眼中，世界看起來如此美好

2194
01:40:15,765 --> 01:40:17,600
就像月亮一樣

2195
01:40:17,642 --> 01:40:19,811
還有夜晚的星星

2196
01:40:21,062 --> 01:40:23,815
讓你的頭休息

2197
01:40:23,857 --> 01:40:26,526
告訴我你的想法

2198
01:40:26,568 --> 01:40:29,779
我擁有的一切都是我的

2199
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:31,948
都是你的了

2200
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:34,743
航行海洋

2201
01:40:34,784 --> 01:40:37,203
找到沙子

2202
01:40:37,245 --> 01:40:40,707
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

2203
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:45,045
所以我們站在一起

2204
01:41:04,731 --> 01:41:07,275
靠近我

2205
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:10,362
看天空

2206
01:41:10,403 --> 01:41:15,575
你的餘生，我都會在你身邊

2207
01:41:15,617 --> 01:41:18,286
肩並肩

2208
01:41:18,328 --> 01:41:20,914
手牽手

2209
01:41:20,955 --> 01:41:26,670
我們說的是一種別人無法理解的語言

2210
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:29,172
聽到那些歡呼聲

2211
01:41:29,214 --> 01:41:31,633
樂隊開始演奏

2212
01:41:31,675 --> 01:41:35,053
我們知道分裂就會滅亡

2213
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:40,600
所以我們站在一起

2214
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,145
我們知道

2215
01:41:44,187 --> 01:41:46,773
分裂就會滅亡

2216
01:41:46,815 --> 01:41:53,988
所以我們站在一起 


1
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,176
(grand orchestral fanfare
playing)

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,660
(gentle melody playing)

3
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,097
* *

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,190
TIM:
<i>Time is a funny thing.</i>

5
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>-When I was a kid...</i>
-YOUNG TIM: One.

6
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,943
<i>-...the days lasted forever.</i>
-Two.

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,320
-Hide, hide, hide!
-Three.

8
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,946
-TIM: <i>But the years...</i>
-Wait! Over here.

9
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,281
<i>-...well, they went by so fast.</i>
-Four.

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,158
-Five. Six.
-Tim, no peeking.

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,493
TED SR.:
Yeah, no peeking.

12
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,952
-TIM: <i>Before you know it...</i>
-Seven.

13
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>-...you're all grown-up.</i>
-Eight.

14
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>-It even happened to me.</i>
-Nine.

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,291
Nine and a half. Ten!

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,502
Ready or not, here I come.
(grunts)

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>My name's Tim, and this...</i>

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,756
<i>well, this is</i>
<i>the rest of my story.</i>

19
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,466
-(roars playfully)
-Run for your lives!

20
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,134
(laughing):
No fair, Dad. You peeked.

21
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,928
(laughter, squealing)

22
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,097
<i>-They call me a stay-at-home</i>
<i>dad, which means...</i>-Let's go!

23
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,140
<i>...I hardly get</i>
<i>to stay at home.</i>

24
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,101
Buckle up, Templetons.

25
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,727
Ready?

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,437
-Set.
-Go!

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,856
(engine roars, tires squeal)

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,358
TIM:
<i>Now, some might say</i>

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,610
<i>I still have</i>
<i>an overactive imagination,</i>

30
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,072
<i>but being a dad is</i>
<i>the coolest job in the world.</i>

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,740
<i>Bunch of cool jobs, really.</i>

32
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,367
(laughing)

33
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>Sometimes I'm</i>
<i>a race car driver.</i>

34
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,162
CAROL:
Whoo! Daddy-o Andretti!

35
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,664
TABITHA:
Yay, Templetons!

36
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,290
TIM (Southern accent):
<i>Well, and then sometimes</i>

37
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,875
<i>I'm the best darn cook</i>
<i>in the county</i>

38
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,168
<i>and I deal out every meal.</i>

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,421
-Come on, Pa, hit me.
-(burps)

-(chuckles) Tina.
-(Tina laughs)

41
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,550
Whew, doggie!
And the house wins again.

42

-(thunder crashes)
-CAROL: Yay! -TABITHA: Woo-hoo!

43
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,929

-Spatula.
-Spatula.

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,395
Give my creature life!

-(growling)
-(Carol and Tabitha gasp)

48
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
She's alive!

49
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,985
TIM: <i>We have our ups,</i>
<i>and we have our downs.</i>

50
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,361
-(whimpers)
-No, no, no. Look. Look.

51
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,654
-Lamb Lamb's okay. See?
-Yay!

52
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,489
TIM:
<i>But we always stick together.</i>

53
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,658
<i>-My wife, Carol.</i>
-It's a miracle!

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
TIM: <i>She's the</i>
<i>breadwinner of the family.</i>

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,537
-(applause) -Thank you.
You know what they say:

56
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,247
-"It's all about the dough."
-(laughter)

57
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,166
And I couldn't have done it
without my husband.

58
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,751
He really rose to the occasion.

59

-It's the yeast I can do.
-(cheering) -Yeah, Mama!

TIM:
<i>She brings home the bacon, too,</i>

61
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,424
<i>while I keep an eye</i>
<i>on our new baby, Tina.</i>

62
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>(chuckles):</i>
<i>But sometimes, feels like</i>

63

<i>she's keeping an eye on me.</i>

64

<i>-And Tabitha...</i>
-Thank you!

65
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>...our little second-grader</i>

<i>-into the best school in town.</i>
-(laughter)

67
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,143
Yay, Tabitha!

68
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,644
TIM:
<i>We're so proud.</i>

69

<i>I still keep in touch</i>

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>to send inappropriately</i>
<i>lavish gifts</i>

82
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>-on special occasions.</i>
-(Tabitha squeals)

83
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,548
-OMG! Uncle Ted is the best!
-(neighing)

84
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,717
-(clatters)
-(Tim gasps)

85
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,885
(sighs)

86
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,345
TIM:
<i>All in all,</i>

87
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,263
<i>my life is pretty perfect.</i>

88
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,598
(insects trilling,
birds chirping)

89
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,850
<i>But all that</i>
<i>was about to change.</i>

90
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,894
(yelps, gasps)

91
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,145
Good heavens.

92
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,314
I'll save you!

93
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,316
-Ha!
-(Tina screams, laughs)

94
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,901
Thanks, babe.

95
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,319
Stay calm, Tabitha.

96
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,779
I'm coming for you.

97
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,783
I'm gonna save you
from the bubbling lava!

98
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,410
Dad, what are you doing?

99
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,829
Ew, gross. It went everywhere.

100
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,415
Come on, this is
the candy volcano of doom!

101
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,625
You used to love it.
(mimics explosion)

102
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,752
But I'm trying
to do my homework,

103
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,254
or I'm doomed.

104
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,006
Oh.

105
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,216
<i>Because if there's</i>
<i>one thing I've learned,</i>

106
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,926
<i>you're only a kid once.</i>

107
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,304
<i>Once you grow up,</i>
<i>you can never go back.</i>

108

(babbling)

109
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
Ee...!

110
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,312
(grunts)

111
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,983
(gasps) Oh, no.

112
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,737
Good night, Dr. Hawking.

113
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,828
Carbon, boron, beryllium,
lithium, helium, hydrogen.

114
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,913
Nailed it.

115
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,832
Boom shakalaka.

116
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,377
(laughs)

117
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,463
"Carry the four."
(chuckles) Gosh.

118
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,089
-TIM: Hey there, Tabitha.
-(Carol whoops, Tina laughs)

119
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,632
It's <i>The Good Night Show.</i>

120
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,552
Live from your bedroom,
starring Dad and Mom.

121
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,305
-And special guest, baby Tina.
-(laughing)

122
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,474
Good night, little Tina. Mwah!

123
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
Come back here, you.
(chuckles)

124
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,852
-Good night, Mom.
-Mwah!

125
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,520
Good night, sweetheart.
Mama's gonna kiss you.

126
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,980
-Mama gonna kiss you.
-(Tim clears throat)

127
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,190
* Good night song *

128
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,691
-* With your dad... *
-What?

129
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,318
What? It's time for
your good-night song.

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,028
Oh, no, thanks.

131
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,405
I'm listening to white noise!

132
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990
Helps me fall asleep!

133
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,159
(mimicking white noise)

134
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,370
Hey, what would you say

135
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,331
to me helping you rehearse
for the holiday pageant?

136
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,791
-(gasps)
-Yes! Right?

137
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,668
I can come to school with you,
and you can get

138
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,336
all your friends together,
and we can rehearse together,

139
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,338
go get some ice cream after.

140
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,423
-My treat.
-No! You can't do that.

141
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,467
Um, liability issues.

142
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,344
It's this whole thing.

143
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh. Right, right.
(chuckles)

144
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,931
Right.

145
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,558
Whoa. How about your favorite
bedtime story?

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,477
You know, the one about...

147
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,562
Uncle Ted was
a magical talking baby.

148
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,606
There was a rocket
full of puppies,

149
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,608
-and you saved the world.
-(shushing)

150
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,026
It was a good story, wasn't it?

151
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:04,072
Well, it didn't really make
a lot of sense.

152
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,865
The jokes were good, right?

153
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,325
Mm.

154
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
-Okay. Um...
-Dad.

155
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,662
(yawns)

156
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,039
My schedule is brutal tomorrow.

157
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,042
(grunting): Yeah. My schedule's
pretty brutal, too.

158
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,044
Oh, don't forget Lamb Lamb.

159
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,879
Good night, Lamb Lamb.

160
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,798
(kisses)
Good night, Uncle Ted.

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,634
I hope to grow up and be
a success, just like you.

162
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,928
Maybe we'll see you soon.

163
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,934
Good night, Tabitha.

164
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,938
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

165
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,607
Uh, okay.

166
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,152
I think it's time
we both grow up.

167
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,530
I look forward to greeting you
at the breakfast table.

168
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,830
Sweet dreams.

169
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,723
Hmm.

170
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,101
* *

171
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,443
Where has the time gone?

172
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,904
WIZZIE:
How should I know? (grunts)

173
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,698
-Wait, wait. I see light.
-(toy train tooting)

174
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,659
You, oh, out of my way.
(yells)

175
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,787
(gasps) At long last.

176
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,498
The sweet breath of freedom.

177
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,749
Wizzie?

178
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,459
You there,
what century is this?

179
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,795
(shudders)
Unhand me, vile ogre!

180
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,380
No, no, no, no.
Wizzie, it's me.

181
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,923
-It's Tim.
-(gasps)

182
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,883
Is it really you?

183
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,551
Come closer.

184
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,512
Let me see your face.

185
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,305
Closer.

186
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,391
Closer still.

187
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,226
Oh, Timothy.

188
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,477
It is you.

189
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,187
Hey! What was that for?

190
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,398
You cast me into
eternal darkness

191
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,317
and wreaked havoc
on my circadian rhythms.

192
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,652
I'm sorry, Wizzie.

193
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,320
Hey, but you look great,
though.

194
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,531
Except for the arm, you mean.

195
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,824
(chuckles)
I didn't even notice.

196
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,242
-You thought it.
-I mean, I noticed it,

197
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,868
'cause I... you obviously
don't have an arm. I-I...

198
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,787
You would never treat
Lamb Lamb this way.

199
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,581
Well, I... I gave her
to my daughter, Tabitha.

200
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,375
You have produced
an heir, Timothy?

201
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,710
Two, actually.

202
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,253
Two? Let the bells ring!

203
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,629
(bells jingling,
alarms blaring)

204
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,297
-No, no, no. Wizzie, stop.
-Yes! Yes!

205
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,174
-Wizzie, shh! Quiet, quiet.
-It's a time for celebration!

206
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,176
No, no, no. It's not
the time for celebration.

207
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,886
-Wizzie, shh. Be quiet.
-What? What is it?

208
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,805
-What is it, Tim?
-I don't know.

209
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,640
-(alarms stop)
-I guess I'm just not feeling

210
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,767
very celebratory right now.

211
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,686
Oh?

212
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,521
Tabitha. (sighs)

213
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,692
Man, Wizzie,
she's growing up so fast.

214
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,736
It's like she doesn't even
need me anymore.

215
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,322
Yes, first, they start
spending less time with you.

216
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,782
TIM:
Mm.

217
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,993
Then they stop coming
to you for advice.

218
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:55,994
Exactly.

219
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,121
Soon, they take you
for granted.

220
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,539
I guess.

221
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,499
-Then break your arm.
-What?

222
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,084
Then stuff you into a box!

223
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,045
Okay. Wizzie, you're...
you're not helping.

224
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,338
(Wizzie scoffs)

225
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,714
Okay, I'm just... I'm afraid

226
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,799
Tabitha and I
are growing apart,

227
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,886
like... like I did
with my brother.

228
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,596
Oh.

229
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,682
I thought we had
all the time in the world.

230
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,393
But you can't
turn back time, can you?

231
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,021
How dare you question my power!

232
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,441
-Turn back. Turn back.
-Oh, here we go.

233
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,069
-Oh, great wheel of li...
-Wait. (shushes)

234
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,904
-(Wizzie snoring)
-Did you hear that?

235
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,907
(gasps)
Never abuse the snooze button!

236
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,992
(shushes) It sounds like it's
coming from the baby's room.

237
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,994
What is it?
A creature of the night?

238
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,081
Witches? Is it the baying
of the hounds of hell?

239
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,415
Wizzie!

240
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,583
Don't go, Tim!

241
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,168
I can turn back time--

242
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,755
to the golden years,
when it was just you and me.

243
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,423
My good arm.

244
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,175
Don't open the door.

245
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,094
(fading in distance):
Remember last time!

246
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,638
(muffled voice
speaking indistinctly)

247
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,808
AUTOMATED VOICE: If you would
like to make a call,

248
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,309
please hang up and try again.

249
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,480
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

250
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,273
Thank you.

251
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,441
(whispers):
Hello?

252
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,026
If you would like
to make a call,

253
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,696
-please hang up and try again.
-Ah. Just my phone.

254
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,823
Get it together, man.

255
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,158
Oh, Tina, you little klepto...

256
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,244
Nighty night.

257
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,453
...maniac!

258
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,956
(rapid babbling)

259
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,124
Whoa!

260
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,876
Hi, Daddy.

261
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,962
T-Tabitha? Is that you?

262
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,213
(laughing)

263
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,631
(gasps)

264
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,675
(laughing):
You should've seen your face.

265
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,552
Oh, it's priceless.

266
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,053
You're... You... You-you...

267
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,472
(mock gasping)

268
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,974
You-you can talk?

269
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,143
Yep.
I'm in the family business.

270
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,812
(whispers):
It's a clip-on tie. (shushes)

271
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,106
You see, Daddy,
BabyCorp is more of what I...

272
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,774
Oops.

273
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,152
Daddy, Daddy, come in.
Can you hear me?

274
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,778
-Daddy, do you read me?
-(Tim groaning)

275
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,488
Daddy, how many fingers
am I holding up?

276
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,698
Thursday?

277
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,991
I should've given you
a warning.

278
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,534
I forgot you were an old man.

279
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,036
(yells, spits)

280
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,037
Wait, wait.

281
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,913
-You're from BabyCorp?
-Yes.

282
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,915
BabyCorp is more of what I call

283
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,751
-a side hustle for me.
-Uh-huh.

284
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,836
The point is I'm all in
on the Templetons.

285
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,338
-Go, Templetons!
-Oh! Okay.

286
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,173
You guys really know
how to baby a baby.

287
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,758
-I mean, it's incredible.
-Oh, oh. (chuckles)

288
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,343
Not that's it's all five-star.

289
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,345
-I have to say, you got
a lot of issues. -Sure. Yeah.

290
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,554
We'll talk about that later.

291
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,972
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe this.

292
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,141
Hey, want to go scare
the crap out of Mom?

293
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,101
-Daddy, please stay focused.
-(chuckles) Oh.

294
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,644
(grunts)
Right, right, right.

295
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,355
There's a crisis at BabyCorp.

296
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,481
What is it this time?

297
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,523
(gasps) Kittens?

298
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,650
No. This time, it's even worse.

299
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,902
-Worse than kittens?
-Yes.

300
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,695
That's why I volunteered for

301
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,572
-this supersecret assignment.
-TOY: Mommy.

302
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,491
Ooh, I want to help.
What-what do you want me to do?

303
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,034
That's the spirit, Daddy.

304
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,870
-You are exactly who I need.
-Yes!

305
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,663
To get Uncle Ted.

306
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,374
No. What?

307
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,875
What-What's with the face?

308
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,378
Daddy, BabyCorp can't wait
any longer.

309
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,671
All the pressure's on me, Pop.

310
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,881
When I volunteered
for this gig,

311
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,800
I thought it would be easy.

312
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,385
But you two never
see each other.

313
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,969
It's so sad.

314
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,180
It's like, "F-minus.
See me after class."

315
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,390
(gargles)

316
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,724
Sad? Uh, yeah, maybe.

317
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,934
A little. I don't know.

318
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,352
Did you forget to call him?

319
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,270
I noticed you can be
a little absentminded.

320
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,647
Sorry, what?

321
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,399
It's just that you tend
to procrastinate.

322
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,567
-You have to get him here for
the holidays. -(line ringing)

323
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,860
-No, I'm not...
-(ringing stops)

324
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,278
No, I'm not
gonna call him right now.

325
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,738
-Daddy, can't never could.
-No. -(line ringing)

326
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,115
Did you two have
a fight or something?

327
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,908
-No.
-But you're mad at him?

328
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,202
-Stop that. It's complicated.
-(ringing stops)

329
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,329
-Why? Do you need help using
your phone? -(line ringing)

330
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,081
-No, I don't need help
using my... -(ringing stops)

331
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,624
-Okay. What's the problem?
-(sighs) -(line ringing)

332
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,126
What's the issue?
Talk to me.

333
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,877
-There's no point, okay?
-(ringing stops)

334
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,921
I call him. I invite him.
He never shows up.

335
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,923
He's always got a work meeting
or a business trip

336
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,591
or a conference call.

337
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,468
All he cares about is work.

338
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,431
But after a while, you...
you just stop trying.

339
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,641
-He's still your brother.
-(line ringing)

340
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,935
You were partners.

341
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,687
-Yeah, I guess sometimes
you just... -(ringing stops)

342
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,816
you grow up and grow apart.

343
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,902
-(line ringing)
-(gasps)

344
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,571
Daddy, don't say no.

345
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,989
What if everybody said no?

346
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,157
Nothing would happen.

347
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,575
Nothing would get
off the ground.

348
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,909
You got to wake up every day

349
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,703
and you got to say,
"Yes, yes, yes!"

350
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,123
Surprise me. Say yes.

351
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,291
(sighs)

352
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,167
(ringing stops)

353
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,794
This is really disappointing.

354
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,088
-And now I'm getting mad!
-It's late.

355
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,174
We can work on this
tomorrow, okay?

356
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,884
-(grunts)
-(toy squeaks)

357
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,803
Oh. Whoopsie.
Your little horsey fell off.

358
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,348
Another day won't hurt, right?

359
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,850
Good night, sweetie.

360
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,602
-(door closes)
-(scoffs)

361
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,188
(tape rewinding)

362
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,647
TIM (recorded):
Good night, sweetie.

363
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,483
-...horsey fell off.
-(rewinding)

364
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,151
Tabitha?

365
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,406
* *

366
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,999
(low rumbling,
objects rattling)

367
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,503
Huh?

368
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,380
(gasps, squeals)

369
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,437
* *

370
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,409
Uh, don't worry. I got it.

371
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,285
-(Tim yells, groans)
-Where is she? Where is she?

372
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,037
-Where's who? What?
-I came as fast as I could.

373
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,580
-Ted?
-I canceled all my meetings.

374
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,541
What are you doing here?
(grunts) Why are you yelling?

375
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,792
-Where's Tabitha?
-Tabitha?

376
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,210
-Where is she, Tim?
-CAROL: Ted.

377
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,878
Uncle Ted, you're here!
You're really here.

378
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,463
-Which arm is it?
Left or right? -Huh?

379
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,382
-Is it your fibula? Talk to me.
-Whoa.

380
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,050
-Good dilation. Open up.
-(groans)

381
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,969
-Say, "Ah." Are you okay?
-Wh-What are you doing?

382
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,262
-You look okay.
-Whoa.

383
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,055
Don't worry.
I'm fine, Uncle Ted.

384
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,391
-That's my girl.
-Woo-hoo.

385
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,018
Uh, wh-what brings you
into town?

386
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,394
Well, Tabitha fell
off her pony.

387
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,229
-She did?
-She did?

388
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,230
I did?

389
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,399
-Tim left me a voice mail.
-He did?

390
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,942
-I did?
-You did.

391
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,861
TIM (cobbled from recording):
Hello. This is your brother.

392
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,571
Help. Tabitha fell off horsey.

393
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,822
Good night, sweetie.

394
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,490
Well, that was unsettling.

395
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,077
I swear I didn't
leave that message.

396
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,164
-(coos)
-On... purpose.

397
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,290
I...

398
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,291
Butt-dialed?

399
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,792
(chuckles)
With my butt.

400
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,169
While I was talking
in my sleep.

401
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,754
I do that sometimes.

402
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,380
You sleep-butt-dialed me?

403
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,467
-With my butt.
-(Carol chuckling)

404
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,887
I knew there must be a
perfectly logical explanation.

405
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,680
(chuckles)
And there it is.

406
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,599
-TED: Hmm. -All that matters
is that you're here.

407
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,809
-TABITHA: Woo-hoo! Yay!
-(Tina squeals)

408
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,269
-Absolutely. Uh, for now.
-(Tina giggling)

409
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,271
Uncle Ted, please stay
for Christmas. Please.

410
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,940
Sorry, sweetie. I can't
do Christmas on the 25th.

411
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,193
But, Uncle Ted,
I missed you so much.

412
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,944
<i>(echoing):</i>
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

413
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,613
<i>-I missed you so much.</i>
-Mm... wah!

414
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,573
TABITHA: <i>Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

415
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,283
<i>(echoing): Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

416
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,951
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>I'm a little old for that now?</i>

417
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,995
(chuckles) Can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

418
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,373
Alone.

419
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,377
-TED: The baby, Tim?
-(shushes)

420
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,046
She's been sent from up there.

421
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,715
-Upstairs?
-That's right. BabyCorp.

422
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,260
So you're saying the voice mail
was some kind of call for help.

423
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,262
Yes! No.

424
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,182
She comes from a secret
corporation run by babies.

425
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,144
Tim, I'm gonna give you
the name of a doctor.

426
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,981
Roy Federman. Just tell him
I sent you, okay?

427
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,233
(hushed):
What are they saying?

428
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,734
We should give them
some privacy.

429
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,027
-Here you go.
-Ooh. Thanks.

430
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,362
TIM:
I'm not crazy!

431
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,114
You just don't remember.
Tell him, Tina.

432
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,448
-He... I...
-TED: She can't talk, Tim.

433
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,158
-TIM: Stop interrupting.
-(Tina groans)

434
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,493
TED: Interrupting what?
I don't hear anything.

435
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,662
Except your obnoxious voice.
You hear that.

436
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,831
I have a beautiful voice.

437
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,249
-(groans)
-TIM: Fine.

438
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,126
I can prove that
everything I'm saying is real.

439
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,502
-TED: Oh, yeah?
-TIM: Yeah!

440
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,503
Suck it, Ted.

441
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,546
I beg your pardon?

442
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,672
You, suck.

443
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,132
No, no, Tim. You suck.

444
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,508
CAROL: Time to go buy
a Christmas tree.

445
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,218
But we already have
a Christmas tree.

446
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,429
-No, we don't. No, we don't.
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

447
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,014
Suck it, suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it, suck it.

448
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,557
-Get that pacie out of my face!
-Excuse me.

449
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,685
I hate to interrupt,
but may I make a suggestion?

450
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,061
Why don't you both suck it?

451
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,022
-Ha! (whoops)
-(grunts)

452
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,815
(grunting)

453
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,817
-She can talk.
-A lot.

454
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,985
(whoops)

455
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,611
Buckle up, boys.

456
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,238
(sucking rapidly)

457
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,532
(all screaming)

458
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,868
-TINA: Baby on board!
-(Tim whooping)

459
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,078
-That's what I'm talking about!
-(laughs) Woo-hoo!

460
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,497
(screaming)

461
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,042
(sighs)

462
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,586
* *

463
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,595
TIM:
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

464
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,056
(both grunt)

465
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,724
(yelps)

466
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,768
-Wow.
-(Tina laughs)

467
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,394
(gasps)

468
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,729
I'm home.

469
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,022
TIM:
Yeah. See?

470
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,482
It's all real.

471
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,566
TED:
Whoa.

472
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,735
Is that me?

473
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,488
TINA: If you're fishing for
a compliment, you caught one!

474
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,907
You are a legend in this joint.

475
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,408
A statue?

476
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,952
Well, I did single-handedly
save the company.

477
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,496
Double-handedly.

478
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,914
(chuckling):
Right? We were partners.

479
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,040
Really?

480
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,750
I don't see your statue.

481
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,377
I still love you, Daddy.

482
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,379
TIM:
They got the head size right.

483
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,672
(ding)

484
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,924
TED: Take it from me,
you have to be aggressive

485
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,217
if you want to get ahead.

486
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,927
Climb that corporate ladder

487
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,596
-until you're the last baby
standing at the top. -TIM: Wow.

488
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,557
Actually, I prioritize
a good work-life balance

489
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,103
and a positive environment
where my ideas are valued.

490
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,271
(laughing)

491
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,648
Oh, you're serious.

492
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,525
You're funny, Uncle Ted.

493
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,777
I wonder why they didn't
mention that in your file.

494
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,945
My file?

495
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,488
-You saw my file?
-(Tim sighs)

496
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,781
-Yep.
-What does it say?

497
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,116
It says a lot.

498
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,535
-This is the Crisis Center.
-Whoa. Wow.

499
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,037
This is where we monitor
all threats

500
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,039
to babies around the world.

501
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,332
And Hawaii.

502
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,126
This is so cool.
This is so cool.

503
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,128
(roaring):
I'm Godzilla.

504
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,671
"Oh, run for your lives!
Run for your lives!"

505
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,048
-Why did we bring him?
-Daddy, get down from there.

506
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,801
-Aw. -We can play on it later
when no one is looking.

507
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,511
-What's the crisis?
-Yeah.

508
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,138
Here we go.
What's the crisis, sweetie?

509
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,556
Rusty, roll it.

510
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,474
(snores, whines)

511
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,476
He's new.

512
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:07,313
DR. ARMSTRONG (over speakers):
Just imagine, baby surgeons.

513
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,649
-(buzzer sounds) -Uh-oh.
-(babies giggling)

514
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,985
Or baby astronauts.

515
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,155
(singsongy):
Floaty, floaty, float.

516
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,491
Yes, babies are gonna
run the world one day.

517
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,745
And that day is coming
sooner than you think.

518
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,748
Hello. My name is
Dr. Erwin Armstrong,

519
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,334
founder of The Acorn Center
for Advanced Childhood.

520
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,294
Wait a minute, that's...
that's Tabitha's school.

521
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,671
Here at the center,
we believe babies

522
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,299
are the ultimate
learning machines.

523
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,259
Isn't that right,
little Nathan?

524
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,428
-Yeah!
-(chuckles): Okay.

525
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,013
They should use
their precious time

526
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,474
to develop faster, push harder.

527
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,892
-Hmm. -(Tim scoffs)
-Parents, they have the best

528
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,853
intentions, of course,
but they're not experts.

529
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,982
After all, the only thing
holding your child back is...

530
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,776
-you.
-KIDS: You!

531
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,487
This explains why Tabitha's
been pulling away from me.

532
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,405
-It's the school.
-ARMSTRONG: Everybody, wave.

533
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,990
-Bye, Mommy.
-KIDS: Bye, Mommy!

534
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,241
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, Daddy!

535
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,869
(singsongy):
Sayonara.

536
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,954
Now, in the past six months,

537
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,957
these schools have been
popping up all over the world.

538
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,209
Uh, so what's the problem?

539
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
The school is the problem.

540
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,337
Yeah. School is evil.

541
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,547
No, Daddy,
not all schools are evil.

542
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,675
-It's just this one, okay?
-Okay.

543
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,802
If Armstrong's philosophy
keeps spreading,

544
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,970
it could be
the end of childhood.

545
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,430
No.

546
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,766
Childhood was the worst
three years of my life.

547
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,351
That's so sad.

548
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,228
You probably just
didn't do it right.

549
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,521
-Huh?
-Aw.

550
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,773
But luckily, you get a do-over.

551
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,983
A second chance.

552
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,655
BabyCorp has developed
a new super-duper baby formula

553
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,574
-that can turn a grown-up
back into a baby. -(baby coos)

554
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,910
We have it in cherry, grape,
orange and lime.

555
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,704
-For real?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

556
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,664
-You want me to be a baby?
-Hey, it's what you do best.

557
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,791
So you can infiltrate
the school and find out

558
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,502
what Dr. Armstrong
is really up to.

559
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,088
BabyCorp will
take care of the rest.

(Tim gasps, laughs)

562
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,593
It's the perfect disguise.

563
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,555
And it only lasts
48 teensy-weensy hours.

564
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,348
Oh, I am in on the mission.

565
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,516
-Sorry, Pops.
-Ow.

566
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,393
-It's not your mission.
-Aw.

may cause drooling, babbling,

570
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,112
I think some guys at my gym
take this stuff.

daughter's school. -(screaming)

574
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,869
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

575
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,370
Daddy, no. Please stop.

576
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,788

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,417
What? It actually works.

this kind of thing! -Oh!

(glugs, screams)

583
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,134

Flock of Seagulls?

-Gotcha!

00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,642
You might feel very emotional,
have some mood swings.

Hey! (screams)

Ouch.
There's the awkward stage.

592
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,650
Now, the tea's hot, Connie.

You always have to be
the hero, don't you?

What's that supposed to mean?
(grunts)

595

Never see him...
(frightened whimpering)

596
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,825
All of a sudden,
he shows up with a pony.

She's my niece. (screams)

It's not personal.

It's business, Leslie.

I have to cut this short.

Um, upstairs now.

632
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,897
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

633
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,357
-(both grunting)
-CAROL: Push it. No, no, pull.

-Push it up.

-To the right.
-How come I have the heavy end?

637
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,072
CAROL: Because you're young
and strong, honey.

638
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,449
Little bit more.

639
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,616
-Me first!
-(grunts)

640
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,909

-Get off.

-Tim? Ted?
-Mom.

642
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,121
Get the cord. Get the cord.

643
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,414
Get the cord,
get the cord, get the cord!

644
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,124
You just can't disappear.

645
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,459
You need a cover story.

-TED: Ow!
-Oh, right.

647
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,086
My soft spot.

648
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,254
CAROL:
Where are you guys?

649
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,464
Uh, uh, tell her
you're packing.

650
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,300
We're upstairs, uh, packing.

651
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,760
-Packing? For what?
-(Tabitha yells)

652
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,511
Ooh. You're going on
a brother bonding trip.

653
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,097
-We're going on
a brother bonding trip. -Ow!

654
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,724
Now?

655
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,392
But, Tim, your parents
are coming tomorrow.

656
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,102
They can help out.

657
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,979
Yeah, they could help out.

658
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,899
What... No, you can't leave me
alone with your parents.

659
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,567
-(Tina yells, laughs)
-Oh, Tina!

660
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,236
(grunts)
What are you doing?

661
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,738
(both grunting)

662
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,948
All right, you know what?
You're going to baby jail.

663
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,784
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! -Tabitha!

664
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,285
-CAROL: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
-TABITHA: A little help here.

665
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,745
CAROL:
Honey, hold it up. Hold it up.

666
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,455
(deep voice):
This is Ted Templeton, a man.

667
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,165
You can go ahead and take off.
I have urgent family business.

668
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,376
-CAROL: To the right, honey.
-Yes, I have a family.

669
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,294
-Tim, I'm coming up there.
-(Tina gasps)

670
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,254
Yeah, we need to talk.

671
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,923
TABITHA:
Hey, Mom?

672
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,132
Oh! Tina!

673
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,550
(squeals, laughs)

674
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,594
Put that down.
Put that down. Put that down.

675
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,970
-Put that down. Put that down.
-Tina!

676
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,807
-Put that down! Get back here!
-(laughing)

677
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,309
Tina, stop! (grunting)

678
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,436
CAROL:
What has gotten into you?

679
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,146
-Time for us to go!
-(grunts)

680
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,648
-What? Now?
-TED: Yeah.

681
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,526
-My helicopter's double-parked.
-Bye!

682
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,695
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So soon? -Oh, no.

683
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,822
-(both scream)
-(wind whistling)

684
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,700
-(helicopter whirring)
-(panting)

685
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,869
What... Did they really
just leave?

686
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:55,995
Yep.

687
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,872
-Hide!
-(Ted and Tim whimpering)

688
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,917
(groans)
I got to lose this baby fat.

689
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,544
(Carol sighs)

690
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,671
Tina! What is your problem?

691
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,840
(Tina laughing)

692
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,925
* *

693
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,429
CAROL: Now, you're gonna
wake up tomorrow

694
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,055
and be good, Tina.

695
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,390
No more devil baby.

696
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,683
Deal?

697
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,019
-(coos)
-Okay.

698
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,064
(both gasping for air)

699
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,232
(both scream)

700
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,483
Ew.

701
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,943
(both scream)

702
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,195
-(chiming) -Thanks so much
for coming in, ladies.

703
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,530
Would you like some fruit?

704
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:31,573
Mm. Ow!

705
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,574
What was... Hey!

706
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,159
Uh, can we get on with this?

707
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,369
(grunts, groans)

708
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,038
I miss my teeth.

709
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,081
I've decided who's going
on the mission.

710
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,332
Thank you. I accept.

711
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,417
Both of you.

712
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,960
-Yes!
-No.

713
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,712
BabyCorp wants to get
the team back together, huh?

714
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:46,838
(laughs):
No.

715
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,214
They think that's
a terrible idea.

716
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,382
Of course they do.

717
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,217
Well, I'm the boss, applesauce.

718
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,220
And I think you two are better
together than you are apart.

719
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,515
Well, I work alone--
or at least not with him.

720
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,559
Hey. There's no "I" in "team."

721
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,561
Actually, there's no "U"
in "team," either,

722
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,772
-but there is an "M-E."
-T-E-A-M...

723
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,732
But teamwork doesn't seem work.

724
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,109
Ah. If you want something
done right, do it yourself.

725
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,653
-We're all in it together.
-Every man for himself.

726
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,405
One is the loneliest number.

727
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,282
-The ayes have it.
-We the people!

728
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,159
Aha!

729
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,745
Oh. So sorry.

730
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,163
(whispers):
Okay. Good night.

731
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,581
Whew.

732
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,708
Guess we'll just have to
melt down your big old statue

733
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,585
and turn it into
participation trophies.

734
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,420
Please, no,
don't hurt my statue.

735
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,507
Now, we have secret intel

736
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:35,637
that Dr. Armstrong leaves his
office every morning at 11:15.

737
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,138
You need to sneak in there,

738
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,391
plant these
surveillance devices,

739
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,434
and report back to me.

740
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,560
Oh, man, this is so cool.

741
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:43,728
(echoing over speaker):
Testing.

742
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,105
* Strangers in the night... *

743
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,607
Now, I've arranged
for a school bus

744
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,943
to be here at 8:00 a.m. sharp!

745
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,569
-Thank you, Connie.
-CONNIE: Nighty night.

746
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,071
Do not be late.

747
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,322
Got it.

748
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,282
Easy-breezy, taco-peasy, boys.

749
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,159
Let's get some sleep!

750
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,120
(snoring)

751
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,334
(coos softly)

752
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,714
* *

753
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,183
CAROL:
Hey, what's the matter?

754
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,936
TABITHA:
It's nothing.

755
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,312
CAROL:
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

756
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,647
I'm sure your dad will be back

757
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,315
in time to see you
in the pageant.

758
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,692
TABITHA:
That's okay.

759
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,068
CAROL: What?
Don't you want him to come?

760
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,654
-TABITHA: I guess.
-CAROL: Of course you do.

761
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,614
Now, go back to sleep.

762
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,033
TABITHA:
Good night, Mom.

763
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,368
CAROL:
Good night, sweetie.

764
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,919
(coos softly)

765
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,717
* *

766
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,181
CAROL:
<i>Don't you want him to come?</i>

767
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,099
-TABITHA: <i>I guess.</i>
-(gasping)

768
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,392
(screams)

769
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,770
Don't you think I'm
a little old for that now?

770
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,522
I think it's time
we both grow up.

771
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,107
-(grunts)
-(thunder crashes)

772
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,901
(gavel slamming)

773
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,613
The trial of
Timothy Leslie Templeton

774
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,031
is now in session.

775
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,407
-Ha! Leslie.
-(laughter)

776
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,534
Trial? Wait, what...
what are the charges?

777
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,869
Fraud.

778
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,538
Claiming to be
the world's best dad.

779
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,998
-But I never said...
-Exhibit A.

780
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,209
-Oh, come on. That was a gift.
-(gallery gasping)

781
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,253
I suggest you let
your attorney do the talking.

782
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,422
(gasps) Oh, no.

783
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,966
Back in my day, you had to
earn one of these babies.

784
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,259
-Dad, what? I did not...
-(gallery gasping)

785
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,054
His best friend was
an alarm clock.

786
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:41,846
Mom.

787
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,516
(groans) He broke my arm.

788
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,059
No, I didn't!
It was my brother.

789
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,227
Objection, Your Honor.

790
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,687
Sustained.

791
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,313
We the jury find
the defendant...

792
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,815
ALL:
A failure!

793
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,608
Tabitha, will you please
help me out?

794
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,984
Whoa!

795
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:57,404
Dad, the homework,
it's just too much.

796
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,571
-Whoa!
-Tabitha!

797
00:28:58,613 --> 00:28:59,781
-Time's up.
-(alarm ringing)

798
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,367
-Wait. No!
-Save me, Daddy! Save me!

799
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,619
(screaming)

800
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,204
(yells, gasps)

801
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,747
(sighs)

802
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,750
-Oh, man. That was crazy.
-(snoring)

803
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,627
(both yelling)

804
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,170
-We overslept! We overslept?
-(gasping)

805
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,880
-We overslept.
-Wake up, little halflings!

806
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,049
-Wake up! What year is it?
-(alarm ringing)

807
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,844
Oh, no.

808
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,595
This is bad. No.

809
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,264
No! No.

810
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,598
(yells) Get up.

811
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,933
Get up. We got to go.

812
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,810
Come on.
We're gonna be late for... Oh!

813
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,103
I'm gonna email it to you.

814
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,604
(grunts) What's going on?

815
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:33,898
Ah, I forgot to set Wizzie
for daylight savings!

816
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,943
-What?!
-Daylight can't be saved, Tim.

817
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,237
Oh, I got to get the plant
and the bug we got to plant.

818
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,114
-Grab whatever. We got to go.
-Don't panic. Do not panic.

819
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,657
-Ow. (groans)
-Godspeed, boys.

820
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:43,783
Let's roll.

821
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,286
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa...!

822
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,413
(grunting)

823
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,082
-(Tim screams)
-Upsies.

824
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,543
-I need upsies...!
-Oh!

825
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:54,961
-(Ted yells)
-TIM: Get dressed.

826
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,714
(both grunting and groaning)

827
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,341
What have you done to me?!

828
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,301
No, really?
What, are we going sailing?

829
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,470
Oh, no.
No, no, it's leaving.

830
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,804
(both yell)

831

(grunts, whimpers)

832
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,141
Wait, no, no. Stop!

833
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,310
Stop, stop, stop. Come back!

834
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,478
Ahoy!

835
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,812
Come back!

(panting)

837
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,024
Great, matey.

838
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,609
What are we gonna do now?

839
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,237

(slow-motion):
Oh, no!

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,921

(whinnies)

845
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,342
Precious, my noble steed.

846
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:45,512
We must not be late
for our first day of school.

847
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,641
Oh, gross.

848

-Huh?
-(Tim screaming)

849
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,687
Tallyho, Precious!

851
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,818
This pony hates me. Oh!

852
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,277
It's not that
she hates you, Tim.

853
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,862
She just doesn't respect you.

854

Go left! Go left!

857
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,704
I'm gonna go
where navigation says.

858

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Turn left.

859
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,289
Thank you, navigation.

-TIM: Sorry.

862
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,004
AUTOMATED VOICE: Turn left.
Proceed on the current route.

863
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,090
TED:
Yeehaw!

864
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:23,800
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Recalculating.

865
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:25,635
Hold on to your holster.

-Hyah!

Don't answer it.

-Hi.
-CAROL: Oh, Tim.

871
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,310
How's your bonding trip?

872
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,062
Uh... Whoa!

873
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,397
Whoa. Slow down.

874
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:40,191
How... is... your...

875
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,110
-bonding trip?
-Aah! Whoa.

876

I wish you were here.

00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,325
Oh, we miss you, too.

880

Don't we, girls?

881
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:51,870
We're, uh...

882
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,413
We're, uh, rebooting
our relationship

883
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,498
and, uh, restoring the
closeness that we once felt.

-Uh, a hockey game.
-Hey!

887

He shoots, he scores!

He scores! He scores!

889

Uh, no, not the police.

894
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,933
It's, uh...
it's a hockey alarm.

Faster, Tim.

896

I ain't going back

Happy holidays, coppers.

You're never gonna
take me alive, see?

Uh, he's busy.

00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,049
Hi. I-I'm new here.

1037
00:36:56,091 --> 00:37:00,261
Said nihonium to the other
elements in the periodic table.

1038
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,180
-Ooh.
-(laughter)

1039
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,723
Okay.

1040
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,392
Can't sit here.

1041
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,227
Or here. Or there.

1042
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,728
(yells)

1043
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,524
Seating position is
determined by class rank.

1044
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,651
We can't possibly
include your data,

1045
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:17,070
given that the rigor
of your previous school

1046
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,988
is an unknown variable.

1047
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,240
-STUDENTS: Ooh.
-(laughs)

1048
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,866
-Sick burn, Nathan.
-(grunts)

1049
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,118
-(groans)
-Ow.

1050
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,244
Here.

1051
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,413
-You can take my seat.
-(sighs)

1052
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,873
I'm so proud of you.

1053
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,875
I mean... thanks.

1054
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,377
Okay...

1055
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,920
(school bell rings)

1056
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,255
ARMSTRONG:
Good morning.

1057
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,673
STUDENTS:
Good morning, Dr. Armstrong!

1058
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,050
(chuckles)
Very warm welcome. Thank you.

1059
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,385
Huh?

1060
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,429
As you can see,
we've got a new colleague

1061
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,222
joining us today.

1062
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,724
-Ooh.
-Hello.

1063
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,517
New colleague, why don't you
introduce yourself.

1064
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,603
Uh, my name's Ti... um, Marcos.

1065
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,023
-Hmm.
-Marcos Lightspeed.

1066
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:55,608
Marcos Lightspeed.

1067
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,194
Yeah. Colorful, characterful,
and I like it.

1068
00:37:58,236 --> 00:37:59,821
-In any case...
-(gasps)

1069
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,449
-...welcome, Marcos,
to Blue Unit. -(gasps)

1070
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,242
Our most advanced class.

1071
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:07,078
Ooh, this is rarefied air

1072
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,413
-we're breathing.
-(groans)

1073
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,331
Here at The Acorn Center,
we believe

1074
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,417
that all competition is...

1075
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,961
STUDENTS:
Healthy competition.

1076
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,422
(babies yelling, laughing)

1077
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,841
(noisemakers blaring)

1078
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,890
I'm trapped
in the dum-dum holding tank.

1079
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:30,268
(gasps)
I'm having a panic attack.

1080
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,687
There must be
a way out of here.

1081
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,817
Something doesn't smell right.

1082
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,944
(sniffs) Blueberry.

1083
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,696
(laughing)

1084
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,907
(whispers):
I have to get out of here.

1085
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,158
Hi.

1086
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,659
Don't look at me.

1087
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,661
-Okay.
-(baby laughing)

1088
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,955
And our first subject
today is...

1089
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:53,083
No fractions, no fractions,
no fractions. Whoa!

1090
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,835
Particle physics.

1091
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,003
Yes! What?

1092
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,129
Yes! (laughs)

1093
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,631
Who knows which scientist

1094
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,883
first theorized
that the universe has a limit

1095
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,594
beyond which
the laws of physics break down?

1096
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,179
(students clamoring)

1097
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,931
Wow. Everybody seems to know.

1098
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:11,434
-(sighs, gasps)
-Señor Lightspeed.

1099
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,979
Um, Dr. Flam... baisley?

1100
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:17,857
-(buzzer sounds)
-Oh, that's the wrong answer.

1101
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,694
His brain sure doesn't move
at light speed.

1102
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:21,861
(laughter)

1103
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,488
-ARMSTRONG: Uh, okay.
-I know, right?

1104
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,365
-Anybody else?
-Right here.

1105
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,783
-Max Planck.
-(bell dings)

1106
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,284
ARMSTRONG:
That's correct.

1107
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,703
Tabitha has set the bar.

1108
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,413
First one on the board.
Ding, ding, ding.

1109
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,540
Way to go, Tabitha.

1110
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,042
You're going down, Templeton.

1111
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,502
Bring it on, Nathan.

1112
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,712
Yeah, Tabitha. Get him.

1113
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:41,256
ARMSTRONG:
Next subject.

1114
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,882
Ancient Greek.

1115
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:45,719
-STUDENTS: Opa!
-Oprah! (chuckles)

1116
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,887
-(laughter, babbling)
-Attention.

1117
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,764
Attention, everyone.

1118
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,475
Who wants to play Shawshank?

1119
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:53,977
-No!
-BABIES: Huh?

1120
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,981
Who wants to go outside
and play?

1121
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:01,109
-(cheering)
-Does that sound fun? Good.

1122
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,069
Now, anybody have any ideas?

1123
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,404
-BABY: No!
-Come on, people.

1124
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,530
Think, think, think,
think, think.

1125
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,781
We need to think
outside the box.

1126
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,241
-Oh, oh, oh! Me, me! Oh!
-You, Bo-Peep.

1127
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:11,327
We can build a hot-air balloon

1128
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,288
out of Popsicle sticks
and bubble gum!

1129
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,622
(laughing)

1130
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,332
And how would it fly?

1131
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,251
-Pixie dust!
-(laughing, cheering)

1132
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:19,794
Get back in the box, Bo-Peep.

1133
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,088
-All the way in?
-All the way in.

1134
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,299
-Yay! -Ooh. Uh, can we get
in the box, too?

1135
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,343
-Can we? Can we?
-BABY: Glue.

1136
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,303
I like glue.

1137
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,512
Who doesn't?

1138
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:30,972
But we're trying
to brainstorm here.

1139
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,265
Glue's good.

1140
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,975
(laughing wildly)

1141
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:36,770
-Think, think, think, think,
think, think... -(groans)

1142
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,939
...think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think!

1143
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,441
Bingo.

1144
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,776
Next subject.

1145
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:45,445
X is equal
to the derivative of...

1146
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:46,738
-NATHAN: Ooh, me!
-Itself.

1147
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,406
ARMSTRONG:
Kudos for Tabitha.

1148
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:49,908
Wow. You knew that?

1149
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:53,244
The world's leading producer
of bauxite is...

1150
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,746
-NATHAN: Oh!
-Australia.

1151
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,122
ARMSTRONG: Once again,
Tabitha's on the board.

1152
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,375
-Very good. -Yes, Tabitha!
-(applause)

1153
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,001
We got 15 minutes, people.

1154
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,170
The difference
in "try" and "triumph"

1155
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,963
is just a little oomph.

1156
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,092
-BABIES: Oomph!
-Go big or go home.

1157
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,718
Okay. Going home.

1158
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,512
-Let's pick up the pace.
-No!

1159
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,556
Hand downs, Norma Rae.
This is my time.

1160
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,725
To be, or not to be?
Tabitha.

1161
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,310
-To be. -That's correct.
-(bell dings)

1162
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:21,314
Can anyone tell me
the horsepower of a 302 engine?

1163
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,149
-Uh, seven?
-(buzzer sounds)

1164
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:24,901
-ARMSTRONG: Oh, boy.
-Weak sauce, Nathan.

1165
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,486
-That was weak.
-(groans)

1166
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,737
Tabitha, do you have
an idea about that?

1167
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,323
300 horsepower
with a four-barrel carb.

1168
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:31,616
-(bell dings) -TIM: Wow.
-(groans)

1169
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,493
-Her dad must be a genius.
-(applause)

1170
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,037
On my signal, unleash heck.

1171
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,957
-Fire!
-(babies grunt)

1172
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,544
-(babies cheering)
-Yes!

1173
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,880
-I found a cure!
-(cheering)

1174
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,674
-(bell dings)
-Yes! Yes! She did it!

1175
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:48,883
She did it.

1176
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,510
-(students gasp)
-(buzzers sounding)

1177
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,178
STUDENTS:
Marcos!

1178
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,472
I did it. I did it.

1179
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:56,349
(babies cheering)

1180
00:41:56,391 --> 00:42:00,270
Remember, your size doesn't
determine your strength.

1181
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,190
Well, so far,
it's Tabitha number one

1182
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:05,692
and everybody else last.

1183
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,361
-(cheering, applause)
-(groans, sobs)

1184
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,989
* *

1185
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:16,411
Psst. Hey, Tabitha.

1186
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,662
You're really...

1187
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,290
-A geek. I know.
-No.

1188
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,208
You're amazing.

1189
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,544
Oh. Thanks, Marcos.

1190
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,048
You'll be singing
a different tune at rehearsal.

1191
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,133
The wrong tune.

1192
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,343
(both laughing)

1193
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,635
You're so funny.

1194
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:34,346
Hilarious!

1195
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:39,392
And yeah, Templeton,
don't be late.

1196
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,102
-(laughs)
-(gasps) Late.

1197
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,229
-I'm late.
-ARMSTRONG: Next subject.

1198
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:44,439
Yes!

1199
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:46,399
(straining):
Just a little further.

1200
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:49,527
(babies giggling, babbling)

1201
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:50,737
Glue!

1202
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:52,572
(yells, screams)

1203
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:53,740
-TIM: Excuse me.
-(engine revving)

1204
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,033
Yes, Marcos.

1205
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:57,869
Can I have a hall pass?
I have to go.

1206
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:00,413
ARMSTRONG:
Voilà. Feel free.

1207
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,082
(scoffs) Now what?

1208
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,875
-(grunts) Now what?
-(babies crying)

1209
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,502
Glue!

1210
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:07,379
Glue is bad!

1211
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,089
(whimpering)

1212
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,256
Glue.

1213
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,717
(gasps)
Glue is good.

1214
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,096
How to get to
the principal's office.

1215
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,597
Of course.

1216
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,517
You get sent
to the principal's office.

What's up, y'all?

1226
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,541
School is...

1227
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,084
-stupid.
-(students gasp)

1228
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,837
(staticky): Listen, you know,
I acknowledge your anger.

1229
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:51,631
It's, uh, very, uh, feisty,
but please sit down.

1230
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:54,342
-Okay. Uh, no.
-(students gasp)

1231
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,137
Sitting is... stupid!

-* It's tricky, tricky... *

1237
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,235
All right. I'm afraid you can't
disrupt class any longer.

1238
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:16,031
Oh, no. Are we gonna have
a talk in your office?

1239
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:17,657
No.

1240

-STUDENTS (gasping): The Box?

-He's going in the Box.

No, the Box makes you crazy.

The Box?

Relax.

(sighs)
It's like they always say:

1259
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:02,160
If you want something
done right,

1260
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,871
you have to do it
without your brother!

1261
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,833
We meet again, doorknob.

Hello.

1265
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,842
Welcome, welcome.

1266
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:19,761
Please come in. <i>Entrez vous?</i>

1267
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,221
You're here.

1268
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:22,764
Oh, yes. I...

1269
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,974
I was expecting you.

1270
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,894
I... (grunts, yells)

1271
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:28,895
(button beeps)

1272
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,231
I expected that you

1273
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:34,317
would be expecting me,
so there.

1274
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:37,862
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
I know why you're here,

1275
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:39,906
-so, uh... so there.
-(button beeps)

1276
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:42,742
(chuckles) You do?

1277
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:45,036
-Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.
-(button beeps)

1278
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,746
-(whirring)
-Have a seat, please.

1279
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,164
(grunts) Thank you.

1280
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:49,874
-You know what you are?
-Mm?

1281
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:54,254
You are, if I may,
extremely intelligent.

1282
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,755
Go on. (grunts)

1283
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,382
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I've been observing you.

(button beeps)

1285
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:00,510
Spends time wisely. Check.

1286
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:03,179
Makes good use of
classroom materials. Check.

1287
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:05,765
Keeps hands to self. Check.

1288
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,308
Hey, forget
"works well with others."

1289
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,437
You make others
work well for you.

1290
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:13,857
That's literally the title
of the book I'm working on.

1291
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,109
No kidding.
You had no business

1292
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,236
being in Yellow Level, did you?

1293
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,613
-It was sabotage.
-Sabotage. Exactly.

1294
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:23,199
Jealousy, fear. Hey, I faced
the same obstacles.

1295
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:26,828
In fact, you know,
you remind me a lot of myself

1296
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,289
when I was your age,

1297
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,125
which is now.

1298
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,585
(grunts)

1299
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:36,629
What?

1300
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:37,964
(laughs)

1301
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:41,301
Surprise, surprise.

1302
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,803
What the frittata?

1303
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:44,929
Well put.

1304
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,390
He's a ba... You're a baby.

1305
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,976
I repeat, you're a baby.

1306
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,479
So surprised,
you said it twice. (chuckles)

1307
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,980
(laughs)

1308
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:57,484
Unfortunately, people are, uh,
not ready for a...

1309
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:59,736
a baby in a position of power.

1310
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:01,279
Yet.

1311
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,990
Remind me to get the number
of your muttonchop guy.

1312
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,826
You know, I could use
somebody like you.

1313
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:10,789
With a superior intelligence
like my own.

1314
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,500
-Uh... really?
-Mmm.

1315
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:14,918
Somebody who can, uh...

1316
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:17,087
Mmm. (crunching)

1317
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,505
-Mmm. Yeah.
-(gasps)

1318
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:21,257
Truly comprehend
what I'm trying to accomplish.

1319
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,010
-Well, you're looking at him.
-Bingo.

1320
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,221
Mmm. We have a secret level.

1321
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:27,889
Mmm.
For very special babies.

1322
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,391
Mmm. The best of the best.

1323
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:30,642
Ah. The elite.

1324
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:31,685
Beyond blue?

1325
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,728
Oh, yeah. Way beyond.

1326
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,730
Way beyond. Ooh.

1327
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,857
Mmm. There's a meeting today...

1328
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:39,609
(slurps)
...after school.

1329
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,152
Babies only.

1330
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:44,030
We may be small, but we're
about to teach grown-ups

1331
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,408
a big lesson.

1332
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,703
Mmm. Lolly?

1333
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,037
-Okay.
-(school bell ringing)

1334
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,580
Oh. Time for recess.

1335
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,082
-Bye-bye.

(grunts)

1339
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,466
Well, I think that went well.

00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,386
-TED (recorded): You're a baby.
-TINA: What?

1341
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,430
-I repeat, you're a baby.
-(scoffs)

1342
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,640
Is he talking to me?
He better not be talking to me,

1343
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,142
because I'll... Armstrong?

1344
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:13,893
(chuckles)
You're right, Connie.

1345
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,437
He's talking about Armstrong.

1346
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,230
-I don't know what has
gotten into her. -(gasps)

1347
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:20,900
-But she's acting strange,
Dr. Federman. -(laughing)

1348
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:23,153
Isn't it a bit early
for terrible twos?

1349
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:25,030
Is there terrible ones?
Is that a thing?

1350
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:26,573
Oh, piano-playing bunny,
you slay me.

1351
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,158
Okey dokey.

1352
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:32,495
We need some eyes on the prize,
visual confirmation here.

1354

Oh, Daddy.

1355
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:38,126
If I were there,
I'd pinch you so hard.

Sail away! What time is it?

1359

AUTOMATED VOICE:
It is time for recess.

1360

I'm late, I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late. Come on.

He'll understand, right?

1362
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:51,348
(gasps) Okay.
Where is he? Where is he?

1363
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:54,726
-Where is he? Uh...
-(kids chattering, whooping)

1364

-Oomph! Yeah, baby!
-(cheering)

1365
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,271
No, not my bows.

-But they're not your bows...
anymore. -(sobbing)

Where do you think
youse going? You lost?

1374
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:23,797
Could you let me through,
please?

1375
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,256
No!

1376
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:27,967
So, what, did you flunk
coloring class, kid?

-(laughter)
-Really, guy?

1378
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,305
Mmm, cherry.

1379
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:33,306

See? I'm cool.

I'm cool.

1385
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,648
You failed me, Tim.

1386
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,108
I was desperate.

1387
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:45,819
I crawled.
I did things with glue

1388
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,238
that I'm not proud of,
but I made it.

1389
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,198
I made it all the way
to Armstrong's office,

1390
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,200
and then where's Tim?

1391
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:53,410
-I know. I...
-Where's Tim?

The Box.

1398

Show a little respect.

1399
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,256
See, Tim, this is why
I work alone.

1400

-(sighs)
-I'll succeed in the mission.

1401

You can take the pony home.

The only thing
you're ever gonna succeed at

1403
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:13,805
is being alone.

1404

NATHAN: Ugh! You always
come in a beat late.

1414
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,786
I'm sorry, Nathan.
I'm doing my best.

1415
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:40,707
Your best is going to keep me
out of going to Juilliard.

1416
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,667
-Yeah, Templeton.
-It's one, two, three

Are you kidding me?

1422
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:55,722
I just can't do it
right now, okay?

1423
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:57,182
I can't. I just can't.

1424

See you at the pageant
tomorrow.

1428
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,859
Beat it!

1429

Nathan, let me do it.

No.

00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,907
Product testing?

1510
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:06,996
Huh. Something tells me
this isn't day care.

1511
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:10,917
Boy, could I use
a spy camera right about now.

1512
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:14,462
* Sail away, sail away,
sail away. *

1513
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:17,007
Anyway...

1514
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,094
-(gasps)

1515

TED:
Aw.

1516
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:25,765
Now, aren't you a cutie
in that little karate outfit.

1517
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,100
(baby grunts)

1518
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:28,351
Huh.

1519
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:30,520
(all whooping, grunting)

1520
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:33,273
Is this some kind
of a ninja boy band?

1521
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:34,482
(screams)

1522
00:54:34,524 --> 00:54:37,110
-Whoa...!
-(babies whooping)

1523
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:39,112
Whoa!

1524
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,947
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1525
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:42,866
(all grunting, whooping)

1526
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:45,118
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!

1527

(screams)

1528
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,620
Whoa. (yells)

1529
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:48,621
I give up.

1530
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:52,375
Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai!

1531
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:55,420
(all grunting rapidly)

1532

Sayonara, baby!

1533
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,341
-Hey, there you are.
-Oh, hello! (coughs)

1534
00:54:59,382 --> 00:55:00,675
Thank you. (sighs)

1535
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:02,469
I see that you've angered
my baby ninjas.

1536
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,887
-Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
-(baby laughs, grunts)

1537
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:05,638
-Shoo. Shoo. (chuckles)
-(sneezes, babbles)

1538
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,849
What maniacal underground
fortress doesn't have ninjas?

1539
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,476
-Am I right? (grunts)
-Impressive, huh?

1540
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:10,810
Pretty impressive.

1541
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:12,312
What do you think?
What do you think?

1542
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:13,438
TED:
I know tuition is pretty steep,

1543
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,565
but how do you afford all this?

1544
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,525
ARMSTRONG:
Oh, that's a good question.

1545
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:20,111
-I taught babies to code.
-No.

1546
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:22,113
ARMSTRONG: Yes. And you know
what they say about having

1547
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:24,324
an infinite amount of monkeys
banging on typewriters?

1548
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,201
They will eventually
write Shakespeare?

1549
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,370
A-plus.
Oh, boy, you are smart.

1550
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:32,290
Or the most popular apps
that money can buy.

1551
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:34,376
Apps. They're writing apps.

1552
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,002
-Cat Chat.
-(cat meows)

1553
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,337
Palm Doodle.

1554
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,005
Ooh, Find My Nose.

1555
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:40,423
-(Ted gasps)
-Stock Crush.

1556
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:42,008
-You did Stock Crush?
-(cash register dings)

1557
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,677
I love Stock Crush.

1558
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:46,596
All us. But my next app...

1559
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:49,349
ooh, it's gonna change
the world.

1560
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:50,433
Forever.

1561
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,768
So why bother with a school?

1562
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,312
You could go public
and make millions.

1563
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,064
Oh. (laughs)

1564
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,441
-Billions.
-Billions.

1565
00:55:58,483 --> 00:56:01,528
Yeah, but some things are
more important than money.

1566
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:03,196
Please don't say "love."

1567
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:05,407
Mmm. Power.

1568
00:56:05,448 --> 00:56:07,617
That's more like it.

1569
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,453
TIM:
Wow. This is so amazing.

1570
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,206
First, the ride, and now
a-a full sit-down dinner.

1571
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:14,916
Wow. What a palace.

1572
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,335
-I mean, you have electricity?
-Well, yeah.

1573
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,504
Man, you guys
are beyond generous.

1574
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:21,548
You're welcome anytime.

1575
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:23,174
-(groans)
-CAROL: Tabitha, would you mind

1576
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:24,843
-setting the table?
-Okay, Mom.

1577
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:27,095
Really? You're just gonna
throw that right there, huh?

1578
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:28,263
(gasps)

1579
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:30,890
Psst. Psst. Daddy.

1580
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:32,767
-Shh! It's Marcos.
-What are you doing here?

1581
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:34,352
-Where's Uncle Ted?
-What?

1582
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:35,395
He kicked me off the mission.

1583
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:36,354
He can't do that.

1584
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,397
Only I can do that.

1585
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:38,606
You're back on the mission.

1586
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:40,066
No need.
I have my own mission now.

1587
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,360
What? What could be more
important than my mission?

1588
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,571
Got to go. Lightspeed out.

1589
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,240
This is so great.
(chuckles)

1590
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:48,825
Well, I hope you're hungry.

1591
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,535
Been so long since I've
used silverware. (chuckles)

1592
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:53,038
So, how'd you like
your first day?

1593
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,414
Kind of intense.

1594
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:56,416
(chuckles):
Yeah. You'll get used to it.

1595
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,959
-Even that Nathan kid?
-Nathan.

1596
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,211
-Ugh. He's a mess.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

1597
00:57:00,253 --> 00:57:02,422
-He is such a square.
-A square?

1598
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,424
Uh, yeah, you know,
like a dork.

1599
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,343
Dweeb. Nerdlet.
A real poindexter.

1600
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:07,886
Lame-o. Dorkus to the max.

1601
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:09,721
(chuckles)
They used to call me.

1602
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,223
-(chuckles) You're weird.
-I am?

1603
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:14,267
Yeah, but in a good way.

1604
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:15,769
(both chuckle)

1605
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,355
So, why is the pageant
stressing you out so much?

1606
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:20,482
(groans)
I have to sing.

1607
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:22,692
-So what?
-I don't know.

1608
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:25,070
My whole family is
going to be there,

1609
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:27,238
including my dad.

1610
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,782
Oh.

1611
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:30,200
Right.

1612
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:32,285
You're embarrassed of him?

1613
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:34,371
No. No, it's not that.

1614
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:35,914
(Tim sighs heavily)

1615
00:57:35,955 --> 00:57:37,707
It's just, he's really good
at this kind of thing--

1616
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:41,503
being creative
and using your imagination--

1617
00:57:41,544 --> 00:57:43,546
but it's hard for me.

1618
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:45,799
I just want him
to be proud of me.

1619
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,133
You know?

1620
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:49,135
(coos)

1621
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:50,136
Really?

1622
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:52,847
Well, yeah.

1623
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:55,975
Um, who are
these extra plates for?

1624
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:57,811
-(doorbell rings)
-(whispers): Mom and Dad.

1625
00:57:57,852 --> 00:57:59,729
Hey, hey!
The key still works!

1626
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:01,272
You guys should really
change the locks.

1627
00:58:01,314 --> 00:58:02,857
-Oh, you made it.
-Look who's here!

1628
00:58:02,899 --> 00:58:03,650
Mom and Dad.

1629
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:04,818
TABITHA:
Grandma! Grandpa!

1630
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:06,611
-TED SR.: There she is.
-(gasps)

1631
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,113
-Come here, my little
tabby cat. -Yay! You're here!

1632
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:10,198
-Look at how big you are.
-You're almost a teenager.

1633
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,616
Can you vote yet?

1634
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:12,867
TABITHA: Ten and a half
more years, Grandma.

1635
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:14,119
Daddy, they're gonna
recognize you.

1636
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,286
No, no. It's fine.

1637
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:17,205
I've got the glasses. See?

1638
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:18,665
-TED SR. and TABITHA: Selfie!
-How do you do it again?

1639
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:19,958
Bring out the baby.

1640
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,543
-Hide!
-Where are you hiding that baby?

1641
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:22,961
No. Just be cool. Be cool.

1642
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,504
-JANICE: There she is.
-TED SR.: Hello.

1643
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:25,755
TED SR.:
Hey, who's the new guy?

1644
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,674
-That's Marcos.
-I gotcha.

1645
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:30,927
(babies clamoring)

1646
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:33,263
Attention, babies. <i>Bienvenue.</i>

1647
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:35,015
<i>Willkommen.</i>

1648
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:36,391
<i>Dobro pozhalovat'.</i>

1649
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,144
-And namaste.
-(clamoring continues)

1650
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,104
Uh, babies.

1651
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:42,439
Hey, hey.

1652
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,898
-No more screen time.
-(clamoring stops)

1653
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,276
-(whimpering)
-ARMSTRONG: Listen.

1654
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:49,571
Believe it or not,
I used to be just like you.

1655
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:52,198
-(cooing)
-Yes. I even had parents.

1656
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,618
Mine were child psychologists

1657
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,121
who made me part
of an experiment.

1658
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,372
Really?

1659
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:02,042
They exposed me to 10,000 hours

1660
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:05,628
-of Mozart, language lessons
and public radio. -Huh. Wow.

1661
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,422
I hate public radio.

1662
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:10,967
It was at that point I realized
I was smarter than my parents.

1663
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,971
And with my first step,
I ran away from home.

1664
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,223
-(babies moan sadly)
-Why?

1665
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:19,059
They pushed me around.

1666
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,227
I got told what to do
all the time.

1667
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:22,395
(crying)

1668
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:25,440
But a single word
changed my life.

1669
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:27,067
"No." Say it.

1670
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:28,401
ALL:
No!

1671
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,403
-Take a nap.
-Nyet!

1672
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:32,322
-Put on your coat.
<i>-Nein!</i>

1673
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:34,699
-Eat your vegetables.
<i>-Nahii!</i>

1674
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,993
Are you gonna let grown-ups
push you around?

1675
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:39,371
No, no! No, no, no!
No, no! No, no, no!

1676
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:40,747
-Are you?
-Good God, no.

1677
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,082
That's right.

1678
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:45,085
Why do parents get to be
in charge, anyway?

1679
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:47,504
They had their chance,
and what did we get?

1680
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:51,675
Pollution, politics, wars.

1681
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:54,052
BABIES:
Ooh.

1682
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,096
Not "ooh." "Boo."

1683
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:57,722
ALL:
Boo!

1684
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:01,101
The only thing holding us back
is them,

1685
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:02,769
but not anymore.

1686
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,690
The moment that we've worked
so hard for is almost here.

1687
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:07,857
-B-Day.
-(babies cheering)

1688
01:00:07,899 --> 01:00:09,109
-B-Day?
-B-Day.

1689
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,236
-I'm this many.
-I'm this many.

1690
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,613
No, no, it's not...
it's not your birthday.

1691
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:16,491
It's the beginning
of the baby revolution.

1692
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,326
-Yay, yay.
-(babies cheering)

1693
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:20,995
And there'll be cake.
Cake for everybody.

1694
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:23,790
BABIES (chanting): Cake! Cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

1695
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,417
-No more rules.
-(chanting continues)

1696
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,293
<i>Oh là là!</i>

1697
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:29,045
No more parents.

1698
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,296
Uh-oh.

1699
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,464
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

1700
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,967
Sayonara, Mama and Papa!

1701
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,011
-Oh, this is bad.
-(chuckles)

1702
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,929
All right, pep rally's over.

1703
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,348
Your-your parents
are gonna pick you up.

1704
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:41,433
(crying)

1705
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:42,976
This is my life's work.

1706
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,937
Oh, yes, 17 long months.

1707
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,565
To... no more parents.
(laughs)

1708
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:50,233
Mmm. (gargles, slurps)

1709
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,694
Cheers to the revolution.

1710
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:55,363
-No. Nope. Nope.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1711
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,240
-No. Oh, that's a keeper.
-TABITHA: Oh, Tina.

1712
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:59,367
Oh, it's so cute.
What's the app called?

1713
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,827
-It's called QT Snap.
-Oh.

1714
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,787
-Show me how to download that.
-Everyone has it.

1715
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,831
So, Marcos... Lightspeed?

1716
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:06,458
-Is that what you said?
-Mm-hmm.

1717
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:08,293
Sounds like a cartoon name.

1718
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:09,502
(laughing)

1719
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,338
-It really does.
-(laughs awkwardly)

1720
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:14,299
Well, my parents,
they're a little wacky, so...

1721
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,925
(slurping)

1722
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:18,678
Huh. It's like I know you
from somewhere.

1723
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,055
I don't think so.

1724
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:21,723
-That is a keeper, too.
-Hey. Hey.

1725
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,767
-Doesn't he look familiar?
-I don't think I do.

1726
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,226
Yeah, he looks just like Tim.

1727
01:01:25,268 --> 01:01:26,853
Yeah. You look like Tim.

1728
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,064
-(coughs)
-Hmm? -Huh?

1729
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,607
Except Tim didn't wear glasses.

1730
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,776
Oh, that's right.
(scoffs)

1731
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:35,278
Huh. Well, how about that.

1732
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,864
-(Tina sighs)
-Hey, where is Tim, anyway?

1733
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,699
Tim and Ted are on a trip.

1734
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,910
-TED SR. and JANICE: Together?
-They're bonding.

1735
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,995
-Well, that's about time.
-Yeah.

1736
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,206
I just hope Tim's back
in time for the pageant.

1737
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:47,707
-(Janice scoffs)
-(Ted Sr. chuckles)

1738
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,669
Uh, why...
why wouldn't he be there?

1739
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,712
-(laughs) Tim Time.
-Tim Time.

1740
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:53,755
-JANICE: Oh. (chuckles)
-(Carol laughs)

1741
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,881
What's-what's Tim Time?

1742
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,383
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1743
01:01:56,424 --> 01:02:00,345
Well, Marcos, Tim Time
is like a black hole

1744
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:04,808
where things like reality
and being on time get lost.

1745
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:06,267
-(Tabitha laughs)
-Oh.

1746
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,062
Tabitha's father has
a very active imagination.

1747
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,814
Which is a good thing.

1748
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:12,524
Yeah, that's a...
I'd say that's a good thing.

1749
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,902
Oh, remember when he said our
boss was trying to kidnap us?

1750
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,445
-He did?
-(laughter)

1751
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:20,031
TED SR.: Or that his baby
brother could walk and talk

1752
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,700
but only when
we weren't looking.

1753
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:23,034
(laughter)

1754
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:24,953
<i>("William Tell</i>Overture"
playing)

1755
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,831
(chuckling):
Wow. Turn around.

1756
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,042
TABITHA:
That's so Dad.

1757
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,753
You know, Ted was
quite a handful himself.

1758
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:36,089
-Oh, he could be very...
-TED SR.: Uptight.

1759
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,882
JANICE:
Mm. Yes. High-strung.

1760
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:40,301
Oh. Remember the time
he sued us?

1761
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:43,054
-(laughter)
-JANICE: Teenagers. Ugh.

1762
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,306
He really looked up
to his big brother, though.

1763
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:47,475
-BOTH: He did?
-JANICE: Oh, yeah.

1764
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:49,310
He wouldn't leave him alone.

1765
01:02:49,352 --> 01:02:50,937
Everything Tim did,
Teddy wanted to do.

1766
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:52,480
-TABITHA: Really?
-Yeah.

1767
01:02:52,522 --> 01:02:54,607
-Tagalong Teddy, we called him.
-(Tabitha chuckles)

1768
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:56,776
-JANICE: Well, not to his face.
-TED SR.: No, no.

1769
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,029
Not to his face.
He was very litigious.

1770
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,281
But you know what?
Your dad didn't mind.

1771
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:03,324
He was so proud
of his little brother.

1772
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:05,160
-Oh, yeah.
-He loved showing him off.

1773
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,871
TED SR.: Those guys did
everything together.

1774
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:09,956
JANICE:
They were best friends.

1775
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,708
-Just like you and me.
-(Tina giggling)

1776
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,460
Right, Tina?

1777
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,794
Best friends forever.

1778
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:16,129
-Tickle monster!
-(Carol chuckles)

1779
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,298
CAROL:
That's so sweet.

1780
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,474
TABITHA:
And this is my closet.

1781
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,309
-TIM: Oh, cool closet.
-And this is my bed.

1782
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,269
-And this is my fish.
-(tapping)

1783
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:35,023
-Hey, want to see something
really, really cool? -Sure.

1784
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,984
I made this vocalizer
for Dr. Hawking.

1785
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,778
Hey, my old...

1786
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:41,738
-What did you do?!
-Check this out.

1787
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,907
Say hello, Dr. Hawking.

1788
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,826
ROBOTIC VOICE:
Hell-l-l-l-l...

1789
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:50,497
(grunts)
Um, he has performance anxiety.

1790
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:51,915
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1791
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:53,583
Oh, this is Lamb Lamb.

1792
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,126
Hey, Lamb Lamb.

1793
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:57,837
That's my galaxy model
right up there on my shelf.

1794
01:03:57,879 --> 01:04:00,048
My scientist of the week award.

1795
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,925
-Wow.
-My geode rock collection.

1796
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,510
And my telescope.

1797
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:04,678
Sweet.

1798
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,013
-Hey, cool guitar.
-Yeah.

1799
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,056
That's my dad's.

1800
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:09,933
Cool dad. (grunts)

1801
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:11,226
Are you okay?

1802
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,520
Yeah, I'm a lot taller
in my mind.

1803
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,731
Hey, if you want,
I can help you with your song.

1804
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,025
No, you can't.

1805
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,694
-Your ears will bleed.
-Oh, please.

1806
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,362
It'll be fun.

1807
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,948
How about this one?
It's a classic.

1808
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:27,033
(sighs)
Do we have to?

1809
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:29,369
Come on. Let's try.

1810
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,122
Okay.

1811
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:34,749
It's not gonna be good, though.

1812
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:35,917
No judgment.

1813
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,460
We're just having fun.

1814
01:04:37,502 --> 01:04:39,587
(playing gentle melody)

1815
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:46,469

* There's no place like home *

1816
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:48,638
* For the holidays *

1817
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,598
ROBOTIC VOICE:
Please stop.

1818
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,227
-No, stop. Aah...!

Good... try.

Ugh! I just get so nervous.

That's okay.

1824
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:07,240
Listen, all you got to do

1825
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:10,243
is imagine that
you're inside the song.

1826
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:14,080
Everything in the lyrics
is actually happening to you.

1827
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:17,250
And you can see the notes.

Wow. That was so great.

No, you were so great.

1882
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:32,844
Thanks, Marcos.

Guys, come on.

Stop. No, do it. Do it.

Oh, no.

Parents, right? (chuckles)

I got a tooth growing in.

Back in my day, we wrote memos.

No.

Let's get to the nut,
the nugget.

1917
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:40,537
What are you afraid of?

1918
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:42,997
Sharks, getting shot
in the head with an arrow,

1919
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:44,416
and... the IRS.

-That's it.
-There you go.

Was that so hard?
Baby steps.

1922
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,462
Now, what about being lonely?

1923

-I'm not lonely.
-Mm-hmm.

I'm just... alone.

There's a difference.

you read your file. -(gasps)

We were just kids.

We didn't know anything
about the real world.

1943
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,638
And eventually,
you have to grow up.

1944
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,891
Just because you grow up,
it doesn't mean

1945
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:44,434
you have to grow apart.

1946
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:47,103
I don't know.
Maybe it's already too late.

01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,904
Uncle Ted really misses you.

1954
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:03,870
So, hey, uh, what you doing?

01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:05,330
Oh, I was, uh...

1956
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:08,583
I don't know,
I was just working on this.

1958
01:10:12,837 --> 01:10:15,632
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said at recess.

1959
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,259
What happens on the playground
stays on the playground.

1960
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,178
I was just worried
about Tabitha, you know?

1961
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,554
She's your daughter. I get it.

1962
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:23,264
This whole time,
I was thinking about

1963
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:25,642
what I wanted
and not what she needed.

1964
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:27,811
I think I finally got this
parenting thing figured out.

1965
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:28,978
Gold star for you, Daddy.

-Keep it up, Pops.
-Yeah, well, about that.

1967
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:33,775
Armstrong wants to get rid
of parents somehow.

1968
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:36,111
-Sorry, what? -He's planning
a baby revolution.

1969
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:37,654
Ugh, come on.

1970
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,906
Just when I got good
at this whole parenting thing.

1971
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,408
We got to stop him.

1972

-Not we.
-You?

1973
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:44,369
Neither one of us.

1974
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,037
-BabyCorp is taking it
from here. -Ah.

1975
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,206
So, what, they're gonna send in
the Baby SEALS or something?

1976
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:49,749
-Looks like it.
-So you'll, um...

1977
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:52,127
you'll be headed back
to your office.

1978
01:10:52,168 --> 01:10:54,421
TED: Uh, yeah.
Well, keep in touch, Tim.

1979
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:56,256
Hello? BabyCorp?

1980
01:10:56,297 --> 01:10:58,258
Thank goodness, BabyCorp.
Well, BabyCo...

1981
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:00,510
(stammering):
Wha-What? What are you saying,

1982
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:02,512
there's not enough evidence,
BabyCorp? I...

1983
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:04,347
-Uh-oh. -So you're not
gonna do anything?

1984
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:05,765
But, BabyCorp, I...

1985
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:07,475
Ugh. Well, then
we'll take care of it.

1986
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,269
You know what, BabyCorp?

1987
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,687
I quit!

1988
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,814
What a bunch of
diaper sniffers. (grunts)

1989
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:14,566
(whistle blows,
train powers down)

1990
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,776
Looks like we have to stop
Armstrong ourselves.

1991
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:19,362
We're going rogue.
I like it.

1992
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,031
-So the mission's back on?
-Yeah.

1993
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:23,825
If you two can put up with
each other a little longer.

1994
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:27,120
I suppose I can live with that.
Tim?

1995
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:28,121
I think that's doable.

1996
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:29,122
Yay!

1997
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,582
Forced together again.

1998
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:33,376
WIZZIE:
It's 8:45 p.m.

1999
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:35,462
TED:
Okay. Our clock is ticking.

2000
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:38,590
We have to stop Armstrong
before the formula wears off.

2001
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:42,010
Working as a team,
we will strike at the pageant.

2002
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:43,303
Go, Tina.

2003
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,638
Now, this top secret
document...

2004
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,140
Sweetie, it's the program.

2005
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,476
This top secret program reveals

2006
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:52,479
that Armstrong is scheduled
to address the audience,

2007
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,565
which he will do right here
at the very end.

2008
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:58,193
We need someone backstage.
Tim, that's you.

2009
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,862
How am I gonna get backstage
if I'm not in the pageant?

2010
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,739
TED: My people will
take care of that.

2011
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:03,573
(toy squeaks)

2012
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:04,991
-Ah!
-Thank you.

2013
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,159
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

2014
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:07,243
-No!
-Great.

2015
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:09,329
-And... go.
-(laughing)

2016
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:10,789
Glue.

2017
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,665
(screams)

2018
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:15,001
ROBOT VOICE:
There, there. All better.

2019
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,628
Awesome.

2020
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,090
Now, I'll be your eyes
and your ears in the audience.

2021
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:22,008
I can't let Mommy see me talk,

2022
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,927
or she's gonna start
squealing and hugging me,

2023
01:12:23,968 --> 01:12:25,679
but these little doodads
will let you

2024
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,514
understand my baby talk.

2025
01:12:27,555 --> 01:12:29,182
It's called a GAGA device.

2026
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,558
-Aw, that's cute.
-Check it out.

2027
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,851
(speaks gibberish)

2028
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,103
(over GAGA):
Can you hear me, Daddy?

2029
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:34,354
Also cute.

2030
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:36,439
Meanwhile,
with my new purple status,

2031
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:38,483
<i>I can stay close to Armstrong.</i>

2032
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,527
Um, that's-that's an eyebrow.

2033
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:42,529
-Oh. Sorry.
-Uh, no, that's, uh...

2034
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,280
TED:
<i>When the moment is right,</i>

2035
01:12:44,322 --> 01:12:45,907
<i>I'll implant a device.</i>

2036
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,409
-Got it.
-Got what?

2037
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,618
I mean, you've got this.

2038
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,662
Go get 'em, tiger.
(chuckles)

2039
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:52,622
-Oh, thank you, parents.
-(applause)

2040
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:54,040
Thank you. There's the...

2041
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:56,042
There's the old enthusiasm
I like to see.

2042
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:58,420
TINA: <i>This will</i>
<i>allow me to control his suit.</i>

2043
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:01,881
<i>I can make Muttonchops</i>
<i>do whatever I want.</i>

2044
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:03,758
(babbling)

2045
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,177
TINA:
<i>I can make him dance.</i>

2046
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:07,887
<i>I can make him prance.</i>

2047
01:13:07,929 --> 01:13:09,723
-Hey, no, no, no, no.
<i>-Including exposing himself</i>

2048
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:11,558
<i>-to the audience.</i>
-(audience gasps)

2049
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:14,352
-(screams) <i>-Every parent</i>
<i>will pull out their phone.</i>

2050
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,730
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

2051
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:19,357
The photos will spread
like a diaper rash.

2052
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,234
Cut to our pizza party.

2053
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:23,194
Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof!

2054
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,404
Questions?

2055
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:25,613
After Tabitha sings
her solo, right?

2056
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:27,115
After Tabitha sings.

2057
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:30,785
Now we just sit back, relax
and enjoy the show.

2058
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:33,580
(fanfare playing)

2059
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:36,082
ARMSTRONG: Welcome, parents,
to our holiday pageant.

2060
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:39,586
Remember, flash photography
in the auditorium

2061
01:13:39,627 --> 01:13:42,255
is absolutely okay.

2062
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:45,050
Take a picture. Show your kids
that you love 'em.

2063
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:46,593
Yippee!

2064
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:47,969
Come on, Tim.

2065
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:50,263
-You promised you'd be here.
-(man groans)

2066
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:51,765
Oh, sorry. This seat is taken.

2067
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:53,725
-Yep. Sorry.
-Oh, no. (mutters)

2068
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,977
-So sorry. I... Sorry.
-(man grunts, mutters)

2069
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,104
-Sorry! I am so sorry.
-(speaking gibberish)

2070
01:13:58,146 --> 01:14:00,440
(over GAGA): Uncle Teddy,
are you in position?

2071
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:01,816
The baby's in the cradle.

2072
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:04,486
-The baby's in the cradle.
-Mmm. (slurping)

2073
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,112
(speaking gibberish)

2074
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,114
(over GAGA):
Papa Bear, can you read me?

2075
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:09,741
The flake has landed.

2076
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:11,826
Places! Places, everybody!

2077
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:13,203
-Here we go. Here we go.
-Oh, my gosh.

2078
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:15,121
-It's starting. It's starting.
-(sighs) Finally.

2079
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:16,706
It's starting. It's starting.

2080
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:17,999
Yay!

2081
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,126
-You're a big pageant guy, huh?
-No, no, no.

2082
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:22,671
I'm not talking about the show.
I'm talking about B-Day.

2083
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:24,881
B-Day?

2084
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:27,258
Oh, yeah. It's already
in the parents' phones.

2085
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,010
(coughs)

2086
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:30,804
I taught babies to code.

2087
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:33,515
TED:
Apps. They're writing apps.

2088
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:35,725
But my next app...

2089
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:39,312
ooh, it's gonna change
the world forever.

2090
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:43,983
QT Snap is the app that's going
to change the world forever?

2091
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:46,986
Forever starts today.
(chuckles)

2092
01:14:47,028 --> 01:14:49,030
Uh, cool. (gasps)

2093
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,449

-KIDS: * It's wintertime *

2098
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:00,750

01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:06,673
* The snow has disappeared *

2102

* Doomed. *

2105
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:14,347
This is kind of dark.

2106
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:15,682
Did the kids just say
we're doomed?

2107
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,684
What the heck are we watching?

2108
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:19,769
-(camera clicks)
-(yelps)

2109
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,521
Their brains are
turning to mush.

2110
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:23,064
Months of hypnotic research
embedded

2111
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:25,900
in the most user-friendly
photo app ever made.

2112
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:27,527
Ooh.

2113
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:29,612
Now all we need to do
is sit back, relax

2114
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:31,364
and enjoy the show.

2115

2120
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,041

Las Posadas!

-Agnostic!

-And Hanukkah!
-(screams)

2126
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:53,928
Your son is so talented.

-Oh, so is yours.
-Liars.

B-Day is happening now.

2129
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,268
It's all in the phones.

2130
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,271
Armstrong is using an app
to brainwash the parents.

2131
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:05,315
-(gasps)
-(over GAGA): Gasp.

-(speaking gibberish)

2133
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,152
(over GAGA):
Okay, okay. Uh, there's a...

2134
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:11,696
there's a big old
no-touchy switch backstage.

2135
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:13,073
(speaking gibberish)

2136
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:14,741
(over GAGA): Daddy,
we have to pull the plug.

2137
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:16,993
Daddy, come in.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

2138
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:18,411
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

2139
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,372
Ugh. He's not responding.

2140
01:16:20,413 --> 01:16:21,706
(panting):
Of course not.

2141
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,875
-I'll do it myself.
-Stop!

2142
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:26,753
-(grunts)
-Theater kids only.

2143
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:29,089
Oh, come on, nativity!

2144
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,465
Look holier!

2145
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:31,925
(angelic choir vocalizing)

2146
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:33,510
(gasps)

2147
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:35,929
TIM:
Hey, Tabitha.

2148
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,847
(chuckling):
Don't you worry, okay?

2149
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:39,766
You're gonna be great.

2150
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,060
Thanks, Marcos.
And thanks for all your help.

2151
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:43,186
Anytime.

2152
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:45,271
I feel like you really
understand me.

2153
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:46,940
I'm so excited.

2154
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:50,735
I can't wait to see the look
on my dad's face when I sing.

2155
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,613
MEGHAN:
Hey! You're on, Templeton!

2156
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:54,948
Wish me luck.

2157
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:56,366
MEGHAN:
And break a leg.

2158
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:57,909
Or two, for that matter.
(laughs)

2159

* We live in harmony... *

2161
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:05,375
TED:
Psst.

2162
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:07,460
Tim!

2163
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:08,712
Is that the baby Jesus?

2164
01:17:08,753 --> 01:17:10,005

* We have to shut down
the pageant. *

2169
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:19,723
-Yeah!
-What? No. Why?

2170
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:22,142
Armstrong's turning
the parents into zombies

2171
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:23,852
so they'll do
whatever he wants.

2172
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:25,979
What? What are you doing? No!

Tabitha's on next.

TED: You'd risk
the future of the world

01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:32,819
-to see your daughter sing?
-Yes!

2177
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:34,904
-I have to be there for her.
-Look who's worried about

2178
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:36,531
showing up for things
all of a sudden.

2179
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,158
What's that supposed to mean?

2180
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:39,826
You didn't even come
to my graduation.

2181
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,286
Ow! Which one?

2182
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:43,747
Business school, law school.
None of them.

2183
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:45,498
You didn't even come
to my wedding.

2184
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,250
-Which one?
-I only had one!

2185
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,918
We had a deal, Tim.

2186
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,837
You promised
you'd be there always.

2187
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,422
Whoa. Where did you...

2188
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:55,050
-Breach of contract!
-(grunts)

2189

(ninja babies whooping)

2190
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:58,845
Whoa.

2191
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,180
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

2192
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,599
ARMSTRONG:
How do you do there, fellas?

2193
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,560
(chuckles)
Nothing's gonna ruin my B-Day.

2194
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:08,146
Not even you.

2195
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:10,023
-Oh, busted.
-Yeah, it was obvious

2196
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,649
from the very, very beginning

2197
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:14,319
that you two were
working together.

2198
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,737
What gave us away?

2199
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:18,031
Well, I'd say the bickering,

2200
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,866
the, uh, petty disputes,

2201
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,534
the jealousy.

2202
01:18:21,576 --> 01:18:24,704
You know, you two are brothers
in every single way.

2203
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:26,414
(hums a tune)

2204
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:28,708
-Off to the Box they go.
-(ninja babies yelling)

2205
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,752
What? No.
Not the Box. Not now.

2206
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:32,379
Please.

2207
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,381
Aw, it's just... it's too bad
that you're never gonna

2208
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:36,549
have a chance to reboot
your relationship and...

2209
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:38,510
-No!
-...and restore the closeness

2210
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:39,886
that you once felt.

2211
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,554
-Sorry about that.
-No.

2212
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:43,807
-No, no, no, no. No!
-Adios, Marcos.

2213
01:18:43,848 --> 01:18:46,893

CAROL:
Oh, look, look. There she is.

2215
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:49,938
There's our little angel.

-Oh! Tabby's in the tree.
-Ah! Oh!

(yells)

2221
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,786
You had one job to do.

2222
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:06,788
One job.

2223
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,790
-Oh, no.
-The fountain.

2224
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:10,458
It's flooding the room.

2225
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,835
This isn't a time-out.

2226
01:19:11,876 --> 01:19:13,253
It's game over.

2227
01:19:13,294 --> 01:19:15,338

2228
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,674

MEGHAN:
Psst.

01:19:24,472 --> 01:19:28,059
It's one, two, three
and one, two, three.

* Catch my eye *

2234
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,118
* Take my hand *

2235
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:50,457
* This bond is tighter
than we ever planned *

2236
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:52,834
* Give me courage *

2237
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:55,295
* So I can land *

2238
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:58,840
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2239
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:02,927
* So together we stand *

2240
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:06,848
* Laugh and cry with me *

2241
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,517

-* The world looks so good
through our eyes * -Wow.

01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:19,361
* Like the moon
and stars at night *

2245
01:20:20,987 --> 01:20:23,031
You're right. I blew it.

2246
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:25,158
I ruined the mission.
(sighs)

2247
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,077
And I'm a terrible father.

2248
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:30,080
Hey, you did sort of
ruin the mission.

2249
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:31,706
But you're a great dad.

2250
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:33,166
No, I'm not.

2251
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,793
I could never do your job.

2252
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:36,378
I mean, you work
around the clock,

2253
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:38,088
you can't even quit
if you wanted to,

2254
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:39,714
and you don't even get paid.

2255
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:42,092
Frankly, I don't see
how that's legal.

2256
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,260
I was always jealous of you.

2257
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:46,721
I wanted to be successful,
too, you know.

2258
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,056
Sure, Tim.

2259
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:50,433
I made a lot of money...

2260
01:20:50,475 --> 01:20:52,560
but you made a family.

2261
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:55,689
The truth is...

2262
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,649
it's lonely at the top.

2263
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:03,697
* Reach with me *

2264
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:07,033
* See the sky *

2265
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:11,788
* I'll always be here
for the rest of your life *

2266
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,791
* Sail that ocean *

2267
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,210
* Find that sand *

2268
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:20,797
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2269
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:24,843
* So together we stand *

(kids vocalizing)

2271
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:34,185
You know, I'm... I'm sorry we
don't see each other anymore.

2272
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:36,229
A very wise person
once told me,

2273
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:38,064
just because you grow up

2274
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:40,066
doesn't mean
you have to grow apart.

2275
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,609
-Was it Tina?
-Oh, yeah.

2276
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:44,571
(laughing): Oh, it is crazy
how smart she is.

2277
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:46,823
It's like she looks
right into your soul.

2278
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:49,743
I'm sorry that I missed
your graduations.

2279
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:52,454
I'm sorry I missed
your one wedding.

2280
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:55,749
BOTH: I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

2281
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:58,668
* Side by side *

2282
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,338
* Hand in hand *

2283
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:06,217
* We speak a language
no one else can understand *

2284
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:09,179
-* Hear those cheers *
-(cameras clicking)

2285
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,473
* Strike up the band *

2286
01:22:11,514 --> 01:22:15,977
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2287
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:23,193
* So together we stand. *

2288
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:27,030
(chuckles)

2289
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:29,115
(panting)

2290
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:34,746
(pants, whimpers)

2291
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:37,165
(one person clapping)

2292
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,503
(hyperventilating)

2293
01:22:41,544 --> 01:22:43,797
(crying)

2294
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:45,840
Oh, Tabitha.

2295
01:22:45,882 --> 01:22:47,300
(gasps) Gramps?

2296
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,010
Nana? Mom?

2297
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:50,178
Oh, no!

2298
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,097
-(grunts)
-Oh, my gosh, Tabitha.

2299
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:53,973
You did such a great job.

2300
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:57,227
Well, that's just
horribly rude of you all.

2301
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,561
Come on, everybody.

2302
01:22:58,603 --> 01:23:02,440
Uh, how about
a standing ovation?

2303
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:05,402
-(laughs) Very good.
-(Tina gasps)

2304
01:23:05,443 --> 01:23:07,028
They're zombies!

2305
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,738
We did it!

2306
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:12,659
-The baby revolution has begun.
-(babies cheering, laughing)

2307
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,994
No more need for costumes.

2308
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:16,913
(yells, laughs)

2309
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:19,124
Who wants cake?

2310
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:21,501
Oh, my gosh.

2311
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,087
ARMSTRONG:
Happy B-Day, everybody.

2312
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:26,131
Daddy, Uncle Ted.

2313
01:23:26,172 --> 01:23:27,716
Come in. Where are you?

2314
01:23:27,757 --> 01:23:30,051
(crying)

2315
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:33,680

2317
01:23:36,057 --> 01:23:38,059
(sniffles)

2318
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:40,061
TINA:
Here you go, sis.

2319
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:42,605
Now, I already used this,
so I know it's safe.

2320
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:44,399
Thanks.

2321
01:23:45,775 --> 01:23:48,319
Wait. Are you t-talking?

2322
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:50,321
(chuckling): I know.
It's pretty weird, isn't it?

2323
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:52,574
(screams)
Oh, my gosh, you're talking!

2324
01:23:52,615 --> 01:23:54,034
It's an emergency.

2325
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:56,369
I'm on a supersecret mission
from BabyCorp.

2326
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:57,370
(gasps)

2327
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,789
You mean Dad's stories
are true?

2328
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,708
That's what the suit says.

2329
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,917
How do I look?

2330
01:24:02,959 --> 01:24:04,336
No way!

2331
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:06,379
Now, I can't get ahold
of Dad or Uncle Ted,

2332
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,298
so I need your help, big sis.

2333
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,924
Wait, wait.
Dad's here?

2334
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:11,426
They've been here
the whole time.

2335
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:13,386
-Where? -I don't have
much time to explain,

2336
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:15,764
but Dr. Armstrong is a baby.

2337
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,724
A very bad, bad baby.

2338
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:21,603
Soon, the world is
gonna be our playground.

2339
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:24,064
-Whee! (grunts) -("Push It"
by Salt-N-Pepa playing)

2340
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:25,440
(laughs)

2341
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,817
Now we can make parents
do whatever we want.

2342
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:29,944
Awesome! Yeah!

2343
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:32,906
No more rules.

2344
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:35,617
Sayonara, Mama and Papa.

2345
01:24:35,658 --> 01:24:36,951
Yeah.

2346
01:24:36,993 --> 01:24:38,078
(babies laughing)

2347
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:39,412
-Mom?
-Dad?

2348
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:40,413
Grandpa?

2349
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:42,123
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

2350
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:44,250
We need to shut it down
before it goes global.

2351
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,419
-ARMSTRONG: Yeah. (laughs)
-What are we gonna do?

2352
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:48,672
Okay, we need to find
the big whatchamacallit

2353
01:24:48,713 --> 01:24:50,298
that controls
the parents' phones.

2354
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,841
-The server.
-Yes. Yes.

2355
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:54,010
Is there a big one
of those whatsits at school?

2356
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:55,595
Uh, let's see.

2357
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:58,765
Well, servers get really hot,
so you need air ducts.

2358
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:00,100
TINA:
Now you're thinking!

2359
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:02,310
TABITHA:
Which intersect at the acorn!

2360
01:25:02,352 --> 01:25:04,646
-A-plus!
-Come on.

2361
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:06,106
-This way.
-(gasps)

2362
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:08,358
Opportunity knocks.

2363
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,944
First, we need to make
a quick pit stop.

2364
01:25:10,985 --> 01:25:14,280
AUTOMATED VOICE (distorted):
Your time has concluded.

2365

-(both panting)
-It looks like this is it, Tim.

2366
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:18,785
Well, hey, at least we have

2367
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:22,455
these last final
precious moments together.

2368
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:25,875
Precious. Precious!

2369
01:25:25,917 --> 01:25:28,336

That's my girl.

2381
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,165
Thank you.

2382
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:07,167
(sputters, spits)

2383
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,418
(gasps) Tina?

2384
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,836
Tina, Tina, come in.
It's Daddy.

2385
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:12,213
Daddy! Listen, we have
to shut down the server.

2386
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:14,007
-It's in the acorn.
-Whoa.

2387
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:15,675
This is so weird.

2388
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:16,968
I call shotgun.

2389
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,053
Quick, to the acorn!

BOTH:
Yeehaw!

2392
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:24,184
Hold on to your chaps, pal.

2393
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:25,268
-(ninja baby shouts)
-Whoa!

2394
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,562

2395
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:32,901
-(screams)
-Oh, no!

2396
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:36,029
Glue! (laughs)

2397
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:38,531
Yah! Pixie dust! Aha.

2398
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:39,949
-Yeah, baby. -Yes.

Wha...?

2404
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,419
CREEPY GIRL:
Where'd I go?

2405
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:54,547
-Whoa!
-I like your pajamas.

2406

(ninja babies crying)

2408
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,428
Where are you going?

2409
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,888
-Hyah!
-(whooping)

2410
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,765
-Glue.
-TED: I'm proud to be a yellow.

2411
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:05,058
I like your pony.

(both scream)

2413
01:27:06,142 --> 01:27:07,394
Thank you.

-(crying)
-ARMSTRONG (over radio): What?

2415
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:12,315
Ah, ah, ah. No, no, no.

2416
01:27:14,025 --> 01:27:16,111
(whirring)

2417
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:19,364
Now let's crack that big nut.
(grunts)

2418
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,534
Oh, no.
It's about to go worldwide.

2419
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:24,786
How are we gonna get up there?

2420
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,497
-Really?
-ARMSTRONG: Well, you got grit.

2421
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,124
I'll give you that.

2422
01:27:29,165 --> 01:27:31,167
Gumption, even. Very admirable.

2423
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:33,336
And yet, uh, annoying.

2424
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:35,588
Quite annoying. Yeah.

2425
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:38,174
I'm gonna have to,
you know, uh, stop you.

2426
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:39,426
Glue me, glue me, glue me.

2427
01:27:39,467 --> 01:27:40,969
Precious, sic him.

2428
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:42,303
You're too little and too late.

2429
01:27:42,345 --> 01:27:44,431
-(clang)
-Ah, ba-bad dog.

2430
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,767
-Pets aren't allowed in school.
-Aah! Precious!

2431
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:50,937
And you, my pudgy protégé.

2432
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:52,272
Go, go, go, go! Move! Move!

2433
01:27:52,313 --> 01:27:54,274
-I offered you the world.
-(both yell)

2434
01:27:54,315 --> 01:27:55,734
-We could have been partners.
-(groaning)

2435
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:57,610
I've got something better
than a partner.

2436
01:27:57,652 --> 01:27:59,696
-I have a brother.
-Yeah!

2437
01:27:59,738 --> 01:28:01,906
-(grunts) Let go.
-No, you let go.

2438
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:04,117
Wow. Point taken.

2439
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,827
What? What's going on?

2440
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:09,205
(yelling)

2441
01:28:09,247 --> 01:28:10,457
Hey, that's my leisure suit.

2442
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:11,875
It looks better on her.

2443
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:13,376
Hands up, diapers down.

2444
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:14,794
Things are about to get weird.

2445
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:16,504
-Yeah, that's my girls!
-(Ted laughs)

2446
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:18,465
-That's really Dad?
-Yep.

2447
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:20,675
I said a lot of stuff
to that kid.

2448
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,469
Well, quite the family reunion.

2449
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,928
Uh, the more the merrier.

2450
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,097
-I say let's call your parents.
-TIM: Oh, no.

2451
01:28:26,139 --> 01:28:27,474
(zombielike murmuring)

2452
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:29,309
-Uh-oh.
-Okay.

2453
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:31,644
Mommy and Daddy,
let's hug 'em-- to death.

2454
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:33,563
Oh, don't worry about us.
Get to the server.

2455
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,482
-Go, Tina, go!
-(whoops)

2456
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,526
-(Armstrong stammering)
-(Tina grunts, yells)

2457
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:40,362
-Hey!
-You got this, Tina.

2458
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:41,738
Get down from there.

2459
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,490
TED:
Go for his lollies!

2460
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:45,825
Never touch another man's pony.

2461
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:46,910
(all grunt)

2462
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,287
Here. Stick around.
Stick around.

2463
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:51,706
Uh, Tim, what do we do now?!

2464
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,667
Don't move.
Maybe they won't see us.

2465
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,335
TED:
They see us, Tim. They see us.

2466
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,711
TIM:
Did you move? I didn't move.

2467
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:58,171
-TED: Really, Tim?
-(grunting)

2468
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,006
Oh. Hey, that's a little
too high now.

2469
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:02,842
Don't look down.
Look straight ahead, okay?

2470
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:04,719
(grunts, whimpers)

2471
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,388
-(buzzer sounds)
-It's locked.

2472
01:29:06,429 --> 01:29:08,181
Can I give you a hand?

2473
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:09,474
Of course,
I mean that facetiously,

2474
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:12,185
because the hand acts as a...
as a key.

2475
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,520
No, no. No, no, no.

2476
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:15,230
-Hey, hey. No, no, no, no.
-Thanks, sis.

2477
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:17,524

Stay away from my server.

2479
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,527
-Shut it down, Tabitha.
-What are you doing?

2480
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:22,445
What are you doing?
No, no, no! No!

2481
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,197
Don't do that.

2482
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,573
-Oh, no!
-(zombielike grunting)

2483
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:27,200
-Hugs.
-Hug Grandpa.

2484
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,785
It's <i>Night of</i>

(groans) Back.
Back, you little monsters.

2489
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:38,962
-You back off, candy pants.
-(yells, grunts)

Ha! Got your nose.

-Ah, poopy.

Tina, I think I got it. Yes!

2499

Don't hit that button.
Don't hit that button. Aah!

01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:02,068
Ow! Ooh!

01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,779

-(gasps) The fire alarm.

-ARMSTRONG: Darn it.
-TABITHA: Dad!

2505

Uncle Ted!
Pull the fire alarm!

2506
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,415
-The girls need help.
-TED: No kissies!

2507
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:17,709
The girls need us. (grunts)

-(grunts) Time's up, halflings.

2509
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:23,590

Great galloping gargoyles!

-(Ted screaming)
-WIZZIE: What? What?

2511
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:29,346
Tim! Get to the fire alarm!

2512
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:30,805
I'll hold them back.

2513

TED:
Make it rain, baby.

2514

TIM:
I'm on it.

2515
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:35,894
What's the matter?

2516
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:37,479
(voice cracks): You can't
handle the awkward phase?

2517
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,605
(whimpering)

2518
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:40,982
Go, Marcos... uh, Dad. Go!

-I'm back!

-Here we go.
-Come on.

2521
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,112
How about another round,
you tough guy? Come on!

2522
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:47,530
Ow. Stop it.

2523
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:48,948
I still got these.
(grunting)

2524
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,617
TABITHA:
You put my sister down.

2525
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:53,828
B-Day will happen,
whether you like it or not.

2526
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:56,122
-You shall not pass!
-(zombielike murmuring)

2527
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:58,041
Uh, you shall not pass.

2528
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,751
No! Stop passing.

2529

-(grunts)
-(fire alarm ringing)

2530
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:02,712
Yeah, Dad!

2531
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,172
Way to go! (whoops)

2532

-(alarm stops)
-(Tabitha gasps)

2533
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:07,884
TABITHA:
That's it?

2534
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:10,178
That's right. Why? What?
The school's expensive.

2535
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,306
-I had to cut costs someplace.
-(both grunt)

2536
01:31:13,348 --> 01:31:14,474
Oh, no. It's not working.

2537
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:15,642
Did you pull it right?

2538
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:16,976
How else you gonna pull it?

2539
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:19,020
ARMSTRONG (laughs):
You'll see I'm right.

2540
01:31:19,062 --> 01:31:20,647
I'll show everybody.

2541
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:23,817
The age of parents is over.

(babies cooing, murmuring)

2543

ARMSTRONG:
Yay, yay, yay. (sighs)

2544
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,827
How about you watch me
have a little toast?

2545
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:37,122
To the baby revolution
and to me.

2547

candy volcano... -Mmm, mmm.

-Oh, that's good.
-TABITHA and TINA: Of doom!

2549
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:46,506
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

2550
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:48,008
No, no, no! No!

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

-No, no, no.
-Boom shakalaka?

2553
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,847
-Boom!
-Don't do that!

Look at you.

2567
01:32:20,373 --> 01:32:22,208
You're smart. You're strong.

2568
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,543
You don't need parents.

2569
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,587
What can they possibly
offer you?

2570
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:28,048
-How about unconditional love?
-(gasps, yells)

2571
01:32:28,089 --> 01:32:29,799

2580
01:32:45,648 --> 01:32:47,942
I got you. I got you.

I got you.

That's my big brother.

2586
01:32:59,954 --> 01:33:02,957
Thanks, Marcos Lightspeed.

2587
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:06,628
Mwah.

2588
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:09,464
I thought we both
had to grow up.

2589
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,925
Well, let's not
grow up too fast.

2591

I love you, Tabitha Templeton.

2593
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:18,973
Aw. You see that?

2594
01:33:19,015 --> 01:33:21,267
And you wanted
to take it all away.

2595
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:22,769
-Where you going?
-Home.

2596
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:25,647
You know, Doc,
childhood doesn't last forever,

2597
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:27,524
but family sure does.

2598
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:29,275
Uncle Ted! Heads up!

-Woo-hoo!

it was never business.
