00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,927
也许我们很快就能见到你。
Maybe we'll see you soon.

148
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,933
晚安,大比大。
Good night, Tabitha.

149
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,937
你不觉得我现在太老了吗?
Don't you think I'm a little old for that now?

150
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,606
呃,好吧。
Uh, okay.

151
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,151
我觉得我们都该长大了。
I think it's time we both grow up.

152
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,529
我期待着在早餐桌上和你打招呼。
I look forward to greeting you at the breakfast table.

153
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,829
甜蜜的梦想。
Sweet dreams.

154
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,723
嗯。
Hmm.

155
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,100
♪♪
♪ ♪

156
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,442
时间都到哪里去了?
Where has the time gone?

157
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,903
我怎么知道?
How should I know?

158
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:28,697
等待,等待。我看到光明。
Wait, wait. I see light.

159
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,658
你，给我让开。
You, oh, out of my way.

160
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,786
终于。
At long last.

161
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:36,497
自由的气息。
The sweet breath of freedom.

162
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:37,749
Wizzie吗?
Wizzie?

163
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,459
你呢，这是哪个世纪?
You there, what century is this?

164
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,795
放开我，邪恶的食人魔!
Unhand me, vile ogre!

165
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,379
不，不，不。Wizzie,是我。
No, no, no, no. Wizzie, it's me.

166
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,923
这是蒂姆。
It's Tim.

167
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,882
真的是你吗?
Is it really you?

168
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,550
更接近。
Come closer.

169
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,512
让我看看你的脸。
Let me see your face.

170
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,305
近了。
Closer.

171
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,391
更近。
Closer still.

172
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,225
哦,盖。
Oh, Timothy.

173
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,476
这是你。
It is you.

174
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,187
嘿!这是为什么?
Hey! What was that for?

175
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,398
你把我丢进了永恒的黑暗
You cast me into eternal darkness

176
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,317
破坏了我的昼夜节律。
and wreaked havoc on my circadian rhythms.

177
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,651
对不起,Wizzie。
I'm sorry, Wizzie.

178
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,319
嘿，不过你看起来很棒。
Hey, but you look great, though.

179
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,531
你是说除了手臂。
Except for the arm, you mean.

180
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,824
我都没注意到。
I didn't even notice.

181
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,242
-你认为它。-我是说，我注意到了
-You thought it. -I mean, I noticed it,

182
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,867
因为我……你显然没有胳膊。我…
'cause I... you obviously don't have an arm. I-I...

183
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,786
你绝不会这样对待小羊羔的。
You would never treat Lamb Lamb this way.

184
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,581
好吧,我……我把她给了我女儿，塔比瑟。
Well, I... I gave her to my daughter, Tabitha.

185
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,375
你有继承人了吗，提摩太?
You have produced an heir, Timothy?

186
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,709
实际上,两个。
Two, actually.

187
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,252
两个?让钟声敲响吧!
Two? Let the bells ring!

188
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,297
-不,不,不。Wizzie,停下来。-是的!是的!
-No, no, no. Wizzie, stop. -Yes! Yes!

189
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,173
-Wizzie,嘘!安静,安静。-这是庆祝的时刻!
-Wizzie, shh! Quiet, quiet. -It's a time for celebration!

190
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,175
不,不,不。现在不是庆祝的时候。
No, no, no. It's not the time for celebration.

191
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,886
-Wizzie,嘘。保持安静。-什么?它是什么?
-Wizzie, shh. Be quiet. -What? What is it?

192
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,804
-怎么了，蒂姆?我不知道。
-What is it, Tim? -I don't know.

193
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,639
我想我只是没有感觉
I guess I'm just not feeling

194
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,767
现在非常值得庆祝。
very celebratory right now.

195
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,686
哦?
Oh?

196
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,520
塔比瑟。
Tabitha.

197
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:45,692
天啊，巫师，她长得真快。
Man, Wizzie, she's growing up so fast.

198
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,735
她好像已经不需要我了。
It's like she doesn't even need me anymore.

199
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,322
是的，首先，他们开始减少和你在一起的时间。
Yes, first, they start spending less time with you.

200
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,782
毫米。
Mm.

201
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,993
然后他们就不再向你寻求建议了。
Then they stop coming to you for advice.

202
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,994
完全正确。
Exactly.

203
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,120
很快，他们就会把你视为理所当然。
Soon, they take you for granted.

204
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,538
我猜。
I guess.

205
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,499
-那就打断你的胳膊。-什么?
-Then break your arm. -What?

206
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,083
然后把你塞进盒子里!
Then stuff you into a box!

207
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,044
好吧。Wizzie,你……你没有帮助。
Okay. Wizzie, you're... you're not helping.

208
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,714
好吧,我只是……我害怕
Okay, I'm just... I'm afraid

209
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,798
塔比瑟和我越来越疏远了
Tabitha and I are growing apart,

210
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,885
喜欢……就像我对我弟弟那样
like... like I did with my brother.

211
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,596
哦。
Oh.

212
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,682
我以为我们有的是时间。
I thought we had all the time in the world.

213
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,393
但你不能让时光倒流，对吧?
But you can't turn back time, can you?

214
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,020
你竟敢质疑我的力量!
How dare you question my power!

215
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,441
词背。回头。-又来了。
-Turn back. Turn back. -Oh, here we go.

216
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,068
-哦，大车轮的李…等。
-Oh, great wheel of li... -Wait.

217
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,903
你听到了吗?
Did you hear that?

218
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,907
不要滥用贪睡按钮!
Never abuse the snooze button!

219
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,991
听起来像是从婴儿房传来的。
It sounds like it's coming from the baby's room.

220
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,994
它是什么?一个黑夜的生物?
What is it? A creature of the night?

221
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,081
女巫吗?这是地狱之犬的叫声吗?
Witches? Is it the baying of the hounds of hell?

222
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,414
Wizzie !
Wizzie!

223
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,582
不去,蒂姆!
Don't go, Tim!

224
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,168
我可以让时光倒流……
I can turn back time...

225
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,754
敬那黄金岁月，那时只有你和我。
To the golden years, when it was just you and me.

226
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,423
我的好。
My good arm.

227
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,174
不要开门。
Don't open the door.

228
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,094
记得最后一次!
Remember last time!

229
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,807
如果你想打个电话，
If you would like to make a call,

230
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,308
请挂断再试一次。
please hang up and try again.

231
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,480
如果你需要帮助，请挂机，然后拨总机。
If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator.

232
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,273
谢谢你！
Thank you.

233
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,441
喂?
Hello?

234
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,025
如果你想打个电话，
If you would like to make a call,

235
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,696
请挂断再试一次。——啊。只是我的电话。
-please hang up and try again. -Ah. Just my phone.

236
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,822
振作起来，伙计。
Get it together, man.

237
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,158
蒂娜，你这个小小偷…
Oh, Tina, you little klepto...

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,244
晚安。
Nighty night.

239
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,452
…疯子!
...maniac!

240
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,124
哇!
Whoa!

241
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,875
嗨,爸爸。
Hi, Daddy.

242
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,961
T-Tabitha吗?是你吗?
T-Tabitha? Is that you?

243
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,674
你真该看看自己的表情。
You should've seen your face.

244
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,552
哦,这是无价的。
Oh, it's priceless.

245
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:37,052
你……你……你,你……
You're... You... You-you...

246
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,974
你可以说话吗?
You-you can talk?

247
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,143
是的。我在做家族生意。
Yep. I'm in the family business.

248
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,812
这是夹上去的领带。
It's a clip-on tie.

249
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,105
你看，爸爸，宝宝公司更像是我…
You see, Daddy, BabyCorp is more of what I...

250
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,774
哦。
Oops.

251
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,152
爸爸，爸爸，进来。你能听到我说话吗?
Daddy, Daddy, come in. Can you hear me?

252
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:53,778
爸爸，你听得到我吗?
Daddy, do you read me?

253
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,488
爸爸，我举起了几根手指?
Daddy, how many fingers am I holding up?

254
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,697
星期四吗?
Thursday?

255
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,990
我应该警告你的。
I should've given you a warning.

256
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,533
我忘了你是个老人了。
I forgot you were an old man.

257
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,037
等待,等待。
Wait, wait.

258
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,913
从BabyCorp -你是吗?-是的。
-You're from BabyCorp? -Yes.

259
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,914
宝宝公司更像我说的
BabyCorp is more of what I call

260
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,750
-我的副业。-嗯。
-a side hustle for me. -Uh-huh.

261
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,836
重点是坦普尔顿家的事我全押上了。
The point is I'm all in on the Templetons.

262
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,337
——去,邓普顿!-哦!好吧。
-Go, Templetons! -Oh! Okay.

263
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,173
你们真会照顾孩子。
You guys really know how to baby a baby.

264
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,758
-我是说，这太不可思议了。-哦,哦。
-I mean, it's incredible. -Oh, oh.

265
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,342
不是的，都是五星级的。
Not that's it's all five-star.

266
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,345
-我不得不说，你有很多问题。-当然。是的。
-I have to say, you got a lot of issues. -Sure. Yeah.

267
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,553
我们稍后会讨论这个。
We'll talk about that later.

268
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,971
哦,我的天啊。我真不敢相信。
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe this.

269
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,140
想去把妈妈吓个半死吗?
Hey, want to go scare the crap out of Mom?

270
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,100
-爸爸，请集中精神。-哦。
-Daddy, please stay focused. -Oh.

271
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,644
对,对,对。
Right, right, right.

272
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,355
婴儿公司出现了危机。
There's a crisis at BabyCorp.

273
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,480
这次又怎么了?
What is it this time?

274
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,523
小猫?
Kittens?

275
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,649
不。这一次，情况更糟。
No. This time, it's even worse.

276
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,902
比小猫无稽之谈?-是的。
-Worse than kittens? -Yes.

277
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,695
所以我才自愿参加
That's why I volunteered for

278
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,572
这绝密的任务。妈妈。
-this supersecret assignment. -Mommy.

279
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,490
哦，我想帮忙。你想让我怎么做?
Ooh, I want to help. What-what do you want me to do?

280
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,033
这就对了，爸爸。
That's the spirit, Daddy.

281
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,870
-你正是我需要的人。-是的!
-You are exactly who I need. -Yes!

282
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,663
去找泰德叔叔。
To get Uncle Ted.

283
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,374
不。什么?
No. What?

284
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,875
你的脸怎么了?
What-What's with the face?

285
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,378
爸爸，宝宝公司不能再等了。
Daddy, BabyCorp can't wait any longer.

286
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:52,671
所有的压力都在我身上，爸。
All the pressure's on me, Pop.

287
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,880
当我自愿参加这项工作时，
When I volunteered for this gig,

288
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,799
我以为会很容易。
I thought it would be easy.

289
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,384
但你们俩从来没见过面。
But you two never see each other.

290
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,969
它是如此悲伤。
It's so sad.

291
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,179
这就像,”负。课后见我。”
It's like, "F-minus. See me after class."

292
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,724
悲伤?嗯,是的,也许。
Sad? Uh, yeah, maybe.

293
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,933
一点。我不知道。
A little. I don't know.

294
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,351
你忘记给他打电话了吗?
Did you forget to call him?

295
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,269
我注意到你有时有点心不在焉。
I noticed you can be a little absentminded.

296
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,647
对不起,什么?
Sorry, what?

297
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,399
只是你有拖延症。
It's just that you tend to procrastinate.

298
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,567
你得让他来这里过节。-
You have to get him here for the holidays. -

299
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,860
不,我不是……
No, I'm not...

300
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,278
不，我现在不会给他打电话。
No, I'm not gonna call him right now.

301
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,738
-爸爸，不能，永远不能。-不。-
-Daddy, can't never could. -No. -

302
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,115
你们俩吵架了还是怎么了?
Did you two have a fight or something?

303
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:21,908
-不。-但你生他的气了?
-No. -But you're mad at him?

304
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,201
阻止这种情况的发生。它是复杂的。
Stop that. It's complicated.

305
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,328
为什么?需要我帮你使用手机吗?-
Why? Do you need help using your phone? -

306
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,081
不，我不需要用我的…-
No, I don't need help using my... -

307
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,624
好吧。有什么问题吗?…
Okay. What's the problem?...

308
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,125
这个问题是什么?跟我说话。
What's the issue? Talk to me.

309
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,876
没有意义，好吗?
There's no point, okay?

310
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,921
我打电话给他。我邀请他。他从未出现过。
I call him. I invite him. He never shows up.

311
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,923
他总是要参加工作会议或出差
He's always got a work meeting or a business trip

312
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,591
或者是电话会议。
or a conference call.

313
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,467
他只关心工作。
All he cares about is work.

314
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,431
但过了一段时间，你…你只是停止尝试。
But after a while, you... you just stop trying.

315
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,640
他还是你哥哥。
He's still your brother.

316
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,934
你是合作伙伴。
You were partners.

317
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,687
是的，我想有时候你只是…-
Yeah, I guess sometimes you just... -

318
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,816
你长大了，又长大了。
you grow up and grow apart.

319
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,571
爸爸，不要说不。
Daddy, don't say no.

320
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:00,989
如果每个人都说不呢?
What if everybody said no?

321
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,157
没有什么会发生。
Nothing would happen.

322
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,575
没有任何东西能够起飞。
Nothing would get off the ground.

323
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,908
你每天都要醒来
You got to wake up every day

324
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,702
你得说"好，好，好"
and you got to say, "Yes, yes, yes!"

325
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,123
让我吃惊。说是的。
Surprise me. Say yes.

326
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,793
这真令人失望。
This is really disappointing.

327
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,087
-现在我很生气!——晚了。
-And now I'm getting mad! -It's late.

328
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,173
我们明天再解决，好吗?
We can work on this tomorrow, okay?

329
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:23,802
哦。Whoopsie。你的小马掉下来了。
Oh. Whoopsie. Your little horsey fell off.

330
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,347
再多一天也不会有坏处，对吧?
Another day won't hurt, right?

331
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,850
晚安,亲爱的。
Good night, sweetie.

332

你是说那个语音信箱是某种求助电话。
So you're saying the voice mail was some kind of call for help.

她来自一个由婴儿经营的秘密公司。
She comes from a secret corporation run by babies.

蒂姆，我会告诉你一个医生的名字。
Tim, I'm gonna give you the name of a doctor.

Roy Federman. Just tell him I sent you, okay?

What are they saying?

00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,734
我们应该给他们点私人空间。
We should give them some privacy.

397

在这儿你走。-哦。谢谢。

你只是不记得了。告诉他,蒂娜。
You just don't remember. Tell him, Tina.

停止打断。
Stop interrupting.

402
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,493
中断是什么?我什么都没听到。
Interrupting what? I don't hear anything.

除了你那讨厌的声音。你听到这个消息。
Except your obnoxious voice. You hear that.

Suck it, Ted.

-Get that pacie out of my face! -Excuse me.

417
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,684
我不愿意打断你们，但我可以提个建议吗?
I hate to interrupt, but may I make a suggestion?

418
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,061
你们俩怎么不去死?
Why don't you both suck it?

419
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,022
哈!
Ha!

是我单枪匹马拯救了公司。
Well, I did single-handedly save the company.

Double-handedly。
Double-handedly.

Really?

我没看到你的雕像。
I don't see your statue.

我仍然爱你，爸爸。
I still love you, Daddy.

They got the head size right.

Take it from me, you have to be aggressive

00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,217
如果你想取得成功。
if you want to get ahead.

444
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,926
爬上公司的阶梯
Climb that corporate ladder

445
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,596
直到你成为站在山顶上的最后一个孩子。——哇。
until you're the last baby standing at the top. - Wow.

446
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,557
事实上，我优先考虑良好的工作和生活平衡
Actually, I prioritize a good work-life balance

447
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,103
还有一个积极的环境，让我的想法得到重视。
and a positive environment where my ideas are valued.

448
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,647
哦,你是认真的。
Oh, you're serious.

449
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,525
你真有趣，泰德叔叔。
You're funny, Uncle Ted.

450
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,777
我想知道为什么他们没有在你的档案里提到这一点。
I wonder why they didn't mention that in your file.

451
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,944
我的文件吗?
My file?

452
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,488
你看到我的档案了吗?
You saw my file?

453
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,780
是的。-上面说什么了?
-Yep. -What does it say?

454
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,115
它说明了很多。
It says a lot.

455
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,535
-这里是危机中心。-啊。哇。
-This is the Crisis Center. -Whoa. Wow.

456
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,037
这里是我们监视所有威胁的地方
This is where we monitor all threats

457
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
献给全世界的婴儿。
to babies around the world.

458
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,332
和夏威夷。
And Hawaii.

459
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,125
这太酷了。这太酷了。
This is so cool. This is so cool.

460
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,127
我是哥斯拉。
I'm Godzilla.

461
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,671
“啊，快逃命去吧!”快逃命吧!”
"Oh, run for your lives! Run for your lives!"

462
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,048
-我们为什么带他来?-爸爸，快下来。
-Why did we bring him? -Daddy, get down from there.

463
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,800
哦。-我们可以等没人看的时候再玩。
-Aw. -We can play on it later when no one is looking.

464
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,510
什么是危机?-是的。
-What's the crisis? -Yeah.

465
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,137
我们开始吧。什么危机，亲爱的?
Here we go. What's the crisis, sweetie?

466
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,556
生锈的,滚。
Rusty, roll it.

467
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,476
他的新。
He's new.

468
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:07,313
想象一下，小外科医生。
Just imagine, baby surgeons.

469
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,648
哦。
Uh-oh.

470
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,984
或婴儿宇航员。
Or baby astronauts.

471
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,154
吃水浅的、能浮起的浮动。
Floaty, floaty, float.

472
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,490
是的，总有一天婴儿会统治世界。
Yes, babies are gonna run the world one day.

473
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,744
这一天来得比你想象的要早。
And that day is coming sooner than you think.

474
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,748
你好。我是欧文·阿姆斯特朗博士
Hello. My name is Dr. Erwin Armstrong,

475
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,334
橡子高级儿童中心的创始人。
founder of The Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood.

476
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,294
等一下，那是…大比大的学校。
Wait a minute, that's... that's Tabitha's school.

477
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,671
在这个中心，我们相信婴儿
Here at the center, we believe babies

478
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,298
是终极学习机器。
are the ultimate learning machines.

479
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,259
对吧，小内森?
Isn't that right, little Nathan?

480
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,427
-耶!-好的。
-Yeah! -Okay.

481
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,012
他们应该利用宝贵的时间
They should use their precious time

482
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,473
37、要发展得更快，努力得更猛。
to develop faster, push harder.

483
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,892
——嗯。父母，他们拥有最好的
- Hmm. - -Parents, they have the best

484
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,853
当然是意图，但他们不是专家。
intentions, of course, but they're not experts.

485
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,981
毕竟，唯一阻碍孩子成长的是……
After all, the only thing holding your child back is...

486
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,776
-你。-你!
-you. -You!

487
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,487
这就解释了为什么塔比瑟一直远离我。
This explains why Tabitha's been pulling away from me.

488
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,404
——学校。每个人,波。
-It's the school. -Everybody, wave.

489
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,990
再见,妈妈。再见,妈妈!
-Bye, Mommy. -Bye, Mommy!

490
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,240
再见,爸爸。再见,爸爸!
-Bye, Daddy. -Bye, Daddy!

491
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,868
再会。
Sayonara.

492
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,953
在过去的六个月里
Now, in the past six months,

493
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,957
这些学校如雨后春笋般在世界各地出现。
these schools have been popping up all over the world.

494
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,209
呃，有什么问题吗?
Uh, so what's the problem?

495
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,876
学校才是问题所在。
The school is the problem.

496
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,336
是的。学校都是恶的。
Yeah. School is evil.

497
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,547
不，爸爸，不是所有的学校都是邪恶的。
No, Daddy, not all schools are evil.

498
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,674
-就这一个，好吗?-好的。
-It's just this one, okay? -Okay.

499
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,801
如果阿姆斯特朗的哲学继续传播，
If Armstrong's philosophy keeps spreading,

500
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,970
这可能是童年的终结。
it could be the end of childhood.

501
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,430
不。
No.

502
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,766
童年是我一生中最糟糕的三年。
Childhood was the worst three years of my life.

503
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,351
这是如此悲伤。
That's so sad.

504
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,228
你可能只是做得不对。
You probably just didn't do it right.

505
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,520
嗯?哦。
-Huh? -Aw.

506
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,772
但幸运的是，你可以重来一次。
But luckily, you get a do-over.

507
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,982
第二次机会。
A second chance.

508
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,654
婴儿公司开发了一种新的超级婴儿配方奶粉
BabyCorp has developed a new super-duper baby formula

509
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,574
能让大人变回婴儿的。-
that can turn a grown-up back into a baby. -

510
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,910
我们有樱桃汁、葡萄汁、橙汁和酸橙汁。
We have it in cherry, grape, orange and lime.

511
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,703
——真的吗?-等等，等等，等等。
-For real? -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

512
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,663
-你想让我变成婴儿?-嘿，这是你最擅长的。
-You want me to be a baby? -Hey, it's what you do best.

513
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,790
这样你就能潜入学校找出答案
So you can infiltrate the school and find out

514
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,501
阿姆斯特朗博士到底想干什么
what Dr. Armstrong is really up to.

515
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,087
剩下的就交给BabyCorp了。
BabyCorp will take care of the rest.

516
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,593
这是完美的伪装。
It's the perfect disguise.

517
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,555
而且只持续了48个小时。
And it only lasts 48 teensy-weensy hours.

518
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,347
我也参与了这次任务。
Oh, I am in on the mission.

519
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,516
对不起,持久性有机污染物。…噢。
-Sorry, Pops. -Ow.

520
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,393
-这不是你的任务。哦。
-It's not your mission. -Aw.

521
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,436
警告:可能导致流口水，胡言乱语，
"Warning: may cause drooling, babbling,

522
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,271
情绪爆发，大笑，
"emotional outbursts, fits of laughter,

523
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,276
失禁排便，大腿胖乎乎的"?
loss of bowel control, chubby thighs"?

524
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,112
我想我健身房里的人会吃这个。
I think some guys at my gym take this stuff.

525
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,031
我的手发短信!
My texting hand!

526
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,366
即使那是你女儿的学校。-
Even though it is your daughter's school. -

527
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,868
看起来不公平，对吧?
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

528
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,369
爸爸,没有。请停止。
Daddy, no. Please stop.

529
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,788
哇!
Whoa!

530
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,416
什么?它真的有用。
What? It actually works.

531
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,461
它是我的!
It's mine!

532
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,297
-我更擅长做这种事!-哦!
-I'm better with this kind of thing! -Oh!

533
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,134
那是什么东西，海鸥群吗?
And what kind of thing is that, Flock of Seagulls?

534
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,806
资料!明白了!
-Everything! -Gotcha!

535
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,642
你可能会很情绪化，有一些情绪波动。
You might feel very emotional, have some mood swings.

536
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,186
哦!
Oh!

537
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,730
嘿!
Hey!

538
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,023
哎哟。这是一个尴尬的阶段。
Ouch. There's the awkward stage.

539
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,650
现在茶已经热了，康妮。
Now, the tea's hot, Connie.

540
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,652
你总是想当英雄，不是吗?
You always have to be the hero, don't you?

541
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,570
这是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

542
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,823
从来没见过他…
Never see him...

543
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,825
突然，他带着一匹小马出现了。
All of a sudden, he shows up with a pony.

544
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,078
你只是嫉妒，头盔头。
You're just jealous, helmet head.

545
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,497
她是我的女儿!
She's my daughter!

546
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,164
她是我的侄女。
She's my niece.

547
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,166
你要加奶油或糖吗?
Do you want cream or sugar?

548
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,711
我总是成功的那个。
I was always the successful one.

549
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,339
妈妈说不许在家里乱跑。
Mommy says no running in the house.

550
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,590
毫米。
Mm.

551
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,843
把瓶子给我，鲻鱼。
Hand over the bottle, mullet.

552
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,013
你不能拥抱钱，你知道的。
You can't hug money, you know.

553
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,144
但你可以的，蒂姆。你可以。
But you can, Tim. You can.

554
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,067
男人。我说的对吗?
Men. Am I right?

555
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,952
这不是个人。
It's not personal.

556
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,788
它的业务,莱斯利。
It's business, Leslie.

557
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,915
这是我的私事，琳赛。
Well, it's personal to me, Lindsey.

558
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,882
停，停，停，停，停!喔,喔,喔!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Ow, ow, ow!

559
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,759
对不起,康妮。我不得不长话短说。
I'm sorry, Connie. I have to cut this short.

560
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,885
明天，我们来谈谈你的问题。
Tomorrow, we'll talk about your problems.

561
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,638
好的,超时!这已经够了!
Okay, time-out! This has gone far enough!

562
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,223
嘿。我们回家。
Hey. We're home.

563
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,767
我们得到了另一棵树。
And we got another tree.

564
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,019
一个真正的人。
A real one.

565
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,479
嗯,现在在楼上。
Um, upstairs now.

566
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,896
快，快，快，快，快，快。
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

567
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,356
推动它。不,不,拉。
Push it. No, no, pull.

568
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,482
-快，快，快，快。推动它。
-Go, go, go, go, go. -Push it up.

569
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,067
拉。不,好吧。
Pull. No, okay.

570
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,153
——右边。-为什么我有重头?
-To the right. -How come I have the heavy end?

571
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,071
因为你年轻又强壮，亲爱的。
Because you're young and strong, honey.

572
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,449
更多。
Little bit more.

573
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,615
我先!
Me first!

574
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,909
头里。-关闭。
-Come on. -Get off.

575
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,744
蒂姆?泰德?-妈妈。
-Tim? Ted? -Mom.

576
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,121
绳。绳。
Get the cord. Get the cord.

577
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,413
拿着绳子，拿着绳子，拿着绳子!
Get the cord, get the cord, get the cord!

578
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,124
你不可能消失。
You just can't disappear.

579
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,459
你需要一个借口。
You need a cover story.

580
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,960
…噢!-哦,对了。
-Ow! -Oh, right.

581
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,086
我的软肋。
My soft spot.

582
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,253
你们在哪里?
Where are you guys?

583
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,463
告诉她你在收拾东西。
Uh, uh, tell her you're packing.

584
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,299
我们在楼上收拾东西。
We're upstairs, uh, packing.

585
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,759
包装吗?为了什么?
Packing? For what?

586
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,510
哦。你要去参加兄弟情谊之旅。
Ooh. You're going on a brother bonding trip.

587
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,096
-我们要去兄弟情谊之旅。…噢!
-We're going on a brother bonding trip. -Ow!

588
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,723
现在?
Now?

589
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,392
但是，蒂姆，你的父母明天要来。

你很奇怪。我是吗?

1421
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:14,266
是的，但以一种好的方式。

为什么选美会让你这么紧张?

00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:22,692

不。不，不是这样的。

总是有人告诉我该怎么做。

-Are you? -Good God, no.

1490
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,081
这是正确的。
That's right.

1491
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:45,085
到底为什么父母能管事?
Why do parents get to be in charge, anyway?

1492
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:47,503
他们有过机会，而我们得到了什么?
They had their chance, and what did we get?

1493
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:51,675
污染、政治、战争。
Pollution, politics, wars.

1494
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:54,052
哦。
Ooh.

1495
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,096
而不是“哦”。“嘘。”
Not "ooh." "Boo."

1496
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:57,722
嘘!
Boo!

1497
00:59:57,764 --> 01:00:01,101
唯一阻碍我们的是他们，
The only thing holding us back is them,

1498
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:02,768
但现在不是了。
but not anymore.

1499
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,690
我们努力奋斗的时刻就要到来了。
The moment that we've worked so hard for is almost here.

1500
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:07,856
生日。
B-Day.

1501
01:00:07,898 --> 01:00:09,108
-B-Day吗?-B-Day。
-B-Day? -B-Day.

1502
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,235
-我这么多。-我这么多。
-I'm this many. -I'm this many.

1503
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,612
不，不，不是…今天不是你的生日。
No, no, it's not... it's not your birthday.

1504
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:16,490
这是婴儿革命的开始。
It's the beginning of the baby revolution.

1505
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:18,326
耶,耶。
Yay, yay.

1506
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:20,994
还有蛋糕。蛋糕。
And there'll be cake. Cake for everybody.

1507
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:23,789
蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!蛋糕!
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

1508
01:00:23,831 --> 01:00:25,416
没有更多的规则。
No more rules.

1509
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,293
<我>哦啦啦!< / i >
<i>Oh là là!</i>

1510
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:29,045
没有更多的父母。
No more parents.

1511
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:30,295
哦。
Uh-oh.

1512
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:31,463
皮，皮，皮，皮!
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

1513
01:00:31,505 --> 01:00:33,967
再见，妈妈和爸爸!
Sayonara, Mama and Papa!

1514
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,010
哦，这太糟糕了。
Oh, this is bad.

1515
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,929
好了，动员会结束了。
All right, pep rally's over.

1516
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,347
你父母会来接你的。
Your-your parents are gonna pick you up.

1517
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:42,976
这是我毕生的心血。
This is my life's work.

1518
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,936
是的，长达17个月。
Oh, yes, 17 long months.

1519
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:48,565
……没有更多的父母。
To... no more parents.

1520
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:50,233
嗯。
Mmm.

1521
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,693
为革命干杯。
Cheers to the revolution.

1522
01:00:53,652 --> 01:00:55,362
不。不。不。
No. Nope. Nope.

1523
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,239
-不。哦，这很值得注意。-哦,蒂娜。
-No. Oh, that's a keeper. -Oh, Tina.

1524
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:59,367
哦，太可爱了。这个应用叫什么?
Oh, it's so cute. What's the app called?

1525
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,827
-这叫QT Snap。-哦。
-It's called QT Snap. -Oh.

1526
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,786
-告诉我怎么下载。每个人都有。
-Show me how to download that. -Everyone has it.

1527
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,831
所以,马科斯……光速?
So, Marcos... Lightspeed?

1528
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:06,458
-你是这么说的吗?-嗯。
-Is that what you said? -Mm-hmm.

1529
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:08,293
听起来像个卡通名字。
Sounds like a cartoon name.

1530
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:11,338
它确实。
It really does.

1531
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:14,298
我的父母，他们有点古怪，所以…
Well, my parents, they're a little wacky, so...

1532
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:18,677
嗯。我好像在什么地方见过你。
Huh. It's like I know you from somewhere.

1533
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,054
我不这么想。
I don't think so.

1534
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:21,722
-那也是一个守护者。-嘿。嘿。
-That is a keeper, too. -Hey. Hey.

1535
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:23,766
-他看起来面熟吗?-我想我不知道。
-Doesn't he look familiar? -I don't think I do.

1536
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:25,226
是啊，他长得很像蒂姆。
Yeah, he looks just like Tim.

1537
01:01:25,268 --> 01:01:26,853
是的。你看起来像蒂姆。
Yeah. You look like Tim.

1538
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:29,063
嗯?嗯?
Hmm? -Huh?

1539
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,606
除了蒂姆没有戴眼镜。
Except Tim didn't wear glasses.

1540
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,775
哦,这是正确的。
Oh, that's right.

1541
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:35,277
嗯。嗯，怎么样。
Huh. Well, how about that.

1542
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,864
嘿，蒂姆在哪?
Hey, where is Tim, anyway?

1543
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:39,699
蒂姆和泰德在旅行。
Tim and Ted are on a trip.

1544
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,909
在一起?他们是成键。
-TED SR. and JANICE: Together? -They're bonding.

1545
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:43,994
-好吧，时间差不多了。-是的。
-Well, that's about time. -Yeah.

1546
01:01:44,036 --> 01:01:46,206
我只希望蒂姆能及时回来参加选美。
I just hope Tim's back in time for the pageant.

1547
01:01:47,748 --> 01:01:50,668
哦,为什么……他为什么不去呢?
Uh, why... why wouldn't he be there?

1548
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,711
蒂姆。蒂姆。
-Tim Time. -Tim Time.

1549
01:01:52,753 --> 01:01:53,755
哦。
Oh.

1550
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,880
就是蒂姆什么时间?
What's-what's Tim Time?

1551
01:01:54,922 --> 01:01:56,382
发问吧。-好的。
-Go ahead. -Okay.

1552
01:01:56,423 --> 01:02:00,344
马科斯，蒂姆时间就像个黑洞
Well, Marcos, Tim Time is like a black hole

1553
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:04,807
在现实和准时等方面迷失了方向。
where things like reality and being on time get lost.

1554
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:06,266
哦。
Oh.

1555
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,061
塔比瑟的父亲想象力很丰富。
Tabitha's father has a very active imagination.

1556
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:10,813
这是一件好事。
Which is a good thing.

1557
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:12,523
是的,这是一个…我得说这是件好事。
Yeah, that's a... I'd say that's a good thing.

1558
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,902
还记得他说我们老板想绑架我们吗?
Oh, remember when he said our boss was trying to kidnap us?

1559
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:17,445
他做了吗?
He did?

1560
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:20,030
或者他的小弟弟会走路和说话
Or that his baby brother could walk and talk

1561
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:21,699
但只是在我们不注意的时候。
but only when we weren't looking.

1562
01:02:24,994 --> 01:02:27,831
哇。转身。
Wow. Turn around.

1563
01:02:29,373 --> 01:02:31,041
的爸爸。
That's so Dad.

1564
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:33,753
泰德自己也挺难对付的。
You know, Ted was quite a handful himself.

1565
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:36,088
-哦，他可能很…紧张。
-Oh, he could be very... -Uptight.

1566
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,882
毫米。是的。高度紧张的。
Mm. Yes. High-strung.

1567
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:40,300
哦。还记得他起诉我们那次吗?
Oh. Remember the time he sued us?

1568
01:02:40,342 --> 01:02:43,054
青少年。啊。
Teenagers. Ugh.

1569
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,306
不过他真的很尊敬他哥哥。
He really looked up to his big brother, though.

1570
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:47,474
他吗?-哦,是的。
-He did? -Oh, yeah.

1571
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:49,309
他不肯放过他。
He wouldn't leave him alone.

1572
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:50,936
蒂姆做的每件事，泰迪都想做。
Everything Tim did, Teddy wanted to do.

1573
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:52,480
-真的?-是的。
-Really? -Yeah.

1574
01:02:52,521 --> 01:02:54,606
我们叫他泰迪。
Tagalong Teddy, we called him.

1575
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:56,775
-当然不是当面。-不,没有。
-Well, not to his face. -No, no.

1576
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,028
不是当着他的面。他很爱打官司。
Not to his face. He was very litigious.

1577
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,280
但你知道吗?你爸爸并不介意。
But you know what? Your dad didn't mind.

1578
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:03,324
他为他的小弟弟感到骄傲。
He was so proud of his little brother.

1579
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:05,159
-哦,是的。-他喜欢炫耀他。
-Oh, yeah. -He loved showing him off.

1580
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,871
他们做什么都在一起。
Those guys did everything together.

1581
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:09,956
他们是最好的朋友。
They were best friends.

1582
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,708
就像你和我。
Just like you and me.

1583
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,460
蒂娜?
Right, Tina?

1584
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,793
永远最好的朋友。
Best friends forever.

1585
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:16,128
逗怪物!
Tickle monster!

1586
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,297
这是如此甜蜜。
That's so sweet.

1587
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,474
这是我的壁橱。
And this is my closet.

1588
01:03:27,514 --> 01:03:29,309
-哦,很酷的壁橱里。-这是我的床。
-Oh, cool closet. -And this is my bed.

1589
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,268
这是我的鱼。
And this is my fish.

1590
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:35,023
-嘿，想看看非常非常酷的东西吗?-当然。
-Hey, want to see something really, really cool? -Sure.

1591
01:03:36,023 --> 01:03:37,983
我为霍金医生做了这个发声器。
I made this vocalizer for Dr. Hawking.

1592
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:39,777
嗨,我的老…
Hey, my old...

1593
01:03:39,818 --> 01:03:41,737
-你干了什么?—这一点。
-What did you do?! -Check this out.

1594
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,907
打个招呼吧，霍金博士。
Say hello, Dr. Hawking.

1595
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,826
Hell-l-l-l-l……
Hell-l-l-l-l...

1596
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:50,496
他有表现焦虑。
Um, he has performance anxiety.

1597
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:51,914
嗯哼。是的。
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1598
01:03:51,956 --> 01:03:53,583
哦，这是小羊羔。
Oh, this is Lamb Lamb.

1599
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,126
嘿,羊肉羊肉。
Hey, Lamb Lamb.

1600
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:57,836
那是我的星系模型就在我的架子上。
That's my galaxy model right up there on my shelf.

1601
01:03:57,878 --> 01:04:00,047
我的本周科学家奖。
My scientist of the week award.

1602
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,925
-哇。-我的晶洞石收藏。
-Wow. -My geode rock collection.

1603
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:03,510
我的望远镜。
And my telescope.

1604
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,677
甜的。
Sweet.

1605
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,012
-嘿,酷的吉他。-是的。
-Hey, cool guitar. -Yeah.

1606
01:04:07,054 --> 01:04:08,056
这是我爸爸的。
That's my dad's.

1607
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:09,932
酷爸爸。
Cool dad.

1608
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:11,226
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1609
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:13,519
是啊，我觉得我高多了。
Yeah, I'm a lot taller in my mind.

1610
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,731
如果你愿意，我可以帮你唱歌。
Hey, if you want, I can help you with your song.

1611
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,025
不,你不能。
No, you can't.

1612
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:20,693
-你的耳朵会流血的。-哦,谢谢。
-Your ears will bleed. -Oh, please.

1613
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,362
它会很有趣。
It'll be fun.

1614
01:04:22,403 --> 01:04:24,947
这个怎么样?这是一个经典。
How about this one? It's a classic.

1615
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:27,032
我们一定要去吗?
Do we have to?

1616
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:29,369
来吧。让我们试一试。
Come on. Let's try.

1617
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:32,121
好吧。
Okay.

1618
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:34,748
不过情况不会很好。
It's not gonna be good, though.

01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,686
我不干了!
I quit!

1782
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,814
真是一群喜欢嗅尿布的人。
What a bunch of diaper sniffers.

1783
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:16,775
看来我们得自己阻止阿姆斯特朗了。
Looks like we have to stop Armstrong ourselves.

1784
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:19,362
我们要流氓。我喜欢它。
We're going rogue. I like it.

1785
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:21,030
-任务又开始了?-是的。
-So the mission's back on? -Yeah.

1786
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:23,824
如果你们俩能再容忍一下对方。
If you two can put up with each other a little longer.

1787
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:27,119
我想我可以接受。蒂姆?
I suppose I can live with that. Tim?

1788
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:28,121
我认为这是可行的。
I think that's doable.

1789
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:29,122

这是下午8点45分。
It's 8:45 p.m.

1792

好吧。我们的时间紧迫。

1793
01:11:35,502 --> 01:11:38,590
我们得在配方失效前阻止阿姆斯特朗。
We have to stop Armstrong before the formula wears off.

1794
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:42,010
作为一个团队，我们会在选美比赛上罢工。
Working as a team, we will strike at the pageant.

1795
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:43,302
去,蒂娜。
Go, Tina.

1796
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,637
这个绝密文件…
Now, this top secret document...

这个绝密计划揭示了
This top secret program reveals

1799
01:11:49,516 --> 01:11:52,479
阿姆斯特朗计划向观众发表演讲，
that Armstrong is scheduled to address the audience,

1800
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,564
他会在这里做最后一件事。
which he will do right here at the very end.

1801
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:58,193
我们需要人在后台。蒂姆,这就是你。
We need someone backstage. Tim, that's you.

1802
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,862
如果我没参加选美，我怎么去后台?
How am I gonna get backstage if I'm not in the pageant?

1803
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,738
我的人会处理的。
My people will take care of that.

1804
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:04,990
——啊!-谢谢。
-Ah! -Thank you.

在那里,在那里。所有的更好。
There, there. All better.

太棒了。
Awesome.

1811
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,090
现在，我要在听众中做你们的眼睛和耳朵。
Now, I'll be your eyes and your ears in the audience.

1812
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:22,007
我不能让妈妈看到我说话，
I can't let Mommy see me talk,

1813
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,926
否则她会尖叫着拥抱我，
or she's gonna start squealing and hugging me,

1814
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:25,679
但这些小玩意儿能让你

它被称为GAGA设备。

1817
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,557
哦,很可爱。—出来。
-Aw, that's cute. -Check it out.

1818
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,103
爸爸，你能听到我说话吗?
Can you hear me, Daddy?

1819
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:34,354
也可爱。
Also cute.

1820
01:12:34,395 --> 01:12:36,439
与此同时，有了我的新紫色身份，

01:23:42,646 --> 01:23:44,399
谢谢。
Thanks.

2078
01:23:45,774 --> 01:23:48,319
等待。你是t-talking吗?
Wait. Are you t-talking?

2079
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,320
我知道。这很奇怪，不是吗?
I know. It's pretty weird, isn't it?

2080
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:52,573
天啊，你说话了!
Oh, my gosh, you're talking!

2081
01:23:52,614 --> 01:23:54,033
这是一个紧急情况。
It's an emergency.

2082
01:23:54,074 --> 01:23:56,368
我在执行婴儿公司的超级秘密任务。
I'm on a supersecret mission from BabyCorp.

2083
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,788
你是说爸爸的故事是真的?
You mean Dad's stories are true?

2084
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,707
诉讼是这么说的。
That's what the suit says.

2085
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,917
我看起来怎么样?
How do I look?

2086
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,336
没门!
No way!

2087
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:06,378
现在我联系不上爸爸和泰德叔叔了，
Now, I can't get ahold of Dad or Uncle Ted,

2088
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,297
所以我需要你的帮助，大姐。
so I need your help, big sis.

2089
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,923
等待,等待。爸爸的吗?
Wait, wait. Dad's here?

2090
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:11,426
他们一直都在这里。
They've been here the whole time.

2091
01:24:11,467 --> 01:24:13,386
(在吗?-我没有太多时间解释
-Where? -I don't have much time to explain,

2092
01:24:13,427 --> 01:24:15,764
但阿姆斯特朗医生还是个婴儿
but Dr. Armstrong is a baby.

2093
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,724
一个非常非常坏的孩子。
A very bad, bad baby.

2094
01:24:17,765 --> 01:24:21,603
很快，世界就会成为我们的游乐场。
Soon, the world is gonna be our playground.

2095
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:24,064
哟!-
Whee! -

2096
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,817
现在我们可以让父母做任何我们想做的事。
Now we can make parents do whatever we want.

2097
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:29,944
太棒了!是啊!
Awesome! Yeah!

2098
01:24:29,985 --> 01:24:32,905
没有更多的规则。
No more rules.

2099
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:35,617
再见，妈妈和爸爸。
Sayonara, Mama and Papa.

2100
01:24:35,658 --> 01:24:36,951
是的。
Yeah.

2101
01:24:38,118 --> 01:24:39,412
-妈妈吗?-爸爸吗?
-Mom? -Dad?

2102
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:40,412
爷爷?
Grandpa?

2103
01:24:40,454 --> 01:24:42,122
哇。你在开玩笑吗?
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

2104
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:44,250
我们得在它扩散到全球之前把它关闭。
We need to shut it down before it goes global.

2105
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,418
-是的。-我们该怎么办?
-Yeah. -What are we gonna do?

2106
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:48,671
好吧，我们得找到那个叫什么来着的大块头
Okay, we need to find the big whatchamacallit

2107
01:24:48,712 --> 01:24:50,297
它控制着父母的手机。

2108
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,841
——服务器。-是的。是的。
-The server. -Yes. Yes.

2109
01:24:51,882 --> 01:24:54,010
学校里有那种大的东西吗?
Is there a big one of those whatsits at school?

2110
01:24:54,051 --> 01:24:55,595
嗯,让我们看看。
Uh, let's see.

2111
01:24:55,636 --> 01:24:58,765
服务器非常热，所以你需要通风道。
Well, servers get really hot, so you need air ducts.

2112
01:24:58,806 --> 01:25:00,100
现在你的想法!
Now you're thinking!

2113
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,310
在橡子上相交!

机会敲门。
Opportunity knocks.

2117
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:10,944
首先，我们得去个短暂停留。
First, we need to make a quick pit stop.

2118
01:25:10,984 --> 01:25:14,279
你的时间已经结束了。
Your time has concluded.

2119
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:16,448
看来就这样了，小炯。
It looks like this is it, Tim.

2120
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,784
嘿，至少我们有过
Well, hey, at least we have

2121

这是我们在一起最后的珍贵时刻。

蒂娜，蒂娜，进来。这是爸爸。

我要做副驾驶座。
I call shotgun.

快，到橡子那儿去!
Quick, to the acorn!

哦,不。它即将走向世界。

我们要怎么上去?
How are we gonna get up there?

2156

-真的?-嗯，你有勇气。
-Really? -Well, you got grit.

进取心,甚至。非常令人钦佩。

但是，呃，很烦人。

还有你，我的小矮子protégé。
And you, my pudgy protégé.

01:27:52,313 --> 01:27:54,274
我给了你全世界。
I offered you the world.

2170
01:27:54,314 --> 01:27:55,734
我们本可以成为搭档的。
We could have been partners.

2171
01:27:55,774 --> 01:27:57,609
我有比搭档更好的东西。
I've got something better than a partner.

2172
01:27:57,652 --> 01:27:59,695
我有一个哥哥。-耶!

她穿起来更好看。
It looks better on her.

2178
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:13,376
举起手来，放下尿布。
Hands up, diapers down.

2179
01:28:13,417 --> 01:28:14,793
事情要变得奇怪了。
Things are about to get weird.

2180
01:28:14,836 --> 01:28:16,503
是的，这就是我的女儿们!
Yeah, that's my girls!

2181
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:18,465
——真的是爸爸?是的。

2182
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:20,675
我跟那孩子说了很多话。
I said a lot of stuff to that kid.

2183
01:28:20,716 --> 01:28:22,469
真是一次家庭聚会。
Well, quite the family reunion.

2184
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,927
人越多越好。
Uh, the more the merrier.

2185
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,096
-我说打电话给你父母吧。-哦,不。
-I say let's call your parents. -Oh, no.

2186
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:29,309
啊哦。-好的。
-Uh-oh. -Okay.

2187
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:31,644
妈妈和爸爸，让我们拥抱他们……死。
Mommy and Daddy, let's hug 'em... to death.

2188
01:28:31,685 --> 01:28:33,563
别担心我们。进入服务器。
Oh, don't worry about us. Get to the server.

2189
01:28:33,604 --> 01:28:35,481
蒂娜,走吧!
Go, Tina, go!

2190
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:40,362
-嘿!-你可以的，蒂娜。
-Hey! -You got this, Tina.

2191
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:41,738
从那里下来。
Get down from there.

2192
01:28:41,779 --> 01:28:43,489
去拿他的棒棒糖!
Go for his lollies!

2193
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,824
别碰别人的小马。
Never touch another man's pony.

2194
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,287
在这里。留下来。留下来。
Here. Stick around. Stick around.

2195
01:28:49,328 --> 01:28:51,706
小炯，我们现在该怎么办!
Uh, Tim, what do we do now?!

2196
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:53,667
不要动。也许他们看不到我们。
Don't move. Maybe they won't see us.

2197
01:28:53,707 --> 01:28:55,335
他们看到我们了，蒂姆。他们看到我们。
They see us, Tim. They see us.

2198
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,711
你行动了吗?我没有移动。
Did you move? I didn't move.

2199
01:28:56,752 --> 01:28:58,171
真的,蒂姆?
Really, Tim?

2200
01:28:58,212 --> 01:29:00,006
哦。嘿，现在有点太高了。
Oh. Hey, that's a little too high now.

2201
01:29:00,047 --> 01:29:02,841
不要往下看。看着前方，好吗?
Don't look down. Look straight ahead, okay?

2202
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,387
它是锁着的。
It's locked.

2203
01:29:06,429 --> 01:29:08,180
我能帮你吗?
Can I give you a hand?

2204
01:29:08,222 --> 01:29:09,474
当然，我是开玩笑的，
Of course, I mean that facetiously,

2205
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:12,185
因为手的作用是…作为一个关键。
because the hand acts as a... as a key.

2206
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:13,520
不,不。不,不,不。
No, no. No, no, no.

2207
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,229
-嘿,嘿。不，不，不。-谢谢,姐姐。
-Hey, hey. No, no, no, no. -Thanks, sis.

2208
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,524
离我的服务员远点。
Stay away from my server.

2209
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,527
-关掉它，塔比瑟。-你在干什么?
-Shut it down, Tabitha. -What are you doing?

2210
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:22,444
你在干什么?不,不,不!不!
What are you doing? No, no, no! No!

2211
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,197
不要这样做。
Don't do that.

2212
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:25,573
哦,不!
Oh, no!

2213
01:29:25,614 --> 01:29:27,199
拥抱。拥抱爷爷。
-Hugs. -Hug Grandpa.

2214
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,784

It's <i>Night of the Living Boomers.</i>

2215
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:31,871
-爸爸,停止!拥抱。
-Dad, stop! -Hugs.

2216
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,542
回来。退后，你们这些小怪物。
Back. Back, you little monsters.

2217
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,962
你给我退后，小甜心。
You back off, candy pants.

2218
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,215
哈!你的鼻子。
Ha! Got your nose.

2219
01:29:43,632 --> 01:29:46,051
哦，就在面包筐里!
Oh, right in the breadbasket!

2220
01:29:53,518 --> 01:29:54,769
…噢!哈!
-Ow! -Ha!

2221
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:56,229
-把他的街区打飞了。——啊,猫粪。
-Knocked his block off. -Ah, poopy.

2222
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,064
蒂娜，我想我知道了。是的!
Tina, I think I got it. Yes!

2223
01:29:58,105 --> 01:30:00,233
不要按那个按钮。不要按那个按钮。啊!
Don't hit that button. Don't hit that button. Aah!

2224

-看看你让我做了什么。——火灾报警。
-Look what you made me do. -The fire alarm.

2228

泰德叔叔!拉火警!

2230
01:30:13,829 --> 01:30:15,414
-姑娘们需要帮助。-不想吻你!

姑娘们需要我们。
The girls need us.

2232
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:20,545
时间到了,半身人。
Time's up, halflings.

01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:23,590
伟大的飞奔的怪兽!

蒂姆!快去看火警报警器!

我会拖住他们。
I'll hold them back.

2237
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:33,099
下雨吧，宝贝。
Make it rain, baby.

2238
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,434
我在它。
I'm on it.

2239
01:30:34,475 --> 01:30:35,894
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

2240
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:37,479
你应付不了尴尬阶段?
You can't handle the awkward phase?

2241
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:40,981
去,马科斯……哦,爸爸。走吧!
Go, Marcos... uh, Dad. Go!

2242

-行去。头里。

01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,112
再来一轮怎么样，硬汉?来吧!
How about another round, you tough guy? Come on!

2245
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:47,529
噢。阻止它。
Ow. Stop it.

2246
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:48,948
我还留着这些。
I still got these.

2247
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:50,617
你把我妹妹放下来了。
You put my sister down.

2248
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:53,828
无论你喜不喜欢，生日总会到来的。
B-Day will happen, whether you like it or not.

2249
01:30:53,869 --> 01:30:56,122
你不能通过!

2250
01:30:56,163 --> 01:30:58,041
你不能通过。
Uh, you shall not pass.

不!停止流逝。
No! Stop passing.

2252
01:31:01,502 --> 01:31:02,712
是的,爸爸!
Yeah, Dad!

路要走!
Way to go!

2254
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:07,884
就这些吗?
That's it?

2255
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:10,177
这是正确的。为什么?什么?学校的贵。
That's right. Why? What? The school's expensive.

2256
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,305
我不得不削减开支。
I had to cut costs someplace.

2257
01:31:13,347 --> 01:31:14,474
哦,不。这不是工作。
Oh, no. It's not working.

2258
01:31:14,515 --> 01:31:15,641
你拉对了吗?
Did you pull it right?

2259
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:16,975
你还能怎么做?
How else you gonna pull it?

2260
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:19,020
你会发现我是对的。
You'll see I'm right.

2261
01:31:19,061 --> 01:31:20,646
我会告诉每一个人。
I'll show everybody.

2262
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:23,817
父母的时代已经过去了。
The age of parents is over.

2263
01:31:28,697 --> 01:31:31,157
耶,耶,耶。
Yay, yay, yay.

2264
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:33,827
你看我祝酒怎么样?
How about you watch me have a little toast?

2265
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:37,122
敬婴儿革命和我自己。
To the baby revolution and to me.

2266
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,627
-该看糖果火山了…-嗯,嗯。
-It's time for the candy volcano... -Mmm, mmm.

2267
01:31:42,668 --> 01:31:44,503
-哦,这很好。塔比瑟和蒂娜:厄运!
-Oh, that's good. -TABITHA and TINA: Of doom!

2268
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:46,506
你在干什么?你在干什么?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

2269
01:31:46,547 --> 01:31:48,007
不,不,不!不!

-No, no, no. -Boom shakalaka?

2272
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,846
繁荣!不要那样做!
-Boom! -Don't do that!

2273
01:31:58,475 --> 01:32:00,729
哇!
Whoa!

2274
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,354
哦,不!
Oh, no!

2275
01:32:02,396 --> 01:32:03,856
塔比瑟!
Tabitha!

2276
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:06,734
不!谁来帮帮我，拜托!
No! Someone help me, please!

2277
01:32:06,775 --> 01:32:08,694
塔比瑟,稍等!
Tabitha, hang on!

2278
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,030
泰德，我需要upsies…现在。
Ted, I need upsies... now.

2279
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:19,204
爸爸,救救我!

01:32:19,247 --> 01:32:20,331
看看你。
Look at you.

你聪明。你强。
You're smart. You're strong.

2282
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,542
你不需要父母。
You don't need parents.

2283
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:25,587
他们能给你带来什么?
What can they possibly offer you?

2284
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:28,047
那无条件的爱呢?
How about unconditional love?

2285
01:32:28,088 --> 01:32:29,798
这就是。-不,不,不。不。
-That's what. -No, no, no. No.

2286
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:32,010
再会。-不,不,不。不。

我得到了你。

谢谢,马科斯光速。
Thanks, Marcos Lightspeed.

2295
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:06,627
Mwah。
Mwah.

2296
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:09,463
我以为我们都得长大。
I thought we both had to grow up.

2297
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:11,925
好吧，我们不要长大得太快。
Well, let's not grow up too fast.

2298
01:33:13,467 --> 01:33:14,844
我爱您，爸爸。

2301
01:33:19,015 --> 01:33:21,266
而你想把这一切都夺走。
And you wanted to take it all away.

2302
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:22,769
那你要去哪里?分离聚合。

医生，童年不会永远持续下去，
You know, Doc, childhood doesn't last forever,

2304
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:27,524
但家人肯定知道。

作为奖励，我们也阻止了阿姆斯特朗。

我不喜欢把两者混在一起，
I don't like to mix the two,

2332
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:48,729
但我想说，这从来不是生意。
but I will say it was never business.

2333
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:50,273
这都是私人恩怨。
It was always personal.

2334
01:34:50,314 --> 01:34:51,649
你知道吗，孩子?
You know what, kid?

2335
