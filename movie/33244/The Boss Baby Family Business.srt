1
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,190
Time is a funny thing.

2
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,230
- When I was a kid...
- One.

3
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,940
-...the days lasted forever.
-Two.

4
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,320
-Hide, hide, hide!
-Three.

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,940
- But the years...
- Wait! Over here.

6
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,280
-...well, they went by so fast.
-Four.

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,150
-Five. Six.
-Tim, no peeking.

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,490
Yeah, no peeking.

9
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,950
- Before you know it...
- Seven.

10
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,320
-...you're all grown-up.
-Eight.

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,280
-It even happened to me.
-Nine.

12
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,290
Nine and a half. Ten!

13
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,500
Ready or not, here I come.

14
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,750
My name's Tim, and this...

15
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,750
well, this is
the rest of my story.

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,460
Run for your lives!

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,130
No fair, Dad. You peeked.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,090
-They call me a stay-at-home
dad, which means...-Let's go!

19
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,140
...I hardly get
to stay at home.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,100
Buckle up, Templetons.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,720
Ready?

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,430
-Set.
-Go!

23
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,350
Now, some might say

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,610
I still have
an overactive imagination,

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,070
but being a dad is
the coolest job in the world.

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,740
Bunch of cool jobs, really.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,950
Sometimes I'm
a race car driver.

28
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,160
Whoo! Daddy-o Andretti!

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,660
Yay, Templetons!

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,290
Well, and then sometimes

31
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,870
I'm the best darn cook
in the county

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,160
and I deal out every meal.

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,420
Come on, Pa, hit me.

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,290
Tina.

35
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,550
Whew, doggie!
And the house wins again.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,300
Yay! -TABITHA: Woo-hoo!

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,920
Or a
surgeon, if need be.

38
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,930
-Spork.
-Spork.

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,800
-Spatula.
-Spatula.

40
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,390
Give my creature life!

41
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,690
She's alive!

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,980
We have our ups,
and we have our downs.

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,360
No, no, no. Look. Look.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,650
-Lamb Lamb's okay. See?
-Yay!

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,480
But we always stick together.

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,650
-My wife, Carol.
-It's a miracle!

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,610
She's the
breadwinner of the family.

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,530
--Thank you.
You know what they say:

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,240
"It's all about the dough."

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
And I couldn't have done it
without my husband.

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,750
He really rose to the occasion.

52
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,000
- It's the yeast I can do.
- -Yeah, Mama!

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,210
She brings home the bacon, too,

54
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,420
while I keep an eye
on our new baby, Tina.

55
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,420
But sometimes, feels like

56
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,380
she's keeping an eye on me.

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,010
-And Tabitha...
-Thank you!

58
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,180
...our little second-grader
who just got accepted

59
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,800
into the best school in town.

60
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,140
Yay, Tabitha!

61
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,640
We're so proud.

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,310
I still keep in touch
with the old gang, too.

63
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,850
Believe it or not,
Jimbo is mayor now.

64
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,600
- Cookie!
- Of course, his wife, Staci,

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,440
is the real brains
behind the operation.

66
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,320
- Yo, Jimbo!
- Now, the Triplets...

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,730
-* Busted... *
-* Busted... *

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,360
* Busted. *

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,030
Yeah,
they haven't changed much.

70
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,910
And as for
my baby brother, Ted,

71
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,030
well, he grew up
to be the boss, all right.

72
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,620
He's so busy we hardly see
him anymore.-

73
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,450
But, hey, he always remembers

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,910
to send inappropriately
lavish gifts

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,710
on special occasions.

76
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,540
OMG! Uncle Ted is the best!

77
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,340
All in all,

78
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,260
my life is pretty perfect.

79
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,850
But all that
was about to change.

80
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,140
Good heavens.

81
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,310
I'll save you!

82
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,310
Ha!

83
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,900
Thanks, babe.

84
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,310
Stay calm, Tabitha.

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,770
I'm coming for you.

86
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm gonna save you
from the bubbling lava!

87
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,410
Dad, what are you doing?

88
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,820
Ew, gross. It went everywhere.

89
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,410
Come on, this is
the candy volcano of doom!

90
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,620
You used to love it.

91
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,750
But I'm trying
to do my homework,

92
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,250
or I'm doomed.

93
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh.

94
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,210
Because if there's
one thing I've learned,

95
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,920
you're only a kid once.

96
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,300
Once you grow up,
you can never go back.

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,510
Ee...!

98
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,980
Oh, no.

99
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,730
Good night, Dr. Hawking.

100
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,820
Carbon, boron, beryllium,
lithium, helium, hydrogen.

101
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,910
Nailed it.

102
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,830
Boom shakalaka.

103
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,460
"Carry the four."
Gosh.

104
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,080
Hey there, Tabitha.

105
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,630
It's The Good Night Show.

106
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,550
Live from your bedroom,
starring Dad and Mom.

107
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,300
And special guest, baby Tina.

108
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,470
Good night, little Tina. Mwah!

109
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,260
Come back here, you.

110
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,850
-Good night, Mom.
-Mwah!

111
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,520
Good night, sweetheart.
Mama's gonna kiss you.

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,980
Mama gonna kiss you.

113
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,190
* Good night song *

114
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,690
-* With your dad... *
-What?

115
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,310
What? It's time for
your good-night song.

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,020
Oh, no, thanks.

117
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm listening to white noise!

118
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,990
Helps me fall asleep!

119
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,370
Hey, what would you say

120
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,330
to me helping you rehearse
for the holiday pageant?

121
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,790
Yes! Right?

122
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,660
I can come to school with you,
and you can get

123
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,330
all your friends together,
and we can rehearse together,

124
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,330
go get some ice cream after.

125
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,420
-My treat.
-No! You can't do that.

126
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Um, liability issues.

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,340
It's this whole thing.

128
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh. Right, right.

129
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,930
Right.

130
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,550
Whoa. How about your favorite
bedtime story?

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,470
You know, the one about...

132
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,560
Uncle Ted was
a magical talking baby.

133
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
There was a rocket
full of puppies,

134
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,600
and you saved the world.

135
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,020
It was a good story, wasn't it?

136
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,070
Well, it didn't really make
a lot of sense.

137
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,860
The jokes were good, right?

138
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,320
Mm.

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
-Okay. Um...
-Dad.

140
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,030
My schedule is brutal tomorrow.

141
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,040
Yeah. My schedule's
pretty brutal, too.

142
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,040
Oh, don't forget Lamb Lamb.

143
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,870
Good night, Lamb Lamb.

144
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,790
Good night, Uncle Ted.

145
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,630
I hope to grow up and be
a success, just like you.

146
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,920
Maybe we'll see you soon.

147
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,930
Good night, Tabitha.

148
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,930
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

149
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,600
Uh, okay.

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,150
I think it's time
we both grow up.

151
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,530
I look forward to greeting you
at the breakfast table.

152
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,830
Sweet dreams.

153
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,720
Hmm.

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,440
Where has the time gone?

155
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,900
How should I know?

156
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,690
Wait, wait. I see light.

157
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,650
You, oh, out of my way.

158
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,780
At long last.

159
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,490
The sweet breath of freedom.

160
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,740
Wizzie?

161
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,450
You there,
what century is this?

162
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,790
Unhand me, vile ogre!

163
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,380
No, no, no, no.
Wizzie, it's me.

164
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,920
It's Tim.

165
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,880
Is it really you?

166
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,550
Come closer.

167
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,510
Let me see your face.

168
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,300
Closer.

169
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,390
Closer still.

170
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,220
Oh, Timothy.

171
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,470
It is you.

172
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,180
Hey! What was that for?

173
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,390
You cast me into
eternal darkness

174
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,310
and wreaked havoc
on my circadian rhythms.

175
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,650
I'm sorry, Wizzie.

176
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,320
Hey, but you look great,
though.

177
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,530
Except for the arm, you mean.

178
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,820
I didn't even notice.

179
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,240
-You thought it.
-I mean, I noticed it,

180
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,860
'cause I... you obviously
don't have an arm. I-I...

181
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,780
You would never treat
Lamb Lamb this way.

182
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,580
Well, I... I gave her
to my daughter, Tabitha.

183
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,370
You have produced
an heir, Timothy?

184
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,710
Two, actually.

185
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,250
Two? Let the bells ring!

186
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,290
-No, no, no. Wizzie, stop.
-Yes! Yes!

187
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,170
-Wizzie, shh! Quiet, quiet.
-It's a time for celebration!

188
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,170
No, no, no. It's not
the time for celebration.

189
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,880
-Wizzie, shh. Be quiet.
-What? What is it?

190
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,800
-What is it, Tim?
-I don't know.

191
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
I guess I'm just not feeling

192
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,760
very celebratory right now.

193
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,680
Oh?

194
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,520
Tabitha.

195
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,690
Man, Wizzie,
she's growing up so fast.

196
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,730
It's like she doesn't even
need me anymore.

197
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,320
Yes, first, they start
spending less time with you.

198
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,780
Mm.

199
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,990
Then they stop coming
to you for advice.

200
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,990
Exactly.

201
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,120
Soon, they take you
for granted.

202
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,530
I guess.

203
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,490
-Then break your arm.
-What?

204
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,080
Then stuff you into a box!

205
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
Okay. Wizzie, you're...
you're not helping.

206
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,710
Okay, I'm just... I'm afraid

207
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,790
Tabitha and I
are growing apart,

208
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,880
like... like I did
with my brother.

209
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,590
Oh.

210
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,680
I thought we had
all the time in the world.

211
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,390
But you can't
turn back time, can you?

212
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,020
How dare you question my power!

213
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,440
-Turn back. Turn back.
-Oh, here we go.

214
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,060
- Oh, great wheel of li...
- Wait.

215
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,900
Did you hear that?

216
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,900
Never abuse the snooze button!

217
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,990
It sounds like it's
coming from the baby's room.

218
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,990
What is it?
A creature of the night?

219
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,080
Witches? Is it the baying
of the hounds of hell?

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,410
Wizzie!

221
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,580
Don't go, Tim!

222
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,160
I can turn back time--

223
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,750
to the golden years,
when it was just you and me.

224
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,420
My good arm.

225
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,170
Don't open the door.

226
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,090
Remember last time!

227
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
If you would
like to make a call,

228
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,300
please hang up and try again.

229
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,480
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

230
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,270
Thank you.

231
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,440
Hello?

232
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,020
If you would like
to make a call,

233
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,690
-please hang up and try again.
-Ah. Just my phone.

234
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,820
Get it together, man.

235
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,150
Oh, Tina, you little klepto...

236
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,240
Nighty night.

237
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,450
...maniac!

238
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,120
Whoa!

239
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,870
Hi, Daddy.

240
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,960
T-Tabitha? Is that you?

241
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,670
You should've seen your face.

242
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,550
Oh, it's priceless.

243
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,050
You're... You... You-you...

244
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,970
You-you can talk?

245
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,140
Yep.
I'm in the family business.

246
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,810
It's a clip-on tie.

247
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,100
You see, Daddy,
BabyCorp is more of what I...

248
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,770
Oops.

249
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,150
Daddy, Daddy, come in.
Can you hear me?

250
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,770
Daddy, do you read me?

251
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,480
Daddy, how many fingers
am I holding up?

252
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,690
Thursday?

253
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,990
I should've given you
a warning.

254
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,530
I forgot you were an old man.

255
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,030
Wait, wait.

256
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,910
-You're from BabyCorp?
-Yes.

257
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,910
BabyCorp is more of what I call

258
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,750
-a side hustle for me.
-Uh-huh.

259
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,830
The point is I'm all in
on the Templetons.

260
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,330
-Go, Templetons!
-Oh! Okay.

261
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,170
You guys really know
how to baby a baby.

262
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,750
- I mean, it's incredible.
- Oh, oh.

263
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,340
Not that's it's all five-star.

264
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,340
-I have to say, you got
a lot of issues. -Sure. Yeah.

265
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,550
We'll talk about that later.

266
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,970
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe this.

267
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,140
Hey, want to go scare
the crap out of Mom?

268
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,100
- Daddy, please stay focused.
- Oh.

269
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,640
Right, right, right.

270
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,350
There's a crisis at BabyCorp.

271
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,480
What is it this time?

272
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Kittens?

273
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,650
No. This time, it's even worse.

274
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,900
-Worse than kittens?
-Yes.

275
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,690
That's why I volunteered for

276
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,570
- this supersecret assignment.
- Mommy.

277
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,490
Ooh, I want to help.
What-what do you want me to do?

278
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,030
That's the spirit, Daddy.

279
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,870
-You are exactly who I need.
-Yes!

280
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,660
To get Uncle Ted.

281
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,370
No. What?

282
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,870
What-What's with the face?

283
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,370
Daddy, BabyCorp can't wait
any longer.

284
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,670
All the pressure's on me, Pop.

285
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,880
When I volunteered
for this gig,

286
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,800
I thought it would be easy.

287
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,380
But you two never
see each other.

288
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,960
It's so sad.

289
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,180
It's like, "F-minus.
See me after class."

290
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,720
Sad? Uh, yeah, maybe.

291
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,930
A little. I don't know.

292
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,350
Did you forget to call him?

293
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,270
I noticed you can be
a little absentminded.

294
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,640
Sorry, what?

295
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,390
It's just that you tend
to procrastinate.

296
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,560
You have to get him here for
the holidays. -

297
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,860
No, I'm not...

298
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,270
No, I'm not
gonna call him right now.

299
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,730
- Daddy, can't never could.
- No. -

300
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,110
Did you two have
a fight or something?

301
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,900
-No.
-But you're mad at him?

302
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,200
Stop that. It's complicated.

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
Why? Do you need help using
your phone? -

304
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,080
No, I don't need help
using my... -

305
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,620
Okay. What's the problem?--

306
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,120
What's the issue?
Talk to me.

307
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,870
There's no point, okay?

308
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,920
I call him. I invite him.
He never shows up.

309
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,920
He's always got a work meeting
or a business trip

310
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,590
or a conference call.

311
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,460
All he cares about is work.

312
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,430
But after a while, you...
you just stop trying.

313
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,640
He's still your brother.

314
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,930
You were partners.

315
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah, I guess sometimes
you just... -

316
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,810
you grow up and grow apart.

317
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,570
Daddy, don't say no.

318
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,980
What if everybody said no?

319
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,150
Nothing would happen.

320
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,570
Nothing would get
off the ground.

321
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,900
You got to wake up every day

322
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,700
and you got to say,
"Yes, yes, yes!"

323
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,120
Surprise me. Say yes.

324
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,790
This is really disappointing.

325
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,080
-And now I'm getting mad!
-It's late.

326
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,170
We can work on this
tomorrow, okay?

327
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,800
Oh. Whoopsie.
Your little horsey fell off.

328
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,340
Another day won't hurt, right?

329
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,850
Good night, sweetie.

330
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,640
Good night, sweetie.

331
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,480
...horsey fell off.

332
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,150
Tabitha?

333
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,500
Huh?

334
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,400
Uh, don't worry. I got it.

335
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,280
Where is she? Where is she?

336
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,030
-Where's who? What?
-I came as fast as I could.

337
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,580
-Ted?
-I canceled all my meetings.

338
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,540
What are you doing here?
Why are you yelling?

339
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,790
-Where's Tabitha?
-Tabitha?

340
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,210
- Where is she, Tim?
- Ted.

341
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,870
Uncle Ted, you're here!
You're really here.

342
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,460
-Which arm is it?
Left or right? -Huh?

343
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,380
-Is it your fibula? Talk to me.
-Whoa.

344
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,050
Good dilation. Open up.

345
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,960
-Say, "Ah." Are you okay?
-Wh-What are you doing?

346
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,260
-You look okay.
-Whoa.

347
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,050
Don't worry.
I'm fine, Uncle Ted.

348
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,390
-That's my girl.
-Woo-hoo.

349
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,010
Uh, wh-what brings you
into town?

350
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,390
Well, Tabitha fell
off her pony.

351
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,220
-She did?
-She did?

352
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,230
I did?

353
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,390
-Tim left me a voice mail.
-He did?

354
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,940
-I did?
-You did.

355
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,860
Hello. This is your brother.

356
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,570
Help. Tabitha fell off horsey.

357
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,820
Good night, sweetie.

358
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,490
Well, that was unsettling.

359
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,070
I swear I didn't
leave that message.

360
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,160
On... purpose.

361
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,290
I...

362
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,290
Butt-dialed?

363
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,790
With my butt.

364
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,160
While I was talking
in my sleep.

365
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,750
I do that sometimes.

366
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,380
You sleep-butt-dialed me?

367
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,460
With my butt.

368
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,880
I knew there must be a
perfectly logical explanation.

369
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,680
And there it is.

370
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,590
Hmm. -All that matters
is that you're here.

371
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,800
Woo-hoo! Yay!

372
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,260
Absolutely. Uh, for now.

373
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,270
Uncle Ted, please stay
for Christmas. Please.

374
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,940
Sorry, sweetie. I can't
do Christmas on the 25th.

375
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,190
But, Uncle Ted,
I missed you so much.

376
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,940
I missed you so much.

377
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,610
-I missed you so much.
-Mm... wah!

378
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,570
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

379
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,280
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

380
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,950
Don't you think
I'm a little old for that now?

381
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,990
Can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

382
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,370
Alone.

383
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,370
The baby, Tim?

384
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,040
She's been sent from up there.

385
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,710
-Upstairs?
-That's right. BabyCorp.

386
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,260
So you're saying the voice mail
was some kind of call for help.

387
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,260
Yes! No.

388
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,180
She comes from a secret
corporation run by babies.

389
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,140
Tim, I'm gonna give you
the name of a doctor.

390
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,980
Roy Federman. Just tell him
I sent you, okay?

391
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,230
What are they saying?

392
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,730
We should give them
some privacy.

393
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,020
-Here you go.
-Ooh. Thanks.

394
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm not crazy!

395
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,110
You just don't remember.
Tell him, Tina.

396
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,440
- He... I...
- She can't talk, Tim.

397
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,150
Stop interrupting.

398
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,490
Interrupting what?
I don't hear anything.

399
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,660
Except your obnoxious voice.
You hear that.

400
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,830
I have a beautiful voice.

401
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,240
Fine.

402
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,120
I can prove that
everything I'm saying is real.

403
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,500
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

404
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,500
Suck it, Ted.

405
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
I beg your pardon?

406
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,670
You, suck.

407
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,130
No, no, Tim. You suck.

408
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,500
Time to go buy
a Christmas tree.

409
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,210
But we already have
a Christmas tree.

410
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,420
-No, we don't. No, we don't.
-Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

411
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,010
Suck it, suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it, suck it.

412
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,550
-Get that pacie out of my face!
-Excuse me.

413
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,680
I hate to interrupt,
but may I make a suggestion?

414
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,060
Why don't you both suck it?

415
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,020
Ha!

416
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,810
-She can talk.
-A lot.

417
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,610
Buckle up, boys.

418
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,860
Baby on board!

419
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,070
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Woo-hoo!

420
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,590
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

421
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Wow.

422
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm home.

423
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,020
Yeah. See?

424
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,480
It's all real.

425
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,560
Whoa.

426
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,730
Is that me?

427
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,480
If you're fishing for
a compliment, you caught one!

428
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,900
You are a legend in this joint.

429
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,400
A statue?

430
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,950
Well, I did single-handedly
save the company.

431
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,490
Double-handedly.

432
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,910
Right? We were partners.

433
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,040
Really?

434
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,750
I don't see your statue.

435
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,370
I still love you, Daddy.

436
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,370
They got the head size right.

437
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,920
Take it from me,
you have to be aggressive

438
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,210
if you want to get ahead.

439
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,920
Climb that corporate ladder

440
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,590
until you're the last baby
standing at the top. - Wow.

441
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,550
Actually, I prioritize
a good work-life balance

442
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,100
and a positive environment
where my ideas are valued.

443
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,640
Oh, you're serious.

444
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,520
You're funny, Uncle Ted.

445
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,770
I wonder why they didn't
mention that in your file.

446
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,940
My file?

447
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,480
You saw my file?

448
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,780
-Yep.
-What does it say?

449
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,110
It says a lot.

450
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,530
-This is the Crisis Center.
-Whoa. Wow.

451
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,030
This is where we monitor
all threats

452
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,030
to babies around the world.

453
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,330
And Hawaii.

454
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,120
This is so cool.
This is so cool.

455
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,120
I'm Godzilla.

456
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,670
"Oh, run for your lives!
Run for your lives!"

457
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,040
-Why did we bring him?
-Daddy, get down from there.

458
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,800
-Aw. -We can play on it later
when no one is looking.

459
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,510
-What's the crisis?
-Yeah.

460
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,130
Here we go.
What's the crisis, sweetie?

461
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,550
Rusty, roll it.

462
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,470
He's new.

463
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,310
Just imagine, baby surgeons.

464
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,640
Uh-oh.

465
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,980
Or baby astronauts.

466
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,150
Floaty, floaty, float.

467
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,490
Yes, babies are gonna
run the world one day.

468
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,740
And that day is coming
sooner than you think.

469
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,740
Hello. My name is
Dr. Erwin Armstrong,

470
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,330
founder of The Acorn Center
for Advanced Childhood.

471
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,290
Wait a minute, that's...
that's Tabitha's school.

472
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,670
Here at the center,
we believe babies

473
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,290
are the ultimate
learning machines.

474
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,250
Isn't that right,
little Nathan?

475
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,420
- Yeah!
- Okay.

476
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,010
They should use
their precious time

477
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,470
to develop faster, push harder.

478
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,890
- Hmm. -
-Parents, they have the best

479
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,850
intentions, of course,
but they're not experts.

480
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,980
After all, the only thing
holding your child back is...

481
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,770
- you.
- You!

482
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,480
This explains why Tabitha's
been pulling away from me.

483
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,400
- It's the school.
- Everybody, wave.

484
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,990
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, Mommy!

485
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,240
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, Daddy!

486
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,860
Sayonara.

487
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,950
Now, in the past six months,

488
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,950
these schools have been
popping up all over the world.

489
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,200
Uh, so what's the problem?

490
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,870
The school is the problem.

491
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,330
Yeah. School is evil.

492
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,540
No, Daddy,
not all schools are evil.

493
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,670
-It's just this one, okay?
-Okay.

494
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,800
If Armstrong's philosophy
keeps spreading,

495
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,970
it could be
the end of childhood.

496
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,430
No.

497
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,760
Childhood was the worst
three years of my life.

498
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,350
That's so sad.

499
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,220
You probably just
didn't do it right.

500
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,520
-Huh?
-Aw.

501
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,770
But luckily, you get a do-over.

502
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,980
A second chance.

503
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,650
BabyCorp has developed
a new super-duper baby formula

504
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,570
that can turn a grown-up
back into a baby. -

505
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,910
We have it in cherry, grape,
orange and lime.

506
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,700
-For real?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

507
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,660
-You want me to be a baby?
-Hey, it's what you do best.

508
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,790
So you can infiltrate
the school and find out

509
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,500
what Dr. Armstrong
is really up to.

510
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,080
BabyCorp will
take care of the rest.

511
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,590
It's the perfect disguise.

512
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,550
And it only lasts
48 teensy-weensy hours.

513
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,340
Oh, I am in on the mission.

514
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,510
-Sorry, Pops.
-Ow.

515
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,390
-It's not your mission.
-Aw.

516
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,430
"Warning:
may cause drooling, babbling,

517
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,270
"emotional outbursts,
fits of laughter,

518
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,270
loss of bowel control,
chubby thighs"?

519
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,110
I think some guys at my gym
take this stuff.

520
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,030
My texting hand!

521
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,360
Even though it is your
daughter's school. -

522
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,860
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

523
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,370
Daddy, no. Please stop.

524
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,780
Whoa!

525
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,410
What? It actually works.

526
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,460
It's mine!

527
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,290
-I'm better with
this kind of thing! -Oh!

528
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,130
And what kind of thing is that,
Flock of Seagulls?

529
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,800
-Everything!
-Gotcha!

530
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,640
You might feel very emotional,
have some mood swings.

531
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,180
Oh!

532
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,730
Hey!

533
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,020
Ouch.
There's the awkward stage.

534
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,650
Now, the tea's hot, Connie.

535
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,650
You always have to be
the hero, don't you?

536
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,570
What's that supposed to mean?

537
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,820
Never see him...

538
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,820
All of a sudden,
he shows up with a pony.

539
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,070
You're just jealous,
helmet head.

540
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,490
She's my daughter!

541
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,160
She's my niece.

542
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
Do you want cream or sugar?

543
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,710
I was always
the successful one.

544
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,340
Mommy says no running
in the house.

545
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,590
Mm.

546
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,840
Hand over the bottle, mullet.

547
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,010
You can't hug money, you know.

548
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,140
But you can, Tim. You can.

549
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,060
Men. Am I right?

550
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,950
It's not personal.

551
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,780
It's business, Leslie.

552
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,910
Well, it's personal
to me, Lindsey.

553
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,880
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Ow, ow, ow!

554
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,750
I'm sorry, Connie.
I have to cut this short.

555
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,880
Tomorrow, we'll talk
about your problems.

556
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,630
Okay, time-out!
This has gone far enough!

557
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,220
Hey. We're home.

558
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,760
And we got another tree.

559
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,010
A real one.

560
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,470
Um, upstairs now.

561
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,890
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

562
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,350
Push it. No, no, pull.

563
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,480
-Go, go, go, go, go.
-Push it up.

564
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,060
Pull. No, okay.

565
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,150
-To the right.
-How come I have the heavy end?

566
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,070
Because you're young
and strong, honey.

567
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,440
Little bit more.

568
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,610
Me first!

569
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,900
- Come on.
- Get off.

570
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,740
-Tim? Ted?
-Mom.

571
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,120
Get the cord. Get the cord.

572
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,410
Get the cord,
get the cord, get the cord!

573
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,120
You just can't disappear.

574
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,450
You need a cover story.

575
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,960
- Ow!
- Oh, right.

576
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,080
My soft spot.

577
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,250
Where are you guys?

578
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,460
Uh, uh, tell her
you're packing.

579
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,300
We're upstairs, uh, packing.

580
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,760
Packing? For what?

581
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,510
Ooh. You're going on
a brother bonding trip.

582
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,090
-We're going on
a brother bonding trip. -Ow!

583
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,720
Now?

584
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,390
But, Tim, your parents
are coming tomorrow.

585
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,100
They can help out.

586
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,970
Yeah, they could help out.

587
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,890
What... No, you can't leave me
alone with your parents.

588
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,560
Oh, Tina!

589
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,230
What are you doing?

590
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,940
All right, you know what?
You're going to baby jail.

591
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,780
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! -Tabitha!

592
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,280
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
- A little help here.

593
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,740
Honey, hold it up. Hold it up.

594
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,450
This is Ted Templeton, a man.

595
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,160
You can go ahead and take off.
I have urgent family business.

596
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,370
- To the right, honey.
- Yes, I have a family.

597
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,290
Tim, I'm coming up there.

598
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,250
Yeah, we need to talk.

599
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,920
Hey, Mom?

600
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,130
Oh! Tina!

601
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,590
Put that down.
Put that down. Put that down.

602
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,970
-Put that down. Put that down.
-Tina!

603
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,800
Put that down! Get back here!

604
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,300
Tina, stop!

605
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,430
What has gotten into you?

606
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,140
Time for us to go!

607
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,640
- What? Now?
- Yeah.

608
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,520
-My helicopter's double-parked.
-Bye!

609
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,690
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So soon? -Oh, no.

610
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,860
What... Did they really
just leave?

611
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,990
Yep.

612
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,870
Hide!

613
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,910
I got to lose this baby fat.

614
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,670
Tina! What is your problem?

615
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,420
Now, you're gonna
wake up tomorrow

616
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,050
and be good, Tina.

617
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,390
No more devil baby.

618
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,680
Deal?

619
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,010
Okay.

620
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,480
Ew.

621
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,190
Thanks so much
for coming in, ladies.

622
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,530
Would you like some fruit?

623
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,570
Mm. Ow!

624
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,570
What was... Hey!

625
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,150
Uh, can we get on with this?

626
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,030
I miss my teeth.

627
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,080
I've decided who's going
on the mission.

628
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,330
Thank you. I accept.

629
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,410
Both of you.

630
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,960
-Yes!
-No.

631
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,710
BabyCorp wants to get
the team back together, huh?

632
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,830
No.

633
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,210
They think that's
a terrible idea.

634
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,380
Of course they do.

635
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,210
Well, I'm the boss, applesauce.

636
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,220
And I think you two are better
together than you are apart.

637
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,510
Well, I work alone--
or at least not with him.

638
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,550
Hey. There's no "I" in "team."

639
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,560
Actually, there's no "U"
in "team," either,

640
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,770
-but there is an "M-E."
-T-E-A-M...

641
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,730
But teamwork doesn't seem work.

642
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,100
Ah. If you want something
done right, do it yourself.

643
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,650
-We're all in it together.
-Every man for himself.

644
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,400
One is the loneliest number.

645
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,280
-The ayes have it.
-We the people!

646
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,150
Aha!

647
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,740
Oh. So sorry.

648
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,160
Okay. Good night.

649
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,580
Whew.

650
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,700
Guess we'll just have to
melt down your big old statue

651
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,580
and turn it into
participation trophies.

652
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,420
Please, no,
don't hurt my statue.

653
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,500
Now, we have secret intel

654
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,630
that Dr. Armstrong leaves his
office every morning at 11:15.

655
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,130
You need to sneak in there,

656
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,390
plant these
surveillance devices,

657
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,430
and report back to me.

658
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,560
Oh, man, this is so cool.

659
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,720
Testing.

660
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,100
* Strangers in the night... *

661
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,600
Now, I've arranged
for a school bus

662
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,940
to be here at 8:00 a.m. sharp!

663
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,560
- Thank you, Connie.
- Nighty night.

664
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,070
Do not be late.

665
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,320
Got it.

666
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,280
Easy-breezy, taco-peasy, boys.

667
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,150
Let's get some sleep!

668
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,180
Hey, what's the matter?

669
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,930
It's nothing.

670
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,310
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

671
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,640
I'm sure your dad will be back

672
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,310
in time to see you
in the pageant.

673
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,690
That's okay.

674
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,060
What?
Don't you want him to come?

675
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,650
- I guess.
- Of course you do.

676
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,610
Now, go back to sleep.

677
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,030
Good night, Mom.

678
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,360
Good night, sweetie.

679
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,180
Don't you want him to come?

680
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,090
I guess.

681
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,770
Don't you think I'm
a little old for that now?

682
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,520
I think it's time
we both grow up.

683
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,610
The trial of
Timothy Leslie Templeton

684
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,030
is now in session.

685
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,400
Ha! Leslie.

686
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,530
Trial? Wait, what...
what are the charges?

687
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,860
Fraud.

688
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,530
Claiming to be
the world's best dad.

689
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,990
-But I never said...
-Exhibit A.

690
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,200
Oh, come on. That was a gift.

691
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,250
I suggest you let
your attorney do the talking.

692
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,420
Oh, no.

693
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,960
Back in my day, you had to
earn one of these babies.

694
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,250
Dad, what? I did not...

695
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,050
His best friend was
an alarm clock.

696
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,840
Mom.

697
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,510
He broke my arm.

698
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,050
No, I didn't!
It was my brother.

699
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,220
Objection, Your Honor.

700
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,680
Sustained.

701
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,310
We the jury find
the defendant...

702
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,810
A failure!

703
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,600
Tabitha, will you please
help me out?

704
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,980
Whoa!

705
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,400
Dad, the homework,
it's just too much.

706
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,570
-Whoa!
-Tabitha!

707
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,780
Time's up.

708
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,360
-Wait. No!
-Save me, Daddy! Save me!

709
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,750
Oh, man. That was crazy.

710
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,170
We overslept! We overslept?

711
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,880
-We overslept.
-Wake up, little halflings!

712
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,040
Wake up! What year is it?

713
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,840
Oh, no.

714
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,590
This is bad. No.

715
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,260
No! No.

716
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,590
Get up.

717
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,930
Get up. We got to go.

718
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,810
Come on.
We're gonna be late for... Oh!

719
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm gonna email it to you.

720
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,600
What's going on?

721
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,890
Ah, I forgot to set Wizzie
for daylight savings!

722
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,940
-What?!
-Daylight can't be saved, Tim.

723
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,230
Oh, I got to get the plant
and the bug we got to plant.

724
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,110
-Grab whatever. We got to go.
-Don't panic. Do not panic.

725
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,650
- Ow.
- Godspeed, boys.

726
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,780
Let's roll.

727
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,280
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa...!

728
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,080
Upsies.

729
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,540
-I need upsies...!
-Oh!

730
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,960
Get dressed.

731
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,340
What have you done to me?!

732
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,300
No, really?
What, are we going sailing?

733
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,470
Oh, no.
No, no, it's leaving.

734
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,140
Wait, no, no. Stop!

735
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,310
Stop, stop, stop. Come back!

736
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,470
Ahoy!

737
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,810
Come back!

738
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,020
Great, matey.

739
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,600
What are we gonna do now?

740
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,910
Oh, no!

741
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,340
Precious, my noble steed.

742
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,510
We must not be late
for our first day of school.

743
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,640
Oh, gross.

744
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,350
Huh?

745
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,680
Tallyho, Precious!

746
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,810
This pony hates me. Oh!

747
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,270
It's not that
she hates you, Tim.

748
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,860
She just doesn't respect you.

749
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,740
Go left! Go left!

750
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,700
I'm gonna go
where navigation says.

751
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,910
Turn left.

752
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,280
Thank you, navigation.

753
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,910
- Whoa!
- Turn right.

754
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,580
Sorry.

755
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,000
Turn left.
Proceed on the current route.

756
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,090
Yeehaw!

757
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,800
Recalculating.

758
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,630
Hold on to your holster.

759
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,920
Hyah!

760
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,760
Oh, no. It's Carol!

761
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,890
Don't answer it.

762
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,050
- Hi.
- Oh, Tim.

763
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,310
How's your bonding trip?

764
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,060
Uh... Whoa!

765
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,390
Whoa. Slow down.

766
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,190
How... is... your...

767
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,110
-bonding trip?
-Aah! Whoa.

768
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,730
You're here!

769
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,690
- Oh, no.
- I mean, um,

770
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,070
I wish you were here.

771
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,320
Oh, we miss you, too.

772
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,410
Don't we, girls?

773
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,870
We're, uh...

774
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,410
We're, uh, rebooting
our relationship

775
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,490
and, uh, restoring the
closeness that we once felt.

776
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,910
- That's so great.
- We've got to go.

777
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,120
Where are you?

778
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,580
-Uh, a hockey game.
-Hey!

779
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,170
He shoots, he scores!

780
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,460
He scores! He scores!

781
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
he scores!

782
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,670
-* Busted... *
-* Busted... *

783
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,840
* Busted. *

784
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,670
Is that the police?

785
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,090
Uh, no, not the police.

786
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,930
It's, uh...
it's a hockey alarm.

787
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,140
Faster, Tim.

788
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,890
I ain't going back
to the clink!

789
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,350
Now, I just wanted
to remind you

790
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,190
that Tabitha's pageant
is tomorrow night.

791
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,020
You have to be there.

792
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,770
Uh, I will be there
in one shape or another.

793
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,110
-You promise?
-I promise.

794
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,530
And what about Ted?

795
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,950
Happy holidays, coppers.

796
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,910
You're never gonna
take me alive, see?

797
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,200
Uh, he's busy.

798
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,950
What are you doing?
It's the cops.

799
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,450
Sorry, Officers.

800
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,370
Santa's got something
for everybody.

801
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,460
Sorry.

802
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,130
Recalculating.

803
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,300
Oh, my God! It's so real!

804
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,300
It's so real! It's so real!

805
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,760
Tim?

806
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,890
Recalculating.

807
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,060
Left! Left! Left!

808
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,350
Recalculating.

809
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,690
Right, right,
right, right, right!

810
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,110
Recalculating.

811
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,980
And now the moment
we've all waited for!

812
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,030
Proceed on the current route.

813
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,200
See, Tim?

814
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,700
Always trust... Holy...

815
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,120
Tim?

816
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,410
Uh, Carol?

817
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,120
You're breaking up.
I'm losing you.

818
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,580
No, honey, I can hear you fine.

819
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,830
-See you at the pageant.
Got to go. Bye. -Okay.

820
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,750
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

821
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,260
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

822
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,680
It's too real! It's too real!

823
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,890
Tallyho, Precious!

824
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,650
No, no, no, tally...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

825
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,860
- Tina!
- Tina!

826
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,030
Whoa!

827
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,530
Woo-hoo!

828
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,790
Whoa!

829
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,670
Tree!

830
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,670
You've arrived
at your destination.

831
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,090
And with a minute to spare.

832
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,840
Oh. Huh.

833
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,010
I'll send them a check.

834
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,430
Oh, that was fun.

835
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,890
You did it.

836
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,220
We did it.

837
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,970
I guess we did.

838
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,810
I was talking about
me and Precious.

839
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,810
-Oh.
-Isn't that right, baby?

840
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,020
Yeah. Right.

841
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,810
Get down!

842
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,040
Whoa.
This place even looks evil.

843
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,000
It's just a school.

844
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,750
You're overreacting.

845
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,000
And so is BabyCorp.

846
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,290
No, I'm telling you,

847
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,210
this school is stressing
Tabitha out.

848
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,960
Tabitha can handle it.

849
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,090
She's a real chip
off the old block.

850
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,090
-Wait, who's the block?
-I'm the block.

851
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,930
Well, you can't be the block.
I'm the block.

852
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,430
Then start acting like a block.

853
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,270
Wh-What does that mean?
I'm the block.

854
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,140
-I've always been the block.
-Yeah. Not even close.

855
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,600
All I do is block.

856
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,190
I wake up in the morning,
I block.

857
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,060
I go to sleep, blocking.

858
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,440
-I'm the block.
-Tim, enough.

859
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,030
-I'm the block.
-No, you're not! Stop it!

860
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,320
Shh.

861
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,700
Sweet.

862
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,160
Suckers.

863
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,120
Children only
beyond this point. -Hey.

864
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,200
No crying is permitted
in the separation zone.

865
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,790
Okay, looks like
we got to split up.

866
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,250
Good. I could use a break.

867
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,380
- Bye, Mom.
- All right, bye, honey.

868
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,960
There's Tabitha.

869
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,340
-I'll see you after school.
-Okay.

870
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,130
Apparently, there's no "A"

871
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,340
in "teamwork," either.

872
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,850
All right, let's boogie.

873
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,680
Not so fast.

874
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,230
I'm blue. You're yellow.

875
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,850
You're over there
in the choo-choo.

876
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,940
Aw. It's full of babies.

877
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,360
Is it? I didn't notice.

878
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,820
Just kidding. It's hilarious.

879
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,450
Uh, wait. Your tie's crooked.

880
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,910
Okay, Tim, focus.

881
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,660
We'll meet outside
Armstrong's office at 11:15.

882
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,660
We'll sneak in,
and we'll plant the bugs.

883
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,830
Are you focused?

884
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,040
Hey, what the...

885
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
-Oh, I am focused, all right.
-No, no.

886
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,420
I'm not yellow. I'm blue.

887
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,500
11:30. Stick to the plan.

888
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
11:15.

889
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,550
15. Got it.
The block is focused.

890
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,380
I'm blue! Aah! I'm blue.

891
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Don't you understand?
I'm blue!

892
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,350
Welcome, children.

893
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,720
Willkommen.

894
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,180
Bienvenue.

895
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,350
Annyeonghaseyo.

896
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,230
And buenos días.

897
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,190
Thank you for choosing
to be excellent.

898
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,730
Please don't touch me.

899
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,110
This is some
ridiculous mistake.

900
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,610
I'm blue! I'm blue!

901
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,360
* The wheels on the bus
go pi R-squared *

902
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,700
-* Circumference all around. *
-Yes.

903
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,200
Hello.

904
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,000
Uh, hello.

905
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,710
Nice plant.

906
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,210
This is
my emotional support plant.

907
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,040
Hi. I-I'm new here.

908
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,260
Said nihonium to the other
elements in the periodic table.

909
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,180
Ooh.

910
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,720
Okay.

911
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,390
Can't sit here.

912
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,220
Or here. Or there.

913
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,520
Seating position is
determined by class rank.

914
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,650
We can't possibly
include your data,

915
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,070
given that the rigor
of your previous school

916
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,980
is an unknown variable.

917
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,240
Ooh.

918
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,860
Sick burn, Nathan.

919
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,110
Ow.

920
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,240
Here.

921
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,410
You can take my seat.

922
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,870
I'm so proud of you.

923
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,870
I mean... thanks.

924
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,370
Okay...

925
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,250
Good morning.

926
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,670
Good morning, Dr. Armstrong!

927
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,050
Very warm welcome. Thank you.

928
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,380
Huh?

929
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
As you can see,
we've got a new colleague

930
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,220
joining us today.

931
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,720
-Ooh.
-Hello.

932
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,510
New colleague, why don't you
introduce yourself.

933
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,600
Uh, my name's Ti... um, Marcos.

934
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,020
-Hmm.
-Marcos Lightspeed.

935
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,600
Marcos Lightspeed.

936
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,190
Yeah. Colorful, characterful,
and I like it.

937
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,820
In any case...

938
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,440
...welcome, Marcos,
to Blue Unit. -

939
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,240
Our most advanced class.

940
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,070
Ooh, this is rarefied air

941
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,410
we're breathing.

942
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,330
Here at The Acorn Center,
we believe

943
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,410
that all competition is...

944
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,960
Healthy competition.

945
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,890
I'm trapped
in the dum-dum holding tank.

946
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,260
I'm having a panic attack.

947
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,680
There must be
a way out of here.

948
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,810
Something doesn't smell right.

949
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,940
Blueberry.

950
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,900
I have to get out of here.

951
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,150
Hi.

952
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,650
Don't look at me.

953
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,660
Okay.

954
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,950
And our first subject
today is...

955
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,080
No fractions, no fractions,
no fractions. Whoa!

956
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,830
Particle physics.

957
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes! What?

958
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,120
Yes!

959
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,630
Who knows which scientist

960
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,880
first theorized
that the universe has a limit

961
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,590
beyond which
the laws of physics break down?

962
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,930
Wow. Everybody seems to know.

963
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,430
Señor Lightspeed.

964
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,970
Um, Dr. Flam... baisley?

965
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,850
Oh, that's the wrong answer.

966
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,690
His brain sure doesn't move
at light speed.

967
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,480
- Uh, okay.
- I know, right?

968
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,360
-Anybody else?
-Right here.

969
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,780
Max Planck.

970
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,280
That's correct.

971
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,700
Tabitha has set the bar.

972
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,410
First one on the board.
Ding, ding, ding.

973
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,540
Way to go, Tabitha.

974
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,040
You're going down, Templeton.

975
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,500
Bring it on, Nathan.

976
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,710
Yeah, Tabitha. Get him.

977
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,250
Next subject.

978
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,880
Ancient Greek.

979
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,710
- Opa!
- Oprah!

980
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,880
Attention.

981
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,760
Attention, everyone.

982
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,470
Who wants to play Shawshank?

983
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,970
- No!
- Huh?

984
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,980
Who wants to go outside
and play?

985
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,100
Does that sound fun? Good.

986
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,060
Now, anybody have any ideas?

987
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,400
- No!
- Come on, people.

988
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,530
Think, think, think,
think, think.

989
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,780
We need to think
outside the box.

990
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,240
-Oh, oh, oh! Me, me! Oh!
-You, Bo-Peep.

991
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,320
We can build a hot-air balloon

992
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,280
out of Popsicle sticks
and bubble gum!

993
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,330
And how would it fly?

994
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,250
Pixie dust!

995
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,790
Get back in the box, Bo-Peep.

996
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,080
-All the way in?
-All the way in.

997
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,290
-Yay! -Ooh. Uh, can we get
in the box, too?

998
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,340
- Can we? Can we?
- Glue.

999
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,300
I like glue.

1000
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,510
Who doesn't?

1001
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,970
But we're trying
to brainstorm here.

1002
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,260
Glue's good.

1003
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,770
Think, think, think, think,
think, think... -

1004
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,930
...think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think!

1005
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,440
Bingo.

1006
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,770
Next subject.

1007
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,440
X is equal
to the derivative of...

1008
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,730
- Ooh, me!
- Itself.

1009
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,400
Kudos for Tabitha.

1010
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,900
Wow. You knew that?

1011
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,240
The world's leading producer
of bauxite is...

1012
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,740
- Oh!
- Australia.

1013
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,120
Once again,
Tabitha's on the board.

1014
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,370
Very good. -Yes, Tabitha!

1015
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,000
We got 15 minutes, people.

1016
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,170
The difference
in "try" and "triumph"

1017
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,960
is just a little oomph.

1018
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,090
- Oomph!
- Go big or go home.

1019
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,710
Okay. Going home.

1020
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,510
-Let's pick up the pace.
-No!

1021
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,550
Hand downs, Norma Rae.
This is my time.

1022
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,720
To be, or not to be?
Tabitha.

1023
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,310
To be. -That's correct.

1024
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,310
Can anyone tell me
the horsepower of a 302 engine?

1025
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,140
Uh, seven?

1026
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,900
- Oh, boy.
- Weak sauce, Nathan.

1027
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,480
That was weak.

1028
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,730
Tabitha, do you have
an idea about that?

1029
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,320
300 horsepower
with a four-barrel carb.

1030
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,610
Wow.

1031
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,490
Her dad must be a genius.

1032
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,030
On my signal, unleash heck.

1033
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,950
Fire!

1034
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,540
Yes!

1035
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,880
I found a cure!

1036
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,670
Yes! Yes! She did it!

1037
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,880
She did it.

1038
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,170
Marcos!

1039
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,470
I did it. I did it.

1040
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:00,270
Remember, your size doesn't
determine your strength.

1041
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,190
Well, so far,
it's Tabitha number one

1042
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,690
and everybody else last.

1043
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,410
Psst. Hey, Tabitha.

1044
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,660
You're really...

1045
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,290
-A geek. I know.
-No.

1046
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,200
You're amazing.

1047
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,540
Oh. Thanks, Marcos.

1048
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,040
You'll be singing
a different tune at rehearsal.

1049
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,130
The wrong tune.

1050
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,630
You're so funny.

1051
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,340
Hilarious!

1052
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,390
And yeah, Templeton,
don't be late.

1053
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,100
Late.

1054
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,220
- I'm late.
- Next subject.

1055
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,430
Yes!

1056
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,390
Just a little further.

1057
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,730
Glue!

1058
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,740
Excuse me.

1059
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,030
Yes, Marcos.

1060
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,860
Can I have a hall pass?
I have to go.

1061
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,410
Voilà. Feel free.

1062
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,080
Now what?

1063
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,870
Now what?

1064
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,500
Glue!

1065
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,370
Glue is bad!

1066
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,250
Glue.

1067
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,710
Glue is good.

1068
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,090
How to get to
the principal's office.

1069
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,590
Of course.

1070
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,510
You get sent
to the principal's office.

1071
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,020
Booyah!

1072
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,060
* I think it's very vital
to rock a rhyme... *

1073
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,110
* Here we go, it's tricky
to rock a rhyme *

1074
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,030
* To rock a rhyme that's right
on time, it's tricky *

1075
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,360
* It's tricky, tricky,
tricky, tricky *

1076
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,070
* It's tricky to rock a rhyme *

1077
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,620
* To rock a rhyme that's right
on time, it's tricky... *

1078
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,450
What's up, y'all?

1079
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,540
School is...

1080
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,080
stupid.

1081
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,830
Listen, you know,
I acknowledge your anger.

1082
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,630
It's, uh, very, uh, feisty,
but please sit down.

1083
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,340
Okay. Uh, no.

1084
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,130
Sitting is... stupid!

1085
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,630
- He's such a bad boy.
- Ooh.

1086
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,850
* It's tricky to rock a rhyme *

1087
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,470
* To rock a rhyme that's right
on time, it's tricky *

1088
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,980
-* How is it, D? *
-* It's tricky, tricky... *

1089
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,230
All right. I'm afraid you can't
disrupt class any longer.

1090
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,030
Oh, no. Are we gonna have
a talk in your office?

1091
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,650
No.

1092
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,820
- You are gonna have a time-out.
- The Box?

1093
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,820
He's going in the Box.

1094
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,330
No, the Box makes you crazy.

1095
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,830
The Box?

1096
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,500
* Sail away,
sail away, sail away *

1097
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,330
* Sail away, sail away *

1098
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,790
* Sail away... *

1099
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,050
Sayonara, Marcos.

1100
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,630
Your time-out begins now.

1101
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,010
Relax.

1102
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,180
Wait!

1103
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,260
Don't cry.

1104
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,180
There, there. All better.

1105
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,280
It's like they always say:

1106
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,160
If you want something
done right,

1107
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,870
you have to do it
without your brother!

1108
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,830
We meet again, doorknob.

1109
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,340
Hello.

1110
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,840
Welcome, welcome.

1111
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,760
Please come in. Entrez vous?

1112
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,220
You're here.

1113
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,760
Oh, yes. I...

1114
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,970
I was expecting you.

1115
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,890
I...

1116
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,230
I expected that you

1117
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,310
would be expecting me,
so there.

1118
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,860
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
I know why you're here,

1119
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,900
so, uh... so there.

1120
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,740
You do?

1121
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,030
Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.

1122
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,740
Have a seat, please.

1123
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,160
Thank you.

1124
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,870
-You know what you are?
-Mm?

1125
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:54,250
You are, if I may,
extremely intelligent.

1126
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,750
Go on.

1127
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,380
Uh, as a matter of fact,
I've been observing you.

1128
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,510
Spends time wisely. Check.

1129
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,170
Makes good use of
classroom materials. Check.

1130
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,760
Keeps hands to self. Check.

1131
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,300
Hey, forget
"works well with others."

1132
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,430
You make others
work well for you.

1133
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,850
That's literally the title
of the book I'm working on.

1134
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,100
No kidding.
You had no business

1135
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,230
being in Yellow Level, did you?

1136
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,610
-It was sabotage.
-Sabotage. Exactly.

1137
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,190
Jealousy, fear. Hey, I faced
the same obstacles.

1138
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,820
In fact, you know,
you remind me a lot of myself

1139
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,280
when I was your age,

1140
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,120
which is now.

1141
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,620
What?

1142
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,300
Surprise, surprise.

1143
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,800
What the frittata?

1144
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,920
Well put.

1145
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,390
He's a ba... You're a baby.

1146
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,970
I repeat, you're a baby.

1147
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,470
So surprised,
you said it twice.

1148
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,480
Unfortunately, people are, uh,
not ready for a...

1149
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,730
a baby in a position of power.

1150
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,270
Yet.

1151
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,990
Remind me to get the number
of your muttonchop guy.

1152
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,820
You know, I could use
somebody like you.

1153
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,780
With a superior intelligence
like my own.

1154
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,500
-Uh... really?
-Mmm.

1155
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,910
Somebody who can, uh...

1156
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,080
Mmm.

1157
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,500
Mmm. Yeah.

1158
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,250
Truly comprehend
what I'm trying to accomplish.

1159
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,010
-Well, you're looking at him.
-Bingo.

1160
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,220
Mmm. We have a secret level.

1161
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,880
Mmm.
For very special babies.

1162
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,390
Mmm. The best of the best.

1163
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,640
Ah. The elite.

1164
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
Beyond blue?

1165
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Oh, yeah. Way beyond.

1166
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,730
Way beyond. Ooh.

1167
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,850
Mmm. There's a meeting today...

1168
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,600
...after school.

1169
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,150
Babies only.

1170
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,030
We may be small, but we're
about to teach grown-ups

1171
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,400
a big lesson.

1172
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,700
Mmm. Lolly?

1173
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,030
Okay.

1174
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,580
Oh. Time for recess.

1175
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,080
Bye-bye.

1176
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,830
Sayonara....

1177
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,460
Well, I think that went well.

1178
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,380
- You're a baby.
- What?

1179
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,430
I repeat, you're a baby.

1180
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,640
Is he talking to me?
He better not be talking to me,

1181
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,140
because I'll... Armstrong?

1182
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,890
You're right, Connie.

1183
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,430
He's talking about Armstrong.

1184
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,230
I don't know what has
gotten into her. -

1185
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,900
But she's acting strange,
Dr. Federman. -

1186
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,150
Isn't it a bit early
for terrible twos?

1187
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,030
Is there terrible ones?
Is that a thing?

1188
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,570
Oh, piano-playing bunny,
you slay me.

1189
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,150
Okey dokey.

1190
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,490
We need some eyes on the prize,
visual confirmation here.

1191
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,040
Oh, Daddy.

1192
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,120
If I were there,
I'd pinch you so hard.

1193
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,000
* Sail away, sail away... *

1194
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,830
Your time-out has concluded.

1195
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,750
Sail away! What time is it?

1196
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,460
It is time for recess.

1197
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,510
I'm late, I'm late,
I'm late, I'm late. Come on.

1198
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,510
He'll understand, right?

1199
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,340
Okay.
Where is he? Where is he?

1200
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,720
Where is he? Uh...

1201
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,680
Oomph! Yeah, baby!

1202
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,270
No, not my bows.

1203
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,640
- But they're not your bows...
anymore. -

1204
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,650
Yep, where there's crying,
there's my brother.

1205
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,650
Psst. Here you go.

1206
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,240
Cool.

1207
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,330
Glue. Glue. Glue.

1208
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,000
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, blue.
-Whoa!

1209
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,790
Where do you think
youse going? You lost?

1210
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,790
Could you let me through,
please?

1211
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,250
No!

1212
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,960
So, what, did you flunk
coloring class, kid?

1213
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,590
Really, guy?

1214
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,300
Mmm, cherry.

1215
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,300
Go on.

1216
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,680
Blues on the other side.

1217
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,010
Let him through.

1218
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,140
Okay, he's cool.

1219
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,560
See? I'm cool.

1220
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,810
I'm cool.

1221
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,640
You failed me, Tim.

1222
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,100
I was desperate.

1223
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,810
I crawled.
I did things with glue

1224
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,230
that I'm not proud of,
but I made it.

1225
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,190
I made it all the way
to Armstrong's office,

1226
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,200
and then where's Tim?

1227
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,410
-I know. I...
-Where's Tim?

1228
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,160
-I tried to...
-Where's Tim?!

1229
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,030
I was in the Box, okay?

1230
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,280
- The Box?
- The Box?

1231
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,160
Glue.

1232
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,700
Yeah, that's right.

1233
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,960
The Box.

1234
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,330
Show a little respect.

1235
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,250
See, Tim, this is why
I work alone.

1236
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,840
I'll succeed in the mission.

1237
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,380
You can take the pony home.

1238
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,760
The only thing
you're ever gonna succeed at

1239
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
is being alone.

1240
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,010
-Fine.
-Fine!

1241
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,510
Fine!

1242
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,010
I like ponies.

1243
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,390
Aah! Thank you for sharing.

1244
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,020
You are blowing it, Templeton!

1245
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,190
Yeah, Templeton.

1246
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,610
I'm trying.

1247
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,280
Ugh! You always
come in a beat late.

1248
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,780
I'm sorry, Nathan.
I'm doing my best.

1249
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,700
Your best is going to keep me
out of going to Juilliard.

1250
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,660
-Yeah, Templeton.
-It's one, two, three

1251
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,080
- and one, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1252
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,580
And one, two, three

1253
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,380
and one, two, three
and one, two, three.

1254
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,710
-And one, two...
-Oh, come on!

1255
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,050
Are you kidding me?

1256
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,720
I just can't do it
right now, okay?

1257
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,180
I can't. I just can't.

1258
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,350
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Seriously?

1259
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,480
All right,
all right, all right.

1260
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,890
See you at the pageant
tomorrow.

1261
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,850
Beat it!

1262
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,650
Oh, Nathan,
Nathan, let me do it.

1263
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,030
Let me do it, Nathan.

1264
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,570
I want to sing the song.

1265
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,910
No.

1266
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,870
I want to see her fail.

1267
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,580
Oh.

1268
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,210
Pure genius.

1269
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,080
I can't wait.

1270
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,630
We'll see about that.

1271
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,590
Goodbye, children.

1272
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,760
Sayonara.

1273
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,090
Auf Wiedersehen.

1274
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,260
Adieu.

1275
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,220
Adios, niños.

1276
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,270
Oh, come on.

1277
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,270
Oh, my gosh.

1278
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:54,730
Stop what you're doing.

1279
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,110
I see a baby pony.

1280
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,490
I like ponies.

1281
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,780
Oh, over there!

1282
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,950
Yes!

1283
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,120
It's so cute!

1284
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,000
That's it? No hello?

1285
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,050
-Not even a "Hi, Mom"?
-What?

1286
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,920
Hi, Tabitha!

1287
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,840
Oh. Hi.

1288
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,220
What?
You never told me you had

1289
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,100
an older sister
who could drive.

1290
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,600
Uh, that's my mom.

1291
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,350
Tabitha, don't interrupt.

1292
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,440
-Yeah, I'm a new friend
of Tabitha's... -Hey, stop.

1293
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,480
Oh, really?

1294
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,310
I-I mean, we just met.

1295
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Well, what's your name,
new friend?

1296
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,440
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

1297
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,780
Marcos. Marcos Lightspeed.

1298
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,530
- Ow!
- Tina!

1299
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,990
What is with you?

1300
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,450
Cute kid.

1301
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,410
Well, I better get going
if I'm gonna walk those

1302
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:49,000
three and a half miles home...

1303
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,370
in the snow...

1304
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,000
without a jacket.

1305
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,840
Three and a half miles?

1306
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,670
Three and a half, six--
somewhere in there.

1307
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,050
Yeah, well, that TV dinner
is not gonna microwave itself.

1308
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,470
TV dinner?

1309
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,840
Yeah, I'm a latchkey kid,
so I eat whatever I want.

1310
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,890
Cartoons are my babysitter.

1311
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,100
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

1312
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,390
* Strangers in the night *

1313
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,900
* Exchanging glances *

1314
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,190
* Lovers... *

1315
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,690
What is this?

1316
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,030
Some kind of prank?

1317
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,360
Children can be so cruel.

1318
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,820
Hello.

1319
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,920
Whoa. This is exactly like
Bill Gates' rec room...

1320
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,430
but a little smaller.

1321
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,060
What is all this?

1322
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,360
Research and development?

1323
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,900
Product testing?

1324
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:06,990
Huh. Something tells me
this isn't day care.

1325
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:10,910
Boy, could I use
a spy camera right about now.

1326
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:14,460
* Sail away, sail away,
sail away. *

1327
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,000
Anyway...

1328
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,670
Aw.

1329
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,760
Now, aren't you a cutie
in that little karate outfit.

1330
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,350
Huh.

1331
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,270
Is this some kind
of a ninja boy band?

1332
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,110
Whoa...!

1333
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,110
Whoa!

1334
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,940
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1335
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,110
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!

1336
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,620
Whoa.

1337
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,620
I give up.

1338
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,370
Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai!

1339
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,290
Sayonara, baby!

1340
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,340
- Hey, there you are.
- Oh, hello!

1341
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,670
Thank you.

1342
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,460
I see that you've angered
my baby ninjas.

1343
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,880
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1344
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,630
Shoo. Shoo.

1345
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,840
What maniacal underground
fortress doesn't have ninjas?

1346
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,470
- Am I right?
- Impressive, huh?

1347
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,810
Pretty impressive.

1348
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,310
What do you think?
What do you think?

1349
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,430
I know tuition is pretty steep,

1350
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,560
but how do you afford all this?

1351
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,520
Oh, that's a good question.

1352
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,110
-I taught babies to code.
-No.

1353
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,110
Yes. And you know
what they say about having

1354
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,320
an infinite amount of monkeys
banging on typewriters?

1355
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,200
They will eventually
write Shakespeare?

1356
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,370
A-plus.
Oh, boy, you are smart.

1357
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:32,290
Or the most popular apps
that money can buy.

1358
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,370
Apps. They're writing apps.

1359
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,000
Cat Chat.

1360
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,330
Palm Doodle.

1361
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,000
Ooh, Find My Nose.

1362
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,420
Stock Crush.

1363
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,000
You did Stock Crush?

1364
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,670
I love Stock Crush.

1365
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:46,590
All us. But my next app...

1366
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,340
ooh, it's gonna change
the world.

1367
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,430
Forever.

1368
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,760
So why bother with a school?

1369
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,310
You could go public
and make millions.

1370
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,060
Oh.

1371
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,440
-Billions.
-Billions.

1372
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,520
Yeah, but some things are
more important than money.

1373
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,190
Please don't say "love."

1374
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,400
Mmm. Power.

1375
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,610
That's more like it.

1376
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,450
Wow. This is so amazing.

1377
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:13,200
First, the ride, and now
a-a full sit-down dinner.

1378
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,910
Wow. What a palace.

1379
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,330
-I mean, you have electricity?
-Well, yeah.

1380
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,500
Man, you guys
are beyond generous.

1381
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,540
You're welcome anytime.

1382
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,170
Tabitha, would you mind

1383
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,840
-setting the table?
-Okay, Mom.

1384
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,090
Really? You're just gonna
throw that right there, huh?

1385
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,890
Psst. Psst. Daddy.

1386
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,760
-Shh! It's Marcos.
-What are you doing here?

1387
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,350
-Where's Uncle Ted?
-What?

1388
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,390
He kicked me off the mission.

1389
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,350
He can't do that.

1390
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,390
Only I can do that.

1391
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:38,600
You're back on the mission.

1392
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,060
No need.
I have my own mission now.

1393
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,360
What? What could be more
important than my mission?

1394
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,570
Got to go. Lightspeed out.

1395
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,240
This is so great.

1396
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,820
Well, I hope you're hungry.

1397
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,530
Been so long since I've
used silverware.

1398
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,030
So, how'd you like
your first day?

1399
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,410
Kind of intense.

1400
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,410
Yeah. You'll get used to it.

1401
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,950
-Even that Nathan kid?
-Nathan.

1402
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,210
- Ugh. He's a mess.
- Yeah.

1403
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,420
-He is such a square.
-A square?

1404
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,420
Uh, yeah, you know,
like a dork.

1405
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,340
Dweeb. Nerdlet.
A real poindexter.

1406
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,880
Lame-o. Dorkus to the max.

1407
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,720
They used to call me.

1408
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,220
- You're weird.
- I am?

1409
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,260
Yeah, but in a good way.

1410
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,350
So, why is the pageant
stressing you out so much?

1411
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:20,480
I have to sing.

1412
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,690
-So what?
-I don't know.

1413
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:25,070
My whole family is
going to be there,

1414
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,230
including my dad.

1415
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,780
Oh.

1416
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,200
Right.

1417
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,280
You're embarrassed of him?

1418
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,370
No. No, it's not that.

1419
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,700
It's just, he's really good
at this kind of thing--

1420
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,500
being creative
and using your imagination--

1421
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,540
but it's hard for me.

1422
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,790
I just want him
to be proud of me.

1423
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,130
You know?

1424
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,130
Really?

1425
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,840
Well, yeah.

1426
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,970
Um, who are
these extra plates for?

1427
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,810
Mom and Dad.

1428
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,720
Hey, hey!
The key still works!

1429
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,270
You guys should really
change the locks.

1430
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,850
-Oh, you made it.
-Look who's here!

1431
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:03,650
Mom and Dad.

1432
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:04,810
Grandma! Grandpa!

1433
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,610
There she is.

1434
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,110
-Come here, my little
tabby cat. -Yay! You're here!

1435
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,190
-Look at how big you are.
-You're almost a teenager.

1436
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,610
Can you vote yet?

1437
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:12,860
Ten and a half
more years, Grandma.

1438
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,110
Daddy, they're gonna
recognize you.

1439
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,280
No, no. It's fine.

1440
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,200
I've got the glasses. See?

1441
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,660
- Selfie!
- How do you do it again?

1442
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,950
Bring out the baby.

1443
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,540
-Hide!
-Where are you hiding that baby?

1444
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,960
No. Just be cool. Be cool.

1445
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,500
- There she is.
- Hello.

1446
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,750
Hey, who's the new guy?

1447
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,670
-That's Marcos.
-I gotcha.

1448
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,260
Attention, babies. Bienvenue.

1449
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,010
Willkommen.

1450
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,390
Dobro pozhalovat'.

1451
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,140
And namaste.

1452
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,100
Uh, babies.

1453
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,430
Hey, hey.

1454
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,890
No more screen time.

1455
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,270
Listen.

1456
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,570
Believe it or not,
I used to be just like you.

1457
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,190
Yes. I even had parents.

1458
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,610
Mine were child psychologists

1459
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,120
who made me part
of an experiment.

1460
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,370
Really?

1461
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,040
They exposed me to 10,000 hours

1462
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,620
-of Mozart, language lessons
and public radio. -Huh. Wow.

1463
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,420
I hate public radio.

1464
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,960
It was at that point I realized
I was smarter than my parents.

1465
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,970
And with my first step,
I ran away from home.

1466
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,220
Why?

1467
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,050
They pushed me around.

1468
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,220
I got told what to do
all the time.

1469
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,440
But a single word
changed my life.

1470
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,060
"No." Say it.

1471
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,400
No!

1472
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,400
-Take a nap.
-Nyet!

1473
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,320
-Put on your coat.
-Nein!

1474
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,690
-Eat your vegetables.
-Nahii!

1475
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,990
Are you gonna let grown-ups
push you around?

1476
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,370
No, no! No, no, no!
No, no! No, no, no!

1477
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,740
-Are you?
-Good God, no.

1478
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,080
That's right.

1479
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,080
Why do parents get to be
in charge, anyway?

1480
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,500
They had their chance,
and what did we get?

1481
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,670
Pollution, politics, wars.

1482
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,050
Ooh.

1483
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,090
Not "ooh." "Boo."

1484
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,720
Boo!

1485
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,100
The only thing holding us back
is them,

1486
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,760
but not anymore.

1487
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:06,690
The moment that we've worked
so hard for is almost here.

1488
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,850
B-Day.

1489
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:09,100
-B-Day?
-B-Day.

1490
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,230
-I'm this many.
-I'm this many.

1491
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,610
No, no, it's not...
it's not your birthday.

1492
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,490
It's the beginning
of the baby revolution.

1493
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,320
Yay, yay.

1494
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,990
And there'll be cake.
Cake for everybody.

1495
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:23,790
Cake! Cake!
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

1496
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,410
No more rules.

1497
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,290
Oh là là!

1498
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,040
No more parents.

1499
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,290
Uh-oh.

1500
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,460
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

1501
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,960
Sayonara, Mama and Papa!

1502
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,010
Oh, this is bad.

1503
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,920
All right, pep rally's over.

1504
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,340
Your-your parents
are gonna pick you up.

1505
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,970
This is my life's work.

1506
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,930
Oh, yes, 17 long months.

1507
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,560
To... no more parents.

1508
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,230
Mmm.

1509
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,690
Cheers to the revolution.

1510
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,360
No. Nope. Nope.

1511
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,240
- No. Oh, that's a keeper.
- Oh, Tina.

1512
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,360
Oh, it's so cute.
What's the app called?

1513
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,820
-It's called QT Snap.
-Oh.

1514
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,780
-Show me how to download that.
-Everyone has it.

1515
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,830
So, Marcos... Lightspeed?

1516
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,450
-Is that what you said?
-Mm-hmm.

1517
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,290
Sounds like a cartoon name.

1518
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,330
It really does.

1519
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,290
Well, my parents,
they're a little wacky, so...

1520
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,670
Huh. It's like I know you
from somewhere.

1521
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,050
I don't think so.

1522
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,720
-That is a keeper, too.
-Hey. Hey.

1523
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,760
-Doesn't he look familiar?
-I don't think I do.

1524
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,220
Yeah, he looks just like Tim.

1525
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,850
Yeah. You look like Tim.

1526
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,060
Hmm? -Huh?

1527
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,600
Except Tim didn't wear glasses.

1528
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,770
Oh, that's right.

1529
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,270
Huh. Well, how about that.

1530
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,860
Hey, where is Tim, anyway?

1531
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,690
Tim and Ted are on a trip.

1532
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,910
- Together?
- They're bonding.

1533
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,990
-Well, that's about time.
-Yeah.

1534
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,200
I just hope Tim's back
in time for the pageant.

1535
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,660
Uh, why...
why wouldn't he be there?

1536
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,710
- Tim Time.
- Tim Time.

1537
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,750
Oh.

1538
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:54,880
What's-what's Tim Time?

1539
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,380
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1540
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:00,340
Well, Marcos, Tim Time
is like a black hole

1541
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:04,800
where things like reality
and being on time get lost.

1542
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,260
Oh.

1543
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,060
Tabitha's father has
a very active imagination.

1544
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,810
Which is a good thing.

1545
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,520
Yeah, that's a...
I'd say that's a good thing.

1546
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,900
Oh, remember when he said our
boss was trying to kidnap us?

1547
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,440
He did?

1548
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,030
Or that his baby
brother could walk and talk

1549
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,700
but only when
we weren't looking.

1550
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,830
Wow. Turn around.

1551
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,040
That's so Dad.

1552
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,750
You know, Ted was
quite a handful himself.

1553
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,080
- Oh, he could be very...
- Uptight.

1554
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,880
Mm. Yes. High-strung.

1555
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,300
Oh. Remember the time
he sued us?

1556
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,050
Teenagers. Ugh.

1557
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,300
He really looked up
to his big brother, though.

1558
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,470
- He did?
- Oh, yeah.

1559
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,310
He wouldn't leave him alone.

1560
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,930
Everything Tim did,
Teddy wanted to do.

1561
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

1562
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,600
Tagalong Teddy, we called him.

1563
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,770
- Well, not to his face.
- No, no.

1564
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,020
Not to his face.
He was very litigious.

1565
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,280
But you know what?
Your dad didn't mind.

1566
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,320
He was so proud
of his little brother.

1567
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,160
-Oh, yeah.
-He loved showing him off.

1568
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,870
Those guys did
everything together.

1569
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,950
They were best friends.

1570
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,700
Just like you and me.

1571
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,460
Right, Tina?

1572
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,790
Best friends forever.

1573
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,120
Tickle monster!

1574
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,290
That's so sweet.

1575
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,470
And this is my closet.

1576
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,300
- Oh, cool closet.
- And this is my bed.

1577
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,260
And this is my fish.

1578
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:35,020
-Hey, want to see something
really, really cool? -Sure.

1579
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,980
I made this vocalizer
for Dr. Hawking.

1580
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,770
Hey, my old...

1581
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,730
-What did you do?!
-Check this out.

1582
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,900
Say hello, Dr. Hawking.

1583
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,820
Hell-l-l-l-l...

1584
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,490
Um, he has performance anxiety.

1585
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:51,910
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1586
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,580
Oh, this is Lamb Lamb.

1587
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,120
Hey, Lamb Lamb.

1588
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,830
That's my galaxy model
right up there on my shelf.

1589
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,040
My scientist of the week award.

1590
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,920
-Wow.
-My geode rock collection.

1591
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,510
And my telescope.

1592
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,670
Sweet.

1593
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,010
-Hey, cool guitar.
-Yeah.

1594
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,050
That's my dad's.

1595
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,930
Cool dad.

1596
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,220
Are you okay?

1597
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,520
Yeah, I'm a lot taller
in my mind.

1598
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,730
Hey, if you want,
I can help you with your song.

1599
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,020
No, you can't.

1600
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,690
-Your ears will bleed.
-Oh, please.

1601
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,360
It'll be fun.

1602
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,940
How about this one?
It's a classic.

1603
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,030
Do we have to?

1604
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:29,360
Come on. Let's try.

1605
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:32,120
Okay.

1606
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,740
It's not gonna be good, though.

1607
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:35,910
No judgment.

1608
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:37,460
We're just having fun.

1609
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,460
* There's no place like home *

1610
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,630
* For the holidays *

1611
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,590
Please stop.

1612
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,220
-No, stop. Aah...!
-* 'Cause no matter *

1613
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,890
* How far away you roam... *

1614
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,060
Good... try.

1615
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,730
Ugh! I just get so nervous.

1616
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:04,730
That's okay.

1617
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,240
Listen, all you got to do

1618
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,240
is imagine that
you're inside the song.

1619
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,080
Everything in the lyrics
is actually happening to you.

1620
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,250
And you can see the notes.

1621
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,800
* Well, if you want
to sing out, sing out *

1622
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,380
* And if you want
to be free, be free *

1623
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,760
-Wow. Whoa! -* 'Cause there's
a million things to be *

1624
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,430
-* You know that there are *
-Whoa. Marcos, wait up.

1625
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,180
Come on.

1626
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,430
* And if you want to sing
high, sing high * -

1627
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,440
-That's a little too high.
-* And if you want *

1628
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:43,440
-* To sing low, sing low *
-Whoa.

1629
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,110
I got you.

1630
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,360
* 'Cause there's a million
ways to go * -

1631
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,110
* You know that there are *

1632
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,530
OMG, that's a lot.

1633
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,490
* Uh-huh, it's easy *

1634
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,990
* Uh-huh *

1635
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,620
* You only need to try *

1636
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,540
* You can sing what you want *

1637
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,170
Whoo! Yeah, this is fun!

1638
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,380
* The opportunity's yours *

1639
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,470
* And if you do it your way *

1640
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,800
Whoa.

1641
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,140
* You can do it today *

1642
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,020
Marcos, wait. Where are you?

1643
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,640
Come on. You can do it.

1644
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:24,520
I can't. I can't.

1645
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,990
Now go for it.

1646
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,830
* Ah-ah-ah *

1647
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,620
Whoa.

1648
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,540
Hey.

1649
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:49,630
* It's easy *

1650
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,050
* Ah-ah-ah *

1651
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,680
* You only need to try *

1652
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,430
All right. My turn.

1653
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,390
Here we go. It's all you.

1654
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:01,350
* Well, if I want
to sing out, sing out *

1655
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,060
-* Sing out *
-Yes, let it out.

1656
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,980
* And if I want
to be free, be free *

1657
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,350
* Be free *

1658
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,570
* 'Cause there's
a million things to be *

1659
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,940
* I know that there are,
I know that there are *

1660
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,400
-* I know that there are *
-* You know that there are *

1661
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,360
-* I know that there are... *
-* You know that there are... *

1662
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:19,950
-* I know that there are *
-* You know that there are *

1663
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,080
* I know that there are. *

1664
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,130
Wow. That was so great.

1665
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,670
No, you were so great.

1666
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:32,840
Thanks, Marcos.

1667
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,260
What?

1668
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,720
-Oh, that's a keeper.
-Oh, they can see us.

1669
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,930
-They can see us.
-Aw.

1670
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,220
Guys, come on.

1671
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,390
Stop. No, do it. Do it.

1672
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,350
Oh, no.

1673
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,640
Parents, right?

1674
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,900
- Bye, Templeton family!
- Bye-bye.

1675
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,560
-Bye, Marcos.
-Lightspeed.

1676
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:49,610
Weird kid.

1677
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,320
Yeah, I don't like him.

1678
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,320
* Catch my eye *

1679
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:59,780
* Take my hand *

1680
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,290
* This bond is tighter
than we *

1681
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:04,000
You go get 'em, Tabitha.

1682
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,160
* Ever planned *

1683
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:09,040
* Give me courage *

1684
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,670
* So I can land... *

1685
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,250
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up,

1686
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,760
pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up,

1687
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,920
pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up. Choo-choo!

1688
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,260
Don't they understand
it's the fate of the world?

1689
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,350
I've been on hold forever!

1690
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,430
All operators
are currently napping.

1691
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,970
I've been on hold so long
I got a tooth growing in.

1692
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,440
Back in my day, we wrote memos.

1693
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,060
That's cute and old-timey.

1694
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,440
I weep for the future.

1695
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,940
Do you want to talk about your
feelings now while I'm on hold?

1696
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,110
I can give you 20 minutes.

1697
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,400
No.

1698
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:39,030
Let's get to the nut,
the nugget.

1699
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,530
What are you afraid of?

1700
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,990
Sharks, getting shot
in the head with an arrow,

1701
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,410
and... the IRS.

1702
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,950
-That's it.
-There you go.

1703
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,460
Was that so hard?
Baby steps.

1704
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,460
Now, what about being lonely?

1705
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,330
-I'm not lonely.
-Mm-hmm.

1706
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,800
I'm just... alone.

1707
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,300
There's a difference.

1708
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,970
I think it's time
you read your file. -

1709
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,590
-Ah-ah-ah-ah.
-Just give me.

1710
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,010
Whoa. This is it?

1711
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:02,510
It's so thin.

1712
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,390
Dear Boss Baby,

1713
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:06,020
I promise you this:

1714
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,730
Every morning when
you wake up, I will be there.

1715
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,480
Every night at dinner,
I will be there.

1716
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,900
Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning,

1717
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,400
I will be there.

1718
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,820
Year after year after year.

1719
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:23,780
And you and I
will always be brothers.

1720
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,700
Always.

1721
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,500
Makes me want to make
a sad face.

1722
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:35,500
We were just kids.

1723
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,090
We didn't know anything
about the real world.

1724
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,630
And eventually,
you have to grow up.

1725
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,890
Just because you grow up,
it doesn't mean

1726
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,430
you have to grow apart.

1727
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:47,100
I don't know.
Maybe it's already too late.

1728
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,100
Hey.

1729
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,350
Sorry I'm late.

1730
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,940
Daddy!

1731
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,150
Daddy, Daddy.

1732
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,400
What's going on?

1733
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,900
Uncle Ted really misses you.

1734
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,280
Isn't that nice?

1735
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,870
So, hey, uh, what you doing?

1736
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,330
Oh, I was, uh...

1737
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:08,580
I don't know,
I was just working on this.

1738
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:15,630
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said at recess.

1739
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,250
What happens on the playground
stays on the playground.

1740
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,170
I was just worried
about Tabitha, you know?

1741
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,550
She's your daughter. I get it.

1742
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,260
This whole time,
I was thinking about

1743
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,640
what I wanted
and not what she needed.

1744
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,810
I think I finally got this
parenting thing figured out.

1745
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:28,970
Gold star for you, Daddy.

1746
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,640
-Keep it up, Pops.
-Yeah, well, about that.

1747
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,770
Armstrong wants to get rid
of parents somehow.

1748
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,110
-Sorry, what? -He's planning
a baby revolution.

1749
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,650
Ugh, come on.

1750
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:39,900
Just when I got good
at this whole parenting thing.

1751
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,400
We got to stop him.

1752
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,990
-Not we.
-You?

1753
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,360
Neither one of us.

1754
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,030
-BabyCorp is taking it
from here. -Ah.

1755
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:48,200
So, what, they're gonna send in
the Baby SEALS or something?

1756
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,740
-Looks like it.
-So you'll, um...

1757
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:52,120
you'll be headed back
to your office.

1758
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,420
Uh, yeah.
Well, keep in touch, Tim.

1759
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,250
Hello? BabyCorp?

1760
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,250
Thank goodness, BabyCorp.
Well, BabyCo...

1761
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,510
Wha-What? What are you saying,

1762
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,510
there's not enough evidence,
BabyCorp? I...

1763
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,340
-Uh-oh. -So you're not
gonna do anything?

1764
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,760
But, BabyCorp, I...

1765
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,470
Ugh. Well, then
we'll take care of it.

1766
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,260
You know what, BabyCorp?

1767
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,680
I quit!

1768
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,810
What a bunch of
diaper sniffers.

1769
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,770
Looks like we have to stop
Armstrong ourselves.

1770
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,360
We're going rogue.
I like it.

1771
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,030
-So the mission's back on?
-Yeah.

1772
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:23,820
If you two can put up with
each other a little longer.

1773
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,120
I suppose I can live with that.
Tim?

1774
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,120
I think that's doable.

1775
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,120
Yay!

1776
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,580
Forced together again.

1777
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,370
It's 8:45 p.m.

1778
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,460
Okay. Our clock is ticking.

1779
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,590
We have to stop Armstrong
before the formula wears off.

1780
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,010
Working as a team,
we will strike at the pageant.

1781
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,300
Go, Tina.

1782
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,630
Now, this top secret
document...

1783
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,140
Sweetie, it's the program.

1784
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,470
This top secret program reveals

1785
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,470
that Armstrong is scheduled
to address the audience,

1786
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,560
which he will do right here
at the very end.

1787
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,190
We need someone backstage.
Tim, that's you.

1788
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,860
How am I gonna get backstage
if I'm not in the pageant?

1789
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,730
My people will
take care of that.

1790
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:04,990
-Ah!
-Thank you.

1791
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:06,150
Thank you.

1792
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,240
-No!
-Great.

1793
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,320
And... go.

1794
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,780
Glue.

1795
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,000
There, there. All better.

1796
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,620
Awesome.

1797
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:20,090
Now, I'll be your eyes
and your ears in the audience.

1798
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,000
I can't let Mommy see me talk,

1799
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,920
or she's gonna start
squealing and hugging me,

1800
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,670
but these little doodads
will let you

1801
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,510
understand my baby talk.

1802
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,180
It's called a GAGA device.

1803
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,550
-Aw, that's cute.
-Check it out.

1804
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,100
Can you hear me, Daddy?

1805
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,350
Also cute.

1806
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,430
Meanwhile,
with my new purple status,

1807
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,480
I can stay close to Armstrong.

1808
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,520
Um, that's-that's an eyebrow.

1809
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,520
-Oh. Sorry.
-Uh, no, that's, uh...

1810
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:44,280
When the moment is right,

1811
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,900
I'll implant a device.

1812
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,400
-Got it.
-Got what?

1813
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,610
I mean, you've got this.

1814
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,660
Go get 'em, tiger.

1815
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,620
Oh, thank you, parents.

1816
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,040
Thank you. There's the...

1817
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,040
There's the old enthusiasm
I like to see.

1818
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,420
This will
allow me to control his suit.

1819
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:01,880
I can make Muttonchops
do whatever I want.

1820
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,170
I can make him dance.

1821
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,880
I can make him prance.

1822
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,720
-Hey, no, no, no, no.
-Including exposing himself

1823
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,550
to the audience.

1824
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:14,350
Every parent
will pull out their phone.

1825
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,730
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!

1826
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,350
The photos will spread
like a diaper rash.

1827
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,230
Cut to our pizza party.

1828
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,190
Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof!

1829
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,400
Questions?

1830
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,610
After Tabitha sings
her solo, right?

1831
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,110
After Tabitha sings.

1832
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,780
Now we just sit back, relax
and enjoy the show.

1833
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,080
Welcome, parents,
to our holiday pageant.

1834
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,580
Remember, flash photography
in the auditorium

1835
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:42,250
is absolutely okay.

1836
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:45,050
Take a picture. Show your kids
that you love 'em.

1837
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:46,590
Yippee!

1838
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,960
Come on, Tim.

1839
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:50,260
You promised you'd be here.

1840
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,760
Oh, sorry. This seat is taken.

1841
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,720
- Yep. Sorry.
- Oh, no.

1842
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,970
So sorry. I... Sorry.

1843
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,100
Sorry! I am so sorry.

1844
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,440
Uncle Teddy,
are you in position?

1845
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,810
The baby's in the cradle.

1846
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:04,480
- The baby's in the cradle.
- Mmm.

1847
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,110
Papa Bear, can you read me?

1848
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,740
The flake has landed.

1849
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,820
Places! Places, everybody!

1850
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,200
-Here we go. Here we go.
-Oh, my gosh.

1851
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,120
- It's starting. It's starting.
- Finally.

1852
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,700
It's starting. It's starting.

1853
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:17,990
Yay!

1854
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,120
-You're a big pageant guy, huh?
-No, no, no.

1855
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,670
I'm not talking about the show.
I'm talking about B-Day.

1856
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,880
B-Day?

1857
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,250
Oh, yeah. It's already
in the parents' phones.

1858
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,800
I taught babies to code.

1859
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,510
Apps. They're writing apps.

1860
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,720
But my next app...

1861
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,310
ooh, it's gonna change
the world forever.

1862
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:43,980
QT Snap is the app that's going
to change the world forever?

1863
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,980
Forever starts today.

1864
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,030
Uh, cool.

1865
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,660
Aw.

1866
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,200
* It's wintertime *

1867
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,830
* It's the best time of year *

1868
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,750
* But due to ice caps melting *

1869
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,830
* Global warming's here *

1870
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,670
* It feels like summer *

1871
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,670
* The snow has disappeared *

1872
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,340
* It's all our parents' fault *

1873
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,260
-* So we're all doomed *
-TIM: * All, uh... *

1874
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,720
* Doomed. *

1875
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,340
This is kind of dark.

1876
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,680
Did the kids just say
we're doomed?

1877
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,680
What the heck are we watching?

1878
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,520
Their brains are
turning to mush.

1879
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,060
Months of hypnotic research
embedded

1880
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,900
in the most user-friendly
photo app ever made.

1881
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,520
Ooh.

1882
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,610
Now all we need to do
is sit back, relax

1883
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,360
and enjoy the show.

1884
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,740
- Hey!
- Right.

1885
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,900
I'll be right back.
We're, uh...

1886
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:36,570
- Hey!
- ...out of Dundle Floofers.

1887
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:37,950
Mmm.

1888
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,040
Diwali!

1889
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,540
Las Posadas!

1890
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,040
Agnostic!

1891
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,590
And Hanukkah!

1892
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,920
Your son is so talented.

1893
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:56,220
-Oh, so is yours.
-Liars.

1894
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,720
Tina, come in.
B-Day is happening now.

1895
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,260
It's all in the phones.

1896
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:03,270
Armstrong is using an app
to brainwash the parents.

1897
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,310
Gasp.

1898
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:07,560
We have to stop the show.

1899
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,150
Okay, okay. Uh, there's a...

1900
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,690
there's a big old
no-touchy switch backstage.

1901
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,740
Daddy,
we have to pull the plug.

1902
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,990
Daddy, come in.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,

1903
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,410
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

1904
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,370
Ugh. He's not responding.

1905
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,700
Of course not.

1906
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,870
-I'll do it myself.
-Stop!

1907
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,750
Theater kids only.

1908
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,080
Oh, come on, nativity!

1909
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:30,460
Look holier!

1910
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,920
Hey, Tabitha.

1911
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,840
Don't you worry, okay?

1912
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,760
You're gonna be great.

1913
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,060
Thanks, Marcos.
And thanks for all your help.

1914
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,180
Anytime.

1915
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,270
I feel like you really
understand me.

1916
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,940
I'm so excited.

1917
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:50,730
I can't wait to see the look
on my dad's face when I sing.

1918
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,610
Hey! You're on, Templeton!

1919
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,940
Wish me luck.

1920
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:56,360
And break a leg.

1921
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,900
Or two, for that matter.

1922
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:01,530
* We're in this together *

1923
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,120
* We live in harmony... *

1924
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,370
Psst.

1925
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,460
Tim!

1926
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,710
Is that the baby Jesus?

1927
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:17,800
* We have to shut down
the pageant. *

1928
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,720
-Yeah!
-What? No. Why?

1929
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,140
Armstrong's turning
the parents into zombies

1930
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,850
so they'll do
whatever he wants.

1931
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,970
What? What are you doing? No!

1932
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,770
Tabitha's on next.

1933
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,770
You'd risk
the future of the world

1934
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:32,810
-to see your daughter sing?
-Yes!

1935
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,900
-I have to be there for her.
-Look who's worried about

1936
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,530
showing up for things
all of a sudden.

1937
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,150
What's that supposed to mean?

1938
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,820
You didn't even come
to my graduation.

1939
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,280
Ow! Which one?

1940
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,740
Business school, law school.
None of them.

1941
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,490
You didn't even come
to my wedding.

1942
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,250
-Which one?
-I only had one!

1943
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:48,910
We had a deal, Tim.

1944
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,830
You promised
you'd be there always.

1945
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,420
Whoa. Where did you...

1946
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,050
Breach of contract!

1947
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,840
Whoa.

1948
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,180
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1949
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,590
How do you do there, fellas?

1950
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,560
Nothing's gonna ruin my B-Day.

1951
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,140
Not even you.

1952
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,020
-Oh, busted.
-Yeah, it was obvious

1953
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,640
from the very, very beginning

1954
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:14,310
that you two were
working together.

1955
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,730
What gave us away?

1956
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:18,030
Well, I'd say the bickering,

1957
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,860
the, uh, petty disputes,

1958
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,530
the jealousy.

1959
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,700
You know, you two are brothers
in every single way.

1960
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,700
Off to the Box they go.

1961
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,750
What? No.
Not the Box. Not now.

1962
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:32,370
Please.

1963
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,380
Aw, it's just... it's too bad
that you're never gonna

1964
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,540
have a chance to reboot
your relationship and...

1965
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,510
-No!
-...and restore the closeness

1966
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:39,880
that you once felt.

1967
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,550
-Sorry about that.
-No.

1968
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,800
-No, no, no, no. No!
-Adios, Marcos.

1969
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,890
* Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh... *

1970
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,770
Oh, look, look. There she is.

1971
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:49,930
There's our little angel.

1972
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,850
-Oh! Tabby's in the tree.
-Ah! Oh!

1973
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,560
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *

1974
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:57,360
* Ooh-ooh-ooh... *

1975
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,780
You had one job to do.

1976
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,780
One job.

1977
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,790
-Oh, no.
-The fountain.

1978
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,450
It's flooding the room.

1979
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,830
This isn't a time-out.

1980
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,250
It's game over.

1981
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,330
* Ooh-ooh *

1982
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,670
* Ooh-ooh-ooh *

1983
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,430
Psst.

1984
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:28,050
It's one, two, three
and one, two, three.

1985
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,940
* Catch my eye *

1986
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,110
* Take my hand *

1987
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:50,450
* This bond is tighter
than we ever planned *

1988
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:52,830
* Give me courage *

1989
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,290
* So I can land *

1990
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:58,840
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

1991
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,920
* So together we stand *

1992
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,840
* Laugh and cry with me *

1993
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,510
* Fly that high with me *

1994
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,680
* See the sunset
and the sunrise * -

1995
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,350
-* The world looks so good
through our eyes * -Wow.

1996
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:19,360
* Like the moon
and stars at night *

1997
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,030
You're right. I blew it.

1998
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,150
I ruined the mission.

1999
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,070
And I'm a terrible father.

2000
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,080
Hey, you did sort of
ruin the mission.

2001
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,700
But you're a great dad.

2002
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,160
No, I'm not.

2003
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,790
I could never do your job.

2004
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,370
I mean, you work
around the clock,

2005
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:38,080
you can't even quit
if you wanted to,

2006
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,710
and you don't even get paid.

2007
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,090
Frankly, I don't see
how that's legal.

2008
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:44,260
I was always jealous of you.

2009
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,720
I wanted to be successful,
too, you know.

2010
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,050
Sure, Tim.

2011
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,430
I made a lot of money...

2012
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,560
but you made a family.

2013
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,680
The truth is...

2014
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,640
it's lonely at the top.

2015
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,690
* Reach with me *

2016
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:07,030
* See the sky *

2017
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:11,780
* I'll always be here
for the rest of your life *

2018
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,790
* Sail that ocean *

2019
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:17,210
* Find that sand *

2020
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,790
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2021
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:24,840
* So together we stand *

2022
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,180
You know, I'm... I'm sorry we
don't see each other anymore.

2023
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,220
A very wise person
once told me,

2024
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:38,060
just because you grow up

2025
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,060
doesn't mean
you have to grow apart.

2026
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,600
-Was it Tina?
-Oh, yeah.

2027
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:44,570
Oh, it is crazy
how smart she is.

2028
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,820
It's like she looks
right into your soul.

2029
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,740
I'm sorry that I missed
your graduations.

2030
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,450
I'm sorry I missed
your one wedding.

2031
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:55,740
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you.

2032
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:58,660
* Side by side *

2033
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,330
* Hand in hand *

2034
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:06,210
* We speak a language
no one else can understand *

2035
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,170
* Hear those cheers *

2036
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:11,470
* Strike up the band *

2037
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:15,970
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2038
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:23,190
* So together we stand. *

2039
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:45,840
Oh, Tabitha.

2040
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,300
Gramps?

2041
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,010
Nana? Mom?

2042
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,170
Oh, no!

2043
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,090
Oh, my gosh, Tabitha.

2044
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:53,970
You did such a great job.

2045
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,220
Well, that's just
horribly rude of you all.

2046
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,560
Come on, everybody.

2047
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,440
Uh, how about
a standing ovation?

2048
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,400
Very good.

2049
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,020
They're zombies!

2050
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,730
We did it!

2051
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:12,650
The baby revolution has begun.

2052
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,990
No more need for costumes.

2053
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,120
Who wants cake?

2054
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,500
Oh, my gosh.

2055
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,080
Happy B-Day, everybody.

2056
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,130
Daddy, Uncle Ted.

2057
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,710
Come in. Where are you?

2058
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,060
Here you go, sis.

2059
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,600
Now, I already used this,
so I know it's safe.

2060
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,390
Thanks.

2061
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,310
Wait. Are you t-talking?

2062
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,320
I know.
It's pretty weird, isn't it?

2063
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,570
Oh, my gosh, you're talking!

2064
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,030
It's an emergency.

2065
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,360
I'm on a supersecret mission
from BabyCorp.

2066
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:59,780
You mean Dad's stories
are true?

2067
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,700
That's what the suit says.

2068
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,910
How do I look?

2069
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,330
No way!

2070
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:06,370
Now, I can't get ahold
of Dad or Uncle Ted,

2071
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,290
so I need your help, big sis.

2072
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,920
Wait, wait.
Dad's here?

2073
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,420
They've been here
the whole time.

2074
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,380
-Where? -I don't have
much time to explain,

2075
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,760
but Dr. Armstrong is a baby.

2076
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,720
A very bad, bad baby.

2077
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,600
Soon, the world is
gonna be our playground.

2078
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,060
Whee! -

2079
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,810
Now we can make parents
do whatever we want.

2080
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:29,940
Awesome! Yeah!

2081
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,900
No more rules.

2082
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,610
Sayonara, Mama and Papa.

2083
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,950
Yeah.

2084
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,410
-Mom?
-Dad?

2085
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:40,410
Grandpa?

2086
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,120
Whoa. Are you kidding me?

2087
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,250
We need to shut it down
before it goes global.

2088
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,410
- Yeah.
- What are we gonna do?

2089
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,670
Okay, we need to find
the big whatchamacallit

2090
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,290
that controls
the parents' phones.

2091
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,840
-The server.
-Yes. Yes.

2092
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,010
Is there a big one
of those whatsits at school?

2093
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,590
Uh, let's see.

2094
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,760
Well, servers get really hot,
so you need air ducts.

2095
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,100
Now you're thinking!

2096
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,310
Which intersect at the acorn!

2097
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:04,640
-A-plus!
-Come on.

2098
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,100
This way.

2099
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,350
Opportunity knocks.

2100
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,940
First, we need to make
a quick pit stop.

2101
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:14,280
Your time has concluded.

2102
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,440
It looks like this is it, Tim.

2103
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,780
Well, hey, at least we have

2104
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,450
these last final
precious moments together.

2105
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,870
Precious. Precious!

2106
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,130
Oh, right. Precious. Precious!

2107
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,990
That's my girl.

2108
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,160
Thank you.

2109
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,410
Tina?

2110
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,830
Tina, Tina, come in.
It's Daddy.

2111
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:12,210
Daddy! Listen, we have
to shut down the server.

2112
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,000
-It's in the acorn.
-Whoa.

2113
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,670
This is so weird.

2114
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,960
I call shotgun.

2115
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,050
Quick, to the acorn!

2116
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,630
Hyah!

2117
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,340
Yeehaw!

2118
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:24,180
Hold on to your chaps, pal.

2119
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,260
Whoa!

2120
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,900
Oh, no!

2121
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,020
Glue!

2122
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:38,530
Yah! Pixie dust! Aha.

2123
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:39,940
Yeah, baby. -Yes.

2124
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,200
Wha...?

2125
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:51,410
Where'd I go?

2126
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,540
-Whoa!
-I like your pajamas.

2127
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,420
Where are you going?

2128
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,880
Hyah!

2129
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,760
- Glue.
- I'm proud to be a yellow.

2130
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,050
I like your pony.

2131
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,390
Thank you.

2132
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,390
What?

2133
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:12,310
Ah, ah, ah. No, no, no.

2134
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:19,360
Now let's crack that big nut.

2135
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,530
Oh, no.
It's about to go worldwide.

2136
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,780
How are we gonna get up there?

2137
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:27,490
- Really?
- Well, you got grit.

2138
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,120
I'll give you that.

2139
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Gumption, even. Very admirable.

2140
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,330
And yet, uh, annoying.

2141
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,580
Quite annoying. Yeah.

2142
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:38,170
I'm gonna have to,
you know, uh, stop you.

2143
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,420
Glue me, glue me, glue me.

2144
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,960
Precious, sic him.

2145
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,300
You're too little and too late.

2146
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,430
Ah, ba-bad dog.

2147
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:47,760
-Pets aren't allowed in school.
-Aah! Precious!

2148
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,930
And you, my pudgy protégé.

2149
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,270
Go, go, go, go! Move! Move!

2150
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,270
I offered you the world.

2151
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,730
We could have been partners.

2152
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,610
I've got something better
than a partner.

2153
01:27:57,650 --> 01:27:59,690
-I have a brother.
-Yeah!

2154
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,900
- Let go.
- No, you let go.

2155
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,110
Wow. Point taken.

2156
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:05,820
What? What's going on?

2157
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,450
Hey, that's my leisure suit.

2158
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:11,870
It looks better on her.

2159
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:13,370
Hands up, diapers down.

2160
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:14,790
Things are about to get weird.

2161
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,500
Yeah, that's my girls!

2162
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:18,460
-That's really Dad?
-Yep.

2163
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,670
I said a lot of stuff
to that kid.

2164
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:22,460
Well, quite the family reunion.

2165
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,920
Uh, the more the merrier.

2166
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:26,090
- I say let's call your parents.
- Oh, no.

2167
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,300
-Uh-oh.
-Okay.

2168
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:31,640
Mommy and Daddy,
let's hug 'em-- to death.

2169
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,560
Oh, don't worry about us.
Get to the server.

2170
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,480
Go, Tina, go!

2171
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,360
-Hey!
-You got this, Tina.

2172
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,730
Get down from there.

2173
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,490
Go for his lollies!

2174
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,820
Never touch another man's pony.

2175
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:49,280
Here. Stick around.
Stick around.

2176
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,700
Uh, Tim, what do we do now?!

2177
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,660
Don't move.
Maybe they won't see us.

2178
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,330
They see us, Tim. They see us.

2179
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:56,710
Did you move? I didn't move.

2180
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,170
Really, Tim?

2181
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:00,000
Oh. Hey, that's a little
too high now.

2182
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,840
Don't look down.
Look straight ahead, okay?

2183
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,380
It's locked.

2184
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,180
Can I give you a hand?

2185
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,470
Of course,
I mean that facetiously,

2186
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,180
because the hand acts as a...
as a key.

2187
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,520
No, no. No, no, no.

2188
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,230
-Hey, hey. No, no, no, no.
-Thanks, sis.

2189
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,520
Stay away from my server.

2190
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,520
-Shut it down, Tabitha.
-What are you doing?

2191
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,440
What are you doing?
No, no, no! No!

2192
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,190
Don't do that.

2193
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:25,570
Oh, no!

2194
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,200
-Hugs.
-Hug Grandpa.

2195
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,780
It's Night of
the Living Boomers.

2196
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:31,870
- Dad, stop!
- Hugs.

2197
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,540
Back.
Back, you little monsters.

2198
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,960
You back off, candy pants.

2199
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,210
Ha! Got your nose.

2200
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:46,050
Oh, right in the breadbasket!

2201
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:54,760
-Ow!
-Ha!

2202
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:56,220
-Knocked his block off.
-Ah, poopy.

2203
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,060
Tina, I think I got it. Yes!

2204
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,230
Don't hit that button.
Don't hit that button. Aah!

2205
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,060
Ow! Ooh!

2206
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,770
- And... enter.
- No, no! Stop it!

2207
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:06,820
Cut it out.

2208
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,610
- Look what you made me do.
- The fire alarm.

2209
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,410
- Darn it.
- Dad!

2210
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,780
Uncle Ted!
Pull the fire alarm!

2211
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,410
- The girls need help.
- No kissies!

2212
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:17,700
The girls need us.

2213
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:20,540
Time's up, halflings.

2214
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:23,590
Great galloping gargoyles!

2215
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:27,090
What? What?

2216
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,340
Tim! Get to the fire alarm!

2217
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,800
I'll hold them back.

2218
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,090
Make it rain, baby.

2219
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,430
I'm on it.

2220
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,890
What's the matter?

2221
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,470
You can't
handle the awkward phase?

2222
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,980
Go, Marcos... uh, Dad. Go!

2223
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,480
I'm back!

2224
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,980
-Here we go.
-Come on.

2225
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,110
How about another round,
you tough guy? Come on!

2226
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,530
Ow. Stop it.

2227
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:48,940
I still got these.

2228
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,610
You put my sister down.

2229
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:53,820
B-Day will happen,
whether you like it or not.

2230
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:56,120
You shall not pass!

2231
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,040
Uh, you shall not pass.

2232
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,750
No! Stop passing.

2233
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,710
Yeah, Dad!

2234
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,170
Way to go!

2235
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:07,880
That's it?

2236
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,170
That's right. Why? What?
The school's expensive.

2237
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,300
I had to cut costs someplace.

2238
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,470
Oh, no. It's not working.

2239
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:15,640
Did you pull it right?

2240
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,970
How else you gonna pull it?

2241
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:19,020
You'll see I'm right.

2242
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:20,640
I'll show everybody.

2243
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,810
The age of parents is over.

2244
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:31,150
Yay, yay, yay.

2245
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:33,820
How about you watch me
have a little toast?

2246
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:37,120
To the baby revolution
and to me.

2247
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,620
-It's time for the
candy volcano... -Mmm, mmm.

2248
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,500
- Oh, that's good.
- Of doom!

2249
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,500
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

2250
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,000
No, no, no! No!

2251
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,510
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2252
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:52,170
-No, no, no.
-Boom shakalaka?

2253
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,840
-Boom!
-Don't do that!

2254
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:00,720
Whoa!

2255
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,350
Oh, no!

2256
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:03,850
Tabitha!

2257
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,730
No! Someone help me, please!

2258
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:08,690
Tabitha, hang on!

2259
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:11,030
Ted, I need upsies-- now.

2260
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:19,200
Dad, help me!

2261
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,330
Look at you.

2262
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:22,200
You're smart. You're strong.

2263
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,540
You don't need parents.

2264
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,580
What can they possibly
offer you?

2265
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,040
How about unconditional love?

2266
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,790
-That's what.
-No, no, no. No.

2267
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,010
- Sayonara.
- No, no, no. No.

2268
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,590
Tabitha!

2269
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,020
-I'm gonna fall!
-Tabitha!

2270
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,230
Hang on!

2271
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,940
I got you. I got you.

2272
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:52,030
I got you, Tabitha.

2273
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:56,610
I got you.

2274
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,160
That's my big brother.

2275
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,950
Thanks, Marcos Lightspeed.

2276
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,620
Mwah.

2277
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:09,460
I thought we both
had to grow up.

2278
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,920
Well, let's not
grow up too fast.

2279
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,840
I love you, Dad.

2280
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,760
I love you, Tabitha Templeton.

2281
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,970
Aw. You see that?

2282
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,260
And you wanted
to take it all away.

2283
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,760
-Where you going?
-Home.

2284
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:25,640
You know, Doc,
childhood doesn't last forever,

2285
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,520
but family sure does.

2286
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,270
Uncle Ted! Heads up!

2287
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:31,060
Woo-hoo!

2288
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:33,440
We win! Get ready
to order some pizzas.

2289
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:47,040
Woo-hoo!

2290
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,210
Cool!

2291
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:57,010
Huzzah!

2292
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:59,090
Huzzah!

2293
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,560
Oh, sweet.

2294
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,650
He who findeth keepeth.

2295
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:17,690
Mommy, Daddy,
I missed you so much.

2296
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:20,110
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yay!

2297
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,320
Junior!

2298
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,120
Glue!

2299
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,240
So soft.

2300
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,700
Where are we going?

2301
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,000
Not bad, Templetons.

2302
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,750
Woo-hoo! Yay, Templetons.

2303
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:31,250
Yeah, mission accomplished.

2304
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:34,420
And as a bonus,
we stopped Armstrong, too.

2305
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,960
-Huh?
-What?

2306
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,840
My real mission was
getting you two back together.

2307
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,680
A-plus! See me after class.

2308
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,430
Wait, so you never
actually quit?

2309
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:44,680
-Nope.
-Huh.

2310
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,850
Well played.

2311
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,180
I don't like to mix the two,

2312
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,730
but I will say
it was never business.

2313
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:50,270
It was always personal.

2314
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:51,640
You know what, kid?

2315
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:53,940
You're the best boss
I ever had.

2316
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,570
Thank you, chief.

2317
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:57,190
Tim! You actually made it.

2318
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:59,400
-Yeah.
-I mean, I knew you'd make it.

2319
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,070
-Teddy.
-Teddy, you're here.

2320
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:03,240
-And look what you're wearing.
-Uh...

2321
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,200
Sweetheart, I cried.

2322
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,370
Then I went blank.

2323
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:08,160
Oh, come on.
Every-Everyone get together.

2324
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,040
This... We got to get this.
Here we go.

2325
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,710
-Dad, no! -No!
-What?

2326
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,630
* We know that *

2327
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,500
* Divided we'll fall *

2328
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:22,930
* So together we stand *

2329
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:27,720
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2330
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:35,230
* So together we stand. *

2331
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,110
-Yay, Tabitha!
-That was beautiful!

2332
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:39,110
The crowd goes wild!

2333
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,400
Thank you. Thank you.

2334
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,740
Aah!

2335
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,410
Aw, hey, Precious.

2336
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:45,780
You're amazing.

2337
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:47,660
Oh, I wish Teddy
could have been here.

2338
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,740
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

2339
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:53,460
Hmm.

2340
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,250
Hey, I was just...

2341
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:05,890
Merry Christmas, Tim.

2342
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:08,100
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there with you,

2343
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:10,430
but please enjoy this

2344
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:13,140
inappropriately lavish gift
instead.

2345
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:22,110
You've given me
the greatest gift of all.

2346
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:23,820
You.

2347
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:27,280
Love, the best brother
in the world.

2348
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,620
P.S. Duck.

2349
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,460
In your face, Leslie!

2350
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,250
Hey. Oh, it is on, Lindsey!

2351
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:39,750
-No. No, no, no, no. Don't,
don't, don't. -Come here!

2352
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:40,960
I'm younger than you.

2353
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,380
You're a bigger target.

2354
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:43,970
I got you so good!

2355
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:45,470
No, you didn't.

2356
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:46,800
Aah! You missed me!

2357
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,470
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

2358
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:49,890
-Ambush.
-Exactly.

2359
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,350
- Ow!
- Sneak attack!

2360
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:53,480
Oh, isn't it great
to see them fighting again?

2361
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,810
Finally.

2362
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:59,520
Shouldn't you pick up?

2363
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,480
Nah, we got some
family business.

2364
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,030
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

2365
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,370
Tina, we have
another assignment for you.

2366
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:12,120
I'm listening.

2367
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,160
Grandma's coming in hot!

2368
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,750
-You want some of Grandpa?
-Everyone, get Tagalong Teddy!

2369
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,500
- It's true.
- Gotcha!

2370
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,210
You can't stop time.

2371
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,590
But every once in a while,
you get a second chance.

2372
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:24,380
I'm gonna get you!

2373
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,050
So, even though
you're only a kid once...

2374
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,880
well, unless you get
to be a kid twice,

2375
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:30,140
which is really weird,
to be honest,

2376
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:33,140
but the point is
you have to grow up sometime.

2377
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:38,140
And you should always
be nice to your brother.

2378
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:40,230
Ah,
that was really sweet, Daddy.

2379
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:42,110
That'll be great for my report.

2380
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:44,320
Okay, so... so that's it, then.

2381
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,070
Well, actually,
there's one more little thing.

2382
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:04,630
Mama? Papa?

2383
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:05,960
Wha...

2384
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:09,090
Oh, my son.

2385
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,680
You came home.

2386
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,720
Oh, yeah. Right.

2387
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:17,560
Okay, Pops. Now.

2388
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,850
The end.

2389
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:18,450
* Catch my eye *

2390
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,250
* Take my hand *

2391
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:26,630
* This bond is tighter
than we ever planned *

2392
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:29,050
* Give me courage *

2393
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,420
* So I can land *

2394
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:35,010
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2395
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:39,100
* So together we stand *

2396
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,770
* Climb with me *

2397
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,810
* Share my dreams *

2398
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,610
* Tomorrow's brighter *

2399
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:50,900
* Than it's ever been *

2400
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:53,660
* Fear no danger *

2401
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,030
* Make big plans *

2402
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:59,700
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2403
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:04,620
* So together we stand *

2404
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:07,790
* Laugh and cry with me *

2405
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,050
* Fly that high with me *

2406
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:13,010
* See the sunset
and the sunrise *

2407
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:15,720
* The world looks so good
through our eyes *

2408
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,600
* Like the moon *

2409
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,810
* And stars at night *

2410
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,810
* Rest your head *

2411
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:26,520
* Tell me your thoughts *

2412
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:29,770
* Everything I have
and call mine *

2413
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,940
* Is all yours *

2414
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:34,740
* Sail that ocean *

2415
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:37,200
* Find that sand *

2416
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,700
* We know that
divided we'll fall *

2417
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:45,040
* So together we stand *

2418
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:07,270
* Reach with me *

2419
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:10,360
* See the sky *

2420
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:15,570
* I'll always be here
for the rest of your life *

2421
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:18,280
* Side by side *

2423
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:26,670

no one else can understand *

2424
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:29,170
* Hear those cheers *

2425

2428

* We know that *

2429
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:46,770
* Divided we'll fall *

2430
