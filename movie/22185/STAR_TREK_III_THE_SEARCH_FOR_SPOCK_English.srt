1
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,484
Don't grieve, Admiral.


2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,780
It is logical.


3
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,578
The needs of the many outweigh...


4
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,833
The needs of the few.


5
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,544
Or the one.


6
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:50,467
And I have been,
and always shall be, your friend.


7
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,558
Live long and prosper.


8
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,816
We are assembled here today


9
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,069
to pay final respects
to our honoured dead.


10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,491
This death takes place
in the shadow of new life,


11
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,869
the sunrise of a new world,


12
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:21,540
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect and nourish.


13
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,003
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one.


14
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,842
Of my friend, I can only say this.


15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,350
Of all the souls
I have encountered in my travels,


16
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,187
his was the most


17
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,025
human.


18
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,446
Honours.


19
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,762
Space, the final frontier.


20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,685
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.


21
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:29,566
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,


22
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,196
fo seek out new life forms
and new civilisations,


23
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:41,703
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.


24
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,415
U.S.S. Enterprise,
Captain’s personal log.


25
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,420
With most of our battle damage
repaired, we're almost home,


26
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,091
yet I feel uneasy,


27
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,468
and I wonder why.


28
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,435
Perhaps it is the emptiness
of this vessel.


29
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,440
Most of our trainee crew
have been reassigned.


30
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,069
Lieutenant Saavik and my son David
are exploring the Genesis planet,


31
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,821
which he helped create,


32
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,742
and Enterprise feels like a house
with all the children gone.


33
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,704
No. More empty even than that.


34
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,959
The death of Spock
is like an open wound.


35
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,881
It seems that I have left
the noblest part of myself back there


36
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,717
on that newborn planet.


37
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,262
Status, Mr Sulu.


38
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,141
On course, Admiral.
Estimating spacedock in 2.1 hours.


39
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,186
Very well. Mr Chekov,
I'll need a pre-approach scan.


40
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,688
Take the science station, please.


41
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,815
-Yes, Sir.
-Uhura.


42
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,570
Any response from Starfleet
on our Project Genesis inquiries?


43
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,655
No, sir. There is no response.


44
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,949
That's very odd.


45
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,412
Scotty, progress report.


46
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,122
It's almost done, sir.


47
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,750
You'll be fully automated
by the time we dock.


48
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,835
Your timing is excellent, Mr Scott.


49
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,380
You fixed the barn door
after the horse has come home.


50
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,383
How much refit time
till we can take her out again?


51
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,593
Eight weeks, sir,


52
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,137
but you don't have eight weeks,
so I'll do it for you in two.


53
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,308
Mr Scott, have you always
multiplied your repair estimates


54
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,684
by a factor of four?


55
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,731
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep
my reputation as a miracle-worker?


56
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,942
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.


57
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,571
Mr Sulu, take the conn.
I'll be in my quarters.


58
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,031
Aye, sir.


59
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,407
Sir?


60
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,746
I was wondering, are they planning
a ceremony when we get in?


61
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,623
I mean a reception?


62
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,835
A hero's welcome, son,
is that what you'd like?


63
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,879
Well, God knows there should be.


64
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,008
This time we've paid for the party
with our dearest blood.


65
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,670
Steady. Steady, boys.


66
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,006
Keep scanning.


67
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,678
I thought you people were reliable.
Where the hell is he?


68
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,057
He's been here for some time.
Put me on hailing frequency.


69
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,438
Commander Kruge, this is Valkris.


70
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,941
I have purchased the Genesis data.


71
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,569
Ready to transmit.


72
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,364
Well done, Valkris. Well done.


73
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,283
What the hell is...


74
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,076
Disengage cloaking device!


75
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,887
Transmit data.


76
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,680
Now!


77
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,196
Transmission completed.


78
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,785
You will find it useful.


79
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,830
Then you have seen it?


80
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,333
I have, my lord.


81
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,126
Unfortunate.


82
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,712
Understood.


83
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,931
Thrusters.


84
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,903
What the hell's going on?
When do I get paid off?


85
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,698
Soon, Captain. Quite soon.


86
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,331
Success my lord.


87
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,667
and my love.


88
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,130
You will be remembered with honour.


89
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,176
Firel


90
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,402
New course, Federation neutral zone.


91
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,867
Feed him!


92
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,535
Yes, my lord.


93
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,069
Approach control, this is Enterprise.
Ready for docking manoeuvre.


94
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,905
Enterprise is cleared to dock.


95
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,281
L ock on.


96
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,495
Systems locked.


97
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,582
Spacedock, you have control.


98
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,503
Affirmative, Enterprise.
Enjoy the ride, and welcome home.


99
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,380
Enterprise confirms.


100
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,073
Moving in.


101
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,200
Acknowledged. Doors closing.


102
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,584
Would you look at that.


103
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,131
My friends, the great experiment,


104
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,050
the Excelsior,


105
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,678
ready for trial runs.


106
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,559
She's supposed to have
transwarp drive.


107
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,147
Aye, and if my grandmother had wheels,
she'd be a wagon.


108
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,734
Come, come, Mr Scott.
Young minds, fresh ideas. Be tolerant.


109
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,781
-Acknowledged. Doors are closing.
-Updating.


110
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,599
Stand by umbilical and gravitational
support systems.


111
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:31,060
Aye, sir. Moorings activated.
All systems standing by.


112
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,314
Admiral, this is not possible.


113
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,857
Mr Chekov?


114
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,112
An energy reading from C-deck,
from inside Mr Spock's quarters.


115
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,656
I ordered Spock's quarters sealed.


116
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,909
Yes, sir. I sealed the room myself.


117
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,912
Nevertheless, I am reading
a life form there.


118
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,664
This entire crew seems
on the edge of obsessive behaviour


119
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,374
concerning Mr Spock.


120
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,424
Sir, security reports the door
to Spock's quarters has been forced.


121
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,219
I'm on my way.
Mr Sulu, continue docking procedure.


122
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,595
Aye, sir.


123
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,644
Jim, help me.


124
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,318
You left me on Genesis.


125
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,530
Why did you do that?


126
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,490
Help me.


127
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,122
Bones.


128
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,668
What the hell are you doing?


129
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,337
Have you lost your mind?


130
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,216
Help me, Jim. Take me home.


131
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,054
Bones, we are. We are home.


132
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,352
Then perhaps it's not too late.
Climb the steps, Jim.


133
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,981
Climb the steps of Mount Seleya.


134
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,651
Mount Seleya?


135
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:50,158
Bones, Mount Seleya is on Vulcan.
We're home, on Earth.


136
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,412
Remember.


137
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,458
Admiral, docking is completed.


138
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,961
Starfleet Commander Morrow
is on his way for inspection.


139
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,547
Uhura, get the medics down here!


140
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,424
Get them now!


141
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,601
You've all done remarkable service
under the most difficult conditions.


142
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,812
You'll be receiving
Starfleet's highest commendation,


143
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,107
and more importantly,
extended shore leave.


144
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,486
That is, all but you, Mr Scott.


145
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,072
They need your wisdom
on the new Excelsior.


146
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,241
Report there tomorrow
as captain of engineering.


147
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,327
With all appreciation, sir,


148
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,497
I'd prefer to supervise
the refit of Enterprise.


149
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,624
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.


150
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,502
But, sir...


151
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,506
I'm sorry, Mr Scott,
but there will be no refit.


152
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,926
Admiral, I don't understand.


153
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,305
-The Enterprise is not...
-Jim, the Enterprise is 20 years old.


154
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,766
We feel her day is over.


155
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,477
But we had requested...


156
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,023
We'd hoped to take her back
to Genesis.


157
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,817
That is out of the question.


158
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,402
May I ask why?


159
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,155
In your absence, Genesis has become
a galactic controversy.


160
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,829
Until the Federation Council
makes policy,


161
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:23,543
you are all under orders not to discuss
with anyone your knowledge of Genesis.


162
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:29,257
Consider it a quarantined planet
and a forbidden subject.


163
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,561
To fully understand
the events on which I report,


164
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,855
it Is necessary to review
the theoretical data


165
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,523
on the Genesis device,


166
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,484
as developed
by Doctors Carol and David Marcus.


167
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,572
Genesis, simply put,
is life from lifelessness.


168
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,366
It was the intention to introduce
the Genesis device


169
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,911
Into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body,


170
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,080
a moon or other dead form.


171
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,249
The device, when delivered,


172
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,377
would instantaneously cause
the Genesis effect.


173
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,090
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet now exists,


174
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:16,220
capable of sustaining whatever
life forms we see fit to deposit on it.


175
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,153
So?


176
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,114
Speak.


177
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,454
Great power to control, dominate.


178
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,457
Speak.


179
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,252
Impressive. They can make planets.


180
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,423
Oh, yes.
New cities, homes in the country,


181
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:55,676
your woman at your side,
children playing at your feet,


182
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,223
and overhead, fluttering in the breeze,
the flag of the Federation.


183
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,933
Charming.


184
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,810
Station.


185
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,353
Yes, my lord.


186
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,235
-Share this with no one.
-Understood, my lord.


187
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,613
We are going to this planet.


188
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,993
Even as our emissaries negotiate
for peace with the Federation,


189
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,038
we will act
for the preservation of our race.


190
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,917
We will seize the secret of this weapon,


191
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,128
the secret of ultimate power.


192
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,923
Success, my lord.


193
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,949
We have reached destination planet
at .035.


194
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,118
Very well, Lieutenant.


195
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,955
Helm, execute standard
orbital approach.


196
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,040
Standard orbit. Aye, sir.


197
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,792
Communications,


198
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,671
send a coded message
for Starfleet Commander, priority one.


199
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,924
Federation science vessel Grissom
arriving Genesis planet,


200
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,093
Mutara Sector to begin research.


201
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,970
J.T. Esteban, commanding.


202
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,889
Aye, sir. Coding now.


203
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,892
Dr Marcus, it's your planet.


204
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,477
Begin scanning, please.


205
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,482
This is where the fun begins, Saavik.


206
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,861
Just like your father, so human.


207
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,365
All units functional. Recorders are on.
Scanning Sector 1.


208
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,328
Foliage in fully-developed
state of growth.


209
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,040
Temperature, 22.2 Celsius.


210
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,544
Sector 2 indicating desert terrain.
Minimal vegetation.


211
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,006
Temperature, 39.4.


212
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,009
Sector 3, subtropical vegetation.


213
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,180
Temperature decreasing rapidly.


214
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:11,187
It's snow.
Snow in the same sector. Fantastic.


215
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,147
Fascinating.


216
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,068
All the varieties of land and weather
known to Earth within a few hours' walk.


217
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,820
Metallic mass.


218
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,530
Close-range scan.


219
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,371
A photon tube.
Gravitational fields were in flux.


220
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,623
It must have soft-landed.


221
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,500
In code to Starfleet.


222
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,711
Captain Spock's tube located
on Genesis' surface.


223
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,047
Yes, sir. Coding your message.


224
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,720
I don't believe it.


225
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,306
What is it?


226
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:53,229
If equipment is functioning properly,
indications are an animal life form.


227
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,150
-You said there wouldn't be any.
-There shouldn't be any.


228
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,738
Cross-referenced and verified.
An unidentifiable life-form reading.


229
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,325
-Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
-Wait a minute.


230
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,036
We don't know
what we're talking about here.


231
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,414
-Why don't we beam it up?
-Oh, no, you don't.


232
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,792
Regulations specifically state,
"Nothing shall be beamed aboard


233
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,586
"until danger of contamination
has been eliminated."


234
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,589
Captain, the logical alternative
iS obvious.


235
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,258
Beaming down
to the surface is permitted.


236
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,511
If the Captain decides
that the mission is vital


237
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,304
and reasonably free of danger.


238
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,891
Captain, please, we'll take the risk,
but we've got to find out what it is.


239
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:31,976
Or who.


240
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,774
Absent friends.


241
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,113
Admiral, what's gonna happen
to the Enterprise?


242
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,867
-She's to be decommissioned.
-Will we get another ship?


243
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,785
I can't get an answer.


244
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,622
Starfleet is up to its brass
in a galactic conference.


245
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,043
No one has time
for those who only stand and wait.


246
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,379
Sir, about Dr McCoy, how is he?


247
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:03,215
Well, that's the good news.
He's home, resting comfortably,


248
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,301
pumped full of tranquilisers.


249
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,762
They say it's exhaustion.


250
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,431
He promised me he'd stay put.
Well, we'll see.


251
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,891
Mr Scott.


252
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,310
Come.


253
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,947
Sarek!


254
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
Ambassador, I had no idea
you were here.


255
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,331
I believe you know my crew.


256
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,667
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.


257
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,797
Please excuse us.


258
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,595
Ambassador,
I would have come to Vulcan


259
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,180
to express my deepest sympathies...


260
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,767
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk.
I have been to your government.


261
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,395
I have seen the Genesis information
and your own report.


262
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,565
Then you know how bravely
your son met his death.


263
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,026
Why did you leave him on Genesis?


264
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,114
Spock trusted you,
and you denied him his future.


265
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:14,370
-1 saw no future.
-Only his body was in death, Kirk,


266
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,289
and you were the last one
to be with him.


267
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,374
Yes, I was.


268
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,418
And you must know that you should
have come with him to Vulcan.


269
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,380
-But why?
-Because he asked you to.


270
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,133
He entrusted you


271
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,055
with his very essence,
with everything that was not of the body.


272
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,225
He asked you to bring him to us


273
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:42,231
and to bring that which he gave you,
his katra, his living spirit.


274
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,817
Sir.


275
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,739
Your son meant more to me
than you can know.


276
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,369
I'd have given my life
if it would have saved his.


277
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,956
Believe me when I tell you,
he made no request of me.


278
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,042
He would not have spoken of it openly.


279
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:06,380
-Then how...
-Kirk, I must have your thoughts.


280
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,383
May I join your mind?


281
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:13,929
Certainly.


282
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,784
He spoke of your friendship.


283
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,871
Yes.


284
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,959
He asked you not to grieve.


285
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,755
Yes.


286
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,800
The needs of the many


287
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,679
outweigh...


288
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,892
The needs of the few.


289
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,436
Or the one.


290
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,899
Spock.


291
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,527
I have been,


292
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,156
and always shall be,


293
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,742
your friend.


294
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,331
Live long and prosper.


295
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,501
No.


296
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,058
Forgive me.


297
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,687
It IS not here.


298
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,025
I had assumed
he mind-melded with you.


299
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,446
It is the Vulcan way
when the body's end is near.


300
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,533
We were separate.


301
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,120
He couldn't touch me.


302
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,038
I see.


303
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,586
Then everything that he was,


304
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,590
everything he knew,


305
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,094
1S lost.


306
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,897
Please walit.


307
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,321
He would have found a way.
If there was that much at stake,


308
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,740
Spock would have found a way.


309
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,076
Yes. But how?


310
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,956
What if he joined with someone else?


311
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,839
Engine room, flight recorder visual.
Stardate 8128.78.


312
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,965
Go.


313
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,010
The ship.


314
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,596
Out of danger?


315
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,057
Yes.


316
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,934
Back .77.


317
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,481
Flight recorder visual 28.77.


318
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,857
Go.


319
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,193
No! You'll flood the whole compartment.


320
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,321
-He'll die.
-Kirk! He's dead already.


321
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,990
Back .76.


322
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,539
Flight recorder visual 28.76.


323
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,791
Go.


324
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,959
You're not going in there.


325
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,464
Perhaps you're right.
What is Mr Scott's condition?


326
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,383
Well I don't think that he...


327
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,969
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I have no time to discuss this logically.


328
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,765
Freeze.


329
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,811
Repeat and augment.


330
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,524
Remember.


331
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:02,741
-McCoy!
-One alive, one not, yet both in pain.


332
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,160
What must I do?


333
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,039
You must bring them to Mount Seleya
on Vulcan.


334
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,292
Only there can both find peace.


335
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:18,006
What you ask is difficult.


336
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,844
You will find a way, Kirk.


337
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,600
If you honour them both, you must.


338
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,812
I will.


339
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,023
I swear.


340
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,323
Transporter Room,
stand by to energise.


341
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,909
Aye, sir. Energising now.


342
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,595
Grissom to Saavik.


343
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,014
We're picking up radiation
from the life form.


344
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,934
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings
are well below danger level.


345
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,395
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant.


346
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,441
This landing is Captain's discretion,
and I'm the one who's out on a limb.


347
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,235
I'll try to remember that, Captain.


348
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,045
There are your life forms.


349
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,464
These were microbes
on the tube's surface.


350
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,966
We shot them here from Enterprise.


351
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,929
They were fruitful and multiplied.


352
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,848
But how could they have
evolved so quickly?


353
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,946
Saavik.


354
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,124
What is it?


355
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,794
Spock's burial robe.


356
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,814
No. Absolutely not, Jim.
You're my best officer,


357
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,067
but I am Commander, Starfleet,
so I don't break rules.


358
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,196
Don't quote rules to me.
I'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice.


359
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,867
One man who's died for us,
another with deep emotional problems.


360
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,496
Now walit a minute.
This business about Spock and McCoy,


361
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,584
honestly, I never understood
Vulcan mysticism.


362
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:03,171
You don't have to believe.
I'm not even sure that I believe,


363
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,551
but if there's even a chance
that Spock has an eternal soul,


364
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,680
-then it's my responsibility.
-Yours?


365
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,184
As surely as If it were my very own.


366
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,481
Give me back the Enterprise.
With Scotty's help I could...


367
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,152
No, Jim. The Enterprise would never
stand the pounding, and you know it.


368
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,446
Then I'll find a ship. I'll hire a ship.


369
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,865
Out of the question, my friend.


370
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:34,494
The council has ordered that no one
but the science team goes to Genesis.


371
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:39,333
Jim, your life and your career
stand for rationality,


372
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,126
not for intellectual chaos.


373
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,838
Keep up this emotional behaviour
and you'll lose everything.


374
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:48,759
You'll destroy yourself.
Do you understand me, Jim?


375
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,387
I hear you.


376
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,267
-I had to try.
-Of course.


377
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,729
-Thanks for the drink.
-Anytime.


378
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,156
-The word, sir?
-The word is no.


379
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,908
I am therefore going anyway.


380
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,994
-You can count on our help, sir.
-Thank you, Mr Sulu. I'll need it.


381
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,371
Shall I alert Dr McCoy?


382
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,290
Please. He has a long journey
ahead of him.


383
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,732
Long time, Doc.


384
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,611
Yeah. Anybody been looking for me?


385
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,698
I have, but what's the use?
What'll it be?


386
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,366
Altair water.


387
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,660
That's not your usual poison.


388
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,375
To expect one to order poison in a bar
is not logical.


389
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,252
Got it.


390
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:18,306
To your planet, welcome.


391
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,062
I think that's my line, stranger.


392
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,607
Forgive. I here am new,


393
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:32,738
but you are known,
being McCoy from Enterprise.


394
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:41,037
-You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
-l name not important. You seek II.


395
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,501
Message received.
Available ship stands by.


396
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,801
-How much and how soon?
-How soon is now. How much is where.


397
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,805
Somewhere in the Mutara Sector.


398
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:05,729
Mutara restricted.
Take permits many. Money more.


399
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,191
There aren't going to be
any damn permits.


400
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,986
How can you get a permit
to do a damn illegal thing?


401
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:17,032
Look, price you name, money I got.


402
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:22,162
Place you name. Money I name.
Otherwise, bargain no.


403
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,124
All right, damn it. It's Genesis.


404
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,835
The name of the place we're going
is Genesis!


405
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,963
-Genesis?
-Yes, Genesis!


406
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,133
How can you be deaf
with ears like that?


407
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,012
Genesis allowed is not.
Is planet forbidden!


408
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,473
Look, my backwards friend,


409
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,976
Genesis may be planet forbidden,
but I'm damn well...


410
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,898
Sir, I'm sorry, but your voice is carrying.


411
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,818
I don't think you want to be discussing
this subject in public.


412
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,154
I'll discuss what I like,
and who in the hell are you?


413
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,323
Could I offer you a ride home,
Dr McCoy?


414
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,284
Where's the logic in offering me
a ride home, you idiot?


415
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,494
If I wanted a ride home,


416
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,830
would I be trying
to charter a space flight?


417
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,753
-How In the hell do you know who I am?
-Federation security, sir.


418
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,139
You're gonna get a nice long rest,
Doctor.


419
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,538
Saavik to Grissom.


420
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,583
We are definitely reading
a second life form.


421
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,295
We concur.
Proceed with caution, Saavik.


422
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,966
What the hell is going on down there?


423
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,677
Make it quick, Admiral.


424
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,597
They're moving him
to the Federation funny farm.


425
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,892
Yes, poor friend.
I hear he's fruity as a nut cake.


426
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,436
Two minutes.


427
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,693
Jim.


428
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,239
-How many fingers do I have up?
-That's not very damn funny.


429
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,910
-Your sense of humour's returned.
-The hell it has. What's that?


430
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,663
-Lexorin.
-Lexorin? What for?


431
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,584
You're suffering from
a Vulcan mind-meld, Doctor.


432
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,378
That green-blooded son of a bitch.


433
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,633
It's his revenge
for all those arguments he lost.


434
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,010
Let me see your hand.


435
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,847
This will make you
well enough to travel.


436
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,476
Where's Admiral Kirk?


437
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,436
-He's with the prisoner.
-Get him quickly.


438
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,272
Commander, Starfleet wants him
right away.


439
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,446
Keeping you busy?


440
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,246
Don't get smart, Tiny.


441
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,709
-Admiral, Starfleet...
-This man's sick. Here, take a look.


442
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,549
Side elevator. Agents on their way up.


443
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,143
Don't call me Tiny.


444
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,149
Unit two, this is unit one.


445
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,860
The Kobayashi Maru has set salil
for the promised land.


446
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:43,029
-Acknowledge.
-Message acknowledged.


447
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,240
All units will be informed.


448
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:50,161
-You're taking me to the promised land?
-What are friends for?


449
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,881
-Mr Scott, calling it a night?
-Yes, sir.


450
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,550
Turning in myself.
Looking forward to breaking


451
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,802
some of the Enterprise’s
speed records tomorrow.


452
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,430
Yes, sir. Good night.


453
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,142
-Level, please.
-Transporter Room.


454
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,853
-Thank you.
-Up your shaft.


455
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,942
Roger. Old City Station at 2200 hours.
All is well.


456
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,194
Understood. All stations clear.


457
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,864
-You amaze me, Commander.
-How is that?


458
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,699
A 20-year space veteran,


459
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,285
yet you choose
the worst duty station in town.


460
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,789
I mean, look at this place.
This is the hind end of space.


461
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,251
Peace and quiet
appeals to me, Lieutenant.


462
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,754
Yeah, well, maybe that's okay
for someone like you,


463
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,173
whose career is winding down,


464
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:47,260
but me, I need some challenge
in my life, some adventure,


465
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,013
maybe even just a surprise or two.


466
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,557
Well, you know what they say,
Lieutenant.


467
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,685
Be careful what you wish for.
You may get it.


468
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,524
Good evening, Commander.
Is everything ready?


469
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,943
Step into my parlour, gentlemen.


470
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,321
That's Admiral Kirk. My God!


471
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,239
Very good for you, Lieutenant.


472
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:12,660
But it's damn irregular.
No destination orders, no encoded IDs.


473
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,246
-All true.
-Well, what are we gonna do about it?


474
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,709
I'm not gonna do anything about it,
but you're gonna sit in the closet.


475
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:23,505
The closet? What, have you lost
all your sense of reality?


476
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,132
This isn't reality.


477
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,471
This is fantasy.
You wanted adventure, how's this?


478
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,391
The old adrenaline going? Good boy.
Now get in the closet.


479
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,684
Okay.


480
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,605
Go on. Go on.


481
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,857
I'll jJust get in the closet.


482
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,400
Okay!


483
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,323
-I'm glad you're on our side.
-Can you handle that?


484
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,493
I'll have "Mr. Adventure”
eating out of my hand, sir,


485
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,037
and I'll see all of you at the rendezvous.


486
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,206
And, Admiral,


487
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,750
all my hopes.


488
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,815
As promised, she's all yours, sir.
All systems automated and ready.


489
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,068
A chimpanzee and two trainees
could run her.


490
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,238
Thank you, Mr Scott,
I'll try not to take that personally.


491
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,579
My friends,
I can't ask you to go any further.


492
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,957
Dr McCoy and I have to do this.
The rest of you do not.


493
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,585
Admiral, we're losing precious time.


494
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,421
What course, please, Admiral?


495
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,756
Mr Scott?


496
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,051
I'd be grateful, Admiral,
if you'd give the word.


497
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,181
Gentlemen,


498
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,768
may the wind be at our backs.
Stations, please.


499
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,900
-Engage all the systems.
-Aye, engaged!


500
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,527
-Clear all moorings.
-Cleared, sir.


501
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,779
One-quarter impulse power.


502
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,324
One-quarter impulse.


503
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,757
Sir, Commander, Starfleet
on emergency channel.


504
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,092
He orders you to surrender this vessel.


505
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,136
-No reply, Chekov.
-Aye, sir.


506
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,971
Steady as she goes, Sulu.


507
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,813
Yellow alert. Captain to the Bridge.
Yellow alert.


508
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,816
Bridge, this is the Captain.


509
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,236
How can you have
a yellow alert in spacedock?


510
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,072
Sir, someone is stealing the Enterprise.


511
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,159
I'm on my way.


512
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,330
Alert. Yellow alert.
All stations, yellow alert.


513
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:06,668
Alert. Yellow alert.
All stations, yellow alert.


514
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,174
One minute to spacedoors.


515
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,427
Are you just gonna walk through them?


516
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:17,512
Calm yourself, Doctor.


517
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,481
Sir, Excelsior powering up
with orders to pursue.


518
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,358
Yellow alert.


519
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,027
-Status?
-Yellow alert.


520
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,906
All automates ready and functioning.
Automatic moorings retracted.


521
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,951
All speeds available
through transwarp drive.


522
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,744
Incredible machine.


523
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,205
Helm.


524
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,209
One-quarter impulse power.


525
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,592
Thirty seconds to spacedoors.


526
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,304
Warning. Secure spacedoors.


527
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,682
Warning. Secure spacedoors.


528
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,518
-Warning. Secure spacedoors.
-And...


529
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,478
-Now, Mr Scott.
-Sir?


530
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,316
-The doors, Mr Scott.
-Aye, sir. I'm working on it.


531
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:18,323
Danger. Spacedoors are closed.
Danger.


532
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,410
Danger. Spacedoors are closed.


533
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,978
We have cleared spacedoors.


534
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,286
-Full impulse power.
-Aye, sir.


535
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,796
Stand by tractor beam.


536
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,547
Tractor beam, aye.


537
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:21,427
If he tries to get away with warp drive,
he's really in for a shock.


538
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,945
Excelsior closing to 4,000 metres, sir.


539
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,571
Scotty, we'll need everything you have.


540
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,074
Aye, sir. Warp drive standing by.


541
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,411
Kirk.


542
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,790
If you do this, you'll never sit
in the captain's chair again.


543
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,959
-Warp speed.
-Aye, sir.


544
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,170
Warp speed.


545
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:03,511
Prepare for warp speed.
Stand by transwarp drive.


546
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,100
Transwarp at your command, sir.


547
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,476
Full power available.


548
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,811
Execute.


549
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,820
Full power available...


550
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,159
Engine room reports
full power available.


551
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:42,592
Transwarp drive, maximum velocity
in five, four, three, two, one.


552
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,977
Scotty, as good as your word.


553
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,605
Aye, sir.
The more they overthink the plumbing,


554
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,274
the easier it is to stop up the drain.


555
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,862
Here, Doctor,
souvenirs from one surgeon to another.


556
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,324
I took them out
of her main transwarp computer drive.


557
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,076
Nice of you to tell me in advance.


558
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,621
That's what you get
for missing staff meetings, Doctor.


559
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,915
Gentlemen, your work today
has been outstanding.


560
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,501
I intend to recommend
you all for promotion


561
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:20,671
In whatever fleet we end up serving.
Best speed to Genesis.


562
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,494
I am Saavik... Can you speak?


563
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,420
The Genesis wave.
His cells could have been regenerated.


564
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,594
Captain, this is Saavik.
Come in, please.


565
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,220
Yes, Saavik. Go ahead.


566
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,973
We have found the life sign.


567
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,144
It is a Vulcan child,
perhaps 8 to 10 Earth years of age.


568
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,105
A child? How did he get there?


569
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,483
It is Dr Marcus' opinion that this is...


570
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:09,697
That the Genesis effect
has in some way regenerated


571
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,365
Captain Spock.


572
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:21,208
Saavik, that's extraordinary.


573
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,419
What would you like to do next?


574
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,380
Request permission
to beam aboard immediately.


575
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,550
Saavik, does Dr Marcus think
there could be any chance


576
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:31,636
of radioactive contamination?


577
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,097
-No.
-None that he can detect, sir.


578
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,559
All the same, I'm going to advise
Starfleet and get instructions.


579
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,104
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.


580
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,273
Probably true,
but let's do it by the book.


581
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,942
Stand by on this channel. Go.


582
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,904
Starfleet Command,
this is U.S.S. Grissom


583
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,407
on subspace coded channel 98.8.
Come in, please.


584
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,418
Sir, something is jamming
our transmission, an energy surge.


585
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:05,920
I ocate.


586
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,591
Surge from astern, Captain.


587
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,222
Oh, my God.


588
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,523
Gunner: target engine only.


589
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,026
Captain, what is happening?


590
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,111
We're under attack!


591
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,696
Stand by for evasive.


592
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,955
I wanted prisoners!


593
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,291
A lucky shot sir...


594
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,801
Animal!


595
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,511
Sir, may I suggest...


596
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,304
Say the wrong thing, Torg.


597
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,224
If it's prisoners you want,
there are life signs on the planet.


598
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,143
Perhaps the very scientists you seek.


599
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,437
Saavik calling Grissom.
Come in, please.


600
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,855
Very good.


601
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,275
Grissom, this is Saavik
on emergency frequency.


602
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,985
Come in, please.


603
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,240
Saavik, what happened to them?


604
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:20,077
It would seem that Grissom
was destroyed by an enemy attack.


605
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,165
We must go.
They will soon come after us.


606
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,674
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours,
present speed.


607
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,637
-Can we hold speed, Scotty?
-Aye, she's got her second wind now.


608
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,973
Scan for vessels in pursuit.


609
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,976
Scanning.
Indications negative at this time.


610
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,902
Did I get it right?


611
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,863
Great, Bones. Just great.


612
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,772
It's time for total truth between us.


613
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:34,235
This planet is not what you intended
or hoped for, is it?


614
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,071
Not exactly.


615
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,198
Why?


616
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,994
I used protomatter
in the Genesis matrix.


617
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:45,913
Protomatter,


618
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:50,084
an unstable substance which every
ethical scientist in the galaxy


619
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,003
has denounced
as dangerously unpredictable.


620
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,923
But it was the only way
to solve certain problems.


621
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,927
S0, like your father,
you changed the rules.


622
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:05,266
If I hadn't,
it might have been years or never.


623
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,270
How many have paid the price
for your impatience?


624
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:13,107
How many have died?
How much damage have you done?


625
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,068
And what is yet to come?


626
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,821
Bridge, nothing happening here.


627
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,767
This planet's ageing in surges.


628
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,145
And Spock with it.
It seems they're joined together.


629
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:16,939
They are.


630
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,776
-How long?
-Days,


631
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,821
maybe hours.


632
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,783
I'm sorry.


633
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,581
It will be hardest on Spock.


634
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,794
Soon he will feel the burning
of his Vulcan blood.


635
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,671
I don't understand.


636
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,636
Vulcan males must endure it
every seventh year of their adult life.


637
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,355
Whoever they are,
they're getting closer.


638
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,940
-I'll go.
-No.


639
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,944
I'll do it. Give me your phaser.


640
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,957
Sir, Starfleet calling U.S.S. Grissom.
A warning about us.


641
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,959
Response?


642
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,129
Nothing, as before.


643
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:28,802
What's the Grissom up to?
Will she join us or will she fire on us?


644
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,348
Chekov, break silence.
Send Captain Esteban my compliments.


645
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,892
Aye, sir.


646
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,230
How are we doing?


647
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,316
How are we doing?


648
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,195
It's funny you should put it
quite that way, Jim.


649
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,946
We are doing fine,


650
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,283
but I'd feel safer
giving him one of my kidneys


651
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,452
than what's scrambled in my brain.


652
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:57,539
Admiral, there is no response
from Grissom on any channel.


653
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,169
Keep trying, Chekov,
at regular intervals.


654
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,735
So it has come.


655
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,831
It Is called Pon farr.


656
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,091
Will you trust me?


657
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:04,833
We are secured from warp speed.
Now entering Genesis Sector.


658
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,836
Proceed at impulse power.


659
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:25,646
-Vessel entering sector.
-Yes. Federation battle cruiser.


660
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,066
-Have they scanned us?
-Not yet.


661
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,819
Engage cloaking device.


662
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:00,264
I'd swear
there was something there, sir.


663
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,099
What did you see?


664
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,185
For an instant, a scout-class vessel.


665
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,191
Could be Grissom.
Patch in a hailing frequency.


666
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:18,365
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Please come in.


667
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,834
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Do you read?


668
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,337
Spock!


669
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,602
I've come a long way
for the power of Genesis


670
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,980
and what do I find?


671
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:52,941
A weakling human,


672
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,153
a Vulcan boy, and a woman.


673
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:59,406
My lord, we are survivors
of a doomed expedition.


674
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:04,244
This planet will destroy itself in hours.
The Genesis experiment is a failure.


675
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,912
A failure.


676
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,375
The most powerful,
destructive force ever created.


677
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:20,927
You will tell me the secret
of the Genesis torpedo.


678
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,972
I have no knowledge.


679
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,851
Then I hope
pain is something you enjoy.


680
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:34,649
I ordered no interruptions!


681
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,402
But, sir,
Federation starship approaching.


682
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,112
Bring me up.


683
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:41,239
Grissom,


684
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,618
this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?


685
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,624
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Please come in.


686
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,504
Battle Alert!


687
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,049
Grissom. This is Enterprise.


688
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:03,303
Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban
or Lieutenant Saavik. Please come in.


689
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,139
-Report status.
-We are cloaked.


690
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:10,143
Enemy closing on impulse power.
Range, 5,000 kellicams.


691
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:11,978
Good.


692
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,982
This is just the turn of luck
I have been waiting for.


693
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,534
Nothing on my scanner, sir.


694
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,953
Short-range scan, Mr Chekowv.


695
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,373
Put it on visual, Mr Sulu.


696
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,797
Range, 3,000 kellicams.


697
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:40,340
Steady.


698
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,510
Continue on impulse power.


699
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,516
Range, 2,000 kellicams.


700
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,854
Stand by to transfer energy to weapons.


701
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,607
At my command.


702
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,076
There.


703
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,954
That distortion. See it?


704
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,623
Yes, Sir.
It's getting larger as we close in.


705
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:16,001
Firing range, sir.


706
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:19,713
Gunner:


707
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,719
Target engine only - Understood?


708
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,389
Understood clearly, sir.


709
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,897
-Opinion, Mr Sulu.
-l think it's an energy surge.


710
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,648
Enough energy to hide a ship,
would you say?


711
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,400
A cloaking device.


712
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,028
-Red alert, Mr Scott.
-Aye, sir.


713
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,240
1,000 kellicams, closing.


714
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,910
-All power to the weapons systems.
-Aye, sir.


715
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:54,873
No shields?


716
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,211
If my guess is right, they'll have to
decloak before they can fire.


717
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,463
May all your guesses be right.


718
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:15,977
Klingon bird-of-prey, sir.


719
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,896
-She's arming torpedoes.
-Fire, Mr Scott.


720
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,282
Good shooting, Mr Scott.


721
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,665
-Precautionary, Mr Chekov. Shields up.
-Aye, sir.


722
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,131
Emergency power


723
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,801
to the thrusters!


724
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,764
Sir, the shield's nonresponsive.


725
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,268
-Scotty?
-The automation system's overloaded.


726
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,562
I didn't expect to take us into combat,
you know.


727
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,745
Emergency power.


728
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,290
Prepare to return fire.


729
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,251
Mr Scott, can you transfer power
to the phaser banks?


730
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,130
-l don't think so, sir.
-What happened?


731
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:27,007
Well, they've knocked out
the automation centre,


732
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,842
and I've got no control over anything.


733
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,218
Mr Sulu?


734
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,220
Nothing, sir.


735
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:40,186
S0, we're a sitting duck.


736
01:05:45,317 --> 01:05:47,444
Ready to fire emergency tube.


737
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,034
Why haven't they finished us?


738
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,786
-They outgun me 10 to one.
-My lord.


739
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,831
The enemy commander
wishes a truce to confer.


740
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,916
Put him onscreen.


741
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:08,506
This is Admiral James T. Kirk
of Federation Starship Enterprise.


742
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,218
So, the Genesis commander himself.


743
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,722
A violation of treaty between
the Federation and the Klingon Empire.


744
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,350
Your presence here is an act of war.


745
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:22,562
You have two minutes to surrender
your crew and your vessel,


746
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,231
or we will destroy you.


747
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,192
He's hiding something.


748
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,904
We may have dealt him
a more serious blow than I thought.


749
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,990
-How can you tell that?
-l trust my instincts.


750
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:38,203
Admiral Kirk,
this is your opponent speaking.


751
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,123
Do not lecture me
about treaty violations.


752
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,501
The Federation,
in creating an ultimate weapon,


753
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,545
has become a gang
of intergalactic criminals.


754
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,548
It is not I who will surrender. It is you!


755
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,685
On the planet below,


756
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,604
I have three prisoners


757
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,775
from the team who developed
your doomsday weapon.


758
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,114
If you do not surrender immediately,
I will execute them one at a time


759
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,116
as enemies of galactic peace!


760
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:19,285
Who is this?
How dare you take prisoners.


761
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:24,040
Who I am is not important.
That I have them is.


762
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,545
I will allow you to speak to them.


763
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,302
-Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
-Saavik.


764
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,638
Is David with you?


765
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,516
Yes, he is, and someone else,


766
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,476
a Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.


767
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,188
This


768
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:49,983
Vulcan,


769
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,778
IS he alive?


770
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,656
He is not himself, but he lives.


771
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,492
He is subject to rapid ageing,
like this unstable planet.


772
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,120
Hello, sir. It's David.


773
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,664
I'm sorry I'm late.


774
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:09,544
It's okay. I should've known you'd come.
Saavik's right. This planet is unstable.


775
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,296
It's gonna destroy itself
in a matter of hours.


776
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,339
David, what went wrong?


777
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,217
I went wrong.


778
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,844
I don't understand.


779
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:22,682
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender.
Genesis doesn't work.


780
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:25,185
I can't believe they'd kill us for it.


781
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:28,980
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken.
I meant what I said.


782
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,609
And now to show
that my intentions are sincere,


783
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,527
I shall kill one of the prisoners.


784
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,863
Wait a minute!
Give me a chance to talk...


785
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,364
Kill one of them.


786
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:40,867
I don't care which.


787
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:22,951
Saavik?


788
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,914
David?


789
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:34,504
Admiral, David is dead.


790
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,810
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.


791
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,778
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son!


792
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,291
You Klingon bastard.


793
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,628
There are two more prisoners, Admiral.


794
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,840
Do you want them killed, too?


795
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,718
Surrender your vessel.


796
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,266
All right. All right, damn you.


797
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:31,978
All right.


798
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,861
Give me a minute to inform my crew.


799
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:44,198
I give two minutes
for you and your gallant crew.


800
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:58,004
Take every last man.
Form a boarding party, armed heauvily.


801
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,965
-They outnumber us, my lord.
-We are Klingons!


802
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,802
Once you control the ship,
we will transfer our flag there


803
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,847
and take Genesis from their
own memory banks.


804
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:22,111
Mr Sulu, what is the crew complement
of a bird-of-prey?


805
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,530
About a dozen officers and men.


806
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,826
With some of them on the planet.


807
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,707
I swear to you, we're not finished yet.


808
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,210
Bones, you and Sulu
to the Transporter Room.


809
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,213
The rest of you with me.
We have a job to do.


810
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,676
Commander, Klingon vessel.


811
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,887
Prepare to board this ship
on my next signal.


812
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,223
No tricks, Kirk.


813
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,517
You have one minute.


814
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:55,019
No tricks.


815
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,564
I'm looking forward to meeting you.


816
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:03,736
To the transport room.


817
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,488
Success!


818
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,667
Computer,
this is Admiral James T. Kirk.


819
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,752
Request security access.


820
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,925
Computer, destruct sequence one,


821
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,261
code one, one, A.


822
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,728
Computer,
Commander Montgomery Scott,


823
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,564
chief engineering officer.


824
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:45,361
Destruct sequence two,
code one, one, A, two, B.


825
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,037
Computer,
this is Commander Pavel Chekov,


826
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,039
acting science officer.


827
01:12:56,456 --> 01:13:03,337
Destruct sequence three,
code one, B, two, B, three.


828
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:07,175
Destruct sequence
completed and engaged.


829
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,678
Awaliting final code
for one-minute countdown.


830
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:14,599
Code zero, zero, zero,


831
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:17,852
destruct,


832
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:19,687
Zero.


833
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,192
Destruct sequence is activated.


834
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,870
Kirk, your time runs out.


835
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,082
-All set?
-Aye, sir.


836
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,294
Commander, Klingon vessel.


837
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:46,005
We are energising
transporter beam now.


838
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,008
Transporter, stand by.


839
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,391
My lord,
the ship appears to be deserted.


840
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,686
How can that be? They're hiding.


841
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:45,481
Yes, sir, but the Bridge
seems to be run by computer.


842
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,108
It is the only thing speaking.


843
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,486
Speaking? Let me hear.


844
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,324
Nine, eight, seven, six,


845
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,160
five...


846
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:00,121
-Get out! Get out of there!
-...three, two...


847
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:01,414
-Get out!
-...onhe.


848
01:15:57,053 --> 01:16:00,640
My God, Bones, what have I done?


849
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,644
What you had to do.
What you always do.


850
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,522
Turn death into a fighting chance to live.


851
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:16,155
Planet core readings.
Unstable, changing rapidly.


852
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,576
What about surface life signs?


853
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:22,662
There.


854
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,712
No, don't touch him.


855
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:06,515
Bones.


856
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,640
-What happened?
-He gave his life to save us.


857
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:57,149
Rapid ageing.
All genetic functions highly accelerated.


858
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:00,486
-What about his mind?
-His mind's a void.


859
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,156
It seems, Admiral,
that I've got all his marbles.


860
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,742
Is there anything we can do?


861
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:09,620
Only one thing, sir.
Get him off this planet.


862
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,456
His ageing is part
of what's going on around us.


863
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,861
Klingon Commander,
this is Admiral James T. Kirk.


864
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,488
I'm alive and well on the planet surface.


865
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,283
I know this will come
as a pleasant surprise to you,


866
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:50,035
but our ship was a victim
of an unfortunate accident.


867
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:55,541
Sorry about your crew,
but as we say on Earth, c'est /a vie.


868
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,880
I have what you want.


869
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,842
I have the secret of Genesis.


870
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:09,763
You're gonna have to bring us up there
to get it.


871
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,391
You hear me?


872
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,855
I'm waiting for you.


873
01:20:19,857 --> 01:20:21,609
What is your answer?


874
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,084
Drop all weapons!


875
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:46,091
Over there. All but Kirk.


876
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,353
Maltz,


877
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,313
prisoners are at beam coordinates.


878
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,107
-You should take the Vulcan, too.
-No!


879
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,277
-But why?
-Because you wish it.


880
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,492
Maltz - activate beam!


881
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,752
Genesis. I want it!


882
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:27,007
Beam the Vulcan up and we'll talk.


883
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:31,011
Give me what I want and I'll consider it.


884
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:34,890
You fool, look around you!
The planet's destroying itself!


885
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,351
Yes, exhilarating, isn't it?


886
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,313
If we don't help each other,
we'll die here.


887
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:44,608
Perfect. Then that's the way it shall be.


888
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,294
Give me Genesis.


889
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,191
Give me your hand.


890
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:21,413
I have had enough of you!


891
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,030
Maltz!


892
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:04,683
Don't. How many more?


893
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,185
Just him, sir.


894
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,936
Bones, help Spock.


895
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,856
We've got to break out of orbit.


896
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:16,153
-You, help us or die.
-] do not deserve to live.


897
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,197
Fine. I'll kill you later.


898
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,032
Let's get out of here.


899
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,629
Where's the damn antimatter inducer?


900
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:36,423
This? No, this.


901
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:39,927
That or nothing.


902
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:49,228
If I read this right, sir,
we have full power.


903
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,854
Go, Sulu.


904
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:06,912
Goodbye, David.


905
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:10,874
We are clear and free to navigate.


906
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:14,169
Best speed to Vulcan.
Mr Chekov, take the prisoner below.


907
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:17,381
-Aye, sir.
-Wait. You said you would kill me.


908
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,258
I lied.


909
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:27,850
Spock,


910
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,395
for God sakes, talk to me.


911
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,650
You stuck this damn thing
in my head, remember?


912
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:39,695
Remember?


913
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,449
Now tell me what to do with it.


914
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,078
Help me.


915
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:09,725
I'm gonna tell you something that I


916
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,770
never thought I'd ever hear myself say.


917
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,734
But it seems I've missed you,


918
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,909
and I don't know If I could stand
to lose you again.


919
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,181
Ambassador, they are on approach.
They're requesting permission to land.


920
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:57,230
Permission granted. Tell them...
Tell Kirk we'll be ready.


921
01:28:04,655 --> 01:28:07,074
Mr Sulu, you're on manual.


922
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,328
It's been a while, sir. Here we go.


923
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,550
Retrothrusters.


924
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,348
Sarek is waiting above, sir.


925
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,829
Sarek,


926
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:21,666
child of Skon,


927
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:24,127
child of Solkar,


928
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,174
the body of your son breathes still.


929
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,428
What is your wish?


930
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:36,515
I ask for fal-tor-pan,


931
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,184
the refusion.


932
01:30:40,644 --> 01:30:43,897
What you seek has not
been done since ages past,


933
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:46,817
and then, only in legend.


934
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:52,280
-Your request is not logical.
-Forgive me, T'Lar.


935
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:57,536
My logic is uncertain


936
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,664
where my son is concerned.


937
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,584
Who is the keeper of the katra?


938
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,296
I am.


939
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:12,717
McCoy, Leonard H., son of David.


940
01:31:13,552 --> 01:31:15,345
McCoy, son of David,


941
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,223
since thou art human,


942
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:22,477
we cannot expect thee to understand
fully what Sarek has requested.


943
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,230
Spock's body lives.


944
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:29,234
With your approval,
we shall use all our powers


945
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,196
to return to his body
that which you possess.


946
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,910
But, McCoy, you must now be warned.


947
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:45,250
The danger to thyself is as grave
as the danger to Spock.


948
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,506
You must make the choice.


949
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,678
I choose the danger.


950
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:01,266
Hell of a time to ask.


951
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:14,876
I'm all right, Jim.


952
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,963
What about Spock?


953
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,300
Only time will answer.


954
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:27,138
Kirk,


955
01:35:27,764 --> 01:35:29,140
I thank you.


956
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:32,143
-What you have done is...
-What I have done,


957
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,978
I had to do.


958
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,817
But at what cost? Your ship, your son.


959
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:44,823
If I hadn't tried,
the cost would've been my soul.


960
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:26,216
My father says
that you have been my friend.


961
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:29,177
You came back for me.


962
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,223
You would have done the same for me.


963
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:38,019
Why would you do this?


964
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,108
Because the needs of the one


965
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,612
outweigh the needs of the many.


966
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:10,802
I have been,


967
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:13,471
and ever shall be,


968
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,307
your friend.


969
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:17,767
Yes.


970
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:20,478
Yes, Spock.


971
01:38:22,272 --> 01:38:23,648
The ship.


972
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:27,151
-Out of danger?
-You saved the ship.


973
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:31,489
You saved us all. Don't you remember?


974
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:46,337
Jim.


975
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,217
Your name is Jim.


976
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:54,345
Yes.
