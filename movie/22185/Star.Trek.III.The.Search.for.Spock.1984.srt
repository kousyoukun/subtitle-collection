0
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,634
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,836
It is logical.

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,354
The needs of the many outweigh...

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,076
...the needs of the few.

4
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,479
Or the one.

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,550
I have been and always
shall be your friend.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,159
Live long and prosper.

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,238
We are assembled here today to pay
final respects to our honoured dead.

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,197
This death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,630
the sunrise of a new world.

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,515
A world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,231
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one.

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,233
Of my friend, I can only say this:

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,799
Of all the souls I have encountered
in my travels,

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,956
his was the most...

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,918
...human.

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,914
Honours. Hup!

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,069
Space, the final frontier.

18
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,036
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,075
Her ongoing mission
to explore strange new worlds.

20
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,638
To seek out new lifeforms
and new civilisations.

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,876
To boldly go...

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,517
...where no man has gone before.

23
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,357
USS Enterprise,
Captain's Personal Log.

24
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,513
With most of our battle damage
repaired, we're almost home.

25
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,679
Yet I feel uneasy.
And I wonder why.

26
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,356
Perhaps it is the emptiness
of this vessel.

27
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,871
Most of our trainee crew
has been reassigned.

28
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,911
Lieutenant Saavik
and my son David

29
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,510
are exploring the Genesis planet,
which he helped create.

30
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,111
And Enterprise feels like a house
with all the children gone.

31
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,630
No, more empty even than that.

32
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,635
The death of Spock
is like an open wound.

33
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,630
It seems that I've left the noblest
part of myself back there...

34
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,876
...on that newborn planet.

35
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,869
- Status, Mr Sulu.
- On course, Admiral.

36
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,594
Estimating space dock in 2.1 hours.

37
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,598
Very well. Mr Chekov,
I'll need a pre-approach scan.

38
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,156
- Take the science station, please.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,639
Uhura... Any response from Starfleet
on our Project Genesis enquiries?

40
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,958
- No, sir, there is no response.
- That's very odd.

41
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,759
- Scotty, progress report.
- It's almost done, sir.

42
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,269
You'll be fully automated
by the time we dock.

43
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,032
Excellent timing. You fixed the barn
door after the horse has come home.

44
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,549
How much refit time
till we can take her out again?

45
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,275
Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have
eight weeks, so I'll do it in two.

46
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,551
Have you always multiplied your
repair estimates by a factor of four?

47
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,312
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep
my reputation as a miracle worker?

48
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,750
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.

49
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,550
Mr Sulu, take the Con.
I'll be in my quarters.

50
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,312
Sir?

51
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,591
Are they planning a ceremony
when we get in?

52
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,315
- I mean, a reception?
- Would you like a hero's welcome?

53
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,033
Well, God knows there should be.

54
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,835
This time we've paid for the party
with our dearest blood.

55
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,799
Steady. Steady, boys.

56
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,436
Keep scanning.

57
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,755
I thought you people were reliable.
Where the hell is he?

58
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,238
He's been here for some time.
Put me on hailing frequency.

59
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,354
Commander Kruge...
This is Valkris.

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,869
I have purchased the Genesis data.
Ready to transmit.

61
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,075
Well done, Valkris.

62
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,794
What the hell is...

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,309
Disengage cloaking device!

64
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,115
Transmit data. Now!

65
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,273
Transmission completed.

66
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,996
You will find it useful.

67
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,791
Then you have seen it?

68
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,159
I have, my Lord.

69
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,155
Unfortunate.

70
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,316
Understood.

71
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,276
Thrusters.

72
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,477
What the hell's going on?
When do I get paid off?

73
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,194
Soon, Captain. Quite soon.

74
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,075
Success, my Lord... and my love.

75
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,475
You will be remembered with honour.

76
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,558
Fire!

77
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,909
New course. Federation neutral zone.

78
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,596
Feed him!

79
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,756
Yes, my Lord.

80
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,472
Approach Control, this is Enterprise,
ready for docking manoeuvre.

81
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,752
- Enterprise is cleared to dock.
- Lock on.

82
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,149
Systems locked.

83
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,637
- Spacedock, you have control.
- Affirmative, Enterprise.

84
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,469
- Enjoy the ride, and welcome home.
- Enterprise confirms.

85
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,239
Acknowledge, doors closed.

86
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,556
Would you look at that!

87
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,389
My friends, the great experiment.

88
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,398
The Excelsior. Ready for trial runs.

89
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,515
She's supposed to have
transwarp drive.

90
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,352
And if my grandmother had wheels,
she'd be a wagon.

91
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,236
Young minds, fresh ideas.
Be tolerant, Mr Scott.

92
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,114
Standby umbilical
and gravitational support systems.

93
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,278
Aye, sir, moorings activated,
all systems standing by.

94
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,869
- Admiral. This is not possible.
- Mr Chekov.

95
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,268
An energy reading from 'C' deck,
from inside Mr Spock's quarters.

96
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,669
- I ordered Spock's quarters sealed.
- I sealed the room myself!

97
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,269
Nevertheless, I am reading
a lifeform there.

98
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,715
This entire crew seems on the edge of
obsessive behaviour regarding Spock.

99
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,876
Sir, Security reports the door
to Spock's quarters has been forced.

100
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,516
I'm on my way.
Sulu, continue docking procedures.

101
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,598
Jim...

102
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,596
Help me.

103
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,594
You left me on Genesis.
Why did you do that?

104
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,756
Help me.

105
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,231
Bones!

106
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,154
What the hell are you doing?

107
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,590
Have you lost your mind?

108
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,315
Help me, Jim. Take me home.

109
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,638
Bones, we are. We are home.

110
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,835
Then perhaps it's not too late.

111
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,429
Climb the steps, Jim.

112
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,200
Climb the steps of Mount Seleya.

113
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,236
Mount Seleya?

114
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,679
Bones, Mount Seleya's on Vulcan.
We're home... on Earth.

115
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,238
Remember.

116
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,671
Admiral, docking is completed.

117
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,190
Starfleet Commander Morrow
is on his way for inspection.

118
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,837
Uhura, get the medics down here!
Get them now!

119
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,119
You've all done remarkable service
under the most difficult conditions.

120
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,153
You'll be receiving
Starfleet's highest commendation.

121
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,830
And more importantly...
extended shore leave.

122
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,158
All but you, Mr Scott. They need
your wisdom on the new Excelsior.

123
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,352
Report there tomorrow
as Captain of Engineering.

124
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,315
With all appreciation, I'd prefer
to supervise the refit of Enterprise.

125
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,671
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.

126
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,154
But, sir...

127
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,909
I'm sorry, Mr Scott,
but there will be no refit.

128
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,229
Admiral... I don't understand.
The Enterprise is not...

129
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,310
Jim, the Enterprise is 20 years old.
We feel her day is over.

130
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,715
But we had requested...

131
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,913
We had hoped to take her
back to Genesis.

132
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,918
- That is out of the question.
- May I ask why?

133
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,318
In your absence, Genesis has become
a galactic controversy.

134
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,870
Until the Federation Council
makes policy,

135
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,436
you are all under orders
not to discuss with anyone

136
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,915
your knowledge of Genesis.

137
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,194
Consider it a quarantine planet...
and a forbidden subject.

138
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,998
To understand the events on which
I report, it is necessary to review

139
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,475
the theoretical data
on the Genesis device,

140
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,319
as developed by Doctors Carol
and David Marcus.

141
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,479
Genesis, simply put,
is life from lifelessness.

142
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,309
The device was to be introduced
into a pre-selected area

143
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,991
of a lifeless space body,
a moon or other dead form.

144
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,796
The device would instantaneously
cause the Genesis efect.

145
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,312
Instead of a dead moon, a living,
breathing planet now exists,

146
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,640
capable of sustaining whatever life
forms we see fit to deposit on it.

147
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,958
So?

148
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,274
Speak.

149
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,549
Great power to control, dominate.

150
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,598
- Speak.
- Impressive.

151
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,234
They can make a planet.

152
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,557
Oh, yes. New cities,
homes in the country.

153
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,718
Your woman at your side,
children playing at your feet.

154
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,391
And overhead, fluttering in the
breeze, the flag of the Federation!

155
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,113
Charming.

156
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,231
- Station.
- Yes, my Lord.

157
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,799
- Share this with no one.
- Understood, my Lord.

158
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,354
We are going to this planet.

159
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,076
Even as our emissaries negotiate
for peace with the Federation,

160
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,317
we will act for the preservation
of our race.

161
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,590
We will seize the secret
of this weapon.

162
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,314
The secret of ultimate power!

163
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,511
Success, my Lord.

164
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,668
We have reached the destination
planet at point 035.

165
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,553
Very well, Lieutenant. Helm.

166
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,148
Execute standard orbital approach.

167
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,593
Send a coded message for
Starfleet Commander, Priority One.

168
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,475
"Federation science vessel Grissom
arriving Genesis, Mutara Sector,"

169
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,356
"to begin research.
J.T. Esteban commanding."

170
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,435
Dr Marcus, it's your planet.

171
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,036
Begin scanning, please.

172
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,072
This is where the fun begins, Saavik.

173
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,033
Just like your father, so human.

174
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,152
All units functional.
Recorders are on. Scanning Sector 1.

175
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,429
The foliage in fully developed state
of growth. Temperature 22.2 Celsius.

176
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,231
Sector 2 indicating desert terrain.
Minimal vegetation. Temperature 39.4.

177
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,638
Sector 3, sub-tropical vegetation.

178
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,638
Temperature decreasing rapidly.

179
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,998
It's snow.
Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!

180
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,633
Fascinating.

181
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,436
All the varieties of land and weather
known to Earth, within hours' walk.

182
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,189
- Metallic mass.
- Close range scan.

183
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,272
A photon tube.

184
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,189
Gravitational fields were in flux.
It must have soft landed.

185
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,072
In code to Starfleet:

186
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,032
"Captain Spock's tube located
on Genesis surface."

187
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,316
I don't believe it.

188
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,191
What is it?

189
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,076
If equipment is functioning properly,
indications are an animal lifeform.

190
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,794
- You said there wouldn't be any.
- There shouldn't be.

191
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,278
Cross referenced and verified.
An unidentifiable lifeform reading.

192
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,228
You wish to advise Starfleet, sir?

193
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,159
We don't know
what we're talking about here.

194
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,351
- Why don't we beam it up?
- Oh, no.

195
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,711
Regulations state,
"Nothing shall be beamed aboard"

196
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,275
"until danger of contamination
is eliminated."

197
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,837
Captain, beaming down
to the surface is permitted.

198
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,591
If the Captain decides that the
mission is vital and reasonably safe.

199
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,191
- Please, we must see what it is.
- Or who.

200
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,590
Absent friends.

201
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,270
Admiral, what's going to happen
to the Enterprise?

202
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,438
- She's to be decommissioned.
- Will we get another ship?

203
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,351
I can't get an answer. Starfleet's up
to its brass in galactic conference.

204
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,233
No one has time for those
who stand and wait.

205
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,432
Sir, about Dr McCoy, how is he?

206
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,555
He's home, resting comfortably,
pumped full of tranquilizers.

207
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,912
They say it's exhaustion. He promised
he'd stay put. We'll see.

208
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,792
Ah, Mr Scott.

209
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,831
Come.

210
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,796
Sarek!

211
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,550
Ambassador, I had no idea you were
here. I believe you know my crew.

212
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,439
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

213
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,710
Please excuse us.

214
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,950
Ambassador, I would have come to
Vulcan to express my deep sympathy.

215
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,596
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk.
I have been to your Government.

216
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,759
I have seen the Genesis information,
and your own report.

217
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,951
Then you know how bravely
your son met his death.

218
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,355
Why did you leave him on Genesis?

219
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,439
Spock trusted you.
And you denied him his future.

220
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,398
- I saw no future.
- Only his body was in death, Kirk.

221
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,115
And you were the last one
to be with him.

222
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,073
Then you must know that you should
have come with him to Vulcan.

223
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,989
- But why?
- Because he asked you to!

224
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,156
He entrusted you...

225
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,315
...with his very essence, with
everything that was not of the body!

226
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,035
He asked you to bring him to us.

227
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,598
And to bring that which he gave you:
His Katra. His living spirit.

228
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,596
Sir...

229
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,955
Your son meant more to me
than you can know.

230
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,639
I'd have given my life if it would
have saved his.

231
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,276
Believe me when I tell you...
he made no request of me.

232
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,869
He would not have
spoken of it openly.

233
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,596
Then how was...

234
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,112
I must have your thoughts.
May I join your mind?

235
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,077
Certainly.

236
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,789
He spoke of your friendship.

237
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,759
Yes.

238
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,909
He... asked you not to grieve.

239
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,155
Yes.

240
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,796
The needs of the many...

241
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,554
...outweigh...

242
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,956
...the needs of the few...

243
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,114
...or the one.

244
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,838
Spock...

245
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,356
I have been...

246
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,268
...and always shall be your friend.

247
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,628
Live long and prosper.

248
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,313
No.

249
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,836
Forgive me.

250
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,116
It is not here.

251
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,668
I had assumed
he mind-melded with you.

252
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,158
It is the Vulcan way...
when the body's end is near.

253
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,670
We were separated.

254
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,870
He couldn't touch me.

255
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,275
I see.

256
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,358
Then everything that he was...

257
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,068
...everything he knew...

258
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,714
...is lost.

259
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,994
Please wait.

260
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,110
He would have found a way.
If there was that much at stake,

261
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,356
Spock would have found a way.

262
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,917
Yes. But how?

263
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,594
What if he joined with someone else?

264
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,910
Engine Room, Flight Recorder
Visual. Star date 8128. 78.

265
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,394
Go.

266
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,428
Ship... out of danger?

267
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,153
Yes.

268
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,430
Back, 0.77.

269
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,230
Flight Recorder Visual, 28. 77.

270
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,589
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment!

271
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,439
- He'll die.
- Captain! He's dead already.

272
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,554
Back, 0.76.

273
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,873
Flight Recorder Visual, 28. 76.

274
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,315
- You're not going in there!
- Perhaps you're right.

275
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,557
- What is Mr Scott's condition?
- I don't think that he...

276
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,230
Sorry, Doctor, I have no time
to discuss this logically.

277
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,154
Freeze.

278
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,430
Repeat... and augment.

279
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,155
Remember...

280
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,794
McCoy!

281
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,109
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.

282
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,831
What must I do?

283
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,918
You must bring them
to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.

284
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,351
Only there can both find peace.

285
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,316
What you ask...

286
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,154
...is difficult.

287
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,356
You will find a way, Kirk.

288
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,353
If you honour them both, you must.

289
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,716
I will.

290
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,796
I swear.

291
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,397
Transporter Room,
stand by to energise.

292
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,511
Aye, sir, energising now.

293
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,789
Grissom to Saavik. We're picking up
radiation from the lifeform.

294
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,438
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings
are well below danger level.

295
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,756
Exercise caution, Lieutenant.

296
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,714
This landing is Captain's discretion,
and I'm the one who's out on a limb.

297
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,073
I'll try to remember that.

298
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,592
There are your lifeforms. These were
microbes on the tube's surface.

299
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,830
We shot them here from Enterprise.
They were fruitful and multiplied.

300
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,998
But how could they have
evolved so quickly?

301
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,877
Saavik...

302
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,591
What is it?

303
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,756
Spock's burial robe.

304
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,479
No, absolutely not, Jim.
You're my best officer.

305
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,758
But I am Commander, Starfleet,
so I don't break rules.

306
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,636
Don't quote rules to me. I'm talking
about loyalty and sacrifice.

307
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,072
One man who's died for us, another
with deep emotional problems.

308
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,953
This business
about Spock and McCoy...

309
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,835
Honestly, I never understood
Vulcan mysticism.

310
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,352
You don't have to believe.
I'm not even sure that I believe.

311
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,076
But if there's even a chance
that Spock has an eternal soul...

312
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,158
...then it's my responsibility.
- Yours?

313
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,917
As surely as if it were my very own.

314
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,473
Give me back the Enterprise.
With Scotty's help I could...

315
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,116
The Enterprise would never stand
the pounding, and you know it!

316
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,598
- Then I'll hire a ship.
- Out of the question, my friend.

317
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,271
The Council has ordered that no one
but the science team goes to Genesis.

318
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,828
Your life and your career stand for
rationality, not intellectual chaos.

319
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,032
Keep up this emotional behaviour
and you'll lose everything.

320
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,835
You'll destroy yourself.
Do you understand me, Jim?

321
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,797
I hear you.

322
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,872
I had to try.

323
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,911
Of course.

324
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,111
- Thanks for the drink.
- Any time.

325
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,394
- The word, sir?
- The word...

326
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,795
...is no.
I am therefore going anyway.

327
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,152
- You can count on our help, sir.
- Shall I alert Dr McCoy?

328
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,477
Please. He has a long journey
ahead of him.

329
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,155
Long time, Doc.

330
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,954
Yeah. Anybody been looking for me?

331
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,594
I have, but what's the use?
What'll it be?

332
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,550
- Altair water.
- That's not your usual poison.

333
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,998
To expect one to order poison
in a bar is not logical.

334
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,314
Got it.

335
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,709
To your planet, welcome.

336
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,953
- I think that's my line, stranger.
- Oh, forgive.

337
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,952
I here am new. But you are known,
being McCoy from Enterprise.

338
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,916
- You have me at a disadvantage, sir.
- I name not important.

339
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,113
You seek I. Message received.

340
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,914
Available ship stands by.

341
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,118
How much and how soon?

342
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,916
How soon is now. How much is where.

343
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,354
- Somewhere in the Mutara Sector.
- Oh, Mutara restricted!

344
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,519
Take permits many. Money more.

345
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,712
There aren't going to be
any damn permits!

346
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,151
How can you get a permit
to do a damn illegal thing?

347
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,069
Look... Price you name, money I got!

348
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,718
Place you name, money I name,
otherwise bargain, no.

349
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,994
All right, dammit! Genesis. The name
of the place we're going is Genesis!

350
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,519
Genesis?!

351
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,273
Yes, Genesis! How can you be deaf
with ears like that?

352
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,393
Genesis allowed is not!
It's planet forbidden!

353
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,435
Look, my backward friend. Genesis
may be planet forbidden, but I'm...

354
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,233
Sir, I'm sorry. You don't want to be
discussing this subject in public.

355
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,432
I'll discuss what I like!
And who in the hell are you?!

356
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,471
Would you like
a ride home, Dr McCoy?

357
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,596
If I wanted a ride home, would I
be trying to charter a space flight?

358
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,160
How in the hell
do you know who I am?

359
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,635
Federation Security, sir.

360
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,956
You're gonna get
a nice long rest, Doctor.

361
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,117
Saavik to Grissom. We are definitely
reading a second lifeform.

362
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,552
We concur.
Proceed with caution, Saavik.

363
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,748
What the hell is going on down there?

364
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,029
Be quick, Admiral. They're moving
him to the Federation 'Funny Farm'.

365
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,279
Yes, poor friend.
I hear he's fruity as a nutcake.

366
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,754
Two minutes.

367
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,398
Jim!

368
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,149
- How many fingers do I have up?
- That's not very damn funny.

369
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,319
- Your sense of humour has returned.
- The hell it has. What's that?

370
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,080
- Lexorin.
- Lexorin? What for?

371
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,594
You're suffering from
a Vulcan mind-meld, Doctor.

372
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,557
That green-blooded son-of-a-bitch.

373
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,116
It's his revenge for
all those arguments he lost.

374
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,552
Let me see your hand. This will
make you well enough to travel.

375
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,076
- Where's Admiral Kirk?
- With the prisoner.

376
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,558
Get him quickly. Commander,
Starfleet, wants him right away.

377
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,473
Keeping you busy?

378
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,152
Don't get smart, Tiny.

379
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,269
- Admiral, Starfleet...
- This man's sick. Look.

380
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,351
Side elevator.
Agents on their way up.

381
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,754
Don't call me Tiny.

382
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,798
Unit Two, this is unit One.

383
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,151
The Koyabashi Maru has set sail
for the promised land.

384
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,194
Message acknowledged.
All units will be informed.

385
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,994
You're taking me
to the promised land?

386
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,156
What are friends for?

387
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,396
Mr Scott... Calling it a night?

388
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,352
- Yes, sir.
- Turning in myself.

389
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,236
Looking forward to breaking some of
Enterprise's speed records tomorrow.

390
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,271
Good night.

391
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,630
- Level, please.
- Transporter Room.

392
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,354
- Thank you.
- Up your shaft!

393
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,870
Roger, Old City Station
at 22.00 hours. All is well.

394
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,957
Understood. All stations clear.

395
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,594
You amaze me, Commander.

396
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,793
A 20-year space veteran, you choose
the worst duty station in town.

397
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,754
I mean, look at this place!
This is the hind end of space.

398
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,315
Peace and quiet appeals to me,
Lieutenant.

399
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,150
Maybe that's okay for someone like
you, whose career is winding down.

400
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,069
But me, I need some challenge
in my life, adventure.

401
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,078
Maybe even just a surprise or two.

402
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,955
Well, you know what they say.
Be careful what you wish for.

403
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,559
You may get it.

404
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,714
Good evening, Commander.
Is everything ready?

405
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,309
Step into my parlour, gentlemen.

406
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,195
- That's Admiral Kirk, my God.
- Very good for you, Lieutenant.

407
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,473
But it's damn irregular. No
destination orders, no encoded IDs.

408
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,875
- All true.
- What are we going to do about it?

409
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,359
I'm not going to do anything, but
you're going to sit in the closet.

410
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,597
Have you lost
all your sense of reality?

411
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,756
This isn't reality.

412
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,470
This is fantasy.
You wanted adventure, how's this?

413
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,035
The old adrenalin going, huh?
Good boy.

414
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,674
Now get in the closet.

415
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,672
- Go on. Go on!
- I'll just get in the closet.

416
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,114
Okay!

417
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,518
- I'm glad you're on our side.
- Can you handle that?

418
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,553
I'll have Mr Adventure
eating out of my hand, sir.

419
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,150
And I'll see all of you
at the rendezvous. And Admiral...

420
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,394
All my hopes.

421
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,593
As promised, she's all yours, sir.
All systems automated and ready.

422
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,633
A chimpanzee and two trainees
could run her.

423
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,230
Thank you, Mr Scott.
I'll try not to take that personally.

424
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,835
My friends, I can't ask you
to go any further.

425
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,032
Dr McCoy and I have to do this.
The rest of you do not.

426
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,152
Admiral, we're losing precious time.

427
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,353
- What course, please, Admiral?
- Mr Scott?

428
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,438
I'd be grateful, Admiral,
if you'd give the word.

429
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,038
Gentlemen... May the wind be
at our backs. Stations, please.

430
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,994
- Engage auto systems.
- Aye. Engaged.

431
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,509
- Clear all moorings.
- Cleared, sir.

432
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,554
- One quarter impulse power.
- One quarter impulse.

433
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,795
Commander, Starfleet,
on emergency channel.

434
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,150
He orders you
to surrender this vessel.

435
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,318
No reply, Chekov.
Steady as she goes, Sulu.

436
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,630
Yellow Alert.
Captain to the bridge.

437
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,476
This is the Captain. How can you have
a Yellow Alert in spacedock?

438
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,877
Sir, someone is stealing
the Enterprise.

439
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,756
I'm on my way.

440
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,669
Yellow Alert.
All stations, Yellow Alert.

441
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,316
Yellow Alert.
All stations, Yellow Alert.

442
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,950
One minute to spacedoors.

443
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,709
- Are you gonna walk through them?
- Calm yourself.

444
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,396
Sir. Excelsior powering up
with orders to pursue.

445
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,874
Yellow Alert.

446
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,553
Status.

447
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,309
All automates ready and functioning.
Automatic moorings retracted.

448
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,193
All speeds available
through Transwarp Drive.

449
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,356
Incredible machine.

450
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,235
Helm. One quarter impulse power.

451
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,550
Thirty seconds to spacedoors.

452
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,752
Warning, secured spacedoors.

453
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,349
Warning, secured spacedoors.

454
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,996
- And now, Mr Scott.
- Sir?

455
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,397
- The doors, Mr Scott!
- Aye, sir, I'm workin' on it.

456
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,917
Danger, spacedoors are closed.
Danger.

457
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,352
We have cleared spacedoors.

458
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,069
- Full impulse power.
- Aye, sir.

459
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,276
- Standby tractor beam.
- Tractor beam, on.

460
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,439
If he tries to get away
with Warp Drive, he's in for a shock.

461
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,395
Excelsior closing
to 4,000 metres, sir.

462
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,195
- We'll need everything you have.
- Warp Drive standing by.

463
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,039
Kirk...

464
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,915
If you do this, you'll never sit
in the Captain's chair again.

465
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,113
- Warp Speed.
- Aye, sir. Warp Speed.

466
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,515
Prepare for Warp Speed.
Stand by Transwarp Drive.

467
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,598
- Transwarp at your command.
- Full power available.

468
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,631
Execute.

469
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,877
...power available.

470
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,071
Full power available.

471
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,595
Transwarp Drive, maximum velocity
in five, four, three, two, one.

472
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,153
Scotty, as good as your word.

473
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,433
The more they overtake the plumbing,
the easier to stop up the drain.

474
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,838
Here, Doctor, souvenirs
from one surgeon to another.

475
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,350
I took them out of
her main Transwarp computer drive.

476
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,236
- Nice of you to tell me in advance.
- You missed the staff meeting.

477
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,476
Your work today
has been outstanding.

478
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,875
I will recommend you all
for promotion...

479
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,312
...in whatever fleet we end up
serving. Best speed to Genesis.

480
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,275
I am Saavik. Can you speak?

481
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,715
The Genesis Wave. His cells
could have been regenerated.

482
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,237
Captain, this is Saavik.
Come in, please.

483
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,399
- Yes, Saavik, go ahead.
- We have found the life sign.

484
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,639
It is a Vulcan child, perhaps eight
to ten Earth years of age.

485
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,752
- A child?! How did he get there?
- It is Dr Marcus' opinion that...

486
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,116
...that the Genesis effect has in some
way regenerated... Captain Spock.

487
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,680
Saavik, that's... extraordinary.
What would you like to do next?

488
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,920
Request permission
to beam aboard immediately.

489
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,557
Does Dr Marcus think there's any
chance of radioactive contamination?

490
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,235
- No.
- None that he can detect, sir.

491
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,876
I'm going to advise Starfleet
and get instructions.

492
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,710
- I'm sure Starfleet would approve.
- But let's do it by the book.

493
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,158
Standby on this channel. Go.

494
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,672
Starfleet Command, this is
USS Grissom on coded channel 98.8.

495
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,632
Come in, please.

496
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,115
Sir, something is jamming
our transmission. An energy surge.

497
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,912
Locate!

498
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,953
Sir, it's from astern!

499
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,434
Oh, my God.

500
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,031
Gunner... Target engine only.

501
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,633
- Captain, what is happening?
- We're under attack!

502
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,159
Stand by for evasive.

503
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,713
Fire.

504
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,559
I wanted prisoners!

505
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,830
A lucky shot, sir...

506
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,394
Animal!

507
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,512
- Sir, may I suggest...
- Say the wrong thing, Torg!

508
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,350
There are life signs on the planet.
Perhaps the very scientists you seek.

509
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,791
- Saavik calling Grissom...
- Very good.

510
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,076
Grissom, this is Saavik on emergency
frequency. Come in, please.

511
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,832
What happened to them?

512
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,511
It would seem the Grissom was
destroyed by an enemy attack.

513
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,837
We must go.
They will soon come after us.

514
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,469
Estimating Genesis,
2.9 hours present speed.

515
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,719
- Can we hold speed, Scotty?
- Aye, she's got her second wind now.

516
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,436
- Scan for vessels in pursuit.
- Scanning. Indications negative.

517
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,874
Did I get it right?

518
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,310
Great, Bones, just great.

519
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,509
It's time for total truth between us.

520
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,950
This planet is not what you intended
or hoped for, is it?

521
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,230
Not exactly.

522
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,556
Why?

523
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,512
I used proto-matter
in the Genesis matrix.

524
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,840
An unstable substance which
every ethical scientist in the galaxy

525
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,679
has denounced
as dangerously unpredictable.

526
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,440
It was the only way
to solve certain problems.

527
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,633
So, like your father,
you changed the rules.

528
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,355
If I hadn't, it might have been
years, or never!

529
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,517
How many have paid the price
for your impatience?

530
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,793
How many have died?
How much damage have you done?

531
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,479
And what is yet to come?

532
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,269
Bridge, nothing happening here.

533
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,311
- This planet is ageing in surges.
- And Spock with it.

534
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,398
- It seems they're joined together.
- They are.

535
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,159
How long?

536
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,075
Days. Maybe hours.

537
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,990
I'm sorry.

538
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,398
It will be hardest on Spock.

539
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,751
Soon he will feel the burning
of his Vulcan blood.

540
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,476
- I don't understand.
- Pon Farr.

541
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,275
Vulcan males must endure it every
seventh year of their adult life.

542
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,356
Whoever they are,
they're getting closer.

543
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,391
- I'll go.
- No.

544
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,272
I'll do it. Give me your phaser.

545
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,511
Sir, Starfleet calling USS Grissom.
A warning about us.

546
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,073
- Response?
- Nothing. As before.

547
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,271
What's the Grissom up to?
Will she join us or fire on us?

548
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,349
Chekov, break silence. Send
Captain Esteban my compliments.

549
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,153
- How are we doing?
- How are we doing?

550
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,113
Funny you should put it
quite that way, Jim.

551
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,357
We are doing fine.
But I'd feel safer

552
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,996
giving him one of my kidneys
than what's scrambled in my brain.

553
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,400
No response from Grissom
on any channel.

554
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,599
Keep trying.
At regular intervals.

555
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,994
So it has come.

556
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,876
It is called Pon Farr.

557
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,714
Pon Farr.

558
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,231
Will you trust me?

559
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,472
We are secured from Warp Speed.
Now entering Genesis Sector.

560
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,430
Proceed at impulse power.

561
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,197
- Vessel entering sector.
- Yes.

562
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,359
Federation Battle Cruiser.
Have they scanned us?

563
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,516
Not yet.

564
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,910
Engage cloaking device.

565
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,598
I'd swear there was
something there, sir.

566
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,074
What did you see?

567
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,670
For an instant, a scout class vessel.

568
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,276
Could be Grissom.
Patch in the hailing frequency.

569
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,397
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Please come in.

570
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,158
Grissom, this is
Enterprise calling. Do you read?

571
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,678
Spock!

572
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,356
I've come a long way
for the power of Genesis.

573
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,074
And what do I find?

574
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,796
A weakling human,
a Vulcan boy and a woman.

575
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,912
My Lord, we are survivors
of a doomed expedition.

576
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,511
This planet will destroy itself soon.
The Genesis experiment is a failure.

577
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,156
A failure?

578
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,672
The most powerful destructive force
ever created.

579
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,152
You will tell me the secret
of the Genesis torpedo.

580
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,514
I have no knowledge.

581
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,632
Then I hope pain
is something you enjoy.

582
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,955
- I ordered no interruptions.
- But, sir...

583
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,277
- Federation Starship approaching.
- Bring me up.

584
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,198
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling.
Do you read?

585
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:18,036
Grissom, this is Enterprise
calling. Please come in.

586
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,957
Battle Alert!

587
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,151
Grissom, this is Enterprise.

588
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,353
Admiral Kirk calling Captain
Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik.

589
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,074
- Report status.
- We are cloaked.

590
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,398
Enemy closing on impulse power.
Range five thousand kellicams.

591
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:41,594
Good! This is just the turn of luck
I have been waiting for.

592
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,755
- Nothing on my scanner, sir.
- Short-range scan, Mr Chekov.

593
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,632
Put it on visual, Mr Sulu.

594
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,310
Range three thousand kellicams.

595
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,991
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

596
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,078
Range two thousand kellicams.

597
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,793
Stand by to transfer energy
to weapons.

598
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,990
At my command.

599
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,035
There! That distortion, see it?

600
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,834
Yes, sir. It's getting larger
as we close in.

601
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,554
Firing range, sir.

602
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,398
Gunner...

603
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,877
Target engine only. Understood?

604
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,156
Understood clearly, sir.

605
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,992
- Opinion, Mr Sulu.
- I think it's an energy surge.

606
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,760
- Enough energy to hide a ship?
- A cloaking device.

607
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,240
Red Alert, Mr Scott.

608
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,029
One thousand kellicams and closing.

609
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,117
All power to the weapons systems.

610
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,830
Wait. Wait.

611
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,319
No shields?

612
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,559
If my guess is right, they'll have to
de-cloak before they can fire.

613
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,830
May all your guesses be right.

614
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,558
- Klingon Bird of Prey. Arming.
- Fire, Mr Scott!

615
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,436
Good shooting, Mr Scott.

616
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,631
Precautionary, Mr Chekov, shields up.

617
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:07,235
Emergency power to the thrusters!

618
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,956
- Sir, the shield's non-responsive.
- Scotty?

619
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,551
The automation system's overloaded.
I didn't expect combat, you know.

620
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,550
Fire!

621
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,314
Emergency power.
Prepare to return fire.

622
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,830
Mr Scott, can you transfer power
to phaser banks?

623
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,668
I don't think so. They've
knocked out the automation centre.

624
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,190
- I've got no control over anything.
- Mr Sulu?

625
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,356
Nothing, sir.

626
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,396
So... we're a sitting duck.

627
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,952
Ready to fire emergency tube.

628
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,076
Why haven't they finished us?
They outgun me ten to one!

629
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,989
My Lord. The enemy commander
wishes a truce to confer.

630
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,119
Put them on screen.

631
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,508
This is Admiral James T. Kirk of
the Federation Starship Enterprise.

632
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,757
- The Genesis Commander himself.
- A violation of treaty...

633
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,269
...between the Federation
and the Klingon Empire,

634
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,153
...your presence here
is an act of war.

635
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,638
You have two minutes to surrender
your crew and your vessel...

636
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,674
...or we will destroy you.
- He's hiding something.

637
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,872
We may have dealt him
a more serious blow than I thought.

638
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,197
- How can you tell that?
- I trust my instincts.

639
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,159
Admiral Kirk,
this is your opponent speaking.

640
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,072
Don't lecture me
about treaty violations!

641
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,070
In creating an ultimate weapon,
the Federation has become criminals!

642
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,955
It is not I who will surrender,
it is you!

643
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,635
On the planet below,
I have three prisoners

644
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,276
from the team who developed
your doomsday weapon.

645
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,440
If you don't surrender, I'll execute
them as enemies of galactic peace!

646
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,389
Who is this?
How dare you take prisoners?

647
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,469
Who I am is not important.
That I have them is.

648
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,398
You may speak to them.

649
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,790
- Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
- Saavik!

650
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,515
- Is David with you?
- Yes, and someone else.

651
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,598
A Vulcan scientist
of your acquaintance.

652
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,679
This... Vulcan...

653
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,519
Is he alive?

654
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,234
He is not himself, but he lives.

655
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,000
He's subject to rapid ageing,
like this unstable planet.

656
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,469
Hello, sir, it's David.

657
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,511
I'm sorry I'm late.

658
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,508
I should've known you'd come.
It's true, this planet is unstable.

659
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,836
It's gonna destroy itself
within hours.

660
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,996
David, what went wrong?

661
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,634
- I went wrong.
- I don't understand.

662
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,559
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender.

663
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,548
Genesis doesn't work. I can't believe
they'd kill us for it.

664
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,912
Admiral, your friend is mistaken,
I meant what I said.

665
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,591
And to show that my intentions are
sincere, I shall kill one prisoner.

666
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,756
Wait! Give me a chance to talk...

667
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,589
Kill one of them.
I don't care which.

668
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,836
Saavik?

669
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,836
David?

670
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,438
Admiral... David is dead.

671
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,478
You Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son.

672
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,830
Klingon bastard,
you've killed my son!

673
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,880
You Klingon bastard!

674
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,276
There are two more prisoners,
Admiral.

675
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,869
Do you want them killed, too?

676
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,433
Surrender your vessel.

677
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,039
All right. All right, damn you.

678
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,876
All right.

679
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,831
Give me a minute to inform my crew.

680
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,149
I give two minutes to you
and your gallant crew.

681
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,952
Take every last man, form
a boarding party, armed heavily!

682
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,072
- They outnumber us, my Lord.
- We are Klingons!

683
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,590
Once you control the ship
we will transfer our flag there

684
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,836
and take Genesis
from their memory banks.

685
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,112
Mr Sulu, what is the crew complement
of a Bird of Prey?

686
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,914
About a dozen officers and men.

687
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,438
With some of them on the planet.

688
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,400
I swear to you,
we're not finished yet.

689
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,672
Bones, you and Sulu to the
Transporter Room, the rest with me.

690
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,030
We have a job to do.

691
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:50,073
Commander Klingon vessel. Prepare
to board this ship on my next signal.

692
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,514
No tricks, Kirk! You have one minute.

693
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,270
No tricks. I'm looking forward
to meeting you.

694
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,673
To the Transport Room. Success!

695
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,913
Computer, this is Admiral James
T. Kirk, requesting security access.

696
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,629
Computer, destruct Sequence One,
Code: 1...

697
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,594
1 A...

698
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:40,110
Computer, Commander Montgomery
Scott, Chief Engineering Officer.

699
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:45,155
Destruct Sequence Two,
Code: 11 A 2B.

700
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,517
Computer, this is Commander
Pavel Chekov, acting Science Officer.

701
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:02,398
Destruct Sequence Three,
Code: 1 B2B3.

702
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,517
Destruct Sequence
completed and engaged.

703
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,712
Awaiting final Code
for one-minute countdown.

704
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,674
Code: 000.

705
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,918
Destruct 0.

706
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,433
Destruct Sequence is activated.

707
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,834
Kirk, your time runs out.

708
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,988
- All set?
- Aye, sir.

709
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,271
Commander Klingon vessel, we are
energising transporter beam, now.

710
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,436
Transporter, stand by!

711
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,508
My Lord, the ship appears
to be deserted.

712
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,676
How can that be? They're hiding.

713
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,429
Yes, sir, but the bridge seems
to be run by computer.

714
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:45,270
- It's the only thing speaking.
- Speaking? Let me hear.

715
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,953
Nine, eight, seven, six...

716
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,349
...five...
- Get out! Get out of there!

717
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,152
- Get out!
...one...

718
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,874
My God, Bones.
What have I done?

719
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,959
What you had to do.
What you always do.

720
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,993
Turn death into
a fighting chance to live.

721
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,359
Planet core readings, unstable.
Changing rapidly.

722
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,272
What about surface life signs?

723
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,436
There.

724
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,189
No! Don't touch him!

725
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,956
Bones.

726
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,349
- What happened?
- He gave his life to save us.

727
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,918
Rapid ageing. All genetic functions
highly accelerated.

728
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,078
- What about his mind?
- His mind's a void.

729
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,477
It seems, Admiral,
that I've got all his marbles.

730
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,919
- Is there anything we can do?
- Only one thing.

731
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:57,353
Get him off this planet. His ageing
is part of what's going on around us.

732
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,919
Klingon Commander,
this is Admiral James T. Kirk.

733
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,997
I'm alive and well
on the planet's surface.

734
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,033
I know this will come
as a pleasant surprise to you.

735
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:33,676
Our ship was a victim
of an unfortunate accident.

736
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,634
Sorry about your crew, but as we say
on Earth, "C'est la vie".

737
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,196
I have what you want.

738
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,193
I have the secret of Genesis.

739
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,471
You're gonna have to
bring us up there to get it.

740
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,953
Do you hear me?

741
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,276
I'm waiting for you!

742
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,634
What is your answer?

743
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,518
Drop all weapons!

744
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,116
Over there, all but Kirk.

745
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,717
Maltz... Prisoners
at beam coordinates.

746
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,514
- You should take the Vulcan too.
- No!

747
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,430
- But why?
- Because you wish it.

748
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,756
Maltz... Activate beam!

749
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,713
Genesis. I want it!

750
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,390
Beam the Vulcan up, and we'll talk.

751
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,198
Give me what I want
and I'll consider it.

752
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,790
Fool! Look around you!
The planet's destroying itself!

753
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,389
Yes, exhilarating, isn't it?

754
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,993
If we don't help each other,
we'll die here!

755
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,590
Perfect!
Then that's the way it shall be.

756
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,275
Give me Genesis!

757
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,879
- Give me your hand!
- Kirk!

758
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,594
I... have had...

759
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,916
...enough of you!

760
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,795
Maltz!

761
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,991
Don't! How many more?

762
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,519
Just him, sir.

763
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,994
Bones, help Spock.

764
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,558
We've got to break out of orbit.

765
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,751
You, help us or die.

766
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,235
I do not deserve to live.

767
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,955
Fine, I'll kill you later.
Let's get out of here.

768
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,118
- Where's the anti-matter inducer?
- This?

769
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,594
No! This!

770
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,550
That or nothing.

771
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,752
If I read this right, sir,
we have full power.

772
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,037
Go, Sulu.

773
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,396
Goodbye, David.

774
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,430
We are clear and free to navigate.

775
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,431
Best speed to Vulcan.
Mr Chekov, take the prisoner below.

776
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,349
- Wait! You said you would kill me.
- I lied.

777
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,278
Spock...

778
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,390
For God's sake, talk to me!

779
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:03,029
You stuck this damn thing
in my head, remember?

780
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,036
Remember?

781
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,199
Now, tell me what to do with it.

782
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,236
Help me.

783
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,353
I'm gonna tell you
something that I...

784
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,597
...never thought I'd hear myself say.

785
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,513
But it seems I've missed you.

786
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,632
I don't know if I could stand
to lose you again.

787
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,875
Ambassador, they are on approach.

788
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,356
They're requesting
permission to land.

789
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,518
Permission granted. Tell them...

790
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,632
Tell Kirk we'll be ready.

791
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:29,632
Mr Sulu, you're on manual.

792
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,359
It's been a while, sir. Here we go.

793
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,679
Retrothrusters.

794
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,319
Sarek is waiting above, sir.

795
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,396
Sarek...

796
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:41,071
Child of Skon, child of Solkar...

797
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,117
The body of your son breathes still.

798
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,836
What is your wish?

799
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:54,636
I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan. The refusion.

800
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,075
What you seek has not been done
since ages past,

801
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,589
and then only in legend.

802
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,909
Your request is not logical.

803
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,792
Forgive me, T'Lar.

804
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:15,395
My logic is uncertain
where my son is concerned.

805
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,549
Who is the keeper of the Katra?

806
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,199
I am.

807
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,756
McCoy, Leonard H., son of David.

808
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,268
McCoy, Son of David...

809
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,119
Since thou art human,
we cannot expect thee

810
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,517
to understand fully
what Sarek has requested.

811
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,431
Spock's body lives.

812
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:43,269
With your approval,
we shall use all our powers

813
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:47,473
to return to his body
that which you possess.

814
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:53,113
But McCoy, you must now be warned.

815
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:58,633
The danger to thyself
is as grave as the danger to Spock.

816
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,112
You must make the choice.

817
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,750
I choose the danger.

818
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,398
Hell of a time to ask.

819
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,716
I'm all right, Jim.

820
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,632
What about Spock?

821
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,551
Only time will answer.

822
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,039
Kirk... I thank you.
What you have done is...

823
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,151
What I have done...

824
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,713
...I had to do.

825
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,072
But at what cost?

826
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,510
Your ship. Your son.

827
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,479
If I hadn't tried...
the cost would have been my soul.

828
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,432
My father says
that you have been my friend.

829
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,550
You came back for me.

830
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,558
You would have done
the same for me.

831
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,229
Why would you do this?

832
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,869
Because the needs of the one...

833
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,917
...outweigh the needs of the many.

834
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,034
I have been...

835
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:12,949
...and ever shall be your friend.

836
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,950
Yes.

837
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,037
Yes, Spock!

838
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,993
The ship. Out of danger?

839
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,634
You saved the ship.

840
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,673
You saved us all.
Don't you remember?

841
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,036
Jim.

842
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,274
Your name is Jim.

843
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,796
Yes.

844
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,676
