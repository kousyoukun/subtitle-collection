1
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,180
Don't grieve, Admiral.

2
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,560
It is logical.

3
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,360
The needs of the many outweigh...

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,240
...the needs of the few.

5
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,750
Or the one.

6
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,120
I have been and always shall be your friend.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,010
Live long and prosper.

8
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,560
We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead.

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,740
This death takes place in the shadow of new life,

10
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,270
the sunrise of a new world.

11
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,320
A world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect.

12
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,240
He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one.

13
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,500
Of my friend, I can only say this:

14
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,430
Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels,

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,680
his was the most...

16
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,850
...human.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,060
Honours. Hup!

18
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,160
Space, the final frontier.

19
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,430
These are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise.

20
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Her ongoing mission to explore strange new worlds.

21
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,480
To seek out new lifeforms and new civilisations.

22
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,820
To boldly go...

23
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,660
...where no man has gone before.

24
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,450
USS Enterprise, Captain's Personal Log.

25
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,830
With most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home.

26
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,260
Yet I feel uneasy. And I wonder why.

27
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,260
Perhaps it is the emptiness of this vessel.

28
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,970
Most of our trainee crew has been reassigned.

29
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,100
Lieutenant Saavik and my son David

30
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,850
are exploring the Genesis planet, which he helped create.

31
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,650
And Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone.

32
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,320
No, more empty even than that.

33
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,530
The death of Spock is like an open wound.

34
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,740
It seems that I've left the noblest part of myself back there...

35
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,080
...on that newborn planet.

36
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,250
Status, Mr Sulu. On course, Admiral.

37
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,090
Estimating space dock in 2.1 hours.

38
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,220
Very well. Mr Chekov, I'll need a pre-approach scan.

39
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,930
Take the science station, please. Yes, sir.

40
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,650
Uhura... Any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis enquiries?

41
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,150
No, sir, there is no response. That's very odd.

42
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,200
Scotty, progress report. It's almost done, sir.

43
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,820
You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.

44
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,830
Excellent timing. You fixed the barn door after the horse has come home.

45
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,450
How much refit time till we can take her out again?

46
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,340
Eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks, so I'll do it in two.

47
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,840
Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?

48
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,800
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?

49
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,340
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.

50
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,350
Mr Sulu, take the Con. I'll be in my quarters.

51
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,230
Sir?

52
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,690
Are they planning a ceremony when we get in?

53
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,570
I mean, a reception? Would you like a hero's welcome?

54
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,490
Well, God knows there should be.

55
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,460
This time we've paid for the party with our dearest blood.

56
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,920
Steady. Steady, boys.

57
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,670
Keep scanning.

58
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,210
I thought you people were reliable. Where the hell is he?

59
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,890
He's been here for some time. Put me on hailing frequency.

60
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,220
Commander Kruge... This is Valkris.

61
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,970
I have purchased the Genesis data. Ready to transmit.

62
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,310
Well done, Valkris.

63
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,110
What the hell is...

64
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,730
Disengage cloaking device!

65
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,380
Transmit data. Now!

66
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,190
Transmission completed.

67
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,110
You will find it useful.

68
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,070
Then you have seen it?

69
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,540
I have, my Lord.

70
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,660
Unfortunate.

71
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,910
Understood.

72
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,300
Thrusters.

73
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,020
What the hell's going on? When do I get paid off?

74
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,850
Soon, Captain. Quite soon.

75
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,200
Success, my Lord... and my love.

76
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,790
You will be remembered with honour.

77
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,090
Fire!

78
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,140
New course. Federation neutral zone.

79
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,110
Feed him!

80
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,360
Yes, my Lord.

81
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,390
Approach Control, this is Enterprise, ready for docking manoeuvre.

82
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,810
Enterprise is cleared to dock. Lock on.

83
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,480
Systems locked.

84
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,160
Spacedock, you have control. Affirmative, Enterprise.

85
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,160
Enjoy the ride, and welcome home. Enterprise confirms.

86
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,110
Acknowledge, doors closed.

87
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,830
Would you look at that!

88
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,870
My friends, the great experiment.

89
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,090
The Excelsior. Ready for trial runs.

90
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,420
She's supposed to have transwarp drive.

91
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,470
And if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a wagon.

92
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,520
Young minds, fresh ideas. Be tolerant, Mr Scott.

93
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,670
Standby umbilical and gravitational support systems.

94
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,970
Aye, sir, moorings activated, all systems standing by.

95
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,760
Admiral. This is not possible. Mr Chekov.

96
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,390
An energy reading from 'C' deck, from inside Mr Spock's quarters.

97
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,980
I ordered Spock's quarters sealed. I sealed the room myself!

98
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,690
Nevertheless, I am reading a lifeform there.

99
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,370
This entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour regarding Spock.

100
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,830
Sir, Security reports the door to Spock's quarters has been forced.

101
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,630
I'm on my way. Sulu, continue docking procedures.

102
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,640
Jim...

103
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,760
Help me.

104
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,140
You left me on Genesis. Why did you do that?

105
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,440
Help me.

106
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,190
Bones!

107
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,280
What the hell are you doing?

108
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,820
Have you lost your mind?

109
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,710
Help me, Jim. Take me home.

110
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,260
Bones, we are. We are home.

111
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,590
Then perhaps it's not too late.

112
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,300
Climb the steps, Jim.

113
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,190
Climb the steps of Mount Seleya.

114
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,390
Mount Seleya?

115
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,110
Bones, Mount Seleya's on Vulcan. We're home... on Earth.

116
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,820
Remember.

117
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,400
Admiral, docking is completed.

118
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,070
Starfleet Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection.

119
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,920
Uhura, get the medics down here! Get them now!

120
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,600
You've all done remarkable service under the most difficult conditions.

121
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,760
You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendation.

122
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,590
And more importantly... extended shore leave.

123
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,150
All but you, Mr Scott. They need your wisdom on the new Excelsior.

124
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
Report there tomorrow as Captain of Engineering.

125
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,650
With all appreciation, I'd prefer to supervise the refit of Enterprise.

126
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,150
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.

127
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,700
But, sir...

128
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,610
I'm sorry, Mr Scott, but there will be no refit.

129
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,120
Admiral... I don't understand. The Enterprise is not...

130
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,460
Jim, the Enterprise is 20 years old. We feel her day is over.

131
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,970
But we had requested...

132
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,350
We had hoped to take her back to Genesis.

133
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,480
That is out of the question. May I ask why?

134
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,070
In your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy.

135
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,860
Until the Federation Council makes policy,

136
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,570
you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone

137
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,160
your knowledge of Genesis.

138
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,660
Consider it a quarantine planet... and a forbidden subject.

139
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,010
To understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to review

140
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,600
the theoretical data on the Genesis device,

141
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,560
as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus.

142
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,900
Genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness.

143
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,890
The device was to be introduced into a pre-selected area

144
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,780
of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead form.

145
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,790
The device would instantaneously cause the Genesis efect.

146
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,490
Instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now exists,

147
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:17,050
capable of sustaining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it.

148
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,020
So?

149
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,440
Speak.

150
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,980
Great power to control, dominate.

151
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,200
Speak. Impressive.

152
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,950
They can make a planet.

153
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,420
Oh, yes. New cities, homes in the country.

154
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,710
Your woman at your side, children playing at your feet.

155
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,580
And overhead, fluttering in the breeze, the flag of the Federation!

156
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,380
Charming.

157
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,590
Station. Yes, my Lord.

158
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,480
Share this with no one. Understood, my Lord.

159
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,190
We are going to this planet.

160
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,110
Even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation,

161
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,490
we will act for the preservation of our race.

162
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,940
We will seize the secret of this weapon.

163
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,780
The secret of ultimate power!

164
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,080
Success, my Lord.

165
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,310
We have reached the destination planet at point 035.

166
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,320
Very well, Lieutenant. Helm.

167
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,110
Execute standard orbital approach.

168
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,780
Send a coded message for Starfleet Commander, Priority One.

169
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,830
"Federation science vessel Grissom arriving Genesis, Mutara Sector,"

170
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,920
"to begin research. J.T. Esteban commanding."

171
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,130
Dr Marcus, it's your planet.

172
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,840
Begin scanning, please.

173
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,100
This is where the fun begins, Saavik.

174
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,180
Just like your father, so human.

175
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,480
All units functional. Recorders are on. Scanning Sector 1.

176
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,070
The foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature 22.2 Celsius.

177
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:57,200
Sector 2 indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation. Temperature 39.4.

178
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,750
Sector 3, sub-tropical vegetation.

179
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,920
Temperature decreasing rapidly.

180
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,560
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!

181
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,260
Fascinating.

182
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,270
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth, within hours' walk.

183
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,180
Metallic mass. Close range scan.

184
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,440
A photon tube.

185
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,520
Gravitational fields were in flux. It must have soft landed.

186
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,490
In code to Starfleet:

187
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,660
"Captain Spock's tube located on Genesis surface."

188
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,250
I don't believe it.

189
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,250
What is it?

190
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,350
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are an animal lifeform.

191
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,260
You said there wouldn't be any. There shouldn't be.

192
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,940
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable lifeform reading.

193
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,020
You wish to advise Starfleet, sir?

194
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,070
We don't know what we're talking about here.

195
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
Why don't we beam it up? Oh, no.

196
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,860
Regulations state, "Nothing shall be beamed aboard"

197
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,530
"until danger of contamination is eliminated."

198
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,290
Captain, beaming down to the surface is permitted.

199
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,250
If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably safe.

200
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,050
Please, we must see what it is. Or who.

201
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,760
Absent friends.

202
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,640
Admiral, what's going to happen to the Enterprise?

203
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,940
She's to be decommissioned. Will we get another ship?

204
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:54,110
I can't get an answer. Starfleet's up to its brass in galactic conference.

205
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,110
No one has time for those who stand and wait.

206
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,450
Sir, about Dr McCoy, how is he?

207
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,790
He's home, resting comfortably, pumped full of tranquilizers.

208
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,330
They say it's exhaustion. He promised he'd stay put. We'll see.

209
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,290
Ah, Mr Scott.

210
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,460
Come.

211
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,940
Sarek!

212
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,980
Ambassador, I had no idea you were here. I believe you know my crew.

213
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,040
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.

214
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,490
Please excuse us.

215
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,040
Ambassador, I would have come to Vulcan to express my deep sympathy.

216
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,840
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government.

217
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,180
I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.

218
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,470
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.

219
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,970
Why did you leave him on Genesis?

220
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,230
Spock trusted you. And you denied him his future.

221
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,450
I saw no future. Only his body was in death, Kirk.

222
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,320
And you were the last one to be with him.

223
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,410
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.

224
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,490
But why? Because he asked you to!

225
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,750
He entrusted you...

226
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,130
...with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body!

227
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,010
He asked you to bring him to us.

228
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,810
And to bring that which he gave you: His Katra. His living spirit.

229
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,930
Sir...

230
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,520
Your son meant more to me than you can know.

231
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,360
I'd have given my life if it would have saved his.

232
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,160
Believe me when I tell you... he made no request of me.

233
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,860
He would not have spoken of it openly.

234
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,700
Then how was...

235
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,410
I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?

236
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,590
Certainly.

237
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,190
He spoke of your friendship.

238
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,280
Yes.

239
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,650
He... asked you not to grieve.

240
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,080
Yes.

241
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,880
The needs of the many...

242
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,750
...outweigh...

243
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,340
...the needs of the few...

244
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,590
...or the one.

245
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,520
Spock...

246
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,190
I have been...

247
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,310
...and always shall be your friend.

248
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,940
Live long and prosper.

249
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,740
No.

250
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,920
Forgive me.

251
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,340
It is not here.

252
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,090
I had assumed he mind-melded with you.

253
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,770
It is the Vulcan way... when the body's end is near.

254
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,430
We were separated.

255
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,770
He couldn't touch me.

256
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,280
I see.

257
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,620
Then everything that he was...

258
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,490
...everything he knew...

259
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,250
...is lost.

260
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,010
Please wait.

261
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,390
He would have found a way. If there was that much at stake,

262
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,730
Spock would have found a way.

263
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,440
Yes. But how?

264
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,320
What if he joined with someone else?

265
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,950
Engine Room, Flight Recorder Visual. Star date 8128. 78.

266
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,500
Go.

267
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,740
Ship... out of danger?

268
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,590
Yes.

269
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,960
Back, 0.77.

270
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,970
Flight Recorder Visual, 28. 77.

271
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,470
No! You'll flood the whole compartment!

272
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,440
He'll die. Captain! He's dead already.

273
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,650
Back, 0.76.

274
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,320
Flight Recorder Visual, 28. 76.

275
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,990
You're not going in there! Perhaps you're right.

276
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,370
What is Mr Scott's condition? I don't think that he...

277
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,200
Sorry, Doctor, I have no time to discuss this logically.

278
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,340
Freeze.

279
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,710
Repeat... and augment.

280
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,680
Remember...

281
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,480
McCoy!

282
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,970
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.

283
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,810
What must I do?

284
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,030
You must bring them to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.

285
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,610
Only there can both find peace.

286
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,700
What you ask...

287
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,660
...is difficult.

288
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,000
You will find a way, Kirk.

289
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,300
If you honour them both, you must.

290
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,800
I will.

291
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,020
I swear.

292
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,940
Transporter Room, stand by to energise.

293
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,140
Aye, sir, energising now.

294
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,290
Grissom to Saavik. We're picking up radiation from the lifeform.

295
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,090
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.

296
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,510
Exercise caution, Lieutenant.

297
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,640
This landing is Captain's discretion, and I'm the one who's out on a limb.

298
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,100
I'll try to remember that.

299
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,450
There are your lifeforms. These were microbes on the tube's surface.

300
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:46,950
We shot them here from Enterprise. They were fruitful and multiplied.

301
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,260
But how could they have evolved so quickly?

302
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,730
Saavik...

303
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,940
What is it?

304
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,200
Spock's burial robe.

305
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,720
No, absolutely not, Jim. You're my best officer.

306
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,140
But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules.

307
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,230
Don't quote rules to me. I'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice.

308
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,850
One man who's died for us, another with deep emotional problems.

309
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,860
This business about Spock and McCoy...

310
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,910
Honestly, I never understood Vulcan mysticism.

311
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,620
You don't have to believe. I'm not even sure that I believe.

312
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:08,540
But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul...

313
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,760
...then it's my responsibility. Yours?

314
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,720
As surely as if it were my very own.

315
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,470
Give me back the Enterprise. With Scotty's help I could...

316
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,270
The Enterprise would never stand the pounding, and you know it!

317
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,940
Then I'll hire a ship. Out of the question, my friend.

318
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,810
The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis.

319
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:41,650
Your life and your career stand for rationality, not intellectual chaos.

320
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,990
Keep up this emotional behaviour and you'll lose everything.

321
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,960
You'll destroy yourself. Do you understand me, Jim?

322
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,090
I hear you.

323
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,290
I had to try.

324
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,420
Of course.

325
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,710
Thanks for the drink. Any time.

326
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,390
The word, sir? The word...

327
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,900
...is no. I am therefore going anyway.

328
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,440
You can count on our help, sir. Shall I alert Dr McCoy?

329
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,910
Please. He has a long journey ahead of him.

330
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,640
Long time, Doc.

331
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,560
Yeah. Anybody been looking for me?

332
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,310
I have, but what's the use? What'll it be?

333
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,440
Altair water. That's not your usual poison.

334
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,160
To expect one to order poison in a bar is not logical.

335
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,570
Got it.

336
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,500
To your planet, welcome.

337
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,050
I think that's my line, stranger. Oh, forgive.

338
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:33,350
I here am new. But you are known, being McCoy from Enterprise.

339
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,570
You have me at a disadvantage, sir. I name not important.

340
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,940
You seek I. Message received.

341
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,860
Available ship stands by.

342
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,210
How much and how soon?

343
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,210
How soon is now. How much is where.

344
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,920
Somewhere in the Mutara Sector. Oh, Mutara restricted!

345
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,260
Take permits many. Money more.

346
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,590
There aren't going to be any damn permits!

347
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,180
How can you get a permit to do a damn illegal thing?

348
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,260
Look... Price you name, money I got!

349
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,160
Place you name, money I name, otherwise bargain, no.

350
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,660
All right, dammit! Genesis. The name of the place we're going is Genesis!

351
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,250
Genesis?!

352
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,200
Yes, Genesis! How can you be deaf with ears like that?

353
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,500
Genesis allowed is not! It's planet forbidden!

354
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,760
Look, my backward friend. Genesis may be planet forbidden, but I'm...

355
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,890
Sir, I'm sorry. You don't want to be discussing this subject in public.

356
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,220
I'll discuss what I like! And who in the hell are you?!

357
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,350
Would you like a ride home, Dr McCoy?

358
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:04,740
If I wanted a ride home, would I be trying to charter a space flight?

359
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,540
How in the hell do you know who I am?

360
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,120
Federation Security, sir.

361
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,880
You're gonna get a nice long rest, Doctor.

362
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,120
Saavik to Grissom. We are definitely reading a second lifeform.

363
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:54,740
We concur. Proceed with caution, Saavik.

364
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,070
What the hell is going on down there?

365
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,580
Be quick, Admiral. They're moving him to the Federation 'Funny Farm'.

366
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,010
Yes, poor friend. I hear he's fruity as a nutcake.

367
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,550
Two minutes.

368
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,520
Jim!

369
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,430
How many fingers do I have up? That's not very damn funny.

370
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,780
Your sense of humour has returned. The hell it has. What's that?

371
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,660
Lexorin. Lexorin? What for?

372
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,320
You're suffering from a Vulcan mind-meld, Doctor.

373
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,450
That green-blooded son-of-a-bitch.

374
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,160
It's his revenge for all those arguments he lost.

375
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,790
Let me see your hand. This will make you well enough to travel.

376
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,550
Where's Admiral Kirk? With the prisoner.

377
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,220
Get him quickly. Commander, Starfleet, wants him right away.

378
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,390
Keeping you busy?

379
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,440
Don't get smart, Tiny.

380
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,690
Admiral, Starfleet... This man's sick. Look.

381
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Side elevator. Agents on their way up.

382
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,920
Don't call me Tiny.

383
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,220
Unit Two, this is unit One.

384
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,720
The Koyabashi Maru has set sail for the promised land.

385
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.

386
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,860
You're taking me to the promised land?

387
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,110
What are friends for?

388
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,750
Mr Scott... Calling it a night?

389
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,780
Yes, sir. Turning in myself.

390
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,880
Looking forward to breaking some of Enterprise's speed records tomorrow.

391
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,000
Good night.

392
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,460
Level, please. Transporter Room.

393
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,300
Thank you. Up your shaft!

394
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,050
Roger, Old City Station at 22.00 hours. All is well.

395
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,230
Understood. All stations clear.

396
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,980
You amaze me, Commander.

397
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,360
A 20-year space veteran, you choose the worst duty station in town.

398
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,490
I mean, look at this place! This is the hind end of space.

399
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,200
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.

400
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:43,240
Maybe that's okay for someone like you, whose career is winding down.

401
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,330
But me, I need some challenge in my life, adventure.

402
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,460
Maybe even just a surprise or two.

403
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,510
Well, you know what they say. Be careful what you wish for.

404
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,180
You may get it.

405
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:01,550
Good evening, Commander. Is everything ready?

406
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,260
Step into my parlour, gentlemen.

407
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,310
That's Admiral Kirk, my God. Very good for you, Lieutenant.

408
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,770
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded IDs.

409
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,280
All true. What are we going to do about it?

410
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm not going to do anything, but you're going to sit in the closet.

411
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,370
Have you lost all your sense of reality?

412
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,620
This isn't reality.

413
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,540
This is fantasy. You wanted adventure, how's this?

414
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,210
The old adrenalin going, huh? Good boy.

415
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,960
Now get in the closet.

416
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,180
Go on. Go on! I'll just get in the closet.

417
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,720
Okay!

418
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm glad you're on our side. Can you handle that?

419
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,520
I'll have Mr Adventure eating out of my hand, sir.

420
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,270
And I'll see all of you at the rendezvous. And Admiral...

421
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,650
All my hopes.

422
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,800
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready.

423
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,970
A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.

424
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,720
Thank you, Mr Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.

425
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,610
My friends, I can't ask you to go any further.

426
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,940
Dr McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.

427
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,200
Admiral, we're losing precious time.

428
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,580
What course, please, Admiral? Mr Scott?

429
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,790
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.

430
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,760
Gentlemen... May the wind be at our backs. Stations, please.

431
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,970
Engage auto systems. Aye. Engaged.

432
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,590
Clear all moorings. Cleared, sir.

433
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,810
One quarter impulse power. One quarter impulse.

434
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,750
Commander, Starfleet, on emergency channel.

435
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,200
He orders you to surrender this vessel.

436
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,500
No reply, Chekov. Steady as she goes, Sulu.

437
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,210
Yellow Alert. Captain to the bridge.

438
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,270
This is the Captain. How can you have a Yellow Alert in spacedock?

439
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,810
Sir, someone is stealing the Enterprise.

440
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,860
I'm on my way.

441
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,940
Yellow Alert. All stations, Yellow Alert.

442
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,740
Yellow Alert. All stations, Yellow Alert.

443
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,660
One minute to spacedoors.

444
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,580
Are you gonna walk through them? Calm yourself.

445
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,720
Sir. Excelsior powering up with orders to pursue.

446
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,260
Yellow Alert.

447
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,060
Status.

448
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,970
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted.

449
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,980
All speeds available through Transwarp Drive.

450
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,230
Incredible machine.

451
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,360
Helm. One quarter impulse power.

452
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,030
Thirty seconds to spacedoors.

453
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,370
Warning, secured spacedoors.

454
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,080
Warning, secured spacedoors.

455
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,930
And now, Mr Scott. Sir?

456
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,470
The doors, Mr Scott! Aye, sir, I'm workin' on it.

457
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,310
Danger, spacedoors are closed. Danger.

458
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,960
We have cleared spacedoors.

459
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,350
Full impulse power. Aye, sir.

460
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,040
Standby tractor beam. Tractor beam, on.

461
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,380
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's in for a shock.

462
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,060
Excelsior closing to 4,000 metres, sir.

463
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,020
We'll need everything you have. Warp Drive standing by.

464
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,030
Kirk...

465
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,070
If you do this, you'll never sit in the Captain's chair again.

466
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,450
Warp Speed. Aye, sir. Warp Speed.

467
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,210
Prepare for Warp Speed. Stand by Transwarp Drive.

468
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,550
Transwarp at your command. Full power available.

469
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,670
Execute.

470
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,270
...power available.

471
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,690
Full power available.

472
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:42,870
Transwarp Drive, maximum velocity in five, four, three, two, one.

473
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,880
Scotty, as good as your word.

474
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,340
The more they overtake the plumbing, the easier to stop up the drain.

475
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,940
Here, Doctor, souvenirs from one surgeon to another.

476
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,600
I took them out of her main Transwarp computer drive.

477
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,690
Nice of you to tell me in advance. You missed the staff meeting.

478
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,030
Your work today has been outstanding.

479
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,530
I will recommend you all for promotion...

480
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,160
...in whatever fleet we end up serving. Best speed to Genesis.

481
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,110
I am Saavik. Can you speak?

482
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,910
The Genesis Wave. His cells could have been regenerated.

483
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,710
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please.

484
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,050
Yes, Saavik, go ahead. We have found the life sign.

485
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,470
It is a Vulcan child, perhaps eight to ten Earth years of age.

486
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:04,840
A child?! How did he get there? It is Dr Marcus' opinion that...

487
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:11,480
...that the Genesis effect has in some way regenerated... Captain Spock.

488
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,540
Saavik, that's... extraordinary. What would you like to do next?

489
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,920
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.

490
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,750
Does Dr Marcus think there's any chance of radioactive contamination?

491
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,590
No. None that he can detect, sir.

492
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,380
I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.

493
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,420
I'm sure Starfleet would approve. But let's do it by the book.

494
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,020
Standby on this channel. Go.

495
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,730
Starfleet Command, this is USS Grissom on coded channel 98.8.

496
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,770
Come in, please.

497
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,660
Sir, something is jamming our transmission. An energy surge.

498
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,530
Locate!

499
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,740
Sir, it's from astern!

500
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,460
Oh, my God.

501
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,470
Gunner... Target engine only.

502
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,220
Captain, what is happening? We're under attack!

503
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,810
Stand by for evasive.

504
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,430
Fire.

505
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,610
I wanted prisoners!

506
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,030
A lucky shot, sir...

507
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:53,950
Animal!

508
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,210
Sir, may I suggest... Say the wrong thing, Torg!

509
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,250
There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.

510
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,840
Saavik calling Grissom... Very good.

511
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,350
Grissom, this is Saavik on emergency frequency. Come in, please.

512
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,310
What happened to them?

513
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:21,190
It would seem the Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.

514
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,660
We must go. They will soon come after us.

515
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:34,700
Estimating Genesis, 2.9 hours present speed.

516
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,130
Can we hold speed, Scotty? Aye, she's got her second wind now.

517
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,050
Scan for vessels in pursuit. Scanning. Indications negative.

518
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,890
Did I get it right?

519
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,430
Great, Bones, just great.

520
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,000
It's time for total truth between us.

521
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:35,680
This planet is not what you intended or hoped for, is it?

522
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,050
Not exactly.

523
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,480
Why?

524
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:44,600
I used proto-matter in the Genesis matrix.

525
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:50,160
An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy

526
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,120
has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.

527
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,000
It was the only way to solve certain problems.

528
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,370
So, like your father, you changed the rules.

529
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,300
If I hadn't, it might have been years, or never!

530
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,640
How many have paid the price for your impatience?

531
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:14,090
How many have died? How much damage have you done?

532
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,850
And what is yet to come?

533
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:01,510
Bridge, nothing happening here.

534
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,500
This planet is ageing in surges. And Spock with it.

535
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,720
It seems they're joined together. They are.

536
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,600
How long?

537
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,680
Days. Maybe hours.

538
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,810
I'm sorry.

539
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,490
It will be hardest on Spock.

540
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,990
Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.

541
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,910
I don't understand. Pon Farr.

542
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:47,870
Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.

543
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,390
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.

544
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,510
I'll go. No.

545
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,550
I'll do it. Give me your phaser.

546
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:17,320
Sir, Starfleet calling USS Grissom. A warning about us.

547
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:22,070
Response? Nothing. As before.

548
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,580
What's the Grissom up to? Will she join us or fire on us?

549
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,870
Chekov, break silence. Send Captain Esteban my compliments.

550
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,010
How are we doing? How are we doing?

551
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,100
Funny you should put it quite that way, Jim.

552
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,480
We are doing fine. But I'd feel safer

553
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:53,270
giving him one of my kidneys than what's scrambled in my brain.

554
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,820
No response from Grissom on any channel.

555
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,240
Keep trying. At regular intervals.

556
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,680
So it has come.

557
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,030
It is called Pon Farr.

558
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,030
Pon Farr.

559
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,830
Will you trust me?

560
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:05,150
We are secured from Warp Speed. Now entering Genesis Sector.

561
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,240
Proceed at impulse power.

562
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,630
Vessel entering sector. Yes.

563
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,970
Federation Battle Cruiser. Have they scanned us?

564
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,220
Not yet.

565
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,760
Engage cloaking device.

566
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:00,550
I'd swear there was something there, sir.

567
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,090
What did you see?

568
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,830
For an instant, a scout class vessel.

569
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,680
Could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency.

570
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,110
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.

571
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:29,280
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?

572
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,950
Spock!

573
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,260
I've come a long way for the power of Genesis.

574
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,090
And what do I find?

575
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:56,020
A weakling human, a Vulcan boy and a woman.

576
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,270
My Lord, we are survivors of a doomed expedition.

577
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,060
This planet will destroy itself soon. The Genesis experiment is a failure.

578
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,820
A failure?

579
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,530
The most powerful destructive force ever created.

580
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:21,410
You will tell me the secret of the Genesis torpedo.

581
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,920
I have no knowledge.

582
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:28,170
Then I hope pain is something you enjoy.

583
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,800
I ordered no interruptions. But, sir...

584
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,270
Federation Starship approaching. Bring me up.

585
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,400
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?

586
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:51,530
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.

587
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,660
Battle Alert!

588
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,950
Grissom, this is Enterprise.

589
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:03,330
Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik.

590
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:06,170
Report status. We are cloaked.

591
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:10,680
Enemy closing on impulse power. Range five thousand kellicams.

592
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:16,090
Good! This is just the turn of luck I have been waiting for.

593
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:28,770
Nothing on my scanner, sir. Short-range scan, Mr Chekov.

594
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,730
Put it on visual, Mr Sulu.

595
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,740
Range three thousand kellicams.

596
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,620
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

597
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,970
Range two thousand kellicams.

598
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,840
Stand by to transfer energy to weapons.

599
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,220
At my command.

600
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:10,770
There! That distortion, see it?

601
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,690
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.

602
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,530
Firing range, sir.

603
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,540
Gunner...

604
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:26,250
Target engine only. Understood?

605
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,670
Understood clearly, sir.

606
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,800
Opinion, Mr Sulu. I think it's an energy surge.

607
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,680
Enough energy to hide a ship? A cloaking device.

608
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,310
Red Alert, Mr Scott.

609
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,260
One thousand kellicams and closing.

610
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,440
All power to the weapons systems.

611
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,270
Wait. Wait.

612
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:54,860
No shields?

613
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:59,290
If my guess is right, they'll have to de-cloak before they can fire.

614
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,650
May all your guesses be right.

615
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:18,050
Klingon Bird of Prey. Arming. Fire, Mr Scott!

616
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,400
Good shooting, Mr Scott.

617
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:36,900
Precautionary, Mr Chekov, shields up.

618
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:47,950
Emergency power to the thrusters!

619
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,920
Sir, the shield's non-responsive. Scotty?

620
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:58,710
The automation system's overloaded. I didn't expect combat, you know.

621
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,920
Fire!

622
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,280
Emergency power. Prepare to return fire.

623
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,940
Mr Scott, can you transfer power to phaser banks?

624
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,990
I don't think so. They've knocked out the automation centre.

625
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:30,660
I've got no control over anything. Mr Sulu?

626
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,920
Nothing, sir.

627
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,260
So... we're a sitting duck.

628
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,090
Ready to fire emergency tube.

629
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,570
Why haven't they finished us? They outgun me ten to one!

630
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,650
My Lord. The enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.

631
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,870
Put them on screen.

632
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:09,570
This is Admiral James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise.

633
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,960
The Genesis Commander himself. A violation of treaty...

634
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,580
...between the Federation and the Klingon Empire,

635
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,580
...your presence here is an act of war.

636
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,260
You have two minutes to surrender your crew and your vessel...

637
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:27,470
...or we will destroy you. He's hiding something.

638
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,800
We may have dealt him a more serious blow than I thought.

639
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,270
How can you tell that? I trust my instincts.

640
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,400
Admiral Kirk, this is your opponent speaking.

641
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,480
Don't lecture me about treaty violations!

642
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:47,690
In creating an ultimate weapon, the Federation has become criminals!

643
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,700
It is not I who will surrender, it is you!

644
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:04,970
On the planet below, I have three prisoners

645
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,760
from the team who developed your doomsday weapon.

646
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:16,230
If you don't surrender, I'll execute them as enemies of galactic peace!

647
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,310
Who is this? How dare you take prisoners?

648
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:24,600
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.

649
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,700
You may speak to them.

650
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:36,410
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik. Saavik!

651
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,340
Is David with you? Yes, and someone else.

652
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:44,550
A Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.

653
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,850
This... Vulcan...

654
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,850
Is he alive?

655
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:56,680
He is not himself, but he lives.

656
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,570
He's subject to rapid ageing, like this unstable planet.

657
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,190
Hello, sir, it's David.

658
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:05,310
I'm sorry I'm late.

659
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,480
I should've known you'd come. It's true, this planet is unstable.

660
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,910
It's gonna destroy itself within hours.

661
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,160
David, what went wrong?

662
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,960
I went wrong. I don't understand.

663
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender.

664
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:25,160
Genesis doesn't work. I can't believe they'd kill us for it.

665
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:29,710
Admiral, your friend is mistaken, I meant what I said.

666
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:34,590
And to show that my intentions are sincere, I shall kill one prisoner.

667
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,850
Wait! Give me a chance to talk...

668
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:40,850
Kill one of them. I don't care which.

669
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,860
Saavik?

670
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,070
David?

671
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:34,910
Admiral... David is dead.

672
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:49,550
You Klingon bastard, you've killed my son.

673
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:59,300
Klingon bastard, you've killed my son!

674
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,870
You Klingon bastard!

675
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:16,450
There are two more prisoners, Admiral.

676
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,150
Do you want them killed, too?

677
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,830
Surrender your vessel.

678
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,720
All right. All right, damn you.

679
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,720
All right.

680
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,970
Give me a minute to inform my crew.

681
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:44,470
I give two minutes to you and your gallant crew.

682
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:57,820
Take every last man, form a boarding party, armed heavily!

683
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,070
They outnumber us, my Lord. We are Klingons!

684
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:04,740
Once you control the ship we will transfer our flag there

685
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,080
and take Genesis from their memory banks.

686
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,970
Mr Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?

687
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:24,890
About a dozen officers and men.

688
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,610
With some of them on the planet.

689
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:34,780
I swear to you, we're not finished yet.

690
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:38,190
Bones, you and Sulu to the Transporter Room, the rest with me.

691
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:40,650
We have a job to do.

692
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:48,000
Commander Klingon vessel. Prepare to board this ship on my next signal.

693
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:52,630
No tricks, Kirk! You have one minute.

694
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,630
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you.

695
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,310
To the Transport Room. Success!

696
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:19,110
Computer, this is Admiral James T. Kirk, requesting security access.

697
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:27,160
Computer, destruct Sequence One, Code: 1...

698
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,210
1 A...

699
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:40,170
Computer, Commander Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineering Officer.

700
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:45,430
Destruct Sequence Two, Code: 11 A 2B.

701
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:56,240
Computer, this is Commander Pavel Chekov, acting Science Officer.

702
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:03,410
Destruct Sequence Three, Code: 1 B2B3.

703
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:07,710
Destruct Sequence completed and engaged.

704
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,040
Awaiting final Code for one-minute countdown.

705
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,170
Code: 000.

706
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,590
Destruct 0.

707
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:24,300
Destruct Sequence is activated.

708
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,190
Kirk, your time runs out.

709
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,480
All set? Aye, sir.

710
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,030
Commander Klingon vessel, we are energising transporter beam, now.

711
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,330
Transporter, stand by!

712
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,410
My Lord, the ship appears to be deserted.

713
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,720
How can that be? They're hiding.

714
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,630
Yes, sir, but the bridge seems to be run by computer.

715
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:50,680
It's the only thing speaking. Speaking? Let me hear.

716
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,560
Nine, eight, seven, six...

717
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,140
...five... Get out! Get out of there!

718
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,020
Get out! ...one...

719
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:01,170
My God, Bones. What have I done?

720
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,430
What you had to do. What you always do.

721
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,590
Turn death into a fighting chance to live.

722
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:16,270
Planet core readings, unstable. Changing rapidly.

723
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,390
What about surface life signs?

724
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,650
There.

725
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,440
No! Don't touch him!

726
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,420
Bones.

727
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:48,500
What happened? He gave his life to save us.

728
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:57,430
Rapid ageing. All genetic functions highly accelerated.

729
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,730
What about his mind? His mind's a void.

730
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:04,270
It seems, Admiral, that I've got all his marbles.

731
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:07,860
Is there anything we can do? Only one thing.

732
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:13,520
Get him off this planet. His ageing is part of what's going on around us.

733
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:42,270
Klingon Commander, this is Admiral James T. Kirk.

734
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,430
I'm alive and well on the planet's surface.

735
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:47,600
I know this will come as a pleasant surprise to you.

736
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:51,400
Our ship was a victim of an unfortunate accident.

737
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:55,530
Sorry about your crew, but as we say on Earth, "C'est la vie".

738
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,330
I have what you want.

739
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,490
I have the secret of Genesis.

740
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:09,950
You're gonna have to bring us up there to get it.

741
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:12,540
Do you hear me?

742
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,090
I'm waiting for you!

743
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,640
What is your answer?

744
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,200
Drop all weapons!

745
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,080
Over there, all but Kirk.

746
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:59,220
Maltz... Prisoners at beam coordinates.

747
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:02,130
You should take the Vulcan too. No!

748
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:05,170
But why? Because you wish it.

749
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:11,770
Maltz... Activate beam!

750
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,150
Genesis. I want it!

751
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,030
Beam the Vulcan up, and we'll talk.

752
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,000
Give me what I want and I'll consider it.

753
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:34,750
Fool! Look around you! The planet's destroying itself!

754
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,460
Yes, exhilarating, isn't it?

755
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,210
If we don't help each other, we'll die here!

756
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,960
Perfect! Then that's the way it shall be.

757
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,400
Give me Genesis!

758
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:09,730
Give me your hand! Kirk!

759
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:18,810
I... have had...

760
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:21,230
...enough of you!

761
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,270
Maltz!

762
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,540
Don't! How many more?

763
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,130
Just him, sir.

764
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,670
Bones, help Spock.

765
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,390
We've got to break out of orbit.

766
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,670
You, help us or die.

767
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:16,260
I do not deserve to live.

768
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:20,140
Fine, I'll kill you later. Let's get out of here.

769
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,910
Where's the anti-matter inducer? This?

770
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,450
No! This!

771
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,570
That or nothing.

772
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:49,130
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.

773
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,510
Go, Sulu.

774
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,520
Goodbye, David.

775
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:10,690
We are clear and free to navigate.

776
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:14,860
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr Chekov, take the prisoner below.

777
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,950
Wait! You said you would kill me. I lied.

778
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:28,260
Spock...

779
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,500
For God's sake, talk to me!

780
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,380
You stuck this damn thing in my head, remember?

781
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,520
Remember?

782
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,860
Now, tell me what to do with it.

783
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:49,070
Help me.

784
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:10,040
I'm gonna tell you something that I...

785
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:14,470
...never thought I'd hear myself say.

786
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,590
But it seems I've missed you.

787
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:27,020
I don't know if I could stand to lose you again.

788
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:47,080
Ambassador, they are on approach.

789
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:50,710
They're requesting permission to land.

790
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,010
Permission granted. Tell them...

791
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:57,250
Tell Kirk we'll be ready.

792
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:07,680
Mr Sulu, you're on manual.

793
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,570
It's been a while, sir. Here we go.

794
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,460
Retrothrusters.

795
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:14,090
Sarek is waiting above, sir.

796
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,820
Sarek...

797
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,730
Child of Skon, child of Solkar...

798
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:30,000
The body of your son breathes still.

799
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,870
What is your wish?

800
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:38,880
I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan. The refusion.

801
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,550
What you seek has not been done since ages past,

802
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,170
and then only in legend.

803
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:50,630
Your request is not logical.

804
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:52,600
Forgive me, T'Lar.

805
01:30:54,190 --> 01:31:00,520
My logic is uncertain where my son is concerned.

806
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:04,860
Who is the keeper of the Katra?

807
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,660
I am.

808
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:12,370
McCoy, Leonard H., son of David.

809
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,030
McCoy, Son of David...

810
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,010
Since thou art human, we cannot expect thee

811
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:22,550
to understand fully what Sarek has requested.

812
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:25,590
Spock's body lives.

813
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:29,590
With your approval, we shall use all our powers

814
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:33,970
to return to his body that which you possess.

815
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:39,850
But McCoy, you must now be warned.

816
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:45,610
The danger to thyself is as grave as the danger to Spock.

817
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,320
You must make the choice.

818
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,200
I choose the danger.

819
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:01,000
Hell of a time to ask.

820
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,280
I'm all right, Jim.

821
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,360
What about Spock?

822
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,410
Only time will answer.

823
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,210
Kirk... I thank you. What you have done is...

824
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:32,420
What I have done...

825
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,050
...I had to do.

826
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,500
But at what cost?

827
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,050
Your ship. Your son.

828
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:45,270
If I hadn't tried... the cost would have been my soul.

829
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:26,360
My father says that you have been my friend.

830
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,620
You came back for me.

831
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:33,790
You would have done the same for me.

832
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:38,670
Why would you do this?

833
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,550
Because the needs of the one...

834
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,770
...outweigh the needs of the many.

835
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:11,830
I have been...

836
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:15,910
...and ever shall be your friend.

837
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,040
Yes.

838
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,220
Yes, Spock!

839
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:25,340
The ship. Out of danger?

840
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,090
You saved the ship.

841
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,260
You saved us all. Don't you remember?

842
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,280
Jim.

843
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,700
Your name is Jim.

844
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:55,370
Yes.
