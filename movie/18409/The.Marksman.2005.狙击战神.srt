6
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,003
It's clear.

I don't know. Let's check it out.
我不知道，咱们去看看

- 向我回报！ - 我们被伏击了，长官

14
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,895

15
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,865
Rodgers, which way?

- 罗杰斯，在哪边？ - 不能确认，长官

17
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,709
Is he jamming our frequency?
难道他们在干扰我们的频率吗？

18
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,607
- Looks like it, sir.   - You're supposed to be jamming his.
- 看来是的，长官  - 应该是你干扰他们的频率？

This is Bandit One, homing in on target vicinity.
这里是空中一号，请帮助我确认目标精确地点

20
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,115
Hightop. Hightop!

21
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,196
I want you to hold this position. Nobody gets in. You got that?
我要你死守这个位置，不许任何人进来，明白吗？

22
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,957

26
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,729

Damn it.
妈的

33
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,768
Training mission is over, and the Painter does it again.
训练结束，成功摧毁目标

Wait here. Be quiet.

40
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,959
Thank you for organizing this in such short notice, everyone.
感谢大家这么仓促前来

41
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:57,001
As I'm sure you can appreciate, we've had a serious situation...
不过我相信你们一定能够理解的，因为在过去的

42
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,900
...come up over the last 12 hours in southern Russia...
十二小时内，发生了一些非常严重的事情

43
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,769

General lgor Zaysan...
伊冈．塞辛将军

45
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:12,285
...an iron fist from the Brezhnev days, Afghanistan, the southern states.
一个强硬人物，活动在阿富汗南部区域

46
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,148
Over the last few years he resurfaced in Chechnya.
过去几年中他在车臣当预备役

47
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:18,951
He made good use of the rebels, considering he's a Russian.
充分利用那里的叛军和俄罗斯的敌对关系

48
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,320
He put together a new army, new weapons.
招兵买马

49
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,261
And now it seems, quite possibly, a nuke.
现在看来，很可能掌握核子武器

50
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,330
Yesterday, he led a band of his rebels across the Terek River...
昨天他带领一支叛军部队越过塔瑞克河

51
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:06,199
...and captured the Kamshev nuclear plant.

...at Kamshev have been decommissioned.

第四个反应炉的燃料棒也被清除了

55
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,180
...but it is capable of going online if it is re-cored.
但是它却可能重新运作，如果有人将它运作的话

56
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:37,267
This would appear to be a Russian problem, Mr. Tensor.
这看起来是俄罗斯的问题

57
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,338
Please, general, let us make no mistake.

...lgor Zaysan is a very dangerous man.

We have been tracking him for a number of years.

61
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:54,245
His hatred for the Kremlin has become a complete obsession.

62
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,089
What's this?
这些人是谁？

63
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,928
- What are you doing with them?   - They are prisoners.

64
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,670
They surrendered when we moved into the plant.
他们是看守工厂的

65
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,068
Where are you taking them?
你带他们去哪里？

66
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,038
Exactly my point.
执行我的计划

67
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,853
If he is capable of re-coring this reactor...
如果他能够把这反应炉重新运作…

68
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,422
...he is capable of detonating it.
…他有这个能力

69
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:38,025
That is to say, potentially 100,000 deaths in an instant.
那意味着，片刻间就可能有十万人死亡

70
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,662
And a few hundred thousand more when the winds...
当风吹过整个地区，将会有数百万或更多的人死去

71
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:45,464
...send the fallout over an area the size of Texas.
相当于得克萨斯州的人口数了

72
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,902
We have proof he's capable of all this?
我们对于那些推测有证据吗？

73
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,804
Amanda, pull up the Flintov picture.
阿曼达，请显示影像

74
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
This surveillance photograph was taken in North Korea.

The Asian is John Lee Kim.
这个亚洲人是张立金

76
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:03,655
He's the ace of hearts in our deck of most-wanted arms dealers.
是我们最想逮捕到的军火贩子

77

...Zaysan's second in command.
他是塞辛的副手

79
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:15,262
Now, it seems that Flintov has plutonium on his shopping list.
好像弗理塔夫也在金的客户名单上

80
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,630
What has Uncle Kim got for sale?

Fuel rods from a failed North Korean reactor.

Will they know what's in it?

87
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,042
You'll see.
解决掉

88
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,659
We are not in the business of doing Russia's dirty work.
我们没工夫理俄罗斯的麻烦事

89
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,632
It's not just the Russians, there are seven scientists...
这不仅是俄罗斯的麻烦，有民间的

90
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,930
...from the private sector working at Kamshev...
七个科学家在那里工作

91
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,040

其中四个是美国人  - 他们怎么到那里去的

92
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,711
The Russians hired them to help decommission the plant.
俄罗斯人雇用他们去瓦解工厂的运作

94
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,141
One of them, Arthur Moffit...
其中一个叫“阿瑟马福特”的

95
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,251
...has stayed in contact with Moscow by cell phone.
通过手机与莫斯科保持联系

96
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:43,355
Latest report suggests he's managed to stay hidden from Zaysan's troops.
最近的报告显示，他好像想办法逃过了塞辛的军队

97
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,082
So let me get the bottom line here.

101
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,769
As you know, Mr. Secretary...

104
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,941
An air strike.
空中轰炸

00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,013
We level the place.

107
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,212

上百人命还是值得牺牲的

108
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,550
General, we're not able to do a large-scale bombing here.
将军，我们不能进行大规模空袭

109
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,592

- 为什么？ - 那个区域的核污染太过严重

110
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:25,026
Unless we do a precise air strike, we risk sending huge clouds...
除非能精确打中目标，否则

111
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,132
...of radioactive dust into the nearby town.
就有向附近村镇扩散大量放射性灰尘的危险

112
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,695
Well, from what I know, these reactors aren't easy to take out.
据我了解，这些反应炉是很难摧毁的

113
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,496
We need to target its weak spot.

What we need is a painter.

- 派出一个目标人物和一队突击队  - 我同意

They could secure the hostages and choose a precise target.
他们可以拯救人质并确定精确空袭地点

117
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,576
It could get real difficult over there.

118
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,415
I have to persuade the president that this plan could work.
我必须说服总统接受这个计划

119
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,987
Do we have any guys with real combat experience?

120
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,984
No, we need someone who's been through this before.
我们需要一个执行过类似任务的人

This man can do it.

122
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,394
Well, I can't see it like that.
嗯，我不能那样看

123
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,861
I just can't see how you'd look at it any other way.
我就是无法理解那还能怎么想呢

124
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,331
- We had our asses kicked.   - Oh, fuck that.
- 我们输了就是输了  - 去你的

125
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,027
One man don't make a team.
一个人不足为惧

126
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,532
No, he ain't nothing without his high-tech shit.
他要是没有那些高科技支持，就什么都不是

127
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,835
Yeah? I'd like to see you say that to his face.
是吗，你敢当着他的面说吗？

128
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:47,207
Oh, fuck you. I say what I want to who I want.
去你的，我想说什么都行

129
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,415
Even the captain?
哪怕跟队长说？

130
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,346
Yeah.
对

131
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,076
See, we're a team.
我们是一个团队

132
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,187
We don't hold our piss, even for captain.

133
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,656
Well, all I know is, he beat every one of us.
我所知道的就是他打败我们所有人

134
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,057
That's gotta count for something.
那总不能不算数吧

135
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,106
- What's up, captain?   - We gotta go.
- 什么事，队长？  - 该走了

136
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,368
We got two suits from D.C. Flying in to give us our mission.
华盛顿有飞机来接我们过去

137
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,442
- What, tonight?   - Yeah.

138
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,574
Let's go.
走吧

139
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,026
We got a mission.
我们有任务了

140
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,429
They're asking for you.
他们要你去

141
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,241
This is the USS Oakla.
美国海军奥卡拉号。地中海

142
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,113
We're in position and conducting maneuvers.
这里是美国海军奥卡拉号，我们己就位

143
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,653
Will advise upon operation commencement.
等待进一步命令

144
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,449
These just came in from our agent in Dagestan.
这是我们在达吉斯坦的情报人员传送过来的

145
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,450
Anshan lmports, one of John Lee Kim's companies.
他们通过张立金的公司进口武器

146
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,356
The shipment's from Namp'o, North Korea?
货是从北韩的南浦港运出的？

147
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,656
- Do we know what it is?   - Certainly big enough for fuel rods.
- 是什么呢？ - 就燃料棒来说当然够大了

148
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,578
The Russians have promised to keep an eye on its movement.
俄罗斯答应监视他们在那里的行动

149
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:36,014
And to stop it once the situation's stabilized.
传输结束，他们说是如此

150
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:39,083
We better have one of our guys keep an eye on it too.
不过我们最好也有一个人盯着点比较放心

151
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,246
It's imperative we take out that last reactor...
在这个货柜到那里之前

152
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,787
...before this container gets there.
我们就要把最后的反应炉拿下

153
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,123
It's amazing.
太神奇了，就是老维克多也没机会

154
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,695
Even old Viktor lvanov's given us his blessing.
但愿他保佑，我们这次能干得漂亮点

155
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,377
Come in.

156
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,056

- 打扰一下，伊万诺夫先生  - 什么事？

157
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,120
The prime minister is ready for us.
总理准备好见我们了

158
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,025
Okay.
好的

159
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,448
Amanda, Jonathan, good to see you.
乔纳森，你好,见到你很高兴

- You too, major.   - This is Captain Naish.
- 我也很高兴见到你，少校  - 这位是纳许队长

161
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,149
He leads the Ranger team we're sending in.
他带领我们这次出击的突击队

- 很高兴见到你，队长  - 我知道你一定准备充分

163
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,232
So you know what you're up against, I thought you better hear this.
不过为了让你进一步了解，还是跟你说明白

164
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,560
It might prove critical. Can you run that for us?
我总是要求比较苛刻，能播放一下这个吗，少校？

165
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,293
Sure. Sergeant.
中士！

166
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,574
The rebels came in and found the others, about five.
叛军就要来了，很快就会找到我们了

167
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,776
Me and Valentina are still in the hospital.
我和瓦伦蒂娜还在医院里

168
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,479
You've got to get us out of here. Please, get us out of here.
你们一定要把我们放出去，求你们救我们出去

169
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,215
They're back.
再见了

170
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,428
That's the voice of Arthur Moffit...
这是阿瑟.马福特的声音

171
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,391
...the lead scientist on the decommissioning team.
解除核工厂运作的科学家小组成员之―

172
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,397
- How do you know if he's still alive?   - We don't.
- 怎么知道他是否还活着？ - 不知道

173
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,503
The rebels haven't even acknowledged that they've taken hostages.
叛军根本没有声明他们有人质

174
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,697
The fact is, we haven't even made contact.
事实上，我们根本没有和他们联络过

175
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,602
And you think they're gonna re-core this reactor?
然后你们认为他们会重新启动那个反应炉

176
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,278
So far, everything points in that direction.
目前为止，我们认为事情正往那个方向发展

177
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,343
Good luck, captain.
祝你好运，队长

178
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,440
Gentlemen.
主要目标是什么？

179
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:08,228
What's my primary target, the hostages or the reactor?
解救人质还是核子工厂？

180
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,234
Both.
两个都是

181
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,063
If there's a choice, which one takes priority?

182
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,471
What are my orders, ma'am?
我的命令是什么？

183
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,511
The reactor.
核子反应炉

184
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,361
Is that it? You wanna say anything more to me?
就那些话吗？没什么话要对我说的吗？

185
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,269
The briefing's over.
询问结束，任务明确了

186
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,441
Damn it, you can talk to me.
见鬼，你可以和我随便谈话的

187
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,075
I'm still here for you.
我还是一直在支持你的

188
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,015
Look, if you want a psych evaluation, you can read the file.
因为关系暖昧而接受精神测试，还不如被开除走人

189
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,943
You wrote it.
那是你写的

190
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,918
It's still there, the same look in your eyes.
还是那样，你眼睛里还是那种表情

191
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:06,021
What look would that be, the one you saw in the inquiry?
那个表情是什么意思？是你在质询的时候看见的？

192
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,450
That's not fair.
这不公平

193
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,388
What do you want from me, Amanda, a thank-you?
阿曼达，你想从我这里得到什么，谢谢你

194
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,095
Okay, thank you.
好！谢谢

195
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,164
You cleaned my record.
你为我填写报告，不过…

196
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,934
Means nothing to those people buried in the ground.
这和那些长眠地下的人已经毫无关系了

197
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,202
It wasn't your fault.
那不是你的错

198
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:23,604
I took the order. I lit the target.
我执行了命令，我指示的目标

199
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,201
That mission was over years ago.
那个任务已经结束很多年了

200
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,109
Those deaths are in the past. Leave them behind.
死者己矣，忘了他们吧

201
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:35,212
That's a good idea.
好主意

202
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,169
Prime minister, hello.
总理阁下，你好

203
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,838
Have you heard from the Americans?
你收到美国人的消息了吗？

204
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,064
They want a rescue and a preemptive air strike.
他们要用空中轰炸并拯救人质

205
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:58,005
- They say it is in our best interests.   - Of course they would.
- 他们说这是对我们最有利的方法了  - 当然会这么说

206
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:02,113
Their newfound obsession has been exhilarating for them.
他们找到新的目标正高兴不己呢

207
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,146
They are asking for us to counter with a ground attack.
他们要求我们地面协助进攻

208
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,384
We can't make that promise.
我们不能答应

209
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,384
Then lie.
对

210
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,580
Let them believe they're in charge.
让他们自己掌握好了

211
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,520
The blame rests on their shoulders.
到时出了事也是他们负责

212
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,288
Has Zaysan found...
塞辛找到了

213
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,734
...what he's looking for?   - It's on its way to him as we speak.
他要找的东西吗  - 正按计划，在送去给他的路上

214
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:26,099
We must let the Americans take out the reactor.
我们一定要让美国人自己砸自己的脚

215
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,703
I'll tell the president.
我会告诉总统的

216
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,476
That reactor's got reinforced concrete.
那个反应炉有加强水泥壁

217
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,479
Sure there's a good spot to take it out?
你确定那是一个好进入地点吗？

218
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,083
I'll find one.
我会找一个合适的地方的

219
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,550
The spec shows a narrow target area for it to implode.
这个仪器能给空中出击确定精确位置

220
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:45,187
It's all about minimal damage on this op.
关键是对这个物体的打击降到最低

221
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,952
We go in, locate the hostages, paint the target...
我们进去，确定人质地点

222
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,426
...and then get out before anyone knows we're there.
带走目标，马上安静的撤出

223
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:52,893
Any questions?
有问题吗？

224
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,068
Yeah. Well, how close on our ass is the air strike?
是的。空军攻击多久会到？

225
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,534
They'll be right on our ass. That's why we gotta make it quick.
方位确定后他们紧跟着就到，所以我们动作一定要快

226
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,900
Well, how hot is it around the reactor site?
叛军如果离得很近怎么办？

227
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:05,703
A small company of Zaysan's loyalists are protecting his ass there.
只有小部分塞辛的忠实部下在那里防守

228
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,513
The rest of the rebel troops are across the river, 20 miles south.
其他叛军在河对岸南面2O英里处

229
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:14,886
Captain, this being a stealth op and all...
队长，这次任务这么危险

230
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,054
...we gotta leave Orin behind.
我们得把伯恩留下

231
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,657
You can see his fat ass a mile away.
因为你在一英里之外都可以看到他的大屁股

232
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,726
Go blow yourself, asshole.
你这个混蛋的屁股才那么大

233
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,993
Quit it. Let's pack and roll, people.
好了，咱们收拾上路吧，伙计们

234
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:58,792
- Jacks here.   - What is happening now?
- 我是杰克斯  - 现在发生什么事？

235
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,192
We're moving forward.
我们开始行动了

236
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,294
The team's on its way.
已经派出突击小组去了

237
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,402
We have a man shadowing the container.
我们另外有一个人在监视货柜车

238
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,469
Our forces are ready to intercept it.
我们的部队已经准备好行动了

239
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,597
Have them hold off until the plant is secured...
让他们等到工厂确保安全之后再行动

240
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,407
...or those hostages are as good as dead.
否则这些人质就死定了

241
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:29,088
Hey, Hargs. Man, I did some checking on him.
嘿，哈克斯，我可以与你核对一下吗？

242
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,320
Total malfunction in Bosnia.
它可不能乱出错

243
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,233
He painted the wrong target.
如果它把我们定位的目标搞错了

244
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,934
We're talking major collateral damage.
后果不堪设想

245
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,352
Yo, what's your name? What do we call you?
你叫什么名字？我们怎么称呼你？

246
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,993
Yeah.
对啊！

247
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,525
What's your name, dude?
你叫什么，伙计？

248
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,426
If it comes to having to save your ass, I wanna know your name.
如果我们连你的名字都不知道，到时怎么救你呢？

249
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:14,130
Worry about saving your ass,I'll worry about saving mine.
如果我是你们的话，还是先担心怎么救自己吧

250
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,710
All right, people, let's roll.
好了，准备跳伞

251
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,629
We're losing the signal.
我们正在失去他们的信号

252
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,695
Must be on a real ride.
一定是风太大了

253
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,527
Those are 70-mile-an-hour wind gusts.
他们的下降速度有70英里时速呢

254
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,334
Is there a problem, major?
有问题吗，少校？

255
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,270
I hope not.
希望没有

256
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,306
Ready to deploy chutes on my mark.
听我命令，打开降落伞

257
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,074
Mark.
注意

258
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,395
Chutes open.
降落伞打开了

259
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,359
Off the target.
达到目的地

260
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,566
Well, there's nothing more we can do to help them now.
现在我们帮不了他们了

261
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,227
They're on their own up there.
他们全靠自己了

262
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,524
Painter.
伙计们？

263
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,924
Hargs.
哈克斯？

264
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:23,458
I took a local reading, sir.
看一下读数，长官

265
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,966
Their comsets are down.
他们都下来了

266
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:28,604
Well, they were due east of us. So let's pack and go.
我们每个人的仪表都要检视一次

267
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,139
Sir.
好了，走吧

268
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,381
This way.

269
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,391

- 早安，秘书长先生  - 早安，约翰

270
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,932
We have a green light, sir. The team's on the ground.
我们目前一切顺利，他们到达地面了

271
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,694
When will the target be lit?
目标什么时候能被定位？

272
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,371
Two hours, at most.
最多两个小时

273
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,336
One of our satellites will pick up the Painter's signal.
我们的一个卫星会接收“定位人”的信号

274
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,000
We have an F-14 standing by off a carrier in the Gulf.
我们有一架F―l4战斗机在海湾的航空母舰上

275
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,577
They're waiting for a go-ahead.
他们在等待命令出动

276
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,578
And the Russians have coordinated...
俄罗斯方面

277
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:46,115
...a offensive move to coincide with the strike.
协助地面行动

278
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,344
Keep me informed, and keep everything on track.
随时给我消息，监控一切任务发展

279
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,784
- Yes, sir, we certainly will.   - Good luck.
- 是，先生  - 祝好运

280
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,821
Thank you, sir. Bye-bye.
谢谢你，先生。再见

281
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,473
Captain Jack Stevens, skipper of the Oakla.
我是杰克斯.蒂文，奥克拉号的船长

282
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,438
- Lt. Randall, sir.   - Lt. Carter, sir.
- 我是雷纳德中尉，长官  - 我是科纳中尉，长官

283
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,870
Colonel Reynolds gave me some details about your mission.
科纳，雷纳德，我对你们的任务有所了解

284
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,843
In fact, too few.
你们两个其实都很杰出

285
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,914
I was impressed with your flight record...
你们的飞行记录，我很欣赏

286
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:56,211
...particularly on the F-14 Tomcat. I do see that you're carrier-qualified.
尤其是在F-l4战斗机的飞行任务表现出色。你们两个的素质确实很适合这次任务

287
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:59,482
But what I don't see is why a Navy pilot can't fly this mission.
但是我不明白的是为什么海军的飞行员不能执行这次飞行任务

288
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,559
The way we see this little get-to, it's an Army problem.
我们的看法是这是陆军的问题

289
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:04,787
So the Army ought to be the one to clean it up.
所以应由我们自己解决

290
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:08,262
- Not good enough, lieutenant.   - The dispatch from Col. Reynolds...
- 这个答案不够好，中尉  - 这是上面的命令

291
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,402
...explains the parameters of this operation, the need for secrecy.
不需要向我们特别解释

292
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,834
I don't give a damn about dispatch, lieutenant.
我才不管是什么任务分配呢

293
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,304
If I'm gonna entrust my airplane to an Army pilot...
我要把心爱的战机借给陆军飞行员

294
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:19,307
...and let him fly in harm's way, then by God, I wanna know why.
任由他们就那么开走，看在上帝的份上，我想知道为什么？

295
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:20,877
Yes, sir.
是，长官

296
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,708
I know the terrain, I know the ground crew.
我了解那个梦想，我了解地面部队

297
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,282
You could let a naval aviator fly this operation...
你可以让一个海军飞行员来执行这次任务

298
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,450
...but the Army needs me.
但是陆军需要我

299
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,184
- Fair enough, lieutenant.   - Roger that, sir.
- 很好，中尉  - 很高兴你这么说，长官

300
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,684
This looks like the hospital.
数据处理，目标区域。这是关押人质的地方

301
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,488
The reactor's less than a mile away.
反应炉在一英里之内了

302
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,440
Go. Go.
上，上

303
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:41,786
Moffit says he was hiding in the hospital.
探测人质方位

304
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,569
He's here.
在这里

305
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,864
Got it going again for you, sir.
附近暂时无人，长官

306
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,406
- Great.   - But Harg's set's dead.
- 很好  - 是哈克斯说的

307
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,544
- Damn.   - What do we do now?
- 泰勒  - 我们现在怎么做？

308
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,110
This way. This way.
这边，这边

309
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:03,613
Go. Go with them.
去，和他一起去

310
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:12,048
Hargs, stay close to the Painter.
哈克斯，和“定位人”保持近距离

311
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:13,748
Sir.

312
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,972
Rodgers, Orin, upstairs.

316
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,429
Clear up here.
这里安全

317
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:08,871
Your nerves shaky?
这里让你感觉不安？

318
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,737
Yeah, a little.
对，是的

319
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,410
Good. Means your instincts are turned on.
很好，那就是你的本能被唤醒了

320
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:38,333
- I found them.   - Please don't hurt us.

321
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,432
Please don't hurt us.

We got bogeys. Three of them, coming right at me.
我们碰到障碍了，他们一起往我这里来

I think they were in the breeder reactor.

There's underground pipe ways that connect to the reactors.

我们到的时候，那些士兵占领了医疗中心

We can't just leave them here.

He's right, captain. These are Americans.

So tell me, how long did you?

你应该仅仅是看着他们，让他们从工厂撤退的

459

No. Valentina made sure of that.

We've blocked the frequency in the area.

We had a deal. I set you up.
我们有协议的，我帮你们设圈套

I put everything in its place the way you wanted.

We appreciate your sacrifices, Mr. Moffit.

You wanna wipe out your Chechen army, fine...
你想扫除在车臣的敌人，没错，但是…

当这里被占领之后，我本不会被留下的

478
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:04,329
I'm touched by your deep sense of self-interest.
那就是你自己的臆想了

479
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:07,569
You promised me the money and safe passage.

You're absolutely right. Safe passage.

我们在莫斯科的朋友会告诉我们，美国人是否联络上

Put guards at the place he targeted.

487
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,705
...and not contact the girl?

He's American.
那个美国人

He's probably watching us now...

...planning his next move.

- 这是最清楚的极限了  - 这还不够

493
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,646
We need to know what happened on that evac.
我们需要知道那次撤退中出了什么事

494
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:05,879
Run it back.

...nobody else. You understand?

501
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:27,370
You're the only one I trust.

502
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,170
Something's off about this mission.
这次任务很不对劲

503
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:33,245
I don't know who's pulling the strings there, but I think we're being set up.

Did you set the target?

What the hell is going on?

508
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:46,026
- Tensor?   - What happened on the evac?

509
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,492
Put Amanda back on.

510
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:49,932
Soldier, talk to me.
士兵，向我报告

511
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:53,169
Talk to me.
告诉我

512
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:07,270
I just...
糟糕

513
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,904
I don't get it.
我真是…不明白

514
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,506
We were on the chopper, and we were clear to go.
我们上了直升机，可以安全离开了

515
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,007
Why would they wait until then to try and waste us?
为什么他们直到那时候才拦住我们？

516
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:17,874
It was all too easy. We just waltzed on in there like we owned the place.
一直都太顺利了，我们好像如入无人之境

517
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:19,845
Yeah, no shit.
对，怎么可能

518
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,518
And these fuckers played us.
这些混蛋耍了我们

519

I mean, what the fuck is going on here, captain?
到底怎么回事，队长？

520
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,315
Let's just concentrate on trying to get us out.

01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:32,189
Take a look around. I don't think so.
看看周围，我觉得不可能

523
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:37,193
- He said something wasn't right.   - Did he give you any proof?
- 他说有什么不对劲  - 他给你什么证明了吗？

524
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,535
No.
不

525
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:43,034
We have to call off the fighter until we figure out what's going on.
但我们要让战斗机暂停行动，直到我们明白出了什么事

526
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,731
- It's not happening, Amanda.   - You heard what he said.
- 不可能，阿曼达  - 你听到他说了

527
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:48,537
I don't think you're an accurate judge in this situation...
由于你们过去的关系，我认为…

528
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:51,112
...not considering your past relationship with him.
你现在下这个判断并不准确

529
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,011
- What's that got to do with it?   - You're too close to him.
- 那和这件事有什么关系？ - 你和他走的太近了

530
01:00:54,385 --> 01:00:56,319
Anyone reasonable would see...
你无法理智判断出

531
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,182
...that there is absolutely no substance to what he's saying.
他所说的话真实性

532
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:02,525
Look...
听着

533
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:05,994
...when the evac chopper went down, he probably got spooked.
当直升机撤退被摧毁的时候，他可能受了严重刺激了

534
01:01:06,197 --> 01:01:10,031
You and I both know, in those kinds of situations, people's nerves get tested.
你和我都清楚，在那种情况下，人们的神经系统受到考验

535
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:15,267
- Nerves?   - That is all it is, Amanda.
- 神经？ - 情况就是那样，阿曼达

536
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,806
Mikhail? I need to ask you a question.
喂？我问你一个问题

537
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,374
Please, go ahead.
请说吧

538
01:01:55,613 --> 01:01:58,104
Have you noticed anything strange about this op?
你觉得最近情况有什么不对劲吗？

539
01:01:58,449 --> 01:01:59,973
How do you mean?
你什么意思？

540
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,444
I can't quite explain it.
我解释不太清楚

541
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:06,348
Does this have anything to do with your call to the Painter?
这和你与杜贝特的电话有关系吗？

542
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:08,688
- You know about that?   - Your intelligence...
- 你知道那件事？ - 你们的间谍

543
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:11,760
...is our intelligence today. Remember?
也就是我们的间谍，记得吗？

544
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:15,130
But I do believe something is strange, as you said.
不过我确实相信如你所说，有事情不对劲

545
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:17,957
Minister lvanov is beside himself with this matter.
伊万诺夫部长今天早上因为这件事焦虑不安

546
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:21,002
- In what way?   - After your helicopter was destroyed...
- 怎么？ - 你们的直升机被摧毁后

547
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:23,070
...I told him there may be a delay.
我告诉他也许你们的空袭行动会延迟

548
01:02:23,274 --> 01:02:26,937
I said it would be a good thing, give us time to intercept the container...
我说这也许是好事，给我们点时间来检查那个货柜

549
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:30,545
...and justify extreme measure of an American air strike on Russian soil.
弥补可能会对俄罗斯土壤造成极端后果的核子污染

550
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:34,148
But he look at me as... As if I spit in his face.
而他看着我，好像… 好像我冲他脸上吐口水似的

551
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,450
What are you trying to say, Mikhail?
你想说的是什么？

552
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:40,055
Look again at the pictures I sent you of the reactors.
你仔细看看我发给你的核子反应炉卫星照片

553
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,919
I'm going to send someone to intercept those planes.
我现在要找人去查一下那辆货柜车

554
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:44,825
Okay.
好的

555
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:07,376
Just to let you know, the Russians are setting up to stop the truck.
阿曼达，跟你说一声，俄罗斯人准备要拦住货柜车了

556
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,568
Secondary target, just in case.
安装第二目标定位器，以防万一

557
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,623
Hey there. Just got your e-mail. What is this?
嘿，刚刚收到给你的电邮。这是什么

558
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:25,420
The nuke plant in Chechnya. It's from a Russian satellite.
俄国卫星拍到的在车臣的一个新工厂

559
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:26,755
Shitty quality.
照片影像很差

560
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:28,832
What do you see?
你看到什么？

561
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:31,567
Am I looking for something in particular?
要找什么特别的目标吗？

562
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:35,332
- I don't know.   - Okay.
- 我不知道  - 好吧

563
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,089
Hello.
你好

564
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,668
Somebody's been Photoshopping.
有人在拍照片

565
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,467
- Where? Show me.   - This shadow.
- 哪里，指给我看？ - 这里，不论是什么

566
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:10,969
Whatever's casting it's been erased.
一定是有类似放射性物质的痕迹

567
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:14,144
Can you check and see if this was covered by one of our satellites?
你能否看看我们的卫星照片是否有拍到它

568
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:18,778
Sure. We'll see what we have on the date the Russians shot this...
当然，那么我们有这张相片在同一天俄国人拍下了这张相片

569
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:21,110
...and the computer will overlay the two...
电脑将两张相片进行对比

570
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:22,979
...and identify any discrepancies.
看能否找到任何的蛛丝马迹

571
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:30,186
Is that what you're looking for?
这是不是你要找的东西呢？

572
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:34,455
Oh, my God. The truck's already been there. We're following a decoy.
天哪，那辆车已经到过那里了。我们跟踪的车是伪装的

573
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:35,962
Get me hard copies.
给我接海军部

574
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:40,798
You're violating Russian airspace. Stand down.
你现在进入了俄国领空，出去

575
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,264
We have clearance from the Russian government.
我进入这里有俄国政府批准的

576
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,030
That's not what we were told.
上头并没有通知我

577
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:49,979
He's trying to lock on. These guys are going hot.
锁定目标…警报。来者不善，接招吧

578
01:05:57,855 --> 01:05:59,482
Let's see if he can catch me now.
现在看你是否追得上我

579
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:08,921
- He's still on our 6.   - I know a few tricks. We'll lose him.
- 他还在我们6岁的时候  - 我不懂你说什么

580
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:17,206
Going for weapons lock.
现在看谁锁定谁

581
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:26,979
Almost there.
好，差不多了

582
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,518
Fire fox one, fire fox one.
发射一号导弹，发射一号导弹

583
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:37,951
Hold on, hold on. Got another.
等等，等等，又来了一个

584
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,759
I see him. Hang on, hang on!
等等，等等

585
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:46,859
- We're losing power.   - Put your poker face on, Randall.
- 我们正在失去动力  - 把备用燃料连上，速战速决

586
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:49,738
Just play a little Texas Hold'em.
警告

587
01:06:59,183 --> 01:07:02,209
- He's got a lock.   - Not for long. Hang on.
- 我们又被锁定了  - 不会太久。坚持

588
01:07:05,756 --> 01:07:07,451
That's more like it.
这回可不会…坐稳了

589
01:07:10,828 --> 01:07:12,625
I almost got a lock.
这回你可跑不掉了

590
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,501
Fire fox two.
发射二号导弹

591
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,907
This is Shadow One. Hostiles taken care of.
这里是阴影一号，问题解决

592
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,792
Hello. May I help you?
你好，有什么需要帮忙吗？

593
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,289
I'm sorry, I was looking for Mikhail Beslan.
抱歉，我找马可.比斯林

594
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:50,997
Mr. Beslan has been reassigned.
比斯林先生暂时停职了

595
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:52,502
Are you sure?
真的吗？

596
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:56,434
Any inquiries about Mr. Beslan shouldbe placed with the Ministry of Defense.
任何询问比斯林先生的电话将被转接到国防部

597
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,665
Thank you.
谢谢！

598
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,652
Painter, this is Hargreaves.
“定位人”，我是哈得利斯

599
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,822
I'm in the tunnel. I got bogeys down here.
我在地下管道里面，我发现了些东西

600
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:50,520
- Yeah.   - Everything is in place, sir.
- 喂？ - 一切就位了，先生

601
01:08:51,028 --> 01:08:52,290
Have they stopped the truck?
他们拦住了卡车吗？

602
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:55,329
Yes, sir. We have the men starting to open it now.
是，先生，我们的人现在正要开箱检查

603
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:59,291
- Let me know when they open it.   - Yes, sir.
- 一打开里面就通知我  - 是，先生

604
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:26,062
Hi. The radiation suits are in the car.
嗨，防辐射器具就在车里

605
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:42,036
Hargs, stay put. I'll find you.
你待着别动，我会来找你

606
01:09:57,961 --> 01:09:59,292
There he is! Let's go!
他在那里，上

607
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:38,763
I know where they're being held. Go, go!
我知道他们关在哪里，快走

608
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:56,277
Give me Jonathan Tensor.
给我接将军办公室

609
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:58,814
The Painter was on to something, so was Beslan.
“定位人”一定知道了什么

610
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:00,846
And now he's been reassigned.
所以他现在根据行动准则将自动更新了任务

611
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:03,720
All right.
那好

612
01:11:04,061 --> 01:11:06,222
Convince me.
说服我

613
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:09,860
Painter said he thought it was a setup.
“定位人”说那是个圈套

614
01:11:10,233 --> 01:11:12,201
Amanda, that could mean anything.
阿曼达，那什么也不能说明

615
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:15,634
What if lvanov planned this whole thing?
如果是伊万诺夫搞的鬼呢？

616
01:11:16,006 --> 01:11:18,668
What if he set us up to go in like cowboys, thinking...
如果他引诱我们去那里

617
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:22,105
...we were taking out a reactor before Zaysan could re-core it...
让我们以为自己是在塞辛重新启动反应炉前摧毁它

618
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:24,576
...only, it's already been re-cored.
但其实它已经被重新启动了呢？

619
01:11:24,815 --> 01:11:26,806
That's what they're unloading off this truck.
所以他们才会在那里卸下这辆车

620
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:31,345
What could lvanov possibly gain from something so insane?
计划这么疯狂的事对伊万诺夫有什么好处？

621
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:33,349
He's a hard-liner.
他是强硬派人物

622
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:37,718
He's fallen in with the new Russia, but he doesn't like it. We know that.
表面上服从俄罗斯新秧序管制，但心存不满。这我们都知道

623
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:41,688
Imagine what would happen if we hit a live reactor.
想像一下，如果我们击中运作中的反应炉，会发生什么事

624
01:11:42,032 --> 01:11:43,932
It'd be hundreds of thousands dead.
几百万人将会死亡

625
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:47,132
Think where the blame would fall, the country that caused it...
想想国际舆论会如何谴责那个导致如此后果的国家

626
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:49,305
...and the country that allowed it to happen.
以及允许这事发生的国家？

627
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,600
And political control of Russia would be up for grabs.
俄罗斯的政治秧序又会瓦解了

628
01:11:54,845 --> 01:11:57,905
Something has been bothering me from the start.
从一开始我就觉得有什么不对劲

629
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:01,044
Usually you have to drag everything out of the Russians...
通常我们必须从俄国的盒子里抢食物才行

630
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:02,980
...but this time they handed it to us.
但这次他们却双手奉上控制权到我们面前

631
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:05,552
And every bit of it was through Viktor lvanov.
而又全都是通过维克多伊万诺夫的管道

632
01:12:05,756 --> 01:12:08,725
I give you this, it's crazy enough to be possible...
我的结论是，这简直疯狂得有点可信

633
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,450
...except for one small detail.   - What's that?
除了一个小细节  - 是什么？

634
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,027
The Russians stopped the container an hour ago.
俄罗斯人一小时之前拦住了卡车

635
01:12:14,231 --> 01:12:18,133
From the outside, it tested positive for radioactive levels.
从外面检测的结果，是有放射性物质

636
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:21,635
The specialists are in the process of opening it now.
专家正在开箱检查

637
01:12:23,974 --> 01:12:26,499
Don't look so devastated.
不要感到这么失落

638
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:29,507
I think your assumptions are reasonable.
我觉得你的推测很有道理

639
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:31,713
You're doing a terrific job, Amanda.
阿曼达，你的工作表现非常好

640
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,042
Everybody's very impressed.
我们都有目共暗

641
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:44,224
This is it. They're being kept inside.
就是这里！他们被关在里面

642
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:48,364
Right there.
就在那里面

643
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,594
We gotta get out of here.
我们得出去

644
01:14:34,104 --> 01:14:36,072
The fighter's about to enter Russian airspace.
战斗机朝俄军基地去了

645
01:14:36,273 --> 01:14:39,367
- How long till we hit the target?   - Thirteen minutes.
- 多久之后对目标进行攻击？ - l3分钟

646
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:48,045
Still on approach. ETA from target zone: 12 minutes.
正在接近中，预计到达时间还有l2分l2秒

647
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:02,530
Get away! Don't touch it!
走开，别碰它

648
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,766
There could be static on your hand.
万一被你搞坏了

649
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,731
It could shorten out the target.
锁定的目标就被转移到别处去

650
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:19,640
Everyone will understand your sacrifice, Andre.
大家都理解你的牺牲，安卓恩

651
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,744
I'll make certain of it.
抱歉！我也造成了其中的一部分

652
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:27,889
Soon, this pathetic Chechnya will be a forgotten wasteland.
很快，这个车臣将会成为被遗忘的废墟

653
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:31,586
And our Mother Russia will be great again.
而俄罗斯呢？将会再次强大

654
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:38,960
The guards are dead. The Americans have escaped.
守卫死了，美国人逃走了

655
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:41,702
It's time.
也差不多到时候了

656
01:15:42,505 --> 01:15:43,938
Don't worry.
别担心

657
01:15:44,341 --> 01:15:47,833
I will make sure nobody comes here.
我保证没人能进来捣乱的

658
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:58,083
Pull back. Pull back. Come on.
撤退！撤退！快

659
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:00,616
We gotta get 1000 yards away from that reactor.
我们要离那个反应炉越远越好

660
01:16:23,446 --> 01:16:25,914
Naish, keep your men moving. I'll catch up.
纳许，让你的人继续撤离

661
01:16:26,316 --> 01:16:27,715
Stay clear of the village hall.
我会跟上，保持联络好吗？

662
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:31,143
- What are you talking about?   - It's where I lit the secondary target.
- 你说什么呢？ - 我要启动第二目标定位

663
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,515
Who the hell told you to light a secondary target?
谁让你去引导第二目标点了

664
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:36,851
This mission was off. Primary target was a setup.
这次任务结束了。主要目标点，确定是一个圈套

665
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,119
What the fuck are we standing around here for?
我们到底是来干嘛？

666
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:42,526
- Our orders were for us...   - To target a dormant reactor.
- 我们的任务是  - 占领反应炉

667
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,991
- This one has a live core in it.   - A what?
- 这是运作中的反应炉  - 什么？

668
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:48,466
They used the hostages to re-core the third reactor before we got here.
他们在我们来之前，已经利用人质启动了第三反应炉

669
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,569
Dead hostages had edema in their eyes.
那些人质的眼睛就是证明

670
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:53,875
- The fuck is edema?   - First signs of radiation sickness.
- 为什么？ - 那种现象是放射线造成的第一反映

671
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,074
I hadn't figured it out until I saw...
我是直到撤退被阻的时候才想明白的

672
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:59,009
...that we were being shadowed on the way back to the evac.
我可不知道，难怪…

673
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:02,150
Moffit did lead us through like we owned the place.
我们进来时，感觉就像是自己的地盘一样

674
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:05,684
Look, we played right into Zaysan's fucked-up plan.
你们看，塞辛的计划被我们打乱了

675
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:08,284
Now, I gotta deactivate that primary core.
现在我要去解除第一目标的信号

676
01:17:08,491 --> 01:17:11,892
No, man. We ain't changing the op because you got a hunch.
不会吧！就因为你的什么预感，就要我们改变目标？

677
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:15,758
I guess you're gonna have to shoot me, huh?
难道你要朝我开枪吗？

678
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,489
I gotta do what's right.
那么就这么办吧

679
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:22,194
- I'm out of here, captain.   - Rodgers.
- 我要走了  - 罗杰斯！

680
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:26,341
Sir, I think he's right.
长官！我觉得他是对的！

681
01:17:29,946 --> 01:17:31,709
Go.
去吧！

682
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,710
There is another container in the truck.
车上是否有个柜子？

683
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,276
Well, get it open.
我们可以打开的

684
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,901
Now acquiring target coordinates. Locking on to signal.
确认目标地点，锁定信号

685
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,827
Target is in that dome right there.
第一目标定位就在里面

686
01:18:54,264 --> 01:18:56,027
How you gonna deactivate it?
要怎么解除它的信号？

687
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,756
Electrical charge shuts it down.
把电池拿掉就行了

688
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:01,503
Missile gets diverted to the secondary target.
这样就自动转移到第二目标定位点

689
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:06,072
Well, we're not getting through that.
我们进不去那里的

690
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:09,868
How much C-4 did you pack up?

How long till firing now?

- 6分钟，长官  - 很好

693
01:20:00,363 --> 01:20:01,694
Still on approach vector.

694
01:20:34,631 --> 01:20:37,498
Hold this position. I'm going up top.

I can hold them up from here, sir.

696
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:16,695
Take out the jeep!
快去占领制高点

697
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:19,967
- How much time now?   - Less than two minutes.

700

What is it?
那里面是什么？

701
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:31,197
Someone irradiated dead pigs.
死鱼的尸体

702
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:34,204
It's the container.
装在货柜里

703
01:23:47,957 --> 01:23:49,424
We gotta call off the fighter.
叫战斗机停止

704
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:51,885
Do it.
快照做！

705
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,628
Missile away.
发射

706

Too late. The missile's on its way.

707

01:25:10,907 --> 01:25:12,568
No!
不！

712
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:24,912
That son of a bitch did it.
那个家伙成功了

713
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:24,610
You look like shit too.

Amanda, what is it?

They're saying it's suicide.

看起来他也被陷害背黑锅了

718
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:47,288
If the missile hadn't diverted, the Kremlin would be in chaos.
如果导弹没有转向，克里姆林宫现在就可要爆炸了

719

God knows how deep this really goes.

I'll be leaving for Washington in the morning.

- 相信我们两个都没能让我放开那一段过  - 去！

727

Well, when they do...

...piece of advice from my experience:

Don't get too close to the person asking the questions.
不要离得太近，除非那个人先向你提出这个问题

730

Is that so?

对

732

Because when you do...
因为当你太接近的时候

733
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:08,705
...then they're gonna have to answer to me.
那么它们就要符合我的标准才行

734

My flight's not for eight hours.
