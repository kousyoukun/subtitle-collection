Through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights,

the Cleric has determined

386

that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle

is a statistically predictable element.

388

MAN: The Gun Kata treats the gun as a total weapon,

389

The difference of a 63%/¡£ increase to lethal proficiency

makes the master of the Gun Katas

It seems to me that...

513
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:57,929
at least some of these animals ought to be tested for disease.

If there's an epidemic in the Nether,

515

it's best we know about it.

They were Resistance.

518
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:12,978
They could have led us to the Underground.

But instead of apprehension and interrogation,

520
00:45:14,786 --> 00:45:15,753
they were slaughtered.

521
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,983
Yes, but, Cleric, given the circumstances,

522
00:45:19,057 --> 00:45:20,649
the Father has decreed

523
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:24,126
that there will be no more "process" for sense offenders.

524
00:45:24,195 --> 00:45:26,595
They are either to be shot on sight

525
00:45:26,664 --> 00:45:28,154
or incinerated without a trial.

526
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:29,358
But it's counter to law.

You're a member of the Council. If...

It is not the will of the Council,

it is the will of Father... and he is law.

Sir...

without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem...

that while you... and even I... may not always agree with it,

it is not the message that is important,

536
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:58,190
it is our obedience to it.
