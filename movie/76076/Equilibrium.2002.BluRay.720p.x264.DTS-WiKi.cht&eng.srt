你不喜歡之前的樣子嗎?
You didn't like the way it was before?

沒啥感覺

你為何不把那個留下

給證物組的人採集登記?

你知道,培斯頓...
You know, Preston...

如果我們繼續燒燬這些違禁品

481
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,150
到最後就什麼也沒得燒了
eventually there won't be anything left to burn.

737
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,065
但我知道他已經死了...
But I understand that he's dead...

738
01:04:55,133 --> 01:04:58,762
被你在耶和華的朋友殺死的
killed by your friends at the Tetragrammaton.

739
01:04:58,836 --> 01:05:01,532
不是被我的朋友殺死的
Not by my friends.

740
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,267
是被我
By me.

741
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,640
啊!
Aaah!

742
01:05:47,852 --> 01:05:49,319
你們曾是戀人
You were lovers.

743
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:04,723
[Door closes]

744
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:10,032
地下組織是我們的反對者
The Underground is our foe,

745
01:06:10,108 --> 01:06:12,668
比那些拒用情感控制劑的人
and greater than even the threat

746
01:06:12,744 --> 01:06:16,612
對我們的威脅大得多的是
of those who have forsaken their Prozium for emotion

747
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:21,778
一群聯合在一起的情感犯
is the threat of those selfsame individuals united.

748
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:24,617
他們是個秘密組織...
They are the secret organization...

749
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:33,096
所以,神父下了手諭
And thus, it is in the writing of the Father

750
01:06:33,164 --> 01:06:34,927
要我們找出我們最大的...
that we find our greatest...

751
01:06:36,801 --> 01:06:38,666
下午好,長官
Good afternoon, sir.

752
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:41,637
您來是想要什麼?
What will it be for you?

753
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,435
最新的控制劑?
The latest copy of the inserts?

754
01:06:43,507 --> 01:06:45,668
更新的宣言?
Revised edition of the manifesto?

755
01:06:45,743 --> 01:06:46,767
艾洛·帕崔吉
Errol Partridge.

756
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:49,404
你知道些他的什麼情況?
What do you know about him?

757
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,811
您說什麼?
I beg your pardon?

758
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,746
都出去,快點
Everyone out. Now.

759
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:08,531
我再問你一次
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

760
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:11,227
艾洛·帕崔吉... 你知道他些什麼情況?
Errol Partridge... what do you know about him?

761
01:07:11,302 --> 01:07:14,169
您肯定是弄錯了...
I'm sure this must be some mis...

762
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,502
- 你是個情感犯 - 我不是
- You're an offender. - I'm not.

763
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,441
不是? 那你為什麼這麼怕我?
No? Then why are you so scared of me?

764
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:22,570
現在,你得告訴我你所知道的 艾洛·帕崔吉的所有情況
Now, you will tell me everything you know about Errol Partridge,

765
01:07:22,646 --> 01:07:24,580
不然我就把你抓起來
or I will have a wagon come to take you

766
01:07:24,648 --> 01:07:27,481
送去毀滅堂燒掉
to the Hall of Destruction for summary combustion.

767
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:29,678
我...真的不知道...
[Breathing heavily] L-I really don't know...

768
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,846
說!
Speak!

769
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:34,516
他...他曾經跟一個叫吉根的人一起來過
He... he'd come in here with a fellow named Jurgen.

770
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:35,854
為什麼來?
Why?

771
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:39,020
我...我就知道這麼多,我發誓
That's... that's all I know. I swear.

772
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,085
吉根!
Jurgen!

773
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:02,615
有意思
Interesting.

774
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,820
- 呃-哦! - 呃!
- Ugh-ow! - Ugh!

775
01:08:07,123 --> 01:08:09,489
[Groans]

776
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:14,085
[Gun cocks]

777
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,718
我們監視你很久了, 培斯頓
We've been watching you, Preston.

778
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:51,231
你是吉根
You're Jurgen.

779
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,567
你有情感
You're feeling.

780
01:09:09,954 --> 01:09:12,047
知道你為什麼要來嗎?
Do you know why you came?

781
01:09:17,727 --> 01:09:20,218
[Buzzes]

782
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:37,339
歡迎來到地下
Welcome to the Underground.

783
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:49,349
波動器
Polygraph.

784
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:53,362
它能探測人情感的波動
It detects fluctuations of human emotion.

785
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,591
我們必須要肯定
We have to be sure.

786
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,228
瑪麗
Mary.

787
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,907
你左口袋裡有
You're carrying in your left pocket

788
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:13,916
帶著她的體香的紅絲帶
a red ribbon sprayed with her scent.

789
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:18,051
在你覺得沒有人會看到的地方
You breathe it in sometimes

790
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:21,023
你會時不時的聞聞它
when you think there's no one to see.

791
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:25,027
但是你的情感...
But what you feel...

792
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,620
你的情感只有
what you feel could only be satisfied

793
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:30,326
在你全心愛上她的時候 才能得到滿足
by falling yourself into her.

794
01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:39,238
她已經被安排焚化了...
She's scheduled for combustion...

795
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,471
明天
tomorrow.

796
01:10:47,351 --> 01:10:49,478
我知道
I know.

797
01:10:50,854 --> 01:10:53,186
你知道,我很像你
You know, I was like you.

798
01:10:53,257 --> 01:10:57,216
但是你需要瞭解的關於 情感的第一件事
But the first thing you learn about emotion

799
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,660
就是它有它的代價...
is that it has its price...

800
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,631
就像個潘多拉魔盒
a complete paradox.

801
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,567
但是沒有壓抑...
But without restraint...

802
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,866
沒有控制...
without control...

803
01:11:07,938 --> 01:11:09,872
情感就是混亂
emotion is chaos.

804
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,999
但那有什麼區別...
But how is that diff...

805
01:11:12,076 --> 01:11:15,568
不同的是當我們想擁有情感的時候
The difference being is that when we want to feel,

806
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,773
我們能擁有
we can.

807
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:21,443
只不過...
It's just that...

808
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:25,386
我們中有些人...
some of us...

809
01:11:25,456 --> 01:11:27,720
我們中有些人不得不放棄這種奢侈
some of us have to forgo that luxury

810
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,919
才能讓其他的人享受到
so that the rest can have it.

811
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,054
我們中的極少數
Some very few of us

812
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:37,066
必須強迫自己不要有情感
have to force ourselves not to feel.

813
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:39,996
像我這樣
Like me.

814
01:11:41,872 --> 01:11:43,840
像你那樣
Like you.

815
01:11:48,946 --> 01:11:50,846
我能做什麼?
What can I do?

816
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,543
你能殺了神父
You can kill Father.

我聽到了最讓我不安的謠傳
I've heard the most disturbing rumor.

825

01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,978
謠傳說我們中有個人
A rumor maintaining that one of us,

情感,長官?
Feeling, sir?

833
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:16,527
你是在耍我嗎, 教士?!
Are you playing with me, Cleric?!

不,長官
No, sir.

836
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:31,904
我聽說這個人

正在試圖與叛軍聯繫

838
01:13:37,721 --> 01:13:41,213
告訴我,如果你願意的話
Now tell me, if you'll be so kind,

839
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,156
你到底...
how exactly...

840
01:13:43,227 --> 01:13:46,390
在你遲到的這段時間都做了些什麼
have you been making use of your time of late?

841

嘗試同叛軍聯繫,長官
Attempting to contact the Resistance, sir.

842
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,078
嘗試?
Attempting?

843
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:07,941
你怎麼能查出這個叛徒
How is it that you intend to expose this traitor

844
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:11,044
如果你只是在"嘗試"?
if all you do is attempt?

845
01:14:16,426 --> 01:14:18,121
你是...
You're...

那當然了
Of course I am.

849
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:31,674
教士們是最後的防線
The Cleric is the final line of defense.

850
01:14:31,742 --> 01:14:34,040
如果叛軍瓦解了他們

01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,545
我們就完了

01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:07,463
是的,很滿意
Yes, I am.

晚安,爸爸
Good night, Dad.

我不明白
MARY: I don't understand.

868
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,708
我的處決都已經定下來了
My execution's set.

869
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:21,216
你還來做什麼?

你不要用藥嗎?
Aren't you gonna dose?

01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:00,715
你...
What...

877
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:05,922
你想怎麼辦?
What'll you do?

878

880
01:17:45,169 --> 01:17:47,603
那接見怎麼樣?你能安排一次接見嗎?
What about an audience? Can you arrange to meet with him?

881
01:17:47,671 --> 01:17:49,662
神父在劇變後就從來沒有接見過任何人
Father's never given a single audience since the upheaval.

882
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,298
暗殺的危險太大了
