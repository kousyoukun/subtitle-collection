1
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,650
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,750
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,150
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,650
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,050
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,750
Da-da.

7
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,450
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

8
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,850
You see this mark?

9
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,450
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,950
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,850
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,550
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,550
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,350
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,650
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,650
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,150
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,750
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,150
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,650
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,850
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,250
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,850
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,650
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

26
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,950
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,150
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,850
Two, three!

29
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,750
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,850
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,950
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,450
Alakay?

33
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,350
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,250
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,550
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,850
Itjust gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,150
Daddy!

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,150
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,550
Alakay!

40
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,150
Da-da!

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,650
No! No! No!

42
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,850
Alakay!

43
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,650
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,050
Da-da!

45
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
Alakay!

46
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,250
Daddy!

47
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,150
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

48
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,650
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

49
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,650
Take me to a place
where they know my name

50
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,050
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

51
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,250
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

52
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,950
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

53
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,150
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,250
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

55
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,750
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

56
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,550
Play thatjungle fever
Show 'em some love

57
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,650
Show love

58
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,150
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

59
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,850
To relate to, to relate to

60
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,650
I'm feeling right at home

61
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,950
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

62
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,450
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

63
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,950
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

64
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,350
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

65
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,550
He's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,950
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,350
Roar!!

68
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,050
The King of New York City...

69
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,150
...Alex the Lion!

70
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,450
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,550
The guy's an animal.

72
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,650
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

73
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,650
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,250
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,550
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

76
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,750
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,050
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,250
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,250
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

80
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,550
to have the animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,950
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

82
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,650
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,850
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

84
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,450
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,550
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

86
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,150
I like to move it, move it

87
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,050
He likes to move it, move it

88
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,050
She likes to move it, move it

89
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,850
- We like to
- Move it!

90
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,350
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

91
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,150
- We like to
- Move it!

92
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,650
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

93
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,150
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

94
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,250
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

95
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,950
Seriously though, call. OK?

96
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,050
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

97
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,150
You can't leave without this!

98
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,550
Surprise, freaks!

99
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,350
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,250
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

101
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,650
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

102
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,850
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

103
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,950
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

104
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,650
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,050
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

106
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,050
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

107
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,150
...Stevie will be in charge!

108
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,050
I don't think they like that idea.

109
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,350
What are you saying, Stevie?

110
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,250
No.

111
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,850
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

112
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,750
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

113
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,850
Let them eat cake!

114
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,850
King Julien, wait for me!

115
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,150
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

116
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,250
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

117
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,450
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

118
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,550
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

119
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,550
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

120
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,050
- Struts.
- Check.

121
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,250
- Flaps.
- Check.

122
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,950
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

123
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,050
You guys!

124
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,550
Copsie-daisy!

125
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,550
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

126
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,050
But it'll have to do. Attention.

127
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,750
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,950
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

129
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,950
then kiss your... good-bye.

130
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,150
New York City, here we come!

131
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,950
Pray to your personal God
this hunk ofjunk flies.

132
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,150
Personal God, hunk...? What?

133
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,550
We are go, sir.

134
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,750
Open the door! I'm outside!

135
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,750
If cabin pressure is lost,

136
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,550
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

137
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,750
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,250
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

139
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,950
Launch!

140
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,150
- Launch!
- Launch!

141
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,450
Gremlin!

142
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,350
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,550
Hi!

144
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,750
That was weird.

145
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,050
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

146
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,150
You got Madagascar on the brain.

147
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,750
I know I'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,250
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,950
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,450
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,250
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,150
Are the butts next to the croutons?

153
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,450
You don't need to be sarcastic.

154
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,950
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

155
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,050
Breeding program?

156
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,350
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

157
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,850
Settle down, have a relationship.

158
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,050
I can see that.

159
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,350
What? Like dating?

160
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,950
Yeah, dating.

161
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,550
Other... other guys?

162
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,850
What do you mean, other guys?

163
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,750
Darn it!

164
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,850
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

165
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,050
I'm gonna go check.

166
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,550
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

167
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,550
It's so funny!

168
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,650
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

169
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,950
To laugh!

170
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,750
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

171
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,650
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

172
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,050
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

173
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,850
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

174
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,650
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

175
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,850
We were checking on our drink order.

176
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,050
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

177
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,750
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

178
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,350
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

179
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,550
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

180
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,450
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

181
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,950
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

182
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,550
Skipper, look.

183
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,350
Analysis.

184
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,550
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

185
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,850
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

186
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,850
That too, sir.

187
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,250
Right! Rico?

188
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,550
Manual!

189
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,350
Problemo solved.

190
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,850
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

191
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,550
We've lost engine one...

192
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,350
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

193
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,150
Buckle up, boys.

194
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,750
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

195
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,350
Attention! This is your captain.

196
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,050
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

197
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,350
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

198
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,250
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

199
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,350
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

200
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,150
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

201
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,850
I can fly!

202
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,750
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

203
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,950
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

204
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,550
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

205
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,450
I broke your iPod!

206
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,150
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

207
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,550
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

208
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,450
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

209
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,250
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

210
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,350
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

211
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,550
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

212
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,250
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

213
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,250
Rico, you've had your fun.

214
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,550
Pull up.

215
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,150
Gear down.

216
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,350
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

217
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,250
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

218
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,350
I said, kiss it!

219
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,550
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

220
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,250
I believe that's checkmate.

221
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,950
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

222
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,950
Oh, we're here.

223
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,850
What in the world?

224
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,650
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

225
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,150
I'm OK. I'm alive.

226
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,250
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

227
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,350
Kowalski, casualty report.

228
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,350
Two passengers unaccounted for.

229
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,350
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

230
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,050
Who says a penguin can't fly?

231
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,050
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

232
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,750
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

233
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,650
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

234
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,750
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

235
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,750
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

236
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,550
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

237
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,850
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

238
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,650
How do you estimate that?

239
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,250
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

240
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,550
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

241
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,950
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

242
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,450
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

243
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,550
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

244
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,450
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

245
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,250
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

246
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,150
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

247
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,050
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

248
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,450
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

249
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,550
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

250
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,550
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

251
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,350
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

252
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,450
You know, grit and spit and spit.

253
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,350
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

254
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,650
That don't sound too promising.

255
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,250
You're right. We're stuck here.

256
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,350
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

257
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,750
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

258
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,150
Behold! The lion!

259
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,850
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

260
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,250
Wait, wait, wait! People!

261
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,150
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

262
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,950
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

263
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,650
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

264
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,250
I know you!

265
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,350
You.

266
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,450
It's the bad kitty.

267
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,450
How do you like some of that?!

268
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,650
Come in, Tokyo!

269
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,850
Right in the batteries.

270
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,750
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

271
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,150
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

272
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,550
Thank you, dear.

273
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,150
Moving on!

274
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,650
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

275
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,950
Out of my mind?

276
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,850
Who's out of my mind now?

277
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,250
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

278
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,650
Out of my mind. We're going home.

279
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,350
Message E-4.

280
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,250
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

281
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,850
Please try again later.

282
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,850
Am I trippin'?

283
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,350
All those zebras... like me.

284
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,050
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

285
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,750
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

286
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,350
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

287
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,650
Africa?

288
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,250
It's got to be.

289
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,050
Our ancestral crib.

290
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,550
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

291
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,250
No, it's more than that. It's like...

292
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,450
...déj?vu, like I've been here before.

293
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,250
It's like Roots!

294
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,950
No, it's like...

295
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,450
...déj?vu, like I've been here before.

296
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,750
How!

297
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,950
How!

298
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,450
Me Alex!

299
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,950
Me and me friends fly,

300
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,250
fly in great metal bird.

301
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,950
Then plummet!

302
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,250
Smash ground!

303
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,750
Go boom!

304
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,150
Then here we emerge.

305
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,450
We offer only happiness

306
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,250
and good greetings.

307
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,650
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

308
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,150
Yeah. We just... yeah.

309
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,150
I thought... Sorry.

310
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,350
You came from off the reserve?

311
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,450
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

312
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,850
Don't strain yourself.

313
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,250
What's going on here?

314
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,050
They say they're from off the reserve.

315
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,550
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

316
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,750
You look familiar. Do I know you?

317
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,350
How could you survive the hunters?

318
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,750
We didn't see any hunters.

319
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,650
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

320
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,950
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

321
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,550
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

322
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,950
Is there a manager we could talk to?

323
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,050
I see. You're here to challenge me!

324
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,850
What? No! No.

325
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,750
That's what it looks like to me!

326
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,350
Zuba! Wait.

327
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,350
I'm trying to take care of business...

328
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,050
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

329
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,050
Alakay?

330
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,150
Is that you?

331
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,750
No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

332
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,150
Zuba, look!

333
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,150
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

334
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,550
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

335
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,250
A mark.

336
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,850
All right, this is a little weird.

337
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,050
Honey, he's come home.

338
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,050
What?

339
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,050
You've come home.

340
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,450
Son.

341
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,750
Dad.

342
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,850
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

343
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,250
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

344
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,850
I got a mom and dad!

345
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,450
My baby's alive!

346
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,050
Dad!

347
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,950
My son!

348
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,250
My son is home!

349
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,250
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

350
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,750
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

351
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,250
I thought you hated Zuba.

352
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,050
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

353
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,650
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

354
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,250
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

355
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,150
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

356
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,050
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

357
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,750
New York!

358
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,050
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

359
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,350
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

360
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,750
This calls for a celebration!

361
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,650
Maurice, I think they like me.

362
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,250
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

363
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,650
Chukka-chukka what?

364
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,250
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

365
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,750
Hey, Marty!

366
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,250
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

367
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,950
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

368
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,750
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

369
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,850
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

370
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,350
What? You don't have doctors here?

371
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,950
Not anymore.

372
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,450
Well, what if you catch a cold?

373
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,650
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

374
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,450
You guys really need a doctor.

375
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,650
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

376
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,250
Me? A doctor?

377
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,550
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

378
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,650
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

379
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,250
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

380
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,350
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

381
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,550
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

382
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,650
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

383
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,450
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

384
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,150
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

385
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,050
Roar!

386
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,250
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

387
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,150
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

388
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,650
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

389
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,150
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

390
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,550
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

391
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,650
How do I look?

392
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,950
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

393
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,550
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

394
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,350
Voil? He's a witch doctor!

395
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,950
My mother will be so happy.

396
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,950
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

397
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,750
Here he comes.

398
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,350
I like 'em big

399
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,750
I like 'em chunky

400
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,950
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

401
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,750
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

402
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,050
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

403
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,450
Goodness, girl... you huge.

404
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,750
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

405
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,250
You as quick as you are hefty.

406
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,850
So you're Moto Moto?

407
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,150
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

408
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,050
I kind of like it, fatso.

409
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,350
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

410
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,750
Cops!

411
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,050
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

412
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,550
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

413
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,050
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

414
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,750
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

415
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,950
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

416
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,450
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

417
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,850
I forgot about the rite of passage.

418
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,150
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

419
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,750
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

420
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,550
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

421
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,350
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

422
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,550
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

423
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,450
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

424
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,250
I want to be Alaki.

425
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,650
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

426
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,350
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

427
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,150
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

428
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,450
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

429
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,750
That's my boy!

430
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,950
I'm a private dancer

431
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,450
A dancer for money

432
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,350
Any old music will do

433
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,050
Beautiful, isn't it?

434
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,150
It's amazing.

435
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,350
Guys...

436
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,050
...this is where we belong.

437
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,150
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

438
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,250
Oh, I like that one.

439
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,050
It works on many levels.

440
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,950
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

441
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,550
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

442
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,450
Stations.

443
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,450
Stage one. Go!

444
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,050
Oh, no! What have I done?

445
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,650
Come on, take the bait.

446
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,350
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

447
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,950
Is it dead?

448
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,150
Stage two! Go, go, go!

449
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,350
I will give him the kiss of life.

450
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,050
Rico!

451
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,050
Rico!

452
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,650
Reverse!

453
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,750
Gas!

454
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,050
Music!

455
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,450
No! Stop! Stop!

456
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,450
Stop!

457
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,950
Come back!

458
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,750
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

459
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,050
Is she dead?

460
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,850
No!

461
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,950
You hoodlums!

462
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,750
Good heavens! Are you OK?

463
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,050
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

464
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,850
My handbag. Such a good boy.

465
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,150
Nana can't survive without it.

466
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,350
You are one tough cookie.

467
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,450
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

468
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,250
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

469
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,950
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...

470
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,150
Where are you going?

471
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,550
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

472
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,450
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

473
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,250
Please! We need to stay...

474
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,150
...together.

475
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,250
Fine! We'll go that way!

476
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,950
Does anyone want a hard candy?

477
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,150
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

478
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,650
And right here... OK, are you ready?

479
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,850
This is where you always slept.

480
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,650
Oh, man!

481
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,950
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

482
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,450
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

483
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,350
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

484
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,350
A little harder than...

485
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,350
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

486
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,350
Is that...?

487
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,950
Is that my...?

488
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,350
Is that me?

489
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,050
You had the cutest little paws.

490
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,650
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

491
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,650
You did that the day we lost you.

492
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,650
Wow. I was so young.

493
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,750
What happened to me?

494
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,250
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

495
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,250
It was not your fault.

496
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,550
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

497
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,250
Far off the reserve.

498
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,550
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

499
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,050
...well...

500
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,650
We thought they'd killed you.

501
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,350
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

502
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,150
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

503
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,550
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

504
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,850
You used to call this "foofie."

505
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,450
"Foofie"?

506
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,650
Foofie.

507
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,250
He doesn't want that.

508
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,950
This is my foofie!

509
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,950
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

510
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,250
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

511
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,950
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

512
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,450
You'll need all your strength.

513
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,950
I will bring the house down for you.

514
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,050
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

515
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,050
Jeez, Mom, really?

516
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,350
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

517
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,250
You were born with it.

518
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,250
Good night, Alakay.

519
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,250
My boy. My own boy.

520
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,650
My son's a king.

521
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,650
My son's a king.

522
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,350
Good night, Mom.

523
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,350
Good night, Alakay.

524
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,450
Foofie.

525
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,350
Look at foofie! My foofie!

526
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,550
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

527
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:58,150
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

528
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,450
I think we're lost.

529
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,350
Nana, do you know where you're going?

530
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,050
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

531
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,450
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

532
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,650
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

533
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,450
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

534
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:23,150
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

535
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,950
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?

536
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,450
How will we all survive?

537
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,450
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

538
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,450
You can let nature
get the best of you,

539
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,950
or you can get the best of nature.

540
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,250
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

541
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,550
Yeah.

542
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,150
We survive the concrete jungle!

543
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,650
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

544
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,350
- Am I right?
- She's right.

545
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,850
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

546
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,450
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

547
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,650
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

548
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,150
If we can make it there,

549
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,750
we can make it anywhere!

550
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,050
I'm coming, King Julien!

551
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,950
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

552
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,950
No, shark, no! Sit!

553
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,150
Why am I laughing?

554
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,050
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

555
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,450
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

556
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,750
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

557
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,550
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

558
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,750
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

559
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,650
Darn you, Darwin!

560
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,650
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

561
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,650
Rico! You're coming with me!

562
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,250
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

563
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,950
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

564
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,350
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

565
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,450
Oh, I doubt that.

566
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,150
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

567
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:46,250
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

568
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,550
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

569
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,050
Any questions?

570
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,850
Good! Let's get to work.

571
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,050
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

572
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,850
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

573
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,450
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

574
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,850
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

575
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,850
Sure, mister.

576
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,950
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

577
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,450
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

578
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,350
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

579
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,650
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

580
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,750
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

581
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,250
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

582
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,350
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

583
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,350
Well, I wish I could help,

584
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,250
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

585
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,050
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

586
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,150
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

587
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,750
Makunga, right? Thank you.

588
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,450
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

589
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,050
Shake it out.

590
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,550
A five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,250
Let's go, let's do this.

592
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,150
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

593
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,550
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

594
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,750
On it, Mom!

595
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,650
Who will be the first participant?

596
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,250
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

597
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,950
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

598
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,950
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

599
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,250
Let me see.

600
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,950
I guess I'll pick...

601
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,050
...Teetsi?

602
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,550
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

603
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,150
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

604
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,850
Somebody, wake him up!

605
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,250
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

606
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:31,850
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

607
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,050
- Let's dance!
- OK.

608
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,950
But let me warn you
that I am a protég?of...

609
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,850
...Fosse and Robbins!

610
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,650
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

611
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,850
Dance fight! You got it.

612
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,450
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

613
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,850
I know that boy is not dancing.

614
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,650
This is even better than I thought.

615
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,050
Alakay, turn around!

616
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,350
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

617
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,750
Oh, no.

618
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,150
Alakay! Are you hurt?

619
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,150
Yeah, I am.

620
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,150
Did I... did I win?

621
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,550
No, son.

622
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,750
How could this happen?

623
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,850
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

624
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,950
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

625
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,450
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

626
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,650
Perform?

627
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,050
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

628
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,350
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

629
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,550
...his own son?

630
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,750
Zuba, no.

631
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,650
Zuba, yes.

632
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,850
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

633
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,950
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

634
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,650
Dad, what are you doing?

635
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,850
Dad, no! You can't do this.

636
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,550
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

637
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,850
Anyone?

638
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,050
Someone? No one?

639
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,450
You, sir!

640
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,150
I guess not.

641
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,150
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

642
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:46,050
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

643
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,050
Teetsi! Get the hat.

644
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,550
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

645
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,850
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

646
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,850
...and leave the watering hole

647
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,750
for a thousand years, or life!

648
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,750
Whichever comes last.

649
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,550
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

650
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,050
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

651
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,750
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

652
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,050
What did you expect?!

653
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,650
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

654
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,550
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

655
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,550
No, I guess not. You dance!

656
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,650
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

657
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,550
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

658
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,350
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

659
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,750
A real lion.

660
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,050
Thanks.

661
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,950
Thanks a lot.

662
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,150
Saw.

663
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,750
Suture.

664
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,950
Swab.

665
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,550
You're in my light, Stephen.

666
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,450
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

667
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,250
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

668
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,950
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

669
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,350
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

670
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,850
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

671
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,450
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

672
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,150
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

673
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,250
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

674
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:39,650
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

675
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,850
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

676
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,550
This won't hurt a bit.

677
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:50,050
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spotjust like that.

678
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,350
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

679
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,350
Wednesday, no Joe?

680
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,950
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

681
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,050
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

682
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,950
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

683
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,150
But I've never heard of it.

684
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,450
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

685
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,950
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

686
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,350
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

687
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,050
Ta-da!!

688
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,950
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

689
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,550
Hollah!

690
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,850
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

691
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,850
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

692
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,650
Well, you can try all you want to,

693
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,750
but it takes years of practice.

694
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,850
You'll never get a tight stream

695
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:52,350
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

696
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,550
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

697
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,550
Ta-da!

698
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,650
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

699
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,550
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

700
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,850
It's in our blood!

701
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,850
I always thought I was a bit unique.

702
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,050
We are unique!

703
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,150
We are like a force of nature!

704
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,050
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

705
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,350
Exactly the same!

706
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,750
Exactly the same.

707
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,750
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

708
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,550
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

709
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,750
Nice.

710
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,250
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

711
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,250
I've ruined my parents' lives.

712
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,450
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

713
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:12,150
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

714
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,650
So...

715
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,150
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

716
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,250
Hey, guys.

717
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,250
Is this place great or what?!

718
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,250
I'd go with "or what."

719
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,950
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

720
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,950
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

721
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,350
Who's Moto Moto?

722
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:36,950
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

723
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,650
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

724
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,650
It means, "Hot Hot."

725
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,950
"Hot Hot"?

726
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,850
When did you start parlez-ing African?

727
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,050
It's in my blood.

728
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,950
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

729
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,950
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

730
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,150
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

731
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,950
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

732
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,350
Whoa, guys.

733
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,050
Main Street's mine!

734
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,350
Well, you can have it!

735
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,550
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

736
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,750
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

737
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:12,350
Melman, just tell her.

738
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,350
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,950
I guess I'll go, then.

740
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,450
Don't bother.

741
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:23,150
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

742
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,550
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

743
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,350
- Marty?
- Marty?

744
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,650
Marty?

745
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,250
What the heck is going on?

746
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,450
You're not...? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

747
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,350
You thought that guy...

748
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,650
...was me?

749
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,450
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

750
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,750
You thought I was him?

751
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,050
You guys kind of do look a little...

752
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,750
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

753
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,750
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

754
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,850
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

755
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:03,150
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

756
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,450
I'm just like any other zebra.

757
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,050
No. Of course you're different!

758
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,750
How?

759
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,550
OK, I can't tell you apart.

760
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,750
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

761
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,450
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

762
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,450
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

763
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,150
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

764
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,750
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

765
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:31,250
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

766
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,950
It's always about you, isn't it?

767
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,550
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

768
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,450
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

769
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,750
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

770
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,150
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

771
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,650
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

772
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,150
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

773
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,050
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

774
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,750
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

775
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,950
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

776
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,050
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

777
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,850
Nice hat, you showoff!

778
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,650
Marty...

779
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,150
...don't go.

780
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:22,850
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

781
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,150
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

782
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,450
Look, Maurice!

783
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,050
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

784
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,150
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

785
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,550
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

786
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,850
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

787
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,450
I'm terminal, you know?

788
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,950
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

789
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,350
That's a bummer, man.

790
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,350
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

791
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,850
...only had two days left to live,

792
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,650
I would do all the things

793
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,150
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

794
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,250
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

795
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,650
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

796
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,650
make my living out of it.

797
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:25,350
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

798
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,350
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

799
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,350
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

800
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,550
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

801
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,650
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

802
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:43,650
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

803
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,750
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

804
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,450
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

805
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,350
What is it? Please tell me!

806
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:55,150
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

807
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,850
How I've always felt about her.

808
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,750
Fine. Don't tell me!

809
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:04,050
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

810
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:08,450
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

811
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,650
Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,750
You're right.

813
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:16,050
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

814
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,450
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

815
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,250
Just a little, or almost all the way.

816
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,550
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

817
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,050
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

818
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,750
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

819
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,350
Actually, it's more like love her.

820
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,250
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

821
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:44,950
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

822
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,850
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

823
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,550
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

824
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,650
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

825
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,250
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

826
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,350
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

827
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,350
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

828
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,250
Do you feel it?

829
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,950
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

830
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:11,250
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

831
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,450
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

832
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,050
I love that happy little head.

833
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,350
She love

834
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,250
Moto Moto

835
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,450
She love

836
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,050
Moto Moto

837
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,650
She loves me
She loves my eyes

838
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,650
She loves me
She loves my thighs

839
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,850
She loves my roundness

840
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:39,050
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

841
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,150
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

842
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:47,350
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

843
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,350
She love me...

844
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,150
...'cause she love me

845
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,650
Moto Moto...

846
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,350
...before things get too serious, well,

847
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:00,650
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

848
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,350
...l'd like to ask you...

849
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:07,050
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

850
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,450
I have so many questions.

851
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,150
I promise the answer will always be yes.

852
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,850
Unless no is required.

853
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:20,250
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

854
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,850
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

855
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,850
OK. Other than that.

856
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,550
Let's see.

857
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,650
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

858
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,950
Right.

859
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,250
My gosh, girl, you huge.

860
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:38,550
You said that.

861
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,750
Yeah, that's right.

862
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,450
We don't have to talk no more.

863
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,850
Gloria!

864
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,150
Gloria.

865
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,550
Melman.

866
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:54,450
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

867
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:59,550
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

868
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,550
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

869
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:05,150
Apology accepted.

870
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,950
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

871
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,450
OK. Well, that's it, then.

872
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,650
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

873
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,450
No. No, that's not it.

874
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,950
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

875
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,750
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

876
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,550
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

877
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,350
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers. OK?

878
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:38,450
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

879
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:40,850
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

880
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,550
No crust, the way she likes it.

881
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:46,150
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

882
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,950
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

883
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:53,650
She has the most amazing laugh.

884
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,950
That's what I would do if I were you.

885
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,650
But I'm not, so you do it.

886
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,650
OK.

887
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,050
What?

888
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:11,550
That was beautiful.

889
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,050
Anyways, where were we?

890
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,850
I'm "huge"?

891
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,350
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

892
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,650
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

893
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:28,050
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

894
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:32,050
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

895
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,650
And making me look like a fool!

896
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,350
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

897
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,050
Coward.

898
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,550
The water. It's gone.

899
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,750
It's never gone dry before.

900
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,650
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

901
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:18,050
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

902
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,950
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

903
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,350
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

904
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,950
Makunga, what do we do?

905
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:26,450
Quiet!

906
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,950
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

907
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,650
We'll all have to fight for it.

908
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,250
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

909
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,250
That's not fair. You'd win!

910
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:41,750
Exactly, Shirley.

911
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:42,950
I'm Bob...

912
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,850
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

913
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,050
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

914
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:53,850
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

915
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,950
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

916
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,550
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

917
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,050
Hunters would shoot us!

918
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,050
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

919
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,950
I left the reserve!

920
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,150
And survived.

921
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,350
I can do something about this.

922
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,750
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

923
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,950
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

924
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,150
You?

925
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:23,250
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

926
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:28,450
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

927
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:34,150
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

928
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,350
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

929
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,550
Zuba would know what to do.

930
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:46,650
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

931
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,950
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

932
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,250
All right, fine!

933
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,950
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

934
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,850
Marty?

935
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,650
Hey! Marty!

936
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,050
Marty?

937
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,450
Marty.

938
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,150
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

939
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,750
Excuse me! Excuse me!

940
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:36,050
Hi. Is Marty in there?

941
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,850
Anyone seen Marty?

942
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,050
Which one of us is Marty?

943
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:46,250
All right. Well, if you see him,

944
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,750
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

945
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,550
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

946
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,950
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

947
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,250
You can't leave the reserve!

948
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,950
What are you doing?

949
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,450
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

950
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,950
Could you leave the hat?

951
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,650
Marty! I know you're in there.

952
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,750
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

953
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,050
You've been a great friend.

954
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:27,550
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

955
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,550
that I never think of you having any.

956
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,450
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

957
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,750
Just like back at the zoo.

958
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,950
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

959
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,450
I just want you to know that I...

960
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,250
You're one in a million.

961
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,650
This is touching.

962
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,150
It is touching.

963
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,950
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

964
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,650
That's right. Gotcha!

965
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:59,550
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

966
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,550
You, right there.

967
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:05,850
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

968
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,350
That's you, Marty.

969
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,450
I know it's you.

970
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,350
Know what makes you special?

971
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:18,150
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

972
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,050
You're a dreamer, Marty.

973
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,950
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

974
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,650
and horrible taste in friends.

975
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:30,150
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

976
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,950
OK, I'm in.

977
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,350
Marty, you can't come with me.

978
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,150
You don't have a choice.

979
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:45,650
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

980
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,650
The people will get you!

981
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,050
Don't lose the hat!

982
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,250
Bye, hat!

983
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:56,950
Any water?

984
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:00,650
No, just more diamonds and gold.

985
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,350
Don't give up hope.

986
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:10,350
Listen up! I will help you!

987
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,550
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

988
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,850
I, your beloved King Julien

989
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:22,050
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

990
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:25,250
in the volcano!

991
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,850
What does that do?

992
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,750
What does that do? Excellent question.

993
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:36,150
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

994
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,250
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

995
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,750
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

996
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,650
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

997
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,150
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

998
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,650
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

999
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:53,750
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

1000
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,350
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1001
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,250
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

1002
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,550
What?

1003
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,150
Does it work?

1004
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,950
No! I mean, yes.

1005
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,950
Well, Maurice?

1006
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,550
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1007
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,450
We'll do it!

1008
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,750
Excellent!

1009
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:23,350
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1010
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,350
and get eaten by gods.

1011
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,650
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1012
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:32,250
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1013
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:37,550
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1014
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,650
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

1015
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:52,750
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1016
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,850
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1017
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:00,850
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1018
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,950
Are you nuts?

1019
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,650
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1020
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,050
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1021
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,450
It was always you.

1022
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,950
Seeing you every day.

1023
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,150
That's what kept me going.

1024
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,850
Melman! Wait!

1025
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:27,550
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1026
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,850
You going to mope like this all day?

1027
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,150
Don't "hmph" me.

1028
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:39,150
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1029
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:44,050
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1030
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,250
What are you saying, woman?

1031
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,350
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1032
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,050
Zuba!

1033
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,650
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1034
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,650
What do you want?

1035
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:07,850
It's awful.

1036
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,250
The watering hole is dried up.

1037
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:13,250
Dried up? That's impossible!

1038
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,250
There's nothing left!

1039
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,050
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1040
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:23,350
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1041
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,050
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1042
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,850
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1043
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,150
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1044
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,350
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1045
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,550
Hurry, Zuba!

1046
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,550
I'm so parched.

1047
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,250
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1048
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:56,850
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1049
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,650
Why are we doing this?

1050
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:02,250
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1051
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,150
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

1052
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:08,350
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1053
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:13,850
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1054
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,150
What?!

1055
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,850
As far as my dad is concerned.

1056
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:20,550
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1057
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,950
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1058
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,050
Marty, this is it!

1059
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,650
This is the clog! Come on.

1060
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,750
Well, there's the water.

1061
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:43,450
Stay down. Look at that.

1062
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,150
Knit one, purl two.

1063
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,350
It's her.

1064
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,050
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1065
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,050
Nana, slow down.

1066
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:53,950
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1067
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,350
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1068
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,750
We need dynamite. Got any?

1069
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:02,950
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1070
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,950
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1071
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,650
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1072
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,450
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1073
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:15,150
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1074
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,550
Etch A Sketch!

1075
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:19,850
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1076
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:25,350
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

1077
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,450
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1078
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,650
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1079
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:36,950
Save us
We love you

1080
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,350
OK.

1081
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:41,350
OK, OK, OK.

1082
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:50,050
- Save us
- Melman

1083
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:51,850
- We love you
- Melman

1084
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:52,950
Save us

1085
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,450
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1086
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,550
- Melman
- We love you

1087
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,150
- Melman
- Save us

1088
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,950
Here we go! Here we go!

1089
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,950
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1090
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:07,750
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1091
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:11,450
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1092
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:14,550
So Melman's not dying!

1093
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,750
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1094
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,050
Melman!

1095
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,650
Move!

1096
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:24,650
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1097
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:29,650
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1098
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,650
Yes!

1099
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,250
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1100
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,350
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1101
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,950
Because...

1102
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,850
You can't do this, Melman.

1103
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:03,750
First, that hurts.

1104
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:07,150
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1105
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,750
Melman, I gotta know...

1106
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,450
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1107
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,850
Of course I did.

1108
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,250
- That's crazy.
- It is?

1109
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:24,950
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1110
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,250
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1111
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,250
lived right next door.

1112
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,650
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1113
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:36,550
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1114
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,950
I'll take whatever you got.

1115
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,550
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1116
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:49,450
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1117
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,450
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1118
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,950
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1119
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:02,550
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1120
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,350
Now, maternity leave.

1121
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,850
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1122
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:10,450
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1123
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:13,450
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1124
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,950
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1125
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:21,350
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1126
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:28,850
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1127
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,650
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1128
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,450
Finally.

1129
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,350
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1130
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:55,050
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1131
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,050
This is wrong.

1132
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,750
You see? You are survivors.

1133
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,550
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1134
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,550
You can't eat a lion.

1135
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:08,550
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1136
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,950
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1137
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,950
She's out of her mind, people!

1138
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,750
I'm from New York City!

1139
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,550
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1140
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,150
Dad!

1141
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:34,250
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1142
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,150
Stay behind me.

1143
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,350
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1144
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,950
Stay back!

1145
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,250
You'd let your dinner get away?

1146
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:54,950
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

1147
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,250
What the heck?

1148
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,650
Hey, I know those moves.

1149
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,150
Alex?

1150
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,850
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1151
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,650
It is Alex!

1152
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:19,350
Only one lion can move like that!

1153
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:26,050
He's beautiful.

1154
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,250
I can't believe it.

1155
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,150
How does he do that?

1156
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,250
What are you doing?

1157
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,250
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1158
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,050
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1159
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:57,750
Butterfly!

1160
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,250
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1161
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,050
Roar!

1162
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,050
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1163
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:30,650
Dad, look out!

1164
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,950
What the...

1165
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,750
Alex! Get in!

1166
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:39,550
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1167
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,450
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1168
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,950
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1169
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:52,050
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1170
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:55,450
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1171
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:58,050
All right! But it's his funeral.

1172
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:01,950
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1173
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,750
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1174
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,450
Come back! That's my dinner!

1175
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,350
Kowalski, full throttle.

1176
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:18,950
Music!

1177
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,550
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1178
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:26,650
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1179
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,950
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1180
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:35,350
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1181
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:39,150
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1182
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:42,350
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1183
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:49,850
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1184
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,350
Are you sure?

1185
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:56,150
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1186
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,850
No! Medic!

1187
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,650
Ramming speed!

1188
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,550
Bring it on!

1189
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:13,650
Bad kitties.

1190
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:24,350
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1191
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:27,050
The science seemed so solid.

1192
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:32,150
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1193
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,850
It's you! I found you!

1194
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,150
Mort?

1195
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,550
Bad fishy!

1196
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:01,450
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1197
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,350
Let's find out.

1198
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,250
Look, Maurice.

1199
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:10,350
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1200
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,250
I did it! I did it!

1201
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,550
OK, you did it!

1202
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,550
Oh, yes!!

1203
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,650
Look!

1204
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,150
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1205
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,650
You did it!

1206
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,150
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1207
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,450
Zuba! Alakay!

1208
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,050
You're back!

1209
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,850
I'm so glad you're safe!

1210
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,450
Out of my way.

1211
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,450
Well, well, well.

1212
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:16,950
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1213
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,150
And you were kicked out.

1214
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:23,150
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1215
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:28,250
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1216
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,750
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

1217
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:33,150
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1218
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:38,450
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1219
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,650
But you're still banished.

1220
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,650
We figured you'd say that.

1221
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,950
My handbag!

1222
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,250
You bad kitty!

1223
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,650
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1224
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,250
You deserve this, son.

1225
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:10,550
Welcome to the pride.

1226
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:18,050
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1227
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:20,850
No, son. To us!

1228
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:30,250
My son! The King of New York!

1229
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,850
That's my baby!

1230
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:44,250
Love transcends all differences.

1231
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:49,250
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1232
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:53,350
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1233
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:58,150
For better, please.

1234
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,050
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1235
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,250
That's not going to last.

1236
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,350
Can I kiss the bride?

1237
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,250
No! Music!

1238
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,050
- Struts.
- Check.

1239
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:12,450
- Flaps!
- Check.

1240
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,450
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1241
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,550
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1242
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:19,850
See you later!

1243
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:22,850
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1244
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,750
or whenever the gold runs out.

1245
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,150
Come back soon!

1246
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:31,350
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1247
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,450
You're right about that!

1248
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,450
As long as I'm with her...

1249
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:39,350
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1250
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,150
She has the most amazing laugh.

1251
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:47,250
Love has no boundaries!

1252
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,550
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1253
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:56,050
Dad? What's wrong?

1254
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,750
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1255
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,350
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1256
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:07,050
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1257
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,650
I got you, son!

1258
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,550
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1259
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:17,050
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1260
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:20,450
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1261
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,650
Ain't no Marty here.

1262
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:27,150
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1263
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,550
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1264
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:33,850
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

1265
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:37,150
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1266
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,150
But now that I'm home

1267
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:42,850
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

1268
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:46,550
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
