1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:29,124
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,306
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,714
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,221
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,660
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,328
Da-da.

7
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

8
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,498
You see this mark?

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,001
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,573
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,408
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:25,180
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,119
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:32,954
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,289
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,261
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,797
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:43,301
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,770
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:51,242
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,438
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,814
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,479
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:05,820
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,223
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

26
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,562
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:16,732
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,400
Two, three!

29
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,358
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,424
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,599
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,061
Alakay?

33
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,934
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,841
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,174
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:08,446
It just gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,718
Daddy!

38
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,782
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,193
Alakay!

40
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,790
Da-da!

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,291
No! No! No!

42
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:27,463
Alakay!

43
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,210
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,649
Da-da!

45
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,332
Alakay!

46
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,848
Daddy!

47
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,766
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

48
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:40,209
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

49
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,271
Take me to a place
where they know my name

50
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,648
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

51
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,813
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

52
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,518
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

53
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:56,720
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:59,889
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

55
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,332
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

56
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,135
Play that jungle fever
Show 'em some love

57
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,231
Show love

58
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,742
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

59
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,404
To relate to, to relate to

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,243
I'm feeling right at home

61
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:19,580
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

62
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,088
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

63
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:26,522
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

64
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,925
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

65
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,190
He's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,596
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,943
Roar!

68
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,611
The King of New York City...

69
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,785
...Alex the Lion!

70
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,017
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,156
The guy's an animal.

72
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:05,219
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

73
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,288
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,899
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:15,163
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

76
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,334
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,641
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,814
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,846
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

80
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,184
to have the animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,588
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

82
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,251
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:39,423
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

84
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:42,092
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:46,126
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

86
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,710
I like to move it, move it

87
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,646
He likes to move it, move it

88
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,650
She likes to move it, move it

89
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,414
- We like to
- Move it!

90
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:39,981
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

91
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,717
- We like to
- Move it!

92
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,252
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

93
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,730
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

94
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,894
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

95
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,566
Seriously though, call. OK?

96
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,672
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

97
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,768
You can't leave without this!

98
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,140
Surprise, freaks!

99
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,907
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:09,813
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

101
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,253
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

102
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:18,495
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

103
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,594
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

104
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,263
Oh, no, thank you.

105
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:32,609
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

106
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,609
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

107
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,783
...Stevie will be in charge!

108
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,619
I don't think they like that idea.

109
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,951
What are you saying, Stevie?

110
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,888
No.

111
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:57,402
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

112
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:01,337
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

113
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,407
Let them eat cake!

114
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:06,410
King Julien, wait for me!

115
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:09,743
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

116
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,811
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

117
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,053
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

118
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,146
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

119
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,153
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

120
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,695
- Struts.
- Check.

121
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,854
- Flaps.
- Check.

122
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,523
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

123
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,663
You guys!

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,169
Oopsie-daisy!

125
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,176
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

126
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,674
But it'll have to do. Attention.

127
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,349
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:48,576
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

129
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,515
then kiss your... good-bye.

130
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,788
New York City, here we come!

131
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,588
Pray to your personal God
this hunk of junk flies.

132
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,795
Personal God, hunk...? What?

133
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:00,187
We are go, sir.

134
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,366
Open the door! I'm outside!

135
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,363
If cabin pressure is lost,

136
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:09,131
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

137
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:13,367
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,877
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

139
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,513
Launch!

140
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,710
- Launch!
- Launch!

141
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,086
Gremlin!

142
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:06,928
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,192
Hi!

144
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,327
That was weird.

145
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,667
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

146
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,774
You got Madagascar on the brain.

147
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,377
I know I'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:25,815
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,545
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:32,056
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,890
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,790
Are the butts next to the croutons?

153
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,062
You don't need to be sarcastic.

154
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:46,571
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

155
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:47,696
Breeding program?

156
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,901
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

157
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,410
Settle down, have a relationship.

158
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,604
I can see that.

159
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,945
What? Like dating?

160
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:59,574
Yeah, dating.

161
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,176
Other... other guys?

162
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:05,483
What do you mean, other guys?

163
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,325
Darn it!

164
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,488
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

165
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,664
I'm gonna go check.

166
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,195
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

167
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,172
It's so funny!

168
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,210
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

169
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,507
To laugh!

170
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,342
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

171
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,221
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

172
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,658
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

173
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,458
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

174
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,226
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

175
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,427
We were checking on our drink order.

176
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,693
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

177
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,336
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

178
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,911
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

179
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:03,174
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

180
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,048
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

181
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,552
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

182
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,120
Skipper, look.

183
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:13,918
Analysis.

184
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:18,156
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

185
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,425
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

186
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,488
That too, sir.

187
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,897
Right! Rico?

188
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,124
Manual!

189
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,997
Problemo solved.

190
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,405
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

191
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,142
We've lost engine one...

192
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,906
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

193
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,740
Buckle up, boys.

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,343
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

195
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:42,917
Attention! This is your captain.

196
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,682
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

197
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,917
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

198
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,863
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

199
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,925
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

200
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,782
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

201
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,453
I can fly!

202
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:23,387
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

203
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,522
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

204
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:30,165
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

205
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,032
I broke your iPod!

206
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:34,799
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

207
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,137
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

208
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,070
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

209
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,869
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

210
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,979
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

211
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:56,150
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

212
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,830
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

213
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,836
Rico, you've had your fun.

214
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,168
Pull up.

215
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,769
Gear down.

216
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,915
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

217
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,848
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

218
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:26,980
I said, kiss it!

219
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,132
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

220
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,867
I believe that's checkmate.

221
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:48,535
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

222
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,594
Oh, we're here.

223
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,426
What in the world?

224
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,205
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

225
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,706
I'm OK. I'm alive.

226
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,802
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

227
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,904
Kowalski, casualty report.

228
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,948
Two passengers unaccounted for.

229
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,946
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

230
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:30,619
Who says a penguin can't fly?

231
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:35,686
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

232
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,395
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

233
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:41,296
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

234
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,330
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

235
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:48,338
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

236
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:51,136
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

237
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:55,472
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

238
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,238
How do you estimate that?

239
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,883
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

240
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,114
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

241
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:08,592
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

242
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,026
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

243
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,155
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

244
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,093
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

245
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,828
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

246
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:20,735
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

247
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,673
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

248
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,076
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

249
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:30,171
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

250
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:34,178
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

251
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,955
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

252
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,015
You know, grit and spit and spit.

253
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,959
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

254
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,293
That don't sound too promising.

255
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,889
You're right. We're stuck here.

256
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,960
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

257
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,303
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

258
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:58,706
Behold! The lion!

259
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,404
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

260
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,880
Wait, wait, wait! People!

261
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,715
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

262
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,544
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

263
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,218
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

264
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,823
I know you!

265
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:17,953
You.

266
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:20,054
It's the bad kitty.

267
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:30,065
How do you like some of that?!

268
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:51,255
Come in, Tokyo!

269
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,434
Right in the batteries.

270
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:02,366
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

271
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,709
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

272
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,172
Thank you, dear.

273
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:09,777
Moving on!

274
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,284
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

275
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,512
Out of my mind?

276
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,448
Who's out of my mind now?

277
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,892
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

278
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,295
Out of my mind. We're going home.

279
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,970
Message E-4.

280
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:43,874
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

281
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,481
Please try again later.

282
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,487
Am I trippin'?

283
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,991
All those zebras... like me.

284
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,657
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

285
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,330
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

286
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,999
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

287
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,225
Africa?

288
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,835
It's got to be.

289
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,664
Our ancestral crib.

290
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,104
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

291
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,835
No, it's more than that. It's like...

292
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,014
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

293
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,842
It's like Roots!

294
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,586
No, it's like...

295
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,017
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

296
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,356
How!

297
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,527
How!

298
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,028
Me Alex!

299
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,532
Me and me friends fly,

300
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,865
fly in great metal bird.

301
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:48,538
Then plummet!

302
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:50,878
Smash ground!

303
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,379
Go boom!

304
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,711
Then here we emerge.

305
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,082
We offer only happiness

306
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,820
and good greetings.

307
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,223
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

308
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,729
Yeah. We just... yeah.

309
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,728
I thought... Sorry.

310
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,963
You came from off the reserve?

311
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,071
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

312
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,405
Don't strain yourself.

313
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,845
What's going on here?

314
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,683
They say they're from off the reserve.

315
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:34,122
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

316
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,353
You look familiar. Do I know you?

317
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:38,952
How could you survive the hunters?

318
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,362
We didn't see any hunters.

319
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,297
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

320
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,531
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

321
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:49,103
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

322
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,535
Is there a manager we could talk to?

323
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:54,677
I see. You're here to challenge me!

324
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,436
What? No! No.

325
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,342
That's what it looks like to me!

326
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:59,947
Zuba! Wait.

327
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,947
I'm trying to take care of business...

328
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,682
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

329
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,687
Alakay?

330
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,789
Is that you?

331
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,360
No, it's Alex. Ix. Like New York Knicks.

332
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,723
Zuba, look!

333
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,791
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

334
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,127
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

335
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,899
A mark.

336
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:25,469
All right, this is a little weird.

337
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,638
Honey, he's come home.

338
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,674
What?

339
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,646
You've come home.

340
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,050
Son.

341
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,322
Dad.

342
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:54,437
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

343
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,838
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

344
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,404
I got a mom and dad!

345
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:02,009
My baby's alive!

346
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,611
Dad!

347
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,509
My son!

348
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,846
My son is home!

349
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:13,849
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

350
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:22,359
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

351
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,860
I thought you hated Zuba.

352
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,636
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

353
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:32,232
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

354
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,871
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

355
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,706
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

356
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,649
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

357
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,379
New York!

358
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,656
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

359
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,989
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

360
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,325
This calls for a celebration!

361
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,262
Maurice, I think they like me.

362
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,892
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

363
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,226
Chukka-chukka what?

364
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:10,807
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

365
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,343
Hey, Marty!

366
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,820
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

367
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,592
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

368
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,361
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

369
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,456
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

370
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,967
What? You don't have doctors here?

371
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,525
Not anymore.

372
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:35,094
Well, what if you catch a cold?

373
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,267
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

374
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:43,009
You guys really need a doctor.

375
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,278
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

376
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,841
Me? A doctor?

377
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,122
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

378
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,221
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

379
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:02,822
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

380
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,995
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

381
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,198
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

382
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:13,209
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

383
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,011
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

384
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:20,744
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

385
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,677
Roar!

386
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:26,814
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

387
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:31,760
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

388
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,264
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

389
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,702
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

390
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:44,104
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!

391
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,241
How do I look?

392
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:52,506
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

393
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:55,183
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

394
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:57,916
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

395
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,588
My mother will be so happy.

396
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:08,592
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

397
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:12,366
Here he comes.

398
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:16,937
I like 'em big

399
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,375
I like 'em chunky

400
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,544
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

401
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:27,311
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

402
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,616
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

403
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,054
Goodness, girl... you huge.

404
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,384
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

405
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,818
You as quick as you are hefty.

406
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,463
So you're Moto Moto?

407
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,727
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

408
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,629
I kind of like it, fatso.

409
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:49,901
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

410
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,306
Oops!

411
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,650
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

412
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,186
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

413
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,690
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

414
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:13,389
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

415
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,557
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

416
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:21,037
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

417
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,403
I forgot about the rite of passage.

418
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,738
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

419
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,335
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

420
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:32,140
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

421
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:35,947
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

422
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,148
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

423
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:43,057
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

424
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,890
I want to be Alaki.

425
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:47,294
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

426
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,959
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

427
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:52,730
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

428
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:55,067
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

429
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:57,300
That's my boy!

430
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,512
I'm a private dancer

431
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,052
A dancer for money

432
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,985
Any old music will do

433
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,663
Beautiful, isn't it?

434
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,725
It's amazing.

435
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:27,935
Guys...

436
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,664
...this is where we belong.

437
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,742
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

438
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:36,877
Oh, I like that one.

439
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:38,676
It works on many levels.

440
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,546
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

441
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,108
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

442
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:44,017
Stations.

443
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,079
Stage one. Go!

444
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,629
Oh, no! What have I done?

445
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,204
Come on, take the bait.

446
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,903
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

447
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:08,535
Is it dead?

448
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,773
Stage two! Go, go, go!

449
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:21,985
I will give him the kiss of life.

450
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,650
Rico!

451
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:29,694
Rico!

452
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,267
Reverse!

453
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:34,326
Gas!

454
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,667
Music!

455
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,066
No! Stop! Stop!

456
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,009
Stop!

457
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:43,577
Come back!

458
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,345
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

459
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:55,689
Is she dead?

460
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,483
No!

461
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,503
You hoodlums!

462
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,372
Good heavens! Are you OK?

463
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,639
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

464
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:18,443
My handbag. Such a good boy.

465
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,711
Nana can't survive without it.

466
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,942
You are one tough cookie.

467
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:26,020
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

468
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,890
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

469
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,555
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...

470
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,723
Where are you going?

471
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:40,195
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

472
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,066
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

473
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,876
Please! We need to stay...

474
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:49,743
...together.

475
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:52,872
Fine! We'll go that way!

476
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,549
Does anyone want a hard candy?

477
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,752
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

478
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:06,226
And right here... OK, are you ready?

479
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:10,496
This is where you always slept.

480
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,229
Oh, man!

481
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:19,564
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

482
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:23,006
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

483
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,913
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

484
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:27,906
A little harder than...

485
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:31,916
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

486
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,916
Is that...?

487
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,589
Is that my...?

488
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,926
Is that me?

489
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:41,693
You had the cutest little paws.

490
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,264
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

491
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,264
You did that the day we lost you.

492
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,268
Wow. I was so young.

493
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,307
What happened to me?

494
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:57,805
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

495
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,873
It was not your fault.

496
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,144
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

497
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:06,820
Far off the reserve.

498
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:10,151
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

499
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,617
...well...

500
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:15,295
We thought they'd killed you.

501
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,967
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

502
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:21,727
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

503
00:32:21,972 --> 00:32:26,170
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

504
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,443
You used to call this "foofie."

505
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:32,004
"Foofie"?

506
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,249
Foofie.

507
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,842
He doesn't want that.

508
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,512
This is my foofie!

509
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,516
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

510
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:46,859
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

511
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:50,530
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

512
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,029
You'll need all your strength.

513
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,537
I will bring the house down for you.

514
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:59,601
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

515
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,677
Jeez, Mom, really?

516
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,938
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

517
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,882
You were born with it.

518
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,878
Good night, Alakay.

519
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:14,884
My boy. My own boy.

520
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:19,226
My son's a king.

521
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:22,229
My son's a king.

522
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:33,900
Good night, Mom.

523
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,903
Good night, Alakay.

524
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:45,054
Foofie.

525
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,921
Look at foofie! My foofie!

526
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:52,154
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

527
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,731
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

528
00:33:58,068 --> 00:34:00,059
I think we're lost.

529
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:02,931
Nana, do you know where you're going?

530
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:07,671
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

531
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,077
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

532
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,283
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

533
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:18,014
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

534
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:22,752
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

535
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:25,590
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?

536
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,028
How will we all survive?

537
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:31,090
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

538
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:36,038
You can let nature
get the best of you,

539
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:38,540
or you can get the best of nature.

540
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,845
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

541
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,177
Yeah.

542
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,708
We survive the concrete jungle!

543
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,223
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

544
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,951
- Am I right?
- She's right.

545
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:58,461
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

546
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:03,022
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

547
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,262
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

548
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:07,735
If we can make it there,

549
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,330
we can make it anywhere!

550
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:28,684
I'm coming, King Julien!

551
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,531
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

552
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,535
No, shark, no! Sit!

553
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:45,705
Why am I laughing?

554
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:53,648
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

555
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:56,083
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

556
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,384
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

557
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:02,189
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

558
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:04,318
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

559
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:06,225
Darn you, Darwin!

560
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:11,233
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

561
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:14,234
Rico! You're coming with me!

562
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:18,898
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

563
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,571
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

564
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,917
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

565
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,086
Oh, I doubt that.

566
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:41,757
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

567
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,867
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

568
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:50,167
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

569
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,605
Any questions?

570
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,433
Good! Let's get to work.

571
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:04,618
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

572
00:37:04,955 --> 00:37:08,447
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

573
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:19,034
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

574
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,461
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

575
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,400
Sure, mister.

576
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:29,502
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

577
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,072
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

578
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,916
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

579
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:40,252
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

580
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,383
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

581
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,820
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

582
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,996
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

583
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,994
Well, I wish I could help,

584
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,830
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

585
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,600
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

586
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,780
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

587
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:05,337
Makunga, right? Thank you.

588
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,084
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

589
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,683
Shake it out.

590
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,185
A five, six, seven, eight.

591
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:14,854
Let's go, let's do this.

592
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,701
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

593
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:39,112
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

594
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:40,376
On it, Mom!

595
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,213
Who will be the first participant?

596
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,880
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

597
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,554
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

598
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,554
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

599
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,888
Let me see.

600
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:55,554
I guess I'll pick...

601
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,658
...Teetsi?

602
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,140
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

603
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,741
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

604
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:10,409
Somebody, wake him up!

605
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,860
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

606
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,424
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

607
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,670
- Let's dance!
- OK.

608
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:36,501
But let me warn you
that I am a protégé of...

609
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:39,435
...Fosse and Robbins!

610
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,267
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

611
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:45,445
Dance fight! You got it.

612
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,054
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

613
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,456
I know that boy is not dancing.

614
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:59,288
This is even better than I thought.

615
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:03,622
Alakay, turn around!

616
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:08,065
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

617
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,475
Oh, no.

618
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,811
Alakay! Are you hurt?

619
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:24,814
Yeah, I am.

620
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,885
Did I... did I win?

621
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,288
No, son.

622
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,417
How could this happen?

623
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:34,555
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

624
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:38,658
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

625
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:43,128
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

626
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:44,366
Perform?

627
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:48,775
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

628
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:54,010
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

629
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:56,276
...his own son?

630
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,412
Zuba, no.

631
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,387
Zuba, yes.

632
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,524
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

633
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:19,607
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

634
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,371
Dad, what are you doing?

635
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,545
Dad, no! You can't do this.

636
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,286
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

637
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,548
Anyone?

638
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,720
Someone? No one?

639
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,149
You, sir!

640
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:38,819
I guess not.

641
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,887
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

642
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:45,724
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

643
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,736
Teetsi! Get the hat.

644
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,242
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

645
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,570
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

646
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,578
...and leave the watering hole

647
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,408
for a thousand years, or life!

648
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:06,415
Whichever comes last.

649
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,261
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

650
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:16,760
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

651
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,400
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

652
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:20,766
What did you expect?!

653
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:25,399
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

654
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:28,273
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

655
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,245
No, I guess not. You dance!

656
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:34,374
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

657
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,215
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

658
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:39,016
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

659
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,451
A real lion.

660
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,791
Thanks.

661
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:49,621
Thanks a lot.

662
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:00,804
Saw.

663
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,476
Suture.

664
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:06,646
Swab.

665
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,248
You're in my light, Stephen.

666
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,147
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

667
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,916
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

668
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,651
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

669
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,057
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

670
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:24,597
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

671
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,102
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

672
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,833
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

673
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:33,941
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

674
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:39,346
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

675
00:43:40,183 --> 00:43:42,515
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

676
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:45,276
This won't hurt a bit.

677
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,788
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spot just like that.

678
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:54,023
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

679
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,095
Wednesday, no Joe?

680
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:58,631
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

681
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:02,770
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

682
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:06,633
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

683
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,803
But I've never heard of it.

684
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:12,143
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

685
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:14,649
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

686
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,051
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

687
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:29,754
Ta-da!

688
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:32,660
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

689
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,260
Hollah!

690
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:38,501
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

691
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,566
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

692
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,310
Well, you can try all you want to,

693
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,405
but it takes years of practice.

694
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,507
You'll never get a tight stream

695
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:52,044
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

696
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,283
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

697
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:09,264
Ta-da!

698
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:16,340
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

699
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,210
- If you can do it...
- ...we can do it.

700
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:19,509
It's in our blood!

701
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,513
I always thought I was a bit unique.

702
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:23,779
We are unique!

703
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,851
We are like a force of nature!

704
00:45:26,122 --> 00:45:28,784
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

705
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:31,053
Exactly the same!

706
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:34,452
Exactly the same.

707
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:39,460
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

708
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:43,295
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

709
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:46,464
Nice.

710
00:45:58,988 --> 00:46:02,981
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

711
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:04,989
I've ruined my parents' lives.

712
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:07,162
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

713
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,894
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

714
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,328
So...

715
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:17,829
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

716
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:18,996
Hey, guys.

717
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:21,909
Is this place great or what?!

718
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:23,940
I'd go with "or what."

719
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:27,676
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

720
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,675
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

721
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:33,011
Who's Moto Moto?

722
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:36,684
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

723
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:39,358
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

724
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,359
It means, "Hot Hot."

725
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:42,656
"Hot Hot"?

726
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,528
When did you start parlez-ing African?

727
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:46,791
It's in my blood.

728
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:50,665
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

729
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,607
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

730
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:55,837
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

731
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:58,608
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

732
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,080
Whoa, guys.

733
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:01,773
Main Street's mine!

734
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:04,012
Well, you can have it!

735
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:08,217
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

736
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:10,482
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

737
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,058
Melman, just tell her.

738
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:16,058
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,698
I guess I'll go, then.

740
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,166
Don't bother.

741
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:22,830
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

742
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:27,240
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

743
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,073
- Marty?
- Marty?

744
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,303
Marty?

745
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:32,908
What the heck is going on?

746
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:38,177
You're not...? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

747
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:41,018
You thought that guy...

748
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,352
...was me?

749
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:45,189
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

750
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:47,422
You thought I was him?

751
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,755
You guys kind of do look a little...

752
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,495
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

753
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:56,437
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

754
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,566
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

755
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,804
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

756
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:05,105
I'm just like any other zebra.

757
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:06,773
No. Of course you're different!

758
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:08,447
How?

759
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:12,280
OK, I can't tell you apart.

760
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:15,420
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

761
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,120
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

762
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:21,123
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

763
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:23,889
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

764
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:27,466
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

765
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,969
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

766
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:34,640
It's always about you, isn't it?

767
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,243
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

768
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:41,147
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

769
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,480
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

770
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,815
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

771
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:51,322
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

772
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,861
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

773
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,766
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

774
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:03,464
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

775
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:06,669
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

776
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:09,769
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

777
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,508
Nice hat, you showoff!

778
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,352
Marty...

779
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:21,846
...don't go.

780
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:22,559
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

781
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:23,856
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

782
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,194
Look, Maurice!

783
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,763
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

784
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,868
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

785
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,203
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

786
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:42,534
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

787
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,109
I'm terminal, you know?

788
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:49,642
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

789
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,047
That's a bummer, man.

790
00:49:52,388 --> 00:49:55,050
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

791
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,552
...only had two days left to live,

792
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,327
I would do all the things

793
00:49:59,395 --> 00:50:01,886
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

794
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,991
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

795
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:09,334
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

796
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:11,396
make my living out of it.

797
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:25,016
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

798
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:29,024
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

799
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,026
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

800
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,253
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

801
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:39,366
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

802
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:43,371
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

803
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:46,431
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

804
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:49,103
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

805
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:51,043
What is it? Please tell me!

806
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,880
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

807
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,543
How I've always felt about her.

808
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:58,450
Fine. Don't tell me!

809
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:03,718
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

810
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:08,127
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

811
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:10,398
Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:12,400
You're right.

813
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:15,733
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

814
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:19,138
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

815
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:21,966
Just a little, or almost all the way.

816
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:26,247
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

817
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:29,751
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

818
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:33,482
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

819
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:38,055
Actually, it's more like love her.

820
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:40,994
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

821
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:44,663
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

822
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,563
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

823
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:49,236
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

824
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,340
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

825
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,901
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

826
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,010
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

827
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:01,011
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

828
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:02,907
Do you feel it?

829
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:05,684
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

830
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:10,925
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

831
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:14,186
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

832
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,794
I love that happy little head.

833
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,025
She love

834
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:20,929
Moto Moto

835
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,128
She love

836
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:24,703
Moto Moto

837
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,377
She loves me
She loves my eyes

838
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:32,378
She loves me
She loves my thighs

839
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:34,546
She loves my roundness

840
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:38,718
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

841
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:42,889
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

842
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:47,060
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

843
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:49,091
She love me...

844
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,824
...'cause she love me

845
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,398
Moto Moto...

846
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:56,065
...before things get too serious, well,

847
00:52:56,405 --> 00:53:00,398
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

848
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:02,074
...I'd like to ask you...

849
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:06,745
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

850
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:09,181
I have so many questions.

851
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:12,854
I promise the answer will always be yes.

852
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:15,584
Unless no is required.

853
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:19,924
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

854
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:23,530
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

855
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,533
OK. Other than that.

856
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,262
Let's see.

857
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:30,328
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

858
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:32,605
Right.

859
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,942
My gosh, girl, you huge.

860
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,202
You said that.

861
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:40,438
Yeah, that's right.

862
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,115
We don't have to talk no more.

863
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:44,546
Gloria!

864
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:46,880
Gloria.

865
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,283
Melman.

866
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:54,126
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

867
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,295
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

868
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:03,264
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

869
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:04,863
Apology accepted.

870
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:09,640
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

871
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:13,114
OK. Well, that's it, then.

872
00:54:13,182 --> 00:54:16,310
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

873
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:19,143
No. No, that's not it.

874
00:54:20,656 --> 00:54:23,648
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

875
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,493
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

876
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,255
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

877
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:34,099
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. OK?

878
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,106
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

879
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,540
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

880
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,271
No crust, the way she likes it.

881
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:45,844
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

882
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:49,609
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

883
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:53,348
She has the most amazing laugh.

884
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:59,684
That's what I would do if I were you.

885
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:02,361
But I'm not, so you do it.

886
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:05,360
OK.

887
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,700
What?

888
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,204
That was beautiful.

889
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:14,707
Anyways, where were we?

890
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,542
I'm "huge"?

891
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,008
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

892
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:23,313
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

893
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:27,720
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

894
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,783
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

895
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,329
And making me look like a fool!

896
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,076
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

897
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,748
Coward.

898
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:09,261
The water. It's gone.

899
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:11,429
It's never gone dry before.

900
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,367
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

901
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:17,702
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

902
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:20,640
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

903
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,042
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

904
00:56:23,112 --> 00:56:24,602
Makunga, what do we do?

905
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,170
Quiet!

906
00:56:26,615 --> 00:56:31,609
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

907
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,350
We'll all have to fight for it.

908
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:36,948
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

909
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,951
That's not fair. You'd win!

910
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:41,460
Exactly, Shirley.

911
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,619
I'm Bob...

912
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,532
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

913
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:49,794
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

914
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:53,599
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

915
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:57,635
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

916
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,244
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

917
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:01,782
Hunters would shoot us!

918
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:03,751
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

919
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:05,650
I left the reserve!

920
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:07,816
And survived.

921
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,092
I can do something about this.

922
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,494
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

923
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:17,691
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

924
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,893
You?

925
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:22,963
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

926
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,170
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

927
00:57:29,178 --> 00:57:33,842
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

928
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,010
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

929
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,256
Zuba would know what to do.

930
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,358
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

931
00:57:46,595 --> 00:57:48,688
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

932
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,927
All right, fine!

933
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:58,696
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

934
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:06,545
Marty?

935
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,389
Hey! Marty!

936
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:23,721
Marty?

937
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,161
Marty.

938
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,896
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

939
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:32,400
Excuse me! Excuse me!

940
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:35,733
Hi. Is Marty in there?

941
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,573
Anyone seen Marty?

942
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,750
Which one of us is Marty?

943
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:45,914
All right. Well, if you see him,

944
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:48,422
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

945
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,255
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

946
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,694
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

947
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:56,924
You can't leave the reserve!

948
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:09,675
What are you doing?

949
00:59:09,945 --> 00:59:12,106
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

950
00:59:13,115 --> 00:59:14,605
Could you leave the hat?

951
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:16,344
Marty! I know you're in there.

952
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,445
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

953
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,721
You've been a great friend.

954
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:27,284
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

955
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,228
that I never think of you having any.

956
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,124
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

957
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,467
Just like back at the zoo.

958
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:40,638
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

959
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,138
I just want you to know that I...

960
00:59:44,146 --> 00:59:45,977
You're one in a million.

961
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,313
This is touching.

962
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,817
It is touching.

963
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:53,644
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

964
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:56,314
That's right. Gotcha!

965
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,253
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

966
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:01,262
You, right there.

967
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:05,596
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

968
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,067
That's you, Marty.

969
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,164
I know it's you.

970
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:13,065
Know what makes you special?

971
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:17,846
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

972
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,741
You're a dreamer, Marty.

973
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:23,678
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

974
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:26,351
and horrible taste in friends.

975
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,852
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

976
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,627
OK, I'm in.

977
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,028
Marty, you can't come with me.

978
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,861
You don't have a choice.

979
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,367
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

980
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,369
The people will get you!

981
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,769
Don't lose the hat!

982
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,977
Bye, hat!

983
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,643
Any water?

984
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:00,386
No, just more diamonds and gold.

985
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,060
Don't give up hope.

986
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:10,030
Listen up! I will help you!

987
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,227
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

988
01:01:13,802 --> 01:01:16,566
I, your beloved King Julien

989
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:21,736
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

990
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:24,910
in the volcano!

991
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:29,577
What does that do?

992
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:32,480
What does that do? Excellent question.

993
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,849
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

994
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:39,917
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

995
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:42,423
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

996
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,365
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

997
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:47,800
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

998
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,304
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

999
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:53,432
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

1000
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:59,038
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

1001
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:02,982
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

1002
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:04,280
What?

1003
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,846
Does it work?

1004
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:08,620
No! I mean, yes.

1005
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:10,614
Well, Maurice?

1006
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:13,291
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

1007
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:16,127
We'll do it!

1008
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:18,463
Excellent!

1009
01:02:19,134 --> 01:02:23,002
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1010
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,063
and get eaten by gods.

1011
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,368
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

1012
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,971
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1013
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:37,217
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

1014
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,311
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

1015
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,494
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

1016
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,560
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1017
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:00,502
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1018
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,606
Are you nuts?

1019
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,374
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1020
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:08,780
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

1021
01:03:09,017 --> 01:03:11,110
It was always you.

1022
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:13,620
Seeing you every day.

1023
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,850
That's what kept me going.

1024
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:21,519
Melman! Wait!

1025
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:27,262
Melman! Melman! Melman!

1026
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:32,529
You going to mope like this all day?

1027
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,865
Don't "hmph" me.

1028
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,807
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

1029
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:43,750
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1030
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:45,946
What are you saying, woman?

1031
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:51,053
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

1032
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:01,733
Zuba!

1033
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:04,399
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

1034
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,301
What do you want?

1035
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,569
It's awful.

1036
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:09,972
The watering hole is dried up.

1037
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:12,980
Dried up? That's impossible!

1038
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:14,913
There's nothing left!

1039
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:18,749
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1040
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:23,053
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1041
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,717
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1042
01:04:24,793 --> 01:04:27,523
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1043
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:29,860
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1044
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:34,000
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1045
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:38,266
Hurry, Zuba!

1046
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:43,204
I'm so parched.

1047
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,947
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1048
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,548
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1049
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,354
Why are we doing this?

1050
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:01,960
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1051
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:04,830
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

1052
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,063
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1053
01:05:08,136 --> 01:05:13,574
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1054
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:14,802
What?!

1055
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,576
As far as my dad is concerned.

1056
01:05:17,646 --> 01:05:20,240
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1057
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:23,645
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1058
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,710
Marty, this is it!

1059
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,313
This is the clog! Come on.

1060
01:05:36,331 --> 01:05:38,492
Well, there's the water.

1061
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:43,160
Stay down. Look at that.

1062
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:45,837
Knit one, purl two.

1063
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,000
It's her.

1064
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:48,770
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1065
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,778
Nana, slow down.

1066
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,610
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1067
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:56,014
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1068
01:05:56,952 --> 01:05:58,419
We need dynamite. Got any?

1069
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:02,680
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1070
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,689
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1071
01:06:06,962 --> 01:06:09,328
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1072
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:12,196
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1073
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:14,866
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1074
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:16,295
Etch A Sketch!

1075
01:06:16,538 --> 01:06:19,530
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1076
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:25,043
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

1077
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,114
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1078
01:06:29,384 --> 01:06:32,319
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1079
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,649
Save us
We love you

1080
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:38,056
OK.

1081
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:41,055
OK, OK, OK.

1082
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:49,766
- Save us
- Melman

1083
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:51,567
- We love you
- Melman

1084
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,629
Save us

1085
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,142
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1086
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,201
- Melman
- We love you

1087
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,837
- Melman
- Save us

1088
01:06:58,947 --> 01:07:01,609
Here we go! Here we go!

1089
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,683
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1090
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,411
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1091
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:11,147
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1092
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:14,259
So Melman's not dying!

1093
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:17,425
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1094
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:18,755
Melman!

1095
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,365
Move!

1096
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:24,368
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1097
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:29,308
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1098
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,367
Yes!

1099
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:36,907
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1100
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:39,044
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1101
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:40,618
Because...

1102
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,536
You can't do this, Melman.

1103
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,471
First, that hurts.

1104
01:08:03,745 --> 01:08:06,873
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1105
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:09,473
Melman, I gotta know...

1106
01:08:10,652 --> 01:08:13,143
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1107
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:15,555
Of course I did.

1108
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,984
- That's crazy.
- It is?

1109
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:24,655
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1110
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:27,997
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1111
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:29,997
lived right next door.

1112
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,338
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1113
01:08:33,575 --> 01:08:36,237
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1114
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:38,672
I'll take whatever you got.

1115
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:46,283
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1116
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:49,187
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1117
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:53,189
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1118
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,692
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1119
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,267
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1120
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:04,032
Now, maternity leave.

1121
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:07,598
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1122
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:10,167
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1123
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:13,180
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1124
01:09:13,248 --> 01:09:16,615
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1125
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:21,019
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1126
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:28,586
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1127
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,368
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1128
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,108
Finally.

1129
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:51,048
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1130
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,782
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1131
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:56,784
This is wrong.

1132
01:09:56,858 --> 01:10:00,419
You see? You are survivors.

1133
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:04,295
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1134
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,257
You can't eat a lion.

1135
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:08,268
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1136
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:10,634
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1137
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,634
She's out of her mind, people!

1138
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:17,472
I'm from New York City!

1139
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:20,214
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1140
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:28,812
Dad!

1141
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:33,990
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1142
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:37,828
Stay behind me.

1143
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:41,096
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1144
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:42,667
Stay back!

1145
01:10:43,004 --> 01:10:44,995
You'd let your dinner get away?

1146
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:54,679
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

1147
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,909
What the heck?

1148
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:07,358
Hey, I know those moves.

1149
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:08,854
Alex?

1150
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:14,597
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1151
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:16,301
It is Alex!

1152
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:19,033
Only one lion can move like that!

1153
01:11:24,379 --> 01:11:25,710
He's beautiful.

1154
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:26,936
I can't believe it.

1155
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,883
How does he do that?

1156
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:49,962
What are you doing?

1157
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:52,900
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1158
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:54,731
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1159
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,405
Butterfly!

1160
01:12:00,081 --> 01:12:01,912
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1161
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,753
Roar!

1162
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:28,766
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1163
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,338
Dad, look out!

1164
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:33,607
What the...

1165
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,440
Alex! Get in!

1166
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,279
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1167
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,146
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1168
01:12:41,289 --> 01:12:43,621
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1169
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:51,789
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1170
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:55,127
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1171
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,702
All right! But it's his funeral.

1172
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,640
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1173
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:04,468
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1174
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,151
Come back! That's my dinner!

1175
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:15,049
Kowalski, full throttle.

1176
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:18,648
Music!

1177
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,253
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1178
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:26,399
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1179
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:30,660
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1180
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,003
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1181
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:38,839
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1182
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,072
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1183
01:13:45,286 --> 01:13:49,518
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1184
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,089
Are you sure?

1185
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,853
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1186
01:13:56,197 --> 01:13:57,528
No! Medic!

1187
01:14:02,203 --> 01:14:03,363
Ramming speed!

1188
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:09,201
Bring it on!

1189
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:13,377
Bad kitties.

1190
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:24,048
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1191
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:26,724
The science seemed so solid.

1192
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:31,895
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1193
01:14:41,576 --> 01:14:43,567
It's you! I found you!

1194
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:44,801
Mort?

1195
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:49,243
Bad fishy!

1196
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,160
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1197
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:03,088
Let's find out.

1198
01:15:04,599 --> 01:15:05,930
Look, Maurice.

1199
01:15:08,369 --> 01:15:10,098
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1200
01:15:10,438 --> 01:15:12,929
I did it! I did it!

1201
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:15,264
OK, you did it!

1202
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,273
Oh, yes!

1203
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:44,393
Look!

1204
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,804
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1205
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:49,307
You did it!

1206
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,802
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1207
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,144
Zuba! Alakay!

1208
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:01,744
You're back!

1209
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:05,549
I'm so glad you're safe!

1210
01:16:06,494 --> 01:16:08,155
Out of my way.

1211
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:11,162
Well, well, well.

1212
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:16,661
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1213
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,836
And you were kicked out.

1214
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,838
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1215
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:27,912
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1216
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,447
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

1217
01:16:30,518 --> 01:16:32,884
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1218
01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:38,119
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1219
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:40,350
But you're still banished.

1220
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:42,358
We figured you'd say that.

1221
01:16:44,532 --> 01:16:46,693
My handbag!

1222
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:48,935
You bad kitty!

1223
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,398
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1224
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,944
You deserve this, son.

1225
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,217
Welcome to the pride.

1226
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:17,730
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1227
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,557
No, son. To us!

1228
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:29,904
My son! The King of New York!

1229
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:33,570
That's my baby!

1230
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,914
Love transcends all differences.

1231
01:17:44,592 --> 01:17:48,926
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1232
01:17:49,764 --> 01:17:53,097
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1233
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:57,865
For better, please.

1234
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,765
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1235
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,941
That's not going to last.

1236
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,013
Can I kiss the bride?

1237
01:18:07,348 --> 01:18:08,940
No! Music!

1238
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:10,776
- Struts.
- Check.

1239
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:12,108
- Flaps!
- Check.

1240
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:14,116
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1241
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:18,285
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1242
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:19,553
See you later!

1243
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:22,562
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1244
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,461
or whenever the gold runs out.

1245
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:25,893
Come back soon!

1246
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:31,062
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1247
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:33,164
You're right about that!

1248
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:35,175
As long as I'm with her...

1249
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:39,043
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1250
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,805
She has the most amazing laugh.

1251
01:18:44,652 --> 01:18:46,984
Love has no boundaries!

1252
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:50,254
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1253
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,762
Dad? What's wrong?

1254
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:58,492
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1255
01:19:00,935 --> 01:19:03,062
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1256
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:06,739
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1257
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,338
I got you, son!

1258
01:19:11,946 --> 01:19:14,278
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1259
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,783
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1260
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:20,116
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1261
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:22,383
Ain't no Marty here.

1262
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:26,894
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1263
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:30,226
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1264
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,563
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

1265
01:19:33,634 --> 01:19:36,899
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1266
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:38,802
But now that I'm home

1267
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:42,536
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

1268
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:46,207
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
