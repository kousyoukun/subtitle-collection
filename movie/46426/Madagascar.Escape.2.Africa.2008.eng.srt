00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,279
<i>I'm a private dancer</i>

430
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,795
<i>A dancer for money</i>

431
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,429
<i>Any old music will do</i>

432
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,358
Beautiful , isn't it?

433
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,477
It's amazing .

434
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,634
Guys,

435
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,516
this is where we belong .

436
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,390
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

437
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,517
Oh , I like that one.

438
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,398
It works on many levels.

439
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,993
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

440
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,713
-That, too.
-Absolutely.

441
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,711
Stations.

442
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,791
Stage one. Go !

443
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,234
Oh , no ! What have I done?

444
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,833
Come on , take the bait.

445
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,560
-What happened?
-Oh , look at the poor little guy.

446
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,034
Is it dead?

447
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,197
Stage two ! Go, go, go !

448
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,554
I will give him the kiss of life.

449
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,149
Rico !

450
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,715
Rico !

451
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,750
Reverse !

452
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,950
Gas !

453
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,269
Music!

454
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,591
No ! Stop ! Stop !

455
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,509
Stop !

456
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,160
Come back!

457
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,034
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?

458
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,434
Is she dead?

459
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,990
No !

460
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,719
You hoodlums !

461
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,799
Good heavens ! Are you okay?

462
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,111
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

463
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,030
My handbag . Such a good boy.

464
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,157
Nana can't survive without it.

465
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,675
You are one tough cookie.

466
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,990
Brownies Troop 41 6, Yonkers.

467
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,313
Okay, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

468
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,110
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...

469
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,270
Where are you going?

470
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,911
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals ! I'm too old to die.

471
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,949
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up !

472
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,432
Please ! We need to stay together.

473
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,591
Fine ! We'll go that way!

474
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,195
Does anyone want a hard candy?

475
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,590
-Easy now.
-Watch your step.

476
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,989
And right here. Okay, are you ready?

477
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,110
This is where you always slept.

478
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,873
Oh , man !

479
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,636
-Was this mine?
-Look at you . Look at him .

480
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,714
Oh , this thing . Look, look!

481
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,475
-I remember this !
-He remembers.

482
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,710
A little harder than ...

483
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,555
You never slept on the right end .
You always slept on the bottom end .

484
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,435
Is that...

485
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,234
Is that my...

486
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,480
Is that me?

487
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,270
You had the cutest little paws.

488
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,835
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

489
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,874
You did that the day we lost you .

490
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,994
Wow. I was so young .

491
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,914
What happened to me?

492
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,436
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and ...

493
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,511
It was not your fault.

494
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,829
Your father did everything he could .
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

495
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,475
Far off the reserve.

496
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,678
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

497
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,310
Well ...

498
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,116
We thought they'd killed you .

499
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,598
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

500
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,398
-That's right!
-Keep your chin in .

501
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,713
You boys be careful !
Watch out before you break something .

502
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,193
You used to call this "foofie."

503
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,793
"Foofie"?

504
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,875
Foofie.

505
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,314
He doesn't want that.

506
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,118
This is my foofie !

507
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,117
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

508
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,478
I mean , no, thank you ,
thank you . It's perfect.

509
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,236
Son , you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

510
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,517
You'll need all your strength .

511
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,069
I will bring the house down for you .

512
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,390
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you .

513
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,314
Jeez, Mom , really?

514
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,552
I know you'll do us proud .
You know why?

515
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,430
You were born with it.

516
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,072
Good night, Alakay.
My boy. My own boy.

517
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,752
My son's a king .

518
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,072
My son's a king .

519
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,633
Good night, Mom .

520
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,551
Good night, Alakay.

521
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,594
Foofie.

522
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,350
Look at foofie ! My foofie !

523
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,549
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie !

524
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,350
No sign of civilisation .
Everybody appears very tired .

525
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,791
I think we're lost.

526
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Nana, do you know where you're going?

527
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,197
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

528
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,630
Sure, right, okay. Yeah , all right.

529
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,879
-It's people.
-How did you get here?

530
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,759
-Can you help us? We're lost.
-We're lost, too.

531
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,311
It was aul . A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep !

532
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,789
-That happened to our jeep, too !
-What do we do?

533
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,069
How will we all survive?

534
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,154
No food , no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?

535
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,235
You can let nature get the best of you ,

536
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,039
or you can get the best of nature.

537
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,430
Gather 'round , children .
We're New Yorkers, right?

538
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,715
Yeah .

539
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,111
We survive the concrete jungle !

540
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,830
When we need food , we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand .

541
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,593
-Am I right?
-She's right.

542
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,957
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

543
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,119
-Exactly!
-When we need water, we build a dam .

544
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,669
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud !

545
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,675
If we can make it there,
we can make it anywhere !

546
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,230
I'm coming , King J ulien !

547
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,275
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

548
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,115
No, shark, no ! Sit!

549
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,392
Why am I laughing?

550
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,238
We have all the parts we need ,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

551
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,470
-How slightly?
-Six to nine years.

552
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,837
-Sixty-nine years?
-No, six to nine years.

553
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,789
<i>Private! What happened to our thumbs?</i>

554
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,917
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

555
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,992
Darn you , Darwin !

556
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,995
<i>Nobody goes A WOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.</i>

557
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,950
<i>Rico! You're coming with me!</i>

558
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,354
-We'll bring them in for court martial .
-That won't be necessary!

559
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,315
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you , Skipper.

560
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,511
<i>Well, I'II be a monkey's uncle.</i>

561
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,432
Oh , I doubt that.

562
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,276
<i>Enough Iollygagging. Let's get to work.</i>

563
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,558
<i>There'II be three groups. Group AIpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.</i>

564
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,599
<i>Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.</i>

565
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,034
<i>Any questions?</i>

566
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,109
<i>Good! Let's get to work.</i>

567
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,233
I'd like to kiss you , monkey man .

568
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,316
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

569
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,035
Remember, little cub scouts,
a great dance performance

570
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,554
comes from the heart.

571
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,149
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong .

572
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,030
Sure, mister.

573
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,159
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

574
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,716
-You're not nervous, are you?
-Nah , it's my thing .

575
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,430
In my opinion , the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

576
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,672
You mean , this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

577
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,990
-Like a dance-off?
-Sure.

578
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,754
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

579
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,674
Who'd be a good match for me?
J ust to keep things interesting .

580
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,750
Well , I wish I could help,

581
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,236
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred .

582
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,200
But if it was me out there,
I'd choose Teetsi .

583
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,436
Teetsi . Okay. Sounds interesting .

584
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,033
Makunga, right? Thank you .

585
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,589
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em , tiger.

586
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
Shake it out.

587
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,832
A five, six, seven , eight.

588
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,196
Let's go, let's do this.

589
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,395
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

590
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,836
-Come on , baby! Make Mama proud !
-Woman , I'm trying to take...

591
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,069
On it, Mom !

592
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,639
Who will be the first participant?

593
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,320
Me ! Oh ! Me, me, me !
Me ! Me ! Me ! Me, me ! Please, me?

594
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,116
How about you?
The tall , handsome one.

595
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,952
Yeah . Choose your opponent.

596
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,593
Let me see.

597
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,354
I guess I'll pick

598
00:10:59,480 --> 00:39:00,834
Teetsi?

599
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,793
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

600
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,236
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there !

601
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,277
Somebody, wake him up !

602
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,392
All right, so, Teetsi , come on .
Let's do this, huh?

603
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,997
Come on , little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

604
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,396
-Let's dance !
-Okay.

605
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,194
But let me warn you
that I am a protėgė of

606
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,954
Fosse and Robbins !

607
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,829
Not "dance" dance ! Fight!

608
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,719
Dance fight! You got it.

609
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,432
-Is he dancing?
-What's he doing?

610
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,830
I know that boy is not dancing .

611
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,836
This is even better than I thought.

612
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,955
Alakay, turn around !

613
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,238
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish , turn around .

614
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,118
Oh , no.

615
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,590
Alakay! Are you hurt?

616
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,353
Yeah , I am .

617
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,552
Did I . . . Did I win?

618
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,960
No, son .

619
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,917
How could this happen?

620
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,914
You told us you were a king .
A king does not get beat.

621
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,034
I am a king . I'm the King of New York.

622
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,555
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform .

623
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,596
Perform?

624
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,038
Oh , no, this is horrible !
Alakay has failed the test!

625
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,716
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish

626
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,033
his own son?

627
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,952
Zuba, no.

628
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,917
Zuba, yes.

629
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,194
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

630
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,355
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion .

631
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,953
Dad , what are you doing?

632
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,193
Dad , no ! You can't do this.

633
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,074
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

634
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,269
Anyone?

635
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,550
Someone? No one?

636
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,680
You , sir!

637
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,393
I guess not.

638
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,399
Well , I . . . This is all very awkward ,

639
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,394
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden .

640
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,195
Teetsi ! Get the hat.

641
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,159
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

642
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,311
He shall wear this Hat of Shame

643
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,153
and leave the watering hole

644
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,754
for a thousand years, or life !

645
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,352
Whichever comes last.

646
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,191
Shoo, shoo ! Get out of here !

647
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,638
You should have told us
you weren't a real king , son !

648
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,870
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

649
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,314
What did you expect?

650
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,957
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son , it's a fight! "

651
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,634
-You're a lion !
-But I never fought another lion !

652
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,552
No, I guess not. You dance !

653
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,952
And other stuff! Your pal , Makunga,
set me up back there !

654
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,759
-None of this would have happened . . .
-If you were a real lion .

655
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,797
-Zuba !
-Yeah , I said it!

656
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,754
A real lion .

657
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,355
Thanks.

658
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,399
Thanks a lot.

659
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,389
Saw.

660
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,200
Suture.

661
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,354
Swab.

662
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,960
You're in my light, Stephen .

663
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,035
You have a brown spot
on your shoulder.

664
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,671
That's very observant, Stephen . As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

665
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,435
Okay! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

666
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,750
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?

667
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,275
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you .

668
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,715
-Really?
-Go out and grab it by the horns.

669
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,475
-Thank you , Dr Mankiewicz!
-Break a leg ! Sweet kid .

670
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,719
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

671
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,077
Witch Doctor's Disease?

672
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,993
That's the most ridiculous disease
I've ever heard of.

673
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,038
-Don't ask.
-Someone's been knotty.

674
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,075
This won't hurt a bit.

675
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,438
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spot just like that.

676
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,071
-And?
-Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

677
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,595
Wednesday, no Joe?

678
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,399
I can breathe ! Thanks, doc!

679
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,474
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

680
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,076
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours !

681
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,231
But I've never heard of it.

682
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,791
I mean . . . I don't have any penicillin .

683
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,156
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started !

684
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,232
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

685
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,270
Ta-da !

686
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,960
-He has talent.
-Stupendous and tremendous.

687
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,834
Hollah !

688
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,959
Bet you've never seen that one !
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

689
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,350
-Let's all give it a try!
-Let's do it!

690
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,511
Well , you can try all you want to,

691
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,511
but it takes years of practice.

692
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,069
You'll never get a tight stream

693
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,516
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

694
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,069
purse your lips like this. You got it?

695
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,869
Ta-da !

696
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,792
How did you . . . You guys got it
right out of the box!

697
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,632
-If you can do it. . .
-. . .we can do it.

698
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,949
It's in our blood !

699
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,949
I always thought I was a bit unique.

700
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,269
We are unique !

701
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,476
We are like a force of nature !

702
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,234
-A million points of light!
-And dark stripes !

703
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,470
Exactly the same !

704
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,154
Exactly the same.

705
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,195
Looks impressive,
Kowalski , but will it fly?

706
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,796
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

707
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,190
N ice.

708
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,633
Oh , man . My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

709
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,593
I've ruined my parents' lives.

710
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,591
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

711
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,356
It is lackin' in the crackin', my friend .
I've gotta fix this.

712
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,109
So...

713
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,271
There's. . .
There's something I gotta tell you .

714
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,350
Hey, guys.

715
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,996
Is this place great or what?

716
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,150
I'd go with "or what."

717
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,915
Well , I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but

718
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,309
I got a date with Moto Moto.

719
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,950
Who's Moto Moto?

720
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,034
Oh , he's so big and handsome and big !

721
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,836
-Know what "Moto Moto" means?
-Twins?

722
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,877
It means, "Hot Hot."

723
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,195
"Hot Hot"?

724
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,398
When did you start parlez-ing African?

725
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,675
It's in my blood .

726
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,151
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr Hot Pants after I'm gone.

727
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,119
Melman , why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

728
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,316
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

729
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,960
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town !

730
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,474
Whoa, guys.

731
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,198
Main Street's mine !

732
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,317
Well , you can have it!

733
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,598
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr Hotee Moto Moto...

734
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,035
-What are you talking about?
-What are we talking about?

735
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,633
Melman , just tell her.

736
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,953
What? What are you . . .
I don't know what you're talking about.

737
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,439
I guess I'll go, then .

738
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,309
Don't bother.

739
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,791
-Don't get up on my account.
-Melman ! Gloria !

740
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,839
-I thought you guys were friends !
-Marty's absolutely right.

741
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,672
-Marty?
-Marty?

742
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,795
Marty?

743
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,757
What the heck is going on?

744
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,676
You're not. . . Oh ! He was. . . I thought
he. . . You're not him . He's. . . Oh .

745
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,310
You thought that guy was me?

746
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,916
No. I mean , yes, you . . . Guys, come on .

747
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,877
You thought I was him?

748
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,031
You guys kind of do look a little...

749
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,509
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

750
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,912
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern .

751
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,356
It's a little weird , really.
I mean , come on . Marty.

752
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,637
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

753
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,593
I'm just like any other zebra.

754
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,432
No. Of course you're different!

755
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,955
How?

756
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,910
Okay, I can't tell you apart.

757
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,874
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something .

758
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,560
-A bell?
-Okay, not a bell . Bell's a bad idea.

759
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,792
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

760
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,349
-I'm not stupid !
-Not you , stupid ! H im , stupid !

761
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,796
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

762
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,157
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

763
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,310
It's always about you , isn't it?

764
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,872
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

765
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,793
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?

766
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,273
Yeah , fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

767
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,512
That's what you do best!
J ust like back in New York!

768
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,672
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

769
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,589
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

770
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,672
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone !

771
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,109
Good , leave ! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems !

772
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,272
You're a dime a dozen !
I can't tell which one's Marty!

773
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,273
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh , yeah , I don't care !

774
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,034
N ice hat, you showoff!

775
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,120
Marty,

776
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,559
don't go.

777
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,518
Giddy-up, giddy-up !

778
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,914
Look, Maurice !

779
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,355
The perfect spot for my summer palace !

780
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,514
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

781
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,600
-Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
-What a waste.

782
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,952
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

783
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,710
I'm terminal , you know?

784
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,390
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

785
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,840
That's a bummer, man .

786
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,594
If I , King J ulien , that's my name,

787
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,355
only had two days left to live,

788
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,953
I would do all the things

789
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,395
-I've ever dreamed of doing .
-Like what?

790
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,677
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

791
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,958
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

792
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,031
make my living out of it.

793
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,435
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighbouring country

794
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,400
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

795
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,710
Easy for you to say. You're a king .

796
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,794
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head .

797
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,875
There must be something
you want to do before you die !

798
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,919
-There is this one thing .
-What? Tell me.

799
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,040
-No, I couldn't.
-What is it?

800
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,476
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.

801
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,392
What is it? Please tell me !

802
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,632
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

803
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,233
How I've always felt about her.

804
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,118
Fine. Don't tell me !

805
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,434
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman .

806
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,639
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

807
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,076
Yeah . Yeah . You're right.

808
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,438
You've got to march
right up to this woman .

809
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,876
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward .

810
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,554
J ust a little, or almost all the way.

811
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,874
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're

812
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,396
just lips' distance
away from each other.

813
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,355
Then you tell her
how much you hate her.

814
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,593
Actually, it's more like love her.

815
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,798
Oh , you sly dog ! Woof, woof!

816
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,311
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

817
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,114
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

818
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,679
-He didn't hear you .
-I can't hear you !

819
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,429
-You got to rise up !
-Rising up !

820
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,592
-Get out of the hole !
-I'm rising out of the ground !

821
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,518
-He's rising , Maurice.
-I'm rising , Maurice !

822
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,712
-Rising !
-You go right up to this woman !

823
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,714
Do you feel it?

824
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,110
-Go up to her face !
-Tell the truth !

825
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,876
-I'm going to tell her!
-Then you say, "Baby, I dig you ! "

826
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,592
Yeah ! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

827
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,038
I love that happy little head .

828
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,872
<i>She Iove</i>

829
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,315
<i>Moto Moto</i>

830
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,118

00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,349
<i>Moto Moto</i>

832
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,910
<i>She Ioves me
She Ioves my eyes</i>

833
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,076
<i>She Ioves me
She Ioves my thighs</i>

834
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,472
<i>She Ioves my roundness</i>

835
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,549
<i>She Iove that I'm chunky
She Iove that I'm plumpy</i>

836
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,913
<i>She Iove my heftiness
She Iove my zestiness</i>

837
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,834
<i>She Iove me restlessly

838
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,599

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,239
<i>'cause she Iove me</i>

840
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,080
Moto Moto,

841
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,792
before things get too serious, well ,

842
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,194
I was wondering ,
if I were to, for example, stay here,

843
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,670
I'd like to ask you ...

844
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,993
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my ear canal .

845
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,754
I have so many questions.

846
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,276
I promise the answer will always be yes.

847
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,194
U nless no is required .

848
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,513
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

849
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,074
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

850
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,037
Okay. Other than that.

851
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,838
Let's see.

852
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,912
Yeah , well , you know, you chunky.

853
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,280
Right.

854
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,630
My gosh , girl , you huge.

855
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,910
You said that.

856
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,878
Yeah , that's right.

857
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,792
We don't have to talk no more.

858
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,275
Gloria !

859
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,595
Gloria.

860
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,875
Melman .

861
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,352
Melman , I want you to meet Moto Moto.

862
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,993
Moto Moto. Yeah , nice to meet you .

863
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,955
-I guess I . . .
-It's okay, Melman .

864
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,394
Apology accepted .

865
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,156
Oh . Yeah , right, that.
That's why I . . . Good .

866
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,233
Okay. Well , that's it, then .

867
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,273
Good . We're kind of busy here, man .

868
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,829
No. No, that's not it.

869
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,352
Listen , Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen .

870
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,157
Because you , my friend ,
you found yourself the perfect woman .

871
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,800
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman ,

872
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,760
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers. Okay?

873
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,635
Her favourites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed .

874
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,109
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

875
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,952
No crust, the way she likes it.

876
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,351
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend .

877
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,270
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh .

878
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,035
She has the most amazing laugh .

879
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,392
That's what I would do if I were you .

880
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,235
But I'm not, so you do it.

881
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,958
Okay.

882
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,394
What?

883
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,713
That was beautiful .

884
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,313
Anyways, where were we?

885
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,200
I'm "huge"?

886
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,798
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

887
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,032
Well , I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion !

888
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,432
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up !

889
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,390
This is for stealing my dad's job !
This is for humiliating my family!

890
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,955
And making me look like a fool !

891
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,760
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

892
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,560
Coward .

893
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,795
The water. It's gone.

894
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,996
It's never gone dry before.

895
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,959
-We'll need a lot more dying holes.
-How could this happen?

896
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,237
Out of my way! What is going on here?

897
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,312
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us !

898
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,755
-Good observation , Shirley.
-I'm Bobby.

899
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,319
Makunga, what do we do?

900
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,879
Quiet!

901
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,275
Listen up ! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis,

902
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,640
we'll all have to fight for it.

903
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,280
-We can't fight for it.
-That's crazy.

904
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,916
That's not fair. You'd win !

905
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,195
Exactly, Shirley.

906
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,600
I'm Bob...

907
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,516
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

908
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,592
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion .

909
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,275
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

910
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,319
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

911
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,830
-Off the reserve?
-It's too dangerous !

912
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,109
H unters would shoot us !

913
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,077
No one leaves the reserve and survives !

914
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,958
I left the reserve !

915
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,193
And survived .

916
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,717
I can do something about this.

917
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,271
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

918
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,078
-U priver?
-Off the reserve?

919
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,275
You?

920
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,512
Yeah . I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

921
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,754
Great! I'd help you pack, but by
the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

922
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,351
Fine. Go ahead , laugh . Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong .

923
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,913
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.

924
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,074
Zuba would know what to do.

925
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,992
-Where's Zuba?
-You don't care about us.

926
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,230
Zuba should be in charge, not you .

927
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,639
All right, fine !

928
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,758
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba !

929
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,200
Marty?

930
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,912
Hey! Marty!

931
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,713
Marty?

932
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,589
Marty.

933
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,633
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

934
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,870
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

935
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,318
H i . Is Marty in there?

936
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,550
Anyone seen Marty?

937
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,671
Which one of us is Marty?

938
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,753
All right. Well , if you see him ,

939
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,951
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

940
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,839
Goodbye? Don't go.
Where are you going?

941
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,151
-Can we come?
-No. I have to do this alone.

942
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,390
You can't leave the reserve !

943
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,794
What are you doing?

944
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,871
-They'll get your hat.
-H unters are everywhere !

945
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,234
Could you leave the hat?

946
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,993
Marty! I know you're in there.

947
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,112
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

948
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,549
You've been a great friend .

949
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,076
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

950
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,992
that I never think of you having any.

951
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,834
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

952
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,232
J ust like back at the zoo.

953
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,598
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend , I guess.

954
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,873
I just want you to know that I ...

955
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,672
You're one in a million .

956
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,673
This is touching .

957
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,159
It is touching .

958
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,476
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

959
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,991
That's right. Gotcha !

960
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,950
I see you in there ! Yeah , you .

961
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,798
You , right there.

962
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,192
Twelfth row, two hundred and third
from the left.

963
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,874
That's you , Marty.

964
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,873
I know it's you .

965
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,877
Know what makes you special?

966
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,558
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

967
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,318
You're a dreamer, Marty.

968
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,270
Always have been .
You have great taste in music

969
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,236
and horrible taste in friends.

970
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,517
Well , not Melman and Gloria, but me.

971
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,149
Okay, I'm in .

972
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,430
Marty, you can't come with me.

973
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,272
You don't have a choice.

974
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,954
-People are out there !
-You're crazy! Come back!

975
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,233
The people will get you !

976
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,437
Don't lose the hat!

977
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,280
Bye, hat!

978
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,430
Any water?

979
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,153
No, just more diamonds and gold .

980
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,675
Don't give up hope.

981
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,673
Listen up ! I will help you !

982
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,912
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

983
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,159
I , your beloved King J ulien

984
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,516
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

985
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,433
in the volcano !

986
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,190
What does that do?

987
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,954
What does that do? Excellent question .

988
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,272
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

989
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,554
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

990
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,189
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

991
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,999
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough ."

992
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,196
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

993
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,715
"I don't want another sacrifice ! "

994
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,077
"Look at you ! You're skinny! "
"No ! I've had enough ! "

995
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,718
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful .

996
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,714
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you .

997
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,399
What?

998
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,595
Does it work?

999
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,275
No ! I mean , yes.

1000
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,554
Well , Maurice?

1001
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,995
Ah , it's 50-50.

1002
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,312
We'll do it!

1003
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,120
Excellent!

1004
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,754
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

1005
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,831
and get eaten by gods.

1006
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,914
Any hands ! Hands, anybody!

1007
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,550
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

1008
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,836
who could look death straight
in the eyeball . A real , genuine hero.

1009
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,957
-I'll do it.
-Melman?

1010
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,479
H urry up ! Before we all
come to our senses !

1011
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,431
Melman , what is wrong with you?

1012
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:01,196
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1013
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,352
Are you nuts?

1014
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,636
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1015
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,634
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going .

1016
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,791
It was always you .

1017
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,389
Seeing you every day.

1018
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,630
That's what kept me going .

1019
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,271
Melman ! Wait!

1020
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,596
Melman ! Melman ! Melman !

1021
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,314
You going to mope like this all day?

1022
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,439
Don't "hmph" me.

1023
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,395
Listen , Zuba. A miracle happened .

1024
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,316
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

1025
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,550
What are you saying , woman?

1026
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,638
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again .

1027
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,514
Zuba !

1028
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,998
-Zuba !
-Get out of here !

1029
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,839
What do you want?

1030
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,149
It's aul .

1031
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,474
The watering hole is dried up.

1032
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,518
Dried up? That's impossible !

1033
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,432
There's nothing left!

1034
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,355
You're alpha lion , Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1035
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,559
Your son , Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.

1036
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,278
-Off the reserve?
-No !

1037
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,079
I tried to stop him .
I told him it was suicide.

1038
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,993
He was determined
to prove himself to you .

1039
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,679
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1040
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,033
H urry, Zuba !

1041
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,998
I'm so parched .

1042
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,313
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1043
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:56,959
We'll slip in , find the problem .
H unters will never know we were here.

1044
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,270
Why are we doing this?

1045
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,796
Maybe my dad will think I'm ...

1046
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,351
I want to show him I'm a real lion .

1047
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,671
As opposed to a chocolate lion .

1048
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,153
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1049
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,389
What?

1050
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,237
As far as my dad is concerned .

1051
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,039
As far as people are concerned ,
you're a hit.

1052
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,238
In New York. This is Africa.
Much tougher crowd .

1053
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,351
Marty, this is it!

1054
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,789
This is the clog ! Come on .

1055
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,350
Well , there's the water.

1056
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,829
Stay down . Look at that.

1057
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,560
Knit one, purl two.

1058
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,596
It's her.

1059
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,193
-Is this right?
-Very good .

1060
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,191
Nana, slow down .

1061
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,199
You're a little tangled , aren't you?

1062
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,635
No, don't pull . I'll do it.

1063
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,193
We need dynamite. Got any?

1064
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,399
Oh , snap ! I just used
my last stick this morning !

1065
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,392
-Savages !
-Evasive manoeuvres !

1066
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,790
-Serpentine, serpentine !
-Squiggly squid manoeuvre !

1067
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,679
Zag , zig-zag , zig ziggy zag !

1068
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,470
No, no ! Squiggly squid !

1069
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,630
Etch A Sketch !

1070
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,712
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus !

1071
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,671
-Run , Marty!
-I can't leave you here !

1072
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,797
Go get help ! Squiggly squid manoeuvre !
Go ! Go ! Squiggly squid !

1073
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,793
Etch A Sketch ! Etch A Sketch !

1074
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,312
<i>Save us
We Iove you</i>

1075
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,754
Okay.

1076
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,834
Okay, okay, okay.

1077
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,392
<i>-Save us
-Melman</i>

1078
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,232
<i>-We Iove you
-Melman</i>

1079
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,355
<i>Save us</i>

1080
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,909
Okay, here we go. Okay, okay.

1081
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,559
<i>-Melman
-We Iove you</i>

1082
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,313
<i>-Melman
-Save us</i>

1083
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,074
Here we go ! Here we go !

1084
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,390
-What's all the hoopla about?
-Joe?

1085
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,994
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead !

1086
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,790
So did I . Then I realised
I'm covered in brown spots.

1087
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,953
So, Melman's not dying !

1088
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,194
-Melman's not dying !
-Oh , no !

1089
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,429
Melman !

1090
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,069
Move !

1091
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,516
Don't do this ! J ulien , stop this !
This is crazy!

1092
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,874
Oh , suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1093
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,950
Yes !

1094
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,395
-Please, Melman ! Stop !
-Gloria?

1095
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,949
-You can't do this !
-Why not?

1096
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,400
Because...

1097
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,159
You can't do this, Melman .

1098
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,913
First, that hurts.

1099
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,472
Second , I've only got
1 8 hours to live, anyway.

1100
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,074
Melman , I gotta know,

1101
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,749
did you mean those things
you said about me?

1102
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,314
Of course I did .

1103
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,711
-That's crazy.
-It is?

1104
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,114
It's crazy to think I had to go
haltway around the world

1105
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,873
to find out the perfect guy for me

1106
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,833
lived right next door.

1107
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,955
Then it's you and me, neighbour.

1108
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,993
You and me for the next 1 8 hours.

1109
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,230
I'll take whatever you got.

1110
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,791
-Maurice, what happened?
-I believe the fat lady has sung .

1111
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,509
-What's going on here?
-Marty!

1112
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,833
Alex is in big trouble !
We got to get upriver fast!

1113
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,150
-What about the plane?
-Perfect! Come on !

1114
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,950
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1115
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,798
Now, maternity leave.

1116
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,316
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1117
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,789
We need that plane
for a rescue mission .

1118
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,480
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union .

1119
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,235
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going .

1120
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,678
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1121
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:29,275
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savannah .

1122
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,080
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1123
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,800
Finally.

1124
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,716
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1125
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,475
Oh , no ! Please ! Don't put me there ! No !

1126
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,435
This is wrong .

1127
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,990
You see? You are survivors.

1128
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:04,869
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1129
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,199
You can't eat a lion .

1130
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,998
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken .

1131
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,390
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1132
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,356
She's out of her mind , people !

1133
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,430
I'm from New York City!

1134
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,589
It's me, Alex the Lion !
From Central Park!

1135
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:29,550
Dad !

1136
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,753
What were you thinking , son?
You got no business being out here !

1137
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,513
Stay behind me.

1138
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,752
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1139
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,160
Stay back!

1140
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,791
You'd let your dinner get away?

1141
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,470
-What are you doing?
-The only thing I know how to do.

1142
01:10:59,680 --> 01:10:00,670
What the heck?

1143
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,433
Hey, I know those moves.

1144
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,555
Alex?

1145
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,354
-It's Alex the Lion !
-From Central Park!

1146
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,750
It is Alex!

1147
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,520
Only one lion can move like that!

1148
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,269
He's beautiful .

1149
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,919
I can't believe it.

1150
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,630
How does he do that?

1151
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,710
What are you doing?

1152
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,474
I'm dancing with my son ! I think.

1153
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,353
Don't think, Dad . Feel !

1154
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,273
Butterfly!

1155
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,590
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1156
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,991
Roar!

1157
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,274
That was beautiful . Now let's eat!

1158
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,479
Dad , look out!

1159
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,350
What the...

1160
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,192
Alex! Get in !

1161
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,035
She's got a gun ! Get out while we can !

1162
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,952
-What?
-She's got a gun !

1163
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,350
Get out while we can ! Pass it on !

1164
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:52,432
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam . Basset hound .

1165
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,916
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam .

1166
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,833
-All right! But it's his funeral .
-What?

1167
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,240
-Hard to port!
-Aye-aye, Skippy!

1168
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,829
Bring it on ! Bring it on !

1169
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,875
Come back! That's my dinner!

1170
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,633
Kowalski , full throttle.

1171
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,990
Music!

1172
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,994
-I like this song .
-It never gets old .

1173
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,994
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1174
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,430
<i>Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!</i>

1175
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,992
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go !

1176
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,600
Tell them no ! Pull up ! They'll kill us !

1177
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,672
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on !

1178
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,158
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound .

1179
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,635
Are you sure?

1180
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,635
Men , there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1181
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,518
No ! Medic!

1182
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,319
Ramming speed !

1183
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,354
Bring it on !

1184
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,192
Bad kitties.

1185
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,552
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1186
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,475
The science seemed so solid .

1187
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,476
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling .

1188
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,152
It's you ! I found you !

1189
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,230
Mort?

1190
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,033
Bad fishy!

1191
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,797
I wonder if the gods like seafood .

1192
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,553
Let's find out.

1193
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,953
Look, Maurice.

1194
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,792
-That was quick.
-I did it!

1195
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,394
I did it! I did it!

1196
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:15,996
Okay, you did it!

1197
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,633
Oh , yes !

1198
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,270
Look!

1199
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,432
-It's Alakay!
-It's Zuba !

1200
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,800
You did it!

1201
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,311
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1202
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,711
Zuba ! Alakay!

1203
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,074
You're back!

1204
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,391
I'm so glad you're safe !

1205
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,833
Out of my way.

1206
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,470
Well , well , well .

1207
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,551
You know, Zuba, if I remember
correctly, you quit the pride.

1208
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,512
And you were kicked out.

1209
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:23,679
So don't think that this
changes anything .

1210
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,550
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation .

1211
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,757
A man bag .
Very popular where I'm from .

1212
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,400
-Don't know what to say.
-Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1213
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:39,192
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking .

1214
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,998
But you're still banished .

1215
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,191
We figured you'd say that.

1216
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,430
My handbag !

1217
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,674
You bad kitty!

1218
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,152
No, no, no, no, no, no, no !

1219
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,631
You deserve this, son .

1220
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,910
Welcome to the pride.

1221
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,279
Thanks, Dad . But this belongs to you .

1222
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,234
No, son . To us !

1223
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,593
My son ! The King of New York!

1224
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,271
That's my baby!

1225
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,995
Love transcends all differences.

1226
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,638
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1227
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,911
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1228
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,635
For better, please.

1229
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,514
What a beautiful , weird couple !

1230
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,832
That's not going to last.

1231
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,837
Can I kiss the bride?

1232
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,513
No ! Music!

1233
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,435
-Struts.
-Check.

1234
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,510
-Flaps !
-Check.

1235
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,671
-Diamonds and gold .
-Check.

1236
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,878
-Bye-bye !
-We'll miss you !

1237
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,155
See you later!

1238
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,153
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1239
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,600
or whenever the gold runs out.

1240
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,637
Come back soon !

1241
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,635
Mom , let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1242
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,279
You're right about that!

1243
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,516
As long as I'm with her

1244
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,389
and you two, I don't care where we are.

1245
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,674
She has the most amazing laugh .

1246
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,437
Love has no boundaries !

1247
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,751
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1248
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,230
Dad? What's wrong?

1249
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,994
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and ...

1250
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,758
-You got me !
-I got you , son !

1251
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,196
You got me with my thing .
You brought it back around on me.

1252
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,033
I got you , son !

1253
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,796
The old man's not too bad , eh , Marty?

1254
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,235
-Marty? Who's Marty?
-Come on .

1255
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,751
-I don't know no Marty.
-You can't fool me.

1256
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,751
Ain't no Marty here.

1257
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:27,277
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you .

1258
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,591
<i>See, I've been travelling
Been travelling forever</i>

1259
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,991
<i>But now that I found a home
feels Iike I'm in heaven</i>

1260
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,232
<i>See, I've been travelling
Been travelling forever</i>

1261
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,311
<i>But now that I'm home</i>

1262
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,075
