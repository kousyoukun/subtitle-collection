1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,270
Well done, boys. Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,710
No, no, son . Over here.

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
See the lion? Look at the lion and get the lion .

4
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,000
Now, son , if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,520
and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,720
Da-da.

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,470
Now, Alakay, let me show you something , okay?

8
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,190
You see this mark?

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,670
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,200
When you're bigger, you'll be alpha lion , just like me.

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,430
No, Alakay. No dancing !

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,880
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,110
You're a strange kid . You're a strange one. I'm ...

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, come on , let's try it again .

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,910
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,040
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,240
Makunga. You're not challenging me again , are you?

20
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,960
Look on the bright side. After I defeat you and become alpha lion ,

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,080
you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son .

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,440
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you ,

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,080
why do you want to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm better looking , I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart,

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,560
and I want everyone else to do what I say.

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,520
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,640
Pay attention , Alakay. Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,070
Two, three !

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,760
-Who's the alpha lion? -You are.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,030
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Alakay?

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,630
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,240
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,360
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,470
It just gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,560
Daddy!

38
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,550
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,840
Alakay!

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,390
Da-da !

41
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,790
No ! No ! No !

42
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,390
Alakay!

43
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
-Daddy! -Daddy's got you ! Hold on !

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,230
Da-da !

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,870
Alakay!

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,360
Daddy!

47
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,440
I've been around the world in the pouring rain

48
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,880
Feeling out ofplace and feeling strange

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
Take me to a place where they know my name

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,200
'Cause I ain 't met nobody that Iooks the same

51
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

52
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,960
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

53
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,560
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

55
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples

56
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,720
PIay thatjungle fever Show 'em some Iove

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,600

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,110
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone

59
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,120
To relate to, to relate to

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,710
I'm feeling right at home

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,200
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,560
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home

63
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
See I been travelling Been travelling forever...

64
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
-I don't like the looks of this guy. -He's kind of cute.

65
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,310
He's kind of a showoff.

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,750
You think he's cute?

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,110
Roar!

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,520
The King of New York City...

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,350
...AIex the Lion!

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,920
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,840
The guy's an animal .

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,920
Maybe he should take a break. You know, we could all use a vacation .

73
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,040
Come on , where would we go on vacation?

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,350
I don't know about you , but I want to go to Connecticut!

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,800
On the Ioose, several animals, including the world famous AIex the Lion,

76
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,100
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,720
He was a very bad kitty.

79
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,440
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo otficials

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,720
to have the animals sent to Africa,

81
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,160
were stunned to Iearn that the freighter carrying the animals

82
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,280
was reported missing today.

83
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,120
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo

84
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,640
to mourn the Ioss of their beloved zoo animals.

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,400
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?

86
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
I Iike to move it, move it

87
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
He Iikes to move it, move it

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
She Iikes to move it, move it

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
-We Iike to -Move it!

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,600
Come on ! Y'all know this one ! It never gets stale !

91
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,160
-We Iike to -Move it!

92
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets ! You've been a great crowd !

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,070
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.

94
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,270
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan , feel free to call first.

95
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,360
Seriously though , call . Okay?

96
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,110
Settle down , everybody. Be quiet!

97
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,390
You can't leave without this !

98
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
Surprise, freaks !

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,390
Shake it! Shake it.

100
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone !

101
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,830
I'm a lady! Not really! It's me, King J ulien !

102
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,190
Which of you is attracted to me? Hands up !

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Hey, freaks ! You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you .

104
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,840
Oh , no, thank you .

105
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
Yes, thank you . It's my plane !

106
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,100
U ntil I return with the spoils from the new country,

107
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,790
Stevie will be in charge !

108
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't think they like that idea.

109
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,590
What are you saying , Stevie?

110
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,110
No.

111
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,280
Could we. . . No, you didn't say that! How is that even possible?

112
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,080
Naughty little thing ! Stevie says...

113
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,070
Let them eat cake !

114
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,160
King J ulien , wait for me !

115
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,710
I'm all packed ! I have a whole itinerary planned !

116
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh , no ! It's Mort! He's so annoying !

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,200
Don't let him on . Stop that thing !

118
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,240
He's carrying scissors and hand cream !

119
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,550
Everybody in ! Quickly, get in , get in ! Get in quick!

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
-Struts. -Check.

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
-Flaps. -Check.

122
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,830
-Engine. Coffee maker. -Check.

123
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,310
You guys !

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,750
Oopsie-daisy!

125
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen .

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,520
But it'll have to do. Attention .

127
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,160
This is your captain speaking.

128
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,520
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head

129
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,560
then kiss your. . .good-bye.

130
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,520
New York City, here we come !

131
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,270
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.

132
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,550
Personal God , hunk. . . What?

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
We are go, sir.

134
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,630
Open the door! I'm outside !

135
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,800
If cabin pressure is lost,

136
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,880
place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression .

137
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,320
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?

138
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,630
-No, sir. -Okay, boys, launch !

139
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,120
Launch !

140
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
-Launch ! -Launch !

141
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,710
Gremlin !

142
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,550
Hey, Mort.

143
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,800
H i !

144
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,920
That was weird .

145
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,480
-Somebody's dreaming . -I think I saw Mort on the plane wing .

146
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,920
You got Madagascar on the brain .

147
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,400
I know I'm gonna miss it.

148
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,320
It was incredible. I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.

149
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,200
Like when you bit me on the butt?

150
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.

151
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,600
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.

152
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,480
Are the butts next to the croutons?

153
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,950
You don't need to be sarcastic.

154
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,280
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding programme.

155
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,320
Breeding programme?

156
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,120
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.

157
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,360
Settle down , have a relationship.

158
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,520
I can see that.

159
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,480
What? Like dating?

160
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,990
Yeah , dating .

161
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,630
Other. . . Other guys?

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,560
What do you mean , other guys?

163
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,790
Darn it!

164
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,480
What is holding up that beverage service?

165
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,310
I'm gonna go check.

166
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,680
You all keep talking . I'm gonna catch a few winks.

167
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,990
It's so funny!

168
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
I like laughing ! It's such a nice experience !

169
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,000
To laugh !

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you mind going back? This is first class.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,920
It's nothing personal . We're just better than you . Maurice, I'm open ! H it me !

172
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,680
-He shoots, he scores ! -Is that Vivaldi?

173
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,360
-In-flight slave. -Can I help you , Mr Mankiewicz?

174
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,760
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

175
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,910
We were checking on our drink order.

176
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,190
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

177
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,960
-I guess I'll go back. . . -Where's your body?

178
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,520
You're freaking me out! Can you please go over there, please?

179
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,720
What happened to the separation of the classes?

180
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,550
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad .

181
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,270
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

182
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,720
Skipper, look.

183
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,270
Analysis.

184
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual , like a malfunction .

185
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,040
-I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic. -That too, sir.

186
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,430
Right! Rico? Manual !

187
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,560
Problemo solved .

188
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,080
-We may be out of fuel . -Why do you think so?

189
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,510
We've lost engine one,

190
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,600
and engine two is no longer on fire.

191
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,680
Buckle up, boys.

192
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,910
Don't look, doll . This might get hairy.

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,400
Attention! This is your captain.

194
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,470
I have good and bad news. The good news is, we're Ianding immediately.

195
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,590
The bad news is, we're crash-Ianding.

196
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,240
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.

197
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,600
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

198
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,430
Raise your arms, Maurice ! It's more fun when you raise your arms !

199
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,960
I can fly!

200
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,040
This could be it, Marty! I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend !

201
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,280
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

202
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,080
-And you won't mind when I tell you . . . -Tell me anything !

203
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,960
I broke your i Pod !

204
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
The buttons were so small ! It made me mad !

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,640
-The horror! -I'm sorry!

206
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,040
-I'll kill you , butt-biter! -It was an accident!

207
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,800
-An accident! -Butt-biter!

208
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,630
I love you , Gloria ! I always have !

209
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Like you love the beach . Or a good book. Or the beach .

210
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,840
Goodness, doll , you're shaking like a leaf.

211
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
Rico, you've had your fun .

212
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,830
Pull up.

213
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,870
Gear down .

214
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,600
Gently. You just want to kiss the ground .

215
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,270
J ust a peck, a smooch , like you'd kiss your sister.

216
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,840
I said , kiss it!

217
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,480
Now just a little brake. J ust a touch .

218
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,350
I believe that's checkmate.

219
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,100
Commence emergency landing procedure. Flaps up ! Deploy!

220
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,190
Oh , we're here.

221
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,680
What in the world?

222
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
What happened to the plane? What did y'all do to the plane?

223
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm okay. I'm alive.

224
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,640
I can't even sleep for a minute. This is not J FK.

225
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,520
Kowalski , casualty report.

226
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,920
Two passengers unaccounted for.

227
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,760
That's a number I can live with . Good landing , boys.

228
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,120
Who says a penguin can't fly?

229
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Hey, happy slappers ! Is there some reason to celebrate?

230
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,680
Look at the plane !

231
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,960
-We'll fix it. -How are you gonna you fix this?

232
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,240
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

233
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,920
We should be up and running in , say, six to nine months.

234
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
-Sixty-nine months? -No, six to nine months.

235
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,000
Kowalski , I say we use this setback to our advantage.

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,360
-Where'd you get that number? -I want you to reconfigure the design .

237
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,760
How do you estimate that?

238
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,440
Pretty boy! Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.

239
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,960
Hold on . Who made you king of the plane wreck?

240
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,160
Excuse me? Fine.

241
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
You can be in charge. You fix the plane.

242
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,520
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?

243
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,840
Okay, then I'll remain in charge.

244
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
Yeah , you will remain in charge.

245
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,560
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.

246
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,240
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

247
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,120
-Good for you . -Well , this discussion isn't over.

248
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,840
H igher mammals ! Stay with us.

249
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,960
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.

250
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
Phil ! I should wash your hands out with soap.

251
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,640
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?

252
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,480
You know, grit and spit and spit.

253
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,550
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.

254
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,000
That don't sound too promising .

255
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
You're right. We're stuck here.

256
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,480
As long as we're together, we'll be okay.

257
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,920
Yeah , but love ain't gonna get us home.

258
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,200
Behold ! The lion !

259
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,880
-People ! -There is much to see. Moving on .

260
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,390
Wait, wait, wait! People !

261
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,680
-They'll help us ! -Wait up !

262
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,150
-People ! Stop ! -Help us !

263
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,320
If you stop, I'll autograph those !

264
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,880
I know you !

265
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
You .

266
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,030
It's the bad kitty.

267
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,190
How do you like some of that?

268
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,710
Come in , Tokyo !

269
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,960
Right in the batteries.

270
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,750
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?

271
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,070
Next time, I won't go so easy on you !

272
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,040
Thank you , dear.

273
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
Moving on !

274
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
Are you out of your mind?

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
We need help and you harass old ladies?

276
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
Out of my mind?

277
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,080
Who's out of my mind now?

278
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
-See if you can get an operator. -No problem .

279
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
Out of my mind . We're going home.

280
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,720
Message E-4.

281
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.

282
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,080
PIease try again Iater.

283
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,030
Am I trippin'?

284
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,510
All those zebras like me.

285
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,270
-Where are we? -San Diego.

286
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,950
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

287
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,040
-I know this place. -I think it's Africa.

288
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,790
-Africa? -It's got to be.

289
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,350
Our ancestral crib.

290
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,880
It's in our blood . I can feel it!

291
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,390
No, it's more than that. It's like

292
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,710
d?j¨¢ vu , like I've been here before.

293
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,640
It's like Roots!

294
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,120
No, it's like

295
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,590
d?j¨¢ vu , like I've been here before.

296
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,030
How!

297
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,320
How!

298
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,440
Me Alex!

299
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,590
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird .

300
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,230
Then plummet!

301
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,670
Smash ground !

302
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,100
Go boom !

303
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,390
Then here we emerge.

304
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,710
We offer only happiness and good greetings.

305
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,990
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

306
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,350
Yeah . We just. . . Yeah .

307
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,240
I thought. . . Sorry.

308
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,600
You came from off the reserve?

309
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,430
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo, actually.

310
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,200
Don't strain yourself.

311
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,560
What's going on here?

312
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,240
They say they're from off the reserve.

313
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,680
That's impossible. Only people come from off the reserve.

314
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,200
You look familiar. Do I know you?

315
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,560
How could you survive the hunters?

316
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,960
We didn't see any hunters.

317
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,040
-What are you looking at? -Me? Nothing .

318
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,200
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed .

319
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,920
So skedaddle back to where you came from .

320
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
Is there a manager we could talk to?

321
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,560
I see. You're here to challenge me !

322
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,080
What? No ! No.

323
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,320
That's what it looks like to me !

324
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,960
Zuba ! Wait.

325
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm trying to take care of business...

326
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,230
Yeah , yeah , Zuba. Hold on .

327
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,440
Alakay?

328
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,920
Is that you?

329
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
No, it's Alex. Ix. Like New York Knicks.

330
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,640
Zuba, look!

331
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
I've always had that. The vet checked it out.

332
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,270
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

333
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,560
A mark.

334
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,910
All right, this is a little weird .

335
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,350
Honey, he's come home.

336
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,920
What?

337
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,350
You've come home.

338
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,800
Son .

339
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,800
Dad .

340
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad !

341
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,480
Mom and Dad ! It's my mom and dad !

342
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,160
I got a mom and dad !

343
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,600
My baby's alive !

344
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,920
Dad !

345
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,190
My son !

346
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,430
My son is home !

347
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,280
Alakay! Alakay has come home !

348
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Alakay! Yeah ! The prodigal son returns. This is perfect!

349
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,350
I thought you hated Zuba.

350
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,160
No, I do. I do. I do. I hate him . Oh , I do.

351
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,000
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

352
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all !

353
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,160
Giddy-up, feathered horse !

354
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,200
Make way! Move out of the way! Stand aside !

355
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,870
New York!

356
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,320
It's a bit of a dump. Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

357
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,520
Hello, New Yorkers ! Your new king is here !

358
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,880
This calls for a celebration !

359
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,760
Maurice, I think they like me.

360
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,040
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!

361
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
Chukka-chukka what?

362
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,520
Excuse me. I'm Marty. I'm kind of new around here.

363
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,030
Hey, Marty!

364
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,600
You're a good-looking group ! You like to run?

365
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
Yeah . Running is crack-a-lackin'.

366
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,880
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

367
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,080
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.

368
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,680
What? You don't have doctors here?

369
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Not anymore.

370
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,680
Well , what if you catch a cold?

371
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,910
We go over to the dying holes and we die.

372
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,680
You guys really need a doctor.

373
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,960
-We have an opening . -Would you be interested?

374
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,430
Me? A doctor?

375
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,880
It's raining men . Hallelujah ! You all got it going on .

376
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,760
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

377
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,600
Oh , I got rid of those. Listen , girls.

378
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,520
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.

379
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,080
Hey, everybody!

380
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,230
I just found out that my son is a doggone king !

381
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,430
The King of New York!

382
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,520
Show me some of your moves, son . Don't be bashful .

383
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,190
All right. This one always knocks 'em dead .

384
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,760
Roar!

385
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,640
Look out. The King is mad . The King is mad !

386
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,510
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms !

387
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,800
Welcome to the herd , Marty!

388
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,200
Me? I've always wanted to be part of a herd !

389
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,560
-It's one for all . . . -And all for all , y'all !

390
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,000
How do I look?

391
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,100
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.

392
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,950
Don't worry, it's just a clip-on .

393
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,790
Voil¨¢ ! He's a witch doctor!

394
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,280
My mother will be so happy.

395
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,160
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you .

396
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,200
Here he comes.

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,560
I Iike 'em big

398
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
I Iike 'em chunky

399
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,040
I Iike 'em big I Iike 'em plumpy

400
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I Iike 'em round With somethin ' somethin '

401
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,160
They Iike my sound They think I'm funky

402
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,880
Goodness, girl , you huge.

403
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,680
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

404
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,560
You as quick as you are hefty.

405
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,920
So you're Moto Moto?

406
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,440
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

407
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,080
I kind of like it, fatso.

408
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,280
I'll see you around , girl . It won't be hard , because you so plumpy.

409
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,870
Oops !

410
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,200
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

411
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,680
but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son .

412
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,360
-What are you talking about? -It's nothing , really.

413
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,920
They're griping that Alakay never went through

414
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,720
the rite of passage, blah , blah , blah ,

415
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,720
so technically speaking , he can't be a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

416
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
I forgot about the rite of passage.

417
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,520
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

418
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,160
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

419
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,640
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.

420
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,560
-A show-of-skill talent show deal? -Yeah . Strutting their stuff.

421
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,760
A performance ! I think that's up my alley.

422
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,640
If it's tradition , I want to do it. Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

423
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
I want to be Alaki .

424
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,840
-Alakay. -Alakay! Even better.

425
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,600
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning !

426
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,440
That's wonderful ! Good luck, Alakay.

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,600
Where I'm from , we say, "Break a leg ."

428
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,750
That's my boy!

429
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,360
I'm a private dancer

430
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,800
A dancer for money

431
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,430
Any old music will do

432
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,440
Beautiful , isn't it?

433
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,480
It's amazing .

434
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,630
Guys,

435
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,520
this is where we belong .

436
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,480
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

437
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,600
Oh , I like that one.

438
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,480
It works on many levels.

439
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,990
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

440
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,800
-That, too. -Absolutely.

441
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Stations.

442
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,790
Stage one. Go !

443
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,320
Oh , no ! What have I done?

444
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,920
Come on , take the bait.

445
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,560
-What happened? -Oh , look at the poor little guy.

446
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,030
Is it dead?

447
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,200
Stage two ! Go, go, go !

448
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,550
I will give him the kiss of life.

449
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,150
Rico !

450
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,720
Rico !

451
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,750
Reverse !

452
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,040
Gas !

453
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,270
Music!

454
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,590
No ! Stop ! Stop !

455
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,510
Stop !

456
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,160
Come back!

457
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,030
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?

458
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,430
Is she dead?

459
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,990
No !

460
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,720
You hoodlums !

461
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,880
Good heavens ! Are you okay?

462
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,110
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

463
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,120
My handbag . Such a good boy.

464
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,240
Nana can't survive without it.

465
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,760
You are one tough cookie.

466
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,080
Brownies Troop 41 6, Yonkers.

467
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,310
Okay, nobody panic! The best thing we can do is stay together.

468
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,200
We'll wait for another tour jeep. It may take hours, but...

469
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,270
Where are you going?

470
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,910
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals ! I'm too old to die.

471
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,040
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up !

472
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,430
Please ! We need to stay together.

473
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,590
Fine ! We'll go that way!

474
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,200
Does anyone want a hard candy?

475
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,590
-Easy now. -Watch your step.

476
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,990
And right here. Okay, are you ready?

477
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
This is where you always slept.

478
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,870
Oh , man !

479
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,640
-Was this mine? -Look at you . Look at him .

480
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,710
Oh , this thing . Look, look!

481
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,480
-I remember this ! -He remembers.

482
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,800
A little harder than ...

483
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,560
You never slept on the right end . You always slept on the bottom end .

484
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,440
Is that...

485
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,230
Is that my...

486
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,480
Is that me?

487
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,270
You had the cutest little paws.

488
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,840
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

489
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,870
You did that the day we lost you .

490
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,990
Wow. I was so young .

491
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,910
What happened to me?

492
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,520
It was all my fault. I turned my back and ...

493
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,510
It was not your fault.

494
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,830
Your father did everything he could . He tracked those hunters for weeks.

495
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,560
Far off the reserve.

496
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,680
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

497
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,310
Well ...

498
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,120
We thought they'd killed you .

499
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,680
But my son fought them off! Don't mess with the King of New York!

500
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,480
-That's right! -Keep your chin in .

501
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,710
You boys be careful ! Watch out before you break something .

502
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,280
You used to call this "foofie."

503
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,790
"Foofie"?

504
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,960
Foofie.

505
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,400
He doesn't want that.

506
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,120
This is my foofie !

507
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,200
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

508
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,480
I mean , no, thank you , thank you . It's perfect.

509
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Son , you get your rest. You have a big day tomorrow.

510
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,600
You'll need all your strength .

511
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,070
I will bring the house down for you .

512
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,390
I hope so. Otherwise, your father will have to banish you .

513
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,400
Jeez, Mom , really?

514
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,550
I know you'll do us proud . You know why?

515
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,430
You were born with it.

516
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,070
Good night, Alakay. My boy. My own boy.

517
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,750
My son's a king .

518
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,070
My son's a king .

519
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,630
Good night, Mom .

520
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,550
Good night, Alakay.

521
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,590
Foofie.

522
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,350
Look at foofie ! My foofie !

523
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,550
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie !

524
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,350
No sign of civilisation . Everybody appears very tired .

525
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,790
I think we're lost.

526
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,600
Nana, do you know where you're going?

527
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,200
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.

528
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,630
Sure, right, okay. Yeah , all right.

529
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,960
-It's people. -How did you get here?

530
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,840
-Can you help us? We're lost. -We're lost, too.

531
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,400
It was aul . A flash of black and white and they were gone. They took the jeep !

532
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,790
-That happened to our jeep, too ! -What do we do?

533
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,160
How will we all survive?

534
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,150
No food , no water, no shelter. What are we gonna do?

535
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,320
You can let nature get the best of you ,

536
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,040
or you can get the best of nature.

537
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,520
Gather 'round , children . We're New Yorkers, right?

538
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,800
Yeah .

539
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,200
We survive the concrete jungle !

540
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,920
When we need food , we hunt for a decent hot dog stand .

541
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,680
-Am I right? -She's right.

542
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,960
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.

543
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,200
-Exactly! -When we need water, we build a dam .

544
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud !

545
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,680
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere !

546
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,230
I'm coming , King J ulien !

547
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,280
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

548
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,120
No, shark, no ! Sit!

549
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,390
Why am I laughing?

550
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,320
We have all the parts we need , but we're slightly behind schedule.

551
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,560
-How slightly? -Six to nine years.

552
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,840
-Sixty-nine years? -No, six to nine years.

553
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

554
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,920
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

555
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,080
Darn you , Darwin !

556
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,100
Nobody goes A WOL on my watch. Private! You're coming with me.

557
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,950
Rico! You're coming with me!

558
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,350
-We'll bring them in for court martial . -That won't be necessary!

559
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,320
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you , Skipper.

560
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Well, I'II be a monkey's uncle.

561
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,430
Oh , I doubt that.

562
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,360
Enough Iollygagging. Let's get to work.

563
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,640
There'II be three groups. Group AIpha will do sheet metal fabrication.

564
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,680
Group Bronson handles assembly. Group George Peppard, craft services.

565
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,030
Any questions?

566
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,110
Good! Let's get to work.

567
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,230
I'd like to kiss you , monkey man .

568
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,320
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

569
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,120
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance

570
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,550
comes from the heart.

571
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,150
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong .

572
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,120
Sure, mister.

573
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,160
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.

574
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,800
-You're not nervous, are you? -Nah , it's my thing .

575
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,520
In my opinion , the key to this is choosing the right competitor.

576
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,760
You mean , this is like a dance battle sort of thing?

577
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,990
-Like a dance-off? -Sure.

578
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,840
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

579
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,670
Who'd be a good match for me? J ust to keep things interesting .

580
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,750
Well , I wish I could help,

581
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,320
but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred .

582
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,200
But if it was me out there, I'd choose Teetsi .

583
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,520
Teetsi . Okay. Sounds interesting .

584
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,120
Makunga, right? Thank you .

585
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,590
Anything for Zuba's boy. Go get 'em , tiger.

586
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,240
Shake it out.

587
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,830
A five, six, seven , eight.

588
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,200
Let's go, let's do this.

589
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,480
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.

590
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,920
-Come on , baby! Make Mama proud ! -Woman , I'm trying to take...

591
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,160
On it, Mom !

592
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,640
Who will be the first participant?

593
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,320
Me ! Oh ! Me, me, me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Me, me ! Please, me?

594
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,200
How about you? The tall , handsome one.

595
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,950
Yeah . Choose your opponent.

596
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,590
Let me see.

597
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,350
I guess I'll pick

598
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,830
Teetsi?

599
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,880
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

600
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,240
That's my boy! He's got some gumption there !

601
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,280
Somebody, wake him up !

602
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,480
All right, so, Teetsi , come on . Let's do this, huh?

603
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,100
Come on , little tsetse fly. Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

604
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,400
-Let's dance ! -Okay.

605
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,280
But let me warn you that I am a prot?g? of

606
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,950
Fosse and Robbins !

607
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,920
Not "dance" dance ! Fight!

608
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,720
Dance fight! You got it.

609
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,520
-Is he dancing? -What's he doing?

610
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,830
I know that boy is not dancing .

611
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,840
This is even better than I thought.

612
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,040
Alakay, turn around !

613
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,240
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish , turn around .

614
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,120
Oh , no.

615
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
Alakay! Are you hurt?

616
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,350
Yeah , I am .

617
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,640
Did I . . . Did I win?

618
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,040
No, son .

619
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,000
How could this happen?

620
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,910
You told us you were a king . A king does not get beat.

621
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,030
I am a king . I'm the King of New York.

622
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,640
It's my stage name. Like for when I perform .

623
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
Perform?

624
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,040
Oh , no, this is horrible ! Alakay has failed the test!

625
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,720
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish

626
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,120
his own son?

627
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,040
Zuba, no.

628
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,920
Zuba, yes.

629
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,190
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.

630
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,360
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion .

631
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,950
Dad , what are you doing?

632
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,190
Dad , no ! You can't do this.

633
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,070
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

634
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,270
Anyone?

635
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,550
Someone? No one?

636
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,680
You , sir!

637
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,390
I guess not.

638
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,480
Well , I . . . This is all very awkward ,

639
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,390
but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden .

640
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,200
Teetsi ! Get the hat.

641
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,240
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!

642
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,400
He shall wear this Hat of Shame

643
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,240
and leave the watering hole

644
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,750
for a thousand years, or life !

645
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,350
Whichever comes last.

646
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,280
Shoo, shoo ! Get out of here !

647
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,720
You should have told us you weren't a real king , son !

648
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,960
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!

649
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,310
What did you expect?

650
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,040
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son , it's a fight! "

651
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,720
-You're a lion ! -But I never fought another lion !

652
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,640
No, I guess not. You dance !

653
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,040
And other stuff! Your pal , Makunga, set me up back there !

654
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,840
-None of this would have happened . . . -If you were a real lion .

655
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,800
-Zuba ! -Yeah , I said it!

656
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,750
A real lion .

657
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,360
Thanks.

658
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,400
Thanks a lot.

659
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,390
Saw.

660
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,200
Suture.

661
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,350
Swab.

662
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,960
You're in my light, Stephen .

663
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,120
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

664
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,760
That's very observant, Stephen . As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

665
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,520
Okay! That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.

666
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,840
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?

667
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,360
No, you got your whole life ahead of you .

668
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,800
-Really? -Go out and grab it by the horns.

669
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,480
-Thank you , Dr Mankiewicz! -Break a leg ! Sweet kid .

670
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,720
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.

671
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,160
Witch Doctor's Disease?

672
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,080
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

673
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,040
-Don't ask. -Someone's been knotty.

674
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,160
This won't hurt a bit.

675
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,440
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.

676
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,070
-And? -Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

677
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,680
Wednesday, no Joe?

678
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,480
I can breathe ! Thanks, doc!

679
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,560
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?

680
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,160
You'll find a cure. You've got at least 48 hours !

681
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,230
But I've never heard of it.

682
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,880
I mean . . . I don't have any penicillin .

683
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,240
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started !

684
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,230
Have a lion look you over. They'd be happy to.

685
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,270
Ta-da !

686
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,960
-He has talent. -Stupendous and tremendous.

687
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,920
Hollah !

688
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,040
Bet you've never seen that one ! Knocked 'em dead in New York!

689
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,440
-Let's all give it a try! -Let's do it!

690
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,600
Well , you can try all you want to,

691
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
but it takes years of practice.

692
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,160
You'll never get a tight stream

693
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,600
until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can

694
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,070
purse your lips like this. You got it?

695
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,870
Ta-da !

696
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,880
How did you . . . You guys got it right out of the box!

697
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
-If you can do it. . . -. . .we can do it.

698
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,950
It's in our blood !

699
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,040
I always thought I was a bit unique.

700
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,360
We are unique !

701
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,560
We are like a force of nature !

702
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,320
-A million points of light! -And dark stripes !

703
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,470
Exactly the same !

704
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,150
Exactly the same.

705
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,280
Looks impressive, Kowalski , but will it fly?

706
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,800
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

707
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,190
N ice.

708
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,630
Oh , man . My dad thinks I'm a total loser.

709
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,680
I've ruined my parents' lives.

710
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,680
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

711
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,360
It is lackin' in the crackin', my friend . I've gotta fix this.

712
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,110
So...

713
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,360
There's. . . There's something I gotta tell you .

714
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,350
Hey, guys.

715
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,080
Is this place great or what?

716
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,240
I'd go with "or what."

717
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,920
Well , I'll tell you what. You're not gonna believe it, but

718
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,310
I got a date with Moto Moto.

719
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,040
Who's Moto Moto?

720
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,030
Oh , he's so big and handsome and big !

721
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,920
-Know what "Moto Moto" means? -Twins?

722
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,880
It means, "Hot Hot."

723
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,280
"Hot Hot"?

724
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,480
When did you start parlez-ing African?

725
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,760
It's in my blood .

726
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,240
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr Hot Pants after I'm gone.

727
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,200
Melman , why am I the parade and you're the rain?

728
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,400
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?

729
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,040
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town !

730
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,560
Whoa, guys.

731
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,280
Main Street's mine !

732
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,400
Well , you can have it!

733
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,680
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr Hotee Moto Moto...

734
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,120
-What are you talking about? -What are we talking about?

735
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,720
Melman , just tell her.

736
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,040
What? What are you . . . I don't know what you're talking about.

737
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,440
I guess I'll go, then .

738
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,400
Don't bother.

739
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,880
-Don't get up on my account. -Melman ! Gloria !

740
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,920
-I thought you guys were friends ! -Marty's absolutely right.

741
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
-Marty? -Marty?

742
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,800
Marty?

743
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,840
What the heck is going on?

744
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,760
You're not. . . Oh ! He was. . . I thought he. . . You're not him . He's. . . Oh .

745
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,400
You thought that guy was me?

746
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,000
No. I mean , yes, you . . . Guys, come on .

747
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,960
You thought I was him?

748
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,120
You guys kind of do look a little...

749
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,600
You look a lot alike. Marty, you look a lot alike.

750
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,000
You laugh alike. Talk alike. He has the same speech pattern .

751
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,440
It's a little weird , really. I mean , come on . Marty.

752
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,640
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.

753
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
I'm just like any other zebra.

754
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,430
No. Of course you're different!

755
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,960
How?

756
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,910
Okay, I can't tell you apart.

757
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,870
Maybe you could wear a bell or something .

758
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,640
-A bell? -Okay, not a bell . Bell's a bad idea.

759
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,880
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?

760
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,440
-I'm not stupid ! -Not you , stupid ! H im , stupid !

761
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,880
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,

762
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,160
I've been having the worst day of my life.

763
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,310
It's always about you , isn't it?

764
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,960
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.

765
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,790
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?

766
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,360
Yeah , fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

767
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,600
That's what you do best! J ust like back in New York!

768
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,670
I'm right here. But you can't tell that, right?

769
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,680
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy

770
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,670
your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone !

771
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,200
Good , leave ! I don't need you to help me solve my problems !

772
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,360
You're a dime a dozen ! I can't tell which one's Marty!

773
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,360
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute. Oh , yeah , I don't care !

774
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,030
N ice hat, you showoff!

775
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,120
Marty,

776
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,560
don't go.

777
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,520
Giddy-up, giddy-up !

778
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,000
Look, Maurice !

779
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,360
The perfect spot for my summer palace !

780
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,510
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.

781
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,600
-Who'd leave a perfectly good head? -What a waste.

782
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,950
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

783
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,710
I'm terminal , you know?

784
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,390
I probably only have another two days left to live.

785
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,920
That's a bummer, man .

786
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,590
If I , King J ulien , that's my name,

787
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,440
only had two days left to live,

788
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,040
I would do all the things

789
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,480
-I've ever dreamed of doing . -Like what?

790
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,760
I'd love to become a professional whistler.

791
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,040
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better,

792
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,030
make my living out of it.

793
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,520
You know what else I would do? I would invade a neighbouring country

794
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,480
and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!

795
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,800
Easy for you to say. You're a king .

796
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,790
Yes. And you are only just a sad little head .

797
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,960
There must be something you want to do before you die !

798
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,920
-There is this one thing . -What? Tell me.

799
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,120
-No, I couldn't. -What is it?

800
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,560
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.

801
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,480
What is it? Please tell me !

802
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,720
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

803
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,320
How I've always felt about her.

804
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,120
Fine. Don't tell me !

805
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,520
Is it a woman? You didn't tell me it's a woman .

806
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,720
What are you afraid of? You're a dead man anyway.

807
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,160
Yeah . Yeah . You're right.

808
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,520
You've got to march right up to this woman .

809
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,880
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward .

810
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,550
J ust a little, or almost all the way.

811
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're

812
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,400
just lips' distance away from each other.

813
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,440
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

814
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,680
Actually, it's more like love her.

815
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,800
Oh , you sly dog ! Woof, woof!

816
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,310
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

817
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,200
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

818
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,680
-He didn't hear you . -I can't hear you !

819
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,520
-You got to rise up ! -Rising up !

820
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,590
-Get out of the hole ! -I'm rising out of the ground !

821
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,520
-He's rising , Maurice. -I'm rising , Maurice !

822
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,710
-Rising ! -You go right up to this woman !

823
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,800
Do you feel it?

824
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,200
-Go up to her face ! -Tell the truth !

825
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,880
-I'm going to tell her! -Then you say, "Baby, I dig you ! "

826
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,590
Yeah ! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it!

827
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,040
I love that happy little head .

828
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,960
She Iove

829
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,400
Moto Moto

830
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,200
She Iove

831
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,440
Moto Moto

832
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,910
She Ioves me She Ioves my eyes

833
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,080
She Ioves me She Ioves my thighs

834
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,470
She Ioves my roundness

835
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,550
She Iove that I'm chunky She Iove that I'm plumpy

836
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,000
She Iove my heftiness She Iove my zestiness

837
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,830
She Iove me restlessly She Iove me forever

838
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,680
She Iove me

839
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,240
'cause she Iove me

840
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,080
Moto Moto,

841
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,790
before things get too serious, well ,

842
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,190
I was wondering , if I were to, for example, stay here,

843
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,760
I'd like to ask you ...

844
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,080
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my ear canal .

845
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,840
I have so many questions.

846
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,280
I promise the answer will always be yes.

847
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,280
U nless no is required .

848
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,510
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?

849
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,160
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.

850
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,120
Okay. Other than that.

851
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,920
Let's see.

852
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,910
Yeah , well , you know, you chunky.

853
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,280
Right.

854
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,630
My gosh , girl , you huge.

855
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,910
You said that.

856
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,960
Yeah , that's right.

857
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,790
We don't have to talk no more.

858
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,280
Gloria !

859
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,680
Gloria.

860
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,880
Melman .

861
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,350
Melman , I want you to meet Moto Moto.

862
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,990
Moto Moto. Yeah , nice to meet you .

863
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,040
-I guess I . . . -It's okay, Melman .

864
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,480
Apology accepted .

865
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,160
Oh . Yeah , right, that. That's why I . . . Good .

866
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,230
Okay. Well , that's it, then .

867
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Good . We're kind of busy here, man .

868
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,830
No. No, that's not it.

869
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,350
Listen , Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen .

870
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,240
Because you , my friend , you found yourself the perfect woman .

871
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,880
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman ,

872
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,760
I'd give her flowers every day. And not just any flowers. Okay?

873
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,720
Her favourites are orchids. White. And breakfast in bed .

874
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,200
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.

875
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,040
No crust, the way she likes it.

876
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,350
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend .

877
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,360
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh .

878
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,040
She has the most amazing laugh .

879
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,390
That's what I would do if I were you .

880
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,240
But I'm not, so you do it.

881
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,960
Okay.

882
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,390
What?

883
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,710
That was beautiful .

884
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,310
Anyways, where were we?

885
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,200
I'm "huge"?

886
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,880
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

887
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,120
Well , I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion !

888
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,430
Is this real enough for you? How about this? This is for setting me up !

889
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,390
This is for stealing my dad's job ! This is for humiliating my family!

890
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,960
And making me look like a fool !

891
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,760
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

892
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,560
Coward .

893
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,880
The water. It's gone.

894
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,080
It's never gone dry before.

895
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,040
-We'll need a lot more dying holes. -How could this happen?

896
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,320
Out of my way! What is going on here?

897
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,400
The watering hole is dry! There's barely water for one of us !

898
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,840
-Good observation , Shirley. -I'm Bobby.

899
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,400
Makunga, what do we do?

900
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,880
Quiet!

901
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,280
Listen up ! I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis,

902
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,720
we'll all have to fight for it.

903
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,280
-We can't fight for it. -That's crazy.

904
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,000
That's not fair. You'd win !

905
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,280
Exactly, Shirley.

906
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,600
I'm Bob...

907
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,600
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair. I'm in charge now,

908
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,680
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion .

909
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,360
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.

910
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,320
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.

911
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,830
-Off the reserve? -It's too dangerous !

912
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,200
H unters would shoot us !

913
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,160
No one leaves the reserve and survives !

914
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,960
I left the reserve !

915
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,190
And survived .

916
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,800
I can do something about this.

917
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,360
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

918
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,160
-U priver? -Off the reserve?

919
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,280
You?

920
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,600
Yeah . I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.

921
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,750
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

922
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,350
Fine. Go ahead , laugh . Laugh your mane off. I'll prove you wrong .

923
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,910
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.

924
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,160
Zuba would know what to do.

925
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,080
-Where's Zuba? -You don't care about us.

926
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,230
Zuba should be in charge, not you .

927
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,720
All right, fine !

928
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,760
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba !

929
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,200
Marty?

930
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,910
Hey! Marty!

931
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,710
Marty?

932
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,590
Marty.

933
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,720
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

934
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,870
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

935
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,400
H i . Is Marty in there?

936
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,550
Anyone seen Marty?

937
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,670
Which one of us is Marty?

938
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,750
All right. Well , if you see him ,

939
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,040
tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.

940
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,920
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

941
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,240
-Can we come? -No. I have to do this alone.

942
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,390
You can't leave the reserve !

943
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,880
What are you doing?

944
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,870
-They'll get your hat. -H unters are everywhere !

945
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,320
Could you leave the hat?

946
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,990
Marty! I know you're in there.

947
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,110
Before I go, I got something I want to say.

948
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,640
You've been a great friend .

949
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,160
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems

950
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,990
that I never think of you having any.

951
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,830
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.

952
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,230
J ust like back at the zoo.

953
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,600
What kind of friend does that make me? A pretty lousy friend , I guess.

954
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,870
I just want you to know that I ...

955
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,670
You're one in a million .

956
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,760
This is touching .

957
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,160
It is touching .

958
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,480
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?

959
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,990
That's right. Gotcha !

960
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,950
I see you in there ! Yeah , you .

961
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,880
You , right there.

962
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,190
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.

963
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,870
That's you , Marty.

964
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,870
I know it's you .

965
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,880
Know what makes you special?

966
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,560
These guys are white with black stripes. You're black with white stripes.

967
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,320
You're a dreamer, Marty.

968
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,270
Always have been . You have great taste in music

969
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,320
and horrible taste in friends.

970
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,520
Well , not Melman and Gloria, but me.

971
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,150
Okay, I'm in .

972
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,520
Marty, you can't come with me.

973
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,270
You don't have a choice.

974
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,950
-People are out there ! -You're crazy! Come back!

975
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,230
The people will get you !

976
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,440
Don't lose the hat!

977
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,280
Bye, hat!

978
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,430
Any water?

979
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,150
No, just more diamonds and gold .

980
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,760
Don't give up hope.

981
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Listen up ! I will help you !

982
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,910
There's only one way to get your precious water.

983
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,160
I , your beloved King J ulien

984
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,600
must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods,

985
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,430
in the volcano !

986
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,280
What does that do?

987
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,950
What does that do? Excellent question .

988
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,270
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

989
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,550
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

990
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,280
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

991
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,080
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough ."

992
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,280
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."

993
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,800
"I don't want another sacrifice ! "

994
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,080
"Look at you ! You're skinny! " "No ! I've had enough ! "

995
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,800
The gods eat the sacrifice. They are grateful .

996
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,710
They give me some water, and then I give it to you .

997
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,480
What?

998
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,600
Does it work?

999
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,280
No ! I mean , yes.

1000
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
Well , Maurice?

1001
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,100
Ah , it's 50-50.

1002
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,310
We'll do it!

1003
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Excellent!

1004
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,840
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano

1005
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,830
and get eaten by gods.

1006
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
Any hands ! Hands, anybody!

1007
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,550
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love,

1008
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,920
who could look death straight in the eyeball . A real , genuine hero.

1009
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,960
-I'll do it. -Melman?

1010
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,480
H urry up ! Before we all come to our senses !

1011
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,520
Melman , what is wrong with you?

1012
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.

1013
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,440
Are you nuts?

1014
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,720
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

1015
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,720
it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going .

1016
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,790
It was always you .

1017
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
Seeing you every day.

1018
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,630
That's what kept me going .

1019
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,270
Melman ! Wait!

1020
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,600
Melman ! Melman ! Melman !

1021
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,310
You going to mope like this all day?

1022
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,440
Don't "hmph" me.

1023
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,400
Listen , Zuba. A miracle happened .

1024
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,400
Our son came back to us. How come that is not good enough for you?

1025
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,550
What are you saying , woman?

1026
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,640
We lost him once, Zuba. Let's not lose him again .

1027
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,510
Zuba !

1028
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,100
-Zuba ! -Get out of here !

1029
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,920
What do you want?

1030
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,150
It's aul .

1031
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
The watering hole is dried up.

1032
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,600
Dried up? That's impossible !

1033
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,430
There's nothing left!

1034
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,440
You're alpha lion , Makunga. What are you gonna do about it?

1035
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,640
Your son , Alakay, he said he could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1036
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,360
-Off the reserve? -No !

1037
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
I tried to stop him . I told him it was suicide.

1038
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,990
He was determined to prove himself to you .

1039
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,680
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1040
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,030
H urry, Zuba !

1041
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm so parched .

1042
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,310
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1043
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,040
We'll slip in , find the problem . H unters will never know we were here.

1044
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
Why are we doing this?

1045
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
Maybe my dad will think I'm ...

1046
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,440
I want to show him I'm a real lion .

1047
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,760
As opposed to a chocolate lion .

1048
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,240
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.

1049
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,390
What?

1050
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,320
As far as my dad is concerned .

1051
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
As far as people are concerned , you're a hit.

1052
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
In New York. This is Africa. Much tougher crowd .

1053
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,350
Marty, this is it!

1054
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,790
This is the clog ! Come on .

1055
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,350
Well , there's the water.

1056
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,920
Stay down . Look at that.

1057
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,640
Knit one, purl two.

1058
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,680
It's her.

1059
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
-Is this right? -Very good .

1060
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,190
Nana, slow down .

1061
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,280
You're a little tangled , aren't you?

1062
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,640
No, don't pull . I'll do it.

1063
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
We need dynamite. Got any?

1064
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,400
Oh , snap ! I just used my last stick this morning !

1065
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,480
-Savages ! -Evasive manoeuvres !

1066
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,880
-Serpentine, serpentine ! -Squiggly squid manoeuvre !

1067
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,680
Zag , zig-zag , zig ziggy zag !

1068
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,560
No, no ! Squiggly squid !

1069
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,720
Etch A Sketch !

1070
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,710
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus !

1071
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,670
-Run , Marty! -I can't leave you here !

1072
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,880
Go get help ! Squiggly squid manoeuvre ! Go ! Go ! Squiggly squid !

1073
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,790
Etch A Sketch ! Etch A Sketch !

1074
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,400
Save us We Iove you

1075
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,750
Okay.

1076
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,830
Okay, okay, okay.

1077
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
-Save us -Melman

1078
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,320
-We Iove you -Melman

1079
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,440
Save us

1080
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, here we go. Okay, okay.

1081
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,640
-Melman -We Iove you

1082
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,400
-Melman -Save us

1083
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,070
Here we go ! Here we go !

1084
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,480
-What's all the hoopla about? -Joe?

1085
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,990
Joe the Witch Doctor? We thought you were dead !

1086
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,790
So did I . Then I realised I'm covered in brown spots.

1087
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,950
So, Melman's not dying !

1088
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,280
-Melman's not dying ! -Oh , no !

1089
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,430
Melman !

1090
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,160
Move !

1091
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,520
Don't do this ! J ulien , stop this ! This is crazy!

1092
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,960
Oh , suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1093
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,950
Yes !

1094
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,480
-Please, Melman ! Stop ! -Gloria?

1095
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,950
-You can't do this ! -Why not?

1096
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
Because...

1097
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,240
You can't do this, Melman .

1098
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,910
First, that hurts.

1099
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,560
Second , I've only got 1 8 hours to live, anyway.

1100
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,070
Melman , I gotta know,

1101
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,750
did you mean those things you said about me?

1102
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,310
Of course I did .

1103
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,710
-That's crazy. -It is?

1104
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,110
It's crazy to think I had to go haltway around the world

1105
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,870
to find out the perfect guy for me

1106
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,830
lived right next door.

1107
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,960
Then it's you and me, neighbour.

1108
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,080
You and me for the next 1 8 hours.

1109
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,230
I'll take whatever you got.

1110
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,790
-Maurice, what happened? -I believe the fat lady has sung .

1111
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
-What's going on here? -Marty!

1112
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
Alex is in big trouble ! We got to get upriver fast!

1113
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,150
-What about the plane? -Perfect! Come on !

1114
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,950
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.

1115
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,880
Now, maternity leave.

1116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,400
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1117
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,790
We need that plane for a rescue mission .

1118
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,560
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union .

1119
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,320
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going .

1120
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,680
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1121
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savannah .

1122
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,080
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1123
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,800
Finally.

1124
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,800
Where we headed? What's going on? Where are we going?

1125
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,480
Oh , no ! Please ! Don't put me there ! No !

1126
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,520
This is wrong .

1127
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,080
You see? You are survivors.

1128
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,870
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1129
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,280
You can't eat a lion .

1130
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,080
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken .

1131
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,390
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1132
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,360
She's out of her mind , people !

1133
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,430
I'm from New York City!

1134
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,590
It's me, Alex the Lion ! From Central Park!

1135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,550
Dad !

1136
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,750
What were you thinking , son? You got no business being out here !

1137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Stay behind me.

1138
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,840
They're New Yorkers. They're just rude and frightened people.

1139
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
Stay back!

1140
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,790
You'd let your dinner get away?

1141
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,470
-What are you doing? -The only thing I know how to do.

1142
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,670
What the heck?

1143
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Hey, I know those moves.

1144
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Alex?

1145
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,350
-It's Alex the Lion ! -From Central Park!

1146
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,750
It is Alex!

1147
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,520
Only one lion can move like that!

1148
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,360
He's beautiful .

1149
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,920
I can't believe it.

1150
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,630
How does he do that?

1151
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,800
What are you doing?

1152
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,470
I'm dancing with my son ! I think.

1153
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,350
Don't think, Dad . Feel !

1154
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,270
Butterfly!

1155
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,590
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1156
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,990
Roar!

1157
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,270
That was beautiful . Now let's eat!

1158
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,480
Dad , look out!

1159
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,440
What the...

1160
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,280
Alex! Get in !

1161
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,120
She's got a gun ! Get out while we can !

1162
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,040
-What? -She's got a gun !

1163
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,350
Get out while we can ! Pass it on !

1164
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,430
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam . Basset hound .

1165
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam .

1166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,830
-All right! But it's his funeral . -What?

1167
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,240
-Hard to port! -Aye-aye, Skippy!

1168
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,830
Bring it on ! Bring it on !

1169
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,960
Come back! That's my dinner!

1170
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,630
Kowalski , full throttle.

1171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,990
Music!

1172
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,080
-I like this song . -It never gets old .

1173
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,990
It does have a catchy hook. Come about! Bring her in low!

1174
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,430
Hold onto your skirts! It's dam-busting time!

1175
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,990
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go !

1176
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,680
Tell them no ! Pull up ! They'll kill us !

1177
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,670
There's got to be another way! Pass it on !

1178
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,160
They say no pull up. Kill us. There's no other way. Basset hound .

1179
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Are you sure?

1180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Men , there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.

1181
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
No ! Medic!

1182
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,320
Ramming speed !

1183
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,350
Bring it on !

1184
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,190
Bad kitties.

1185
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,550
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.

1186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,480
The science seemed so solid .

1187
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,480
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling .

1188
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
It's you ! I found you !

1189
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,230
Mort?

1190
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,030
Bad fishy!

1191
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,880
I wonder if the gods like seafood .

1192
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,550
Let's find out.

1193
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,950
Look, Maurice.

1194
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
-That was quick. -I did it!

1195
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,390
I did it! I did it!

1196
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,100
Okay, you did it!

1197
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,630
Oh , yes !

1198
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,270
Look!

1199
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,430
-It's Alakay! -It's Zuba !

1200
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,800
You did it!

1201
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,310
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1202
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,710
Zuba ! Alakay!

1203
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,070
You're back!

1204
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,390
I'm so glad you're safe !

1205
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,830
Out of my way.

1206
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,470
Well , well , well .

1207
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,550
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.

1208
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,510
And you were kicked out.

1209
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,760
So don't think that this changes anything .

1210
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,550
You're right. In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation .

1211
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,840
A man bag . Very popular where I'm from .

1212
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,480
-Don't know what to say. -Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1213
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,280
Does the strap adjust? This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking .

1214
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,100
But you're still banished .

1215
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,190
We figured you'd say that.

1216
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,430
My handbag !

1217
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,670
You bad kitty!

1218
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no !

1219
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,630
You deserve this, son .

1220
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,910
Welcome to the pride.

1221
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,280
Thanks, Dad . But this belongs to you .

1222
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,230
No, son . To us !

1223
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,590
My son ! The King of New York!

1224
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,270
That's my baby!

1225
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,100
Love transcends all differences.

1226
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,640
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.

1227
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,910
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?

1228
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
For better, please.

1229
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,510
What a beautiful , weird couple !

1230
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,830
That's not going to last.

1231
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,920
Can I kiss the bride?

1232
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,510
No ! Music!

1233
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
-Struts. -Check.

1234
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,600
-Flaps ! -Check.

1235
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,670
-Diamonds and gold . -Check.

1236
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,960
-Bye-bye ! -We'll miss you !

1237
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,240
See you later!

1238
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,150
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo,

1239
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,680
or whenever the gold runs out.

1240
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,720
Come back soon !

1241
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Mom , let them take their time. New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1242
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,280
You're right about that!

1243
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,600
As long as I'm with her

1244
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,390
and you two, I don't care where we are.

1245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,670
She has the most amazing laugh .

1246
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,520
Love has no boundaries !

1247
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,750
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.

1248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
Dad? What's wrong?

1249
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,990
I just thought we could hang out a bit and ...

1250
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,840
-You got me ! -I got you , son !

1251
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,200
You got me with my thing . You brought it back around on me.

1252
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,030
I got you , son !

1253
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,880
The old man's not too bad , eh , Marty?

1254
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,240
-Marty? Who's Marty? -Come on .

1255
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,840
-I don't know no Marty. -You can't fool me.

1256
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Ain't no Marty here.

1257
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,360
Marty! I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you .

1258
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,680
See, I've been travelling Been travelling forever

1259
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,080
But now that I found a home feels Iike I'm in heaven

1260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,320
See, I've been travelling Been travelling forever

1261
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,400
