1
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:30,024
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

2
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:52,206
No, no, son. Over here.

3
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:55,614
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

4
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:02,121
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

5
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:05,560
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

6
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:07,228
Da-da.

7
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,900
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

8
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:14,398
You see this mark?

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,901
You and me are the same.

10
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:20,473
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

11
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,308
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

12
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:26,080
No, Alakay. No dancing!

13
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,019
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

14
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:33,854
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

15
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,189
Now, come on, let's try it again.

16
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,161
No, Alakay.

17
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,697
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

18
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:44,201
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

19
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:47,670
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

20
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:52,142
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

21
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,338
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

22
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:00,714
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

23
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,379
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

24
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

25
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,123
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

26
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:13,462
We fight on three. One...

27
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:17,632
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

28
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:19,300
Two, three!

29
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,258
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

30
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,324
Don't you forget it.

31
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:49,499
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

32
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:51,961
Alakay?

33
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,834
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,741
This one's a beauty.

35
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,074
He'll be worth a few bucks.

36
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,346
Itjust gets easier and easier.

37
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:12,618
Daddy!

38
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,682
Alakay! Alakay!

39
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:17,093
Alakay!

40
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,690
Da-da!

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,191
No! No! No!

42
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:28,363
Alakay!

43
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:42,110
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

44
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,549
Da-da!

45
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,232
Alakay!

46
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,748
Daddy!

47
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:57,620
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

48
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:30,825
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

49
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,090
He's kind of a showoff.

50
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,496
You think he's cute?

51
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,843
Roar!!

52
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,511
The King of New York City...

53
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,685
...Alex the Lion!

54
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,917
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

55
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,056
The guy's an animal.

56
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:06,119
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

57
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,188
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

58
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:11,799
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

59
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:16,063
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

60
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,234
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

61
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,541
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

62
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,714
He was a very bad kitty.

63
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,746
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

64
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,084
to have the animals sent to Africa,

65
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:34,488
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

66
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,151
was reported missing today.

67
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:40,323
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

68
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,992
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

69
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:47,026
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

70
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:40,881
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

71
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:46,152
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

72
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,630
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

73
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,794
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

74
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,466
Seriously though, call. OK?

75
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:59,572
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

76
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:01,668
You can't leave without this!

77
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:04,040
Surprise, freaks!

78
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,807
Shake it! Shake it.

79
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:10,713
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

80
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:15,153
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

81
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:19,395
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

82
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,494
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

83
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,163
Oh, no, thank you.

84
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,509
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

85
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:38,509
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

86
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,683
...Stevie will be in charge!

87
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,519
I don't think they like that idea.

88
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,851
What are you saying, Stevie?

89
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,788
No.

90
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:58,302
Could we? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

91
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:02,237
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

92
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:04,307
Let them eat cake!

93
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,310
King Julien, wait for me!

94
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:10,643
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

95
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,711
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

96
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,953
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

97
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,046
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

98
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,053
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

99
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:27,595
- Struts.
- Check.

100
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:28,754
- Flaps.
- Check.

101
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,423
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

102
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,563
You guys!

103
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,069
Oopsie-daisy!

104
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:42,076
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

105
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,574
But it'll have to do. Attention.

106
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,249
This is your captain speaking.

107
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:49,476
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

108
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,415
then kiss your... good-bye.

109
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,688
New York City, here we come!

110
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,488
Pray to your personal God
this hunk of junk flies.

111
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,695
Personal God, hunk? What?

112
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:01,087
We are go, sir.

113
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,266
Open the door! I'm outside!

114
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:06,263
If cabin pressure is lost,

115
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:10,031
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

116
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:14,267
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

117
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,777
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

118
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:19,413
Launch!

119
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:20,610
- Launch!
- Launch!

120
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:02,986
Gremlin!

121
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:07,828
Hey, Mort.

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,092
Hi!

123
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,227
That was weird.

124
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,567
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

125
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,674
You got Madagascar on the brain.

126
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:22,277
I know I'm gonna miss it.

127
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:26,715
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

128
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,445
Like when you bit me on the butt?

129
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,956
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

130
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:36,790
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

131
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,690
Are the butts next to the croutons?

132
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,962
You don't need to be sarcastic.

133
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:47,471
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

134
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,596
Breeding program?

135
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,801
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

136
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,310
Settle down, have a relationship.

137
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:55,504
I can see that.

138
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,845
What? Like dating?

139
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,474
Yeah, dating.

140
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:03,076
Other... other guys?

141
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:06,383
What do you mean, other guys?

142
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:11,225
Darn it!

143
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:15,388
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

144
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,564
I'm gonna go check.

145
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:21,095
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

146
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:23,072
It's so funny!

147
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:28,110
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

148
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,407
To laugh!

149
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:36,242
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

150
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,121
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

151
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,558
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

152
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:46,358
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

153
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,126
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

154
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,327
We were checking on our drink order.

155
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,593
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

156
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,236
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

157
00:12:56,374 --> 00:13:00,811
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

158
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:04,074
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

159
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,948
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

160
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,452
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

161
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,020
Skipper, look.

162
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:14,818
Analysis.

163
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:19,056
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

164
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,325
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

165
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,388
That too, sir.

166
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,797
Right! Rico?

167
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:25,024
Manual!

168
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,897
Problemo solved.

169
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,305
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

170
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,042
We've lost engine one...

171
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,806
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

172
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,640
Buckle up, boys.

173
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,243
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

174
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:43,817
Attention! This is your captain.

175
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:47,582
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

176
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,817
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

177
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:56,763
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

178
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,825
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

179
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:14,682
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

180
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:19,353
I can fly!

181
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:24,287
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

182
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:27,422
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

183
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:31,065
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

184
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,932
I broke your iPod!

185
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,699
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

186
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:38,037
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

187
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,970
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

188
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,769
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

189
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:44,879
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

190
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:57,050
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

191
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:10,730
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

192
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,736
Rico, you've had your fun.

193
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,068
Pull up.

194
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,669
Gear down.

195
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,815
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

196
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,748
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

197
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:27,880
I said, kiss it!

198
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,032
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

199
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,767
I believe that's checkmate.

200
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,435
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

201
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,494
Oh, we're here.

202
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,326
What in the world?

203
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,105
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

204
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,606
I'm OK. I'm alive.

205
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:21,702
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

206
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,804
Kowalski, casualty report.

207
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,848
Two passengers unaccounted for.

208
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,846
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

209
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,519
Who says a penguin can't fly?

210
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:36,586
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

211
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:39,295
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

212
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:42,196
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

213
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:46,230
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

214
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:49,238
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

215
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,036
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

216
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:56,372
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

217
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,138
How do you estimate that?

218
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:01,783
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

219
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:05,014
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

220
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:09,492
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

221
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,926
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

222
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:14,055
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

223
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,993
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

224
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,728
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

225
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:21,635
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

226
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:25,573
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

227
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:27,976
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

228
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,071
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

229
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:35,078
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

230
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:38,855
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

231
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,915
You know, grit and spit and spit.

232
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:44,859
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

233
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,193
That don't sound too promising.

234
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:49,789
You're right. We're stuck here.

235
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:53,860
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

236
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:57,203
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

237
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,606
Behold! The lion!

238
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,304
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

239
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,780
Wait, wait, wait! People!

240
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:08,615
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

241
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:11,444
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

242
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,118
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

243
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,723
I know you!

244
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:18,853
You.

245
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,954
It's the bad kitty.

246
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:30,965
How do you like some of that?!

247
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:52,155
Come in, Tokyo!

248
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,334
Right in the batteries.

249
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:03,266
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

250
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:06,609
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

251
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,072
Thank you, dear.

252
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,677
Moving on!

253
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,184
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

254
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:19,412
Out of my mind?

255
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,348
Who's out of my mind now?

256
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,792
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

257
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:28,195
Out of my mind. We're going home.

258
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,870
Message E-4.

259
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:44,774
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

260
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,381
Please try again later.

261
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,387
Am I trippin'?

262
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,891
All those zebras... like me.

263
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,557
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

264
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,230
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

265
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,899
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

266
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,125
Africa?

267
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,735
It's got to be.

268
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,564
Our ancestral crib.

269
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,004
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

270
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,735
No, it's more than that. It's like...

271
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:19,914
...deja vu, like I've been here before.

272
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,742
It's like Roots!

273
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,486
No, it's like...

274
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:26,917
...deja vu, like I've been here before.

275
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:38,928
Me Alex!

276
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:42,432
Me and me friends fly,

277
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,765
fly in great metal bird.

278
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:49,438
Then plummet!

279
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:51,778
Smash ground!

280
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,279
Go boom!

281
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,611
Then here we emerge.

282
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,982
We offer only happiness

283
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,720
and good greetings.

284
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,123
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

285
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:09,629
Yeah. We just... yeah.

286
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,628
I thought... Sorry.

287
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,863
You came from off the reserve?

288
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:16,971
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

289
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:26,305
Don't strain yourself.

290
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,745
What's going on here?

291
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:31,583
They say they're from off the reserve.

292
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:35,022
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

293
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,253
You look familiar. Do I know you?

294
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:39,852
How could you survive the hunters?

295
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,262
We didn't see any hunters.

296
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:44,197
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

297
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:47,431
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

298
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:50,003
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

299
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,435
Is there a manager we could talk to?

300
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,577
I see. You're here to challenge me!

301
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:57,336
What? No! No.

302
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:59,242
That's what it looks like to me!

303
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,847
Zuba! Wait.

304
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,847
I'm trying to take care of business...

305
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,582
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

306
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:07,587
Alakay?

307
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:09,689
Is that you?

308
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:13,260
No, it's Alex. Lx. Like New York Knicks.

309
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,623
Zuba, look!

310
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,691
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

311
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,027
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

312
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:22,799
A mark.

313
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:26,369
All right, this is a little weird.

314
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,538
Honey, he's come home.

315
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,574
What?

316
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:33,546
You've come home.

317
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:42,950
Son.

318
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,222
Dad.

319
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:55,337
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

320
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,738
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

321
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:01,304
I got a mom and dad!

322
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:02,909
My baby's alive!

323
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,511
Dad!

324
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,409
My son!

325
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,746
My son is home!

326
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,749
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

327
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:23,259
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

328
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,760
I thought you hated Zuba.

329
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,536
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

330
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,132
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

331
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,771
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

332
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:38,606
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

333
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:41,549
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

334
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:43,279
New York!

335
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,556
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

336
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:50,889
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

337
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:53,225
This calls for a celebration!

338
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:55,162
Maurice, I think they like me.

339
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,792
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

340
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:11,707
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

341
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:14,243
Hey, Marty!

342
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,720
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

343
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,492
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

344
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:26,261
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

345
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,356
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

346
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,867
What? You don't have doctors here?

347
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,425
Not anymore.

348
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,994
Well, what if you catch a cold?

349
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:39,167
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

350
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:43,909
You guys really need a doctor.

351
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,178
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

352
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,741
Me? A doctor?

353
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,022
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

354
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:01,121
Why dont you have a man? You got worms?

355
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:03,722
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

356
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:06,895
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

357
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,098
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

358
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:14,109
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

359
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:18,911
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

360
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:21,644
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

361
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:23,577
Roar!

362
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:27,714
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

363
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:32,660
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

364
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,164
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

365
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:41,602
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

366
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:45,004
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

367
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,141
How do I look?

368
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:53,406
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

369
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:56,083
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

370
00:25:56,586 --> 00:25:58,816
Voila! He's a witch doctor!

371
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,488
My mother will be so happy.

372
00:26:05,362 --> 00:26:09,492
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

373
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:13,266
Here he comes.

374
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:33,954
Goodness, girl... you huge.

375
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,284
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

376
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,718
You as quick as you are hefty.

377
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:42,363
So you're Moto Moto?

378
00:26:42,432 --> 00:26:44,627
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

379
00:26:44,868 --> 00:26:46,529
I kind of like it, fatso.

380
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:50,801
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

381
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,550
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

382
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,086
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

383
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:11,590
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

384
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:14,289
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

385
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:16,457
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

386
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:21,937
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

387
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,303
I forgot about the rite of passage.

388
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:26,638
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

389
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,235
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

390
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:33,040
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

391
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:36,847
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

392
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,048
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

393
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:43,957
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

394
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:45,790
I want to be Alaki.

395
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:48,194
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

396
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,859
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

397
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,630
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

398
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:55,967
Where Im from, we say, "Break a leg."

399
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,200
That's my boy!

400
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,563
Beautiful, isn't it?

401
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,625
It's amazing.

402
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:28,835
Guys...

403
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,564
...this is where we belong.

404
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,642
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

405
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,777
Oh, I like that one.

406
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,576
It works on many levels.

407
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:41,446
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

408
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:43,008
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

409
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:44,917
Stations.

410
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:46,979
Stage one. Go!

411
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:03,529
Oh, no! What have I done?

412
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:05,104
Come on, take the bait.

413
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:07,803
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

414
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:09,435
Is it dead?

415
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,673
Stage two! Go, go, go!

416
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:22,885
I will give him the kiss of life.

417
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:25,550
Rico!

418
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,594
Rico!

419
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:34,167
Reverse!

420
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:35,226
Gas!

421
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,567
Music!

422
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,966
No! Stop! Stop!

423
00:29:41,578 --> 00:29:42,909
Stop!

424
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,477
Come back!

425
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,245
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

426
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:56,589
Is she dead?

427
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,383
No!

428
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,403
You hoodlums!

429
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,272
Good heavens! Are you OK?

430
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:15,539
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

431
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:19,343
My handbag. Such a good boy.

432
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,611
Nana can't survive without it.

433
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,842
You are one tough cookie.

434
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:26,920
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

435
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,790
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

436
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,455
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...

437
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:35,623
Where are you going?

438
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:41,095
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

439
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:45,966
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

440
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,776
Please! We need to stay...

441
00:30:49,312 --> 00:30:50,643
...together.

442
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:53,772
Fine! We'll go that way!

443
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:56,449
Does anyone want a hard candy?

444
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:02,652
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

445
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:07,126
And right here... OK, are you ready?

446
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:11,396
This is where you always slept.

447
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,129
Oh, man!

448
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:20,464
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

449
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:23,906
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

450
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:26,813
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

451
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:28,806
A little harder than...

452
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:32,816
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

453
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,816
Is that?

454
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:36,489
Is that my?

455
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:39,826
Is that me?

456
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:42,593
You had the cutest little paws.

457
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:45,164
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

458
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:48,164
You did that the day we lost you.

459
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:52,168
Wow. I was so young.

460
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:54,207
What happened to me?

461
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:58,705
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

462
00:31:58,782 --> 00:32:00,773
It was not your fault.

463
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:06,044
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

464
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:07,720
Far off the reserve.

465
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:11,051
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

466
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:12,517
...well...

467
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:16,195
We thought they'd killed you.

468
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:20,867
But my son fought them off!
Dont mess with the King of New York!

469
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,627
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

470
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:27,070
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

471
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:31,343
You used to call this "foofie."

472
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:32,904
"Foofie"?

473
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,149
Foofie.

474
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,742
He doesn't want that.

475
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,412
This is my foofie!

476
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,416
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

477
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:47,759
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

478
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:51,430
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

479
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,929
You'll need all your strength.

480
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:56,437
I will bring the house down for you.

481
00:32:56,906 --> 00:33:00,501
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

482
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,577
Jeez, Mom, really?

483
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,838
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

484
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,782
You were born with it.

485
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,778
Good night, Alakay.

486
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:15,784
My boy. My own boy.

487
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:20,126
My son's a king.

488
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:23,129
My son's a king.

489
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,800
Good night, Mom.

490
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,803
Good night, Alakay.

491
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:45,954
Foofie.

492
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:48,821
Look at foofie! My foofie!

493
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,054
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

494
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,631
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

495
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,959
I think we're lost.

496
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:03,831
Nana, do you know where you're going?

497
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:08,571
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

498
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,977
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

499
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:16,183
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

500
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,914
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

501
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:23,652
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

502
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:26,490
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?

503
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,928
How will we all survive?

504
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:31,990
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

505
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,938
You can let nature
get the best of you,

506
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:39,440
or you can get the best of nature.

507
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,745
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

508
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:47,077
Yeah.

509
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,608
We survive the concrete jungle!

510
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:54,123
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

511
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,851
- Am I right?
- She's right.

512
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:59,361
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

513
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:03,922
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

514
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,162
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

515
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:08,635
If we can make it there,

516
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:11,230
we can make it anywhere!

517
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:29,584
I'm coming, King Julien!

518
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,431
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

519
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:42,435
No, shark, no! Sit!

520
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:46,605
Why am I laughing?

521
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:54,548
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

522
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:56,983
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

523
00:35:57,053 --> 00:36:00,284
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

524
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:03,089
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

525
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,218
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

526
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:07,125
Darn you, Darwin!

527
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:12,133
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

528
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,134
Rico! You're coming with me!

529
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:19,798
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

530
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:23,471
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

531
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,817
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

532
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,986
Oh, I doubt that.

533
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,657
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

534
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:46,767
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

535
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:51,067
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

536
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,505
Any questions?

537
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:55,333
Good! Let's get to work.

538
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:05,518
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

539
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:09,347
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

540
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:19,934
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

541
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,361
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

542
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,300
Sure, mister.

543
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:30,402
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

544
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,972
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

545
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,816
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

546
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:41,152
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

547
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:43,283
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

548
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,720
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

549
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:49,896
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

550
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,894
Well, I wish I could help,

551
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:56,730
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

552
00:37:56,973 --> 00:38:00,500
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

553
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:04,680
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

554
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:06,237
Makunga, right? Thank you.

555
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,984
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

556
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:10,583
Shake it out.

557
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,085
A five, six, seven, eight.

558
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,754
Let's go, let's do this.

559
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,601
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

560
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:40,012
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

561
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:41,276
On it, Mom!

562
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,113
Who will be the first participant?

563
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:45,780
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

564
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,454
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

565
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:50,454
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

566
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:52,788
Let me see.

567
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:56,454
I guess I'll pick...

568
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:00,558
...Teetsi?

569
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:05,040
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

570
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:08,641
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

571
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:11,309
Somebody, wake him up!

572
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,760
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

573
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,324
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

574
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:34,570
- Let's dance!
- OK.

575
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:37,401
But let me warn you
that I am a protege of...

576
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:40,335
...Fosse and Robbins!

577
00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:43,167
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

578
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:46,345
Dance fight! You got it.

579
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:54,954
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

580
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:57,356
I know that boy is not dancing.

581
00:39:58,027 --> 00:40:00,188
This is even better than I thought.

582
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:04,522
Alakay, turn around!

583
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:08,965
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

584
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:20,375
Oh, no.

585
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,711
Alakay! Are you hurt?

586
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:25,714
Yeah, I am.

587
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,785
Did I... did I win?

588
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,188
No, son.

589
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,317
How could this happen?

590
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:35,455
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

591
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:39,558
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

592
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:44,028
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

593
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,266
Perform?

594
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:49,675
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

595
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:54,910
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

596
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:57,176
...his own son?

597
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:59,312
Zuba, no.

598
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:01,287
Zuba, yes.

599
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,424
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

600
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:20,507
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

601
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,271
Dad, what are you doing?

602
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:26,445
Dad, no! You can't do this.

603
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:31,186
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

604
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:33,448
Anyone?

605
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:35,620
Someone? No one?

606
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:38,049
You, sir!

607
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:39,719
I guess not.

608
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:42,787
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

609
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:46,624
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

610
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,636
Teetsi! Get the hat.

611
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:56,142
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

612
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,470
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

613
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:01,478
...and leave the watering hole

614
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:04,308
for a thousand years, or life!

615
00:42:05,654 --> 00:42:07,315
Whichever comes last.

616
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:13,161
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

617
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:17,660
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

618
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,300
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

619
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,666
What did you expect?!

620
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:26,299
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

621
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:29,173
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

622
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:31,145
No, I guess not. You dance!

623
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:35,274
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

624
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,115
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

625
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:39,916
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

626
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,351
A real lion.

627
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,691
Thanks.

628
00:42:49,031 --> 00:42:50,521
Thanks a lot.

629
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:01,704
Saw.

630
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:04,376
Suture.

631
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:07,546
Swab.

632
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:09,148
You're in my light, Stephen.

633
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,047
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

634
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:16,816
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

635
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,551
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

636
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,957
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

637
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:25,497
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

638
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:28,002
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

639
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,733
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

640
00:43:31,974 --> 00:43:34,841
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

641
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:40,246
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

642
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,415
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

643
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:46,176
This won't hurt a bit.

644
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:50,688
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spotjust like that.

645
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:54,923
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

646
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:56,995
Wednesday, no Joe?

647
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:59,531
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

648
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:03,670
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

649
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:07,533
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

650
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,703
But I've never heard of it.

651
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:13,043
I mean... I dont have any penicillin.

652
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:15,549
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

653
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:18,951
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

654
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:30,654
Ta-da!!

655
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:33,560
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

656
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:39,401
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

657
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:41,466
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

658
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,210
Well, you can try all you want to,

659
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,305
but it takes years of practice.

660
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:48,407
You'll never get a tight stream

661
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:52,944
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

662
00:44:53,022 --> 00:44:55,183
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

663
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:10,164
Ta-da!

664
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:17,240
How did you? You guys got it
right out of the box!

665
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:19,110
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

666
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:20,409
It's in our blood!

667
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:23,413
I always thought I was a bit unique.

668
00:45:23,485 --> 00:45:24,679
We are unique!

669
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:26,751
We are like a force of nature!

670
00:45:27,022 --> 00:45:29,684
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

671
00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:31,953
Exactly the same!

672
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:35,352
Exactly the same.

673
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:40,360
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

674
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:44,195
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

675
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,364
Nice.

676
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:03,881
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

677
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:05,889
I've ruined my parents' lives.

678
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:08,062
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

679
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,794
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

680
00:46:13,068 --> 00:46:14,228
So...

681
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:18,729
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

682
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:19,896
Hey, guys.

683
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:22,809
Is this place great or what?!

684
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:24,840
I'd go with "or what."

685
00:46:24,913 --> 00:46:28,576
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

686
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:31,575
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

687
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:33,911
Who's Moto Moto?

688
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:37,584
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

689
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:40,258
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

690
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:42,259
It means, "Hot Hot."

691
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:43,556
"Hot Hot"?

692
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,428
When did you start parlez-ing African?

693
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:47,691
It's in my blood.

694
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:51,565
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

695
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,507
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

696
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:56,737
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

697
00:46:56,812 --> 00:46:59,508
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

698
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:00,980
Whoa, guys.

699
00:47:01,183 --> 00:47:02,673
Main Street's mine!

700
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:04,912
Well, you can have it!

701
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:09,117
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

702
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,382
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

703
00:47:11,627 --> 00:47:12,958
Melman, just tell her.

704
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:16,958
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

705
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,598
I guess I'll go, then.

706
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,066
Don't bother.

707
00:47:20,135 --> 00:47:23,730
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

708
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:28,140
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

709
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,973
- Marty?
- Marty?

710
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:31,203
Marty?

711
00:47:32,147 --> 00:47:33,808
What the heck is going on?

712
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:39,077
You're not? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

713
00:47:39,154 --> 00:47:41,918
You thought that guy...

714
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,252
...was me?

715
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:46,089
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

716
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:48,322
You thought I was him?

717
00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:50,655
You guys kind of do look a little...

718
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:53,395
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

719
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:57,337
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

720
00:47:57,406 --> 00:48:00,466
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

721
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:03,704
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

722
00:48:03,912 --> 00:48:06,005
I'm just like any other zebra.

723
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:07,673
No. Of course you're different!

724
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,347
How?

725
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:13,180
OK, I can't tell you apart.

726
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:16,320
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

727
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:19,020
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

728
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,023
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

729
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:24,789
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

730
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:28,366
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

731
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:31,869
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

732
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:35,540
It's always about you, isn't it?

733
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:39,143
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

734
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:42,047
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

735
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:45,380
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

736
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:48,715
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

737
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:52,222
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

738
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:57,761
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

739
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,666
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

740
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:04,364
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

741
00:49:04,406 --> 00:49:07,569
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

742
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:10,669
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

743
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:13,408
Nice hat, you showoff!

744
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:20,252
Marty...

745
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,746
...don't go.

746
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:23,459
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

747
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:24,756
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

748
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:29,094
Look, Maurice!

749
00:49:29,331 --> 00:49:31,663
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

750
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:35,768
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

751
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:40,103
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

752
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:43,434
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

753
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:46,009
I'm terminal, you know?

754
00:49:47,015 --> 00:49:50,542
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

755
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:52,947
That's a bummer, man.

756
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:55,950
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

757
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,452
...only had two days left to live,

758
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:00,227
I would do all the things

759
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:02,786
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

760
00:50:02,865 --> 00:50:05,891
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

761
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:10,234
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

762
00:50:10,305 --> 00:50:12,296
make my living out of it.

763
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:25,916
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

764
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:29,924
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

765
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:31,926
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

766
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,153
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

767
00:50:36,398 --> 00:50:40,266
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

768
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:44,271
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

769
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:47,331
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

770
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:50,003
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

771
00:50:50,078 --> 00:50:51,943
What is it? Please tell me!

772
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:55,780
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

773
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,443
How I've always felt about her.

774
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,350
Fine. Don't tell me!

775
00:51:00,522 --> 00:51:04,618
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

776
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:09,027
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

777
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:11,298
Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:13,300
You're right.

779
00:51:13,368 --> 00:51:16,633
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

780
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:20,038
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

781
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,866
Just a little, or almost all the way.

782
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:27,147
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

783
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:30,651
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

784
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,382
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

785
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:38,955
Actually, it's more like love her.

786
00:51:39,027 --> 00:51:41,894
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

787
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,563
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

788
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:48,463
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

789
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:50,136
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

790
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:53,240
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

791
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:56,801
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

792
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:58,910
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

793
00:51:59,147 --> 00:52:01,911
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

794
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:03,807
Do you feel it?

795
00:52:04,252 --> 00:52:06,584
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

796
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:11,825
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

797
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:15,086
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

798
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,694
I love that happy little head.

799
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:21,829
Moto Moto

800
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:25,603
Moto Moto

801
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:29,277
She loves me
She loves my eyes

802
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:33,278
She loves me
She loves my thighs

803
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:35,446
She loves my roundness

804
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:39,618
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

805
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:43,789
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

806
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:47,960
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

807
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:49,991
She love me...

808
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:51,724
...'cause she love me

809
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:53,298
Moto Moto...

810
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:56,965
...before things get too serious, well,

811
00:52:57,305 --> 00:53:01,298
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

812
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:02,974
...I'd like to ask you...

813
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:07,645
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

814
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:10,081
I have so many questions.

815
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:13,754
I promise the answer will always be yes.

816
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:16,484
Unless no is required.

817
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:20,824
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

818
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:24,430
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

819
00:53:24,499 --> 00:53:26,433
OK. Other than that.

820
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:28,162
Let's see.

821
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:31,228
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

822
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:33,505
Right.

823
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,842
My gosh, girl, you huge.

824
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:39,102
You said that.

825
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:41,338
Yeah, that's right.

826
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:44,015
We don't have to talk no more.

827
00:53:44,252 --> 00:53:45,446
Gloria!

828
00:53:46,688 --> 00:53:47,780
Gloria.

829
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:49,183
Melman.

830
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:55,026
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

831
00:53:56,031 --> 00:54:00,195
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

832
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:04,164
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

833
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,763
Apology accepted.

834
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:10,540
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

835
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:14,014
OK. Well, that's it, then.

836
00:54:14,082 --> 00:54:17,210
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

837
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:20,043
No. No, that's not it.

838
00:54:21,556 --> 00:54:24,548
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

839
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,393
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

840
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:31,155
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

841
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:34,999
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers. OK?

842
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:39,006
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

843
00:54:39,074 --> 00:54:41,440
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

844
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,171
No crust, the way she likes it.

845
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:46,744
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

846
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:50,509
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

847
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:54,248
She has the most amazing laugh.

848
00:54:57,592 --> 00:55:00,584
That's what I would do if I were you.

849
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:03,261
But I'm not, so you do it.

850
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,260
OK.

851
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,600
What?

852
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:12,104
That was beautiful.

853
00:55:12,774 --> 00:55:15,607
Anyways, where were we?

854
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:17,442
I'm "huge"?

855
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:20,908
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

856
00:55:20,982 --> 00:55:24,213
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

857
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:28,620
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

858
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,683
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

859
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,229
And making me look like a fool!

860
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:54,976
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

861
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:56,648
Coward.

862
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:10,161
The water. It's gone.

863
00:56:10,498 --> 00:56:12,329
It's never gone dry before.

864
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,267
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

865
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:18,602
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

866
00:56:18,673 --> 00:56:21,540
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

867
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,942
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

868
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:25,502
Makunga, what do we do?

869
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,070
Quiet!

870
00:56:27,515 --> 00:56:32,509
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

871
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:35,250
We'll all have to fight for it.

872
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:37,848
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

873
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:40,851
That's not fair. You'd win!

874
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:42,360
Exactly, Shirley.

875
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,519
I'm Bob...

876
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,432
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

877
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:50,694
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

878
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:54,499
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

879
00:56:54,576 --> 00:56:58,535
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

880
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,144
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

881
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:02,682
Hunters would shoot us!

882
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,651
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

883
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,550
I left the reserve!

884
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,716
And survived.

885
00:57:10,058 --> 00:57:11,992
I can do something about this.

886
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:16,394
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

887
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:18,591
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

888
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:19,793
You?

889
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:23,863
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

890
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:29,070
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

891
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:34,742
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

892
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,910
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

893
00:57:43,825 --> 00:57:45,156
Zuba would know what to do.

894
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:47,258
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

895
00:57:47,495 --> 00:57:49,588
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

896
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:55,827
All right, fine!

897
00:57:56,104 --> 00:57:59,596
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

898
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:07,445
Marty?

899
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,289
Hey! Marty!

900
00:58:23,131 --> 00:58:24,621
Marty?

901
00:58:27,469 --> 00:58:29,061
Marty.

902
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:30,796
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

903
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:33,300
Excuse me! Excuse me!

904
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:36,633
Hi. Is Marty in there?

905
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:39,473
Anyone seen Marty?

906
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,650
Which one of us is Marty?

907
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:46,814
All right. Well, if you see him,

908
00:58:46,888 --> 00:58:49,322
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

909
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:52,155
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

910
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:55,594
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

911
00:58:55,663 --> 00:58:57,824
You can't leave the reserve!

912
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:10,575
What are you doing?

913
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:13,006
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

914
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:15,505
Could you leave the hat?

915
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,244
Marty! I know you're in there.

916
00:59:18,353 --> 00:59:21,345
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

917
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:24,621
You've been a great friend.

918
00:59:24,692 --> 00:59:28,184
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

919
00:59:28,263 --> 00:59:30,128
that I never think of you having any.

920
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:34,024
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

921
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,367
Just like back at the zoo.

922
00:59:37,272 --> 00:59:41,538
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

923
00:59:42,377 --> 00:59:44,038
I just want you to know that I...

924
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:46,877
You're one in a million.

925
00:59:47,382 --> 00:59:49,213
This is touching.

926
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:50,717
It is touching.

927
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:54,544
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

928
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:57,214
That's right. Gotcha!

929
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,153
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

930
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:02,162
You, right there.

931
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,496
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

932
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:07,967
That's you, Marty.

933
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:10,064
I know it's you.

934
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:13,965
Know what makes you special?

935
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:18,746
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

936
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,641
You're a dreamer, Marty.

937
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:24,578
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

938
01:00:24,919 --> 01:00:27,251
and horrible taste in friends.

939
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:30,752
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

940
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:34,527
OK, I'm in.

941
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:36,928
Marty, you can't come with me.

942
01:00:36,998 --> 01:00:38,761
You don't have a choice.

943
01:00:43,605 --> 01:00:46,267
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

944
01:00:46,608 --> 01:00:48,269
The people will get you!

945
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,669
Don't lose the hat!

946
01:00:51,546 --> 01:00:52,877
Bye, hat!

947
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:57,543
Any water?

948
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:01,286
No, just more diamonds and gold.

949
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:07,960
Don't give up hope.

950
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:10,930
Listen up! I will help you!

951
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:14,127
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

952
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:17,466
I, your beloved King Julien

953
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:22,636
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

954
01:01:22,977 --> 01:01:25,810
in the volcano!

955
01:01:29,317 --> 01:01:30,477
What does that do?

956
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:33,380
What does that do? Excellent question.

957
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,749
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

958
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:40,817
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

959
01:01:41,162 --> 01:01:43,323
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

960
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:46,265
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

961
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,700
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

962
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,204
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

963
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:54,332
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

964
01:01:56,844 --> 01:01:59,938
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

965
01:02:00,048 --> 01:02:03,882
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

966
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,180
What?

967
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,746
Does it work?

968
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:09,520
No! I mean, yes.

969
01:02:10,024 --> 01:02:11,514
Well, Maurice?

970
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:14,191
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

971
01:02:15,196 --> 01:02:17,027
We'll do it!

972
01:02:18,032 --> 01:02:19,363
Excellent!

973
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:23,902
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

974
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:25,963
and get eaten by gods.

975
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,268
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

976
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:32,871
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

977
01:02:33,214 --> 01:02:38,117
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

978
01:02:38,186 --> 01:02:40,211
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

979
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:53,394
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

980
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:56,460
Melman, what is wrong with you?

981
01:02:56,738 --> 01:03:01,402
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

982
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:03,506
Are you nuts?

983
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:06,274
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

984
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:09,680
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

985
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:12,010
It was always you.

986
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:14,520
Seeing you every day.

987
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:16,750
That's what kept me going.

988
01:03:20,428 --> 01:03:22,419
Melman! Wait!

989
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:28,162
Melman! Melman! Melman!

990
01:03:30,938 --> 01:03:33,429
You going to mope like this all day?

991
01:03:34,275 --> 01:03:35,765
Don't "hmph" me.

992
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:39,707
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

993
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:44,650
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

994
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:46,846
What are you saying, woman?

995
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:51,953
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

996
01:04:01,302 --> 01:04:02,633
Zuba!

997
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:05,299
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

998
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,201
What do you want?

999
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:08,469
It's awful.

1000
01:04:09,143 --> 01:04:10,872
The watering hole is dried up.

1001
01:04:10,945 --> 01:04:13,880
Dried up? That's impossible!

1002
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:15,813
There's nothing left!

1003
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:19,649
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

1004
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:23,953
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

1005
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:25,617
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

1006
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:28,423
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

1007
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:30,760
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

1008
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,900
You stay here, in case he comes back!

1009
01:04:37,505 --> 01:04:39,166
Hurry, Zuba!

1010
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,104
I'm so parched.

1011
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:52,847
Is this place starting to freak you out?

1012
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,448
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

1013
01:04:57,525 --> 01:04:59,254
Why are we doing this?

1014
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:02,860
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

1015
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:05,730
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

1016
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,963
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1017
01:05:09,036 --> 01:05:14,474
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

1018
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,702
What?!

1019
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:18,476
As far as my dad is concerned.

1020
01:05:18,546 --> 01:05:21,140
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

1021
01:05:21,382 --> 01:05:24,545
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

1022
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:26,610
Marty, this is it!

1023
01:05:27,722 --> 01:05:30,213
This is the clog! Come on.

1024
01:05:37,231 --> 01:05:39,392
Well, there's the water.

1025
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:44,060
Stay down. Look at that.

1026
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:46,737
Knit one, purl two.

1027
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:47,900
It's her.

1028
01:05:47,975 --> 01:05:49,670
- Is this right?
- Very good.

1029
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:51,678
Nana, slow down.

1030
01:05:51,746 --> 01:05:54,510
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

1031
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:56,914
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

1032
01:05:57,852 --> 01:05:59,319
We need dynamite. Got any?

1033
01:05:59,587 --> 01:06:03,580
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

1034
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,589
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

1035
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:10,228
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

1036
01:06:10,298 --> 01:06:13,096
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

1037
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:15,766
No, no! Squiggly squid!

1038
01:06:16,103 --> 01:06:17,195
Etch A Sketch!

1039
01:06:17,438 --> 01:06:20,430
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

1040
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:25,943
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

1041
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:30,014
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

1042
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:33,219
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

1043
01:06:34,489 --> 01:06:37,549
Save us
We love you

1044
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:38,956
OK.

1045
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:41,955
OK, OK, OK.

1046
01:06:48,903 --> 01:06:50,666
- Save us
- Melman

1047
01:06:50,738 --> 01:06:52,467
- We love you
- Melman

1048
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,529
Save us

1049
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:56,042
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

1050
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,101
- Melman
- We love you

1051
01:06:58,179 --> 01:06:59,737
- Melman
- Save us

1052
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,509
Here we go! Here we go!

1053
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,583
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

1054
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,311
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

1055
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:12,047
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

1056
01:07:12,326 --> 01:07:15,159
So Melman's not dying!

1057
01:07:15,663 --> 01:07:18,325
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

1058
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:19,655
Melman!

1059
01:07:19,934 --> 01:07:21,265
Move!

1060
01:07:21,502 --> 01:07:25,268
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

1061
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:30,208
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

1062
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:31,267
Yes!

1063
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:37,807
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

1064
01:07:37,885 --> 01:07:39,944
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

1065
01:07:40,187 --> 01:07:41,518
Because...

1066
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:02,436
You can't do this, Melman.

1067
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,371
First, that hurts.

1068
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:07,773
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

1069
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:10,373
Melman, I gotta know...

1070
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:14,043
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

1071
01:08:15,056 --> 01:08:16,455
Of course I did.

1072
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,884
- That's crazy.
- It is?

1073
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:25,555
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

1074
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:28,897
...to find out the perfect guy for me

1075
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:30,897
lived right next door.

1076
01:08:31,906 --> 01:08:34,238
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

1077
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:37,137
You and me for the next 18 hours.

1078
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:39,572
I'll take whatever you got.

1079
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:47,183
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

1080
01:08:47,254 --> 01:08:50,087
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

1081
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:54,089
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

1082
01:08:54,362 --> 01:08:56,592
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

1083
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:03,167
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

1084
01:09:03,237 --> 01:09:04,932
Now, maternity leave.

1085
01:09:05,006 --> 01:09:08,498
Maternity leave? You're all males.

1086
01:09:08,576 --> 01:09:11,067
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

1087
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:14,080
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

1088
01:09:14,148 --> 01:09:17,515
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

1089
01:09:17,585 --> 01:09:21,919
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

1090
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:29,486
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

1091
01:09:38,606 --> 01:09:41,268
All right. You get your maternity leave.

1092
01:09:42,677 --> 01:09:44,008
Finally.

1093
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:51,948
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

1094
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:55,682
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

1095
01:09:56,023 --> 01:09:57,684
This is wrong.

1096
01:09:57,758 --> 01:10:01,319
You see? You are survivors.

1097
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:05,195
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1098
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:07,157
You can't eat a lion.

1099
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:09,168
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

1100
01:10:09,236 --> 01:10:11,534
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1101
01:10:12,373 --> 01:10:14,534
She's out of her mind, people!

1102
01:10:16,677 --> 01:10:18,372
I'm from New York City!

1103
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:21,114
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

1104
01:10:28,723 --> 01:10:29,712
Dad!

1105
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:34,890
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

1106
01:10:36,897 --> 01:10:38,728
Stay behind me.

1107
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:41,996
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

1108
01:10:42,236 --> 01:10:43,567
Stay back!

1109
01:10:43,904 --> 01:10:45,895
You'd let your dinner get away?

1110
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:55,579
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

1111
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:00,809
What the heck?

1112
01:11:05,926 --> 01:11:08,258
Hey, I know those moves.

1113
01:11:08,696 --> 01:11:09,754
Alex?

1114
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:15,497
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

1115
01:11:15,836 --> 01:11:17,201
It is Alex!

1116
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:19,933
Only one lion can move like that!

1117
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:26,610
He's beautiful.

1118
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:27,836
I can't believe it.

1119
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:36,783
How does he do that?

1120
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:50,862
What are you doing?

1121
01:11:51,138 --> 01:11:53,800
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

1122
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:55,631
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

1123
01:11:56,644 --> 01:11:58,305
Butterfly!

1124
01:12:00,981 --> 01:12:02,812
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

1125
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,653
Roar!

1126
01:12:26,674 --> 01:12:29,666
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

1127
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:31,238
Dad, look out!

1128
01:12:33,347 --> 01:12:34,507
What the...

1129
01:12:34,782 --> 01:12:36,340
Alex! Get in!

1130
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:40,179
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

1131
01:12:40,454 --> 01:12:42,046
- What?
- She's got a gun!

1132
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:44,521
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

1133
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:52,689
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

1134
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:56,027
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

1135
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:58,602
All right! But it's his funeral.

1136
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:02,540
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

1137
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:05,368
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1138
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:14,051
Come back! That's my dinner!

1139
01:13:14,288 --> 01:13:15,949
Kowalski, full throttle.

1140
01:13:18,559 --> 01:13:19,548
Music!

1141
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:23,153
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

1142
01:13:23,397 --> 01:13:27,299
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

1143
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:31,560
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

1144
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,903
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

1145
01:13:37,077 --> 01:13:39,739
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

1146
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:42,972
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

1147
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:50,418
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

1148
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:51,989
Are you sure?

1149
01:13:52,259 --> 01:13:56,753
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

1150
01:13:57,097 --> 01:13:58,428
No! Medic!

1151
01:14:03,103 --> 01:14:04,263
Ramming speed!

1152
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:10,101
Bring it on!

1153
01:14:12,446 --> 01:14:14,277
Bad kitties.

1154
01:14:21,956 --> 01:14:24,948
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

1155
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:27,624
The science seemed so solid.

1156
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:32,795
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

1157
01:14:42,476 --> 01:14:44,467
It's you! I found you!

1158
01:14:44,712 --> 01:14:45,701
Mort?

1159
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:50,143
Bad fishy!

1160
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,060
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

1161
01:15:02,396 --> 01:15:03,988
Let's find out.

1162
01:15:05,499 --> 01:15:06,830
Look, Maurice.

1163
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:10,998
- That was quick.
- I did it!

1164
01:15:11,338 --> 01:15:13,829
I did it! I did it!

1165
01:15:15,175 --> 01:15:16,164
OK, you did it!

1166
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:18,173
Oh, yes!!

1167
01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:45,293
Look!

1168
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:47,704
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

1169
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:50,207
You did it!

1170
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:52,702
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

1171
01:15:59,053 --> 01:16:01,044
Zuba! Alakay!

1172
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:02,644
You're back!

1173
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,449
I'm so glad you're safe!

1174
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:09,055
Out of my way.

1175
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,062
Well, well, well.

1176
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:17,561
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

1177
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:19,736
And you were kicked out.

1178
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:23,738
So don't think that this
changes anything.

1179
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:28,812
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

1180
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:31,347
A man bag. Very popular where Im from.

1181
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:33,784
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

1182
01:16:33,854 --> 01:16:39,019
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

1183
01:16:39,259 --> 01:16:41,250
But you're still banished.

1184
01:16:41,495 --> 01:16:43,258
We figured you'd say that.

1185
01:16:45,432 --> 01:16:47,593
My handbag!

1186
01:16:48,368 --> 01:16:49,835
You bad kitty!

1187
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,298
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1188
01:17:05,853 --> 01:17:07,844
You deserve this, son.

1189
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:11,117
Welcome to the pride.

1190
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:18,630
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

1191
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:21,457
No, son. To us!

1192
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,804
My son! The King of New York!

1193
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:34,470
That's my baby!

1194
01:17:41,822 --> 01:17:44,814
Love transcends all differences.

1195
01:17:45,492 --> 01:17:49,826
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

1196
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:53,997
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

1197
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:58,765
For better, please.

1198
01:18:00,174 --> 01:18:02,665
What a beautiful, weird couple!

1199
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,841
That's not going to last.

1200
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:07,913
Can I kiss the bride?

1201
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:09,840
No! Music!

1202
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:11,676
- Struts.
- Check.

1203
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:13,008
- Flaps!
- Check.

1204
01:18:13,253 --> 01:18:15,016
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

1205
01:18:17,524 --> 01:18:19,185
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

1206
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:20,453
See you later!

1207
01:18:20,527 --> 01:18:23,462
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

1208
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:25,361
or whenever the gold runs out.

1209
01:18:25,599 --> 01:18:26,793
Come back soon!

1210
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:31,962
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

1211
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:34,064
You're right about that!

1212
01:18:34,141 --> 01:18:36,075
As long as I'm with her...

1213
01:18:36,143 --> 01:18:39,943
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

1214
01:18:40,214 --> 01:18:42,705
She has the most amazing laugh.

1215
01:18:45,552 --> 01:18:47,884
Love has no boundaries!

1216
01:18:48,822 --> 01:18:51,154
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

1217
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:56,662
Dad? What's wrong?

1218
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,392
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

1219
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:03,962
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

1220
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:07,639
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

1221
01:19:10,577 --> 01:19:12,238
I got you, son!

1222
01:19:12,846 --> 01:19:15,178
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

1223
01:19:15,249 --> 01:19:17,683
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

1224
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:21,016
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

1225
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:23,283
Ain't no Marty here.

1226
01:19:23,357 --> 01:19:27,794
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

1227
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:31,126
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1228
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,463
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

1229
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:37,799
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

1230
01:19:37,871 --> 01:19:39,702
But now that I'm home

1231
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:43,436
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

1232
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:47,107
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
