你真是个怪孩子 怪孩子

我好像刚刚在飞机的机翼上 看到默特了
I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.

134
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:20,077
你太想念马达加斯加了

是啊 太美妙了

136
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,425
我觉得我们走越远 越能回想到更多的乐趣
I think we will see much more fun the further way we get from.

137
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,049
回想什么 你咬我的屁股吗
Yeah, like when you beat me on the butt?

138
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,033
我要把这个 你一直说的这件事

So all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.

141
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,528
所有的"屁股小吃" 都在沙拉吧的油面包旁边吗
Are the butts next to the crutons at the salad bar?

142
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,877

我们回去的时候 我没准可以报名参加那个繁殖计划
When we get back, I might assign up for the breeding program.

- 繁殖计划? - 我觉得我们都到了一把年纪了
- Breeding program? - I think we all reach a point on our lives...

145
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:53,412

Do you mind going back? This is first class.

158
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,594
没什么针对你个人的 只是说 我们比你好而已
It's nothing personal, it's just that we are better than you.

159
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:41,067

- Analysis. - It looks like a small incandescent bulb designed to

172
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:18,003
应该是有什么不寻常的东西 比如机械故障
indicate something out of the ordinary. Like a malfunction.

173

178
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,513
伙计们 系好安全带

00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,630
Buckle up boys.

180

小小的亲而已 蜻蜓点水那种

OK. I'm OK. OK. I'm alive.

217
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,919
我连好好睡觉都不行吗
See, I can't even sleep for a minute.

218
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:20,812
你知道么 这里也不是纽约肯尼迪机场
You know what, this is not JFK.

219
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,678

科沃斯基 我觉得我们要化困境为优势
Kowalski,  I say we use this setback to our advantage.

230
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,701

Where do you get, where do you pull that number out of, huh?

Why don't you and your friends dig a tree, maybe find water.

等一下 等等 谁说你可以当这个...
Hold on, hold on a second. Who made you...

谁给你的权力 让我来指挥的?
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?

239
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:12,910

You will remain in charge. You and your little happy friends can stay out of our hair.

242
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,208
没错! 就是这样!

We could use your front cortexes and apposable thumbs.

你是对的 是对的 我们被困在这里了
You're right. Right, we are stuck here.

252
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:52,653

00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,542
你的朋友是谁呀? 或者那是你的屁股?
Who is your friend, or is that your butt?

397
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,791
你反应倒是真快
Girl, you are as quick as you all have to.

398
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,266
所以 你叫摩托摩托?
So, you are Moto Moto.

399
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,840
这么好听的名字 当然要说两次
The name is so nice, when you say it twice.

400
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:46,841
- 我还挺喜欢的 猛男 - 再见吧 女孩
- I kind of a like it that so. - I see you around new.

401
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:50,749
但不会很难的 因为你好... 丰满
I won't be hard, because you're so plumpy.

402
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,509
我真的很不喜欢扫兴 祖巴
Oops. I hate to be a party pooper Zuba...

403
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:04,717
但部落里其它的狮子想问问
but some of the other lions are wondering...

404
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,948
你什么时候才会把你的儿子流放走
when you are going to banish your son.

405
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,110
你到底在说什么 麻昆加?
What are you talking about, Makunga?

406
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,530
其实也没什么 真的 他们只是在碎碎念
It's nothing really,if their great being about who...

407
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:15,024
艾力提并没有遵循 正统的通过仪式什么的
Alakay never went through the rite of passage, bla bla bla...

408
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,526
所以 理论上说
So, technically speaking...

409
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:20,874
他并不能成为部落的一员 于礼不合的
...he can't be a member of the pride, it's nonsense.

410
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:23,269
我都忘了有通过仪式了
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.

411
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,635
那是什么? 什么通过 什么仪式啊
What is it? What is this rite of passage?

412
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:28,155
是个祖先传下来的传统
It's a traditional common of a ceremony...

413
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:31,806
年轻的狮子可以 表演他们的技术 来换取他们的地位
where young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.

414
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:34,304
表演技术? 像歌唱表演那种吗?
Sort of a show skill, talent show, tab dale?

415
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:35,831
是呀 全投入就好了
Yeah, sturdiness stuff.

416
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:38,839
太棒了 表演! 虽然不是我的强项
Great informers. I think that's up my alley guys.

417
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:40,633
不过既然是传统 我想做做看
If it's tradition, I want to do it.

418
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:44,515
打给他们看看 让我的鬃毛 得到应有的尊重 我想当艾力凯
Stud my stuff. Earn my mane. I want to be Alakuy.

419
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,108
- 艾力提 - 艾力提 还要更好
- Alakay. - Alakay. Even better.

420
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:49,874
明天一大早 我们就举行通过仪式
We'll hold the rite of passage first thing in the morning.

421
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:52,804
太棒了 祝你好运 艾力提
That's wonderful. Good luck Alakay.

422
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:54,869
在我以前的地方 我们会说"表演成功"
Where I come from we say: Break a leg.

423
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,798
这才是我的儿子
Oh, that's my boy.

424
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:23,364
真美 不是吗
Beautiful, isn't it?

425
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,501
- 是啊 - 太美妙了
- Yeah. - It's amazing.

426
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,786
大家 这才是我们真正属于的地方
Guys, this is where we belong.

427
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,714
"旅客陷阱行动"马上就要开始了
Operation tourist trap is in go.

428
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:36,631
哦 这句话说的好 真的好
Oh, I like that one. That's a good one.

429
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,667
很多方面都是这样
That works on many levels sir.

430
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:40,337
你们两个真是马屁精!
You guys are a bunch of suck ups.

431
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,480
- 这也是实话 - 绝对的
- That too sir. - Absolutely.

432
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,131
各就各位
Hide. Stations.

433
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:45,895
第一步 去!
Stage one. Go.

434
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:02,518
哦 不! 我都做了些什么?
Oh no. What've I done.

435
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:04,157
来吧 上钩
Come on, take the bait.

436
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:07,738
- 怎么办 怎么办 - 它死了吗

437
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:11,990
第二步 伙计们 走 走!
Stage two. Go, go, go.

438
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:22,054
我会给他生命之吻

439
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,644
瑞哥

440
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:30,113

443
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,157
停车! 回来!
Stop. Come back.

444
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,052
这些是什么烂摇滚乐?
What is all that rock'n roll racket?

445
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:56,321
她死了吗
Is she dead?

446
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:57,244
没有
No!

447
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,186
强盗!
You hood ones!

448
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:11,041
你没事吗
Good heavens. Are you OK?

449
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:14,099
女士 我找到了你的手提包
Lady, I found your pocket bag.

450
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,269
我的手提包! 你真是个好孩子
Oh, my hand bag. Such a good boy.

451
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,474
没有它 娜娜不能生活的
Man, I can't survive without it.

452
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:22,901
您真强悍啊
Wow, you are a one tough cookie.

453
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:25,292
女童子军 第2416号 铜章
Brownies, root for sixteen. Yonkers.

454
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,169
好了 大家别紧张
OK. Nobody panic.

455
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:29,832
现在最明智的选择就是呆在一起
The best thing we can do is stay together.

456
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,268
等下一辆游览车
We'll wait for another tour jeep.

457
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,416
可能需要几个小时 天色也开始暗了...
It may take hours and it's getting dark but...

458
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:35,589
你去哪啊
Where are you going?

459
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:38,446
我可不想露天站着 等动物来攻击我们
I'm not gonna stay out in the opening get attacked by more animals.

460
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:40,508
我太老了 还不想死
I'm too old to die.

461
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,783
我不知道你们要怎么样 但我要跟她一起走
I don't know about you guys but I'm going with her.

462
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,358
老太太 等等我们

463
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,305
拜托! 我们要... 在... 一起

464
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,046
算了 就往那走吧
Fine, we'll go that way.

465
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:54,938
有人想吃热糖么
Does anyone want a hot candy?

466
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:02,237
小心脚步
Easy now. Watch your step.

467
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:04,370
而就是这里了
And this, right here.

468
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,507
准备好了吗
OK. Are you ready?

469
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:10,410
你一直都睡这
This is where you always slept.

470
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,633
哦 哇
Oh man!

471
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,182
- 这个以前是我的吗 - 玩吧 亲爱的
- Was this mine? - Look at you. Look at him honey.

472
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:24,369
哦 这个东西 看看! 我记得它!
Oh my. Oh this thing. Look, look. I remember this.

473
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,518
你记得?
You remember.

474
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,617
- 这比我期待的要硬了点... - 你从来不在这睡的
- Harder than I... - You never slept on the right end.

475
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,598
最后都滚到底下去
You always slept on the bottom end.

476
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:35,512
那 那是不是我的...
Was that, was that my?

477
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:39,392
那是我吗
Is that me?

478
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,549
你的小爪子是最可爱的
You had the cutest little paws.

479
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:44,240
很小 很小的小爪子
Little bit of paws.

480
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,621
这就是我们失去你那天 你印上去的
You did that the day we lost you.

481
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:48,533
是啊
Year!

482
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:51,081
哇 我当时很小啊
Wow. I was so young.

483
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,066
在我身上发生了什么事?
What happened to me?

484
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:57,701
是我的错 我转过身了 就那么一秒...
It was all my fault. I turned my back for a minute and...

485
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:59,787
那不是你的错
It was not your fault.

486
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,502
你爸爸真的尽力了
Your father did everything he could.

487
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,080
他跟踪了那些猎人整整好几周
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

488
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:10,259
- 离保护区很远很远 - 最后 我也只好认为
Far off the reserve. Finally I had to assume that the hunters... Well...

489
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:15,515
我们以为... 我们以为他们把你杀了
We thought, we thought they killed you.

490
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:18,242
但我的儿子把那些猎人都打垮了是不是?
But my son fought those hunters off ha?

491
00:32:18,244 --> 00:32:19,916
别跟纽约之王作对!
Don't mess with the king of New York.

492
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,516
没错!
That's right.

493
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,354
好啦 好啦 大男孩 小心点
Alright, alright boys. Be careful.

494
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,415
别打碎了东西
Watch out before you break something.

495
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:30,490
你以前管这个叫 "扑扑"
You used to call this Fufi.

496
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:33,993
扑扑? 扑扑!
Fufi? Fufi.

497
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,990
- 他不会想要那个的 - 还给我 我的扑扑!
Oh, he doesn't want that thing. Give my Fufi.

498
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:42,493
祖巴 你最好把他的扑扑给他
Zuba, you'd better give him his Fufi.

499
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:46,594
我并不知道... 谢谢 谢谢 它很完美
I mean no, thank you, thank you. It's perfect.

500
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:49,094
那 儿子 休息吧
Well son, you get your rest...

501
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,659
明天将会是盛大的一天 你会需要全部的力量
you'll have a big day tomorrow.You're gonna need all your strength.

502
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,614
我会为了你 让欢呼声把屋顶掀起来的
I'm gonna bring the house down for you dad.

503
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:59,712
我也这么希望 要不然你的父亲必须要流放你了
I hope so, otherwise your father would have to banish you.

504
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:01,579
哦 天 真的吗
Oh gee, not really?

505
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:03,868
我知道你会让我们骄傲的
I know you're gonna do us proud.

506
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:06,213
你知道为什么吗
You know why?

507
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:08,856
你命中注定就是这样
You were born with it.

508
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,177
晚安 艾力提
Good night Alakay.

509
00:33:12,178 --> 00:33:15,005

510
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:19,603
我的儿子是个大王
My son is a king.

511
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:22,857

没有任何人类文明的征兆
No sign of civilization.

518
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:59,749
大家都很累 我觉得我们迷路了
Everybody appears very tired. I think we're lost.

519
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,815
嘿 娜娜 你知不知道你在往哪走啊
Hey Nana, do you even know where you are going?

520
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:07,132
不知道 不过我一路小跑 面带笑容
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.

521
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:10,237
哦 是嘛 那好吧
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, alright.

522
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:15,241
- 哦 是人啊 你们从哪来的 - 你们怎么到这里来的
It's people. Where do you come from? How could we get out of here?

523
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,051
你们能帮帮我们吗 我们迷路了
Can you help us, we're lost?

524
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,142
我们也迷路了
We are lost too.

525
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:21,076
真的很可怕 一个黑白的东西 掠过我们眼前 然后就没了
It was awful, a flash of black and white never gone.

526
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:22,781
他们把吉普车 所有东西都拿走了
They took the jeep, everything.

527
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,104
- 我们的吉普车也一样 - 我们要怎么办
- That happened to our jeep too. - What are we gonna do?

528
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:27,140
- 我们要怎么存活 - 没有食物
Only hope to survive out here! No food,

529
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:30,415
没有水 没有屋子 我们该怎么办呀!?
no water, no shelter. What are we gonna do?

530
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,652
你可以让大自然征服你
You can let nature get the best of you,

531
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:38,856
或者你可以征服大自然呀
or you can get the best of nature.

532
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,000
围过来吧 孩子们
Gather around children.

533
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:46,154
- 都是纽约客 是吧 - 是啊
- We are New Yorkers, right? - Yeah.

534
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:48,700
我们都能在水泥林里生存了!
We survived in a concrete jungle.

535
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:49,549
没错
Right!

536
00:34:49,573 --> 00:34:54,100
我们饿的时候 就四处找 好吃的热狗 我说的对吗
If we need food, we hunt for a decent hotdogs stand, am I right?

537
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:55,272
她是对的
She is right.

538
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:58,352
我们需要屋子 就盖起摩天大楼
If we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.

539
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,364
- 是啊 - 我们需要水
If we need water,

540
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,402
就建造一个人工水库
we build a dam.

541
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:05,227
是啊! 我们是纽约客耶! 拜托一下!
Come on, we're New Yorkers.

542
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,673
我们在那里可以 我们哪里都可以!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere.

543
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:28,339
我来了 朱利安国王
I'm coming King Julien.

544
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:37,596
鱼 小鱼
Fish! Fish!

545
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:41,059
鲨鱼 不
No! Shark!

546
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:51,583
老大 所有的零件我们都有了
Skipper, we have all the parts we need...

547
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,476
可我们还是比计划稍稍迟了一点
but we're slightly behind schedule.

548
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,586
- 多迟? - 6到9年
- How slightly?  - Six to nine years.

549
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:58,811
- 69年? - 不是 是6到9年
- Sixty nine years?  - No six to nine years.

550
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:02,108
大兵 我们的拇指呢
Privates, what happened to our thumbs?

551
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,001
从昨天就没看见他们了
Haven't seen them since yesterday sir. Damn you...

552
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:08,512
在我眼皮底下 谁都不能去
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.

553
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:10,598
大兵 跟我一起走
Private, you are coming with me.

554
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,213
瑞哥 你跟我一起来
Rico, you are coming with me.

555
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:16,467
追踪他 让他跟我军事法庭见
I'm tracking down to bring them for the court marshall.

556
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,819
没有必要啦
That won't be necessary.

557
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:22,045
我们为你多聘请了一些拇指 队长
We have recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

558
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:32,327
- 有你们的帮忙太好了 - 我严重怀疑
- Floppy of monkeys entered. -I doubt that.

559
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,410
先慢点玩闹 我们开始工作吧 我们分成3组
Enough wallin' gagging now let's get to work. We'll divide into three groups.

560
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,798
A组 你们负责运输和加工
Group alpha, you are charged in seeping of fabrication.

561
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:49,788
B组 你们负责装配 C组 你们负责售后服务
Group Offset, you'll handle assembly. Group George Report: you'll handle gas services.

562
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:51,413
有问题吗?
Any questions?

563
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:53,741
真不错 开始工作吧
Good, then let's get to work.

564
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:04,142
我真想亲亲你 猴子
I'd like to kiss you monkey man.

565
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,856
好吧 但你也太丑了
Alright but you are so darn ugly.

566
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,828
好吧 带点气势 就记住
Alright, so little cubs cats, just remember...

567
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,140
伟大的舞蹈都是由心出发的
great dance performance comes from the heart.

568
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,387
由心出发 你永远也不会错
Just comes straight from your heart and you never go wrong.

569
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:25,219
当然
Sure Mr.

570
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,833
嘿 艾力提 我只是经过 祝你好运
Hey Alakay, I just happened to walk by and wanted to wish luck.

571
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:30,482
你不紧张吧
You're not nervous, are you?

572
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,836
不啦 就等这一天了 我本来也是干这个的
No, it's my thing. You know.It's kind of what I do.

573
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,782
我觉得 如果要在这里大显身手 要记得 选择好的对手
In my opinion; the key of this whole thing is choosing the right competitor.

574
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,970
你说这像跳舞对决一样的吗 像对舞一样
Oh, you mean this is like a dance battle, sort of thing? Like a dance off?

575
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,757
- 嗯 当然 - 那太好了 即兴创造?
- Sure. Great, I loved that. - Freestyle, put your moves out.

576
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:48,502
你觉得谁跟我旗鼓相当? 这样比赛才有看头
Who do you thing would be a good match for me? You know, just to keep the things interesting.

577
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:52,138
我真希望我能帮忙
Well...I wish I could help,

578
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:56,131
但这违反了传统啊 好像很神圣的样子
but that's strictly against to our ancient tradition and although we hold secret but

579
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,226
但如果是我的话
If I was me out there,

580
00:37:58,227 --> 00:37:59,632
我会选择缇西
I'd choose Titsy.

581
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,442
缇西? 好吧 听起来... 还蛮有趣的
Titsy, OK?  Sounds interesting.

582
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,322
- 你叫麻昆加 对吧 - 为了祖巴的孩子 做任何事都好
- Makunga, right? Thank you.  - Anything for Zuba's boy.  Go, get him tight.

583
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:09,384
- 去露一手吧 - 一定的
Shake it out.

584
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:14,645
5678 来吧 放马过来
Come 5678,come on

585
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:35,622
通过仪式正式开始
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.

586
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:37,611
来吧 孩子 让妈妈骄傲!
Come on baby, make mama proud.

587
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,987
- 先等会 先让我说完... - 听到了 妈妈!
- Oh woman, I'm trying to take care of passage here. - Got it mom.

588
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:44,936
- 所以谁想第一个来? - 我 我!
- So who will be the first participant?  - Me, me me...

589
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:48,258
要不然你来吧 这个高高帅帅的孩子
How about you, the tall, handsome one? Right there, yeah.

590
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,834
请选择你的对手
Choose your opponent.

591
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:52,319
让我看看
Let me see.

592
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:56,019
我想 我还是选...
I guess I'll pick...

593
00:38:58,662 --> 00:39:00,619
缇西?
...Titsy.

594
00:39:01,246 --> 00:39:03,074
缇西?
Titsy?

595
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,214
他为什么会选择缇西呢
Why did he pick Titsy?

596
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,441
哦 那就是我的孩子 他真有胆量
Oh, that's my boy, he got some gumption there.

597
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,933
有没有人把他叫醒 叫醒啊
Somebody wake him up, wake him up.

598
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:26,648
哦 是缇西吧 来呀 让他们看看 来吧
Alright, so Titsy. Come on. Let's do this ha?

599
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,127
来吧 缇西
Come on Titsy fly, Titsy fly,

600
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,238
看看你有什么本事 显出来嘛

601
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:33,050
开跳吧
Let's dance.

602
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,494
嗯 不过我要事先警告你 我可是狐步舞
OK. But it's only fair to warn you that...

603
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:39,600
和罗宾逊舞蹈教室的得意门生哦
I'm a prodigy of fupsy and robbins.

604
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:42,194
不是那个舞蹈 是搏斗
Not dance dance, fight.

605
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:46,109
舞斗是吗? 了解了
Oh, dance fight. You got it.

606
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:53,737
- 他是在跳舞吗 - 他在做什么
- Is he dancing?  - What is he doing?

607
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:56,293
我不知道 不过那个孩子确实是在跳舞
I know that boy is not dancing.

608
00:39:56,723 --> 00:39:59,291
这比我想象的还要好
This is even better than I thought.

609
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:04,407
- 艾力提 回头! - 不 爸爸
- Alakay, turn around. - No no pap,

610
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:07,779
是往左挥 往右挥 扭扭屁股 再回头
it's hop shuffle ball change, hip swish, turn around.

611
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:19,950
哦 不
Oh no.

612
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:22,862
艾力提 你受伤了么
Alakay. Are you hurt?

613
00:40:22,863 --> 00:40:24,567
哦 是啊
Oh yeah, I'm.

614
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:26,864
我赢了么
Did I, did I win?

615
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:30,266
不 孩子 这怎么会这样呢
Oh no son, how could, I mean how could this happen?

616
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,345
你告诉我们你是个大王
You told us you were a king.

617
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,286
大王是不会被打倒的
And a king does not get beat.

618
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:38,342
我确实是大王啊 我是纽约之王
Well, I'm a king. I'm a king in New York.

619
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:41,075
那是我的艺名 你知道
It's my stage name. I'm like a, you know,

620
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:43,191
我表演的时候用的
It's for what I perform.

621
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,397
表演?
Perform?

622
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:48,134
哦 真是太不幸了 艾力提没能通过测试
No, this is horrible. Alakay has failed the test.

623
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:51,601
谁会想得到 有朝一日
Who would have ever imagine that the day...

624
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:54,487
祖巴会必须流放...
Zuba would have to banish...

625
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,161
他自己的儿子?
...his own son.

626
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:58,342
祖巴 不要
Zuba, no.

627
00:40:58,344 --> 00:41:00,260
祖巴 要
Zuba, yes.

628
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,081
悲伤的是 现在领头狮子 必须驱逐自己的心头肉
Sadly the alpha lion must cast out all failures.

629
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:19,874
那我不再是领头狮子了
Then, I'm no longer the alpha lion.

630
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:23,857
爸爸 你在做什么 爸爸 别这样
Dad, what are you doing?

631
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,050
爸爸 你不能这么做的
Dad no, you can't do this.

632
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:30,332
谁能顶替祖巴的位子呢?
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

633
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:33,872
有人吗 任何人吗
Anyone? Someone?

634
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:35,424
- 没人吗 - 嘿
- No one? - Hey.

635
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,977
你吗 先生?
You sir.

636
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:38,625
看来不行
I guess not.

637
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:42,167
呃 虽然这么说很奇怪 不过
Well I, this is all very awkward, but...

638
00:41:42,215 --> 00:41:45,659
我想 我能担负起这个重任
I suppose, I could carry this tremendous burden.

639
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,054
缇西 把帽子拿过来
Titsy, get the hat.

640
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,837
作为你们新的领袖
As your new leader

641
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:54,835
我现在宣布流放艾力提
I hereby banish Alakay...

642
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,565
他应当戴起这个代表耻辱的帽子
...he shell wear this hat of shame and...

643
00:41:57,566 --> 00:42:00,265
离开水塘
leave the watering hole.

644
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,071
期限为一千年 或 一辈子
For a thousand years or life...

645
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,924
看哪个迟来
...whichever comes last.

646
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:12,190
唉 走开 走开
Come on. Shoo shoo. Get out of here.

647
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:14,396
你应该告诉我们的 儿子
You should have told us son.

648
00:42:14,397 --> 00:42:16,726
你应该告诉我们你不是个真正的大王
You should have told us that you weren't a real king.

649
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:19,054
你可没说我得和人打架
You never told me that I have to fight anybody.

650
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,459
不然你想怎样?
What did you expect son?

651
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:22,789
我不知道 可能你可以作为父亲 给我一点建议呢
I don't know, maybe a fatherly advice,

652
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:26,232
- 比如 "儿子 那是个搏斗" - 但你是狮子 不是吗
- like: hey son...it's a fight. - You are a lion, aren't you?

653
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,952
但我从来没有跟其他狮子搏斗过
But I never fought another lion in my life.

654
00:42:27,954 --> 00:42:29,772
当然没有 你是跳舞的嘛
Yeah, yes, right. You dance.

655
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:31,567
还有其他的事情 但重点是
And other stuff. The point is,

656
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,163
你的朋友麻昆加设计陷害了我
your pal, Makunga...set me up back there

657
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:36,928
- 这一切就不会发生了 如果... - 如果你是个真正的狮子
- I mean, none of these would happen... - If you were a real lion...

658
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:39,262
- 祖巴! - 是啊 我说了!
- Zuba. - Yeah, I said it.

659
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:42,480
真正的狮子?
A real lion?

660
00:42:43,378 --> 00:42:45,585
谢了
Thanks.

661
00:42:48,016 --> 00:42:50,171
太谢谢了
Thanks a lot.

662
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:01,777
锯子

Oh, say. You've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.

666
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:13,521
很好的观察力
Yeah, that's very observative of you Steven.

667
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:15,973
你该发现我全身都是褐斑
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

668
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:19,659

OK. That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.

669
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:22,132
那我不需要去那个等死洞了?
So, I don't have to pick another dying hole?

670
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,580
当然不用 你还有大好的人生可以继续
No, Timo. You've got your whole life ahead of you.

- Thank you doctor Mankiewicz. - Break a leg.

673
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:30,014
可爱的孩子
Sweet kid.

674
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:33,773
呃 那个褐斑像是巫医综合症
This spot looks like witch doctor's disease.

675
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,415
巫医综合症?
Witch doctor's disease?

676
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:39,095
我听过最荒唐的病 史蒂文
That's the most ridiculous disease, I've ever heard of, Steven.

677
00:43:39,302 --> 00:43:41,047
别问
Wow... Don't ask.

678
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:42,406
有人挺淘气啊
Someone has been naughty.

679
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,043
- 可能有点疼 - 我们前任的巫医乔
- OK. This one will hurt a bit. - Joe, our last witch doctor,

680
00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:49,804
也长了像那样的褐斑
he had a spot just like that.

681
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,645
周一乔还活着
Monday Joe

682
00:43:51,646 --> 00:43:53,828
周三乔就没了
Wednesday no Joe.

683
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:57,659
- 周三乔就没了 - 可以呼吸了
- Wednesday no Joe?  - I can breathe.

684
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:58,788
多谢你 医生
Thanks doc.

685
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,850
巫医综合症是真事?
So, this witch doctor's disease is a real thing?

686
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:06,463

You'll find a cure. Hey, you got at least forty eight hours.

00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:08,767
但我从没听说这种病啊
But I have never even heard of it.

688
00:44:08,817 --> 00:44:12,126
我可没有盘尼西林
What? I mean, I don't have any penicillin.

689
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:14,393
而最最基本的 我还必须得做个做X线断层扫描呀
I'm gonna need a catscan just to get started.

690
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:17,815
找只狮子帮你忙啊 他们肯定乐意
You'll have a lion looking over, they'd be happy to.

691
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:32,462
那家伙真是天才 难以置信
Ta daaa. That guy has got talent.

692
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,559
你们肯定没见过这个
Bet you haven't seen that one before.

693
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,280
纽约人看得五体投地
This knock 'em dead in New York.

694
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,635
- 咱们也试试吧 - 好啊 来
- Hey, let's all give it a try. - Yeah, let's do it.

695
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:41,702
等一下
Well, hey hey hey

696
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:44,606
想试就试吧 可得很多年才能练到这水平
I know you want to but it's gonna take years of practice you get never gonna quite get a tight stream...

697
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:49,219
等到练到嘴唇肌肉有力
until you build up your lip muscles to the point...

698
00:44:49,268 --> 00:44:53,577
收缩到一起像这样 明白吗
...where you can purse your lips like this. You got it?

699
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,748
Ta daa...

701
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:19,389
- 你能做 我们也能做 - 这流淌在我们的血液里
- If you can do it. We can do it. - It's in our blood.

702
00:45:19,404 --> 00:45:22,249
我一直以为我有点特殊呢
I always thought, I was a little bit unique.

703
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:23,473
我们确实很特殊啊
We are unique.

704
00:45:23,485 --> 00:45:25,596
大自然的力量创造了我们
Hey, we are like a force of nature.

705
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:27,422
百万个生命
A million points of light.

706
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:28,458
黑条纹
And all stripes.

707
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:31,102
完全一样
Exactly the same.

完全一样
Exactly the same.

709

看起来非常惊人 科沃斯基
Looks impressive Kowalski,

710
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:39,397
能飞吗
but will it fly?

711
00:45:39,422 --> 00:45:43,399
如果折这边 这边 那边 就能飞了
Yes, if we fold it here, here and here.

712
00:45:45,436 --> 00:45:47,565
漂亮
Nice.

713
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,544
哦 老天爷啊
Oh man,

714
00:46:00,568 --> 00:46:03,161
唉 老爸认为我是个完全的笨蛋
my dad thinks I'm a total loser.

715
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:04,867
我毁了我父母的生活
I have ruined my parent's lifes.

716
00:46:04,882 --> 00:46:06,896
那可一点也不屌
That is definitely not crackalacking.

717
00:46:06,946 --> 00:46:09,808
简直是超衰 伙计
It's lacking in the craken my friend.

718
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:12,135
我得弥补错误
I have got to fix this.

719
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:14,124
那个
So

720
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,234
有件事...

721
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:19,169
- 有事要告诉你们 - 嘿 伙计们
- there is something I gotto tell you. - Hey guys.

722
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:22,224
这地方简直是天堂 不是吗
Is this place great or what?

723
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:23,613
我选"不是吗"
I'd go with or what.

724
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:26,833
告诉你们 你们绝对不会相信 不过
Oh well, I tell you what. You're not gonna believe it but...

725
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:30,715
我和摩托摩托开始约会了
I got a date with Moto Moto.

726
00:46:31,307 --> 00:46:32,360
谁是摩托摩托?
Who is Moto Moto.

727
00:46:32,362 --> 00:46:36,873
他高大 英俊 很壮
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big.

728
00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:38,376
你知道摩托摩托代表什么吗?
You know what Moto Moto means?

729
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:39,249
双胞胎?
Twins?

730
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:41,319
是"帅哥帅哥"
It means hot hot.

731
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:42,522
"帅哥帅哥"?
Hot hot?

732
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:45,797
好吧 你何时变得这么非洲本土化的?
OK, when did you start parley in African?

733
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:47,705
- 这流淌在我的血液里 - 别担心
- It's in my blood. - Don't worry.

734
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,626
你可以等我走了之后 再和帅哥调情
You can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

735
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,510
为什么 梅尔曼 我在兴头上炫耀 你干嘛老泼冷水
What's the deal Melman? Why am I the parade and you are the rain?

736
00:46:53,534 --> 00:46:55,872
那你为什么每次都在我这里炫耀
Why do you have to dry the parade under my rain?

737
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,452
那我下次在城市的另一区炫耀去了
Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town.

738
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:01,750
- 冷静冷静 - 随你便 不过主街是我的
- Fine by me. - By the way, the main streets mine.

739
00:47:01,761 --> 00:47:05,442

741
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:10,437
- 这么乱啊 - 别吵了
Come on Melman

742

743
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,306
说什么? 说... 我不明白你说什么
what? Tell her, what are you talking about? I don't know what you are talking about.

744
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,387
- 好吧 我要走了 - 你知道么 不必麻烦了
- So I guess, I'll go then. - You know what, don't bother.

745
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:20,719
那就少找我麻烦!
Don't get up in my account.

746
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:22,782
不不不 梅尔曼 格洛丽娅

你以为我是他?
You thought I was him?

756
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:50,816
你们长得有点 很像
You guys do kind of look a little a lot you look a lot alike.

757
00:47:50,865 --> 00:47:53,046
对吧 马蒂 你们长得很像 你们笑起来一样
Marty you look a lot alike, come on. You laugh alike, you talk alike,

I mean that is a little weird. Really, you two guys are, come on Marty.

760
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,014
看来我果然不是独一无二啊
So you're saying there is nothing unique about me

761
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:05,010
我和其他斑马没有区别
I am just like any other zebra.

762
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:07,064
你当然是与众不同的
No, of course you are different.

763
00:48:07,113 --> 00:48:08,592
怎么不同?
How? How?

764
00:48:10,108 --> 00:48:12,374
好吧 我分不清
OK. I can't tell you apart.

765
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:15,067
不过你可以戴个铃什么的
Maybe you could wear a bell or something. I don't know.

766
00:48:15,116 --> 00:48:17,704
- 铃? - 不 不是铃 戴铃是个很烂的主意
- A bell?  - OK. not a bell, no bell is a bad idea.

767
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:21,036
不不 不如穿写着"我是傻瓜"的T恤吧
No, no, no. How about a t-shirt that says: "I'm with stupid."?

768
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,647
- 我不傻 - 你不傻 是他傻
- I am not stupid. - Not you stupid, him stupid!

769
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,029
你知道吗 你和那群马玩乐时
You know what? While you have been off doing prancing pony with the new pussy.

I have been having pretty much the worst day of my life, OK?

771
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:34,906
事情都是围绕你转 对吧
It's always about you, isn't it?

772
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:38,131
我的问题只是比你的重要一点 马蒂
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours Marty.

773
00:48:38,156 --> 00:48:41,478
就算分不清你和别人 又怎样
All right, I couldn't tell you apart. So what?

774
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:44,606
行啊 走吧 马蒂 你只有这个在行
Yeah fine, run away Marty! Run away. That's what you do best,

775
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:47,565
跟在纽约时一样
just like back in New York!

776
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:51,033
我在这儿 不过你分不清楚 对吧
I'm right here. But you can't tell that right?

777
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,034
你真是百万里挑一的朋友
Your one in a million friend...

778

祝你继续自己一个人享受你的那个 "比任何其他人都重要的问题" !
hopes you enjoy your bigger than everyone else's problems, alone!

779
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,400
走就走吧 我不需要你帮我解决问题
Good, leave! I don't need you to help me solve my problems.

780
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,577
你们大同小异 我就是分不清楚 谁是马蒂又怎样 我不在乎
You know what? You diame dust I can't tell which one is Marty.

781
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:09,569
哪个是马蒂 等一下 哦 谁在乎
Oh, which one is Marty? Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah! I don't care.

782
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,471
帽子真抢眼 你个臭显摆
Nice hat, you show off!

783
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:20,328
马蒂
Marty...

784
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:21,656
别走
Don't go.

785
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,210
看 莫里斯
Look Maurice.

786
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:30,878
是个好地方 我可以在此建造夏日行宫
Here is the perfect spot for my semi-palace

787
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:34,638
把坑填填 改改水道就行了
so please fill in all these holes and relocate the roofed.

788
00:49:35,714 --> 00:49:37,886
谁把那么好看的头丢在地上了
Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around.

789
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,312
真浪费资源
What a waste.

790
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:42,422
跟我讲一讲 我在等死
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

791
00:49:42,472 --> 00:49:45,099
晚期不治
I'm terminal, you know.

792
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:49,623
可能只剩2天可活了
Probably only have another two days left to live.

793
00:49:49,674 --> 00:49:51,971
那可真不幸
That's a bomber man.

794
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:55,191
如果我 朱利安国王
Oh, if I King Julien, that's my name.

795
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:57,652
只剩2天可活的话
Only had two days left to live.

796
00:49:57,653 --> 00:50:00,829
会实现所有我梦想要做的事
I'd do all the things I have ever dreamed of doing.

797
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:01,822
什么事?
Like what?

798
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:04,966
我想成为职业口哨家
I'd love to became a professional whistler.

799

我现在已经非常令人惊艳了

800
00:50:07,063 --> 00:50:09,173
但我要好上加好
But I wanna get luck even better.

801
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:11,210
完全可以以此为生
I'd make my living out of it.

802
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:21,465
你知道我还会做什么其它事么
You know what else I'd do?

803
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:24,621
我要去侵略临国的地盘
I'd invade a neighboring country and impose...

804
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:28,646
不管他们愿意与否 都会强加我的意识形态予他们
...my own ideology even if they didn't want it.

805
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:31,047
你说得当然简单 你是个国王啊
It's easy for you to say, you are a king.

806
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:35,084
是的 你只是个可悲的小脑袋
Yes. And you are only just a sad little head.

807
00:50:35,412 --> 00:50:39,191
但你在死前 肯定有想做的事
But there must be something you want to do before you die.

808
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,426
嗯 确实有件事
Well...There is this one thing.

809
00:50:41,427 --> 00:50:43,245
什么事? 告诉我
What is it? Tell me.

810
00:50:43,295 --> 00:50:45,015
呃 不行
Well. No, I couldn't.

811
00:50:45,016 --> 00:50:46,543
是什么
I mean. What is it?

812
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:48,701
我从来都鼓不起勇气告诉格洛丽娅
You know, I just never really have the guts to tell Gloria,

813
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,030
- 我如何... - 告诉什么 告诉我啦
how I think about her.  What is it?

814
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,766
我从来不敢告诉格洛丽娅 我对她的感觉
I don't really have the guts to tell Gloria, how I feel about her. What is it?

815
00:50:54,814 --> 00:50:58,209
- 我一直以来对她的感觉 - 嗯 不告诉我就算了
- I have always felt about her. - Fine, don't tell me!

816
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:03,559
是女人吗 你刚才没告诉我 我们现在谈的可是女人啊
Is it a woman? Oh, you didn't tell me we are talking about a woman.

817
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:07,951
你还在怕什么 你反正都快死了
What are you afraid of? You are dead man anyway, come on.

818
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:11,362
没错 是啊 你说对了
Yeah? Yeah...Yeah, you are right.

819
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,570
你一定要迈步向这女人走去
Well, you gotta march right up to this woman,

820
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,332
好吗 注视她的双眼
right? You look her right in the eye,

821
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:21,545
身体向前倾 好吧 低下身子
you lean forward, right? Just a little, almost all the way.

822
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,146
然后你让她向前倾 靠近你 是吧
Then you let her, like, lean forward, just a little bit until you're...

823
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:29,566
只剩一个嘴唇的距离
...just a lips distance away from each other.

824
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:31,989
然后你告诉她
And then you just tell her...

825
00:51:31,991 --> 00:51:33,487
你有多恨她
how much you hate her.

826
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:36,235
啊 事实上
Actually, it's...

827
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:37,997
比较像是有多爱她
it's more like love her.

828
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:41,181
喔 你个多情种子
Oh, you slave dog.

829
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,432
你还真是个花花公子啊 知道吗
You're a real player, you know that?

830

00:51:52,897 --> 00:51:54,035

因为 我的朋友 你找到了完美的女人 朋友
Because you my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.

我若像你样幸运
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman

885
00:54:29,951 --> 00:54:31,866
我会天天送她花束
I would give her flowers every day.

886
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:33,805
而且不是随便什么破花
And not just any flowers, OK?

887
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:36,522
她最喜欢白色的兰花
Her favorites are orchids. White.

888
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:40,442
要在早餐送到床边 六条全麦面包 正反两面都涂黄油
And breakfast in bed. Six loaves of wheat toast with butter on both sides.

889
00:54:40,503 --> 00:54:42,174
不要面包皮 她喜欢这样的做法
No crusts. The way she likes it.

890
00:54:42,222 --> 00:54:45,778
我会借她肩膀哭 成为她最好的朋友
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend...

891
00:54:45,835 --> 00:54:49,510
整天都想怎么让她欢笑
and I'd spend every day trying to think of how to make her laugh.

892
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,837
她有世界上最动听的笑声
She has the most...most amazing laugh.

893
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,828
我是说 我要是你就那么做
Well, I mean. That's what I would do, if I were you.

894
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:02,375
可我不是你 你最好乖乖做
But I'm not. So you do it.

895
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:07,128

897
00:55:11,737 --> 00:55:14,815

很惊讶看到我吗 麻昆加 我来把事情弄清楚
Surprised to see me Makunga? Well I'm here to set things straight.

900
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:25,947
像真正的狮子一样 这个够劲吗 这个呢
Like a real lion. Is this real enough for you? How about this?

901
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,032
这一拳打你胆敢玩阴的
This is for setting me up.

902
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,876
这一拳打你抢了我老爸的工作
This is for stealing my dad's job.

903
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:33,988
这一拳打你让我全家受辱 像傻瓜样被人耻笑
This is for humiliating my family. And making me fun like a fool.

904
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:54,225
打够了? 滚吧
Had enough? Sure fly away.

905
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:56,095
胆小鬼
Coward.

906
00:56:06,665 --> 00:56:09,041
水没有了
The water, it's gone.

907
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:11,492
- 哦 不 - 水塘从没干过
- Oh no. - The watering hole has never gone dry before.

908
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,402
- 我们需要很多等死洞了 - 怎么会这样?
- We're gonna need a lot more dying holes. - How could this happen?

909
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,715
都闪一边去 到底发生什么事了
Out of my way. What is going on here?

910
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:20,781
水干了 我们就一个人喝水都不够了
The watering hole is dried up, there's barely enough water for one of us.

911
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:23,084
- 好观察力 雪莉 - 我是斑比
- Yes, good observation Shirley. - I'm Boby.

912
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,800

- Makunga what will we do?  - Quiet!

913
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:31,645
听着 我想 恐怕只有一个方法 能解决这可怕的危机
Listen up. I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis.

914
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:35,744
- 我们得竞争水源 - 竞争?
- We'll all have to fight for it.  - Fight for it?

915
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,669
这主意太疯狂了
This is crazy.

916
00:56:38,073 --> 00:56:40,351
这不公平 你肯定赢
That's not fair, you'd win.

917
00:56:40,352 --> 00:56:41,806
- 没错 雪莉 - 我是斑...
- Exactly Shirley. - I'm Boby.

918
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:45,782
对不起 伙计们 人生本来就不公平
Sorry folks, but life isn't fair.

919
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:49,883
现在我是领袖 这要多谢谢跳舞的狮子艾力提
I'm in charge now. Thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

920
00:56:49,908 --> 00:56:53,599
求你了 麻昆加 这是保护区唯一的水源
Please Makunga this is the only water on the reserve.

921
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:57,546
如果你渴 你得去保护区外找水喝
If you're thirsty you'll have to look for water off the reserve.

922
00:56:57,934 --> 00:56:59,709
去保护区外?
Off the reserve?

923
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:05,501
- 从没人离开保护区存活的 - 我离开过
- No one leave the reserve and survived. - I left the reserve...

924
00:57:05,841 --> 00:57:07,756
也存活了
and survived.

925
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:12,630
我可以帮忙 好像是水道堵了
I could do something about this. Looks like a clogged pipe.

926
00:57:12,655 --> 00:57:14,206
纽约常有这种事
But we get in New York all the time.

927
00:57:14,255 --> 00:57:17,505
- 只要逆流而上 - 逆流而上? 去保护区外?
- I'll just travel up river.  - Up river? Off the reserve?

928
00:57:17,529 --> 00:57:18,892
你?
You?

929
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:22,792
是我 我能疏通水道 带回水源
Yeah me. I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.

930
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:26,114
太好了 我想帮你收拾行李 不过看到那帽子
Great I'll help you pack but by the looks of that hat...

931
00:57:26,115 --> 00:57:28,210
我想你应该准备好了
I see you're all set.

932
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:32,166
好吧 笑啊 笑掉大牙吧
Yeah fine. Go ahead laugh. Laugh your mane off.

933
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:34,432
我会证明你是错的
I'm gonna prove you're wrong.

934
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:37,285
说不定 你应该试着跳个祈雨舞
May be you should try a little rain dance.

935
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:45,030
如果是祖巴 肯定知道该怎么办 祖巴在哪呢?
Zuba would know what to do. Where is Zuba?

936
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,402
- 你根本不管我们死活 - 祖巴才应该是领袖 不是你
- You don't care about us. - Zuba should be in charge, not you.

937
00:57:48,572 --> 00:57:50,147
祖巴在哪里
Where is Zuba?

938
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:56,622
好了 够了 因为情况特殊
Alright, fine. As an added measure

939
00:57:56,623 --> 00:57:58,853
我会咨询祖巴的
I will consult with Zuba.

940
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:07,331
马蒂?
Marty?

941
00:58:15,484 --> 00:58:17,592
嘿 马蒂?
Hi! Marty?

942
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:24,538
马蒂?
Marty?

943
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:28,392
马蒂?
Marty?

944
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,564
抱歉 打扰一下
Excuse me,Excuse me!

945
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:35,789
嗨 马蒂在吗?
Hi! Is...is Marty in there?

946
00:58:35,814 --> 00:58:38,360
马蒂 有人看见马蒂了吗?
Marty? Is there anyone see Marty?

947
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,071
这样吧 如果见到他了
All right! Well...if you see him

948
00:58:46,072 --> 00:58:48,497
就说他朋友艾力克斯来和他道别了
Tell my friend,Alex came and say goodbye!

949
00:58:48,547 --> 00:58:50,000
- 说再见? - 再见
- goodbye? - Goodbye!

950
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:52,522
别走 你去哪儿 我们也能去吗
Don't go! Can we come?

951
00:58:52,548 --> 00:58:55,408
不用了 这是我必须要独自去解决的事情
No! No! It's something have to do alone!

952
00:59:14,665 --> 00:59:17,453
马蒂 我知道你在这儿
Marty? I know you're there!

953
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:20,737
在走之前 我有话对你说
Before I go,I've got something want to say.

954
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,830
你是个很好的朋友
You've been a great friend.

955
00:59:23,832 --> 00:59:27,265
总让我看到我问题的光亮面

956
00:59:27,494 --> 00:59:30,573
我却没想到你也会有烦心事

957
00:59:30,574 --> 00:59:33,136
你需要我时 我却不在你身边

958
00:59:33,629 --> 00:59:36,659
像在动物园时一样
Just like that zoo.

959
00:59:36,661 --> 00:59:39,983
我还算什么朋友? 很糟糕吧
What kind of a friend does that make me? Pretty lousy friend I guess.

960
00:59:41,463 --> 00:59:45,780
我只想告诉你 你是百万里挑一的
Well I just want you to know that...you're one in a million.

961
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,781
讲得真好 太让人感动了
Isn't this touching? This is touching.

962
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,588
拜托你转过身来 我想当面对你说
So could you please turn around so I can tell you that to your face?

963
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:58,463
没错 找到你了 我看见了
That's right. Got you. I see you in there.

964
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,952
对 就是你
Yeah yeah you. That's right you, right there.

965
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:05,083
第12排 左手边第203个
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.

966
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:08,910
马蒂 找到了 我知道那是你
I see you Marty. I know it's you.

967
01:00:11,196 --> 01:00:13,524
你知道是什么让你那么特殊吗?
You know what makes you special?

968
01:00:13,573 --> 01:00:15,899
这些家伙是白底黑条
These guys...They're white with black stripes.

969
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,864
你是黑底白条
You're black with white stripes.

970
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:21,637
你是个梦想家 一直都是
You're a dreamer Marty. Always have been.

971
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:24,194
音乐方面很有品位
You have a great taste in music and...

972
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:26,304
朋友方面就不怎么样
horrible taste in friends.

973
01:00:26,728 --> 01:00:29,645
格洛丽娅 梅尔曼不算 就是我而已
Not Melman and Gloria, me.

974
01:00:32,246 --> 01:00:33,554
好 算我一个
OK. I'm in.

975
01:00:33,556 --> 01:00:35,726
不行 马蒂 你不能去
No Marty. You can't come with me.

976
01:00:35,742 --> 01:00:37,959
我不信你还有选择
I don't believe you have a choice.

977
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:57,515
有水吗?
Any water?

978
01:00:57,517 --> 01:00:59,965
没有 只有更多的钻石和金块
No, just more diamonds and gold.

979
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:07,410
好吧 别放弃
OK. Don't give up hope.

980
01:01:07,411 --> 01:01:10,078
大家都听着 我可以帮你们
Listen up. I'll help you.

981
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:13,256
只有一个方法能弄到珍贵的水源
There is only one way to get your precious water.

982
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,586
我 你们爱戴的国王朱利安
I, your beloved King Julien,

983
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:19,706
将无私地用我的好朋友
must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends,

984
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:23,513
祭祀水神们 地点就在...
water gods.

985
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,259
在火山里
In the volcano.

986
01:01:28,413 --> 01:01:29,623
要做什么?
What does that do?

987
01:01:29,674 --> 01:01:32,196
要做什么? 真是个好问题
What does that do? Excellent question.

988
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:35,731
我的祭祀贡品跳入岩浆
My sacrifice goes into volcano.

989
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:40,078
友好的水神吃掉贡品
Then the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

990
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,501
好吃 谢谢你的贡品
Mmm.. Very nice. Thank you for the sacrifice.

991
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:43,799
要不再来一个
Please have another sacrifice.

992
01:01:43,815 --> 01:01:45,485
不了 今天的量够了
No, I've had enough for the day.

993
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:47,692
如果你不再来一个 我会很难...
Listen, I'm gonna be very unsettled unless you will have another...

994
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:50,188
我不想再吃了 行吗
I don't want another sacrifice, OK?

995
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,716
你看看你 这么瘦
Look at you, you look skinny.

996
01:01:51,732 --> 01:01:54,009
我吃饱了 明白了吗
No, I think I've had enough, is that clear?

997
01:01:56,084 --> 01:01:58,313
水神吃掉贡品后
The gods eat the sacrifice,

998
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:01,589
他们会很感激 就会给我一些水
they are grateful, they give me some of their water.

999
01:02:01,637 --> 01:02:04,595
- 然后我把水给你们 - 什么?
- Then I give it to you. - What?

1000
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,705
- 真能行吗 - 不 我是说 当然能
- Does it work?  - No. I mean yes.

1001
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:10,900
是吧 莫里斯
Well, Maurice?

1002
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:13,279
一半一半啦
Yeah, it's fifty fifty.

1003
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,366
好极了
Excellent.

1004
01:02:19,294 --> 01:02:22,978
现在只要找一个动物 自愿跳进岩浆
Now, all I  need is someone who'd like to go in the volcano and...

1005
01:02:22,979 --> 01:02:25,428
做水神的食物
get eaten by gods.

1006
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:30,011
有人自愿去吗 有人举手吗 我需要个志愿者
Any hands? Hands? Anybody? OK. I need someone...

1007
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:32,246
像是从来都没人爱的
perhaps who has never fall in love.

1008
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:37,262
他可以直视死亡 成为真正的英雄
Who could look death, straight in the eye ball. A real genuine hero.

1009
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,494
- 我来 - 梅尔曼?
- I'll do it. - Melman?

1010
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:52,167
快点 在我们恢复理智以前
Hurry up. Before you all come to your senses.

1011
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,864
梅尔曼 你到底有什么问题?
Melman, what is wrong with you?

1012
01:02:55,913 --> 01:02:57,366
我反正都要死了
I'm dying anyways.

1013
01:02:57,367 --> 01:03:00,850
只要有机会为你找到水 就值得
If there is a chance, it'll get you water, it'll be worthy.

1014
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,677
你傻了吗?
Are you nuts?

1015
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:05,080
格洛丽娅 我想告诉你 我们在动物园的时候
Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo...

1016
01:03:05,104 --> 01:03:10,220
不是医生或处方让我生存 而一直是你
it was never the doctors or the prescriptions that kept me going...it was always you.

1017
01:03:11,361 --> 01:03:13,810
只要能天天看到你
Seeing you every day.

1018
01:03:13,844 --> 01:03:16,169
那就是我活着的动力
That's what kept me going.

1019
01:03:19,437 --> 01:03:21,905
梅尔曼 等等
Melman, wait.

1020
01:03:30,204 --> 01:03:32,678
你要一天到晚都拉着这张脸么
You gonna mop around like this all day?

1021
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:36,486
别冲我哼 听我说 祖巴
Don't hmph me. Listen Zuba.

1022
01:03:36,656 --> 01:03:41,283
奇迹已经发生了 我们的孩子回到了我们的身边
A miracle happened. Our son has come back to us.

1023
01:03:42,188 --> 01:03:45,793
- 难道这还不够吗? - 你想说什么 女人
- How come, that is not good enough for you? - What are you saying woman?

1024
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:49,315
我们已经失去他一次了 祖巴
We've lost him once Zuba.

1025
01:03:49,316 --> 01:03:51,207
别再失去第二次了
Let's not lose him again.

1026
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:02,798
祖巴
Zuba!

1027
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,811
- 祖巴 - 走开
- Zuba. - Get out of here.

1028
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:08,400
- 你想干什么 麻昆加? - 糟糕了
- What do you want Makunga? - It's awful.

1029
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,904
水塘水全干了
The watering hole is dried up.

1030
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:12,922
全干了 那不可能
Dried up? That's impossible.

1031
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:15,046
一滴都不剩
There is nothing left.

1032
01:04:15,095 --> 01:04:18,756
你是领头狮子 麻昆加 你打算怎么做
Well, you are the alpha lion Makunga. What are you gonna do about it?

1033
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:23,023
你儿子艾力提说他能解决 他离开保护区了
Your son, Alakay. He said he could fix it. He has gone up river.

1034
01:04:23,049 --> 01:04:24,745
- 离开保护区了? - 不
- Off the reserve? - No!

1035
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:27,729
我试图把他拦下 我跟他说这简直是自杀
I tried to stop him. I told him it was suicide...

1036
01:04:27,753 --> 01:04:30,389
可他说他要证明给你看
but he was determined to prove himself to you.

1037
01:04:31,149 --> 01:04:33,913
你在这等着 说不定他会回来
You stay here in case he comes back.

1038
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:39,060
赶快 祖巴!
Hurry Zuba.

1039
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:43,805
太感动了
I'm so parched.

1040
01:04:48,908 --> 01:04:52,101
这地方就是为了吓人才存在的么
Is this place, aren't affright you out?

1041
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,429
悄悄的 把问题解决了
We'll slip in, find the problem.

1042
01:04:54,431 --> 01:04:56,341
猎人永远也不会发现我们来过这儿
Hunters'll never know we were here.

1043
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:58,625
为什么做这件事的是我们?
Why are "we" doing this?

1044
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:02,216
听着 马蒂 说不定我老爸他会...
Look, Marty maybe my dad'll think that I'm...

1045
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:04,835
我只想证明 我是真正的狮子
I just wanna show him, I'm a real lion.

1046
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:07,671
而不是巧克力狮子?
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

1047
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,559
我知道这很难让人相信
I know this might sound hard to believe,

1048
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:13,613
但是很明显 狮子们是不跳舞的
but apparently lions don't dance.

1049
01:05:13,638 --> 01:05:15,654
什么?!
What?

1050
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:17,735
至少我老爸这样想
As far as my dad's concerned.

1051
01:05:17,737 --> 01:05:20,477
人类可认为你是跳舞天才
As far as the people is concerned, you're a huge hit.

1052
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:23,628
那是纽约 这是非洲 要求更严苛
That was New York. This is Africa. It's a much tougher crowd.

1053
01:05:23,637 --> 01:05:26,011
马蒂 马蒂 就是这里
Marty, Marty. This's it.

1054
01:05:26,704 --> 01:05:28,118
被堵上的水源
This is the clog.

1055
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:29,419
快来
Come on.

1056
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:38,616
找到水了
Here's the water.

1057
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,742
马蒂 低头 看那边
Marty, stay down. Look at that.

1058
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:47,129
那个女人
It's her.

1059
01:05:47,178 --> 01:05:48,778
- 这样对吗 - 做得很好
- Is this right? - Oh, very good.

1060
01:05:48,827 --> 01:05:50,038
娜娜 讲慢点

1061
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,700
你还没上手是吧

1062
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,672
我们需要炸药 你有炸药吗
We need dynamite, do you have any dynamite?

1063
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:02,384
哦 糟糕 我今早刚用完最后一根火柴
Oh, snap, I just used my last...

1064
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:07,068
快走

1065
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,078
我不想死

1066
01:06:09,126 --> 01:06:12,351
- 快快 - 曲折盘旋

1067
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,636
不不

1068
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:15,503
曲折盘旋

1069
01:06:15,553 --> 01:06:18,341
不

1070
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:21,737
艾力克斯?
Alex!

1071
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:24,461
- 快跑 马蒂 - 我不能把你丢在这
- Run Marty. - Come on, I can't leave you here.

1072
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:29,254
快跑 去叫救兵
Go, get help.

1073
01:06:36,675 --> 01:06:40,967
好了
OK.

1074
01:06:41,574 --> 01:06:43,902
好吧
OK. OK...

1075
01:06:52,586 --> 01:06:55,277
来吧 没问题的
OK. Here we go. OK...

1076
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,945
好吧 好吧
Here we go. Here we go.

1077
01:07:02,294 --> 01:07:03,860
为什么跳舞呀
What is all the hoop about?

1078
01:07:03,862 --> 01:07:06,190
- 乔 - 乔 巫医吗?
- Joe? -Joe, the witch doctor?

1079
01:07:06,215 --> 01:07:08,760
- 我们还以为你死了 - 我也以为是这样
- We thought you were dead. - So did I.

1080
01:07:08,786 --> 01:07:11,478
后来我想明白 我本来就全身褐斑
Then I realized, I'm covered in brown spots.

1081
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:14,216
那梅尔曼不会死
So, Melman's not dying.

1082
01:07:14,896 --> 01:07:18,704
- 梅尔曼不会死 - 借过 让让 梅尔曼
- Melman's not dying. - Excuse me, excuse me. Melman!

1083
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:20,425
让开
Move out.

1084
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:21,784
别往下跳
Don't do this.

1085
01:07:21,808 --> 01:07:24,063
朱利安 停下 这太疯狂了
Julien, stop this. This's crazy!

1086
01:07:24,112 --> 01:07:29,289
让长颈鹿跳下岩浆来求水 太疯狂了
Oh, certainly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy.

1087
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:31,460
是的
Yes!

1088
01:07:32,964 --> 01:07:36,168
求你了 梅尔曼 别跳!
Please, Melman stop.

1089
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,226
- 格洛丽娅? - 你不能那么做
- Gloria? - You can't do this.

1090
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:40,651
- 为什么不能? - 因为 啊
- Why not? - Because I...

1091
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,315
- 你不能这么做 - 首先 这真的很痛啊!
- You can't do this Melman. - First of all, it hurts.

1092
01:08:03,594 --> 01:08:06,948
第二 我反正只有18小时活了
Second of all, I'll only have eighteen hours to live anyway.

1093
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:09,559
梅尔曼 我必须要知道
Melman, I gotto know.

1094
01:08:10,602 --> 01:08:13,560
你说的那些话都是认真的吗?
Did you really mean all those things you said about me?

1095
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:15,911
当然是
Of course I did.

1096
01:08:15,913 --> 01:08:17,271
这太疯狂了
This is crazy.

1097
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,476
是吗?
It is?

1098
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:24,570
太疯狂了 我环游世界半圈
It's crazy in the thing, I had to go half way around the world...

1099
01:08:25,178 --> 01:08:28,402
才发现真命天子
to find out that the perfect guy for me...

1100
01:08:28,403 --> 01:08:30,100
一直就在我隔壁
lived right next door.

1101
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:33,471
我猜你说的是你和我 邻居
Then I guess it's you and me neighbor...

1102
01:08:33,497 --> 01:08:36,284
一起度过接下来的18小时
you and me for the next eighteen hours.

1103
01:08:36,285 --> 01:08:38,758
不过多久 我会一直陪着你
I'll take whatever you got.

1104
01:08:42,939 --> 01:08:46,422
- 莫里斯 事情怎么变这样? - 我相信 这胖女士有灵魂
- Maurice, what just happened? - I believe the fat lady has sobbed.

1105
01:08:46,472 --> 01:08:48,896
- 这里发生什么事了? - 嘿 马蒂?
- Hey, what's going on here?  - Marty. Hey!

1106
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:53,441
听着 艾力克斯遇到了大麻烦 我们得立刻去救他
Listen up. Alex is in big trouble. We get to get up the river fast.

1107
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,880
- 用飞机吧 - 好主意 快来
- What about the plane? - Perfect. Come on.

1108
01:08:58,402 --> 01:09:02,188
我们不会继续修飞机 除非你答应一切条件
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.

1109
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:04,172
现在 关于产假...
Now, about maternity leave.

1110
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:07,666
产假? 你是个男人啊
Maternity leave? You're males.

1111
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:10,139
听着 我们得用飞机去救人
Look, we need a plane for rescue mission.

1112
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,760
不把工会摆平 什么都做不成
Well, there is nothing I can do until we bust up this union.

1113
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:16,616
不让用飞机 我就把你们都摆平
I'm gonna get the busty not bully you if you don't get this plane going.

1114
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:19,840
你没发现我也焦头烂额吗
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here?

1115
01:09:19,841 --> 01:09:21,732
不许有产假
No maternity leave.

1116
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:28,200
可能有某人不希望 让这些照片流传在外呢
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savannah.

1117
01:09:37,664 --> 01:09:40,673
行了 你休你的产假吧
All right, you get your maternity leave.

1118
01:09:41,654 --> 01:09:43,767
总算好了
Finally.

1119
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,761
我们要去哪里? 发生了什么事?
Where are you headed? What's going on? Where are we going?

1120
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:53,914
哦 不 不要把我放到火上
Oh no, please. You are not gonna burn me there.

1121
01:09:53,963 --> 01:09:56,830
不 别这样
No, no, no. This's wrong.

1122
01:09:56,841 --> 01:10:00,186
看 你们都是幸存者
You see? You are survivals.

1123
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,447
现在 想不想吃烤狮子?
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

1124
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,257
你不能吃狮子
We can't eat a lion.

1125
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:08,157
别担心 吃起来像是鸡肉 快来
Don't worry, taste like chicken.

1126
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,302
不 别听她瞎说
No, no, no, no. Don't listen to her.

1127
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:13,825
她神智不清醒 同志们
She is out of her mind. People.

1128
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:17,243
我也是从纽约来的
I'm from New York City too.

1129
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:20,753
是我呀 中央公园的狮子艾力克斯
It's me, Alex the lion. From Central Park.

老爸?

1131
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:33,488
你想什么呢 你根本无能力存活
What were you thinking son? You got no matter be not here.

1132
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:37,567
好了 你躲到我身后
This's it, I want you to stay behind.

1133
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:40,842
不 爸爸 他们是纽约人 都是胆小怕事的人
Look dad, they're New Yorkers, they are just...ruined and frightened people.

1134
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:43,023
躲到后面
Stay back.

1135
01:10:43,025 --> 01:10:45,110
别让他们跑了
Are you gonna let them get away?

1136
01:10:51,075 --> 01:10:52,699
你在干什么 儿子?
What are you doing son?

1137
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,058
做我唯一会做的事
The only thing I know how to do.

1138
01:11:05,966 --> 01:11:09,069
这些舞蹈动作 是艾力克斯?
Hey, all those moves... Alex?

1139
01:11:12,054 --> 01:11:16,104
- 是艾力克斯 那只狮子 - 中央公园那只
- This is Alex the lion. - From Central Park. This is Alex.

只有一只狮子能这么跳舞
Only one lion can move like that.

1141
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:27,420
- 真棒 - 简直不能相信

1142
01:11:33,612 --> 01:11:36,349
他是怎么做到的?
How does he do that?

1143
01:11:49,061 --> 01:11:51,874
- 老爸 你在干嘛? - 和我儿子一起跳舞

Oh, that was beautiful.

1148
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,173
好了 该开伙了
Now, let's eat.

1149

弄垮水坝 传话上去

艾力克斯想弄垮水坝

- Oh, I like this song. - It never gets old.

1166
01:13:22,337 --> 01:13:26,358
确实很琅琅上口 掉头 降低
It does have a catchy hook.

1167
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:38,920
往上飞 要不然我们死定了
Tell them, no, pull up. She will kill us.

01:13:38,922 --> 01:13:41,856
肯定有别的路可走 传话上去
There is gotto be another way. Pass it on.

1169

他说不要往上飞

- 没有其它路了 传话上去 - 你确定?
- There is no other way. Pass it on. - Are you sure?

1171
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:55,703
别人牺牲才是最伟大的

坏猫咪们
Bad kitties.

1176
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:23,932
不知道为什么祭祀不起作用
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.

1177
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:27,156

1179

你知道 我对吹口哨不在行

别挡着我的路
Out of my way.

1190

看看 看看
Well, well, well, well, well.

1191
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:16,944
