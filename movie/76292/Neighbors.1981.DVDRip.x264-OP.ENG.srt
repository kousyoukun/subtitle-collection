1
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,158
Stay with us for
blood-chilling suspense...

2
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,118
... blackmail, murder,
intrigue and love.

3
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,236
Next on Channel 8.

4
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,868
- A tourist, visiting a friend,
was struck...

5
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,350
... by a 30-pound block as he
walk ed down the stage-door alley.

6
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,114
The cinder block hit me
on the flat side...

7
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,794
... of the block itself,
as if it were hurled at me.

8
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,155
- When the ferry dock ed,
he was napping.

9
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,472
A deck hand wok e him and told him
to drive off. But Max was in reverse.

10
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,712
He went right off the back of the ferry.
He drowned.

11
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,077
But if you were complaining
about the weather this week end...

12
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,674
... it could have been worse.
A series of floods...

13
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,308
- I guess it's that time.
- You want any help?

14
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,236
There was a terrific recipe for capon
in the Times today.

15
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,716
Takes two minutes.

16
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,991
The National Guard has been
called out...

17
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,071
... and some people may have to...

18
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,837
Enid, someone's moving into
the Warren place.

19
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,513
So?

20
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,955
It's a funny time to be moving.

21
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,795
I don't see any kids' stuff.

22
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,559
Thank God.

23
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,718
Maybe we should ask them over
for a drink tonight.

24
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,037
- It being their first night and all.
- Tomorrow will be fine.

25
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,395
Well, tomorrow's not tonight,
you know.

26
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,597
- And it would be nice.
- There's plenty of time to be nice.

27
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,751
You don't have to push it.

28
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,669
I think they've got a dog.

29
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,196
Kalinqashe, the dog spirit,
is swift and faithful.

30
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,558
I don't care. I don't want him
in my garden digging up my bulbs.

31
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,838
Who would want your bulbs?

32
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,471
Hello.

33
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,916
- What can I do for you?
- Anything you like.

34
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,992
The question is,
what do you want in return?

35
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,435
Hi. I'm Ramona.
I just moved in next door.

36
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,558
- Oh, really?
- Really.

37
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,591
Who's this?

38
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,833
- Your girlfriend?
- No, that's my daughter, Elaine.

39
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,270
That's a hot one.

40
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,749
By the way, my name is Earl Keese.

41
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,634
I was real friendly
with a boy named Earl once.

42
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,709
Well, twice really.

43
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,600
So you're all moved in next door, huh?

44
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,911
It's a very good house. I imagine
you'll want to freshen it up.

45
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,071
Give it a new coat of paint,
mow the lawn.

46
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,719
Is your wife here?

47
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,513
She's in the kitchen.

48
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,633
- She's dying to meet you. I'll get her.
- No, no, I don't want to meet her.

49
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,234
I hope we're gonna be friends.

50
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,151
We were very friendly
with the Warrens next door.

51
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,431
But we werert that close.

52
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,756
I mean, we were next-door close.

53
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,875
I didn't mean that kind of close.
I mean "close" close.

54
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,192
Is your wife making dinner?

55
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,310
She's fixing a great capon.

56
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,869
It was in the Times today.

57
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,351
Would you like to stay for dinner?

58
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,875
Are there more of you?

59
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,310
Is there a Mr. Ramona?

60
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,994
You go ask your wife if it's okay.

61
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,794
No, it's no problem, really.

62
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,518
Don't argue with me, Earl.

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,673
You wouldn't want me
to have to pull down your pants...

64
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,353
...and spank your little buns...

65
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,073
...would you?

66
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,394
Don't you go away. I'll be right back.

67
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,633
Okay?

68
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,874
- How many frozen waffles you want?
- Waffles? What happened to the capon?

69
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,871
- What capon?
- You said you read...

70
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,396
...an incredible recipe for it.
- I didn't say we were having it.

71
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,955
Leave it to you
to take something for granted.

72
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,997
Frozen waffles is all we've got.

73
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,870
Werert you gonna pick up steaks
for tomorrow?

74
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,598
You're asking for steak?

75
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,069
You could have picked up
some cheap ones.

76
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,470
I will not eat cheap meat.

77
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,593
No! No!

78
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
- May I help you?
- Hi, Earl. I'm Vic.

79
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,719
I'm sure Ramona's already told you
my whole life story.

80
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,873
- No, but you must be her...
- That's me, like it or not.

81
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,510
If you know what I mean. Have a seat.

82
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,438
So, what do you say, neighbour?

83
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,149
Welcome to the end of the road,
I guess.

84
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,873
- It's a great house.
- Thank you.

85
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,715
I mean mine. More rooms than we
need, really, but I couldn't resist.

86
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,949
It was a steal.

87
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,111
What's on the menu, pal?
I'm starved.

88
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,835
We havert eaten all day. We could eat
a baby's butt through a park bench.

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,072
I'm afraid I spoke too soon earlier.

90
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,118
We havert got enough.
Enid didn't get to her shopping today.

91
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,874
Well, no sweat.
I'll just go and get some takeout.

92
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,077
There's nothing around here
except the standard burgers...

93
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,118
...greasy dogs and a gummy pizza.
- I can do better than that.

94
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,794
You just leave everything
to Captain Vic.

95
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,957
Look, friend, if I do the running,
I know you'll wanna spring for the tab.

96
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,119
Okay.

97
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,636
Thirty bucks?
For four grown people?

98
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,554
Where have you been? It takes
30 bucks just to look at a menu.

99
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,879
- This is a $2 bill.
- Let me see that.

100
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,156
Gee, I thought it was a 20.

101
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,791
- Really.
- Well, people palm them off that way.

102
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,157
You never know who's gonna
stick it to you, do you, Earl?

103
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,233
Look, if 32 bucks isn't enough,
we can always do it some other night.

104
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,233
Why don't we do it now.
Let's have your car keys, okay?

105
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,119
- My car keys?
- Yeah, my brakes are shot.

106
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,670
Why don't I get the food? I'm the one
who's supposed to be neighbourly.

107
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,434
You stay here and my wife
will keep you company.

108
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,872
Forget it. If you insist on paying for
dinner, the least I can do is go get it.

109
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,629
What I don't understand
is where you're going.

110
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,597
There's no place decent around here.

111
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,150
If you must know, it's a new place,
opened up on the other side of town.

112
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,118
Near the train station.
Across from the warehouse.

113
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,838
Italian.

114
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,032
I commute, I go by there twice a day,
five days a week...

115
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,555
...and I've never seen
a restaurant around there.

116
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,757
You calling me a liar?

117
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,512
No, I...

118
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,388
I'm just not very observant,
I guess.

119
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,472
I can't blame you.
They don't have their sign up yet.

120
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,315
But it's got a cute name:
Caesar's Garlic Wars.

121
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,474
Okay. Why don't you
get some ravioli...

122
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,279
...and some... What do you
call those stuffed clams?

123
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,036
- Stuffed clams.
- Yeah. And some scampi and garlic.

124
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,112
Whatever I get, Earl,
I first have to get going.

125
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,077
I'll get the keys.

126
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,520
Why don't you stay here
and make yourself at home.

127
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,636
I'll be right here.

128
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,958
Hi.

129
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,397
Took a bath. There's a dead rat
in our tub over there.

130
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,876
Vic said not to move it.

131
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,075
Took a pill. Moving always makes me
kind of hyper.

132
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,591
I hope you don't mind.

133
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,236
Yeah. Sure. I don't mind.

134
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,630
Oh, you do mind, don't you?

135
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,155
Vic's going out for Italian food.

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,154
You come down and join us
whenever you can, okay?

137
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,515
What are you so nervous about, Earl?

138
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,400
Afraid Vic will think you're up here...

139
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,511
...chewing me?

140
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,113
What are you doing? Robbing me?

141
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,999
Looking for a pencil to write down
what you want for supper.

142
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,559
You got a pencil in your hand.

143
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,678
$327. Is that all you had
at the end of last month?

144
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,434
That's none of your business.
Stay out of there, please.

145
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,559
- I just wanted to get the order right.
- Why don't we go downstairs.

146
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,079
Sure.

147
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,992
After you.

148
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,075
- So, what do you want?
- Make it simple.

149
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,835
Spaghetti, meatballs, a salad.
Whatever you want for you and...

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,389
What's not simple
is how I get to the restaurant.

151
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,120
- Use my car.
- Has it got a key or a rubber band...

152
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,555
...you wind up?
- Why don't I go with you.

153
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,837
Afraid I'll steal your car?
That's why I moved in next door?

154
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,798
So I could rip off your car
and move somewhere else?

155
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,639
- There you go.
- Back in a flash, pal.

156
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,630
Waffles are browning.
Always a thrilling sight.

157
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,631
Good news, Enid.

158
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,354
Italian food is on the way.

159
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,399
You arranged it?

160
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,313
Well, more or less.
I invited the neighbours.

161
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,277
Oh, you met them.

162
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,319
What did you think?

163
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,869
Earl?

164
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,519
They're...

165
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,072
...different.

166
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,796
I guess I'll go up and get dressed.

167
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,679
Upstairs?

168
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,353
What for?

169
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,633
You said they were coming over.

170
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,268
Well, they're not dressing.
They're barely dressed.

171
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,672
I mean, you could go
in the kitchen and set the table.

172
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,196
And turn the waffles off.
I'll be there in a minute to help you.

173
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,999
You got lots to do down here.

174
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,754
Yeah, there is something I forgot to do.

175
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,753
That's a boy.
You want some steak?

176
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,159
Don't tell me, you must be
our new neighbour. Come on in.

177
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,276
Thanks a lot.

178
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,711
Someone's stolen our truck...

179
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,189
...and I need to use the phone
to call the police.

180
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,477
Use the phone in the kitchen.
What a terrible thing, your first day.

181
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,279
It's even worse than just that.
Baby was in the back.

182
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,318
- Oh, my.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

183
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,438
Vic. Your baby's drowning!

184
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,068
No chance.
Why should my dog be drowning?

185
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,239
Dog?

186
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,634
I thought "child."

187
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,633
We havert any children.
Unless Ramona just pumped one out...

188
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,633
...and didn't tell me.
She calls the dog "Baby."

189
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,234
- She calls the dog "Baby"?
- Yeah. He's fine.

190
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,914
I just saw him around the back there.
When I drove up.

191
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,275
He's digging up something
in your flowerbed.

192
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,714
My flowerbed?

193
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,119
Hi, Enid.

194
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,197
Hi, Vic.

195
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,913
Oh, we met hours ago.

196
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,514
Earl here was worried about Baby.

197
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,399
Oh, he's no trouble at all.
He's a perfect gentleman.

198
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,348
- Leave him with me any time you want.
- Don't worry, I will.

199
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,914
They spoil him awfully.

200
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,959
I want him to have every advantage
I was denied as a young dog.

201
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,588
Well, here are your keys, Mr. Keese.

202
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,595
Let's dig into this stuff
before the sauce turns into penicillin.

203
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,789
Why don't you look for Ramona.

204
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,512
- Me?
- Finders keepers, Earl. After all...

205
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,240
...I know what goes on out here
in the suburbs.

206
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,756
That's why we moved here.

207
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,073
Oh, Vic.

208
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,678
- What do you think, Earl?
- Don't do that. You are outrageous.

209
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,309
Too bad about Vic's truck, Earl.

210
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,755
Well, I was just pushing it
into my garage...

211
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,514
...to hide it from him, you know,
kind of a joke.

212
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,478
- It was an accident.
- It could happen to anybody.

213
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,671
I think 1500 should take care of it.

214
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,308
Fifteen hundred? Dollars?

215
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,559
It was just a joke. I mean, I'm sure
your insurance will cover most of it...

216
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,678
...and I'll pay the deductible.
What is it, 100 or so?

217
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,356
For the truck.
Keeping me quiet is a little extra.

218
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,152
I don't believe it.

219
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,759
You're blackmailing me.

220
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,354
Hey, what are neighbours for?

221
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,836
Oh, make it cash.

222
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,717
Hey, come on in, buddy.
Help yourself.

223
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,674
Well, here we all are.

224
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,354
To Vic and Ramona.

225
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,114
For bringing a breath of fresh air
to our neighbourhood.

226
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,795
May we have many, many years
of your lovely company.

227
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,552
Do they have any country fairs here?

228
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,633
Where they do things like see
which bull has the biggest balls?

229
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,511
This isn't really country. It's more
a suburban bedroom community.

230
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,672
The locals are in service trades.
They're not farmers.

231
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,711
Maybe we can measure their balls.

232
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,798
Or we could start with yours,
if you like.

233
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,148
Good, is it?

234
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,674
- Delicious.
- I must call Caesar's...

235
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,398
...and compliment the chef.

236
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,194
Tell me, were they crowded
this evening?

237
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,913
- What?
- Caesar's.

238
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,389
Friday night, the only place in town.

239
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,233
Bet they were turning them away
in droves.

240
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,516
Okay, you probably
called the place...

241
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,319
...and found out they're not open
for business yet, right?

242
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,799
Right.

243
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,350
So does that make me a liar?

244
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,590
Maybe I got there,
saw the place was closed...

245
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,876
...and went somewhere else
to pick up the food.

246
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,759
Where? Everything's shut at this hour.
Everything.

247
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,433
- And the wine?
- What's the matter?

248
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,512
Vic brings a wonderful dinner
and you give him the third degree.

249
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,910
I don't mind.
There's no mystery about it.

250
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,436
You know Valley Field Mall on Route 3?
Across from the Cinema Cineplex?

251
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,074
There's a small spaghetti and wine
dealership there.

252
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,753
Next to the Singer Sewing Centre.

253
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,559
That's where you got it?

254
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,393
That's right.

255
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,520
Well, to begin with,
Valley Field Mall is closed.

256
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,353
When it was open, it was
on Route 15, not Route 3.

257
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,829
And there can't be
a small spaghetti dealership...

258
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,594
...next to the Singer Centre
across from the cineplex...

259
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,038
...because there is no cineplex
and there is no Singer Sewing Centre.

260
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,958
All right, I can deceive you no longer.

261
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,071
Yes, yes, yes, I admit it.

262
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,117
It was me who prepared this meal...

263
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,078
...to share on our
first night together as neighbours.

264
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,348
This was my crime. Mixing up
a special batch of my Aunt Minota's...

265
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,829
...secret, sacred spaghetti sauce.

266
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,270
Sorry I messed up your evening. Right?

267
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,919
Right.

268
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,352
In light of Earl's feelings,
I think it would be best if we left.

269
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,878
Oh, no, no. Sit down, sit down.
Let's finish this magnificent meal.

270
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,713
Don't worry about Earl.
He'll get over his feelings.

271
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,839
- He spurned my sauce.
- No, he loves your sauce.

272
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,991
He's just jealous, he can't cook.

273
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,317
Earl, isn't it your turn
to do a little confessing?

274
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,400
- What?
- Vic's been man enough to admit...

275
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,791
...he was the one who cooked supper.
You've got nothing to say?

276
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,393
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We do have an agreement, don't we?

277
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,917
I'm talking about what you did outside.

278
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,391
Yes, Ramona. I know and I accept
the figures you mentioned.

279
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,270
"Figures," Earl? What "figures"?

280
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,989
Just a little arrangement
I have with Ramona.

281
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,316
What sort of arrangement?

282
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,239
Oh, boy.

283
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,789
We're waiting.
Or do I have to pound it out of you?

284
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,030
Don't speak to me like that
in my own house.

285
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,271
- Why would I?
- You just did.

286
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,671
- It's just a something a guy says.
- I never say it.

287
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,314
- I don't blame you.
- Ramona...

288
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,717
...why don't you be man enough
to tell us since Earl isn't.

289
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,518
He tried to pork me.

290
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,112
Pork you? What?!

291
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,072
You know you did.

292
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,435
I swear, I never touched her.

293
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,074
Well, I wasn't born
with your hand in my bush.

294
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,751
Enid, help me.

295
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,593
Tell them I couldn't
do something like that.

296
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,555
- Let's leave that to the police.
- Vic, she's not my type.

297
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,634
Enid, you tell Earl he'll have
a chance to defend himself.

298
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,508
I think you can see
why we have to leave.

299
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,553
I know you meant well.
Didrt you?

300
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,315
We might have had
a wonderful relationship.

301
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,994
But then, as Arthur Bremer once said:

302
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,952
"How many things go right
in this crazy world?"

303
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,710
Ramona, let's go.

304
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,358
Come on, before he gets dangerous.

305
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,872
- I thought I'd be able to defend myself!
- Not so loud, Earl.

306
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,510
Afraid we'll disturb the neighbours?
These are the goddamn neighbours!

307
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,194
Calm yourself, Earl.
I'm not gonna take you to court.

308
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,318
That would make for bad blood.
We don't want any bad blood...

309
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,792
... especially since we'll be living
next door to you for a long, long time.

310
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,475
I swear to God, Enid,
we may have to move.

311
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,312
They're very strange people.

312
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,040
You know how after five minutes
when you meet someone...

313
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,792
...you know everything about them?

314
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,599
What they do, their last name.
We know nothing about them.

315
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,877
- So what?
- So why didn't you say something?

316
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,508
You were in the house the whole time
she was here.

317
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,240
Besides, you know how long it takes
to pork someone?

318
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,630
No, how long does it take, Earl?

319
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,030
Are you saying you believe her?

320
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,873
Enid, I'm the same man
you've known for 16 years.

321
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,952
I know.

322
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,236
What the hell's going on around here?

323
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,755
He comes waltzing in
and you say, "Hi, Vic."

324
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,390
- How did you know his name?
- He came over this afternoon.

325
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,591
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

326
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,275
- You could've told me in the car.
- You know we never talk in the car.

327
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,317
Today you could've made an exception.

328
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,916
That house next door is empty
for six months and you meet...

329
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,197
...the new occupants before I do,
and you don't say anything?

330
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,318
- Enid, am I being unreasonable?
- Pass the wine.

331
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,877
Did you tell me everybody
you met today?

332
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,793
I didn't meet anyone today.
I never meet anyone.

333
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,394
A new neighbour's
a bit different, isn't it?

334
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,835
A new neighbour whose unit
we can stare at.

335
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,197
- I wasn't staring at his unit.
- I saw you, Enid.

336
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,591
I don't care what other wives do,
only the one I'm married to.

337
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,035
I know when a womars
checking out a mars unit.

338
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,431
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, Vic's wife, that Ramona.

339
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,398
She did it to me, practically
unzipped my fly with her eyes.

340
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,959
And you hated it, right?

341
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,032
How many stiff nips
did you check out at the office today?

342
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,749
I know you, Earl, your eyes
never sit still for a minute.

343
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,071
Why'd you give their dog our steak?

344
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,390
I saw you, behind my back.

345
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,393
I was afraid you wouldn't approve.

346
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,393
You were afraid right,
I can tell you that.

347
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,958
What could I do?

348
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,270
Vic asked me
to look after Baby for a while.

349
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,035
But steak? Jesus, why didn't you
stuff money into his mouth?

350
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,156
And 32 bucks for this load of crap?

351
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,356
It's his money.

352
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,555
Baby! Oh, my God! Baby!

353
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,836
Get that thing away from that thing!

354
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,588
What happened?

355
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,638
Baby was over by that thing
taking a leak.

356
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,716
Jesus Christ.

357
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,235
Come, Baby. Come.

358
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,759
Come here. Come here.

359
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,317
He's all right.

360
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,113
Sweetie, where's the truck?

361
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,748
Maybe that thing got our truck
like Earl got me.

362
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,878
Relax with that stuff. Our boy here
has been through enough.

363
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,794
We really had you going there.
Ramona's such an imp.

364
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,873
We were just kind of putting you on
at supper. Like a little joke.

365
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,828
A joke? You call accusing me
of porking Ramona a joke?

366
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,276
Oh, what's the matter with you, Earl?
Can't you take a joke?

367
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,558
Let's go, Ramona, come in the house.
It's Friday night. I'll buy you a drink.

368
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,354
Yeah, I can take a joke, Enid!

369
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,994
- Can you take a joke, Vic?
- Any joke you dish up.

370
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,479
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, try me.

371
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,119
- I sank your truck.
- What?

372
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,875
I didn't mean to. I lost control after
I moved the brick from under your tire.

373
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,600
You touched my brick?
I told you I had no brakes.

374
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,830
I borrowed your car for the takeout.

375
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,629
- But you didn't go for takeout.
- Where's my truck and my airplane?

376
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,833
It's down in the swamp.
I'll go get my jacket.

377
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,357
We'll get your jacket later.
You just take me to...

378
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,873
...the swamp.

379
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,555
Give me the light, I'll lead the way.

380
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,280
You're pretty lucky,
having a swamp next to your house.

381
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,953
It didn't always smell this way.

382
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,317
When we moved in, it was a freshwater
lake with fish and everything.

383
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,313
Then the Interstate Chemical
began dumping upstream...

384
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,869
...and weird things started to grow.

385
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,793
I havert been here since the search
party a couple years ago.

386
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,359
Search party?

387
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,351
Yeah.

388
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,200
Some guy disappeared down here.

389
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,837
A lineman from the power company.
Said it was quicksand.

390
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,753
Quicksand, this part of the country?
No way.

391
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,353
That's what I said.

392
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,989
Vic!

393
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,429
Vic!

394
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,914
Vic, help me. Please help me!

395
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,078
Do you feel my truck in there?

396
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,708
Vic, come on, help me.
I'll buy you a new truck.

397
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,759
Not like that one. How about my
triplane? How you gonna replace that?

398
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,238
Help, please.
I'm being sucked down.

399
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,273
- Maybe it's best that way.
- What are you talking about?

400
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,869
You're not the ideal neighbour.
You sank my truck...

401
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,508
...you insulted my sauce
and you violated Ramona.

402
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,917
- You said it was just a joke.
- But she was in your bathtub.

403
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,957
No, she wasn't.
She was in the bed.

404
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,833
And that is where
you saw her mammae.

405
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,838
- Her mammal?
- Her honkers, Earl.

406
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,314
She dropped the towel.

407
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,472
Did she drop it,
or did you psychically will it to fall?

408
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,950
- "Will it to fall"?
- Did you will her towel to fall?

409
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,434
No.

410
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,511
Never. No.

411
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,873
Admit it, Earl.
They'll go easier on you if you do.

412
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,555
Will it to fall?
Well... No, I don't think so.

413
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,113
Come on, Earl.

414
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,752
- Well, maybe a little.
- Come on.

415
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,433
Yes! Yes!

416
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,870
- Okay, I admit it.
- Admit what?

417
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,155
Yes. I willed the towel to fall!

418
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,630
Grab on. Earl Keese, come on up.

419
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,276
See, all I wanted was a little honesty
in our relationship, buddy.

420
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,510
You'd want the
same thing, right, pal?

421
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,798
Vic.

422
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,351
Vic.

423
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,077
Don't kid around.

424
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,433
Come on up. Vic!

425
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,951
Vic, I'm sorry.
Vic, come back, Vic!

426
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,434
Vic, come back.

427
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,919
Forgive me, Vic.

428
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,309
Forgive me.

429
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,032
Oh, my God.

430
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,637
I must be seeing things.

431
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,316
So there was this Indian and...

432
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,714
Oh, God!

433
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,156
Jesus! Get out of here!
Get out!

434
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,556
Get out of my house!

435
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,472
You're certifiable!
You and that woman!

436
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,031
You're nuts!
You're a maniac! Get out!

437
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,388
God, does it always
shrivel up when you shower?

438
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,318
Great.

439
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,074
Now it's your turn
to annoy me, right?

440
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,353
I was looking for Baby. You havert
seen him, have you? He kills chickens.

441
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,878
Well, I don't keep
chickens in the shower.

442
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,149
- This is pretty.
- Please don't touch them.

443
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,238
Put them back on the shelf.

444
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,470
Snippy.

445
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,072
Your left ball
in the corner pocket.

446
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,109
Sorry, Earl.

447
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,112
I started collecting them
when I was 9 years old.

448
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,358
Hey, you kids,
keep it down to a dull roar.

449
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,750
I'm not cleaning up
down there again, Earl.

450
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,672
What's happening, gang?

451
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,839
Hi, Vic.
Come on in and join the party.

452
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,196
I gotta go upstairs, be right back.

453
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,079
I gotta get a broom
to sweep up all this junk.

454
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,912
Get a little rough with you, did he?

455
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,069
Hey!

456
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,159
Earl. Hey, Earl.

457
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,517
- Go to hell. You're not getting back in.
- You locked them in?

458
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,638
They're a couple of cases.
They're fruitcakes, lunatics.

459
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,793
- Both of them. They're hazardous, Enid.
- Enid. You in there, honey?

460
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,476
Right here, Captain Vic.
You can't keep them prisoners, Earl.

461
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,474
I'm gonna call the locksmith.
They can let them out the side door.

462
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,954
Hello, Chic. It's Earl.

463
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,475
- Earl. Earl who?
- No jok es, will you?

464
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,392
I need the name of that locksmith.

465
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,711
I broke a key and I got
two lunatics locked in my basement.

466
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,912
What? What did you say?

467
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,509
- Blow it out your ass.
- Is somebody on this line?

468
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,712
- Just you and me, asshole.
- The bastard's on the phone.

469
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,677
- You called me, didn't you?
- Not you.

470
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,273
- Me.
- Get off the line, Vic.

471
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,873
- Who's Vic?
- He lives next door.

472
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,031
- Nobody lives next door.
- That's right.

473
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,992
- Christ.
- Earl, you been drinking?

474
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,833
- What the hell is going on?
- Never mind, forget it.

475
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,076
And don't ever call here again.

476
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,477
Oh, really, Earl. Grow up.

477
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,270
- Vic, stop!
- Please, you promised me. Please.

478
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,637
- Your leg. Just one leg.
- It's a trick.

479
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,189
You are pitiful, Earl.
How do you know it's a trick?

480
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,319
- You always go limp in a crisis.
- It's not a crisis, it's a trick.

481
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,393
How do you know Vic
isn't an escaped vivisectionist?

482
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,352
A vivisectionist!

483
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,271
Ramona!

484
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,675
Are you still in one piece?

485
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,631
Come on, kids.

486
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,032
Furs fun.

487
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,955
All right. Game's over.

488
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,431
Enid!

489
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,238
Enid!

490
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,552
Greavy's Garage.

491
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,876
I'm sorry to be calling you
at this hour.

492
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,119
It don't matter. We're open 24 hours.
All day, all damn night. What you need?

493
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,633
I'm at number 2 Burt Street.

494
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,913
I need somebody to let me out of my
basement, and a tow truck immediately.

495
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,872
Ain't that damn truck there yet?

496
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,600
I sent my boy Perry out there
five minutes ago.

497
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,995
Some fella named Vic called up.

498
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,594
You're kidding.

499
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,555
Yeah, I'm kidding. I stay up all night
so I can wank my crank on the phone.

500
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,679
Wait a minute.

501
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,229
- He just got here.
- That fella Vic...

502
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,595
... says you run his truck
down the swamp.

503
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,716
Locked him and
his missus in a root cellar.

504
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,235
- It was kind of a joke.
- A joke?

505
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,995
What the hell kind of joke is that?
It's as funny as a gutful of pinworms.

506
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,072
- Who ask ed your opinion?
- Who the hell has to, jack-off?

507
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,669
Just because I lay under
your carpet that's insides...

508
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,479
...and because I snake your pipes
and drain your cesspool...

509
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,076
...don't make me dirt under your feet.
I'm as good as you any day, asshole.

510
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,398
If I didn't have to do this crap for a
living, I wouldn't sell you my snot.

511
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,956
Enid.

512
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,116
It's like a peashooter. I saw a guy
take three slugs from one of these.

513
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,396
- He just kept coming.
- I remember that.

514
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,630
- Be cool, brothers.
- Take it easy, guys.

515
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,439
- You too. Good night.
- Look who's home.

516
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,478
- Our daughter, the outlaw hitchhiker.
- Hi, Daddy.

517
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,394
- Elaine, what are you doing home?
- Got kicked out of school. I'm hungry.

518
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,678
We're gonna party with the neighbours.
Arert they neat? I got some vodka.

519
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,598
- She got kicked out.
- Leave her alone.

520
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,671
Vic, what did you say
is in a pile driver?

521
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,310
Italian Galliano for passion,
Irish Mist for love and...

522
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,597
...Russian vodka for endurance.
- Poor baby. Learn to relax.

523
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,951
Too much excitement's
no good for you.

524
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,318
Why don't you go upstairs,
take a hot bath, get into bed...

525
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,870
...and I'll come up to tuck
you in and help you go to sleep.

526
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,672
That's a good idea.

527
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,310
- I'll go in and say good night.
- That's a good boy.

528
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,272
We used to put
20 of them in there.

529
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,671
Activate the speed rollers, turn on
the hose circuits and that's it.

530
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,075
Vic Zeck's liquid lunch!

531
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,239
Good night, everybody.

532
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,390
I'm going to bed.

533
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,751
I bet you never seen
a pair of these before.

534
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,753
Take a sniff.

535
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,875
- It smells like a peach.
- What are those?

536
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,951
They're my panties. They're edible.

537
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,079
Edible. Hey, wow. The wonders of
modern petro technology.

538
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,471
- Where'd you get them?
- At school. All the kids have them.

539
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,230
- They're tasty.
- They come in four flavours.

540
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,868
- What a great idea.
- Yeah. Four flavours.

541
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,271
Earl, want some of your daughter's
panties? They come in four flavours.

542
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,830
Banana, peach, mint,
and, of course, cherry.

543
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,352
Good night, ladies.

544
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,549
You should have gone
up to bed like I said.

545
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,474
Nice meeting you.
Good night, Enid.

546
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,913
- Nice, Earl. Good move.
- Guys, it's 2 in the morning.

547
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,071
Come on, you need some sleep.

548
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,397
Turn off the lights, Earl.

549
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,870
Two? 2:00?

550
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,158
Is that right? Can that be right?

551
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,754
What do you want?

552
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,919
Please let me in, Earl.
I'll give you a kiss. Anyplace you like.

553
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,429
Oh, Christ.

554
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,317
You've got no interest in me.
Why are you coming on to me?

555
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,069
We could have a real good time, Earl.
I don't care about your false teeth.

556
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,558
- I havert got false teeth.
- I'm sorry. I guess they just look false.

557
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,593
Look, what do you want from me?

558
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,754
Not just now, the whole thing.
You and Vic. Why?

559
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,953
Poor baby. I guess no one ever
tried to make friends with you before.

560
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,718
Here.

561
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,349
Earl, if you won't
let me come in and play...

562
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,636
...you come out and play with me.
- Earl.

563
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,233
- Just for a little while.
- Earl.

564
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,954
- We can talk.
- Earl, are you down there?

565
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,912
Coming.

566
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,789
Wait. Stay here. I'll be right back.

567
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,111
Who were you
talking to down there?

568
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,317
Talking to? Nobody.

569
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,432
Well.

570
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,797
I'm gonna take a shower.

571
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,151
Whatever you say, Earl.

572
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,232
Ramona.

573
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,879
Ramona.

574
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,033
- Well, that was a huge waste of time.
- What do you want?

575
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,719
I give your car a good going-over,
a real good going-over.

576
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,873
And there's nothing wrong with it.
Not a damn thing. So I brung it back.

577
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,630
I guess you had a
good laugh on me, huh?

578
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,189
- Pardon?
- Making a horse's patoot out of me.

579
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,954
- Yeah, huh?
- Wait. I didn't ask to have my...

580
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,430
...car hauled away. Someone
played a joke on both of us.

581
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,352
You're just full of jokes, arert you?

582
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,557
Well, I think you're a dirty
shit sack, how about that?

583
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,398
Ramona.

584
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,993
Who goes there?

585
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,193
Hi. It's Earl Keese.

586
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,679
Oh, God!

587
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,478
Oh, God.

588
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,399
My God, I thought you were a prowler.
You all right?

589
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,596
- I guess so.
- You look bad, Earl.

590
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,233
You sure you didn't get hit?

591
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,709
I don't know.
I've never been shot at before.

592
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,235
What were you doing out here?
What was that noise?

593
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,198
- What are you up to now?
- Nothing.

594
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,510
Bet you're looking
for Ramona, arert you?

595
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,713
- No.
- You're rooting around for Ramona.

596
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,634
I'm not rooting around.
She wanted to talk.

597
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,234
She wanted to talk?

598
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,910
Well, actually,
I wanted to talk to someone.

599
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,439
You wanna talk to me?

600
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,358
Sure.

601
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,790
Come on. Inside.

602
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,558
Grab a seat,
I'll fix us some coffee.

603
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,911
I feel terrible about your eye.

604
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,713
Couldrt be helped.

605
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,874
What are you doing
with all that stuff on?

606
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,959
I was gonna take a dive in the swamp,
try to locate my truck and airplane.

607
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,594
I remember Mrs. Warren used
to bake bread in this kitchen.

608
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,150
I could smell the bread
all the way over at my house.

609
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,395
- Instant okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,312
Better get that fixed.

611
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,240
- Strong?
- Well, not too.

612
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,918
- I gotta rinse this out.
- And waste that coffee?

613
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,672
I'll just put it someplace
until I wash out the cup.

614
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,119
Sit down, Earl.

615
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,635
- I just want to...
- Sit down.

616
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,594
Now, just put the coffee powder
back in the cup.

617
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,390
- Can I wash my hand?
- No.

618
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,199
I thought you came over here to talk.

619
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,799
I like mine tepid and black.
How about you?

620
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,513
Same.

621
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,479
Now you take back that cup you keep
switching, Earl. Or it'll be pump city.

622
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,468
Well, it makes no difference to me.

623
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,393
So.

624
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,592
Here we are.

625
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,192
It's about your daughter,
Elaine, isn't it?

626
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,758
I thought so.

627
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,830
I'd say you got a
real problem there, Earl.

628
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,070
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

629
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,117
Drugs. I can tell.

630
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,437
That spaced- out look.

631
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,478
Used to see it in dust cases
the state police brought in...

632
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,359
...when I was night custody chief
at Oakville Mental.

633
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,399
Yeah, she's got the dries. She
always keeps licking her lips.

634
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,996
- She was dying for a fix.
- She has never taken drugs in her life.

635
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,472
- Never!
- Well, it was just a wild guess.

636
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,516
They think she stole a ring at school.
I just can't believe it.

637
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,559
Is that all? I thought there was
some kind of major catastrophe.

638
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,553
She's been expelled, for God's sake.

639
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,518
I can think of a problem
that's more important...

640
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,910
...and you, as a parent,
are ignoring it.

641
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,672
What?

642
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,749
What is Elaine doing about sex?
Is she getting probed?

643
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,957
That was very foolish, Earl.
And it could get you snuffed!

644
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,513
Why do I keep getting sucked
into these degrading conversations?

645
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,630
Why should I assume that suddenly
you'll turn into a human being?

646
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,149
Both you or Ramona.

647
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,272
Enid?

648
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,752
- Yes, Earl?
- Why is this door locked?

649
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,158
Is that the dog?
Enid, is that goddamn dog in there?

650
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,518
It's all right.
He's housebroken. Almost.

651
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,912
What the hell is going on in there?

652
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,717
Enid?
Do you realise how this looks?

653
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,953
Should have slipped it through the mail
slot while you had the chance, Earl.

654
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,676
This is going to take explaining, Enid.
A helluva lot of explaining.

655
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,271
- Daddy, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

656
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,159
- I was talking to your mother.
- Through the door?

657
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,108
- It wasn't very important. Go to sleep.
- I just got up.

658
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,919
Okay, then do that, then.

659
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,517
How about this?
Beautiful morning, huh?

660
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,228
Somebody really did
a number on your front end here.

661
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,915
Not to worry. I know a gypsy
in the city does cheap bodywork.

662
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,710
Somebody wrote something here too.
Said "pimp wagon."

663
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,313
You know who wrote that.

664
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,630
Why would I let
anybody write on your car?

665
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,360
I gotta use this buggy today,
to get us breakfast.

666
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,272
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

667
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,319
- Just you and me?
- Yeah. Right. Who needs the women?

668
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,110
You know, personally, I think if it'd
just been us guys last night...

669
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,834
...we wouldn't have had any trouble.
- Really?

670
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,434
I know women,
upside down and backwards...

671
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,989
...which is not a bad way
to know them, huh?

672
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,709
I guess so. Say, what does
that say on your arm?

673
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:34,518
- "Born to party."
- It's the way I live, babe. Have a cigar.

674
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,431
You ever seen one of these?

675
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,994
Wow.

676
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,671
You know what you and I need?

677
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,514
- A boys' night out.
- Yeah.

678
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,473
- You fool around?
- Yeah, sure.

679
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,911
Good. Keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna get us breakfast.

680
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,594
I hope you like
blueberry pancakes and sausage.

681
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,716
- That's what you're getting.
- Sounds great.

682
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,757
Not the way I fix them.

683
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,751
Get your foot off the gas!

684
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,071
Well, watch the lever. Put your...!

685
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,879
Stop. Pull up, you jerk.
Back up.

686
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,359
What...?

687
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:49,514
Stop it. Watch where you're going.
Stop. Would you stop? You stupid shit!

688
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,830
I ought to crush
your head with a mallet.

689
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,953
The kid's an animal.
You got the keys?

690
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,793
It's not my truck.
The owner went to get breakfast.

691
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,712
I hear you got a whore in there.

692
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,313
- Who told you that?
- I heard.

693
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,391
- Well you heard wrong.
- Ain't got a whore?

694
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,993
- No.
- Know where to find one?

695
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,152
- Of course not.
- Lf one shows up, you let me know?

696
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,074
Careful. That mother freaking
snap back between...

697
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,118
...your legs and lash your
whacker off something fierce.

698
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,472
Well.

699
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,630
It doesrt look too bad, does it?
I don't think we'll have to tow it away.

700
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,677
Am I right?

701
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,999
You the bastard that mouthed off
to my dad last night?

702
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,108
He smashed my car and
he punched me in the stomach.

703
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,952
Oh, yeah?

704
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,037
How would you like your
nuts nailed to your forehead, huh?

705
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,715
Hey. Leave that wart-head alone.
Come on, we got cesspools to suck.

706
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,512
Okay, Dad.

707
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,672
You're lucky.

708
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,034
I gotta go help my dad now.
But I'll be back.

709
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,230
Hey, Vic. They got your truck.

710
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,435
Looks as good as new.
Not a scratch on it.

711
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,517
Well, where's breakfast?

712
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,718
Not a scratch?

713
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,909
The rear axle's broken.

714
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,475
Well, I'll get it fixed. It's only fair.

715
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,191
- Forget it. Give it a decent burial.
- You don't want your truck?

716
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,078
You don't get it, do you?

717
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,913
I'm moving. Away.

718
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,669
Moving? What do you mean, moving?
You havert been here 24 hours yet.

719
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,671
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. That swamp.

720
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,308
In the summer, it must be
a swing club for mosquitoes.

721
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,152
The county sprays.
It's no problem.

722
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,629
Those lines,
they're too close to the house.

723
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,995
They cause hair loss,
lumbar ecstimiosis...

724
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,957
...post cortical lesions and impotency.

725
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,394
It's just a myth.

726
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,791
The power company wouldn't
put them up if they were dangerous.

727
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,834
Of course, it's your right to move,
I guess.

728
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,037
But as far as I'm concerned,
I'd honestly like you to stay.

729
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,633
You would?

730
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,991
Well, to tell you the truth...

731
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,589
...I havert got
any friends around here.

732
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,673
I mean it.
As crazy as last night was...

733
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,678
... even though I hated your guts
through most of it...

734
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,319
...I really had...

735
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,959
...a good time.

736
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,833
Good time.

737
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,790
I can't remember a better time
on any Friday night I've ever had.

738
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,353
Neither can I.

739
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,431
I bet Ramona doesrt wanna move,
does she?

740
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,353
She's not moving.
You can have her. She's all paid for.

741
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,597
This is another joke.
Of course you're gonna take your wife.

742
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,432
She might come in handy.

743
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,115
- Who says she's my wife?
- She's not your wife?

744
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,430
- Whose wife is she?
- I couldn't care less.

745
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,160
If you want her, she's yours.
With my compliments.

746
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,914
Well, I gotta pack.
It's been nice knowing you.

747
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,912
Enid. Open this door.

748
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,758
It's open.

749
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,279
Where's Enid?

750
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,150
What the hell's going on in here?
Why was that door locked before?

751
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,673
Where's my wife?

752
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,279
She's your wife.

753
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,153
Oh, yeah? Well, you know
what Vic just told me?

754
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,753
- What?
- He's moving.

755
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,797
Moving away.
And leaving you here.

756
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,713
He said I could have you.
What do you think about that?

757
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,833
- Sounds exciting.
- I'm serious.

758
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,156
So am I.

759
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,591
For God's sake,
Ramona, cover yourself.

760
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,273
Come on.

761
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,116
- People just don't do this kind of thing.
- But we could.

762
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,712
Don't worry about Enid.

763
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,078
She's not around.
We won't be disturbed.

764
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,234
Come on, before it gets cold.

765
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,674
I can't.

766
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,990
I know. You're worried about Vic.

767
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,675
No, I'm not worried about Vic.

768
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,956
- He's next door packing.
- All right, baby.

769
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,799
- Baby, watch it. All right, sweetheart.
- Oh, boy.

770
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,830
One time.
All right. All right, sweetie.

771
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,396
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

772
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,797
All right. Looking good.

773
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,438
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

774
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,437
Jesus, what a case.

775
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,670
Two minutes ago, he said
he was moving away.

776
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,353
I think Vic was right about you.

777
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,234
About what?

778
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,990
He said up is definitely not
your direction.

779
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,509
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

780
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,240
Okay, we'll just see about that.

781
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,034
That's my little sweetheart. All right.

782
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:23,956
All right, dive, baby, dive.
Let's see a screaming dive. All right.

783
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,680
- Hi, neighbour.
- Hi.

784
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,595
Now, I'm just gonna go under
the covers and take a little inventory.

785
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,550
- Promise you won't go away.
- I promise.

786
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,077
What beautiful performance. Beautiful.
Watch that mixture, watch that mixture.

787
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,430
All right, all right.

788
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,950
All right, that's my sweetie.
Good, climb, baby, climb.

789
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,758
Come on, Earl.

790
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,559
I can't concentrate. It's Vic's plane.

791
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,157
That's it. Watch it.
Watch that mixture, take it easy.

792
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,952
Good. He stopped.

793
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,719
Earl. Earl, come quick!

794
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,915
Where are you, are you
upstairs? Earl?

795
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,669
- Vic, what happened?
- We're losing the house, babe.

796
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,152
Vic's house is on fire.

797
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,833
Did you call the fire department?

798
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,470
My phone's dead.
Your phone's dead too.

799
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,675
Water, water.

800
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,431
Look. Look, there's no fire.
It's a trick.

801
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,834
Oh, it was terrible.

802
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,156
I had her up to 100 feet.
Everything was great.

803
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,594
Then the controls jammed.

804
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,073
I think it was that tower.

805
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,357
- My signal couldn't get to the servos.
- Poor baby.

806
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,630
The motor cut out.
I knew it was in the soup.

807
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,031
She went into a vertical spin,
hit the power lines, bounced up.

808
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,350
And then she climbed 300 feet.

809
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,151
You should've seen her.
She was magnificent.

810
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,676
She just sort of stopped
and hung there.

811
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,434
Then she nosed over and came
straight down into my attic.

812
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,990
- The fuel pods exploded in seconds.
- Jesus.

813
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,834
I stamped on the flames,
and everything spread so fast.

814
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,592
That old house is like a matchbox.

815
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,991
If you hadrt had the keys to the car,
he could have driven to a phone.

816
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,596
- What about his truck?
- You broke his rear axle, Daddy.

817
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,871
All right, here, then. It works.

818
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,349
Go ahead. Call the fire department.

819
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,318
You see, he won't even use
the phone.

820
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,710
This is just another one of
his cheap tricks.

821
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,758
Isn't that right, Vic?

822
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,353
Look at him, Enid.

823
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,036
You're fawning all over a fake,
a phoney and a fraud.

824
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,877
- Hey, brother, how about a beer?
- No, thank you.

825
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,999
Look at that thing go.

826
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,119
- What's wrong with the water?
- No pressure. Can't you see?

827
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,556
- Well, what can we do about it?
- I know what we can do.

828
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,637
- What?
- Get some marshmallows.

829
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,397
Enid. Elaine.

830
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,392
Relax. They're all gone.
They left in your car.

831
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,318
Elaine had a key.

832
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,357
Vic made a trade.

833
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,431
All of them for me.

834
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,952
It's been less than 24 hours since
you and Vic moved in next door.

835
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,517
- It seems like years.
- A lot has happened.

836
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,831
You gonna miss Vic?

837
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,399
Vic?

838
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,878
I don't know.

839
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,595
He was fantastic in bed.

840
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,478
Until I got in it.

841
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,039
You know, it's really great
that you can...

842
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,513
...admit things like that
in your relationship.

843
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,951
You're really wonderful.

844
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,839
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

845
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,395
Is it so hard having your fantasies
come to life?

846
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,633
There's not a single living thing
left on this road...

847
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,030
... except you and me.

848
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,678
You know what we're gonna do now,
Earl, just you and me?

849
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,793
What?

850
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,032
Have breakfast. Are you hungry?

851
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,713
I'm starving, but there's no food
in the house.

852
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,791
Well, if you have ketchup
and hot water...

853
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,632
...I could make you tomato soup.

854
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,559
Hey.

855
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,957
I got a better idea. We'll go to the city.
We'll go anyplace you like.

856
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,270
What kind of food?
French, Spanish, fish?

857
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,593
- I like Greek.
- Greek. Great.

858
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,512
I know a great Greek restaurant.

859
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,830
- I'll go get a cab. I'll get ready...
- Oh, Earl?

860
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,474
Yeah?

861
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,348
I know just who I want for dessert.

862
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,752
Ramona.

863
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,431
Ramona?

864
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,912
Ramona?

865
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,797
Ramona.

866
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,272
Surprise!

867
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,953
See, buddy, I got you breakfast.

868
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,509
Hey, Daddy, Vic brought
my five favourite junk foods.

869
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,877
Elaine, get out the china. We'll inale
this poison on the good stuff.

870
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,635
- Where's all that plum sauce?
- It's in here, it's in here. Wait a second.

871
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,835
Would you like some wine, Enid?

872
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,114
You know, I've been thinking, Enid.

873
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,230
For the past couple of years...

874
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,709
...things around here have been...

875
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,674
...stagnant.

876
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,435
Not uncomfortable, mind you, but...

877
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,068
...changeless. Tedious.

878
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,151
Except for last night,
with Vic and Ramona.

879
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,670
They're a sign. They're a revelation.

880
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,270
They're squeezing the maximum yield
out of life.

881
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,190
Let's get back to the world
of the living.

882
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,636
Let's move back to the city.
Or move to the country.

883
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,995
I mean, this is neither.

884
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,838
What do you say?

885
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,635
I understand your restlessness, Earl.

886
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,756
But true change comes only
from within.

887
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,831
- Would you pass the wine?
- You feel it too?

888
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,479
Not a bit.

889
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,200
But I do think the city would be
a good idea.

890
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,634
For you, in any case.

891
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,431
But I meant for both of us.

892
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,392
If we had the money...

893
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,990
...I think I'd go back to school.

894
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,878
I'd like to...

895
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,874
...intensify my Native American
art studies.

896
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,315
We'll have the money.
We'll sell the house.

897
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,948
Vic, here, will buy it.
He's rolling in dough.

898
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,556
Why do you think he crashed his plane
into his house and burned it down?

899
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,113
Why, Daddy?

900
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,629
For the insurance money. Right, Vic?

901
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,234
How much you have the old place
insured for?

902
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,476
He didn't have any insurance.

903
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,232
He never does.

904
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,959
Of course he had insurance.

905
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,271
The bank wouldn't give him a mortgage
without insurance.

906
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,435
He didn't have a mortgage.

907
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,997
You paid cash?

908
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,637
You rented?

909
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,469
Do you remember
when your neighbour, Mrs. Warren...

910
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,478
...moved to Riverside Nursing Home
after her husband died?

911
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,915
Well, that's when we met her.

912
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,518
Vic used to dress her all the time.

913
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,398
Mrs. Warren would always
ask for Vic.

914
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,352
Well, when she died...

915
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,431
...the house was empty,
so we moved in.

916
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,276
Vic said she wouldn't mind.

917
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,956
I said it was a steal.

918
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,396
This is really something.

919
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,513
You two ought to be on 60 Minutes.

920
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,672
Yeah, but now we don't have
no place to live.

921
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,952
Daddy, they could live in my room.

922
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,475
Dick's invited me to Florida
for a couple of weeks.

923
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,676
His mom won't be there.
She said it's okay.

924
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,071
You stay out of this. You're not going
anywhere and Dick is off-limits.

925
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,153
Maybe that's not a bad idea
that Elaine had.

926
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,231
I mean, they could stay
in the guest room.

927
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,517
I don't know. That room's loaded
with a lot of furniture and junk.

928
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,558
If we did stay, we'd really need
the big room, facing the road.

929
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,552
The master bedroom?

930
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,990
Hey, don't worry, we'd earn our keep
around here.

931
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,474
How wonderful.

932
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,392
- No heavy yard work, though.
- Hernia.

933
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,676
Well, I don't know, it is my bedroom.

934
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,752
I kind of have a sentimental
attachment to it.

935
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,194
I'll tell you what.

936
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,112
With a scrub-down
and some carpentry...

937
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,589
...we could make conditions liveable
in the garage.

938
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,988
Garage, huh?

939
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,115
Right. That's it, then.
Ramona, let's hit the road.

940
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,232
Please. Look, I was just kidding.

941
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,352
I want you to stay. Both of you.
You're won'th it.

942
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,512
Please stay.

943
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,079
As my friends.

944
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,428
Please.

945
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,989
Stay here, in the outer limits
of the dead-end zone?

946
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,960
Nothing personal, but life
at the end of the road...

947
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:33,470
...just ain't for Captain Vic
and Empress Ramona.

948
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,838
Sorry, folks, but you can
colour us gone.

949
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,992
Boy, they were neat.

950
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,110
They were beyond neat.

951
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,070
They were extraordinary...

952
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,992
...unique...

953
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,631
...special.

954
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,472
Earl, can you write me a check?

955
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,393
I'm gonna need some money
this week.

956
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,840
- How much?
- How much is in the account?

957
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,274
I don't know.

958
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,351
Where's the checkbook?

959
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,432
The checkbook!

960
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,950
- I'm hungry again. You wanna eat?
- Oh, yeah.

961
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,999
Hold it. Hold it right there, folks.

962
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,917
All right.

963
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,912
Let me have it.

964
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,877
What are you talking about
now, Earl?

965
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,635
My checkbook. Not that there's
any money left in my account.

966
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,199
That's what you think of me?

967
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,920
I take your hospitality,
I break bread with your family.

968
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,513
You still think I'd rob you?

969
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,272
Look, just give me the checkbook.

970
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,319
I'm not even gonna talk about
the $32 you stole from me last night...

971
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,391
...when you were
supposed to get dinner...

972
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,869
...and cooked that bogus
spaghetti meal instead.

973
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,314
Your checkbook.

974
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,789
It's on the table in the hall,
next to your wallet.

975
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,236
My wallet! Enid?
Look on the table in the hall.

976
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,715
Do you see my wallet
and checkbook there?

977
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,949
Elaine, get ready to call the police.

978
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,951
Oh, Earl.

979
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,076
Hey. Kojak.

980
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,236
How much is left in the account?

981
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,318
There's $310 left in the account.

982
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,268
Vic spent $17 on pants and a shirt
from Goodwill.

983
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,991
And there's a receipt here for $32...

984
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,071
...from Mr. Fong's Fast Chow.

985
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,550
Do you want me to call
the National Guard now, Daddy?

986
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,278
- Elaine, get the car.
- What for?

987
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,749
Just do as I ask.

988
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,638
Please.

989
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,438
Give me the wallet.

990
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,431
All right, now...

991
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,114
...I don't want any argument
about this.

992
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,832
This is the least I can do after all
the trouble I've put you two through.

993
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,151
I just hope that someday
you can forgive me.

994
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,958
- Here.
- What's that?

995
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,678
It's his vehicle registration.

996
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,195
He just signed over his car to us.

997
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,634
Really, Earl?

998
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,109
Yes. It's all yours.

999
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,670
L... I want you to have it...

1000
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,400
...because, well...

1001
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,676
Because I just want you to have it...

1002
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,434
...and to get safely to wherever
you're going.

1003
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,559
And, maybe, time and again, you might
think about your old neighbours...

1004
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,994
...here on Burt Street.

1005
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,196
What's happening, Daddy?

1006
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,952
Your old man just gave me
his car, honey.

1007
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,032
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, you don't have to say anything.

1008
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,679
It doesrt seem enough.

1009
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,398
Oh, Earl.

1010
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,109
You are the best.

1011
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,590
Hey, come on. Take it easy,
super stud.

1012
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,830
You make me look bad.

1013
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,435
So make sure you take care
of my little Burt Street beauties.

1014
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,636
- I'll try.
- All right.

1015
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,438
Some time we had, huh?

1016
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,068
Don't drive too long.
You havert had much sleep.

1017
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,390
Remember those shots
I took at you last night?

1018
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,874
Yeah, I remember.

1019
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,433
Come here.

1020
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,837
I knew it was you.
That's why I missed.

1021
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,999
Thanks, Vic.

1022
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,833
Oh, I almost forgot.
Check the sticker on the door panel.

1023
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,389
She'll need an oil change
in about 1000 miles.

1024
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,313
Use Wolf's Head Golden 30-weight.

1025
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,799
It'll never let you down.

1026
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,957
Thanks, buddy.

1027
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,958
Okay, pal.

1028
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,953
- Bye, folks.
- Goodbye.

1029
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,554
Oh, we'll miss you.
I wish you werert going.

1030
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,836
- Don't forget to write, huh?
- Bye.

1031
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,150
Be cool, guys.

1032
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,388
And now back to
our afternoon feature...

1033
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,075
...Redstone Romance, starring
Clive Breck er...

1034
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,879
... Marjorie Crane and Sky Saxon.

1035
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,510
Hey, Dad, thanks.
It was far-out. Goodbye.

1036
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,318
- Where you going?
- Back to school.

1037
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,356
Back to school?
I thought you got kicked out.

1038
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,473
Connie Schiff confessed.
They threw her out and cleared me.

1039
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,349
Oh, that's my ride. I gotta go
or I'll miss the train. Bye, Dad.

1040
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,679
- Elaine, I don't want you in that truck!
- I can't hear you.

1041
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,072
I'll call you next week. Don't forget
to mail my allowance. Bye.

1042
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,549
See you later, wart-head.

1043
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,475
Bye, Daddy.

1044
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,314
Where are you going?

1045
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,075
Oh, I have an emergency meeting of my
Native American art study circle.

1046
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,232
- Where'd that getup come from?
- It was a present.

1047
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,879
Oh, that must be Mr. Thundersky.

1048
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,998
- Mr. Thundersky?
- My ride.

1049
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:05,119
- Who the hell is that?
- Don't wait up. Bye.

1050
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,471
Hello. I'm Charles Haults, president
of Spruce Hill Memorial Chapels.

1051
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,349
For over 50 years, West Valley
families have trusted Spruce Hill...

1052
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,637
... with the interment and care
of their loved ones.

1053
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,792
Now, Spruce Hill Park
and Spruce Hill Monuments...

1054
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,397
... join to offer you a modern concept
in funeral aftercare.

1055
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,994
For the entombment
you've always dreamed of...

1056
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,276
... Spruce Hill now introduces
an exclusive...

1057
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,477
... aboveground display chamber.

1058
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,197
Spruce Hill's aboveground
entombment utilises a method called...

1059
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,590
... uniform Plexiglas enclosure.

1060
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,796
It ensures permanent preservation...

1061
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,157
... so your loved ones will be able
to see clearly and vividly...

1062
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,993
... the object of their grief, forever.

1063
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,720
Visit Spruce Hill's
Aboveground display chamber.

1064
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,668
The time to choose your case is now.

1065
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,198
Ramona!

1066
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,351
I see you still have
the same old wallpaper.

1067
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:48,794
Hey.

1068
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,956
You two make a sharp couple.

1069
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,154
You wouldn't believe it.
It happened at the same time.

1070
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,596
Vic stared at me. I stared at him.
We both knew it was wrong.

1071
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,796
It's just not gonna be any fun
without you.

1072
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,235
Honest? Does that mean you'll stay?

1073
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,789
- We've got plenty of room.
- No, no. We're past that.

1074
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,679
- You're coming with us.
- Really?

1075
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,274
Me come with you?
No, you don't mean it.

1076
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,237
Sure we mean it. It'll be a blast.

1077
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,960
Come on, let's go. We're getting old.

1078
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,593
- The dishwasher's on.
- It'll stay on.

1079
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,990
All right, damn it. You're on.
Let's do it.

1080
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,232
This is crazy, but there's something
so right about it. Let's go.

1081
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,473
- Hold it. Not so fast, pal.
- What?

1082
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:38,349
Don't you think you should
leave a note for Enid?

1083
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:44,038
You're right. In fact, I'll leave
a little more than just a note.

1084
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:01,871
No, no, no. Up front,
right next to Captain Vic.

1085
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,837
- Where are we going?
- How should I know?

1086
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,514
You tell me. I'm just driving.

1087
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,152
- Off into the land of the great unknown.
- Look.

1088
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:24,150
You werert kidding. You really are
leaving a little more than a note.

1089
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,517
Well, Enid never did like to come home
to a dark house.
