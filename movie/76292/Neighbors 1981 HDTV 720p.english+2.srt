1
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,751
<i>Stay with us for</i>
<i>blood-chilling suspense...</i>

2
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,837
<i>... blackmail, murder,</i>
<i>intrigue and love.</i>

3
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,046
<i>Next on Channel 8.</i>

4
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:10,790
<i>- A tourist, visiting a friend,</i>
<i>was struck...</i>

5
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,421
<i>... by a 30-pound block as he</i>
<i>walked down the stage-door alley.</i>

6
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,303
<i>The cinder block hit me</i>
<i>on the flat side...</i>

7
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:20,097
<i>... of the block itself,</i>
<i>as if it were hurled at me.</i>

8
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,559
<i>- When the ferry dock ed,</i>
<i>he was napping.</i>

9
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:27,060
<i>A deck hand wok e him and told him</i>
<i>to drive off. But Max was in reverse.</i>

10
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:30,439
<i>He went right off the back of the ferry.</i>
<i>He drowned.</i>

11
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,947
<i>But if you were complaining</i>
<i>about the weather this week end...</i>

12
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:36,655
<i>... it could have been worse.</i>
<i>A series of floods...</i>

13
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,402
- I guess it's that time.
- You want any help?

14
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:44,540
There was a terrific recipe for capon
in the <i>Times</i> today.

15
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:48,168
Takes two minutes.

16
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:50,541
<i>The National Guard has been</i>
<i>called out...</i>

17
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,710
<i>... and some people may have to...</i>

18
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:23,747
Enid, someone's moving into
the Warren place.

19
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:24,960
So?

20
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:29,084
It's a funny time to be moving.

21
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:33,088
I don't see any kids' stuff.

22
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:34,927
Thank God.

23
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:44,477
Maybe we should ask them over
for a drink tonight.

24
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:47,938
- It being their first night and all.
- Tomorrow will be fine.

25
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,397
Well, tomorrow's not tonight,
you know.

26
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:53,736
- And it would be nice.
- There's plenty of time to be nice.

27
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:55,982
You don't have to push it.

28
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,476
I think they've got a dog.

29
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:38,154
Kalinqashe, the dog spirit,
is swift and faithful.

30
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:42,702
I don't care. I don't want him
in my garden digging up my bulbs.

31
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,122
Who would want your bulbs?

32
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:48,604
Hello.

33
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:53,980
- What can I do for you?
- Anything you like.

34
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,187
The question is,
what do you want in return?

35
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:07,033
Hi. I'm Ramona.
I just moved in next door.

36
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:10,290
- Oh, really?
- Really.

37
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:17,623
Who's this?

38
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:21,004
- Your girlfriend?
- No, that's my daughter, Elaine.

39
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,587
That's a hot one.

40
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:41,770
By the way, my name is Earl Keese.

41
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,864
I was real friendly
with a boy named Earl once.

42
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,070
Well, twice really.

43
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,127
So you're all moved in next door, huh?

44
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:57,580
It's a very good house. I imagine
you'll want to freshen it up.

45
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,832
Give it a new coat of paint,
mow the lawn.

46
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,551
Is your wife here?

47
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,421
She's in the kitchen.

48
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:07,717
- She's dying to meet you. I'll get her.
- No, no, I don't want to meet her.

49
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,429
I hope we're gonna be friends.

50
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:14,513
We were very friendly
with the Warrens next door.

51
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,891
But we weren't that close.

52
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,315
I mean, we were next-door close.

53
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:24,653
I didn't mean that kind of close.
I mean "close" close.

54
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,069
Is your wife making dinner?

55
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:30,320
She's fixing a great capon.

56
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:32,988
It was in the <i>Times</i> today.

57
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,619
Would you like to stay for dinner?

58
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,251
Are there more of you?

59
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,789
Is there a Mr. Ramona?

60
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,588
You go ask your wife if it's okay.

61
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:47,508
No, it's no problem, really.

62
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:49,306
Don't argue with me, Earl.

63
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,595
You wouldn't want me
to have to pull down your pants...

64
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,347
...and spank your little buns...

65
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,141
...would you?

66
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:11,073
Don't you go away. I'll be right back.

67
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:12,956
Okay?

68
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,257
- How many frozen waffles you want?
- Waffles? What happened to the capon?

69
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,339
- What capon?
- You said you read...

70
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,015
...an incredible recipe for it.
- I didn't say we were having it.

71
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,683
Leave it to you
to take something for granted.

72
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:38,812
Frozen waffles is all we've got.

73
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,808
Weren't you gonna pick up steaks
for tomorrow?

74
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:43,610
You're asking for steak?

75
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,186
You could have picked up
some cheap ones.

76
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,690
I will not eat cheap meat.

77
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,545
<i>No! No!</i>

78
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:11,974
- May I help you?
- Hi, Earl. I'm Vic.

79
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:15,017
I'm sure Ramona's already told you
my whole life story.

80
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:19,349
- No, but you must be her...
- That's me, like it or not.

81
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:23,141
If you know what I mean. Have a seat.

82
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:28,280
So, what do you say, neighbour?

83
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:32,149
Welcome to the end of the road,
I guess.

84
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:33,947
- It's a great house.
- Thank you.

85
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:37,953
I mean mine. More rooms than we
need, really, but I couldn't resist.

86
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,239
It was a steal.

87
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:41,494
What's on the menu, pal?
I'm starved.

88
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:46,420
We haven't eaten all day. We could eat
a baby's butt through a park bench.

89
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,795
I'm afraid I spoke too soon earlier.

90
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,971
We haven't got enough.
Enid didn't get to her shopping today.

91
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,845
Well, no sweat.
I'll just go and get some takeout.

92
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:59,184
There's nothing around here
except the standard burgers...

93
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:02,355
...greasy dogs and a gummy pizza.
- I can do better than that.

94
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:05,146
You just leave everything
to Captain Vic.

95
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:10,529
Look, friend, if I do the running,
I know you'll wanna spring for the tab.

96
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:12,451
Okay.

97
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,750
Thirty bucks?
For four grown people?

98
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:27,835
Where have you been? It takes
30 bucks just to look at a menu.

99
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,387
- This is a $2 bill.
- Let me see that.

100
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:35,762
Gee, I thought it was a 20.

101
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,552
- Really.
- Well, people palm them off that way.

102
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:43,062
You never know who's gonna
stick it to you, do you, Earl?

103
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:47,312
Look, if 32 bucks isn't enough,
we can always do it some other night.

104
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:50,440
Why don't we do it now.
Let's have your car keys, okay?

105
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:53,449
- My car keys?
- Yeah, my brakes are shot.

106
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:57,152
Why don't I get the food? I'm the one
who's supposed to be neighbourly.

107
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,034
You stay here and my wife
will keep you company.

108
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:04,661
Forget it. If you insist on paying for
dinner, the least I can do is go get it.

109
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,536
What I don't understand
is where you're going.

110
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,588
There's no place decent around here.

111
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:13,293
If you must know, it's a new place,
opened up on the other side of town.

112
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,388
Near the train station.
Across from the warehouse.

113
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,181
Italian.

114
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,512
I commute, I go by there twice a day,
five days a week...

115
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,142
...and I've never seen
a restaurant around there.

116
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:27,481
You calling me a liar?

117
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:29,311
No, I...

118
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,310
I'm just not very observant,
I guess.

119
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:35,526
I can't blame you.
They don't have their sign up yet.

120
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,533
But it's got a cute name:
Caesar's Garlic Wars.

121
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:43,869
Okay. Why don't you
get some ravioli...

122
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,794
...and some... What do you
call those stuffed clams?

123
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:51,754
- Stuffed clams.
- Yeah. And some scampi and garlic.

124
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:54,962
Whatever I get, Earl,
I first have to get going.

125
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:57,011
I'll get the keys.

126
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,601
Why don't you stay here
and make yourself at home.

127
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,807
I'll be right here.

128
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,077
Hi.

129
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:24,455
Took a bath. There's a dead rat
in our tub over there.

130
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,040
Vic said not to move it.

131
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:31,418
Took a pill. Moving always makes me
kind of hyper.

132
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,040
I hope you don't mind.

133
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,799
Yeah. Sure. I don't mind.

134
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,296
Oh, you do mind, don't you?

135
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,014
Vic's going out for Italian food.

136
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:48,184
You come down and join us
whenever you can, okay?

137
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,688
What are you so nervous about, Earl?

138
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,739
Afraid Vic will think you're up here...

139
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,940
...chewing me?

140
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,422
What are you doing? Robbing me?

141
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:22,431
Looking for a pencil to write down
what you want for supper.

142
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,058
You got a pencil in your hand.

143
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:27,310
$327. Is that all you had
at the end of last month?

144
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:30,184
That's none of your business.
Stay out of there, please.

145
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:34,485
- I just wanted to get the order right.
- Why don't we go downstairs.

146
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:35,737
Sure.

147
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,065
After you.

148
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,279
- So, what do you want?
- Make it simple.

149
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:45,200
Spaghetti, meatballs, a salad.
Whatever you want for you and...

150
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,863
What's not simple
is how I get to the restaurant.

151
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,711
- Use my car.
- Has it got a key or a rubber band...

152
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:53,250
...you wind up?
- Why don't I go with you.

153
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:56,672
Afraid I'll steal your car?
That's why I moved in next door?

154
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:59,759
So I could rip off your car
and move somewhere else?

155
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,722
- There you go.
- Back in a flash, pal.

156
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,164
Waffles are browning.
Always a thrilling sight.

157
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:40,251
Good news, Enid.

158
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:43,090
Italian food is on the way.

159
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,223
You arranged it?

160
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,261
Well, more or less.
I invited the neighbours.

161
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:50,309
Oh, you met them.

162
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,438
What did you think?

163
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,666
Earl?

164
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,458
They're...

165
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:15,120
...different.

166
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:19,003
I guess I'll go up and get dressed.

167
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,009
Upstairs?

168
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:23,755
What for?

169
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:26,132
You said they were coming over.

170
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:28,880
Well, they're not dressing.
They're barely dressed.

171
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:33,472
I mean, you could go
in the kitchen and set the table.

172
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:37,146
And turn the waffles off.
I'll be there in a minute to help you.

173
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:40,069
You got lots to do down here.

174
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,027
Yeah, there is something I forgot to do.

175
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,674
That's a boy.
You want some steak?

176
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:00,348
Don't tell me, you must be
our new neighbour. Come on in.

177
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:02,555
Thanks a lot.

178
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:14,478
Someone's stolen our truck...

179
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:17,062
...and I need to use the phone
to call the police.

180
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:20,491
Use the phone in the kitchen.
What a terrible thing, your first day.

181
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:23,412
It's even worse than just that.
Baby was in the back.

182
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,581
- Oh, my.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

183
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,792
Vic. Your baby's drowning!

184
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,534
No chance.
Why should my dog be drowning?

185
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:33,465
Dog?

186
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,295
I thought "child."

187
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:39,422
We haven't any children.
Unless Ramona just pumped one out...

188
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:42,550
...and didn't tell me.
She calls the dog "Baby."

189
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,262
- She calls the dog "Baby"?
- Yeah. He's fine.

190
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:48,057
I just saw him around the back there.
When I drove up.

191
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,519
He's digging up something
in your flowerbed.

192
00:22:50,691 --> 00:22:52,019
My flowerbed?

193
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,698
Hi, Enid.

194
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,661
Hi, Vic.

195
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:04,739
Oh, we met hours ago.

196
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:07,451
Earl here was worried about Baby.

197
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:10,459
Oh, he's no trouble at all.
He's a perfect gentleman.

198
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:14,577
- Leave him with me any time you want.
- Don't worry, I will.

199
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:16,210
They spoil him awfully.

200
00:23:16,383 --> 00:23:20,428
I want him to have every advantage
I was denied as a young dog.

201
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:23,169
Well, here are your keys, Mr. Keese.

202
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:27,347
Let's dig into this stuff
before the sauce turns into penicillin.

203
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,678
Why don't you look for Ramona.

204
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:34,560
- Me?
- Finders keepers, Earl. After all...

205
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:37,404
...I know what goes on out here
in the suburbs.

206
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:40,028
That's why we moved here.

207
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,529
Oh, Vic.

208
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:52,459
- What do you think, Earl?
- Don't do that. You are outrageous.

209
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:08,757
Too bad about Vic's truck, Earl.

210
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:13,393
Well, I was just pushing it
into my garage...

211
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:16,270
...to hide it from him, you know,
kind of a joke.

212
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:19,361
- It was an accident.
- It could happen to anybody.

213
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:21,647
I think 1500 should take care of it.

214
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:24,397
Fifteen hundred? Dollars?

215
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:28,829
It was just a joke. I mean, I'm sure
your insurance will cover most of it...

216
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:32,082
...and I'll pay the deductible.
What is it, 100 or so?

217
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:36,959
For the truck.
Keeping me quiet is a little extra.

218
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,918
I don't believe it.

219
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:42,593
You're blackmailing me.

220
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,299
Hey, what are neighbours for?

221
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,887
Oh, make it cash.

222
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,446
Hey, come on in, buddy.
Help yourself.

223
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,341
Well, here we all are.

224
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:29,093
To Vic and Ramona.

225
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,971
For bringing a breath of fresh air
to our neighbourhood.

226
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:35,809
May we have many, many years
of your lovely company.

227
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:42,855
Do they have any country fairs here?

228
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,110
Where they do things like see
which bull has the biggest balls?

229
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:56,367
This isn't really country. It's more
a suburban bedroom community.

230
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:59,663
The locals are in service trades.
They're not farmers.

231
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,789
Maybe we can measure their balls.

232
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:08,136
Or we could start with yours,
if you like.

233
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:17,885
Good, is it?

234
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:21,562
- Delicious.
- I must call Caesar's...

235
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:23,360
...and compliment the chef.

236
00:26:23,654 --> 00:26:26,275
Tell me, were they crowded
this evening?

237
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,067
- What?
- Caesar's.

238
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:30,649
Friday night, the only place in town.

239
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:33,615
Bet they were turning them away
in droves.

240
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:35,995
Okay, you probably
called the place...

241
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,918
...and found out they're not open
for business yet, right?

242
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:40,337
Right.

243
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:43,121
So does that make me a liar?

244
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:45,457
Maybe I got there,
saw the place was closed...

245
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,840
...and went somewhere else
to pick up the food.

246
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:50,846
Where? Everything's shut at this hour.
Everything.

247
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:52,592
- And the wine?
- What's the matter?

248
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:55,802
Vic brings a wonderful dinner
and you give him the third degree.

249
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:58,303
I don't mind.
There's no mystery about it.

250
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,979
You know Valley Field Mall on Route 3?
Across from the Cinema Cineplex?

251
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:04,730
There's a small spaghetti and wine
dealership there.

252
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,481
Next to the Singer Sewing Centre.

253
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,364
That's where you got it?

254
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,276
That's right.

255
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,580
Well, to begin with,
Valley Field Mall is closed.

256
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:17,534
When it was open, it was
on Route 15, not Route 3.

257
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,115
And there can't be
a small spaghetti dealership...

258
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:22,998
...next to the Singer Centre
across from the cineplex...

259
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:27,632
...because there is no cineplex
and there is no Singer Sewing Centre.

260
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:32,762
All right, I can deceive you no longer.

261
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,966
Yes, yes, yes, I admit it.

262
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:37,099
It was me who prepared this meal...

263
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:40,186
...to share on our
first night together as neighbours.

264
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:44,639
This was my crime. Mixing up
a special batch of my Aunt Minota's...

265
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:47,226
...secret, sacred spaghetti sauce.

266
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:49,771
Sorry I messed up your evening. Right?

267
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,200
Right.

268
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,070
In light of Earl's feelings,
I think it would be best if we left.

269
00:27:55,245 --> 00:28:00,832
Oh, no, no. Sit down, sit down.
Let's finish this magnificent meal.

270
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:03,788
Don't worry about Earl.
He'll get over his feelings.

271
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:07,048
- He spurned my sauce.
- No, he loves your sauce.

272
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:09,292
He's just jealous, he can't cook.

273
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:13,802
Earl, isn't it your turn
to do a little confessing?

274
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:17,017
- What?
- Vic's been man enough to admit...

275
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:20,553
...he was the one who cooked supper.
You've got nothing to say?

276
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:25,351
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We do have an agreement, don't we?

277
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:27,983
I'm talking about what you did outside.

278
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:34,734
Yes, Ramona. I know and I accept
the figures you mentioned.

279
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:37,736
"Figures," Earl? What "figures"?

280
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:41,613
Just a little arrangement
I have with Ramona.

281
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,040
What sort of arrangement?

282
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:48,130
Oh, boy.

283
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:50,789
We're waiting.
Or do I have to pound it out of you?

284
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:53,126
Don't speak to me like that
in my own house.

285
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:55,463
- Why would I?
- You just did.

286
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:59,008
- It's just a something a guy says.
- I never say it.

287
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:01,764
- I don't blame you.
- Ramona...

288
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:05,312
...why don't you be man enough
to tell us since Earl isn't.

289
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,361
He tried to pork me.

290
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:14,066
Pork you? What?!

291
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:16,109
You know you did.

292
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,573
I swear, I never touched her.

293
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:21,325
Well, I wasn't born
with your hand in my bush.

294
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,116
Enid, help me.

295
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:27,080
Tell them I couldn't
do something like that.

296
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:31,211
- Let's leave that to the police.
- Vic, she's not my type.

297
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:37,550
Enid, you tell Earl he'll have
a chance to defend himself.

298
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:42,632
I think you can see
why we have to leave.

299
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:45,807
I know you meant well.
Didn't you?

300
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,687
We might have had
a wonderful relationship.

301
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,480
But then, as Arthur Bremer once said:

302
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:55,607
"How many things go right
in this crazy world?"

303
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:58,483
Ramona, let's go.

304
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:02,287
Come on, before he gets dangerous.

305
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,994
- I thought I'd be able to defend myself!
- Not so loud, Earl.

306
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:10,787
Afraid we'll disturb the neighbours?
These are the goddamn neighbours!

307
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:13,586
Calm yourself, Earl.
I'm not gonna take you to court.

308
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:16,843
That would make for bad blood.
We don't want any bad blood...

309
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:21,508
...especially since we'll be living
next door to you for a long, long time.

310
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:28,477
I swear to God, Enid,
we may have to move.

311
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,392
They're very strange people.

312
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,237
You know how after five minutes
when you meet someone...

313
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:35,063
...you know everything about them?

314
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,990
What they do, their last name.
We know nothing about them.

315
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:41,408
- So what?
- So why didn't you say something?

316
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:44,152
You were in the house the whole time
she was here.

317
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:47,000
Besides, you know how long it takes
to pork someone?

318
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,492
No, how long does it take, Earl?

319
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:51,995
Are you saying you believe her?

320
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:54,959
Enid, I'm the same man
you've known for 16 years.

321
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,760
I know.

322
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:59,509
What the hell's going on around here?

323
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,135
He comes waltzing in
and you say, "Hi, Vic."

324
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:05,926
- How did you know his name?
- He came over this afternoon.

325
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,221
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

326
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:12,062
- You could've told me in the car.
- You know we never talk in the car.

327
00:31:12,234 --> 00:31:14,191
Today you could've made an exception.

328
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:17,944
That house next door is empty
for six months and you meet...

329
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:21,365
...the new occupants before I do,
and you don't say anything?

330
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:24,619
- Enid, am I being unreasonable?
- Pass the wine.

331
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:27,287
Did you tell me everybody
you met today?

332
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:30,328
I didn't meet anyone today.
I never meet anyone.

333
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:33,040
A new neighbour's
a bit different, isn't it?

334
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,585
A new neighbour whose unit
we can stare at.

335
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:39,091
- I wasn't staring at his unit.
- I saw you, Enid.

336
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:42,630
I don't care what other wives do,
only the one I'm married to.

337
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,178
I know when a woman's
checking out a man's unit.

338
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,719
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, Vic's wife, that Ramona.

339
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:51,813
She did it to me, practically
unzipped my fly with her eyes.

340
00:31:51,982 --> 00:31:53,441
And you hated it, right?

341
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:56,645
How many stiff nips
did you check out at the office today?

342
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,521
I know you, Earl, your eyes
never sit still for a minute.

343
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:02,942
Why'd you give their dog our steak?

344
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:05,360
I saw you, behind my back.

345
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:08,491
I was afraid you wouldn't approve.

346
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,619
You were afraid right,
I can tell you that.

347
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,294
What could I do?

348
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:16,705
Vic asked me
to look after Baby for a while.

349
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:20,630
But steak? Jesus, why didn't you
stuff money into his mouth?

350
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,842
And 32 bucks for this load of crap?

351
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:25,136
It's his money.

352
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:28,472
Baby! Oh, my God! Baby!

353
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,850
Get that thing away from that thing!

354
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:39,976
What happened?

355
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:43,156
Baby was over by that thing
taking a leak.

356
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:46,366
Jesus Christ.

357
00:32:49,831 --> 00:32:52,120
Come, Baby. Come.

358
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:56,837
Come here. Come here.

359
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:05,761
He's all right.

360
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,103
Sweetie, where's the truck?

361
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:21,851
Maybe that thing got our truck
like Earl got me.

362
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,115
Relax with that stuff. Our boy here
has been through enough.

363
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:29,198
We really had you going there.
Ramona's such an imp.

364
00:33:29,371 --> 00:33:33,451
We were just kind of putting you on
at supper. Like a little joke.

365
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:37,575
A joke? You call accusing me
of porking Ramona a joke?

366
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:41,170
Oh, what's the matter with you, Earl?
Can't you take a joke?

367
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:45,635
Let's go, Ramona, come in the house.
It's Friday night. I'll buy you a drink.

368
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:49,593
Yeah, I can take a joke, Enid!

369
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:52,346
- Can you take a joke, Vic?
- Any joke you dish up.

370
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,895
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, try me.

371
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:55,605
- I sank your truck.
- What?

372
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:59,521
I didn't mean to. I lost control after
I moved the brick from under your tire.

373
00:33:59,693 --> 00:34:02,362
You touched my brick?
I told you I had no brakes.

374
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:04,688
I borrowed your car for the takeout.

375
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:08,649
- But you didn't go for takeout.
- Where's my truck and my airplane?

376
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:11,989
It's down in the swamp.
I'll go get my jacket.

377
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:15,664
We'll get your jacket later.
You just take me to...

378
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,245
...the swamp.

379
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:32,554
Give me the light, I'll lead the way.

380
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:35,395
You're pretty lucky,
having a swamp next to your house.

381
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:37,139
It didn't always smell this way.

382
00:34:37,313 --> 00:34:40,648
When we moved in, it was a freshwater
lake with fish and everything.

383
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:43,771
Then the Interstate Chemical
began dumping upstream...

384
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:46,437
...and weird things started to grow.

385
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:50,527
I haven't been here since the search
party a couple years ago.

386
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,161
Search party?

387
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:53,371
Yeah.

388
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,209
Some guy disappeared down here.

389
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:01,001
A lineman from the power company.
Said it was quicksand.

390
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:04,042
Quicksand, this part of the country?
No way.

391
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:05,710
That's what I said.

392
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:07,427
Vic!

393
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:08,846
Vic!

394
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,551
Vic, help me. Please help me!

395
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,850
Do you feel my truck in there?

396
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:18,593
Vic, come on, help me.
I'll buy you a new truck.

397
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:22,817
Not like that one. How about my
triplane? How you gonna replace that?

398
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:26,444
Help, please.
I'm being sucked down.

399
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:29,609
- Maybe it's best that way.
- What are you talking about?

400
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,316
You're not the ideal neighbour.
You sank my truck...

401
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:35,068
...you insulted my sauce
and you violated Ramona.

402
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:38,622
- You said it was just a joke.
- But she was in your bathtub.

403
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,749
No, she wasn't.
She was in the bed.

404
00:35:40,961 --> 00:35:43,748
And that is where
you saw her mammae.

405
00:35:43,964 --> 00:35:46,881
- Her mammal?
- Her honkers, Earl.

406
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:48,420
She dropped the towel.

407
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:51,713
Did she drop it,
or did you psychically will it to fall?

408
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:55,340
- "Will it to fall"?
- Did you will her towel to fall?

409
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,602
No.

410
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,053
Never. No.

411
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:02,559
Admit it, Earl.
They'll go easier on you if you do.

412
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:06,398
Will it to fall?
Well... No, I don't think so.

413
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:08,022
Come on, Earl.

414
00:36:08,614 --> 00:36:11,817
- Well, maybe a little.
- Come on.

415
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:13,570
Yes! Yes!

416
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,111
- Okay, I admit it.
- Admit what?

417
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,579
Yes. I willed the towel to fall!

418
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:29,416
Grab on. Earl Keese, come on up.

419
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:33,217
See, all I wanted was a little honesty
in our relationship, buddy.

420
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:35,547
You'd want the
same thing, right, pal?

421
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,483
Vic.

422
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:47,027
Vic.

423
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:51,779
Don't kid around.

424
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,235
Come on up. Vic!

425
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:06,245
Vic, I'm sorry.
Vic, come back, Vic!

426
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:07,792
Vic, come back.

427
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:16,639
Forgive me, Vic.

428
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:22,145
Forgive me.

429
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:18,277
Oh, my God.

430
00:38:22,247 --> 00:38:24,121
I must be seeing things.

431
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:26,914
So there was this Indian and...

432
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:17,379
Oh, God!

433
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:20,968
Jesus! Get out of here!
Get out!

434
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:23,471
Get out of my house!

435
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:27,554
You're certifiable!
You and that woman!

436
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:31,265
You're nuts!
You're a maniac! Get out!

437
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:59,791
God, does it always
shrivel up when you shower?

438
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:04,558
Great.

439
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,805
Now it's your turn
to annoy me, right?

440
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,267
I was looking for Baby. You haven't
seen him, have you? He kills chickens.

441
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,942
Well, I don't keep
chickens in the shower.

442
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:27,695
- This is pretty.
- Please don't touch them.

443
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:29,873
Put them back on the shelf.

444
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:33,503
Snippy.

445
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:44,298
Your left ball
in the corner pocket.

446
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:54,775
Sorry, Earl.

447
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:58,937
I started collecting them
when I was 9 years old.

448
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:02,322
Hey, you kids,
keep it down to a dull roar.

449
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:04,816
I'm not cleaning up
down there again, Earl.

450
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:07,863
What's happening, gang?

451
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,208
Hi, Vic.
Come on in and join the party.

452
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:14,665
I gotta go upstairs, be right back.

453
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:17,672
I gotta get a broom
to sweep up all this junk.

454
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,583
Get a little rough with you, did he?

455
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:20,801
Hey!

456
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,097
Earl. Hey, Earl.

457
00:41:26,265 --> 00:41:29,598
- Go to hell. You're not getting back in.
- You locked them in?

458
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:32,852
They're a couple of cases.
They're fruitcakes, lunatics.

459
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:37,185
- Both of them. They're hazardous, Enid.
- Enid. You in there, honey?

460
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,068
Right here, Captain Vic.
You can't keep them prisoners, Earl.

461
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,237
I'm gonna call the locksmith.
They can let them out the side door.

462
00:41:46,451 --> 00:41:47,780
Hello, Chic. It's Earl.

463
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:50,409
- Earl. Earl who?
- <i>No jokes, will you?</i>

464
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,407
<i>I need the name of that locksmith.</i>

465
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:55,868
I broke a key and I got
two lunatics locked in my basement.

466
00:41:57,462 --> 00:41:59,206
What? What did you say?

467
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:01,914
- Blow it out your ass.
- Is somebody on this line?

468
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:05,254
- Just you and me, asshole.
- The bastard's on the phone.

469
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,303
- <i>You called me, didn't you?</i>
- <i>Not you.</i>

470
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:08,967
- Me.
- Get off the line, Vic.

471
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:10,635
- Who's Vic?
- <i>He lives next door.</i>

472
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,885
- Nobody lives next door.
- <i>That's right.</i>

473
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,930
- Christ.
- <i>Earl, you been drinking?</i>

474
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:17,892
- What the hell is going on?
- Never mind, forget it.

475
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:20,231
And don't ever call here again.

476
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:24,820
Oh, really, Earl. Grow up.

477
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,818
- Vic, stop!
- Please, you promised me. Please.

478
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:33,329
- Your leg. Just one leg.
- It's a trick.

479
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:35,990
You are pitiful, Earl.
How do you know it's a trick?

480
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:40,296
- You always go limp in a crisis.
- It's not a crisis, it's a trick.

481
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:44,544
How do you know Vic
isn't an escaped vivisectionist?

482
00:42:44,843 --> 00:42:46,587
A vivisectionist!

483
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:53,268
Ramona!

484
00:42:54,895 --> 00:42:57,350
Are you still in one piece?

485
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:16,073
Come on, kids.

486
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,577
Fun's fun.

487
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:29,966
All right. Game's over.

488
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:35,686
Enid!

489
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:37,938
Enid!

490
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:11,255
Greavy's Garage.

491
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:13,678
I'm sorry to be calling you
at this hour.

492
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:18,102
It don't matter. We're open 24 hours.
All day, all damn night. What you need?

493
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,681
<i>I'm at number 2 Burt Street.</i>

494
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:24,144
I need somebody to let me out of my
basement, and a tow truck immediately.

495
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,186
Ain't that damn truck there yet?

496
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:29,031
I sent my boy Perry out there
five minutes ago.

497
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:31,528
<i>Some fella named Vic called up.</i>

498
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:33,195
You're kidding.

499
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,368
Yeah, I'm kidding. I stay up all night
so I can wank my crank on the phone.

500
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,626
Wait a minute.

501
00:44:54,306 --> 00:44:56,797
- He just got here.
- <i>That fella Vic...</i>

502
00:44:56,975 --> 00:44:59,264
<i>... says you run his truck</i>
<i>down the swamp.</i>

503
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:01,476
Locked him and
his missus in a root cellar.

504
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:04,102
- It was kind of a joke.
- A joke?

505
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:08,023
What the hell kind of joke is that?
It's as funny as a gutful of pinworms.

506
00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:11,231
- <i>Who asked your opinion?</i>
- Who the hell has to, jack-off?

507
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:13,939
Just because I lay under
your carpet that's insides...

508
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:16,869
...and because I snake your pipes
and drain your cesspool...

509
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:20,620
...don't make me dirt under your feet.
I'm as good as you any day, asshole.

510
00:45:20,832 --> 00:45:25,126
If I didn't have to do this crap for a
living, I wouldn't sell you my snot.

511
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:41,395
Enid.

512
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:07,583
It's like a peashooter. I saw a guy
take three slugs from one of these.

513
00:46:07,754 --> 00:46:09,961
- He just kept coming.
- I remember that.

514
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:12,290
- Be cool, brothers.
- Take it easy, guys.

515
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:15,219
- You too. Good night.
- Look who's home.

516
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:18,388
- Our daughter, the outlaw hitchhiker.
- Hi, Daddy.

517
00:46:18,557 --> 00:46:22,471
- Elaine, what are you doing home?
- Got kicked out of school. I'm hungry.

518
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:26,938
We're gonna party with the neighbours.
Aren't they neat? I got some vodka.

519
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:28,940
- She got kicked out.
- Leave her alone.

520
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:31,102
Vic, what did you say
is in a pile driver?

521
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:34,896
Italian Galliano for passion,
Irish Mist for love and...

522
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:38,324
...Russian vodka for endurance.
- Poor baby. Learn to relax.

523
00:46:38,702 --> 00:46:40,778
Too much excitement's
no good for you.

524
00:46:40,954 --> 00:46:45,332
Why don't you go upstairs,
take a hot bath, get into bed...

525
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,035
...and I'll come up to tuck
you in and help you go to sleep.

526
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:50,914
That's a good idea.

527
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:54,708
- I'll go in and say good night.
- That's a good boy.

528
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,753
We used to put
20 of them in there.

529
00:46:56,929 --> 00:47:00,298
Activate the speed rollers, turn on
the hose circuits and that's it.

530
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:02,804
Vic Zeck's liquid lunch!

531
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:05,061
Good night, everybody.

532
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:08,346
I'm going to bed.

533
00:47:08,565 --> 00:47:11,851
I bet you never seen
a pair of these before.

534
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:13,938
Take a sniff.

535
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:21,364
- It smells like a peach.
- What are those?

536
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:23,529
They're my panties. They're edible.

537
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:27,833
Edible. Hey, wow. The wonders of
modern petro technology.

538
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:31,370
- Where'd you get them?
- At school. All the kids have them.

539
00:47:31,922 --> 00:47:34,247
- They're tasty.
- They come in four flavours.

540
00:47:34,424 --> 00:47:36,998
- What a great idea.
- Yeah. Four flavours.

541
00:47:37,177 --> 00:47:40,546
Earl, want some of your daughter's
panties? They come in four flavours.

542
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:44,257
Banana, peach, mint,
and, of course, cherry.

543
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,058
Good night, ladies.

544
00:47:57,114 --> 00:47:59,605
You should have gone
up to bed like I said.

545
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,655
Nice meeting you.
Good night, Enid.

546
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:14,582
- Nice, Earl. Good move.
- Guys, it's 2 in the morning.

547
00:48:14,756 --> 00:48:16,832
Come on, you need some sleep.

548
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:20,301
Turn off the lights, Earl.

549
00:48:20,554 --> 00:48:22,639
Two? 2:00?

550
00:48:23,307 --> 00:48:26,308
Is that right? Can that be right?

551
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:04,467
What do you want?

552
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:08,809
Please let me in, Earl.
I'll give you a kiss. Anyplace you like.

553
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:11,313
Oh, Christ.

554
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:17,566
You've got no interest in me.
Why are you coming on to me?

555
00:49:17,778 --> 00:49:21,478
We could have a real good time, Earl.
I don't care about your false teeth.

556
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:26,159
- I haven't got false teeth.
- I'm sorry. I guess they just look false.

557
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,324
Look, what do you want from me?

558
00:49:29,498 --> 00:49:34,705
Not just now, the whole thing.
You and Vic. Why?

559
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,083
Poor baby. I guess no one ever
tried to make friends with you before.

560
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:40,342
Here.

561
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:45,753
Earl, if you won't
let me come in and play...

562
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:48,137
...you come out and play with me.
- Earl.

563
00:49:48,308 --> 00:49:49,803
- Just for a little while.
- Earl.

564
00:49:50,018 --> 00:49:52,640
- We can talk.
- Earl, are you down there?

565
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,314
Coming.

566
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:58,724
Wait. Stay here. I'll be right back.

567
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,529
Who were you
talking to down there?

568
00:50:10,873 --> 00:50:12,830
Talking to? Nobody.

569
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:15,377
Well.

570
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:19,586
I'm gonna take a shower.

571
00:50:20,048 --> 00:50:22,041
Whatever you say, Earl.

572
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,000
Ramona.

573
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:46,134
Ramona.

574
00:51:49,513 --> 00:51:53,676
- Well, that was a huge waste of time.
- What do you want?

575
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:58,563
I give your car a good going-over,
a real good going-over.

576
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,894
And there's nothing wrong with it.
Not a damn thing. So I brung it back.

577
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:05,769
I guess you had a
good laugh on me, huh?

578
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:08,437
- Pardon?
- Making a horse's patoot out of me.

579
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:11,320
- Yeah, huh?
- Wait. I didn't ask to have my...

580
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:14,945
...car hauled away. Someone
played a joke on both of us.

581
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:16,949
You're just full of jokes, aren't you?

582
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:20,290
Well, I think you're a dirty
shit sack, how about that?

583
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,199
Ramona.

584
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:06,624
Who goes there?

585
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:11,004
Hi. It's Earl Keese.

586
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:15,681
Oh, God!

587
00:53:19,937 --> 00:53:21,605
Oh, God.

588
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:35,201
My God, I thought you were a prowler.
You all right?

589
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:37,492
- I guess so.
- You look bad, Earl.

590
00:53:37,704 --> 00:53:39,199
You sure you didn't get hit?

591
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:41,780
I don't know.
I've never been shot at before.

592
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:44,414
What were you doing out here?
What was that noise?

593
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:47,504
- What are you up to now?
- Nothing.

594
00:53:48,715 --> 00:53:50,957
Bet you're looking
for Ramona, aren't you?

595
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:55,340
- No.
- You're rooting around for Ramona.

596
00:53:56,557 --> 00:54:00,471
I'm not rooting around.
She wanted to talk.

597
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:03,182
She wanted to talk?

598
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:07,015
Well, actually,
I wanted to talk to someone.

599
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:08,609
You wanna talk to me?

600
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:10,988
Sure.

601
00:54:19,162 --> 00:54:21,488
Come on. Inside.

602
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:43,143
Grab a seat,
I'll fix us some coffee.

603
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:07,493
I feel terrible about your eye.

604
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:10,415
Couldn't be helped.

605
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:17,882
What are you doing
with all that stuff on?

606
00:55:18,096 --> 00:55:22,141
I was gonna take a dive in the swamp,
try to locate my truck and airplane.

607
00:55:30,275 --> 00:55:34,273
I remember Mrs. Warren used
to bake bread in this kitchen.

608
00:55:34,446 --> 00:55:37,981
I could smell the bread
all the way over at my house.

609
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:54,920
- Instant okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:14,645
Better get that fixed.

611
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,869
- Strong?
- Well, not too.

612
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:40,302
- I gotta rinse this out.
- And waste that coffee?

613
00:56:42,222 --> 00:56:45,259
I'll just put it someplace
until I wash out the cup.

614
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:57,194
Sit down, Earl.

615
00:56:57,362 --> 00:56:59,818
- I just want to...
- Sit down.

616
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:12,288
Now, just put the coffee powder
back in the cup.

617
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:24,587
- Can I wash my hand?
- No.

618
00:57:24,765 --> 00:57:27,516
I thought you came over here to talk.

619
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:38,569
I like mine tepid and black.
How about you?

620
00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:39,821
Same.

621
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:58,047
Now you take back that cup you keep
switching, Earl. Or it'll be pump city.

622
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:03,249
Well, it makes no difference to me.

623
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:18,360
So.

624
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,104
Here we are.

625
00:58:23,907 --> 00:58:26,944
It's about your daughter,
Elaine, isn't it?

626
00:58:27,828 --> 00:58:29,619
I thought so.

627
00:58:30,497 --> 00:58:32,822
I'd say you got a
real problem there, Earl.

628
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,158
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

629
00:58:35,335 --> 00:58:37,292
Drugs. I can tell.

630
00:58:37,754 --> 00:58:39,712
That spaced-out look.

631
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:42,882
Used to see it in dust cases
the state police brought in...

632
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:45,887
...when I was night custody chief
at Oakville Mental.

633
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:50,099
Yeah, she's got the dries. She
always keeps licking her lips.

634
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:53,850
- She was dying for a fix.
- She has never taken drugs in her life.

635
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:58,517
- Never!
- Well, it was just a wild guess.

636
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:07,947
They think she stole a ring at school.
I just can't believe it.

637
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,248
Is that all? I thought there was
some kind of major catastrophe.

638
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,370
She's been expelled, for God's sake.

639
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:20,462
I can think of a problem
that's more important...

640
00:59:20,631 --> 00:59:22,956
...and you, as a parent,
are ignoring it.

641
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:24,176
What?

642
00:59:25,177 --> 00:59:29,044
What is Elaine doing about sex?
Is she getting probed?

643
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:32,389
That was very foolish, Earl.
And it could get you snuffed!

644
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:42,353
Why do I keep getting sucked
into these degrading conversations?

645
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:47,689
Why should I assume that suddenly
you'll turn into a human being?

646
00:59:47,908 --> 00:59:50,316
Both you or Ramona.

647
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,218
Enid?

648
01:00:52,472 --> 01:00:55,592
- Yes, Earl?
- Why is this door locked?

649
01:01:01,982 --> 01:01:06,443
Is that the dog?
Enid, is that goddamn dog in there?

650
01:01:06,612 --> 01:01:10,989
It's all right.
He's housebroken. Almost.

651
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:16,613
What the hell is going on in there?

652
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:39,350
Enid?
Do you realise how this looks?

653
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,766
Should have slipped it through the mail
slot while you had the chance, Earl.

654
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:48,691
This is going to take explaining, Enid.
A helluva lot of explaining.

655
01:01:50,113 --> 01:01:53,482
- Daddy, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

656
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:56,494
- I was talking to your mother.
- Through the door?

657
01:01:56,662 --> 01:02:00,611
- It wasn't very important. Go to sleep.
- I just got up.

658
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,542
Okay, then do that, then.

659
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:18,764
How about this?
Beautiful morning, huh?

660
01:02:19,017 --> 01:02:21,591
Somebody really did
a number on your front end here.

661
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,435
Not to worry. I know a gypsy
in the city does cheap bodywork.

662
01:02:25,774 --> 01:02:29,392
Somebody wrote something here too.
Said "pimp wagon."

663
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,064
You know who wrote that.

664
01:02:31,238 --> 01:02:33,480
Why would I let
anybody write on your car?

665
01:02:33,657 --> 01:02:36,326
I gotta use this buggy today,
to get us breakfast.

666
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:38,320
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

667
01:02:38,495 --> 01:02:42,540
- Just you and me?
- Yeah. Right. Who needs the women?

668
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:47,535
You know, personally, I think if it'd
just been us guys last night...

669
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:50,376
...we wouldn't have had any trouble.
- Really?

670
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:53,087
I know women,
upside down and backwards...

671
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,751
...which is not a bad way
to know them, huh?

672
01:02:55,929 --> 01:02:59,630
I guess so. Say, what does
that say on your arm?

673
01:03:02,102 --> 01:03:07,772
- "Born to party."
- It's the way I live, babe. Have a cigar.

674
01:03:12,029 --> 01:03:13,938
You ever seen one of these?

675
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,367
Wow.

676
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:20,444
You know what you and I need?

677
01:03:20,704 --> 01:03:23,409
- A boys' night out.
- Yeah.

678
01:03:23,624 --> 01:03:26,494
- You fool around?
- Yeah, sure.

679
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,079
Good. Keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna get us breakfast.

680
01:03:30,255 --> 01:03:32,877
I hope you like
blueberry pancakes and sausage.

681
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,089
- That's what you're getting.
- Sounds great.

682
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,217
Not the way I fix them.

683
01:04:10,754 --> 01:04:12,663
Get your foot off the gas!

684
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:16,125
Well, watch the lever. Put your...!

685
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:19,053
Stop. Pull up, you jerk.
Back up.

686
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:20,596
What...?

687
01:04:20,764 --> 01:04:25,971
Stop it. Watch where you're going.
Stop. Would you stop? You stupid shit!

688
01:04:26,144 --> 01:04:28,386
I ought to crush
your head with a mallet.

689
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:32,685
The kid's an animal.
You got the keys?

690
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,647
It's not my truck.
The owner went to get breakfast.

691
01:04:35,904 --> 01:04:37,648
I hear you got a whore in there.

692
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:39,317
- Who told you that?
- I heard.

693
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:41,484
- Well you heard wrong.
- Ain't got a whore?

694
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,154
- No.
- Know where to find one?

695
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:46,448
- Of course not.
- If one shows up, you let me know?

696
01:04:53,046 --> 01:04:55,751
Careful. That mother freaking
snap back between...

697
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:58,925
...your legs and lash your
whacker off something fierce.

698
01:05:05,893 --> 01:05:06,935
Well.

699
01:05:08,103 --> 01:05:13,014
It doesn't look too bad, does it?
I don't think we'll have to tow it away.

700
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:16,191
Am I right?

701
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:20,698
You the bastard that mouthed off
to my dad last night?

702
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:23,940
He smashed my car and
he punched me in the stomach.

703
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,863
Oh, yeah?

704
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:30,122
How would you like your
nuts nailed to your forehead, huh?

705
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:33,957
Hey. Leave that wart-head alone.
Come on, we got cesspools to suck.

706
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:35,831
Okay, Dad.

707
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:39,126
You're lucky.

708
01:05:39,343 --> 01:05:44,717
I gotta go help my dad now.
But I'll be back.

709
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:15,160
Hey, Vic. They got your truck.

710
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:19,544
Looks as good as new.
Not a scratch on it.

711
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:21,715
Well, where's breakfast?

712
01:06:22,302 --> 01:06:24,010
Not a scratch?

713
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:31,508
The rear axle's broken.

714
01:06:31,812 --> 01:06:34,184
Well, I'll get it fixed. It's only fair.

715
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:39,101
- Forget it. Give it a decent burial.
- You don't want your truck?

716
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:41,069
You don't get it, do you?

717
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,110
I'm moving. Away.

718
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:54,198
Moving? What do you mean, moving?
You haven't been here 24 hours yet.

719
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:56,285
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. That swamp.

720
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:59,035
In the summer, it must be
a swing club for mosquitoes.

721
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:00,958
The county sprays.
It's no problem.

722
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:03,540
Those lines,
they're too close to the house.

723
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,007
They cause hair loss,
lumbar ecstimiosis...

724
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,053
...post cortical lesions and impotency.

725
01:07:08,223 --> 01:07:09,552
It's just a myth.

726
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:13,094
The power company wouldn't
put them up if they were dangerous.

727
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,352
Of course, it's your right to move,
I guess.

728
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:21,692
But as far as I'm concerned,
I'd honestly like you to stay.

729
01:07:21,862 --> 01:07:23,356
You would?

730
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,857
Well, to tell you the truth...

731
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:29,566
...I haven't got
any friends around here.

732
01:07:30,704 --> 01:07:34,868
I mean it.
As crazy as last night was...

733
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:38,001
...even though I hated your guts
through most of it...

734
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,712
...I really had...

735
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,422
...a good time.

736
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:44,419
Good time.

737
01:07:44,676 --> 01:07:49,587
I can't remember a better time
on any Friday night I've ever had.

738
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:51,217
Neither can I.

739
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:53,384
I bet Ramona doesn't wanna move,
does she?

740
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,431
She's not moving.
You can have her. She's all paid for.

741
01:07:57,523 --> 01:08:00,856
This is another joke.
Of course you're gonna take your wife.

742
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:02,769
She might come in handy.

743
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:06,610
- Who says she's my wife?
- She's not your wife?

744
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:09,024
- Whose wife is she?
- I couldn't care less.

745
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:11,870
If you want her, she's yours.
With my compliments.

746
01:08:12,037 --> 01:08:14,742
Well, I gotta pack.
It's been nice knowing you.

747
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:19,953
Enid. Open this door.

748
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,877
It's open.

749
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:27,635
Where's Enid?

750
01:08:29,095 --> 01:08:32,714
What the hell's going on in here?
Why was that door locked before?

751
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,301
Where's my wife?

752
01:08:34,518 --> 01:08:35,977
She's your wife.

753
01:08:36,185 --> 01:08:38,973
Oh, yeah? Well, you know
what Vic just told me?

754
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:40,642
- What?
- He's moving.

755
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,773
Moving away.
And leaving you here.

756
01:08:42,943 --> 01:08:45,814
He said I could have you.
What do you think about that?

757
01:08:46,113 --> 01:08:49,067
- Sounds exciting.
- I'm serious.

758
01:08:49,283 --> 01:08:50,951
So am I.

759
01:08:54,037 --> 01:08:56,113
For God's sake,
Ramona, cover yourself.

760
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,867
Come on.

761
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:01,874
- People just don't do this kind of thing.
- But we could.

762
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:05,624
Don't worry about Enid.

763
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:10,176
She's not around.
We won't be disturbed.

764
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:14,510
Come on, before it gets cold.

765
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,011
I can't.

766
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,426
I know. You're worried about Vic.

767
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:21,225
No, I'm not worried about Vic.

768
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:23,604
- He's next door packing.
- All right, baby.

769
01:09:23,817 --> 01:09:26,569
- Baby, watch it. All right, sweetheart.
- Oh, boy.

770
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:30,772
One time.
All right. All right, sweetie.

771
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:35,533
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

772
01:09:35,746 --> 01:09:39,078
All right. Looking good.

773
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:44,961
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

774
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:47,046
Jesus, what a case.

775
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,374
Two minutes ago, he said
he was moving away.

776
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:51,129
I think Vic was right about you.

777
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:53,090
About what?

778
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:58,049
He said up is definitely not
your direction.

779
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:01,719
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

780
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:04,566
Okay, we'll just see about that.

781
01:10:04,775 --> 01:10:07,480
That's my little sweetheart. All right.

782
01:10:08,612 --> 01:10:14,697
All right, dive, baby, dive.
Let's see a screaming dive. All right.

783
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:17,538
- Hi, neighbour.
- Hi.

784
01:10:17,704 --> 01:10:22,662
Now, I'm just gonna go under
the covers and take a little inventory.

785
01:10:22,834 --> 01:10:27,829
- Promise you won't go away.
- I promise.

786
01:10:28,006 --> 01:10:32,549
What beautiful performance. Beautiful.
Watch that mixture, watch that mixture.

787
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,003
All right, all right.

788
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:39,716
All right, that's my sweetie.
Good, climb, baby, climb.

789
01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:41,601
Come on, Earl.

790
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,522
I can't concentrate. It's Vic's plane.

791
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:49,316
That's it. Watch it.
Watch that mixture, take it easy.

792
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:56,401
Good. He stopped.

793
01:11:01,748 --> 01:11:04,500
Earl. Earl, come quick!

794
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:09,918
Where are you, are you
upstairs? Earl?

795
01:11:11,175 --> 01:11:14,875
- Vic, what happened?
- We're losing the house, babe.

796
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,635
Vic's house is on fire.

797
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,388
Did you call the fire department?

798
01:11:23,562 --> 01:11:27,180
My phone's dead.
Your phone's dead too.

799
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:32,607
Water, water.

800
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:37,567
Look. Look, there's no fire.
It's a trick.

801
01:11:39,786 --> 01:11:41,115
Oh, it was terrible.

802
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,536
I had her up to 100 feet.
Everything was great.

803
01:11:43,707 --> 01:11:45,035
Then the controls jammed.

804
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,620
I think it was that tower.

805
01:11:47,794 --> 01:11:51,045
- My signal couldn't get to the servos.
- Poor baby.

806
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:53,415
The motor cut out.
I knew it was in the soup.

807
01:11:53,592 --> 01:11:56,961
She went into a vertical spin,
hit the power lines, bounced up.

808
01:11:57,137 --> 01:11:59,379
And then she climbed 300 feet.

809
01:11:59,973 --> 01:12:03,342
You should've seen her.
She was magnificent.

810
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:07,018
She just sort of stopped
and hung there.

811
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,894
Then she nosed over and came
straight down into my attic.

812
01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:13,602
- The fuel pods exploded in seconds.
- Jesus.

813
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,567
I stamped on the flames,
and everything spread so fast.

814
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,400
That old house is like a matchbox.

815
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:21,944
If you hadn't had the keys to the car,
he could have driven to a phone.

816
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,703
- What about his truck?
- You broke his rear axle, Daddy.

817
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:35,374
All right, here, then. It works.

818
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,958
Go ahead. Call the fire department.

819
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:41,054
You see, he won't even use
the phone.

820
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,548
This is just another one of
his cheap tricks.

821
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:46,726
Isn't that right, Vic?

822
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,389
Look at him, Enid.

823
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:53,272
You're fawning all over a fake,
a phoney and a fraud.

824
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:04,576
- Hey, brother, how about a beer?
- No, thank you.

825
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,832
Look at that thing go.

826
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,128
- What's wrong with the water?
- No pressure. Can't you see?

827
01:13:12,296 --> 01:13:15,712
- Well, what can we do about it?
- I know what we can do.

828
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,881
- What?
- Get some marshmallows.

829
01:13:33,066 --> 01:13:35,777
Enid. Elaine.

830
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:40,566
Relax. They're all gone.
They left in your car.

831
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,574
Elaine had a key.

832
01:13:42,743 --> 01:13:44,700
Vic made a trade.

833
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,862
All of them for me.

834
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:53,662
It's been less than 24 hours since
you and Vic moved in next door.

835
01:13:56,215 --> 01:13:59,465
- It seems like years.
- A lot has happened.

836
01:14:00,844 --> 01:14:02,920
You gonna miss Vic?

837
01:14:03,096 --> 01:14:04,139
Vic?

838
01:14:05,349 --> 01:14:07,140
I don't know.

839
01:14:07,684 --> 01:14:09,973
He was fantastic in bed.

840
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:11,937
Until I got in it.

841
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:16,692
You know, it's really great
that you can...

842
01:14:17,277 --> 01:14:21,357
...admit things like that
in your relationship.

843
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:24,942
You're really wonderful.

844
01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:30,039
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

845
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:37,918
Is it so hard having your fantasies
come to life?

846
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:44,422
There's not a single living thing
left on this road...

847
01:14:44,596 --> 01:14:46,921
...except you and me.

848
01:14:47,474 --> 01:14:51,768
You know what we're gonna do now,
Earl, just you and me?

849
01:14:53,605 --> 01:14:54,648
What?

850
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,393
Have breakfast. Are you hungry?

851
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:03,274
I'm starving, but there's no food
in the house.

852
01:15:03,448 --> 01:15:05,441
Well, if you have ketchup
and hot water...

853
01:15:05,617 --> 01:15:07,361
...I could make you tomato soup.

854
01:15:07,995 --> 01:15:09,037
Hey.

855
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:12,913
I got a better idea. We'll go to the city.
We'll go anyplace you like.

856
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,325
What kind of food?
French, Spanish, fish?

857
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:17,747
- I like Greek.
- Greek. Great.

858
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:19,748
I know a great Greek restaurant.

859
01:15:19,923 --> 01:15:22,165
- I'll go get a cab. I'll get ready...
- Oh, Earl?

860
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:23,594
Yeah?

861
01:15:25,012 --> 01:15:28,961
I know just who I want for dessert.

862
01:16:53,225 --> 01:16:54,685
Ramona.

863
01:16:55,769 --> 01:16:57,229
Ramona?

864
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,279
Ramona?

865
01:17:14,955 --> 01:17:16,415
Ramona.

866
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:20,452
Surprise!

867
01:17:20,627 --> 01:17:22,205
See, buddy, I got you breakfast.

868
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:24,870
Hey, Daddy, Vic brought
my five favourite junkfoods.

869
01:17:25,048 --> 01:17:28,382
Elaine, get out the china. We'll inhale
this poison on the good stuff.

870
01:17:28,552 --> 01:17:32,300
- Where's all that plum sauce?
- It's in here, it's in here. Wait a second.

871
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:06,918
Would you like some wine, Enid?

872
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,508
You know, I've been thinking, Enid.

873
01:18:15,432 --> 01:18:17,757
For the past couple of years...

874
01:18:17,935 --> 01:18:20,342
...things around here have been...

875
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,391
...stagnant.

876
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:26,313
Not uncomfortable, mind you, but...

877
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:29,058
...changeless. Tedious.

878
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,273
Except for last night,
with Vic and Ramona.

879
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,899
They're a sign. They're a revelation.

880
01:18:35,118 --> 01:18:38,653
They're squeezing the maximum yield
out of life.

881
01:18:39,373 --> 01:18:41,698
Let's get back to the world
of the living.

882
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:45,291
Let's move back to the city.
Or move to the country.

883
01:18:45,462 --> 01:18:47,751
I mean, this is neither.

884
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:50,715
What do you say?

885
01:18:51,176 --> 01:18:53,632
I understand your restlessness, Earl.

886
01:18:53,804 --> 01:18:55,843
But true change comes only
from within.

887
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:58,007
- Would you pass the wine?
- You feel it too?

888
01:18:58,183 --> 01:18:59,725
Not a bit.

889
01:18:59,893 --> 01:19:02,563
But I do think the city would be
a good idea.

890
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:04,058
For you, in any case.

891
01:19:04,982 --> 01:19:06,974
But I meant for both of us.

892
01:19:07,192 --> 01:19:09,019
If we had the money...

893
01:19:09,403 --> 01:19:11,728
...I think I'd go back to school.

894
01:19:11,905 --> 01:19:13,697
I'd like to...

895
01:19:13,866 --> 01:19:17,863
...intensify my Native American
art studies.

896
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:20,409
We'll have the money.
We'll sell the house.

897
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:23,154
Vic, here, will buy it.
He's rolling in dough.

898
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:26,916
Why do you think he crashed his plane
into his house and burned it down?

899
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,540
Why, Daddy?

900
01:19:28,755 --> 01:19:31,163
For the insurance money. Right, Vic?

901
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:33,879
How much you have the old place
insured for?

902
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,260
He didn't have any insurance.

903
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:39,091
He never does.

904
01:19:39,516 --> 01:19:40,892
Of course he had insurance.

905
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:44,345
The bank wouldn't give him a mortgage
without insurance.

906
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:48,687
He didn't have a mortgage.

907
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,401
You paid cash?

908
01:19:53,197 --> 01:19:55,154
You rented?

909
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:58,107
Do you remember
when your neighbour, Mrs. Warren...

910
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:01,244
...moved to Riverside Nursing Home
after her husband died?

911
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:03,785
Well, that's when we met her.

912
01:20:04,708 --> 01:20:06,499
Vic used to dress her all the time.

913
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:10,545
Mrs. Warren would always
ask for Vic.

914
01:20:11,798 --> 01:20:13,625
Well, when she died...

915
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,793
...the house was empty,
so we moved in.

916
01:20:17,596 --> 01:20:19,802
Vic said she wouldn't mind.

917
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:23,639
I said it was a steal.

918
01:20:26,063 --> 01:20:28,269
This is really something.

919
01:20:28,732 --> 01:20:31,519
You two ought to be on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

920
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:36,899
Yeah, but now we don't have
no place to live.

921
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:40,319
Daddy, they could live in my room.

922
01:20:40,494 --> 01:20:42,949
Dick's invited me to Florida
for a couple of weeks.

923
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:45,244
His mom won't be there.
She said it's okay.

924
01:20:45,415 --> 01:20:48,784
You stay out of this. You're not going
anywhere and Dick is off-limits.

925
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:51,998
Maybe that's not a bad idea
that Elaine had.

926
01:20:52,172 --> 01:20:54,165
I mean, they could stay
in the guest room.

927
01:20:54,341 --> 01:20:57,591
I don't know. That room's loaded
with a lot of furniture and junk.

928
01:20:57,761 --> 01:21:00,762
If we did stay, we'd really need
the big room, facing the road.

929
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:02,841
The master bedroom?

930
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,383
Hey, don't worry, we'd earn our keep
around here.

931
01:21:05,602 --> 01:21:06,931
How wonderful.

932
01:21:07,104 --> 01:21:08,931
- No heavy yard work, though.
- Hernia.

933
01:21:09,106 --> 01:21:11,312
Well, I don't know, it is my bedroom.

934
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:14,520
I kind of have a sentimental
attachment to it.

935
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:16,023
I'll tell you what.

936
01:21:16,196 --> 01:21:18,023
With a scrub-down
and some carpentry...

937
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:20,606
...we could make conditions liveable
in the garage.

938
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:22,065
Garage, huh?

939
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:26,368
Right. That's it, then.
Ramona, let's hit the road.

940
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:29,618
Please. Look, I was just kidding.

941
01:21:29,835 --> 01:21:32,871
I want you to stay. Both of you.
You're worth it.

942
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,123
Please stay.

943
01:21:35,299 --> 01:21:36,757
As my friends.

944
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,378
Please.

945
01:21:43,557 --> 01:21:46,048
Stay here, in the outer limits
of the dead-end zone?

946
01:21:46,476 --> 01:21:49,146
Nothing personal, but life
at the end of the road...

947
01:21:49,354 --> 01:21:52,806
...just ain't for Captain Vic
and Empress Ramona.

948
01:21:52,983 --> 01:21:57,360
Sorry, folks, but you can
colour us gone.

949
01:22:00,574 --> 01:22:03,777
Boy, they were neat.

950
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:07,028
They were beyond neat.

951
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:10,115
They were extraordinary...

952
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,119
...unique...

953
01:22:12,878 --> 01:22:14,870
...special.

954
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:16,790
Earl, can you write me a check?

955
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,836
I'm gonna need some money
this week.

956
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:23,430
- How much?
- How much is in the account?

957
01:22:23,597 --> 01:22:24,925
I don't know.

958
01:22:25,098 --> 01:22:27,091
Where's the checkbook?

959
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:30,304
The checkbook!

960
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:33,972
- I'm hungry again. You wanna eat?
- Oh, yeah.

961
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:38,194
Hold it. Hold it right there, folks.

962
01:22:41,365 --> 01:22:43,322
All right.

963
01:22:43,742 --> 01:22:45,402
Let me have it.

964
01:22:45,577 --> 01:22:47,451
What are you talking about
now, Earl?

965
01:22:47,621 --> 01:22:51,369
My checkbook. Not that there's
any money left in my account.

966
01:22:51,542 --> 01:22:53,000
That's what you think of me?

967
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:55,837
I take your hospitality,
I break bread with your family.

968
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,499
You still think I'd rob you?

969
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,333
Look, just give me the checkbook.

970
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:03,553
I'm not even gonna talk about
the $32 you stole from me last night...

971
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,713
...when you were
supposed to get dinner...

972
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:08,297
...and cooked that bogus
spaghetti meal instead.

973
01:23:08,475 --> 01:23:09,804
Your checkbook.

974
01:23:09,977 --> 01:23:12,384
It's on the table in the hall,
next to your wallet.

975
01:23:12,563 --> 01:23:15,978
My wallet! Enid?
Look on the table in the hall.

976
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,563
Do you see my wallet
and checkbook there?

977
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:21,935
Elaine, get ready to call the police.

978
01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:23,991
Oh, Earl.

979
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,239
Hey. Kojak.

980
01:23:26,451 --> 01:23:28,491
How much is left in the account?

981
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:33,790
There's $310 left in the account.

982
01:23:33,959 --> 01:23:37,909
Vic spent $17 on pants and a shirt
from Goodwill.

983
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:42,833
And there's a receipt here for $32...

984
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:45,002
...from Mr. Fong's Fast Chow.

985
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:48,630
Do you want me to call
the National Guard now, Daddy?

986
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:50,432
- Elaine, get the car.
- What for?

987
01:23:50,601 --> 01:23:53,008
Just do as I ask.

988
01:23:53,187 --> 01:23:54,646
Please.

989
01:23:55,147 --> 01:23:56,855
Give me the wallet.

990
01:23:58,066 --> 01:23:59,976
All right, now...

991
01:24:00,152 --> 01:24:02,773
...I don't want any argument
about this.

992
01:24:03,363 --> 01:24:07,693
This is the least I can do after all
the trouble I've put you two through.

993
01:24:07,868 --> 01:24:11,153
I just hope that someday
you can forgive me.

994
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,038
- Here.
- What's that?

995
01:24:13,207 --> 01:24:14,831
It's his vehicle registration.

996
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,456
He just signed over his car to us.

997
01:24:17,628 --> 01:24:18,956
Really, Earl?

998
01:24:19,129 --> 01:24:21,537
Yes. It's all yours.

999
01:24:21,715 --> 01:24:25,250
L... I want you to have it...

1000
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:28,096
...because, well...

1001
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,470
Because I just want you to have it...

1002
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:33,345
...and to get safely to wherever
you're going.

1003
01:24:33,519 --> 01:24:37,647
And, maybe, time and again, you might
think about your old neighbours...

1004
01:24:37,814 --> 01:24:39,143
...here on Burt Street.

1005
01:24:39,316 --> 01:24:41,439
What's happening, Daddy?

1006
01:24:42,152 --> 01:24:45,355
Your old man just gave me
his car, honey.

1007
01:24:45,531 --> 01:24:48,567
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, you don't have to say anything.

1008
01:24:48,742 --> 01:24:50,284
It doesn't seem enough.

1009
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:52,077
Oh, Earl.

1010
01:24:52,246 --> 01:24:55,791
You are the best.

1011
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:59,576
Hey, come on. Take it easy,
super stud.

1012
01:24:59,753 --> 01:25:01,911
You make me look bad.

1013
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:10,884
So make sure you take care
of my little Burt Street beauties.

1014
01:25:11,056 --> 01:25:13,179
- I'll try.
- All right.

1015
01:25:16,562 --> 01:25:18,186
Some time we had, huh?

1016
01:25:18,355 --> 01:25:20,928
Don't drive too long.
You haven't had much sleep.

1017
01:25:21,108 --> 01:25:23,350
Remember those shots
I took at you last night?

1018
01:25:23,569 --> 01:25:24,897
Yeah, I remember.

1019
01:25:25,112 --> 01:25:26,523
Come here.

1020
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:31,115
I knew it was you.
That's why I missed.

1021
01:25:31,994 --> 01:25:33,369
Thanks, Vic.

1022
01:25:33,537 --> 01:25:36,324
Oh, I almost forgot.
Check the sticker on the door panel.

1023
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:38,989
She'll need an oil change
in about 1000 miles.

1024
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:42,038
Use Wolf's Head Golden 30-weight.

1025
01:25:42,212 --> 01:25:43,588
It'll never let you down.

1026
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:45,838
Thanks, buddy.

1027
01:25:49,261 --> 01:25:51,052
Okay, pal.

1028
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:54,175
- Bye, folks.
- Goodbye.

1029
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,887
Oh, we'll miss you.
I wish you weren't going.

1030
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,267
- Don't forget to write, huh?
- Bye.

1031
01:25:59,438 --> 01:26:01,680
Be cool, guys.

1032
01:26:20,209 --> 01:26:22,782
<i>And now back to</i>
<i>our afternoon feature...</i>

1033
01:26:22,961 --> 01:26:26,626
...Redstone Romance, <i>starring</i>
<i>Clive Brecker...</i>

1034
01:26:26,798 --> 01:26:29,550
<i>... Marjorie Crane and Sky Saxon.</i>

1035
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:33,336
Hey, Dad, thanks.
It was far-out. Goodbye.

1036
01:26:33,514 --> 01:26:35,221
- Where you going?
- Back to school.

1037
01:26:36,266 --> 01:26:38,389
Back to school?
I thought you got kicked out.

1038
01:26:38,602 --> 01:26:42,682
Connie Schiff confessed.
They threw her out and cleared me.

1039
01:26:42,856 --> 01:26:46,724
Oh, that's my ride. I gotta go
or I'll miss the train. Bye, Dad.

1040
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,409
- Elaine, I don't want you in that truck!
- I can't hear you.

1041
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:59,990
I'll call you next week. Don't forget
to mail my allowance. Bye.

1042
01:27:00,165 --> 01:27:02,573
See you later, wart-head.

1043
01:27:08,549 --> 01:27:10,837
Bye, Daddy.

1044
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:22,139
Where are you going?

1045
01:27:22,312 --> 01:27:26,061
Oh, I have an emergency meeting of my
Native American art study circle.

1046
01:27:26,233 --> 01:27:29,353
- Where'd that getup come from?
- It was a present.

1047
01:27:29,528 --> 01:27:31,070
Oh, that must be Mr. Thundersky.

1048
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:34,322
- Mr. Thundersky?
- My ride.

1049
01:27:34,491 --> 01:27:38,619
- Who the hell is that?
- Don't wait up. Bye.

1050
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:30,079
<i>Hello. I'm Charles Haults, president</i>

<i>The time to choose your case is now.</i>

1065
01:29:21,265 --> 01:29:22,724
Ramona!

1066
01:29:23,141 --> 01:29:25,218
I see you still have
the same old wallpaper.

1067
01:29:25,394 --> 01:29:26,436
Hey.

1068
01:29:26,937 --> 01:29:28,976
You two make a sharp couple.

1069
01:29:29,773 --> 01:29:32,311
You wouldn't believe it.
It happened at the same time.

1070
01:29:32,484 --> 01:29:35,900
Vic stared at me. I stared at him.
We both knew it was wrong.

1071
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:38,194
It's just not gonna be any fun
without you.

1072
01:29:38,365 --> 01:29:40,737
Honest? Does that mean you'll stay?

1073
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:43,400
- We've got plenty of room.
- No, no. We're past that.

1074
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:46,414
- You're coming with us.
- Really?

1075
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:49,120
Me come with you?
No, you don't mean it.

1076
01:29:49,293 --> 01:29:51,166
Sure we mean it. It'll be a blast.

1077
01:29:51,336 --> 01:29:54,006
Come on, let's go. We're getting old.

1078
01:29:55,007 --> 01:29:57,794
- The dishwasher's on.
- It'll stay on.

1079
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:06,549
All right, damn it. You're on.
Let's do it.

1080
01:30:06,727 --> 01:30:09,930
This is crazy, but there's something
so right about it. Let's go.

1081
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:14,352
- Hold it. Not so fast, pal.
- What?

1082
01:30:14,526 --> 01:30:18,394
Don't you think you should
leave a note for Enid?

1083
01:30:18,572 --> 01:30:24,326
You're right. In fact, I'll leave
a little more than just a note.

1084
01:31:40,904 --> 01:31:45,483
No, no, no. Up front,
right next to Captain Vic.

1085
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:47,533
- Where are we going?
- How should I know?

1086
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:50,324
You tell me. I'm just driving.

1087
01:32:01,508 --> 01:32:04,545
- Off into the land of the great unknown.
- Look.

1088
01:32:05,095 --> 01:32:08,713
You weren't kidding. You really are
leaving a little more than a note.

1089
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:12,224
Well, Enid never did like to come home
to a dark house.
