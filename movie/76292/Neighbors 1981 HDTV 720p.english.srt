1
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,751
<i>Stay with us for</i>
<i>blood-chilling suspense...</i>

2
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,837
<i>... blackmail, murder,</i>
<i>intrigue and love.</i>

3
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,046
<i>Next on Channel 8.</i>

4
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,790
<i>- A tourist, visiting a friend,</i>
<i>was struck...</i>

5
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:12,421
<i>... by a 30-pound block as he</i>
<i>walked down the stage-door alley.</i>

6
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:15,303
<i>The cinder block hit me</i>
<i>on the flat side...</i>

7
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,097
<i>... of the block itself,</i>
<i>as if it were hurled at me.</i>

8
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,559
<i>- When the ferry dock ed,</i>
<i>he was napping.</i>

9
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:25,060
<i>A deck hand wok e him and told him</i>
<i>to drive off. But Max was in reverse.</i>

10
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:28,439
<i>He went right off the back of the ferry.</i>
<i>He drowned.</i>

11
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:31,947
<i>But if you were complaining</i>
<i>about the weather this week end...</i>

12
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,655
<i>... it could have been worse.</i>
<i>A series of floods...</i>

13
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:37,402
- I guess it's that time.
- You want any help?

14
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:42,540
There was a terrific recipe for capon
in the <i>Times</i> today.

15
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:46,169
Takes two minutes.

16
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,541
<i>The National Guard has been</i>
<i>called out...</i>

17
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:50,710
<i>... and some people may have to...</i>

18
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:21,747
Enid, someone's moving into
the Warren place.

19
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:22,960
So?

20
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:27,084
It's a funny time to be moving.

21
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:31,088
I don't see any kids' stuff.

22
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,927
Thank God.

23
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:42,477
Maybe we should ask them over
for a drink tonight.

24
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:45,938
- It being their first night and all.
- Tomorrow will be fine.

25
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,397
Well, tomorrow's not tonight,
you know.

26
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:51,736
- And it would be nice.
- There's plenty of time to be nice.

27
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,982
You don't have to push it.

28
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,476
I think they've got a dog.

29
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:36,154
Kalinqashe, the dog spirit,
is swift and faithful.

30
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:40,702
I don't care. I don't want him
in my garden digging up my bulbs.

31
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:44,122
Who would want your bulbs?

32
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:46,604
Hello.

33
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:51,980
- What can I do for you?
- Anything you like.

34
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:55,187
The question is,
what do you want in return?

35
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:05,033
Hi. I'm Ramona.
I just moved in next door.

36
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:08,290
- Oh, really?
- Really.

37
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,623
Who's this?

38
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:19,004
- Your girlfriend?
- No, that's my daughter, Elaine.

39
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,587
That's a hot one.

40
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,770
By the way, my name is Earl Keese.

41
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,864
I was real friendly
with a boy named Earl once.

42
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,070
Well, twice really.

43
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,127
So you're all moved in next door, huh?

44
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:55,580
It's a very good house. I imagine
you'll want to freshen it up.

45
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,832
Give it a new coat of paint,
mow the lawn.

46
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,551
Is your wife here?

47
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,421
She's in the kitchen.

48
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:05,717
- She's dying to meet you. I'll get her.
- No, no, I don't want to meet her.

49
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,429
I hope we're gonna be friends.

50
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:12,513
We were very friendly
with the Warrens next door.

51
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,891
But we weren't that close.

52
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:17,315
I mean, we were next-door close.

53
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:22,653
I didn't mean that kind of close.
I mean "close" close.

54
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,069
Is your wife making dinner?

55
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:28,320
She's fixing a great capon.

56
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,988
It was in the <i>Times</i> today.

57
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,619
Would you like to stay for dinner?

58
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,251
Are there more of you?

59
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:39,790
Is there a Mr. Ramona?

60
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,588
You go ask your wife if it's okay.

61
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,508
No, it's no problem, really.

62
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,306
Don't argue with me, Earl.

63
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:50,595
You wouldn't want me
to have to pull down your pants...

64
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:52,347
...and spank your little buns...

65
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,141
...would you?

66
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,073
Don't you go away. I'll be right back.

67
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:10,956
Okay?

68
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,257
- How many frozen waffles you want?
- Waffles? What happened to the capon?

69
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,339
- What capon?
- You said you read...

70
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:32,015
...an incredible recipe for it.
- I didn't say we were having it.

71
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,683
Leave it to you
to take something for granted.

72
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:36,812
Frozen waffles is all we've got.

73
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:39,808
Weren't you gonna pick up steaks
for tomorrow?

74
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,610
You're asking for steak?

75
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,186
You could have picked up
some cheap ones.

76
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:46,690
I will not eat cheap meat.

77
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,545
<i>No! No!</i>

78
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:09,974
- May I help you?
- Hi, Earl. I'm Vic.

79
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:13,017
I'm sure Ramona's already told you
my whole life story.

80
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:17,349
- No, but you must be her...
- That's me, like it or not.

81
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:21,141
If you know what I mean. Have a seat.

82
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:26,280
So, what do you say, neighbour?

83
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:30,149
Welcome to the end of the road,
I guess.

84
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:31,947
- It's a great house.
- Thank you.

85
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,953
I mean mine. More rooms than we
need, really, but I couldn't resist.

86
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,239
It was a steal.

87
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:39,494
What's on the menu, pal?
I'm starved.

88
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:44,420
We haven't eaten all day. We could eat
a baby's butt through a park bench.

89
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:47,795
I'm afraid I spoke too soon earlier.

90
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,971
We haven't got enough.
Enid didn't get to her shopping today.

91
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,845
Well, no sweat.
I'll just go and get some takeout.

92
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:57,184
There's nothing around here
except the standard burgers...

93
00:10:57,354 --> 00:11:00,355
...greasy dogs and a gummy pizza.
- I can do better than that.

94
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:03,146
You just leave everything
to Captain Vic.

95
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:08,529
Look, friend, if I do the running,
I know you'll wanna spring for the tab.

96
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:10,451
Okay.

97
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,750
Thirty bucks?
For four grown people?

98
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:25,835
Where have you been? It takes
30 bucks just to look at a menu.

99
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:31,387
- This is a $2 bill.
- Let me see that.

100
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,762
Gee, I thought it was a 20.

101
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:37,552
- Really.
- Well, people palm them off that way.

102
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:41,062
You never know who's gonna
stick it to you, do you, Earl?

103
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:45,312
Look, if 32 bucks isn't enough,
we can always do it some other night.

104
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:48,440
Why don't we do it now.
Let's have your car keys, okay?

105
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:51,449
- My car keys?
- Yeah, my brakes are shot.

106
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:55,152
Why don't I get the food? I'm the one
who's supposed to be neighbourly.

107
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,034
You stay here and my wife
will keep you company.

108
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:02,661
Forget it. If you insist on paying for
dinner, the least I can do is go get it.

109
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,536
What I don't understand
is where you're going.

110
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:07,588
There's no place decent around here.

111
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:11,293
If you must know, it's a new place,
opened up on the other side of town.

112
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,388
Near the train station.
Across from the warehouse.

113
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,181
Italian.

114
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:19,512
I commute, I go by there twice a day,
five days a week...

115
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:22,142
...and I've never seen
a restaurant around there.

116
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:25,481
You calling me a liar?

117
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,311
No, I...

118
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:30,310
I'm just not very observant,
I guess.

119
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,526
I can't blame you.
They don't have their sign up yet.

120
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:37,533
But it's got a cute name:
Caesar's Garlic Wars.

121
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:41,869
Okay. Why don't you
get some ravioli...

122
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,794
...and some... What do you
call those stuffed clams?

123
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:49,754
- Stuffed clams.
- Yeah. And some scampi and garlic.

124
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:52,962
Whatever I get, Earl,
I first have to get going.

125
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,011
I'll get the keys.

126
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,601
Why don't you stay here
and make yourself at home.

127
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,807
I'll be right here.

128
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:17,077
Hi.

129
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:22,455
Took a bath. There's a dead rat
in our tub over there.

130
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,040
Vic said not to move it.

131
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:29,418
Took a pill. Moving always makes me
kind of hyper.

132
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,041
I hope you don't mind.

133
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:34,799
Yeah. Sure. I don't mind.

134
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,296
Oh, you do mind, don't you?

135
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:42,014
Vic's going out for Italian food.

136
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:46,184
You come down and join us
whenever you can, okay?

137
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,688
What are you so nervous about, Earl?

138
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,739
Afraid Vic will think you're up here...

139
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,940
...chewing me?

140
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,422
What are you doing? Robbing me?

141
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:20,431
Looking for a pencil to write down
what you want for supper.

142
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,058
You got a pencil in your hand.

143
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:25,310
$327. Is that all you had
at the end of last month?

144
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:28,184
That's none of your business.
Stay out of there, please.

145
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:32,485
- I just wanted to get the order right.
- Why don't we go downstairs.

146
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:33,737
Sure.

147
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,065
After you.

148
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,279
- So, what do you want?
- Make it simple.

149
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:43,200
Spaghetti, meatballs, a salad.
Whatever you want for you and...

150
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:45,863
What's not simple
is how I get to the restaurant.

151
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,711
- Use my car.
- Has it got a key or a rubber band...

152
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:51,250
...you wind up?
- Why don't I go with you.

153
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:54,672
Afraid I'll steal your car?
That's why I moved in next door?

154
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:57,759
So I could rip off your car
and move somewhere else?

155
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,722
- There you go.
- Back in a flash, pal.

156
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,164
Waffles are browning.
Always a thrilling sight.

157
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:38,251
Good news, Enid.

158
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:41,090
Italian food is on the way.

159
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,223
You arranged it?

160
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,261
Well, more or less.
I invited the neighbours.

161
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,309
Oh, you met them.

162
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:50,438
What did you think?

163
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:08,666
Earl?

164
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,458
They're...

165
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,120
...different.

166
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:17,003
I guess I'll go up and get dressed.

167
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,009
Upstairs?

168
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:21,755
What for?

169
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:24,132
You said they were coming over.

170
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:26,880
Well, they're not dressing.
They're barely dressed.

171
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,472
I mean, you could go
in the kitchen and set the table.

172
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:35,146
And turn the waffles off.
I'll be there in a minute to help you.

173
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:38,069
You got lots to do down here.

174
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:43,027
Yeah, there is something I forgot to do.

175
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:47,674
That's a boy.
You want some steak?

176
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:58,348
Don't tell me, you must be
our new neighbour. Come on in.

177
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,555
Thanks a lot.

178
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,478
Someone's stolen our truck...

179
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:15,062
...and I need to use the phone
to call the police.

180
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:18,491
Use the phone in the kitchen.
What a terrible thing, your first day.

181
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:21,412
It's even worse than just that.
Baby was in the back.

182
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,581
- Oh, my.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

183
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,792
Vic. Your baby's drowning!

184
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:29,534
No chance.
Why should my dog be drowning?

185
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:31,465
Dog?

186
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,295
I thought "child."

187
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:37,422
We haven't any children.
Unless Ramona just pumped one out...

188
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,550
...and didn't tell me.
She calls the dog "Baby."

189
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,262
- She calls the dog "Baby"?
- Yeah. He's fine.

190
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:46,057
I just saw him around the back there.
When I drove up.

191
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,519
He's digging up something
in your flowerbed.

192
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:50,019
My flowerbed?

193
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,698
Hi, Enid.

194
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:00,661
Hi, Vic.

195
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,739
Oh, we met hours ago.

196
00:23:02,913 --> 00:23:05,451
Earl here was worried about Baby.

197
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:08,459
Oh, he's no trouble at all.
He's a perfect gentleman.

198
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:12,577
- Leave him with me any time you want.
- Don't worry, I will.

199
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:14,210
They spoil him awfully.

200
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:18,428
I want him to have every advantage
I was denied as a young dog.

201
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,169
Well, here are your keys, Mr. Keese.

202
00:23:21,515 --> 00:23:25,347
Let's dig into this stuff
before the sauce turns into penicillin.

203
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,678
Why don't you look for Ramona.

204
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:32,560
- Me?
- Finders keepers, Earl. After all...

205
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:35,404
...I know what goes on out here
in the suburbs.

206
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,028
That's why we moved here.

207
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:42,529
Oh, Vic.

208
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:50,459
- What do you think, Earl?
- Don't do that. You are outrageous.

209
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:06,757
Too bad about Vic's truck, Earl.

210
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:11,393
Well, I was just pushing it
into my garage...

211
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:14,270
...to hide it from him, you know,
kind of a joke.

212
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:17,361
- It was an accident.
- It could happen to anybody.

213
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:19,647
I think 1500 should take care of it.

214
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:22,397
Fifteen hundred? Dollars?

215
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:26,829
It was just a joke. I mean, I'm sure
your insurance will cover most of it...

216
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:30,082
...and I'll pay the deductible.
What is it, 100 or so?

217
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:34,959
For the truck.
Keeping me quiet is a little extra.

218
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:38,918
I don't believe it.

219
00:24:39,218 --> 00:24:40,593
You're blackmailing me.

220
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:43,299
Hey, what are neighbours for?

221
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,887
Oh, make it cash.

222
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,446
Hey, come on in, buddy.
Help yourself.

223
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,341
Well, here we all are.

224
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:27,093
To Vic and Ramona.

225
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:29,971
For bringing a breath of fresh air
to our neighbourhood.

226
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:33,809
May we have many, many years
of your lovely company.

227
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,855
Do they have any country fairs here?

228
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,110
Where they do things like see
which bull has the biggest balls?

229
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:54,367
This isn't really country. It's more
a suburban bedroom community.

230
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:57,663
The locals are in service trades.
They're not farmers.

231
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,789
Maybe we can measure their balls.

232
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:06,136
Or we could start with yours,
if you like.

233
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:15,885
Good, is it?

234
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:19,562
- Delicious.
- I must call Caesar's...

235
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,360
...and compliment the chef.

236
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:24,275
Tell me, were they crowded
this evening?

237
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,067
- What?
- Caesar's.

238
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:28,649
Friday night, the only place in town.

239
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:31,615
Bet they were turning them away
in droves.

240
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:33,995
Okay, you probably
called the place...

241
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,918
...and found out they're not open
for business yet, right?

242
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:38,337
Right.

243
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,121
So does that make me a liar?

244
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,457
Maybe I got there,
saw the place was closed...

245
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,840
...and went somewhere else
to pick up the food.

246
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:48,846
Where? Everything's shut at this hour.
Everything.

247
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:50,592
- And the wine?
- What's the matter?

248
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:53,802
Vic brings a wonderful dinner
and you give him the third degree.

249
00:26:53,978 --> 00:26:56,303
I don't mind.
There's no mystery about it.

250
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,979
You know Valley Field Mall on Route 3?
Across from the Cinema Cineplex?

251
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:02,730
There's a small spaghetti and wine
dealership there.

252
00:27:02,903 --> 00:27:04,481
Next to the Singer Sewing Centre.

253
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,364
That's where you got it?

254
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:08,276
That's right.

255
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,580
Well, to begin with,
Valley Field Mall is closed.

256
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:15,534
When it was open, it was
on Route 15, not Route 3.

257
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,115
And there can't be
a small spaghetti dealership...

258
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:20,998
...next to the Singer Centre
across from the cineplex...

259
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:25,632
...because there is no cineplex
and there is no Singer Sewing Centre.

260
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:30,762
All right, I can deceive you no longer.

261
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:32,966
Yes, yes, yes, I admit it.

262
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:35,099
It was me who prepared this meal...

263
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,186
...to share on our
first night together as neighbours.

264
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:42,639
This was my crime. Mixing up
a special batch of my Aunt Minota's...

265
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:45,226
...secret, sacred spaghetti sauce.

266
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:47,771
Sorry I messed up your evening. Right?

267
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:49,200
Right.

268
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,070
In light of Earl's feelings,
I think it would be best if we left.

269
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:58,832
Oh, no, no. Sit down, sit down.
Let's finish this magnificent meal.

270
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,788
Don't worry about Earl.
He'll get over his feelings.

271
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:05,048
- He spurned my sauce.
- No, he loves your sauce.

272
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,292
He's just jealous, he can't cook.

273
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,802
Earl, isn't it your turn
to do a little confessing?

274
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:15,017
- What?
- Vic's been man enough to admit...

275
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:18,553
...he was the one who cooked supper.
You've got nothing to say?

276
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:23,351
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We do have an agreement, don't we?

277
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:25,983
I'm talking about what you did outside.

278
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:32,734
Yes, Ramona. I know and I accept
the figures you mentioned.

279
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:35,736
"Figures," Earl? What "figures"?

280
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:39,613
Just a little arrangement
I have with Ramona.

281
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,040
What sort of arrangement?

282
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:46,130
Oh, boy.

283
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,789
We're waiting.
Or do I have to pound it out of you?

284
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:51,126
Don't speak to me like that
in my own house.

285
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:53,463
- Why would I?
- You just did.

286
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:57,008
- It's just a something a guy says.
- I never say it.

287
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:59,764
- I don't blame you.
- Ramona...

288
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:03,312
...why don't you be man enough
to tell us since Earl isn't.

289
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,361
He tried to pork me.

290
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,066
Pork you? What?!

291
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,109
You know you did.

292
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,573
I swear, I never touched her.

293
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:19,325
Well, I wasn't born
with your hand in my bush.

294
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,116
Enid, help me.

295
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,080
Tell them I couldn't
do something like that.

296
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:29,211
- Let's leave that to the police.
- Vic, she's not my type.

297
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:35,550
Enid, you tell Earl he'll have
a chance to defend himself.

298
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:40,632
I think you can see
why we have to leave.

299
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:43,807
I know you meant well.
Didn't you?

300
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,687
We might have had
a wonderful relationship.

301
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,480
But then, as Arthur Bremer once said:

302
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:53,607
"How many things go right
in this crazy world?"

303
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,483
Ramona, let's go.

304
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:00,287
Come on, before he gets dangerous.

305
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,994
- I thought I'd be able to defend myself!
- Not so loud, Earl.

306
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,787
Afraid we'll disturb the neighbours?
These are the goddamn neighbours!

307
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:11,586
Calm yourself, Earl.
I'm not gonna take you to court.

308
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,843
That would make for bad blood.
We don't want any bad blood...

309
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:19,508
...especially since we'll be living
next door to you for a long, long time.

310
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:26,477
I swear to God, Enid,
we may have to move.

311
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,392
They're very strange people.

312
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:31,237
You know how after five minutes
when you meet someone...

313
00:30:31,403 --> 00:30:33,063
...you know everything about them?

314
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:35,990
What they do, their last name.
We know nothing about them.

315
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:39,408
- So what?
- So why didn't you say something?

316
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:42,152
You were in the house the whole time
she was here.

317
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:45,000
Besides, you know how long it takes
to pork someone?

318
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,492
No, how long does it take, Earl?

319
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:49,995
Are you saying you believe her?

320
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:52,959
Enid, I'm the same man
you've known for 16 years.

321
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,760
I know.

322
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,509
What the hell's going on around here?

323
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,135
He comes waltzing in
and you say, "Hi, Vic."

324
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:03,926
- How did you know his name?
- He came over this afternoon.

325
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:06,221
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

326
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:10,062
- You could've told me in the car.
- You know we never talk in the car.

327
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,191
Today you could've made an exception.

328
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:15,944
That house next door is empty
for six months and you meet...

329
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:19,365
...the new occupants before I do,
and you don't say anything?

330
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:22,619
- Enid, am I being unreasonable?
- Pass the wine.

331
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,287
Did you tell me everybody
you met today?

332
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:28,328
I didn't meet anyone today.
I never meet anyone.

333
00:31:28,502 --> 00:31:31,040
A new neighbour's
a bit different, isn't it?

334
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:33,585
A new neighbour whose unit
we can stare at.

335
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:37,091
- I wasn't staring at his unit.
- I saw you, Enid.

336
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:40,630
I don't care what other wives do,
only the one I'm married to.

337
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:43,178
I know when a woman's
checking out a man's unit.

338
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,719
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, Vic's wife, that Ramona.

339
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,813
She did it to me, practically
unzipped my fly with her eyes.

340
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:51,441
And you hated it, right?

341
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,645
How many stiff nips
did you check out at the office today?

342
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,521
I know you, Earl, your eyes
never sit still for a minute.

343
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,942
Why'd you give their dog our steak?

344
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,360
I saw you, behind my back.

345
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:06,491
I was afraid you wouldn't approve.

346
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:09,619
You were afraid right,
I can tell you that.

347
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:12,294
What could I do?

348
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,705
Vic asked me
to look after Baby for a while.

349
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:18,630
But steak? Jesus, why didn't you
stuff money into his mouth?

350
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:20,842
And 32 bucks for this load of crap?

351
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,136
It's his money.

352
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:26,472
Baby! Oh, my God! Baby!

353
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,850
Get that thing away from that thing!

354
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:37,976
What happened?

355
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:41,156
Baby was over by that thing
taking a leak.

356
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,366
Jesus Christ.

357
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:50,120
Come, Baby. Come.

358
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,837
Come here. Come here.

359
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:03,761
He's all right.

360
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,103
Sweetie, where's the truck?

361
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,851
Maybe that thing got our truck
like Earl got me.

362
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,115
Relax with that stuff. Our boy here
has been through enough.

363
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:27,198
We really had you going there.
Ramona's such an imp.

364
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:31,451
We were just kind of putting you on
at supper. Like a little joke.

365
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:35,575
A joke? You call accusing me
of porking Ramona a joke?

366
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:39,170
Oh, what's the matter with you, Earl?
Can't you take a joke?

367
00:33:39,341 --> 00:33:43,635
Let's go, Ramona, come in the house.
It's Friday night. I'll buy you a drink.

368
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:47,593
Yeah, I can take a joke, Enid!

369
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,346
- Can you take a joke, Vic?
- Any joke you dish up.

370
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,895
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, try me.

371
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,605
- I sank your truck.
- What?

372
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:57,521
I didn't mean to. I lost control after
I moved the brick from under your tire.

373
00:33:57,693 --> 00:34:00,362
You touched my brick?
I told you I had no brakes.

374
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:02,688
I borrowed your car for the takeout.

375
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:06,649
- But you didn't go for takeout.
- Where's my truck and my airplane?

376
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:09,990
It's down in the swamp.
I'll go get my jacket.

377
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:13,664
We'll get your jacket later.
You just take me to...

378
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,245
...the swamp.

379
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:30,554
Give me the light, I'll lead the way.

380
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:33,395
You're pretty lucky,
having a swamp next to your house.

381
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:35,140
It didn't always smell this way.

382
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:38,648
When we moved in, it was a freshwater
lake with fish and everything.

383
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:41,771
Then the Interstate Chemical
began dumping upstream...

384
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,437
...and weird things started to grow.

385
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:48,528
I haven't been here since the search
party a couple years ago.

386
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,161
Search party?

387
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:51,372
Yeah.

388
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,209
Some guy disappeared down here.

389
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,001
A lineman from the power company.
Said it was quicksand.

390
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:02,042
Quicksand, this part of the country?
No way.

391
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:03,710
That's what I said.

392
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:05,427
Vic!

393
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,846
Vic!

394
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,551
Vic, help me. Please help me!

395
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,850
Do you feel my truck in there?

396
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,593
Vic, come on, help me.
I'll buy you a new truck.

397
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:20,817
Not like that one. How about my
triplane? How you gonna replace that?

398
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:24,444
Help, please.
I'm being sucked down.

399
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,609
- Maybe it's best that way.
- What are you talking about?

400
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,316
You're not the ideal neighbour.
You sank my truck...

401
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:33,068
...you insulted my sauce
and you violated Ramona.

402
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:36,622
- You said it was just a joke.
- But she was in your bathtub.

403
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,749
No, she wasn't.
She was in the bed.

404
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:41,748
And that is where
you saw her mammae.

405
00:35:41,964 --> 00:35:44,881
- Her mammal?
- Her honkers, Earl.

406
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:46,420
She dropped the towel.

407
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:49,713
Did she drop it,
or did you psychically will it to fall?

408
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:53,340
- "Will it to fall"?
- Did you will her towel to fall?

409
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,602
No.

410
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,053
Never. No.

411
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,559
Admit it, Earl.
They'll go easier on you if you do.

412
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:04,398
Will it to fall?
Well... No, I don't think so.

413
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:06,022
Come on, Earl.

414
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:09,817
- Well, maybe a little.
- Come on.

415
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:11,570
Yes! Yes!

416
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,111
- Okay, I admit it.
- Admit what?

417
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,579
Yes. I willed the towel to fall!

418
00:36:23,797 --> 00:36:27,416
Grab on. Earl Keese, come on up.

419
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:31,217
See, all I wanted was a little honesty
in our relationship, buddy.

420
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:33,547
You'd want the
same thing, right, pal?

421
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,483
Vic.

422
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,027
Vic.

423
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,779
Don't kid around.

424
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:52,235
Come on up. Vic!

425
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:04,245
Vic, I'm sorry.
Vic, come back, Vic!

426
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:05,792
Vic, come back.

427
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:14,639
Forgive me, Vic.

428
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,145
Forgive me.

429
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:16,277
Oh, my God.

430
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,121
I must be seeing things.

431
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,914
So there was this Indian and...

432
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,379
Oh, God!

433
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,968
Jesus! Get out of here!
Get out!

434
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:21,471
Get out of my house!

435
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:25,554
You're certifiable!
You and that woman!

436
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:29,265
You're nuts!
You're a maniac! Get out!

437
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:57,791
God, does it always
shrivel up when you shower?

438
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:02,558
Great.

439
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,805
Now it's your turn
to annoy me, right?

440
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,267
I was looking for Baby. You haven't
seen him, have you? He kills chickens.

441
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:13,942
Well, I don't keep
chickens in the shower.

442
00:40:21,827 --> 00:40:25,695
- This is pretty.
- Please don't touch them.

443
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:27,873
Put them back on the shelf.

444
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,503
Snippy.

445
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:42,298
Your left ball
in the corner pocket.

446
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:52,775
Sorry, Earl.

447
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:56,937
I started collecting them
when I was 9 years old.

448
00:40:57,404 --> 00:41:00,322
Hey, you kids,
keep it down to a dull roar.

449
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,816
I'm not cleaning up
down there again, Earl.

450
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:05,863
What's happening, gang?

451
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,208
Hi, Vic.
Come on in and join the party.

452
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:12,665
I gotta go upstairs, be right back.

453
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:15,672
I gotta get a broom
to sweep up all this junk.

454
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,583
Get a little rough with you, did he?

455
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:18,801
Hey!

456
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:24,097
Earl. Hey, Earl.

457
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:27,598
- Go to hell. You're not getting back in.
- You locked them in?

458
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:30,852
They're a couple of cases.
They're fruitcakes, lunatics.

459
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:35,185
- Both of them. They're hazardous, Enid.
- Enid. You in there, honey?

460
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,068
Right here, Captain Vic.
You can't keep them prisoners, Earl.

461
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,237
I'm gonna call the locksmith.
They can let them out the side door.

462
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:45,780
Hello, Chic. It's Earl.

463
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:48,409
- Earl. Earl who?
- <i>No jokes, will you?</i>

464
00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:50,407
<i>I need the name of that locksmith.</i>

465
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,868
I broke a key and I got
two lunatics locked in my basement.

466
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:57,206
What? What did you say?

467
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:59,914
- Blow it out your ass.
- Is somebody on this line?

468
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:03,254
- Just you and me, asshole.
- The bastard's on the phone.

469
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,303
- <i>You called me, didn't you?</i>
- <i>Not you.</i>

470
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:06,967
- Me.
- Get off the line, Vic.

471
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:08,635
- Who's Vic?
- <i>He lives next door.</i>

472
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:10,885
- Nobody lives next door.
- <i>That's right.</i>

473
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:12,930
- Christ.
- <i>Earl, you been drinking?</i>

474
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:15,892
- What the hell is going on?
- Never mind, forget it.

475
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:18,231
And don't ever call here again.

476
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,820
Oh, really, Earl. Grow up.

477
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:27,818
- Vic, stop!
- Please, you promised me. Please.

478
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:31,329
- Your leg. Just one leg.
- It's a trick.

479
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:33,990
You are pitiful, Earl.
How do you know it's a trick?

480
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:38,296
- You always go limp in a crisis.
- It's not a crisis, it's a trick.

481
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:42,544
How do you know Vic
isn't an escaped vivisectionist?

482
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:44,587
A vivisectionist!

483
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:51,268
Ramona!

484
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:55,350
Are you still in one piece?

485
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:14,073
Come on, kids.

486
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,577
Fun's fun.

487
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,966
All right. Game's over.

488
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,686
Enid!

489
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:35,938
Enid!

490
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:09,255
Greavy's Garage.

491
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:11,678
I'm sorry to be calling you
at this hour.

492
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:16,102
It don't matter. We're open 24 hours.
All day, all damn night. What you need?

493
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,681
<i>I'm at number 2 Burt Street.</i>

494
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:22,144
I need somebody to let me out of my
basement, and a tow truck immediately.

495
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,186
Ain't that damn truck there yet?

496
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,031
I sent my boy Perry out there
five minutes ago.

497
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:29,528
<i>Some fella named Vic called up.</i>

498
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,195
You're kidding.

499
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,368
Yeah, I'm kidding. I stay up all night
so I can wank my crank on the phone.

500
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,626
Wait a minute.

501
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:54,797
- He just got here.
- <i>That fella Vic...</i>

502
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:57,264
<i>... says you run his truck</i>
<i>down the swamp.</i>

503
00:44:57,436 --> 00:44:59,476
Locked him and
his missus in a root cellar.

504
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:02,102
- It was kind of a joke.
- A joke?

505
00:45:02,274 --> 00:45:06,023
What the hell kind of joke is that?
It's as funny as a gutful of pinworms.

506
00:45:06,195 --> 00:45:09,231
- <i>Who asked your opinion?</i>
- Who the hell has to, jack-off?

507
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:11,939
Just because I lay under
your carpet that's insides...

508
00:45:12,117 --> 00:45:14,869
...and because I snake your pipes
and drain your cesspool...

509
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:18,620
...don't make me dirt under your feet.
I'm as good as you any day, asshole.

510
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:23,126
If I didn't have to do this crap for a
living, I wouldn't sell you my snot.

511
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:39,395
Enid.

512
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:05,583
It's like a peashooter. I saw a guy
take three slugs from one of these.

513
00:46:05,754 --> 00:46:07,961
- He just kept coming.
- I remember that.

514
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,290
- Be cool, brothers.
- Take it easy, guys.

515
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,219
- You too. Good night.
- Look who's home.

516
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:16,388
- Our daughter, the outlaw hitchhiker.
- Hi, Daddy.

517
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:20,471
- Elaine, what are you doing home?
- Got kicked out of school. I'm hungry.

518
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:24,938
We're gonna party with the neighbours.
Aren't they neat? I got some vodka.

519
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,940
- She got kicked out.
- Leave her alone.

520
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:29,102
Vic, what did you say
is in a pile driver?

521
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:32,896
Italian Galliano for passion,
Irish Mist for love and...

522
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:36,324
...Russian vodka for endurance.
- Poor baby. Learn to relax.

523
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:38,778
Too much excitement's
no good for you.

524
00:46:38,954 --> 00:46:43,332
Why don't you go upstairs,
take a hot bath, get into bed...

525
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,035
...and I'll come up to tuck
you in and help you go to sleep.

526
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:48,914
That's a good idea.

527
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,708
- I'll go in and say good night.
- That's a good boy.

528
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,753
We used to put
20 of them in there.

529
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,298
Activate the speed rollers, turn on
the hose circuits and that's it.

530
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,804
Vic Zeck's liquid lunch!

531
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,061
Good night, everybody.

532
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,346
I'm going to bed.

533
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:09,851
I bet you never seen
a pair of these before.

534
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,938
Take a sniff.

535
00:47:17,076 --> 00:47:19,364
- It smells like a peach.
- What are those?

536
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,529
They're my panties. They're edible.

537
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:25,833
Edible. Hey, wow. The wonders of
modern petro technology.

538
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:29,370
- Where'd you get them?
- At school. All the kids have them.

539
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:32,247
- They're tasty.
- They come in four flavours.

540
00:47:32,424 --> 00:47:34,998
- What a great idea.
- Yeah. Four flavours.

541
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:38,546
Earl, want some of your daughter's
panties? They come in four flavours.

542
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:42,257
Banana, peach, mint,
and, of course, cherry.

543
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,058
Good night, ladies.

544
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:57,605
You should have gone
up to bed like I said.

545
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,655
Nice meeting you.
Good night, Enid.

546
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:12,582
- Nice, Earl. Good move.
- Guys, it's 2 in the morning.

547
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,832
Come on, you need some sleep.

548
00:48:16,343 --> 00:48:18,301
Turn off the lights, Earl.

549
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:20,639
Two? 2:00?

550
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:24,308
Is that right? Can that be right?

551
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,467
What do you want?

552
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:06,809
Please let me in, Earl.
I'll give you a kiss. Anyplace you like.

553
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:09,313
Oh, Christ.

554
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:15,566
You've got no interest in me.
Why are you coming on to me?

555
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:19,478
We could have a real good time, Earl.
I don't care about your false teeth.

556
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:24,159
- I haven't got false teeth.
- I'm sorry. I guess they just look false.

557
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,324
Look, what do you want from me?

558
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:32,705
Not just now, the whole thing.
You and Vic. Why?

559
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,083
Poor baby. I guess no one ever
tried to make friends with you before.

560
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:38,342
Here.

561
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,753
Earl, if you won't
let me come in and play...

562
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:46,137
...you come out and play with me.
- Earl.

563
00:49:46,308 --> 00:49:47,803
- Just for a little while.
- Earl.

564
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,640
- We can talk.
- Earl, are you down there?

565
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,314
Coming.

566
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:56,724
Wait. Stay here. I'll be right back.

567
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,529
Who were you
talking to down there?

568
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:10,830
Talking to? Nobody.

569
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:13,377
Well.

570
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:17,586
I'm gonna take a shower.

571
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,041
Whatever you say, Earl.

572
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,000
Ramona.

573
00:51:42,675 --> 00:51:44,134
Ramona.

574
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:51,676
- Well, that was a huge waste of time.
- What do you want?

575
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,563
I give your car a good going-over,
a real good going-over.

576
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,894
And there's nothing wrong with it.
Not a damn thing. So I brung it back.

577
00:52:01,443 --> 00:52:03,769
I guess you had a
good laugh on me, huh?

578
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:06,437
- Pardon?
- Making a horse's patoot out of me.

579
00:52:06,615 --> 00:52:09,320
- Yeah, huh?
- Wait. I didn't ask to have my...

580
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,945
...car hauled away. Someone
played a joke on both of us.

581
00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:14,949
You're just full of jokes, aren't you?

582
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:18,290
Well, I think you're a dirty
shit sack, how about that?

583
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:48,199
Ramona.

584
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,624
Who goes there?

585
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:09,004
Hi. It's Earl Keese.

586
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,681
Oh, God!

587
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:19,605
Oh, God.

588
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:33,201
My God, I thought you were a prowler.
You all right?

589
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:35,492
- I guess so.
- You look bad, Earl.

590
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:37,199
You sure you didn't get hit?

591
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:39,780
I don't know.
I've never been shot at before.

592
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:42,414
What were you doing out here?
What was that noise?

593
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,504
- What are you up to now?
- Nothing.

594
00:53:46,715 --> 00:53:48,957
Bet you're looking
for Ramona, aren't you?

595
00:53:49,176 --> 00:53:53,340
- No.
- You're rooting around for Ramona.

596
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:58,471
I'm not rooting around.
She wanted to talk.

597
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:01,182
She wanted to talk?

598
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:05,015
Well, actually,
I wanted to talk to someone.

599
00:54:05,234 --> 00:54:06,609
You wanna talk to me?

600
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:08,988
Sure.

601
00:54:17,162 --> 00:54:19,488
Come on. Inside.

602
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:41,143
Grab a seat,
I'll fix us some coffee.

603
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:05,493
I feel terrible about your eye.

604
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:08,415
Couldn't be helped.

605
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:15,882
What are you doing
with all that stuff on?

606
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:20,141
I was gonna take a dive in the swamp,
try to locate my truck and airplane.

607
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:32,273
I remember Mrs. Warren used
to bake bread in this kitchen.

608
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:35,981
I could smell the bread
all the way over at my house.

609
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:52,920
- Instant okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:12,645
Better get that fixed.

611
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:19,869
- Strong?
- Well, not too.

612
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:38,302
- I gotta rinse this out.
- And waste that coffee?

613
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:43,259
I'll just put it someplace
until I wash out the cup.

614
00:56:53,652 --> 00:56:55,194
Sit down, Earl.

615
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:57,818
- I just want to...
- Sit down.

616
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:10,288
Now, just put the coffee powder
back in the cup.

617
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:22,587
- Can I wash my hand?
- No.

618
00:57:22,765 --> 00:57:25,516
I thought you came over here to talk.

619
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:36,569
I like mine tepid and black.
How about you?

620
00:57:36,779 --> 00:57:37,821
Same.

621
00:57:51,919 --> 00:57:56,047
Now you take back that cup you keep
switching, Earl. Or it'll be pump city.

622
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:01,249
Well, it makes no difference to me.

623
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:16,360
So.

624
00:58:17,278 --> 00:58:19,104
Here we are.

625
00:58:21,907 --> 00:58:24,944
It's about your daughter,
Elaine, isn't it?

626
00:58:25,828 --> 00:58:27,619
I thought so.

627
00:58:28,497 --> 00:58:30,822
I'd say you got a
real problem there, Earl.

628
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,158
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

629
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,292
Drugs. I can tell.

630
00:58:35,754 --> 00:58:37,712
That spaced-out look.

631
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:40,882
Used to see it in dust cases
the state police brought in...

632
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:43,887
...when I was night custody chief
at Oakville Mental.

633
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:48,099
Yeah, she's got the dries. She
always keeps licking her lips.

634
00:58:48,267 --> 00:58:51,850
- She was dying for a fix.
- She has never taken drugs in her life.

635
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:56,517
- Never!
- Well, it was just a wild guess.

636
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:05,947
They think she stole a ring at school.
I just can't believe it.

637
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,248
Is that all? I thought there was
some kind of major catastrophe.

638
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:15,370
She's been expelled, for God's sake.

639
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:18,462
I can think of a problem
that's more important...

640
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:20,956
...and you, as a parent,
are ignoring it.

641
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,176
What?

642
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:27,044
What is Elaine doing about sex?
Is she getting probed?

643
00:59:27,223 --> 00:59:30,389
That was very foolish, Earl.
And it could get you snuffed!

644
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:40,353
Why do I keep getting sucked
into these degrading conversations?

645
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:45,689
Why should I assume that suddenly
you'll turn into a human being?

646
00:59:45,908 --> 00:59:48,316
Both you or Ramona.

647
01:00:45,176 --> 01:00:46,218
Enid?

648
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:53,592
- Yes, Earl?
- Why is this door locked?

649
01:00:59,982 --> 01:01:04,443
Is that the dog?
Enid, is that goddamn dog in there?

650
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:08,989
It's all right.
He's housebroken. Almost.

651
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:14,613
What the hell is going on in there?

652
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:37,350
Enid?
Do you realise how this looks?

653
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,766
Should have slipped it through the mail
slot while you had the chance, Earl.

654
01:01:41,982 --> 01:01:46,691
This is going to take explaining, Enid.
A helluva lot of explaining.

655
01:01:48,113 --> 01:01:51,482
- Daddy, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

656
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:54,494
- I was talking to your mother.
- Through the door?

657
01:01:54,662 --> 01:01:58,611
- It wasn't very important. Go to sleep.
- I just got up.

658
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,542
Okay, then do that, then.

659
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:16,764
How about this?
Beautiful morning, huh?

660
01:02:17,017 --> 01:02:19,591
Somebody really did
a number on your front end here.

661
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,435
Not to worry. I know a gypsy
in the city does cheap bodywork.

662
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:27,392
Somebody wrote something here too.
Said "pimp wagon."

663
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,064
You know who wrote that.

664
01:02:29,238 --> 01:02:31,480
Why would I let
anybody write on your car?

665
01:02:31,657 --> 01:02:34,326
I gotta use this buggy today,
to get us breakfast.

666
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:36,320
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

667
01:02:36,495 --> 01:02:40,540
- Just you and me?
- Yeah. Right. Who needs the women?

668
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:45,535
You know, personally, I think if it'd
just been us guys last night...

669
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:48,376
...we wouldn't have had any trouble.
- Really?

670
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:51,087
I know women,
upside down and backwards...

671
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,751
...which is not a bad way
to know them, huh?

672
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:57,630
I guess so. Say, what does
that say on your arm?

673
01:03:00,102 --> 01:03:05,772
- "Born to party."
- It's the way I live, babe. Have a cigar.

674
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,938
You ever seen one of these?

675
01:03:14,325 --> 01:03:15,367
Wow.

676
01:03:16,535 --> 01:03:18,444
You know what you and I need?

677
01:03:18,704 --> 01:03:21,409
- A boys' night out.
- Yeah.

678
01:03:21,624 --> 01:03:24,494
- You fool around?
- Yeah, sure.

679
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:28,079
Good. Keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna get us breakfast.

680
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,877
I hope you like
blueberry pancakes and sausage.

681
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,089
- That's what you're getting.
- Sounds great.

682
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,217
Not the way I fix them.

683
01:04:08,754 --> 01:04:10,663
Get your foot off the gas!

684
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:14,125
Well, watch the lever. Put your...!

685
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:17,053
Stop. Pull up, you jerk.
Back up.

686
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:18,596
What...?

687
01:04:18,764 --> 01:04:23,971
Stop it. Watch where you're going.
Stop. Would you stop? You stupid shit!

688
01:04:24,144 --> 01:04:26,386
I ought to crush
your head with a mallet.

689
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:30,685
The kid's an animal.
You got the keys?

690
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,647
It's not my truck.
The owner went to get breakfast.

691
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,648
I hear you got a whore in there.

692
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,317
- Who told you that?
- I heard.

693
01:04:37,491 --> 01:04:39,484
- Well you heard wrong.
- Ain't got a whore?

694
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,154
- No.
- Know where to find one?

695
01:04:41,328 --> 01:04:44,448
- Of course not.
- If one shows up, you let me know?

696
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:53,751
Careful. That mother freaking
snap back between...

697
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:56,925
...your legs and lash your
whacker off something fierce.

698
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:04,935
Well.

699
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:11,014
It doesn't look too bad, does it?
I don't think we'll have to tow it away.

700
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:14,191
Am I right?

701
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:18,698
You the bastard that mouthed off
to my dad last night?

702
01:05:19,366 --> 01:05:21,940
He smashed my car and
he punched me in the stomach.

703
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,863
Oh, yeah?

704
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:28,122
How would you like your
nuts nailed to your forehead, huh?

705
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,957
Hey. Leave that wart-head alone.
Come on, we got cesspools to suck.

706
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:33,831
Okay, Dad.

707
01:05:35,382 --> 01:05:37,126
You're lucky.

708
01:05:37,343 --> 01:05:42,717
I gotta go help my dad now.
But I'll be back.

709
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:13,160
Hey, Vic. They got your truck.

710
01:06:13,796 --> 01:06:17,544
Looks as good as new.
Not a scratch on it.

711
01:06:17,758 --> 01:06:19,715
Well, where's breakfast?

712
01:06:20,302 --> 01:06:22,010
Not a scratch?

713
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:29,508
The rear axle's broken.

714
01:06:29,812 --> 01:06:32,184
Well, I'll get it fixed. It's only fair.

715
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:37,101
- Forget it. Give it a decent burial.
- You don't want your truck?

716
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:39,069
You don't get it, do you?

717
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,110
I'm moving. Away.

718
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:52,198
Moving? What do you mean, moving?
You haven't been here 24 hours yet.

719
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:54,285
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. That swamp.

720
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:57,035
In the summer, it must be
a swing club for mosquitoes.

721
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:58,958
The county sprays.
It's no problem.

722
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:01,540
Those lines,
they're too close to the house.

723
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:04,007
They cause hair loss,
lumbar ecstimiosis...

724
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,053
...post cortical lesions and impotency.

725
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:07,552
It's just a myth.

726
01:07:07,725 --> 01:07:11,094
The power company wouldn't
put them up if they were dangerous.

727
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:16,352
Of course, it's your right to move,
I guess.

728
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:19,692
But as far as I'm concerned,
I'd honestly like you to stay.

729
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:21,356
You would?

730
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:24,857
Well, to tell you the truth...

731
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:27,566
...I haven't got
any friends around here.

732
01:07:28,704 --> 01:07:32,868
I mean it.
As crazy as last night was...

733
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:36,001
...even though I hated your guts
through most of it...

734
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:37,712
...I really had...

735
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,422
...a good time.

736
01:07:41,008 --> 01:07:42,419
Good time.

737
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:47,587
I can't remember a better time
on any Friday night I've ever had.

738
01:07:47,806 --> 01:07:49,217
Neither can I.

739
01:07:49,391 --> 01:07:51,384
I bet Ramona doesn't wanna move,
does she?

740
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,431
She's not moving.
You can have her. She's all paid for.

741
01:07:55,523 --> 01:07:58,856
This is another joke.
Of course you're gonna take your wife.

742
01:07:59,026 --> 01:08:00,769
She might come in handy.

743
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:04,610
- Who says she's my wife?
- She's not your wife?

744
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:07,024
- Whose wife is she?
- I couldn't care less.

745
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:09,870
If you want her, she's yours.
With my compliments.

746
01:08:10,037 --> 01:08:12,742
Well, I gotta pack.
It's been nice knowing you.

747
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:17,953
Enid. Open this door.

748
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,878
It's open.

749
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:25,635
Where's Enid?

750
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:30,714
What the hell's going on in here?
Why was that door locked before?

751
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:32,302
Where's my wife?

752
01:08:32,518 --> 01:08:33,977
She's your wife.

753
01:08:34,186 --> 01:08:36,973
Oh, yeah? Well, you know
what Vic just told me?

754
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:38,642
- What?
- He's moving.

755
01:08:38,816 --> 01:08:40,773
Moving away.
And leaving you here.

756
01:08:40,943 --> 01:08:43,814
He said I could have you.
What do you think about that?

757
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:47,067
- Sounds exciting.
- I'm serious.

758
01:08:47,283 --> 01:08:48,951
So am I.

759
01:08:52,037 --> 01:08:54,113
For God's sake,
Ramona, cover yourself.

760
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,867
Come on.

761
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:59,874
- People just don't do this kind of thing.
- But we could.

762
01:09:01,797 --> 01:09:03,624
Don't worry about Enid.

763
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:08,176
She's not around.
We won't be disturbed.

764
01:09:09,889 --> 01:09:12,510
Come on, before it gets cold.

765
01:09:12,683 --> 01:09:14,011
I can't.

766
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:16,426
I know. You're worried about Vic.

767
01:09:16,937 --> 01:09:19,226
No, I'm not worried about Vic.

768
01:09:19,398 --> 01:09:21,604
- He's next door packing.
- All right, baby.

769
01:09:21,817 --> 01:09:24,569
- Baby, watch it. All right, sweetheart.
- Oh, boy.

770
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:28,772
One time.
All right. All right, sweetie.

771
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:33,533
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

772
01:09:33,746 --> 01:09:37,079
All right. Looking good.

773
01:09:38,584 --> 01:09:42,961
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

774
01:09:43,172 --> 01:09:45,046
Jesus, what a case.

775
01:09:45,216 --> 01:09:47,374
Two minutes ago, he said
he was moving away.

776
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:49,129
I think Vic was right about you.

777
01:09:49,762 --> 01:09:51,090
About what?

778
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:56,049
He said up is definitely not
your direction.

779
01:09:57,311 --> 01:09:59,719
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

780
01:09:59,897 --> 01:10:02,566
Okay, we'll just see about that.

781
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:05,480
That's my little sweetheart. All right.

782
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:12,697
All right, dive, baby, dive.
Let's see a screaming dive. All right.

783
01:10:12,868 --> 01:10:15,538
- Hi, neighbour.
- Hi.

784
01:10:15,704 --> 01:10:20,662
Now, I'm just gonna go under
the covers and take a little inventory.

785
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:25,829
- Promise you won't go away.
- I promise.

786
01:10:26,006 --> 01:10:30,549
What beautiful performance. Beautiful.
Watch that mixture, watch that mixture.

787
01:10:30,761 --> 01:10:33,003
All right, all right.

788
01:10:34,098 --> 01:10:37,716
All right, that's my sweetie.
Good, climb, baby, climb.

789
01:10:37,893 --> 01:10:39,601
Come on, Earl.

790
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:42,522
I can't concentrate. It's Vic's plane.

791
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:47,316
That's it. Watch it.
Watch that mixture, take it easy.

792
01:10:51,282 --> 01:10:54,401
Good. He stopped.

793
01:10:59,748 --> 01:11:02,500
Earl. Earl, come quick!

794
01:11:04,169 --> 01:11:07,918
Where are you, are you
upstairs? Earl?

795
01:11:09,175 --> 01:11:12,875
- Vic, what happened?
- We're losing the house, babe.

796
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:19,635
Vic's house is on fire.

797
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,388
Did you call the fire department?

798
01:11:21,562 --> 01:11:25,180
My phone's dead.
Your phone's dead too.

799
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:30,607
Water, water.

800
01:11:30,821 --> 01:11:35,567
Look. Look, there's no fire.
It's a trick.

801
01:11:37,786 --> 01:11:39,115
Oh, it was terrible.

802
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,536
I had her up to 100 feet.
Everything was great.

803
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:43,035
Then the controls jammed.

804
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:45,620
I think it was that tower.

805
01:11:45,794 --> 01:11:49,045
- My signal couldn't get to the servos.
- Poor baby.

806
01:11:49,256 --> 01:11:51,415
The motor cut out.
I knew it was in the soup.

807
01:11:51,592 --> 01:11:54,961
She went into a vertical spin,
hit the power lines, bounced up.

808
01:11:55,137 --> 01:11:57,379
And then she climbed 300 feet.

809
01:11:57,973 --> 01:12:01,342
You should've seen her.
She was magnificent.

810
01:12:01,519 --> 01:12:05,018
She just sort of stopped
and hung there.

811
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:07,894
Then she nosed over and came
straight down into my attic.

812
01:12:08,067 --> 01:12:11,602
- The fuel pods exploded in seconds.
- Jesus.

813
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:14,567
I stamped on the flames,
and everything spread so fast.

814
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,400
That old house is like a matchbox.

815
01:12:16,575 --> 01:12:19,944
If you hadn't had the keys to the car,
he could have driven to a phone.

816
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,703
- What about his truck?
- You broke his rear axle, Daddy.

817
01:12:31,465 --> 01:12:33,374
All right, here, then. It works.

818
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,958
Go ahead. Call the fire department.

819
01:12:36,136 --> 01:12:39,054
You see, he won't even use
the phone.

820
01:12:39,223 --> 01:12:41,548
This is just another one of
his cheap tricks.

821
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:44,726
Isn't that right, Vic?

822
01:12:44,895 --> 01:12:46,389
Look at him, Enid.

823
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:51,272
You're fawning all over a fake,
a phoney and a fraud.

824
01:12:59,243 --> 01:13:02,576
- Hey, brother, how about a beer?
- No, thank you.

825
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,832
Look at that thing go.

826
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,128
- What's wrong with the water?
- No pressure. Can't you see?

827
01:13:10,296 --> 01:13:13,712
- Well, what can we do about it?
- I know what we can do.

828
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:15,881
- What?
- Get some marshmallows.

829
01:13:31,066 --> 01:13:33,777
Enid. Elaine.

830
01:13:35,446 --> 01:13:38,566
Relax. They're all gone.
They left in your car.

831
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:40,574
Elaine had a key.

832
01:13:40,743 --> 01:13:42,700
Vic made a trade.

833
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,862
All of them for me.

834
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:51,662
It's been less than 24 hours since
you and Vic moved in next door.

835
01:13:54,215 --> 01:13:57,465
- It seems like years.
- A lot has happened.

836
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:00,920
You gonna miss Vic?

837
01:14:01,096 --> 01:14:02,139
Vic?

838
01:14:03,349 --> 01:14:05,140
I don't know.

839
01:14:05,684 --> 01:14:07,973
He was fantastic in bed.

840
01:14:08,145 --> 01:14:09,937
Until I got in it.

841
01:14:11,941 --> 01:14:14,692
You know, it's really great
that you can...

842
01:14:15,277 --> 01:14:19,357
...admit things like that
in your relationship.

843
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,942
You're really wonderful.

844
01:14:25,204 --> 01:14:28,039
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

845
01:14:32,086 --> 01:14:35,918
Is it so hard having your fantasies
come to life?

846
01:14:38,259 --> 01:14:42,422
There's not a single living thing
left on this road...

847
01:14:42,596 --> 01:14:44,921
...except you and me.

848
01:14:45,474 --> 01:14:49,768
You know what we're gonna do now,
Earl, just you and me?

849
01:14:51,605 --> 01:14:52,648
What?

850
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:56,393
Have breakfast. Are you hungry?

851
01:14:57,194 --> 01:15:01,274
I'm starving, but there's no food
in the house.

852
01:15:01,448 --> 01:15:03,441
Well, if you have ketchup
and hot water...

853
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:05,361
...I could make you tomato soup.

854
01:15:05,995 --> 01:15:07,037
Hey.

855
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,913
I got a better idea. We'll go to the city.
We'll go anyplace you like.

856
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:13,325
What kind of food?
French, Spanish, fish?

857
01:15:14,253 --> 01:15:15,747
- I like Greek.
- Greek. Great.

858
01:15:15,921 --> 01:15:17,748
I know a great Greek restaurant.

859
01:15:17,923 --> 01:15:20,165
- I'll go get a cab. I'll get ready...
- Oh, Earl?

860
01:15:20,551 --> 01:15:21,594
Yeah?

861
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:26,961
I know just who I want for dessert.

862
01:16:51,225 --> 01:16:52,685
Ramona.

863
01:16:53,769 --> 01:16:55,229
Ramona?

864
01:17:01,819 --> 01:17:03,279
Ramona?

865
01:17:12,955 --> 01:17:14,415
Ramona.

866
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:18,452
Surprise!

867
01:17:18,627 --> 01:17:20,205
See, buddy, I got you breakfast.

868
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:22,870
Hey, Daddy, Vic brought
my five favourite junkfoods.

869
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:26,382
Elaine, get out the china. We'll inhale
this poison on the good stuff.

870
01:17:26,552 --> 01:17:30,300
- Where's all that plum sauce?
- It's in here, it's in here. Wait a second.

871
01:18:02,546 --> 01:18:04,918
Would you like some wine, Enid?

872
01:18:09,887 --> 01:18:12,508
You know, I've been thinking, Enid.

873
01:18:13,432 --> 01:18:15,757
For the past couple of years...

874
01:18:15,935 --> 01:18:18,342
...things around here have been...

875
01:18:19,063 --> 01:18:20,391
...stagnant.

876
01:18:20,564 --> 01:18:24,313
Not uncomfortable, mind you, but...

877
01:18:24,485 --> 01:18:27,058
...changeless. Tedious.

878
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,273
Except for last night,
with Vic and Ramona.

879
01:18:30,574 --> 01:18:32,899
They're a sign. They're a revelation.

880
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:36,653
They're squeezing the maximum yield
out of life.

881
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:39,698
Let's get back to the world
of the living.

882
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:43,291
Let's move back to the city.
Or move to the country.

883
01:18:43,462 --> 01:18:45,751
I mean, this is neither.

884
01:18:46,924 --> 01:18:48,715
What do you say?

885
01:18:49,176 --> 01:18:51,632
I understand your restlessness, Earl.

886
01:18:51,804 --> 01:18:53,843
But true change comes only
from within.

887
01:18:54,014 --> 01:18:56,007
- Would you pass the wine?
- You feel it too?

888
01:18:56,183 --> 01:18:57,725
Not a bit.

889
01:18:57,893 --> 01:19:00,563
But I do think the city would be
a good idea.

890
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:02,058
For you, in any case.

891
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:04,974
But I meant for both of us.

892
01:19:05,192 --> 01:19:07,019
If we had the money...

893
01:19:07,403 --> 01:19:09,728
...I think I'd go back to school.

894
01:19:09,905 --> 01:19:11,697
I'd like to...

895
01:19:11,866 --> 01:19:15,863
...intensify my Native American
art studies.

896
01:19:16,036 --> 01:19:18,409
We'll have the money.
We'll sell the house.

897
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:21,154
Vic, here, will buy it.
He's rolling in dough.

898
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:24,916
Why do you think he crashed his plane
into his house and burned it down?

899
01:19:25,129 --> 01:19:26,540
Why, Daddy?

900
01:19:26,755 --> 01:19:29,163
For the insurance money. Right, Vic?

901
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:31,879
How much you have the old place
insured for?

902
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:35,260
He didn't have any insurance.

903
01:19:35,431 --> 01:19:37,091
He never does.

904
01:19:37,516 --> 01:19:38,892
Of course he had insurance.

905
01:19:39,059 --> 01:19:42,345
The bank wouldn't give him a mortgage
without insurance.

906
01:19:44,315 --> 01:19:46,687
He didn't have a mortgage.

907
01:19:48,527 --> 01:19:50,401
You paid cash?

908
01:19:51,197 --> 01:19:53,154
You rented?

909
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:56,107
Do you remember
when your neighbour, Mrs. Warren...

910
01:19:56,327 --> 01:19:59,244
...moved to Riverside Nursing Home
after her husband died?

911
01:19:59,413 --> 01:20:01,785
Well, that's when we met her.

912
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:04,499
Vic used to dress her all the time.

913
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:08,545
Mrs. Warren would always
ask for Vic.

914
01:20:09,798 --> 01:20:11,625
Well, when she died...

915
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,793
...the house was empty,
so we moved in.

916
01:20:15,596 --> 01:20:17,802
Vic said she wouldn't mind.

917
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:21,639
I said it was a steal.

918
01:20:24,063 --> 01:20:26,269
This is really something.

919
01:20:26,732 --> 01:20:29,519
You two ought to be on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

920
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:34,899
Yeah, but now we don't have
no place to live.

921
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:38,319
Daddy, they could live in my room.

922
01:20:38,494 --> 01:20:40,949
Dick's invited me to Florida
for a couple of weeks.

923
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:43,244
His mom won't be there.
She said it's okay.

924
01:20:43,415 --> 01:20:46,784
You stay out of this. You're not going
anywhere and Dick is off-limits.

925
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:49,998
Maybe that's not a bad idea
that Elaine had.

926
01:20:50,172 --> 01:20:52,165
I mean, they could stay
in the guest room.

927
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:55,591
I don't know. That room's loaded
with a lot of furniture and junk.

928
01:20:55,761 --> 01:20:58,762
If we did stay, we'd really need
the big room, facing the road.

929
01:20:59,098 --> 01:21:00,841
The master bedroom?

930
01:21:01,058 --> 01:21:03,383
Hey, don't worry, we'd earn our keep
around here.

931
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:04,931
How wonderful.

932
01:21:05,104 --> 01:21:06,931
- No heavy yard work, though.
- Hernia.

933
01:21:07,106 --> 01:21:09,312
Well, I don't know, it is my bedroom.

934
01:21:09,483 --> 01:21:12,520
I kind of have a sentimental
attachment to it.

935
01:21:12,695 --> 01:21:14,023
I'll tell you what.

936
01:21:14,196 --> 01:21:16,023
With a scrub-down
and some carpentry...

937
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:18,606
...we could make conditions liveable
in the garage.

938
01:21:18,784 --> 01:21:20,065
Garage, huh?

939
01:21:20,703 --> 01:21:24,368
Right. That's it, then.
Ramona, let's hit the road.

940
01:21:24,582 --> 01:21:27,618
Please. Look, I was just kidding.

941
01:21:27,835 --> 01:21:30,871
I want you to stay. Both of you.
You're worth it.

942
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,123
Please stay.

943
01:21:33,299 --> 01:21:34,757
As my friends.

944
01:21:40,097 --> 01:21:41,378
Please.

945
01:21:41,557 --> 01:21:44,048
Stay here, in the outer limits
of the dead-end zone?

946
01:21:44,476 --> 01:21:47,146
Nothing personal, but life
at the end of the road...

947
01:21:47,354 --> 01:21:50,806
...just ain't for Captain Vic
and Empress Ramona.

948
01:21:50,983 --> 01:21:55,360
Sorry, folks, but you can
colour us gone.

949
01:21:58,574 --> 01:22:01,777
Boy, they were neat.

950
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:05,028
They were beyond neat.

951
01:22:05,873 --> 01:22:08,115
They were extraordinary...

952
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:10,119
...unique...

953
01:22:10,878 --> 01:22:12,870
...special.

954
01:22:13,047 --> 01:22:14,790
Earl, can you write me a check?

955
01:22:14,965 --> 01:22:17,836
I'm gonna need some money
this week.

956
01:22:18,761 --> 01:22:21,430
- How much?
- How much is in the account?

957
01:22:21,597 --> 01:22:22,925
I don't know.

958
01:22:23,098 --> 01:22:25,091
Where's the checkbook?

959
01:22:26,644 --> 01:22:28,304
The checkbook!

960
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,972
- I'm hungry again. You wanna eat?
- Oh, yeah.

961
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:36,194
Hold it. Hold it right there, folks.

962
01:22:39,365 --> 01:22:41,322
All right.

963
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:43,402
Let me have it.

964
01:22:43,577 --> 01:22:45,451
What are you talking about
now, Earl?

965
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:49,369
My checkbook. Not that there's
any money left in my account.

966
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:51,000
That's what you think of me?

967
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:53,837
I take your hospitality,
I break bread with your family.

968
01:22:54,004 --> 01:22:55,499
You still think I'd rob you?

969
01:22:55,673 --> 01:22:57,333
Look, just give me the checkbook.

970
01:22:57,508 --> 01:23:01,553
I'm not even gonna talk about
the $32 you stole from me last night...

971
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,713
...when you were
supposed to get dinner...

972
01:23:03,889 --> 01:23:06,297
...and cooked that bogus
spaghetti meal instead.

973
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:07,804
Your checkbook.

974
01:23:07,977 --> 01:23:10,384
It's on the table in the hall,
next to your wallet.

975
01:23:10,563 --> 01:23:13,978
My wallet! Enid?
Look on the table in the hall.

976
01:23:14,191 --> 01:23:16,563
Do you see my wallet
and checkbook there?

977
01:23:17,444 --> 01:23:19,935
Elaine, get ready to call the police.

978
01:23:20,114 --> 01:23:21,991
Oh, Earl.

979
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:24,239
Hey. Kojak.

980
01:23:24,451 --> 01:23:26,491
How much is left in the account?

981
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:31,790
There's $310 left in the account.

982
01:23:31,959 --> 01:23:35,909
Vic spent $17 on pants and a shirt
from Goodwill.

983
01:23:36,088 --> 01:23:40,833
And there's a receipt here for $32...

984
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:43,002
...from Mr. Fong's Fast Chow.

985
01:23:43,179 --> 01:23:46,630
Do you want me to call
the National Guard now, Daddy?

986
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:48,432
- Elaine, get the car.
- What for?

987
01:23:48,601 --> 01:23:51,008
Just do as I ask.

988
01:23:51,187 --> 01:23:52,646
Please.

989
01:23:53,147 --> 01:23:54,855
Give me the wallet.

990
01:23:56,066 --> 01:23:57,976
All right, now...

991
01:23:58,152 --> 01:24:00,773
...I don't want any argument
about this.

992
01:24:01,363 --> 01:24:05,693
This is the least I can do after all
the trouble I've put you two through.

993
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:09,153
I just hope that someday
you can forgive me.

994
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,038
- Here.
- What's that?

995
01:24:11,207 --> 01:24:12,831
It's his vehicle registration.

996
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,456
He just signed over his car to us.

997
01:24:15,628 --> 01:24:16,956
Really, Earl?

998
01:24:17,129 --> 01:24:19,537
Yes. It's all yours.

999
01:24:19,715 --> 01:24:23,250
L... I want you to have it...

1000
01:24:23,427 --> 01:24:26,096
...because, well...

1001
01:24:26,263 --> 01:24:28,470
Because I just want you to have it...

1002
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:31,345
...and to get safely to wherever
you're going.

1003
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:35,647
And, maybe, time and again, you might
think about your old neighbours...

1004
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:37,143
...here on Burt Street.

1005
01:24:37,316 --> 01:24:39,439
What's happening, Daddy?

1006
01:24:40,152 --> 01:24:43,355
Your old man just gave me
his car, honey.

1007
01:24:43,531 --> 01:24:46,567
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, you don't have to say anything.

1008
01:24:46,742 --> 01:24:48,284
It doesn't seem enough.

1009
01:24:48,452 --> 01:24:50,077
Oh, Earl.

1010
01:24:50,246 --> 01:24:53,791
You are the best.

1011
01:24:54,124 --> 01:24:57,576
Hey, come on. Take it easy,
super stud.

1012
01:24:57,753 --> 01:24:59,911
You make me look bad.

1013
01:25:05,135 --> 01:25:08,884
So make sure you take care
of my little Burt Street beauties.

1014
01:25:09,056 --> 01:25:11,179
- I'll try.
- All right.

1015
01:25:14,562 --> 01:25:16,186
Some time we had, huh?

1016
01:25:16,355 --> 01:25:18,928
Don't drive too long.
You haven't had much sleep.

1017
01:25:19,108 --> 01:25:21,350
Remember those shots
I took at you last night?

1018
01:25:21,569 --> 01:25:22,897
Yeah, I remember.

1019
01:25:23,112 --> 01:25:24,523
Come here.

1020
01:25:25,948 --> 01:25:29,115
I knew it was you.
That's why I missed.

1021
01:25:29,994 --> 01:25:31,369
Thanks, Vic.

1022
01:25:31,537 --> 01:25:34,324
Oh, I almost forgot.
Check the sticker on the door panel.

1023
01:25:34,498 --> 01:25:36,989
She'll need an oil change
in about 1000 miles.

1024
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:40,038
Use Wolf's Head Golden 30-weight.

1025
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:41,588
It'll never let you down.

1026
01:25:41,964 --> 01:25:43,838
Thanks, buddy.

1027
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:49,052
Okay, pal.

1028
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:52,175
- Bye, folks.
- Goodbye.

1029
01:25:52,349 --> 01:25:54,887
Oh, we'll miss you.
I wish you weren't going.

1030
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,267
- Don't forget to write, huh?
- Bye.

1031
01:25:57,438 --> 01:25:59,680
Be cool, guys.

1032
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:20,782
<i>And now back to</i>
<i>our afternoon feature...</i>

01:26:27,718 --> 01:26:31,336
Hey, Dad, thanks.
It was far-out. Goodbye.

1036
01:26:31,514 --> 01:26:33,221
- Where you going?
- Back to school.

1037
01:26:34,266 --> 01:26:36,389
Back to school?
I thought you got kicked out.

1038
01:26:36,602 --> 01:26:40,682
Connie Schiff confessed.
They threw her out and cleared me.

1039
01:26:40,856 --> 01:26:44,724
Oh, that's my ride. I gotta go
or I'll miss the train. Bye, Dad.

1040
01:26:50,574 --> 01:26:53,409
- Elaine, I don't want you in that truck!
- I can't hear you.

1041
01:26:53,577 --> 01:26:57,990
I'll call you next week. Don't forget
to mail my allowance. Bye.

1042
01:26:58,165 --> 01:27:00,573
See you later, wart-head.

1043
01:27:06,549 --> 01:27:08,837
Bye, Daddy.

1044
01:27:18,811 --> 01:27:20,139
Where are you going?

1045
01:27:20,312 --> 01:27:24,061
Oh, I have an emergency meeting of my
Native American art study circle.

1046
01:27:24,233 --> 01:27:27,353
- Where'd that getup come from?
- It was a present.

1047
01:27:27,528 --> 01:27:29,070
Oh, that must be Mr. Thundersky.

1048
01:27:29,238 --> 01:27:32,322
- Mr. Thundersky?
- My ride.

1049
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:36,619
- Who the hell is that?
- Don't wait up. Bye.

Ramona!

1066
01:29:21,141 --> 01:29:23,218
I see you still have
the same old wallpaper.

1067
01:29:23,394 --> 01:29:24,436
Hey.

1068
01:29:24,937 --> 01:29:26,976
You two make a sharp couple.

1069
01:29:27,773 --> 01:29:30,311
You wouldn't believe it.
It happened at the same time.

1070
01:29:30,484 --> 01:29:33,900
Vic stared at me. I stared at him.
We both knew it was wrong.

1071
01:29:34,071 --> 01:29:36,194
It's just not gonna be any fun
without you.

1072
01:29:36,365 --> 01:29:38,737
Honest? Does that mean you'll stay?

1073
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:41,400
- We've got plenty of room.
- No, no. We're past that.

1074
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:44,414
- You're coming with us.
- Really?

1075
01:29:44,582 --> 01:29:47,120
Me come with you?
No, you don't mean it.

1076
01:29:47,293 --> 01:29:49,166
Sure we mean it. It'll be a blast.

1077
01:29:49,336 --> 01:29:52,006
Come on, let's go. We're getting old.

1078
01:29:53,007 --> 01:29:55,794
- The dishwasher's on.
- It'll stay on.

1079
01:30:01,098 --> 01:30:04,549
All right, damn it. You're on.
Let's do it.

1080
01:30:04,727 --> 01:30:07,930
This is crazy, but there's something
so right about it. Let's go.

1081
01:30:08,105 --> 01:30:12,352
- Hold it. Not so fast, pal.
- What?

1082
01:30:12,526 --> 01:30:16,394
Don't you think you should
leave a note for Enid?

1083
01:30:16,572 --> 01:30:22,326
You're right. In fact, I'll leave
a little more than just a note.

1084
01:31:38,904 --> 01:31:43,483
No, no, no. Up front,
right next to Captain Vic.

1085
01:31:43,659 --> 01:31:45,533
- Where are we going?
- How should I know?

1086
01:31:45,703 --> 01:31:48,324
You tell me. I'm just driving.

1087
01:31:59,508 --> 01:32:02,545
- Off into the land of the great unknown.
- Look.

1088
01:32:03,095 --> 01:32:06,713
You weren't kidding. You really are
leaving a little more than a note.

1089
01:32:06,891 --> 01:32:10,224
Well, Enid never did like to come home
to a dark house.
