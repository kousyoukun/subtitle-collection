1
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,711
My parents died when
I was very young.

2
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:52,968
I was sent to live with my aunt,

3
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,175
Mrs. Reed and had
children at Gates at Hall.

4
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:00,388
Nearly 10 years I endured
their unkindness and cruelty.

5
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:05,351
They did not love me,
I could not love them.

6
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:16,155
You'll stay there till morning.
Aunt, no, I cannot endure it.

7
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,699
You'll do as you are told.

8
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:01,927
The Reverend Mr. Brocklehurst
is here, Madame.

9
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,825
John.

10
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,237
Good afternoon,
Mr. Brocklehurst.

11
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:18,531
Mrs. Reed.

12
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,450
Do come this way.

13
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,041
My children.

14
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:31,586
Enchanting.

15
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:37,926
Tea?
Perhaps just this once.

16
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:44,559
Pray, be seated.

17
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,770
John, dear,

18
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,772
would you go and find that

19
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,565
wretched girl?

20
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:51,734
Yes, mama.

21
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,612
This has been a very

22
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:57,032
difficult decision, Mr. Brocklehurst.

23
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:58,741
Come on!
She s going!

24
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:02,578
Hooray! She'll never like it.
I can t believe it.

25
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,121
Her mother...

26
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:07,667
was my late husband's sister.

27
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,922
She married a clergyman,
penniless.

28
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,091
Then both parents died

29
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,262
of typhus when she was
a fewmonths old.

30
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,138
Are you her only relative?

31
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,932
There is...

32
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:22,643
an uncle.

33
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,062
Her father's brother.

34
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,398
But he lives abroad in...

35
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:29,900
Madeira,
I know nothing of him.

36
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,238
Go on.

37
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,724
I have done what I can

38
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:38,226
for the child,

39
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,602
but she has a

40
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,689
willful obstinate nature.

41
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,651
Ah, here she is.

42
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:49,697
This is Jane Eyre.

43
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:55,078
Jane, This is Mr. Brocklehurst
of Lowood School.

44
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,080
How do you do, sir?

45
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,668
I hear you are a wicked child,
Jane Eyre.

46
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,921
Let me examine you.

47
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,640
Do you know where
the wicked go after death?

48
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:16,601
To Hell.

49
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,648
What is Hell?

50
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,316
Can you tell me that?

51
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:25,153
A pit full of fire.

52
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,491
And should you like to fall
into that pit

53
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,786
and to burn there forever?

54
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,829
No, sir.

55
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,539
What must you do

56
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:36,999
to avoid it?

57
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,628
Keep well and not die.

58
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:43,923
It is as I said.

59
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,842
You must warn her teachers

60
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,137
to keep an eye on her,

61
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:53,058
and to guard
against her worst fault,

62
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,894
her tendency to deceit.

63
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:58,523
Deceit?

64
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,611
We do not tolerate that
at Lowood.

65
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,654
That's why I wrote to you.

66
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,743
I want her to be
brought up in a manner

67
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,411
befitting her prospects.

68
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:12,622
To be made useful,

69
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,708
to be kept humble.

70
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,628
And... As for the vacations...

71
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,298
I would prefer...

72
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:24,801
if she spent them...

73
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,428
with you.

74
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:27,888
Of course.

75
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:31,600
Come.

76
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:36,356
Deceit is a sin.

77
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,817
It is akin to falsehood.

78
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:43,281
And all liars shall
spend eternity in that lake,

79
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,909
burning with
brimstone and fire.

80
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,871
- I'm not deceitful.
- I beg your pardon?

81
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,873
I'm not deceitful,

82
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:54,084
and I'm not a liar.

83
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,712
If I were,
I should say I loved you.

84
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:00,633
I do not love you,

85
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:03,802
I dislike you worst of anybody
in the world...

86
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:04,720
except your son.

87
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,639
Your bags, Jane Eyre.

88
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:13,272
Did you see

89
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,774
what a wicked child she is?

90
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,695
Have no fear, Mrs. Reed,

91
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,948
at Lowood we shall
tame her unruly spirit.

92
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,359
The stool.

93
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,531
Place this child upon it.

94
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:30,416
You see this...

95
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,626
this girl?

96
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,176
Her name is Jane Eyre.

97
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,512
Be on your guard
against her.

98
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:43,681
Avoid her company.

99
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:47,351
Shut her out
of your conversations.

100
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,231
This girl,
take a good look at her,

101
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,192
this girl is a liar.

102
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,821
Let her stand on this stool all day.

103
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:59,615
She shall have no food.

104
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,452
And let no one speak to her.

105
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:11,937
Alice.

106
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,877
Pay attention.

107
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,764
Back to your lessons.

108
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:52,190
Let her sing with us.

109
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:35,512
Jane.

110
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,391
What?

111
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,354
Some bread and cheese.

112
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:45,105
Thank you.

113
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:54,032
What is your name?

114
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,118
Helen Burns.

115
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,162
Thank you, Helen.
God bless you.

116
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,125
And you too, Jane.

117
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:07,088
Goodnight.

118
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:32,742
Hands...

119
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,453
Bonnet...

120
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:36,996
Shoes.

121
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:39,999
Hands.

122
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,668
Bonnet.

123
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,212
Bonnet, Jones!

124
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,092
Burns, you are on the side

125
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,511
of your shoes.
Your toes out immediately.

126
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,097
Your chin is poking out.

127
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,224
Your head up!

128
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:58,228
I will not have
you so slovenly.

129
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,689
Cover your mouth!

130
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,652
Dirty, disagreeable girl.

131
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,197
You haven't cleaned
your nails.

132
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,116
The water was frozen.

133
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:11,951
That is no excuse.

134
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,456
Fetch me the birch.

135
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,423
Obstinate girl.

136
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:27,259
Nothing will cure you

137
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:28,307
of your

138
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:30,304
slatternly habits.

139
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,432
Sorry, Miss Scatcherd.

140
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:34,851
Put it away.

141
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,230
Cleanliness...

142
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:40,858
is next to Godliness.

143
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,031
Time for your lessons.

144
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:54,456
You destroyed our day now!
No one likes you.

145
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,085
Go sit down,
I'll see you in a minute.

146
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,976
Who taught you to draw?
I taught myself.

147
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,562
I used to look at
my Aunt s books

148
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,732
and copy the pictures.

149
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,485
- You draw very well.
- Not really.

150
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,196
You do. You have a gift.
You re lucky.

151
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,910
Helen.

152
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,330
- Can I draw a portrait of you?
- Me?

153
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,333
Yes.

154
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,296
Take off your bonnet,
you have pretty hair.

155
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:20,551
Who's that girl with red hair?

156
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,098
Burns, sir. Helen Burns.

157
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,276
Burns, step forward.

158
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,001
Vanity.

159
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,511
You see this vanity?

160
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,493
Long curled hair,
masses of red curls.

161
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,067
It is in defiance of our principle
of this school.

162
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:54,622
You know that as I do.

163
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,469
It was my fault, sir.

164
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:58,096
I told her to take it off.

165
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:01,857
I don't care about a bonnet.
It's her hair, her vanity.

166
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:05,755
It's not vanity, Mr. Brocklehurst.
Helen's hair curls naturally.

167
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:09,965
And does she not sin
naturally as well?

168
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,772
I'm hear teach you discipline.

169
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,875
I am here to correct nature,
so are you Miss Temple.

170
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:18,640
Let me try to arrange hair so
it doesn't offend you.

171
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:22,061
Offending me is not the issue.
It is the child's

172
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:24,690
vanity must be suppressed.

173
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:27,472
Remove far from me

174
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,244
vanity and lies.

175
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:31,931
Proverbs.
Chapter 30, verse 8.

176
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:36,450
- The girl's hair shall be cut off.
- No!

177
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,640
Did someone speak?

178
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,810
You'd punish her for the way
God made her?

179
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:49,734
Fetch the scissors.

180
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:53,700
You, Jane Eyre.

181
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:01,847
Did you hear what I've said?

182
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,376
I will not ask you again.

183
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,229
Your hair will
grow again soon.

184
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,987
And if it is cut again,
it will grow again.

185
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:14,450
And it will be
more beautiful than before.

186
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,250
Come, into bed.

187
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:33,595
I'm sure you feel
very sorry for yourselves.

188
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,183
I'm sure you all

189
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:41,146
envy other girls who seem
to be blessed with happier lives.

190
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:43,649
But you...

191
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,027
have all been blessed
with intelligence.

192
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:51,699
Intelligence
and a proper education

193
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:55,161
will give you independence
of spirit,

194
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,330
and that is
the greatest blessing of all.

195
00:18:58,374 --> 00:19:01,417
The only thing that matters
in your life

196
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:04,046
is to be in harmony
with God.

197
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:07,049
- What is this?
- Come, into bed.

198
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:08,925
Go to bed!

199
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,220
Immediately!
All of you!

200
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,430
Miss Temple!

201
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,942
I'm worried about Helen Burns.

202
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:26,613
- Her cough is much worse.
- Most of girls have a cough.

203
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,907
I think we should call the doctor.

204
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,704
Only Mr. Brocklehurst
can do that.

205
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,664
Then I shall talk with him.

206
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:38,917
No, Miss Temple.
I will.

207
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,017
Helen?

208
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,536
Jane?

209
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:15,788
Is that you?

210
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,837
What are you doing here?

211
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:23,671
It's gone eleven.

212
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:27,090
I couldnt sleep
till I'd seen you.

213
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:32,188
Your feet are bare.

214
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,817
Lie down.

215
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,487
Cover yourself
with my quilt.

216
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,296
Don't cry.

217
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,965
You mustn't cry.

218
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,551
Please don't leave me.

219
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:04,558
We'll be together again.

220
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,539
When?

221
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,477
Where?

222
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:09,980
Be together

223
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:11,440
in Heaven...

224
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:12,775
forever, and always.

225
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:14,610
Will we?

226
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,575
Don't you believe that?
I dont know.

227
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:26,498
You must believe it, Jane.
You must believe...

228
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:29,084
God will take care of us.

229
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,091
Goodnight,

230
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:37,010
dearest Jane.

231
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,431
Helen!

232
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:21,809
Mr. Brocklehurst.

233
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:24,020
Mr. Brocklehurst.

234
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:27,107
I've found her, sir.

235
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:34,140
Burns.

236
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,588
Burns.

237
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,068
I'll tend to it, sir.

238
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,806
Don't grieve, Jane.

239
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:06,608
She's gone to a better place.

240
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:10,395
May God have mercy
on her soul.

241
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:12,948
Come, Jane.

242
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:16,013
You must hurry, Jane.
The coach is here.

243
00:25:24,985 --> 00:25:27,447
I hope you don't think
I'm being ungrateful.

244
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,782
Ungrateful,
what do you mean?

245
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:33,787
Ever since I've come to Lowood,
you've been my true friend,

246
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:35,247
apart from Helen.

247
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:38,418
- I feel I'm abandoning you.
- No, no.

248
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:40,962
You mustn't think that.

249
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:43,215
No. It's good

250
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:46,300
and proper for you
to start a new life.

251
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,471
I wish you could come.

252
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:51,139
Thank you.

253
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,227
But...

254
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,397
I believe it is God's will
I'm here.

255
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:00,775
I cannot leave.

256
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,245
God bless you.

257
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:27,784
How much further?

258
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:37,627
If Miss Eyre,

259
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:41,466
who advertised in the Yorkshire
Herald last Thursday,

260
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,468
is in a position to give

261
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:45,387
satisfactory references

262
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,265
as to character
and competency,

263
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,184
a situation can be
offered to her.

264
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:52,643
There is but one pupil,

265
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:55,689
a little girl
under ten years of age.

266
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:59,026
The salary is 30 pounds
per annum.

267
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,279
Miss Eyre is requested

268
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,991
to send references, name,
address

269
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,288
and all particulars
to Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall.

270
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:26,807
- Goodbye, Miss.
- Goodbye.

271
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:28,266
Goodbye, young lass.

272
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:54,587
Come in, Miss.

273
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,301
Come in.

274
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,682
Leah!

275
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:07,142
It's the new Governess.

276
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:24,275
Would you follow me, Miss?

277
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,491
Mrs. Fairfax.

278
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:33,869
Mrs. Fairfax.

279
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:35,287
Miss Eyre.

280
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,626
How do you do, my dear?

281
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:44,255
I'm afraid you've had a tedious journey.
You must be frozen.

282
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,590
Let me help you.

283
00:28:46,924 --> 00:28:49,094
- Don't trouble yourself.
- No trouble.

284
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:53,391
Your hands must be numb with cold.
Come to the fire

285
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:55,059
and get warm.

286
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:56,936
There.
And I dare say

287
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,231
a hot drink would be
most welcome too.

288
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:01,691
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

289
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,693
Leah, cut a sandwich or two.

290
00:29:04,457 --> 00:29:06,084
- Do sit down my dear.
- Thank you.

291
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,126
The key.

292
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:09,920
- What?
- The key, Mrs. Fairfax.

293
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:13,404
Here.

294
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:16,991
If Adele is still awake,
ask her to come down.

295
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:18,617
Yes, Mrs. Fairfax.

296
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:23,242
The child keeps
the most impossible hours.

297
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:24,744
Her mother

298
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:27,830
must have kept her up
the entire evening.

299
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:29,249
She isn't your daughter?

300
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:32,294
Oh, no, no.

301
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,338
No, her name is Varens...
Adele Varens.

302
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:37,424
No, I have no family.

303
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:44,265
I am glad, I'm so glad

304
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:45,683
you are come.

305
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:50,188
One can feel so isolated here,
especially in the winter.

306
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:55,193
It will be most pleasant for me
to have someone to converse with

307
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,112
on terms of equality.

308
00:29:58,155 --> 00:29:59,615
Of course to be sure,

309
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:04,079
John and his wife Leah
are very decent people...

310
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,249
Here is your charge.

311
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,042
Come, Adele.

312
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,255
This lady will teach you

313
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:14,756
and make a clever woman
of you.

314
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:17,384
My governess?

315
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:20,638
That's right.
You may call me Miss Eyre.

316
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:23,642
You speak French!
May we speak in French?

317
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:27,145
Yes, Adele, but we're
with Mrs. Fairfax now,

318
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:29,315
and in her presence
it is more polite,

319
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,899
if we try to speak in English.

320
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:31,984
You understand

321
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,694
when she runs on like that?

322
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:34,570
Oh yes.

323
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,573
Shall I sing?
My mama taught me to sing.

324
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:38,950
Where is your mama?

325
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:41,578
Gone. She flew away

326
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,204
to the Holy Virgin.

327
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:45,291
She taught me
to dance and sing.

328
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,125
Shall I sing for you, now?

329
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,960
In the morning, Adele.

330
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:50,337
It's late.

331
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:53,966
And it is time you were in bed.
Come along.

332
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:58,680
We shall come up
and hear your prayers.

333
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:01,725
This way, my dear.

334
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:07,774
Come on, Miss.

335
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:13,529
Thornfield is a fine old hall,
perhaps a little neglected,

336
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:17,326
but that could be remedied
if Mr. Rochester would come home.

337
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:19,244
Who is Mr. Rochester?

338
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:23,837
Why, he is the Master
of this house.

339
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:26,711
But you will never see him.
He never stops here.

340
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,671
Of course he does,
sometimes.

341
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,216
He brought you here,
didn't he?

342
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,802
But it is true,
he is usually away.

343
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:38,807
Will we be very happy?

344
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:43,146
We shall work hard
and be content.

345
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:48,235
- Goodnight, Adele. Say your prayers.
- Goodnight, Miss Eyre.

346
00:31:49,236 --> 00:31:50,862
Goodnight, Mrs. Fairfax.

347
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:53,282
Goodnight, Adele.

348
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,122
I'll not keep you up all night.

349
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:02,833
I'm sure you'll want
to retire early.

350
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,922
And your room is just along here
near to Adele.

351
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:10,217
It is small, but I thought
you'd like it better

352
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:12,093
than the ones in front.

353
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:16,808
They're larger, but so solitary.
No one ever sleeps there.

354
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,352
One would almost say

355
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:23,607
if there was a ghost at Thornfield,
that would be its haunt.

356
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:26,818
Now, here is your room.

357
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,745
This is for me?

358
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,664
Why, is anything the matter?

359
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,168
Tomorrow I'll discover
this is a dream

360
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,129
from which I must awaken.

361
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,884
We are real,

362
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:52,972
and you are most welcome here,
most welcome.

363
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:56,893
Goodnight my dear. Sleep well.
Thank you, Mrs. Fairfax.

364
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:18,833
Up here

365
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,086
is the main gallery.

366
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:25,258
What a handsome place.

367
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:28,761
I had the windows opened
to let in the air.

368
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:29,763
Everything gets

369
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:32,933
so damp in rooms
that are seldom entered.

370
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,352
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

371
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:45,780
Here are the Master's rooms.

372
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:00,505
Is that Mr. Rochester?

373
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:01,839
Oh, no.

374
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,759
His father.

375
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,680
Why Mr. Rochester keeps it
here despite everything,

376
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:10,807
I do not know.
One of his strange ways.

377
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:16,021
His father and his brother

378
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:19,441
were very unfair to him.

379
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:23,488
Some would say barbarous.

380
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:26,699
He was the youngest son,
you see.

381
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,535
And he was expected

382
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:31,622
to sacrifice everything
for the family.

383
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,089
He only inherited Thornfield
nine years ago.

384
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:49,391
When he was a child,
he was a gentle boy.

385
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,771
He's clearly not barbarous
if he s taking care of Adele.

386
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,231
Oh, no.

387
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:59,361
No, Mr. Rochester does accept
his responsibilities.

388
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:03,824
He's a just and liberal
landlord to his tenants.

389
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:06,618
He's well travelled

390
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,830
and very intelligent.

391
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:12,709
But when he talks to you,
you can't be sure

392
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:15,295
whether he is in jest
or in earnest.

393
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:19,132
Whether he is pleased
or the contrary.

394
00:35:24,346 --> 00:35:26,515
He is not a happy man.

395
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,228
Oh my goodness, those flowers!

396
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:35,483
I keep telling Leah that all the
rooms must be kept in readiness.

397
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:38,404
Mr. Rochester's visits
may be rare,

398
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,322
but we are never warned.

399
00:36:00,343 --> 00:36:01,553
What was that?

400
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:06,768
One of the servants most likely,
Grace Poole.

401
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:07,977
Did you hear it?

402
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:09,354
Oh, yes.

403
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:12,232
I often hear it.

404
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:17,113
She does sewing in
one of these rooms.

405
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:20,409
Grace!

406
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,789
Too much noise!

407
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,416
Remember instructions.

408
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,589
We can go back this way.

409
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:16,720
Your arithmetic
is not very good, Adele.

410
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,598
It s dull.
I don t care for it.

411
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:22,439
Why can't we do something else?

412
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:24,979
It's my job to give
you a good education.

413
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,399
Arithmetic is
an important part of that.

414
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,195
Mama said it was important
to sing and dance.

415
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:33,445
That wasn't dull.

416
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:37,534
If you re good,
I'll teach you the piano.

417
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:38,994
Will you?

418
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,663
- When?
- Perhaps tomorrow.

419
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:45,793
- Why not now?
- Arithmetic today, piano tomorrow.

420
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:50,006
I'm going for a walk,
and when I come back,

421
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,802
I want to see how many
of those sums

422
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:55,888
you have got right.

423
00:37:56,138 --> 00:38:02,103
- But they're so difficult.
- You can do it, I know you can.

424
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:22,565
Are you injured, sir?

425
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:29,490
Can I do anything?

426
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:35,079
You can stand to my side.

427
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,261
If you're hurt,
I can fetch some help.

428
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,764
Thank you. I shall do.
I have no broken bones.

429
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,437
Go on then.

430
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:01,030
I cannot think of leaving you here, sir.

431
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,570
Until I see you are able
to mount your horse.

432
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,864
You should be at home yourself.

433
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:08,533
Where do you come from?

434
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,035
There.

435
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,498
That house
with the battlements?

436
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:15,040
Yes, sir.

437
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:19,170
Whose house is it?

438
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,754
Mr. Rochester's.

439
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,135
Do you know Mr. Rochester?

440
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,262
I have never seen him.

441
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,350
What is your position there?

442
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,435
I'm the Governess.

443
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,313
Aah, the Governess.

444
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:42,695
I believe I must ask
your help after all.

445
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,031
If you'll be so kind. Yes sir.

446
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,992
Would you get hold
of my horse's bridle

447
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:48,410
and lead him to me?

448
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:52,456
You are not afraid?

449
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:54,666
No, sir.

450
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:10,309
The mountain will
never come to Mahomet,

451
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,686
so help Mahomet
go to the mountain.

452
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:14,397
Would you come here?

453
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:18,693
Excuse me.

454
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,364
Necessity compels me
to make use of you.

455
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:45,932
Thank you.
Would you hand me my hat?

456
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,266
And crop.

457
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:54,900
Thank you for your help.

458
00:41:58,404 --> 00:41:59,197
Now...

459
00:42:03,242 --> 00:42:05,244
make haste home as fast

460
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:07,037
as you can.

461
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,141
Whose dog is this?

462
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:25,767
He came with the Master.

463
00:42:26,101 --> 00:42:28,270
With whom?
The Master.

464
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:29,897
Mr. Rochester.

465
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,148
He just arrived.

466
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:43,536
Here is Miss Eyre, sir.

467
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:52,380
I trust the leg more comfortable?

468
00:42:52,588 --> 00:42:54,298
Doctor will be here
in the morning.

469
00:42:55,424 --> 00:42:57,719
Let Miss Eyre be seated.

470
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,561
Look what Mr. Rochester
has brought me.

471
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:09,398
Have you brought
Mademoiselle a present?

472
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:12,610
Did you expect a present?
Are you...

473
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,156
fond of presents?

474
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:19,742
I hardly know, sir.

475
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:21,954
I have little experience
of them.

476
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:23,663
They are thought pleasant.

477
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:26,375
Generally thought so,

478
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,670
but what do you think?

479
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:31,798
A present has many faces,
has it not?

480
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,220
How long have you been
in my house?

481
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:37,596
Four months.

482
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:39,432
And you came from?

483
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:41,558
Lowood School, Lancashire.

484
00:43:42,226 --> 00:43:43,352
Lowood!

485
00:43:45,104 --> 00:43:46,272
How long were you there?

486
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:47,731
Ten years.

487
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:49,233
Eight as a pupil,

488
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,902
two as a teacher.

489
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:55,198
You must be tenacious to have
survived that place so long.

490
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:59,203
You have
the look of another world.

491
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,708
When I saw you, I thought
of fairy tales and almost asked

492
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,794
if you'd bewitched my horse.

493
00:44:07,129 --> 00:44:09,715
I'm not sure yet,
it is she

494
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,842
who is responsible
for my sprain.

495
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:15,178
There was ice on the road.
It caused your horse

496
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,430
to slip.

497
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:18,682
Perhaps.

498
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,310
I'm not sure yet.

499
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:26,482
Very well, Miss Eyre.

500
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:30,279
I bid you good night.

501
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:47,797
Adele.

502
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:49,841
Watch and listen.

503
00:44:54,054 --> 00:44:55,389
You mean like this?

504
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,064
I have examined Adele.

505
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:06,985
You have taken great
pains with her.

506
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:11,824
She's not bright,
she's no particular talent,

507
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:14,411
yet she's made
much improvement.

508
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:17,331
- She's worked hard.
- You are teaching her piano?

509
00:45:17,665 --> 00:45:19,750
- Yes, sir.
- Are you fond of music?

510
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,044
Do you play well?

511
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:22,585
I'm very fond of music.

512
00:45:22,877 --> 00:45:23,920
I play a little.

513
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,341
Like any other
English schoolgirl.

514
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,677
Perhaps better than some,
but not...

515
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,678
well.

516
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:34,182
Adele showed me some sketches.

517
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,896
She said they were yours.

518
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,568
I don t know if they
were of your doing...

519
00:45:44,777 --> 00:45:46,696
Perhaps some master helped you?

520
00:45:46,946 --> 00:45:48,281
No one helped me, sir.

521
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,035
That wounds your pride.

522
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:57,963
These pictures must have taken
much time.

523
00:46:00,418 --> 00:46:01,545
When did you do them?

524
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:03,923
In the last two vacations
I spend to Lowell.

525
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:05,425
Did you copy them?

526
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:07,343
They came out of my head.

527
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:10,304
That head I see now
on your shoulders?

528
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:12,266
Yes, sir.

529
00:46:14,935 --> 00:46:17,939
Has it other furniture
of the same kind within?

530
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:19,732
I think it may have.

531
00:46:20,066 --> 00:46:21,276
Better, I hope.

532
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:29,785
Were you happy
when you painted them?

533
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:33,538
I couldn't paint what was
in my imagination.

534
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:36,250
I always wanted to achieve more.

535
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:41,422
You may have
insufficient technique...

536
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:48,597
but the thoughts are magical.

537
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,768
Ah, nine o'clock.

538
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:56,189
- Is Adele in bed?
- Not yet, sir.

539
00:46:56,398 --> 00:47:00,277
She should be in bed.
I don't approve of these late hours.

540
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:02,612
See to it, Miss Eyre.

541
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,211
I would do the edges darker.

542
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:25,304
His leg is better.

543
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:27,724
He will be going away soon.

544
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:29,142
Perhaps.

545
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:33,189
It will break my heart.

546
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:36,315
It's this one here.

547
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:41,988
Could you draw me a picture of him?

548
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,158
To always have him with me.

549
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,330
You examined me,
Miss Eyre.

550
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:29,666
Do you think me handsome?

551
00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:31,669
No, sir.

552
00:48:32,879 --> 00:48:36,550
There is something singular
about you. The air of a little nun,

553
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,556
quaint, quiet, grave and simple.

554
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:40,804
But when asked a
question,

555
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:45,016
or makes a remark to which you are
obliged to answer, you rap out a reply

556
00:48:45,267 --> 00:48:48,186
which is at least brusque.
What do you mean by it?

557
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:50,772
Sir, I was too plain.
I beg your pardon.

558
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,859
I should have replied
that tastes differ.

559
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:58,323
That beauty is of little consequence.
Something about that sort.

560
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,328
You will endure my surliness
without being hurt.

561
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:09,794
Very few masters would trouble
themselves to enquire, wheater or not

562
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:12,297
if their employees
were offended.

563
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:15,509
You never laugh, Miss Eyre?

564
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:18,386
Never mind.

565
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:23,100
Let me see what my paid employee
has been drawing in her sketch book.

566
00:49:28,397 --> 00:49:29,399
May I?

567
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,459
You have me utterly.

568
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:52,465
No, no, it's mine.

569
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:04,854
Come with me, Miss Eyre.

570
00:50:07,273 --> 00:50:10,402
Adele, continue with your work.
And remember...

571
00:50:11,236 --> 00:50:13,531
shadows are as important
as light.

572
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:23,459
Do you believe that?
What, sir?

573
00:50:25,376 --> 00:50:28,588
That shadows are as
important as light?

574
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:32,217
I believe none of us is perfect,

575
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,928
I believe none of us is
without some fault to hide.

576
00:50:42,062 --> 00:50:46,024
You are not naturally austere
any more than I'm naturally vicious.

577
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:52,824
I once had a heart
full of tender feelings.

578
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:58,162
But fortune has knocked
me about.

579
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:03,251
Now I'm as hard and tough
as an India rubber ball.

580
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:16,266
You think there is
there any hope for me?

581
00:51:16,558 --> 00:51:17,810
Hope for what, sir?

582
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:22,315
My being transformed from India rubber
back to flesh and blood.

583
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:27,528
Come, Pilot.

584
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:48,259
Is all well, my dear?

585
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,512
What a strange man!

586
00:51:51,262 --> 00:51:53,598
So changeful and abrupt.

587
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:57,061
I suppose I ve grown
accustomed to it.

588
00:51:58,187 --> 00:52:01,774
- And one has to make allowances.
- Why?

589
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:05,444
Partly because it s his nature,

590
00:52:05,611 --> 00:52:08,072
and none of us
can help our nature.

591
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:11,451
Partly...
family troubles.

592
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,453
He doesn't have a family.

593
00:52:14,288 --> 00:52:16,332
There are painful memories

594
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:18,959
which are perhaps
best forgotten.

595
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,803
Well done, Adele.

596
00:53:08,055 --> 00:53:10,016
Is that how mama
danced for you?

597
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,436
Precisely.

598
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:16,230
Exactly.

599
00:53:18,149 --> 00:53:18,983
Now...

600
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:24,782
Off to bed.
Fairfax, take her out.

601
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:26,992
Oh no mesieur,
let me stay a while longer.

602
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:29,329
Let me dance again.
You heard me what I said.

603
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,246
Please!

604
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:31,503
Don't argue.

605
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:32,874
Do as you are told.

606
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,418
Come, Adele.

607
00:53:35,418 --> 00:53:36,712
Come.

608
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,892
Well?

609
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:54,815
Treat me as you will,
but you should not treat a child thus.

610
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,692
I will treat her
however I see fit.

611
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,989
When I look at Adele,

612
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:04,743
I see a miniature
of her mother.

613
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:06,494
The same...

614
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:10,374
beauty,
the same merciless charm.

615
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,045
She was an opera dancer.

616
00:54:14,337 --> 00:54:16,756
I was not the first
to love her,

617
00:54:16,964 --> 00:54:20,009
but she told me that I...

618
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:22,344
was Adele's father.

619
00:54:24,054 --> 00:54:26,516
At the time I wanted
to believe that.

620
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:31,146
But one night, I found her in
the arms of a brainless viscount.

621
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:34,400
I left a bullet
in his feeble wing,

622
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:38,195
gave her my purse
and ordered her away from me.

623
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:39,739
So...

624
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:42,492
perhaps you'll think
differently of the child.

625
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:46,413
Perhaps you'll soon be telling me
I should look for a new Governess.

626
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:49,417
Adele is not responsible
for her mother's faults.

627
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,294
- Or yours.
- Or mine?

628
00:54:51,377 --> 00:54:53,169
What have I done but play
the village idiot?

629
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:55,089
You've made Adele
feel unwanted and unloved.

630
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,468
Why didn't she leave her in Paris,
where she was happy?

631
00:54:58,718 --> 00:54:59,594
Because

632
00:54:59,844 --> 00:55:01,721
her mother abandoned her.

633
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:07,144
When I looked around
I was all she had left.

634
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:11,941
And I do honor
my obligations.

635
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,864
However they were incurred.

636
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,327
No one can deny me that.

637
00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:28,917
Goodnight, Miss Eyre.

638
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:41,699
Mr. Rochester!

639
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:43,041
Mr. Rochester, wake up!

640
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,912
Wake up, sir, please!

641
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:05,939
Is there a flood?

642
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:10,041
Come, Mister.

643
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,911
More water!

644
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,421
What happened?

645
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,256
I don't know.

646
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:09,020
I heard a strange laugh.

647
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:10,342
Grace.

648
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,176
Where are you going?

649
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,826
Stay here, don't move.

650
00:58:18,823 --> 00:58:20,575
Wrap yourself in my cloak.

651
00:58:22,285 --> 00:58:23,411
You re soaked.

652
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:42,964
Grace!

653
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:48,940
Open the door, Grace.

654
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,794
It was as I thought.

655
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:20,005
- Grace Poole, sir?
- Quiet so.

656
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:22,966
You should send her away.

657
00:59:24,384 --> 00:59:27,012
Say nothing of this business.

658
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,224
I will answer for

659
00:59:30,432 --> 00:59:31,434
all this.

660
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:38,817
You can go to your room,
There s nothing more to fear.

661
00:59:48,153 --> 00:59:49,717
Goodnight then, sir.

662
00:59:50,945 --> 00:59:51,863
What?

663
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,126
Are you leaving me?

664
00:59:55,253 --> 00:59:56,419
You told me to go.

665
00:59:57,796 --> 01:00:00,841
Not in that brief, dry fashion.
Not without...

666
01:00:03,218 --> 01:00:04,428
taking leave.

667
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:06,138
At least,

668
01:00:07,557 --> 01:00:08,809
shake hands.

669
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:16,984
The roses had thorned.

670
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,867
You have saved my life.

671
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:32,996
I am in your debt.

672
01:00:32,835 --> 01:00:34,253
There is no debt,

673
01:00:34,628 --> 01:00:36,005
no obligation.

674
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:40,614
I knew you'd do me good
at some time.

675
01:00:40,676 --> 01:00:43,263
I saw it in your eyes
when I first beheld you.

676
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:47,559
I'm glad I happened
to be awake.

677
01:00:52,697 --> 01:00:54,490
What's the matter?
You re shivering.

678
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,528
I'm cold.

679
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:01,992
Cold?

680
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:05,363
You are cold?

681
01:01:06,074 --> 01:01:07,075
Yes, sir.

682
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,362
Go then, Jane.

683
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:15,738
Go back to bed.

684
01:01:26,806 --> 01:01:28,308
You call that clean?

685
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:32,687
You and I are going
to have words downstairs.

686
01:01:39,945 --> 01:01:40,945
Good morning, Miss Eyre.

687
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:43,073
What happened?

688
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,243
The Master was reading in bed
last night.

689
01:01:46,275 --> 01:01:50,280
He feel asleep with a candle lit
and the curtains got on fire.

690
01:01:50,698 --> 01:01:54,201
Luckily he woke up in time
to put the flames out.

691
01:01:54,409 --> 01:01:55,953
Here you are.
Hang them all.

692
01:01:56,203 --> 01:01:57,830
Did nobody hear anything?

693
01:01:57,997 --> 01:01:59,123
Did nobody wake up?

694
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:00,858
Perhaps you heard something?

695
01:02:02,502 --> 01:02:04,546
Yes, Grace... I did.

696
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:07,091
I heard someone laughing.

697
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:09,760
If I were you, Miss,

698
01:02:10,343 --> 01:02:14,806
I'd get in the habit of bolting
my door when I went to bed at night.

699
01:02:20,271 --> 01:02:23,483
Leah, that's one, and two...

700
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,070
Good morning.

701
01:02:26,945 --> 01:02:28,071
Oh, Miss Eyre!

702
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,533
I supose you've heard about
the master's accident?

703
01:02:30,825 --> 01:02:32,744
It is a mercy he wasn't burnt

704
01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:34,912
in his bed. Leah!

705
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:38,541
Is he all right?
Yea, well enough...

706
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:41,712
to be up for the sun and
gone before breakfast.

707
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:43,463
Gone? Gone where?

708
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:47,300
To Lord Ingram's,
the other side of Millcote.

709
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,846
There's quite a party
assembled there. Pillows.

710
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:53,516
Do you expect him back tonight?

711
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,767
Oh, no.

712
01:02:55,017 --> 01:02:57,228
Nor tomorrow night either.

713
01:02:57,812 --> 01:03:01,733
When these fashionable people get
together, they are in no hurry.

714
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:05,321
They may go to London
or the Continent.

715
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:10,785
Mr. Rochester may not be back
for a year.

716
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:14,915
He's quite a favourite
with the ladies.

717
01:03:15,123 --> 01:03:16,083
Miss Blanche

718
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,793
has been at him for years.

719
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:19,461
Miss Blanche?

720
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:22,923
Lord Ingram's daughter.
Prettiest girl in the county.

721
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,258
She is, Miss.

722
01:03:24,716 --> 01:03:26,385
Does the Master like her?

723
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,597
Oh, yes!

724
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,310
He is a different man
when he is with her.

725
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,605
So merry and lively
you wouldn't know him.

726
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:38,441
Ah, Leah.

727
01:03:57,789 --> 01:03:59,083
You are a fool.

728
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:07,640
I'll help you with this sheet.

729
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:10,767
Hurry.
They'll be coming soon.

730
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,066
James, hurry.
Take them to the dining room.

731
01:04:18,443 --> 01:04:20,278
My corner to your corner.

732
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:25,533
Ms. Fairfax, have you something
we can keep a frog in?

733
01:04:25,783 --> 01:04:27,243
- A what?
- A frog.

734
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:30,038
My dear,
I have no time for frogs.

735
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,666
Mr. Rochester
may be here any minute

736
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:35,628
and all of Lord Ingram's friends
with him.

737
01:04:35,879 --> 01:04:37,839
He's never done this before.

738
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:41,134
They'll bring their maids
and their valets.

739
01:04:41,468 --> 01:04:44,513
In the past he couldn't wait
to leave Thornfield,

740
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:47,850
now it seems he's determined to fill
the house with guests.

741
01:04:53,447 --> 01:04:55,616
- They are coming!
- What?

742
01:05:01,205 --> 01:05:04,583
Mademoiselle,
the beautiful ladies are coming!

743
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,172
Lady Ingram.

744
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,717
And Lady Eshton.

745
01:05:12,718 --> 01:05:14,177
Yes, and Lady Lynn.

746
01:05:17,306 --> 01:05:18,850
And that, of course,

747
01:05:19,476 --> 01:05:20,643
is Miss Blanche.

748
01:05:24,397 --> 01:05:25,899
- This way.
- Thank you.

749
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:46,617
Do you think Mr. Rochester is in love
with Miss Ingram?

750
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:49,203
You shouldn't ask such a question.

751
01:05:49,995 --> 01:05:50,788
Why not?

752
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,339
Because it's none of our affair.

753
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,043
It would be
if they got married.

754
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:57,045
Adele, stop this conversation.

755
01:05:58,004 --> 01:05:59,422
Go back to your work.

756
01:06:01,466 --> 01:06:03,010
I hope he doesn't marry her.

757
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:07,931
A maid told Leah she's only
interested in his money.

758
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,767
She said he brought back a fortune

759
01:06:09,808 --> 01:06:11,393
- from Jamaica.
- Adele!

760
01:06:21,905 --> 01:06:23,031
Miss Eyre!

761
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:29,705
Mr. Rochester wants you
to bring Adele to the party,

762
01:06:29,873 --> 01:06:31,249
and he wants you to stay

763
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,585
until it is her bedtime.

764
01:06:33,627 --> 01:06:35,296
Surely, he doesn't want me to stay?

765
01:06:35,336 --> 01:06:36,213
Oh, yes.

766
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,798
"If she objects, tell her

767
01:06:39,048 --> 01:06:40,842
it is my particular wish."

768
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:43,595
Those were his very words.

769
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:20,678
Bon Soir Medame.

770
01:07:21,011 --> 01:07:22,054
Good evening.

771
01:07:22,555 --> 01:07:23,890
What a little puppet!

772
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,226
That must be Mr. Rochester's ward.

773
01:07:26,434 --> 01:07:28,645
The little French girl.

774
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,523
- What's your name, child?
- Adele, madame.

775
01:07:31,732 --> 01:07:32,900
So pretty, how charming.

776
01:07:32,942 --> 01:07:36,487
Edward, I thought
you were not fond of children.

777
01:07:37,197 --> 01:07:38,155
Nor am I.

778
01:07:38,657 --> 01:07:41,451
What persuaded you to take
charge of this little creature?

779
01:07:42,744 --> 01:07:44,246
Where did you pick her up?

780
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,666
I did not pick her up.
She was left on my hands.

781
01:07:48,876 --> 01:07:50,294
You should send her
to school.

782
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:53,589
Not sure I could afford it,
schools are so expensive.

783
01:07:55,132 --> 01:07:56,592
You look after her, yourself?

784
01:07:57,343 --> 01:07:58,511
We have a Governess.

785
01:07:59,012 --> 01:08:02,140
A Governess.
Yes, I thought I saw someone

786
01:08:02,391 --> 01:08:03,809
with her just now.

787
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:06,362
You can tell a Governess
at first glance.

788
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:09,315
They are plain,

789
01:08:09,648 --> 01:08:11,234
in a very special way.

790
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:13,111
Aren't they, Mama?

791
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,280
Aren't to what, my darling?

792
01:08:15,363 --> 01:08:16,406
Governesses.

793
01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:18,700
Don't talk to me
about Governesses.

794
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:21,870
The very word makes me
tremble with rage.

795
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,414
I have suffered a martyrdom

796
01:08:24,623 --> 01:08:26,166
in their incompetence.

797
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,295
What?

798
01:08:29,712 --> 01:08:30,593
Nothing.

799
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,881
Have I said something wrong?

800
01:08:32,882 --> 01:08:35,301
She is sitting just
behind you.

801
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:37,387
Who is?

802
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,471
The Governess.

803
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,060
Never mind.
It may do her

804
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,478
good to hear the truth.

805
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:47,307
Come along...

806
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:51,194
time for dancing.
I have been idle long enough.

807
01:08:51,403 --> 01:08:52,446
Bianca, will you do me

808
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:53,613
the great honour?

809
01:08:54,656 --> 01:08:56,450
I didn't know you were a dancing man.

810
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:58,264
He only dances with me.

811
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,456
Who else would I want to dance with?

812
01:09:00,558 --> 01:09:02,436
Mrs. Bennet, will you play for us?

813
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:55,181
Jane!
You look pale.

814
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:58,748
- Was my dancing so clumsy?
- No, sir.

815
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,146
Come back to the drawing room,
it is too early to go to bed.

816
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:04,024
I'm tired, sir.

817
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,109
And a little depressed.

818
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,419
What about?
Tell me!

819
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:15,189
- Nothing, sir. I'm not depressed.
- But you are.

820
01:10:16,642 --> 01:10:20,814
A few more words would bring
tears to your eyes.

821
01:10:21,459 --> 01:10:24,421
- Did I see them there now?
- Excuse me, sir.

822
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:26,912
- I'm very tired.
- Very well.

823
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:28,154
I'll excuse you tonight,

824
01:10:28,408 --> 01:10:29,304
but so long as my visitors stay,

825
01:10:29,405 --> 01:10:32,972
I would like you to appear
in the drawing room every evening.

826
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:37,837
It is my wish, Jane,
don't ignore it.

827
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:56,039
May I help you, sir?

828
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:58,000
I...

829
01:10:59,376 --> 01:11:01,003
I'd like to see Mr. Rochester.

830
01:11:01,587 --> 01:11:03,215
We have a house full of guests.

831
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:06,176
Mr. Rochester and I, are old...

832
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:11,681
old friends,
and I am very tired.

833
01:11:12,474 --> 01:11:16,186
I have come a long way to see him.
All the way from Jamaica.

834
01:11:25,655 --> 01:11:27,115
May I have your name, sir?

835
01:11:27,907 --> 01:11:29,075
Mason...

836
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,828
Richard Mason.

837
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,664
Peter.

838
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:38,503
Take this gentleman
to the tapestry bedroom.

839
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:53,769
Damn your luck, Dent!

840
01:11:59,067 --> 01:12:00,652
Anything else, sir?

841
01:12:02,153 --> 01:12:03,321
No, thank you.

842
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:09,519
Jane,
I need your help.

843
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:10,895
What is it?

844
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,650
Come with me.

845
01:13:19,113 --> 01:13:21,741
You don't turn sick
at the sight of blood?

846
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:24,159
I don't think so.

847
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:26,412
Give me your hand.

848
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:29,082
It won't do to risk
your fainting.

849
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:37,967
Here, Jane.

850
01:13:39,135 --> 01:13:41,054
There's a sponge
on the washstand.

851
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:43,181
Try to stop the bleeding.

852
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:46,101
I'll fetch the doctor.
I won't be long.

853
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:29,856
I'll give you half an hour

854
01:14:31,108 --> 01:14:33,235
to dress his wound
and get him out.

855
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:41,078
Why did you come,
why, why on earth?

856
01:14:41,328 --> 01:14:42,871
I thought
I could do some good.

857
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:44,207
You thought.

858
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:47,210
You thought!

859
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,337
She said shed

860
01:14:49,587 --> 01:14:51,923
drain my heart.

861
01:14:53,633 --> 01:14:57,680
Keep him at your house until he's quite
well. I'll ride over in a day or two.

862
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:03,560
Have pity on her.

863
01:15:04,358 --> 01:15:05,526
Let her be treated tenderly.

864
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,149
- Let her be...
- Yes.

865
01:15:08,357 --> 01:15:09,859
I do my best.

866
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,654
And will continue to do so.

867
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:17,869
- It is not her fault.
- I know that.

868
01:15:18,077 --> 01:15:20,162
If anyone's to blame,
it's you.

869
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:22,040
Go.

870
01:15:32,718 --> 01:15:34,428
Ace of spades.

871
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:36,806
You have the devil's own luck
Rochester.

872
01:15:37,056 --> 01:15:40,393
You know what they say.
Lucky in cards, unlucky in love.

873
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:42,882
Penny, off you go
with the other guests.

874
01:15:44,147 --> 01:15:46,066
I'm bored with this game.

875
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,319
Why don't we play
something else?

876
01:15:50,571 --> 01:15:52,073
What would you like to play?

877
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:56,786
Lord Brancaster has a billiard
table. You shoud buy one.

878
01:15:56,994 --> 01:15:58,038
I adore billiards.

879
01:15:58,371 --> 01:16:00,123
They are rather expensive.

880
01:16:00,373 --> 01:16:01,959
I'm not sure
I could afford one.

881
01:16:04,628 --> 01:16:06,630
Does that person want you?

882
01:16:14,138 --> 01:16:15,347
Is something wrong?

883
01:16:15,557 --> 01:16:16,765
May I speak to you, sir?

884
01:16:17,475 --> 01:16:18,643
7 card whist?

885
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,280
What is it?

886
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,027
I received a letter
this morning.

887
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:29,530
Please sir,
I wan't leave of absence.

888
01:16:29,572 --> 01:16:30,490
Why?

889
01:16:31,741 --> 01:16:35,079
- An old lady who is sick.
- What old lady?

890
01:16:35,276 --> 01:16:37,987
Her name is Mrs. Reed.
She's my aunt.

891
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,170
- I thought you had no relatives.
- None that would own me.

892
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,598
Mrs. Reed cast me off
when I was a child.

893
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:47,878
- Then why go off to see her?
- She's dying.

894
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,637
I can't ignore her dying wish.

895
01:16:52,722 --> 01:16:54,558
You won't be
persuaded to stay?

896
01:16:55,726 --> 01:16:56,810
No, sir.

897
01:16:57,686 --> 01:16:59,647
I will return to Thornfield.

898
01:17:02,858 --> 01:17:04,736
So you and I must say goodbye.

899
01:17:05,862 --> 01:17:06,863
Yes, sir.

900
01:17:10,075 --> 01:17:12,995
How does one perform that ceremony?
Teach me.

901
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:17,208
They say farewell.
Or any form they prefer.

902
01:17:20,628 --> 01:17:22,213
Farewell, Miss Eyre.

903
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:28,011
For the present.

904
01:17:30,722 --> 01:17:31,848
Is that all?

905
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:33,475
Yes, sir.

906
01:17:35,895 --> 01:17:37,480
Why don't we shake hands?

907
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,370
Remember your promise.

908
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:29,662
Mr. Rivers?

909
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:31,372
Miss Eyre is here.

910
01:18:32,665 --> 01:18:33,708
Miss Eyre.

911
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:37,754
St. John Rivers, Rector of
Gateshead. How do you do?

912
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:39,047
Please come in.

913
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,385
Your aunt is most anxious
to see you.

914
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,303
Your family is in trouble.

915
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,266
John Reed, your cousin,
died last month in London.

916
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,684
He died. How?

917
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:52,771
They say, he ruined his health
with bad company.

918
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,649
It was his death that brought on
your aunt's illness.

919
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,610
This is, my sister, Mary.

920
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:01,446
Mary, I'm taking her to see her aunt.

921
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:03,198
I should be back presently.

922
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:26,057
You are like...

923
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,147
Why, you are like...

924
01:19:32,814 --> 01:19:34,358
Jane Eyre.

925
01:19:35,358 --> 01:19:36,444
I am Jane Eyre.

926
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:41,407
I am very ill.

927
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,459
My mind is much troubled

928
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:54,005
by two wrongs
I have done you.

929
01:19:55,632 --> 01:19:56,550
One...

930
01:19:57,508 --> 01:20:01,305
was breaking my promise
to my husband...

931
01:20:02,055 --> 01:20:03,432
to bring you up as

932
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:05,350
one of my own.

933
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:07,102
The other...

934
01:20:08,186 --> 01:20:10,564
Go to my writing case.

935
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:15,153
Take out the letter
you'll find there.

936
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:33,880
Read the letter.

937
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,815
"Madame, will you have the goodness
to send me the address of my niece,

938
01:20:49,065 --> 01:20:50,107
"Jane Eyre,

939
01:20:50,567 --> 01:20:52,360
"and to tell me how she is.

940
01:20:53,278 --> 01:20:57,783
"It is my intention to ask her
to come to me at Madeira.

941
01:20:59,612 --> 01:21:01,989
"As I am unmarried
and childless...

942
01:21:02,092 --> 01:21:04,761
"I wish to adopt her
during my life...

943
01:21:05,182 --> 01:21:07,351
"and bequeath her at my death...

944
01:21:07,436 --> 01:21:09,605
"whatever I may
have to leave."

945
01:21:13,298 --> 01:21:15,384
This is dated 3 years ago.

946
01:21:17,012 --> 01:21:18,806
Why did he never write to me?

947
01:21:21,464 --> 01:21:23,133
I wrote to him...

948
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:29,399
I told him I knew
nothing about you.

949
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:36,675
Now, act as you please.

950
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,246
Write to him...

951
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,556
tell him I lied.

952
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:51,424
You were born to be
my torment.

953
01:21:54,178 --> 01:21:55,846
I am not vindictive.

954
01:21:56,973 --> 01:21:58,683
Let us be friends.

955
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:08,444
Love me or hate me as you will.

956
01:22:09,904 --> 01:22:12,490
You have my full
and free forgiveness.

957
01:22:28,006 --> 01:22:30,969
I wish she would come back.

958
01:22:58,651 --> 01:22:59,651
Mademoiselle!

959
01:22:59,837 --> 01:23:03,173
I thought you'd left for good.
I told you I'd come back.

960
01:23:03,671 --> 01:23:06,257
You said a week.
It's almost a month.

961
01:23:06,383 --> 01:23:07,675
Forgive me, Adele.

962
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:10,575
Mr. Rochester
is sending me to a school.

963
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,927
I was afraid I would be gone

964
01:23:13,274 --> 01:23:15,527
- and never see you again.
- To school?

965
01:23:15,685 --> 01:23:16,769
To Paris.

966
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:18,479
A school for young ladies.

967
01:23:22,025 --> 01:23:22,817
Adele.

968
01:23:24,903 --> 01:23:27,488
Go, tell cook
Miss Eyre has returned.

969
01:23:28,323 --> 01:23:29,949
Another place at dinner.

970
01:23:31,701 --> 01:23:33,370
I'll ask her
to make a special cake.

971
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:44,257
So, you came back after all?

972
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:45,884
As I promised.

973
01:23:47,928 --> 01:23:49,305
As you promised.

974
01:24:14,611 --> 01:24:16,613
You are very quiet
this evening.

975
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,467
What's on your mind?

976
01:24:23,984 --> 01:24:25,278
Many things, sir.

977
01:24:25,803 --> 01:24:27,054
My aunt's death.

978
01:24:27,513 --> 01:24:29,432
Being back at Thornfield.

979
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:31,518
And?

980
01:24:34,145 --> 01:24:36,981
Adele tells me you are sending
her away to school.

981
01:24:37,273 --> 01:24:38,024
Yes.

982
01:24:40,277 --> 01:24:44,030
It's a good idea, don't you think?
Paris is her home after all.

983
01:24:45,866 --> 01:24:47,493
May I ask why, sir?

984
01:24:48,661 --> 01:24:50,830
I thought you might
have guessed.

985
01:24:53,627 --> 01:24:54,633
Perhaps...

986
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:57,004
because you're
going to be married.

987
01:25:00,002 --> 01:25:01,128
Exactly.

988
01:25:02,383 --> 01:25:03,509
Precisely.

989
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:08,808
With your usual acuteness,
you have hit the nails on the head.

990
01:25:10,309 --> 01:25:11,769
I am to be married.

991
01:25:14,731 --> 01:25:17,442
Which means Adele
will go to a school.

992
01:25:19,737 --> 01:25:21,572
And you'll need to find another situation.

993
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:26,160
- I will advertise directly...
- No, you will not.

994
01:25:26,202 --> 01:25:28,246
I have heard of a position
that might suit you.

995
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:30,582
Governess to 5 daughters

996
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:32,459
of a family in Ireland.

997
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,503
It is a long way off.

998
01:25:36,672 --> 01:25:38,946
No matter a girl of your sense
won't object to the voyage.

999
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:40,404
Not the voyage,
but the distance...

1000
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:42,206
And the sea is such a barrier.

1001
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:46,475
From what, Jane?

1002
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,560
From England, sir.

1003
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,230
And from Thornfield.

1004
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:53,607
And...

1005
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:02,408
Sometimes I have the strangest
feeling about you...

1006
01:26:03,535 --> 01:26:06,205
Especially when you are near,
as you are now.

1007
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,665
It feels as though I had a string

1008
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:14,998
tied here, under my left rib,
where my heart is.

1009
01:26:17,592 --> 01:26:21,555
Tightly knotted to you...
in a similar fashion.

1010
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:25,058
When you go to Ireland,

1011
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,562
with all that distance
between us,

1012
01:26:29,855 --> 01:26:32,817
I'm afraid this cord
will be snapped...

1013
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:35,862
and I shall bleed inwardly.

1014
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,365
But you are sensible.

1015
01:26:38,657 --> 01:26:40,909
- You'll forget.
- I'll never forget!

1016
01:26:41,953 --> 01:26:43,663
I wish I had never been born.

1017
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:45,624
I wish I'd never come
to Thornfield.

1018
01:26:45,655 --> 01:26:47,741
There are other houses just as fine.

1019
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:49,960
How can you be so stupid?

1020
01:26:50,586 --> 01:26:52,463
How can you be so cruel?

1021
01:26:53,089 --> 01:26:56,677
I may be poor and plain,
but I'm not without feelings.

1022
01:26:57,677 --> 01:27:00,014
It's not the house,
but the life here.

1023
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,766
I was not trampled on.

1024
01:27:02,766 --> 01:27:04,519
I was not excluded.

1025
01:27:05,311 --> 01:27:07,605
I was treated as an equal.

1026
01:27:11,985 --> 01:27:13,821
And so you are, Jane.

1027
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:30,505
And so...

1028
01:27:34,092 --> 01:27:35,218
And so...

1029
01:27:38,723 --> 01:27:40,141
Yes, so, sir...

1030
01:27:41,017 --> 01:27:43,812
And yet not so,
for you are a married man.

1031
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,898
Or as good as married.

1032
01:27:46,523 --> 01:27:47,941
- Let me go.
- Be still.

1033
01:27:49,735 --> 01:27:53,427
Don't struggle. You are like
a bird clawing at its cage.

1034
01:27:53,463 --> 01:27:57,118
I'm no caged bird. I'm
a free human being, independent,

1035
01:27:57,368 --> 01:27:58,994
with a will of my own.

1036
01:28:01,164 --> 01:28:02,248
Then stay.

1037
01:28:05,419 --> 01:28:06,795
Stay and marry me.

1038
01:28:07,504 --> 01:28:10,549
- How dare you make fun of me?
- I mean what I say.

1039
01:28:11,377 --> 01:28:13,839
Stay at Thornfield.
Be my wife.

1040
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:16,181
What of Miss Ingram?

1041
01:28:16,472 --> 01:28:19,309
I don't love Miss Ingram,
nor does she love me.

1042
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:26,609
Jane, you strange,
almost unearthly thing,

1043
01:28:28,278 --> 01:28:30,738
I love you
as my own flesh.

1044
01:28:34,325 --> 01:28:36,035
I beg of you to marry me.

1045
01:28:40,499 --> 01:28:43,502
Say Edward, give me my name.

1046
01:28:46,673 --> 01:28:49,050
Say Edward, I will marry you.

1047
01:28:58,465 --> 01:28:59,257
Yes.

1048
01:29:00,763 --> 01:29:01,681
Yes.

1049
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:05,526
Yes, Edward.

1050
01:29:19,299 --> 01:29:21,594
I hardly know what to say.

1051
01:29:21,043 --> 01:29:24,881
I'm so astonished,
I feel I must have been dreaming.

1052
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:30,637
I thought Mr. Rochester
came in here

1053
01:29:31,179 --> 01:29:32,515
and said...

1054
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:36,936
that in a month's time
you were to be his wife.

1055
01:29:37,853 --> 01:29:39,522
He said the same to me.

1056
01:29:40,898 --> 01:29:42,775
You know how much I like you,

1057
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,319
Jane, but...

1058
01:29:46,571 --> 01:29:47,864
you are so young...

1059
01:29:49,074 --> 01:29:51,576
and little acquainted with men.

1060
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,915
I have noticed

1061
01:29:56,123 --> 01:29:59,711
Mr. Rochester is growing
fondness for you...

1062
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:03,632
And I have wanted
so many times...

1063
01:30:05,717 --> 01:30:07,386
for your sake,

1064
01:30:07,678 --> 01:30:09,848
to put you on your guard.

1065
01:30:10,222 --> 01:30:11,223
Why?

1066
01:30:12,683 --> 01:30:14,560
There is an old saying...

1067
01:30:15,394 --> 01:30:18,147
"All is not gold
that glitters."

1068
01:30:20,275 --> 01:30:22,736
And in this case I fear...

1069
01:30:24,946 --> 01:30:27,408
something different...

1070
01:30:27,825 --> 01:30:29,619
may be found...

1071
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:32,330
from what you or I expect.

1072
01:30:32,622 --> 01:30:35,334
Is it impossible
that Mr. Rochester

1073
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:37,461
should have a sincere
affection for me?

1074
01:30:37,586 --> 01:30:38,754
Oh, no, no.

1075
01:30:39,004 --> 01:30:41,090
It is not that,
my dear, it's...

1076
01:30:42,967 --> 01:30:44,677
He is a proud man.

1077
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:46,679
All the Rochesters
were proud.

1078
01:30:49,182 --> 01:30:51,559
And gentlemen in his station

1079
01:30:51,893 --> 01:30:55,021
are not accustomed to marrying
their governesses.

1080
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,127
Now, then...

1081
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:18,339
Let's try the cape on,
shall we?

1082
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:20,674
There... Turn around.

1083
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:22,426
Turn around, dear.

1084
01:31:23,218 --> 01:31:26,264
Oh, you look beautiful.

1085
01:31:34,231 --> 01:31:37,610
- Have you been to the chapel?
- Yes sir, the parson just arrived.

1086
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:39,946
- The carriage?
- The horses have been harnessed.

1087
01:31:40,196 --> 01:31:43,345
- We'll leave the moment it s over.
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:31:43,393 --> 01:31:46,730
- Jane!
- Yes, I'm here.

1089
01:31:55,892 --> 01:31:57,102
Any regrets?

1090
01:31:58,532 --> 01:32:02,745
Only that Adele is away at school. She'd have
loved to see me in this dress.

1091
01:32:03,347 --> 01:32:05,474
I will have a portrait painted

1092
01:32:05,724 --> 01:32:08,352
and sent to her.

1093
01:32:09,728 --> 01:32:10,813
Like this,

1094
01:32:10,855 --> 01:32:11,689
with the morning light above you.

1095
01:32:35,256 --> 01:32:38,009
We are gathered together
in the sight of God...

1096
01:32:38,969 --> 01:32:42,556
to join together
this man and this woman

1097
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:44,308
in Holy Matrimony.

1098
01:32:46,393 --> 01:32:49,940
... so many as are coupled together
but as God's word

1099
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,400
both allow,

1100
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:53,735
are not joined together by God...

1101
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,987
The marriage cannot go on.

1102
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:58,574
I declare an impediment.

1103
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,038
- Continue, sir.
- I cannot.

1104
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:07,500
What is the nature
of this impediment?

1105
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:13,840
Mr. Rochester

1106
01:33:14,278 --> 01:33:15,529
is a married man.

1107
01:33:18,095 --> 01:33:20,598
- Who are you?
- My name is Briggs.

1108
01:33:21,057 --> 01:33:22,183
I'm a lawyer.

1109
01:33:22,225 --> 01:33:24,310
I was engaged to look after
the interests

1110
01:33:24,561 --> 01:33:26,188
of your wife.

1111
01:33:26,224 --> 01:33:27,814
There is no wife!

1112
01:33:27,898 --> 01:33:32,652
'I affirm and can prove that
on the 20th day of October 1829,

1113
01:33:33,487 --> 01:33:37,950
Edward Fairfax Rochester of
Thornfield Hall, was married

1114
01:33:38,492 --> 01:33:39,618
to my sister,

1115
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:41,829
Bertha Antoinetta.

1116
01:33:42,246 --> 01:33:43,456
A copy of the wedding

1117
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:47,002
certificate is now
in my possession.'

1118
01:33:47,043 --> 01:33:50,214
Signed, Richard Mason.

1119
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:55,845
That proves I have been married,
not that the women is still living.

1120
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:59,432
She was living three months ago.
I have a witness to the fact.

1121
01:33:59,974 --> 01:34:01,268
Produce him, damn you!

1122
01:34:01,434 --> 01:34:03,187
Sir, do not forget you are in

1123
01:34:03,228 --> 01:34:04,105
a sacred place.

1124
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:07,732
Have the goodness
to step forward, sir.

1125
01:34:13,822 --> 01:34:14,990
Mason!

1126
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:28,297
Close your book.

1127
01:34:30,717 --> 01:34:32,302
There'll be no wedding.

1128
01:34:36,264 --> 01:34:38,433
What these men say is true.

1129
01:34:39,643 --> 01:34:41,269
I have been married...

1130
01:34:45,107 --> 01:34:47,693
the woman to whom
I was married lives still.

1131
01:34:52,782 --> 01:34:54,367
Come to the house,
all of you...

1132
01:34:55,452 --> 01:34:58,372
and meet Grace Pooles patient...

1133
01:34:59,456 --> 01:35:01,041
My wife!

1134
01:35:24,567 --> 01:35:26,861
Stay out of the way, Grace.

1135
01:35:27,905 --> 01:35:29,031
Be careful, sir.

1136
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:31,283
She's a bit snappish.

1137
01:35:36,247 --> 01:35:39,041
She's seen you, sir,
you'd better not stay.

1138
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:41,252
- We'd better leave.
- You stay here!

1139
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,546
This is my wife.

1140
01:35:44,006 --> 01:35:45,633
Your sister, Mason.

1141
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:49,052
Look at her. She is mad.

1142
01:35:49,135 --> 01:35:50,679
So was her mother.

1143
01:35:52,223 --> 01:35:53,349
So was her grandmother.

1144
01:35:55,017 --> 01:35:58,396
Three generations
of violent lunacy.

1145
01:35:58,433 --> 01:35:59,564
I wasn't told

1146
01:35:59,814 --> 01:36:01,607
about that,
was I, Mason?

1147
01:36:01,899 --> 01:36:03,485
Or I was told about

1148
01:36:03,527 --> 01:36:06,530
was that my father had made a
suitable match to prop up

1149
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:08,824
his dwindling fortune
and give your family

1150
01:36:09,074 --> 01:36:10,701
the Rochester name.

1151
01:36:11,535 --> 01:36:13,788
I did what I was told!

1152
01:36:18,293 --> 01:36:19,711
And Bertha

1153
01:36:21,212 --> 01:36:23,715
was kept away from me

1154
01:36:24,132 --> 01:36:25,843
until the wedding.
It was cleverly done.

1155
01:36:28,137 --> 01:36:30,264
Everyone got what they wanted

1156
01:36:30,722 --> 01:36:31,974
except me.

1157
01:36:33,267 --> 01:36:34,352
Even

1158
01:36:35,228 --> 01:36:37,939
she is better off here than
she would be in a lunatic asylum...

1159
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:41,610
but I have spent
the last 15 years in torment.

1160
01:36:48,576 --> 01:36:50,244
So what I...

1161
01:36:50,412 --> 01:36:52,122
what I wish to have.

1162
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,209
This young girl who stands
so grave and quiet to the month

1163
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:57,377
of Hell.

1164
01:36:57,878 --> 01:36:58,879
Look at the difference

1165
01:37:02,383 --> 01:37:04,385
Then judge me!

1166
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:08,890
Priest on the gospell
and man of the law

1167
01:37:08,926 --> 01:37:11,893
and remenber with what judgement
he judge he

1168
01:37:23,281 --> 01:37:24,908
Bertha!
No, Ma'am.

1169
01:37:27,202 --> 01:37:29,870
Hold her down!

1170
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,041
Keep calm, lass, calm.
Hold her, Grace.

1171
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:34,251
Take care.

1172
01:37:34,293 --> 01:37:35,669
Calm, calm, lass.

1173
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:12,001
I love you.

1174
01:38:12,794 --> 01:38:14,170
Say you love me.

1175
01:38:16,547 --> 01:38:18,257
I love you more than ever.

1176
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:21,344
But this is the last time
I shall ever say it.

1177
01:38:22,388 --> 01:38:23,722
I must leave you.

1178
01:38:54,214 --> 01:38:56,174
Don't leave me, Jane!

1179
01:39:07,104 --> 01:39:08,062
The horse!

1180
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:23,162
Mr. Rochester!

1181
01:39:25,206 --> 01:39:27,209
Mr. Rochester!
The house, sir!

1182
01:40:08,462 --> 01:40:11,173
Trust me, Bertha, trust me.
Leah...

1183
01:40:11,423 --> 01:40:13,551
John, where's Mr. Rochester?

1184
01:40:14,469 --> 01:40:16,471
Mr. Rochester, help me!

1185
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:18,681
Help me, somebody!

1186
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:32,614
Bertha.

1187
01:40:33,858 --> 01:40:36,903
Bertha, come close to me,
don't be afraid.

1188
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:38,600
Come to me.

1189
01:40:39,203 --> 01:40:40,455
Please, give me your hand.

1190
01:40:41,052 --> 01:40:42,471
Bertha, come to me.

1191
01:40:42,844 --> 01:40:44,513
- No.
- I would never harm you.

1192
01:40:46,022 --> 01:40:48,191
Don't be afraid.
Come to me, now.

1193
01:40:49,177 --> 01:40:50,136
Please.

1194
01:40:51,274 --> 01:40:52,108
Come, come on.

1195
01:40:56,348 --> 01:40:57,349
No!

1196
01:41:07,589 --> 01:41:08,590
Jane!

1197
01:41:22,377 --> 01:41:27,382
With no direction or wilth to
my future, I travelled for many days

1198
01:41:31,386 --> 01:41:37,810
At last, as prompted by old memories,
I made my way back to home of parson.

1199
01:41:38,478 --> 01:41:40,772
That once was kind to me.

1200
01:41:41,815 --> 01:41:44,985
And this is for you!
Thank you! Good day to you!

1201
01:41:48,488 --> 01:41:50,157
Is Miss Eyre, isn't it?

1202
01:41:51,492 --> 01:41:55,413
Do you, remember me? I'm Mary Rivers,
the rector's sister.

1203
01:41:58,499 --> 01:41:59,541
Are you ill?

1204
01:42:14,392 --> 01:42:16,603
- How is she?
- She's had a good sleep.

1205
01:42:16,645 --> 01:42:18,479
Now may be a good time
to talk to her.

1206
01:42:23,026 --> 01:42:25,363
- How are you feeling?
- You're looking much better.

1207
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:27,281
The doctor is very pleased.

1208
01:42:27,531 --> 01:42:30,118
You should be well enough
to come down in a few days.

1209
01:42:30,743 --> 01:42:32,953
I have been here almost a month.

1210
01:42:33,245 --> 01:42:35,581
I can't stay here any longer.

1211
01:42:35,706 --> 01:42:38,251
I must find work
and somewhere to live.

1212
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:40,086
Hush, be still.

1213
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,881
You should stay as long as you wish.

1214
01:42:42,715 --> 01:42:46,344
Don't make her talk any more.

1215
01:42:46,594 --> 01:42:47,636
Tell her.

1216
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:52,601
Miss Eyre.

1217
01:42:54,728 --> 01:42:57,356
I did not want to excite
you beyond your strength,

1218
01:42:57,393 --> 01:42:59,316
but I have some very surprising news.

1219
01:43:00,067 --> 01:43:02,779
A gentleman has been here
looking for you.

1220
01:43:03,113 --> 01:43:03,987
A lawyer.

1221
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:07,867
I took it upon myself
to act on your behalf.

1222
01:43:08,033 --> 01:43:09,035
A lawyer.

1223
01:43:10,036 --> 01:43:11,246
What did he want?

1224
01:43:13,456 --> 01:43:17,753
It seems your uncle in Madeira,
John Eyre, has died

1225
01:43:18,003 --> 01:43:19,880
and has left you his entire estate.

1226
01:43:20,631 --> 01:43:22,096
He always believed you were alive

1227
01:43:22,132 --> 01:43:25,053
and he had the greatest faith
that one day you would be found.

1228
01:43:26,221 --> 01:43:28,640
You are his only
surviving relative.

1229
01:43:31,394 --> 01:43:33,145
You have become a wealthy woman.

1230
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:40,319
These are the papers relating
to your uncle,

1231
01:43:40,611 --> 01:43:44,407
and the fortune
you will inherit.

1232
01:43:45,658 --> 01:43:47,452
This is your uncle, John Eyre.

1233
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:54,043
And this is your father...

1234
01:43:54,752 --> 01:43:56,462
the father you never knew.

1235
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:00,467
How young he looks.

1236
01:44:01,175 --> 01:44:02,511
And how kind.

1237
01:44:02,761 --> 01:44:03,846
He was kind.

1238
01:44:05,056 --> 01:44:07,641
Amongst the papers
is the letter he wrote

1239
01:44:08,017 --> 01:44:10,603
to your uncle announcing
your birth.

1240
01:44:15,441 --> 01:44:17,193
You were deeply loved Miss Eyre.

1241
01:44:20,864 --> 01:44:22,032
Please forgive me.

1242
01:44:24,743 --> 01:44:26,328
There is nothing to forgive.

1243
01:44:33,003 --> 01:44:35,380
I know you have suffered greatly.

1244
01:44:37,424 --> 01:44:39,426
But the past can no longer
harm you.

1245
01:44:42,013 --> 01:44:43,556
You are safe now.

1246
01:44:48,763 --> 01:44:51,183
As the months past,
my health recovered

1247
01:44:51,517 --> 01:44:53,066
and my strength returned.

1248
01:44:54,066 --> 01:44:58,197
The more I knew them,
the better I like them.

1249
01:45:08,757 --> 01:45:11,640
But despite their
generosity and kindness

1250
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:15,588
my thoughts were constantly
drawn back to the past.

1251
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:20,054
The places and people
I could not forget.

1252
01:45:35,571 --> 01:45:37,574
Jane!

1253
01:45:47,584 --> 01:45:48,586
Jane!

1254
01:45:56,593 --> 01:46:00,223
You have been with us now
for nearly six months

1255
01:46:00,259 --> 01:46:02,981
and in that time I have come to
respect you

1256
01:46:03,018 --> 01:46:06,813
and to admire you very much.

1257
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:09,918
I don't expect you to love me, now,

1258
01:46:09,954 --> 01:46:12,951
undoubtedly enough
of love would follow

1259
01:46:12,987 --> 01:46:16,825
upon marriage to render the
union right even in your eyes.

1260
01:46:18,535 --> 01:46:21,251
All I'm asking you for
is your affection,

1261
01:46:21,288 --> 01:46:25,126
your care,
your companionship.

1262
01:46:25,162 --> 01:46:26,502
You have all those things.

1263
01:46:26,538 --> 01:46:27,466
Jane!

1264
01:46:27,502 --> 01:46:33,926
What I'm offering you is trustworthy
and good, it is real it is lasting.

1265
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:39,933
I'm very touched by what you say,
but I cannot decide now.

1266
01:46:40,433 --> 01:46:42,144
You must give me time to think.

1267
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,145
Of course!

1268
01:46:44,146 --> 01:46:46,195
But however I decide, I shall give

1269
01:46:46,232 --> 01:46:50,111
part of my inheritance to benefit
the girls at Lowell school.

1270
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:52,703
And, please, I want you to take

1271
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,117
whatever you need for
your mission in rework.

1272
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:58,120
Would you arrange it for me?

1273
01:48:57,251 --> 01:48:58,335
Mrs. Fairfax?

1274
01:49:05,843 --> 01:49:06,928
Pilot.

1275
01:49:08,008 --> 01:49:08,905
Hello, Pilot.

1276
01:49:09,102 --> 01:49:09,858
Pilot!

1277
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:15,186
Pilot!

1278
01:49:19,206 --> 01:49:20,416
No more noise.

1279
01:49:23,363 --> 01:49:24,363
Miss Eyre!

1280
01:49:36,878 --> 01:49:38,212
Mrs. Fairfax,

1281
01:49:39,255 --> 01:49:41,049
bring me a glass of water.

1282
01:49:57,107 --> 01:49:58,151
Who's there?

1283
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:00,612
Who is it?

1284
01:50:02,155 --> 01:50:03,323
Pilot knows me.

1285
01:50:09,872 --> 01:50:12,041
My brain will burst.

1286
01:50:14,931 --> 01:50:17,058
What delusion is this?

1287
01:50:19,842 --> 01:50:21,384
What sweet madness!

1288
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:28,517
Her fingers.

1289
01:50:28,809 --> 01:50:30,102
Her very fingers.

1290
01:50:31,145 --> 01:50:32,355
Jane Eyre.

1291
01:50:33,356 --> 01:50:34,566
Jane Eyre.

1292
01:50:36,985 --> 01:50:39,655
So many times I've dreamed
of this moment.

1293
01:50:40,113 --> 01:50:42,992
Then the dream vanishes
and flies away.

1294
01:50:47,205 --> 01:50:49,833
Gentle dream.
Kiss me before you go.

1295
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:51,710
I shall never leave you.

1296
01:51:05,641 --> 01:51:07,518
You will stay with me?

1297
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:10,730
How?

1298
01:51:11,648 --> 01:51:15,694
I will be your friend,
your nurse, your companion.

1299
01:51:16,946 --> 01:51:20,116
You will not be left alone
for so long as shall I live.

1300
01:51:33,314 --> 01:51:35,984
I'm no better than a ruined tree.

1301
01:51:38,677 --> 01:51:42,056
I'm lightning struck
and decayed.

1302
01:51:42,557 --> 01:51:43,892
You are no ruin, sir.

1303
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:47,020
You are vigorous
and full of life.

1304
01:51:48,521 --> 01:51:51,776
Plants will grow
and wind around you,

1305
01:51:52,484 --> 01:51:55,572
because your strength offers them
so safe a hold.

1306
01:52:18,138 --> 01:52:20,557
And so I married him.

1307
01:52:21,349 --> 01:52:23,227
Slowly but surely,

1308
01:52:23,435 --> 01:52:25,980
Edward recovered his sight.

1309
01:52:26,272 --> 01:52:28,691
And when our first born
was put into his arms,

1310
01:52:28,942 --> 01:52:32,153
he could see that our child
had inherited his eyes

1311
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:33,863
as they once were,

1312
01:52:34,114 --> 01:52:36,657
large and brilliant

1313
01:52:36,825 --> 01:52:38,618
and shining with life.

1314
01:52:38,743 --> 01:52:41,830
We sent for Adele,
she now lives with us,

1315
01:52:42,507 --> 01:52:46,594
as beloved as if she
was our own dear daughter.

1316
01:52:45,751 --> 01:52:49,046
We are truly devoted,
my Edward and I.

1317
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:51,632
Our hearts beat as one.

1318
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:54,260
Our happiness is complete.
