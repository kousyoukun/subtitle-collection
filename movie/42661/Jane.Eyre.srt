1
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,795
My parents died when
I was very young.

2
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,960
I was sent to live with my aunt,

3
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,035
Mrs. Reed and had
children at Gates at Hall.

4
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,075
Nearly 10 years I endured
their unkindness and cruelty.

5
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,835
They did not love me,
I could not love them.

6
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:11,195
You'll stay there till morning.
Aunt, no, I cannot endure it.

7
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:13,635
You'll do as you are told.

8
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,162
The Reverend Mr. Brocklehurst
is here, Madame.

9
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,023
John.

10
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,883
Good afternoon,
Mr. Brocklehurst.

11
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,083
Mrs. Reed.

12
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:08,883
Do come this way.

13
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:16,163
My children.

14
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:18,603
Enchanting.

15
00:04:20,123 --> 00:04:24,683
Tea?
Perhaps just this once.

16
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:31,043
Pray, be seated.

17
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:33,163
John, dear,

18
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,083
would you go and find that

19
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:36,803
wretched girl?

20
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:37,923
Yes, mama.

21
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:40,683
This has been a very

22
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,003
difficult decision, Mr. Brocklehurst.

23
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,643
Come on!
She s going!

24
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:48,323
Hooray! She'll never like it.
I can t believe it.

25
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:49,803
Her mother...

26
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:53,203
was my late husband's sister.

27
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:57,283
She married a clergyman,
penniless.

28
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,363
Then both parents died

29
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:02,403
of typhus when she was
a fewmonths old.

30
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:04,203
Are you her only relative?

31
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:05,923
There is...

32
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:07,563
an uncle.

33
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:09,883
Her father's brother.

34
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:12,123
But he lives abroad in...

35
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,523
Madeira,
I know nothing of him.

36
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,723
Go on.

37
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,067
I have done what I can

38
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:22,507
for the child,

39
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:23,827
but she has a

40
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,787
willful obstinate nature.

41
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:29,627
Ah, here she is.

42
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:33,507
This is Jane Eyre.

43
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,667
Jane, This is Mr. Brocklehurst
of Lowood School.

44
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:40,587
How do you do, sir?

45
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,027
I hear you are a wicked child,
Jane Eyre.

46
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,147
Let me examine you.

47
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:56,467
Do you know where
the wicked go after death?

48
00:05:58,547 --> 00:05:59,307
To Hell.

49
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,187
What is Hell?

50
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,787
Can you tell me that?

51
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:07,507
A pit full of fire.

52
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:11,667
And should you like to fall
into that pit

53
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:13,867
and to burn there forever?

54
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,827
No, sir.

55
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:17,467
What must you do

56
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:18,867
to avoid it?

57
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,347
Keep well and not die.

58
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:25,507
It is as I said.

59
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:28,307
You must warn her teachers

60
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:30,507
to keep an eye on her,

61
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:34,267
and to guard
against her worst fault,

62
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,987
her tendency to deceit.

63
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,507
Deceit?

64
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,427
We do not tolerate that
at Lowood.

65
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,387
That's why I wrote to you.

66
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,307
I want her to be
brought up in a manner

67
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:50,907
befitting her prospects.

68
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:53,027
To be made useful,

69
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,027
to be kept humble.

70
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,787
And... As for the vacations...

71
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:02,307
I would prefer...

72
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,707
if she spent them...

73
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:06,267
with you.

74
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:07,667
Of course.

75
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:11,227
Come.

76
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,787
Deceit is a sin.

77
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,147
It is akin to falsehood.

78
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:22,427
And all liars shall
spend eternity in that lake,

79
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,947
burning with
brimstone and fire.

80
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,747
- I'm not deceitful.
- I beg your pardon?

81
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:30,667
I'm not deceitful,

82
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,787
and I'm not a liar.

83
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,267
If I were,
I should say I loved you.

84
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,067
I do not love you,

85
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:42,107
I dislike you worst of anybody
in the world...

86
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:42,987
except your son.

87
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,827
Your bags, Jane Eyre.

88
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,187
Did you see

89
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:53,587
what a wicked child she is?

90
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:56,387
Have no fear, Mrs. Reed,

91
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,507
at Lowood we shall
tame her unruly spirit.

92
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:51,685
The stool.

93
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:55,685
Place this child upon it.

94
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,165
You see this...

95
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,285
this girl?

96
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,565
Her name is Jane Eyre.

97
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,805
Be on your guard
against her.

98
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:17,885
Avoid her company.

99
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:21,405
Shut her out
of your conversations.

100
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,125
This girl,
take a good look at her,

101
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,005
this girl is a liar.

102
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,445
Let her stand on this stool all day.

103
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:33,165
She shall have no food.

104
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:36,845
And let no one speak to her.

105
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:44,982
Alice.

106
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:46,841
Pay attention.

107
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,528
Back to your lessons.

108
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:23,582
Let her sing with us.

109
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,125
Jane.

110
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:07,885
What?

111
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,645
Some bread and cheese.

112
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,325
Thank you.

113
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:22,885
What is your name?

114
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:24,885
Helen Burns.

115
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,805
Thank you, Helen.
God bless you.

116
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,605
And you too, Jane.

117
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,405
Goodnight.

118
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,005
Hands...

119
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:02,605
Bonnet...

120
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,085
Shoes.

121
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:06,965
Hands.

122
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:08,565
Bonnet.

123
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:10,045
Bonnet, Jones!

124
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:14,725
Burns, you are on the side

125
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,085
of your shoes.
Your toes out immediately.

126
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:19,525
Your chin is poking out.

127
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:21,565
Your head up!

128
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:24,445
I will not have
you so slovenly.

129
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:26,805
Cover your mouth!

130
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,565
Dirty, disagreeable girl.

131
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,005
You haven't cleaned
your nails.

132
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:35,845
The water was frozen.

133
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,605
That is no excuse.

134
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:41,925
Fetch me the birch.

135
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,605
Obstinate girl.

136
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,285
Nothing will cure you

137
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,290
of your

138
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,205
slatternly habits.

139
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,245
Sorry, Miss Scatcherd.

140
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,565
Put it away.

141
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:02,805
Cleanliness...

142
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,325
is next to Godliness.

143
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,285
Time for your lessons.

144
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:18,365
You destroyed our day now!
No one likes you.

145
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,845
Go sit down,
I'll see you in a minute.

146
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,125
Who taught you to draw?
I taught myself.

147
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,605
I used to look at
my Aunt s books

148
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,685
and copy the pictures.

149
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:43,325
- You draw very well.
- Not really.

150
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,925
You do. You have a gift.
You re lucky.

151
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,445
Helen.

152
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,685
- Can I draw a portrait of you?
- Me?

153
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:57,565
Yes.

154
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,365
Take off your bonnet,
you have pretty hair.

155
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:40,925
Who's that girl with red hair?

156
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,285
Burns, sir. Helen Burns.

157
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:56,005
Burns, step forward.

158
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,372
Vanity.

159
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:06,779
You see this vanity?

160
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:09,638
Long curled hair,
masses of red curls.

161
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:12,106
It is in defiance of our principle
of this school.

162
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:13,598
You know that as I do.

163
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,369
It was my fault, sir.

164
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:16,929
I told her to take it off.

165
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:20,535
I don't care about a bonnet.
It's her hair, her vanity.

166
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,273
It's not vanity, Mr. Brocklehurst.
Helen's hair curls naturally.

167
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,310
And does she not sin
naturally as well?

168
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:31,002
I'm hear teach you discipline.

169
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,019
I am here to correct nature,
so are you Miss Temple.

170
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,630
Let me try to arrange hair so
it doesn't offend you.

171
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,911
Offending me is not the issue.
It is the child's

172
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,431
vanity must be suppressed.

173
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,099
Remove far from me

174
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:46,798
vanity and lies.

175
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,375
Proverbs.
Chapter 30, verse 8.

176
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,709
- The girl's hair shall be cut off.
- No!

177
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:58,685
Did someone speak?

178
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,725
You'd punish her for the way
God made her?

179
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:06,448
Fetch the scissors.

180
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:10,251
You, Jane Eyre.

181
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,063
Did you hear what I've said?

182
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,365
I will not ask you again.

183
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,925
Your hair will
grow again soon.

184
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:23,405
And if it is cut again,
it will grow again.

185
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,685
And it will be
more beautiful than before.

186
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,165
Come, into bed.

187
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:46,045
I'm sure you feel
very sorry for yourselves.

188
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:49,485
I'm sure you all

189
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:53,285
envy other girls who seem
to be blessed with happier lives.

190
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:55,685
But you...

191
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,925
have all been blessed
with intelligence.

192
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,405
Intelligence
and a proper education

193
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:06,725
will give you independence
of spirit,

194
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,805
and that is
the greatest blessing of all.

195
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,725
The only thing that matters
in your life

196
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:15,245
is to be in harmony
with God.

197
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:18,125
- What is this?
- Come, into bed.

198
00:18:19,045 --> 00:18:19,925
Go to bed!

199
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,125
Immediately!
All of you!

200
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:23,285
Miss Temple!

201
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,365
I'm worried about Helen Burns.

202
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:36,885
- Her cough is much worse.
- Most of girls have a cough.

203
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:39,085
I think we should call the doctor.

204
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,685
Only Mr. Brocklehurst
can do that.

205
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:46,525
Then I shall talk with him.

206
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,685
No, Miss Temple.
I will.

207
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:15,085
Helen?

208
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:18,459
Jane?

209
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,579
Is that you?

210
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:27,379
What are you doing here?

211
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,139
It's gone eleven.

212
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,417
I couldnt sleep
till I'd seen you.

213
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,306
Your feet are bare.

214
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:39,826
Lie down.

215
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,346
Cover yourself
with my quilt.

216
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,506
Don't cry.

217
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,066
You mustn't cry.

218
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,546
Please don't leave me.

219
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,346
We'll be together again.

220
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,246
When?

221
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:11,146
Where?

222
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:13,546
Be together

223
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:14,946
in Heaven...

224
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,226
forever, and always.

225
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:17,986
Will we?

226
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:22,746
Don't you believe that?
I dont know.

227
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:29,386
You must believe it, Jane.
You must believe...

228
00:21:29,786 --> 00:21:31,866
God will take care of us.

229
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,626
Goodnight,

230
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:39,466
dearest Jane.

231
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:20,146
Helen!

232
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:22,426
Mr. Brocklehurst.

233
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,546
Mr. Brocklehurst.

234
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:27,506
I've found her, sir.

235
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:34,251
Burns.

236
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,599
Burns.

237
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:47,607
I'll tend to it, sir.

238
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,739
Don't grieve, Jane.

239
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,387
She's gone to a better place.

240
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,018
May God have mercy
on her soul.

241
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,466
Come, Jane.

242
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:11,942
You must hurry, Jane.
The coach is here.

243
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,906
I hope you don't think
I'm being ungrateful.

244
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:25,146
Ungrateful,
what do you mean?

245
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,986
Ever since I've come to Lowood,
you've been my true friend,

246
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:30,386
apart from Helen.

247
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:33,426
- I feel I'm abandoning you.
- No, no.

248
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:35,866
You mustn't think that.

249
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,026
No. It's good

250
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:40,986
and proper for you
to start a new life.

251
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:44,026
I wish you could come.

252
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:45,626
Thank you.

253
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:49,546
But...

254
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,586
I believe it is God's will
I'm here.

255
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:54,866
I cannot leave.

256
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:04,906
God bless you.

257
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:20,767
How much further?

258
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,206
If Miss Eyre,

259
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:33,886
who advertised in the Yorkshire
Herald last Thursday,

260
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,806
is in a position to give

261
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,646
satisfactory references

262
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,406
as to character
and competency,

263
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,246
a situation can be
offered to her.

264
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:44,606
There is but one pupil,

265
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,526
a little girl
under ten years of age.

266
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,726
The salary is 30 pounds
per annum.

267
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:52,886
Miss Eyre is requested

268
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:56,446
to send references, name,
address

269
00:25:56,646 --> 00:26:00,566
and all particulars
to Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall.

270
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,366
- Goodbye, Miss.
- Goodbye.

271
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:18,766
Goodbye, young lass.

272
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,006
Come in, Miss.

273
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:49,486
Come in.

274
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:53,686
Leah!

275
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:56,046
It's the new Governess.

276
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:12,475
Would you follow me, Miss?

277
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,435
Mrs. Fairfax.

278
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:21,675
Mrs. Fairfax.

279
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:23,035
Miss Eyre.

280
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:28,155
How do you do, my dear?

281
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:31,635
I'm afraid you've had a tedious journey.
You must be frozen.

282
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:32,915
Let me help you.

283
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,275
- Don't trouble yourself.
- No trouble.

284
00:27:36,675 --> 00:27:40,395
Your hands must be numb with cold.
Come to the fire

285
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:41,995
and get warm.

286
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:43,795
There.
And I dare say

287
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,955
a hot drink would be
most welcome too.

288
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:48,355
- Sugar?
- No, thank you.

289
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:50,275
Leah, cut a sandwich or two.

290
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,567
- Do sit down my dear.
- Thank you.

291
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:53,567
The key.

292
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:56,247
- What?
- The key, Mrs. Fairfax.

293
00:27:58,827 --> 00:27:59,587
Here.

294
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:03,027
If Adele is still awake,
ask her to come down.

295
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:04,587
Yes, Mrs. Fairfax.

296
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:09,021
The child keeps
the most impossible hours.

297
00:28:09,381 --> 00:28:10,461
Her mother

298
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:13,421
must have kept her up
the entire evening.

299
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:14,781
She isn't your daughter?

300
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:17,701
Oh, no, no.

301
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:20,621
No, her name is Varens...
Adele Varens.

302
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:22,621
No, I have no family.

303
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:29,181
I am glad, I'm so glad

304
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:30,541
you are come.

305
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,861
One can feel so isolated here,
especially in the winter.

306
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:39,661
It will be most pleasant for me
to have someone to converse with

307
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,501
on terms of equality.

308
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,901
Of course to be sure,

309
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:48,181
John and his wife Leah
are very decent people...

310
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:51,221
Here is your charge.

311
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:52,941
Come, Adele.

312
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:56,021
This lady will teach you

313
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:58,421
and make a clever woman
of you.

314
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:00,941
My governess?

315
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:04,061
That's right.
You may call me Miss Eyre.

316
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,941
You speak French!
May we speak in French?

317
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:10,301
Yes, Adele, but we're
with Mrs. Fairfax now,

318
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,381
and in her presence
it is more polite,

319
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,901
if we try to speak in English.

320
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:14,941
You understand

321
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,581
when she runs on like that?

322
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,421
Oh yes.

323
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:20,301
Shall I sing?
My mama taught me to sing.

324
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,621
Where is your mama?

325
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:24,141
Gone. She flew away

326
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:25,701
to the Holy Virgin.

327
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,701
She taught me
to dance and sing.

328
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,461
Shall I sing for you, now?

329
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,221
In the morning, Adele.

330
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:32,541
It's late.

331
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:36,021
And it is time you were in bed.
Come along.

332
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:40,541
We shall come up
and hear your prayers.

333
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:43,461
This way, my dear.

334
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:49,261
Come on, Miss.

335
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:54,781
Thornfield is a fine old hall,
perhaps a little neglected,

336
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,421
but that could be remedied
if Mr. Rochester would come home.

337
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,261
Who is Mr. Rochester?

338
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,666
Why, he is the Master
of this house.

339
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,421
But you will never see him.
He never stops here.

340
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:09,301
Of course he does,
sometimes.

341
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,741
He brought you here,
didn't he?

342
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,221
But it is true,
he is usually away.

343
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:19,021
Will we be very happy?

344
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:23,181
We shall work hard
and be content.

345
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:28,061
- Goodnight, Adele. Say your prayers.
- Goodnight, Miss Eyre.

346
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:30,581
Goodnight, Mrs. Fairfax.

347
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:32,901
Goodnight, Adele.

348
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:39,461
I'll not keep you up all night.

349
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:42,061
I'm sure you'll want
to retire early.

350
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,981
And your room is just along here
near to Adele.

351
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:49,141
It is small, but I thought
you'd like it better

352
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:50,941
than the ones in front.

353
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:55,461
They're larger, but so solitary.
No one ever sleeps there.

354
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:57,901
One would almost say

355
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:01,981
if there was a ghost at Thornfield,
that would be its haunt.

356
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,061
Now, here is your room.

357
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:13,621
This is for me?

358
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:16,421
Why, is anything the matter?

359
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:19,781
Tomorrow I'll discover
this is a dream

360
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,661
from which I must awaken.

361
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:26,221
We are real,

362
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:30,141
and you are most welcome here,
most welcome.

363
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:33,901
Goodnight my dear. Sleep well.
Thank you, Mrs. Fairfax.

364
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:54,941
Up here

365
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:57,101
is the main gallery.

366
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,101
What a handsome place.

367
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:04,461
I had the windows opened
to let in the air.

368
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:05,421
Everything gets

369
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:08,461
so damp in rooms
that are seldom entered.

370
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,741
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

371
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,781
Here are the Master's rooms.

372
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:34,901
Is that Mr. Rochester?

373
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:36,181
Oh, no.

374
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:38,021
His father.

375
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:41,781
Why Mr. Rochester keeps it
here despite everything,

376
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,781
I do not know.
One of his strange ways.

377
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:49,781
His father and his brother

378
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:53,061
were very unfair to him.

379
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:56,941
Some would say barbarous.

380
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:00,021
He was the youngest son,
you see.

381
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,781
And he was expected

382
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,741
to sacrifice everything
for the family.

383
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:11,901
He only inherited Thornfield
nine years ago.

384
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:21,781
When he was a child,
he was a gentle boy.

385
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:25,981
He's clearly not barbarous
if he s taking care of Adele.

386
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,381
Oh, no.

387
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:31,341
No, Mr. Rochester does accept
his responsibilities.

388
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:35,621
He's a just and liberal
landlord to his tenants.

389
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:38,301
He's well travelled

390
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,421
and very intelligent.

391
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:44,141
But when he talks to you,
you can't be sure

392
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:46,621
whether he is in jest
or in earnest.

393
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:50,301
Whether he is pleased
or the contrary.

394
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,381
He is not a happy man.

395
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,901
Oh my goodness, those flowers!

396
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:05,981
I keep telling Leah that all the
rooms must be kept in readiness.

397
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:08,781
Mr. Rochester's visits
may be rare,

398
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:10,621
but we are never warned.

399
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:30,981
What was that?

400
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:35,981
One of the servants most likely,
Grace Poole.

401
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:37,141
Did you hear it?

402
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:38,461
Oh, yes.

403
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:41,221
I often hear it.

404
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,901
She does sewing in
one of these rooms.

405
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,061
Grace!

406
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,221
Too much noise!

407
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:56,741
Remember instructions.

408
00:35:01,421 --> 00:35:02,661
We can go back this way.

409
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:43,061
Your arithmetic
is not very good, Adele.

410
00:35:43,301 --> 00:35:45,821
It s dull.
I don t care for it.

411
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,546
Why can't we do something else?

412
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:50,981
It's my job to give
you a good education.

413
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,261
Arithmetic is
an important part of that.

414
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:57,901
Mama said it was important
to sing and dance.

415
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,101
That wasn't dull.

416
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:03,021
If you re good,
I'll teach you the piano.

417
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:04,421
Will you?

418
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,981
- When?
- Perhaps tomorrow.

419
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:10,941
- Why not now?
- Arithmetic today, piano tomorrow.

420
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,981
I'm going for a walk,
and when I come back,

421
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:18,621
I want to see how many
of those sums

422
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:20,621
you have got right.

423
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:26,581
- But they're so difficult.
- You can do it, I know you can.

424
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
Are you injured, sir?

425
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:50,381
Can I do anything?

426
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,741
You can stand to my side.

427
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:08,381
If you're hurt,
I can fetch some help.

428
00:38:08,981 --> 00:38:11,741
Thank you. I shall do.
I have no broken bones.

429
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:17,181
Go on then.

430
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,626
I cannot think of leaving you here, sir.

431
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:23,061
Until I see you are able
to mount your horse.

432
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:25,261
You should be at home yourself.

433
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:27,821
Where do you come from?

434
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:29,261
There.

435
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:32,581
That house
with the battlements?

436
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,061
Yes, sir.

437
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,021
Whose house is it?

438
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,541
Mr. Rochester's.

439
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,741
Do you know Mr. Rochester?

440
00:38:45,261 --> 00:38:46,741
I have never seen him.

441
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,701
What is your position there?

442
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,701
I'm the Governess.

443
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,501
Aah, the Governess.

444
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:00,581
I believe I must ask
your help after all.

445
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:01,861
If you'll be so kind. Yes sir.

446
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:04,701
Would you get hold
of my horse's bridle

447
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:06,061
and lead him to me?

448
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:09,941
You are not afraid?

449
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,061
No, sir.

450
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,061
The mountain will
never come to Mahomet,

451
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,341
so help Mahomet
go to the mountain.

452
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:30,981
Would you come here?

453
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,101
Excuse me.

454
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:38,621
Necessity compels me
to make use of you.

455
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:01,221
Thank you.
Would you hand me my hat?

456
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:02,501
And crop.

457
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:09,821
Thank you for your help.

458
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:13,941
Now...

459
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,741
make haste home as fast

460
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:21,461
as you can.

461
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:37,861
Whose dog is this?

462
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:39,421
He came with the Master.

463
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:41,821
With whom?
The Master.

464
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:43,381
Mr. Rochester.

465
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:44,581
He just arrived.

466
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,461
Here is Miss Eyre, sir.

467
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:04,941
I trust the leg more comfortable?

468
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:06,781
Doctor will be here
in the morning.

469
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:10,061
Let Miss Eyre be seated.

470
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,581
Look what Mr. Rochester
has brought me.

471
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:21,261
Have you brought
Mademoiselle a present?

472
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,341
Did you expect a present?
Are you...

473
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:28,701
fond of presents?

474
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:31,181
I hardly know, sir.

475
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:33,301
I have little experience
of them.

476
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:34,941
They are thought pleasant.

477
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,541
Generally thought so,

478
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:39,741
but what do you think?

479
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,741
A present has many faces,
has it not?

480
00:41:44,621 --> 00:41:46,981
How long have you been
in my house?

481
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,301
Four months.

482
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,061
And you came from?

483
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:52,101
Lowood School, Lancashire.

484
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:53,821
Lowood!

485
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:56,621
How long were you there?

486
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,021
Ten years.

487
00:41:58,381 --> 00:41:59,461
Eight as a pupil,

488
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:01,061
two as a teacher.

489
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:05,181
You must be tenacious to have
survived that place so long.

490
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:09,021
You have
the look of another world.

491
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:13,341
When I saw you, I thought
of fairy tales and almost asked

492
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,341
if you'd bewitched my horse.

493
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:19,101
I'm not sure yet,
it is she

494
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:21,141
 who is responsible
for my sprain.

495
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:24,341
There was ice on the road.
It caused your horse

496
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:25,541
to slip.

497
00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:27,701
Perhaps.

498
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:30,221
I'm not sure yet.

499
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:35,181
Very well, Miss Eyre.

500
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:38,821
I bid you good night.

501
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:55,621
Adele.

502
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,581
Watch and listen.

503
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:02,901
You mean like this?

504
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:10,261
I have examined Adele.

505
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:14,021
You have taken great
pains with her.

506
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:18,661
She's not bright,
she's no particular talent,

507
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:21,141
yet she's made
much improvement.

508
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:23,941
- She's worked hard.
- You are teaching her piano?

509
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,261
- Yes, sir.
- Are you fond of music?

510
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:27,501
Do you play well?

511
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:28,981
I'm very fond of music.

512
00:43:29,261 --> 00:43:30,261
I play a little.

513
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,541
Like any other
English schoolgirl.

514
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:35,781
Perhaps better than some,
but not...

515
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:36,741
well.

516
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:40,101
Adele showed me some sketches.

517
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:44,621
She said they were yours.

518
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:49,101
I don t know if they
were of your doing...

519
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:52,101
Perhaps some master helped you?

520
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,621
No one helped me, sir.

521
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:56,261
That wounds your pride.

522
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:02,906
These pictures must have taken
much time.

523
00:44:05,261 --> 00:44:06,341
When did you do them?

524
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,621
In the last two vacations
I spend to Lowell.

525
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,061
Did you copy them?

526
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:11,901
They came out of my head.

527
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:14,741
That head I see now
on your shoulders?

528
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:16,621
Yes, sir.

529
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:22,061
Has it other furniture
of the same kind within?

530
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:23,781
I think it may have.

531
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:25,261
Better, I hope.

532
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,421
Were you happy
when you painted them?

533
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:37,021
I couldn't paint what was
in my imagination.

534
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:39,621
I always wanted to achieve more.

535
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:44,581
You may have
insufficient technique...

536
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:51,461
but the thoughts are magical.

537
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:55,461
Ah, nine o'clock.

538
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,741
- Is Adele in bed?
- Not yet, sir.

539
00:44:58,941 --> 00:45:02,661
She should be in bed.
I don't approve of these late hours.

540
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:04,901
See to it, Miss Eyre.

541
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:17,941
I would do the edges darker.

542
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:26,661
His leg is better.

543
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,981
He will be going away soon.

544
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,341
Perhaps.

545
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:34,221
It will break my heart.

546
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:37,221
It's this one here.

547
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:42,661
Could you draw me a picture of him?

548
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:44,741
To always have him with me.

549
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,181
You examined me,
Miss Eyre.

550
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:28,381
Do you think me handsome?

551
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:30,301
No, sir.

552
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:34,981
There is something singular
about you. The air of a little nun,

553
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:36,906
quaint, quiet, grave and simple.

554
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:39,061
But when asked a
question,

555
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:43,101
 or makes a remark to which you are
obliged to answer, you rap out a reply

556
00:46:43,341 --> 00:46:46,141
which is at least brusque.
What do you mean by it?

557
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,621
Sir, I was too plain.
I beg your pardon.

558
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:51,581
I should have replied
that tastes differ.

559
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:55,861
That beauty is of little consequence.
Something about that sort.

560
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,661
You will endure my surliness
without being hurt.

561
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:06,861
Very few masters would trouble
themselves to enquire, wheater or not

562
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:09,261
if their employees
were offended.

563
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:12,341
You never laugh, Miss Eyre?

564
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:15,101
Never mind.

565
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:19,621
Let me see what my paid employee
has been drawing in her sketch book.

566
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:25,661
May I?

567
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:42,021
You have me utterly.

568
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:47,781
No, no, it's mine.

569
00:47:58,621 --> 00:47:59,661
Come with me, Miss Eyre.

570
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:04,981
Adele, continue with your work.
And remember...

571
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:07,981
shadows are as important
as light.

572
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:17,501
Do you believe that?
What, sir?

573
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:22,421
That shadows are as
important as light?

574
00:48:23,661 --> 00:48:25,901
I believe none of us is perfect,

575
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:27,541
I believe none of us is
without some fault to hide.

576
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:39,141
You are not naturally austere
any more than I'm naturally vicious.

577
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:45,661
I once had a heart
full of tender feelings.

578
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,781
But fortune has knocked
me about.

579
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:55,661
Now I'm as hard and tough
as an India rubber ball.

580
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:08,141
You think there is
there any hope for me?

581
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:09,621
Hope for what, sir?

582
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:13,941
My being transformed from India rubber
back to flesh and blood.

583
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:18,941
Come, Pilot.

584
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,821
Is all well, my dear?

585
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:40,981
What a strange man!

586
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:43,941
So changeful and abrupt.

587
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,261
I suppose I ve grown
accustomed to it.

588
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:51,781
- And one has to make allowances.
- Why?

589
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:55,301
Partly because it s his nature,

590
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,821
and none of us
can help our nature.

591
00:49:58,381 --> 00:50:01,061
Partly...
family troubles.

592
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:02,981
He doesn't have a family.

593
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:05,741
There are painful memories

594
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:08,261
which are perhaps
best forgotten.

595
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,181
Well done, Adele.

596
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:57,221
Is that how mama
danced for you?

597
00:51:00,381 --> 00:51:01,461
Precisely.

598
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:03,181
Exactly.

599
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:05,821
Now...

600
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:11,381
Off to bed.
Fairfax, take her out.

601
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:13,501
Oh no mesieur,
let me stay a while longer.

602
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:15,741
Let me dance again.
You heard me what I said.

603
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,621
Please!

604
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:17,826
Don't argue.

605
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:19,141
Do as you are told.

606
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,621
Come, Adele.

607
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:22,821
Come.

608
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:35,461
Well?

609
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:40,181
Treat me as you will,
but you should not treat a child thus.

610
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:42,941
I will treat her
however I see fit.

611
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:47,061
When I look at Adele,

612
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:49,701
I see a miniature
of her mother.

613
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:51,381
The same...

614
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:55,101
beauty,
the same merciless charm.

615
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:58,621
She was an opera dancer.

616
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:01,221
I was not the first
to love her,

617
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:04,341
but she told me that I...

618
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:06,581
was Adele's father.

619
00:52:08,221 --> 00:52:10,581
At the time I wanted
to believe that.

620
00:52:10,821 --> 00:52:15,021
But one night, I found her in
the arms of a brainless viscount.

621
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:18,141
I left a bullet
in his feeble wing,

622
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:21,781
gave her my purse
and ordered her away from me.

623
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:23,261
So...

624
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:25,901
perhaps you'll think
differently of the child.

625
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:29,661
Perhaps you'll soon be telling me
I should look for a new Governess.

626
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:32,541
Adele is not responsible
for her mother's faults.

627
00:52:32,741 --> 00:52:34,341
- Or yours.
- Or mine?

628
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:36,141
What have I done but play
the village idiot?

629
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:37,981
You've made Adele
feel unwanted and unloved.

630
00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:41,221
Why didn't she leave her in Paris,
where she was happy?

631
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:42,301
Because

632
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,341
her mother abandoned her.

633
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:49,541
When I looked around
I was all she had left.

634
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,141
And I do honor
my obligations.

635
00:52:57,181 --> 00:52:58,861
However they were incurred.

636
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,101
No one can deny me that.

637
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,421
Goodnight, Miss Eyre.

638
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,214
Mr. Rochester!

639
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:21,501
Mr. Rochester, wake up!

640
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:33,843
Wake up, sir, please!

641
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:43,459
Is there a flood?

642
00:54:46,393 --> 00:54:47,393
Come, Mister.

643
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:04,529
More water!

644
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:38,581
What happened?

645
00:55:39,221 --> 00:55:40,341
I don't know.

646
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,950
I heard a strange laugh.

647
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,218
Grace.

648
00:55:46,856 --> 00:55:47,936
Where are you going?

649
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,477
Stay here, don't move.

650
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:55,032
Wrap yourself in my cloak.

651
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,751
You re soaked.

652
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:16,501
Grace!

653
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:22,232
Open the door, Grace.

654
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:48,941
It was as I thought.

655
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,021
- Grace Poole, sir?
- Quiet so.

656
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:54,861
You should send her away.

657
00:56:56,221 --> 00:56:58,741
Say nothing of this business.

658
00:57:00,741 --> 00:57:01,821
I will answer for

659
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:02,981
all this.

660
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:10,061
You can go to your room,
There s nothing more to fear.

661
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:20,513
Goodnight then, sir.

662
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:22,571
What?

663
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:24,741
Are you leaving me?

664
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:26,941
You told me to go.

665
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:31,181
Not in that brief, dry fashion.
Not without...

666
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:34,621
taking leave.

667
00:57:35,221 --> 00:57:36,261
At least,

668
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,821
shake hands.

669
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:46,661
The roses had thorned.

670
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:56,138
You have saved my life.

671
00:58:00,536 --> 00:58:02,016
I am in your debt.

672
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:03,221
There is no debt,

673
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,901
no obligation.

674
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:09,321
I knew you'd do me good
at some time.

675
00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:11,861
I saw it in your eyes
when I first beheld you.

676
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:15,981
I'm glad I happened
to be awake.

677
00:58:20,907 --> 00:58:22,627
What's the matter?
You re shivering.

678
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,541
I'm cold.

679
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:29,821
Cold?

680
00:58:31,974 --> 00:58:33,054
You are cold?

681
00:58:33,736 --> 00:58:34,696
Yes, sir.

682
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:40,724
Go then, Jane.

683
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:43,003
Go back to bed.

684
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,056
You call that clean?

685
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:59,256
You and I are going
to have words downstairs.

686
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:07,176
Good morning, Miss Eyre.

687
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:09,216
What happened?

688
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:12,256
The Master was reading in bed
last night.

689
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:16,127
He feel asleep with a candle lit
and the curtains got on fire.

690
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:19,887
Luckily he woke up in time
to put the flames out.

691
00:59:20,087 --> 00:59:21,567
Here you are.
Hang them all.

692
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:23,367
Did nobody hear anything?

693
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:24,607
Did nobody wake up?

694
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,270
Perhaps you heard something?

695
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,807
Yes, Grace... I did.

696
00:59:30,727 --> 00:59:32,247
I heard someone laughing.

697
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,807
If I were you, Miss,

698
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:39,647
I'd get in the habit of bolting
my door when I went to bed at night.

699
00:59:44,887 --> 00:59:47,967
Leah, that's one, and two...

700
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:50,447
Good morning.

701
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,367
Oh, Miss Eyre!

702
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:54,727
I supose you've heard about
the master's accident?

703
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,847
It is a mercy he wasn't burnt

704
00:59:57,087 --> 00:59:58,927
in his bed. Leah!

705
00:59:59,727 --> 01:00:02,407
Is he all right?
Yea, well enough...

706
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:05,447
to be up for the sun and
gone before breakfast.

707
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:07,127
Gone? Gone where?

708
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:10,807
To Lord Ingram's,
the other side of Millcote.

709
01:00:11,047 --> 01:00:14,207
There's quite a party
assembled there. Pillows.

710
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:16,767
Do you expect him back tonight?

711
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:17,967
Oh, no.

712
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:20,327
Nor tomorrow night either.

713
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:24,647
When these fashionable people get
together, they are in no hurry.

714
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:28,087
They may go to London
or the Continent.

715
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:33,327
Mr. Rochester may not be back
for a year.

716
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:37,287
He's quite a favourite
with the ladies.

717
01:00:37,487 --> 01:00:38,407
Miss Blanche

718
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:40,047
has been at him for years.

719
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:41,647
Miss Blanche?

720
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,967
Lord Ingram's daughter.
Prettiest girl in the county.

721
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,247
She is, Miss.

722
01:00:46,687 --> 01:00:48,287
Does the Master like her?

723
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:50,407
Oh, yes!

724
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:54,927
He is a different man
when he is with her.

725
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:58,087
So merry and lively
you wouldn't know him.

726
01:00:58,887 --> 01:00:59,847
Ah, Leah.

727
01:01:18,402 --> 01:01:19,642
You are a fool.

728
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:27,847
I'll help you with this sheet.

729
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,847
Hurry.
They'll be coming soon.

730
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,927
James, hurry.
Take them to the dining room.

731
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:39,967
My corner to your corner.

732
01:01:42,127 --> 01:01:45,007
Ms. Fairfax, have you something
we can keep a frog in?

733
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,647
- A what?
- A frog.

734
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:49,327
My dear,
I have no time for frogs.

735
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,847
Mr. Rochester
may be here any minute

736
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:54,687
and all of Lord Ingram's friends
with him.

737
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:56,807
He's never done this before.

738
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,967
They'll bring their maids
and their valets.

739
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:03,207
In the past he couldn't wait
to leave Thornfield,

740
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:06,407
now it seems he's determined to fill
the house with guests.

741
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:13,854
- They are coming!
 - What?

742
01:02:19,214 --> 01:02:22,454
Mademoiselle,
the beautiful ladies are coming!

743
01:02:25,854 --> 01:02:26,854
Lady Ingram.

744
01:02:27,654 --> 01:02:29,294
And Lady Eshton.

745
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:31,654
Yes, and Lady Lynn.

746
01:02:34,654 --> 01:02:36,134
And that, of course,

747
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:37,854
is Miss Blanche.

748
01:02:41,454 --> 01:02:42,894
- This way.
- Thank you.

749
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:02,761
Do you think Mr. Rochester is in love
with Miss Ingram?

750
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:05,241
You shouldn't ask such a question.

751
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:06,761
Why not?

752
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,249
Because it's none of our affair.

753
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:10,841
It would be
if they got married.

754
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,761
Adele, stop this conversation.

755
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:15,041
Go back to your work.

756
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,481
I hope he doesn't marry her.

757
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:23,201
A maid told Leah she's only
interested in his money.

758
01:03:23,441 --> 01:03:24,961
She said he brought back a fortune

759
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,521
- from Jamaica.
- Adele!

760
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:37,681
Miss Eyre!

761
01:03:40,721 --> 01:03:44,081
Mr. Rochester wants you
to bring Adele to the party,

762
01:03:44,241 --> 01:03:45,561
and he wants you to stay

763
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,801
until it is her bedtime.

764
01:03:47,841 --> 01:03:49,441
Surely, he doesn't want me to stay?

765
01:03:49,481 --> 01:03:50,321
Oh, yes.

766
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,801
"If she objects, tell her

767
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,761
it is my particular wish."

768
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:57,401
Those were his very words.

769
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:32,961
Bon Soir Medame.

770
01:04:33,281 --> 01:04:34,281
Good evening.

771
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:36,041
What a little puppet!

772
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:38,281
That must be Mr. Rochester's ward.

773
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:40,601
The little French girl.

774
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:43,361
- What's your name, child?
- Adele, madame.

775
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:44,681
So pretty, how charming.

776
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:48,121
Edward, I thought
you were not fond of children.

777
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:49,721
Nor am I.

778
01:04:50,201 --> 01:04:52,881
What persuaded you to take
charge of this little creature?

779
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:55,561
Where did you pick her up?

780
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,801
I did not pick her up.
She was left on my hands.

781
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,361
You should send her
to school.

782
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:04,521
Not sure I could afford it,
schools are so expensive.

783
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,401
You look after her, yourself?

784
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:09,241
We have a Governess.

785
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:12,721
A Governess.
Yes, I thought I saw someone

786
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:14,321
with her just now.

787
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:16,769
You can tell a Governess
at first glance.

788
01:05:18,601 --> 01:05:19,601
They are plain,

789
01:05:19,921 --> 01:05:21,441
in a very special way.

790
01:05:22,281 --> 01:05:23,241
Aren't they, Mama?

791
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:25,321
Aren't to what, my darling?

792
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:26,401
Governesses.

793
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:28,601
Don't talk to me
about Governesses.

794
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:31,641
The very word makes me
tremble with rage.

795
01:05:31,881 --> 01:05:34,081
I have suffered a martyrdom

796
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:35,761
in their incompetence.

797
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:38,761
What?

798
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:40,006
Nothing.

799
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:41,241
Have I said something wrong?

800
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:44,521
She is sitting just
behind you.

801
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,521
Who is?

802
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:47,561
The Governess.

803
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:51,001
Never mind.
It may do her

804
01:05:51,241 --> 01:05:53,321
good to hear the truth.

805
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:56,033
Come along...

806
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,761
time for dancing.
I have been idle long enough.

807
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:00,961
Bianca, will you do me

808
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:02,081
the great honour?

809
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:04,801
I didn't know you were a dancing man.

810
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:06,541
He only dances with me.

811
01:06:07,023 --> 01:06:08,643
Who else would I want to dance with?

812
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:10,541
Mrs. Bennet, will you play for us?

813
01:06:56,401 --> 01:07:01,121
Jane!
You look pale.

814
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:04,541
- Was my dancing so clumsy?
- No, sir.

815
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:07,801
Come back to the drawing room,
it is too early to go to bed.

816
01:07:08,281 --> 01:07:09,601
I'm tired, sir.

817
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:11,601
And a little depressed.

818
01:07:14,734 --> 01:07:15,734
What about?
Tell me!

819
01:07:16,628 --> 01:07:20,308
- Nothing, sir. I'm not depressed.
- But you are.

820
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:25,701
A few more words would bring
tears to your eyes.

821
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,160
- Did I see them there now?
- Excuse me, sir.

822
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,549
- I'm very tired.
- Very well.

823
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,740
I'll excuse you tonight,

824
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:33,843
but so long as my visitors stay,

825
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,360
I would like you to appear
in the drawing room every evening.

826
01:07:39,427 --> 01:07:42,027
It is my wish, Jane,
don't ignore it.

827
01:07:58,121 --> 01:07:59,481
May I help you, sir?

828
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:01,361
I...

829
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:04,241
I'd like to see Mr. Rochester.

830
01:08:04,801 --> 01:08:06,361
We have a house full of guests.

831
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:09,201
Mr. Rochester and I, are old...

832
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:14,481
old friends,
and I am very tired.

833
01:08:15,241 --> 01:08:18,801
I have come a long way to see him.
All the way from Jamaica.

834
01:08:27,881 --> 01:08:29,281
May I have your name, sir?

835
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,161
Mason...

836
01:08:31,601 --> 01:08:32,841
Richard Mason.

837
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:35,561
Peter.

838
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:40,201
Take this gentleman
to the tapestry bedroom.

839
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:54,841
Damn your luck, Dent!

840
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:01,441
Anything else, sir?

841
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:04,001
No, thank you.

842
01:10:02,601 --> 01:10:07,481
Jane,
I need your help.

843
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:08,801
What is it?

844
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:12,401
Come with me.

845
01:10:16,681 --> 01:10:19,201
You don't turn sick
at the sight of blood?

846
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:21,521
I don't think so.

847
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:23,681
Give me your hand.

848
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,241
It won't do to risk
your fainting.

849
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:34,761
Here, Jane.

850
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:37,721
There's a sponge
on the washstand.

851
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:39,761
Try to stop the bleeding.

852
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:42,561
I'll fetch the doctor.
I won't be long.

853
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:24,521
I'll give you half an hour

854
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:27,761
to dress his wound
and get him out.

855
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,281
Why did you come,
why, why on earth?

856
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:37,001
I thought
I could do some good.

857
01:11:37,241 --> 01:11:38,281
You thought.

858
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:41,161
You thought!

859
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,201
She said shed

860
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:45,681
drain my heart.

861
01:11:47,321 --> 01:11:51,201
Keep him at your house until he's quite
well. I'll ride over in a day or two.

862
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:56,841
Have pity on her.

863
01:11:57,606 --> 01:11:58,726
Let her be treated tenderly.

864
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:01,241
- Let her be...
- Yes.

865
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:02,881
I do my best.

866
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:05,561
And will continue to do so.

867
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:10,561
- It is not her fault.
- I know that.

868
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:12,761
If anyone's to blame,
it's you.

869
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:14,561
Go.

870
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:26,441
Ace of spades.

871
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:28,721
You have the devil's own luck
Rochester.

872
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:32,161
You know what they say.
Lucky in cards, unlucky in love.

873
01:12:32,188 --> 01:12:34,548
Penny, off you go
with the other guests.

874
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:37,601
I'm bored with this game.

875
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:40,721
Why don't we play
something else?

876
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:43,361
What would you like to play?

877
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:47,881
Lord Brancaster has a billiard
table. You shoud buy one.

878
01:12:48,081 --> 01:12:49,081
I adore billiards.

879
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:51,081
They are rather expensive.

880
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:52,841
I'm not sure
I could afford one.

881
01:12:55,401 --> 01:12:57,321
Does that person want you?

882
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:05,681
Is something wrong?

883
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,041
May I speak to you, sir?

884
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:08,841
7 card whist?

885
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:14,246
What is it?

886
01:13:14,841 --> 01:13:16,881
I received a letter
this morning.

887
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:19,281
Please sir,
I wan't leave of absence.

888
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:20,201
Why?

889
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:24,601
- An old lady who is sick.
- What old lady?

890
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:27,391
Her name is Mrs. Reed.
She's my aunt.

891
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:31,401
- I thought you had no relatives.
- None that would own me.

892
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:33,731
Mrs. Reed cast me off
when I was a child.

893
01:13:33,996 --> 01:13:36,876
- Then why go off to see her?
- She's dying.

894
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:39,521
I can't ignore her dying wish.

895
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:43,281
You won't be
persuaded to stay?

896
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:45,441
No, sir.

897
01:13:46,281 --> 01:13:48,161
I will return to Thornfield.

898
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:53,041
So you and I must say goodbye.

899
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:55,081
Yes, sir.

900
01:13:58,161 --> 01:14:00,961
How does one perform that ceremony?
Teach me.

901
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:05,001
They say farewell.
Or any form they prefer.

902
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:09,801
Farewell, Miss Eyre.

903
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:15,361
For the present.

904
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:19,041
Is that all?

905
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:20,601
Yes, sir.

906
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:24,441
Why don't we shake hands?

907
01:14:34,443 --> 01:14:35,843
Remember your promise.

908
01:15:13,401 --> 01:15:14,481
Mr. Rivers?

909
01:15:14,841 --> 01:15:16,121
Miss Eyre is here.

910
01:15:17,361 --> 01:15:18,361
Miss Eyre.

911
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:22,241
St. John Rivers, Rector of
Gateshead. How do you do?

912
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:23,481
Please come in.

913
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:26,681
Your aunt is most anxious
to see you.

914
01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:28,521
Your family is in trouble.

915
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:32,321
John Reed, your cousin,
died last month in London.

916
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:33,681
He died. How?

917
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:36,641
They say, he ruined his health
with bad company.

918
01:15:37,281 --> 01:15:39,401
It was his death that brought on
your aunt's illness.

919
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:41,281
This is, my sister, Mary.

920
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:44,961
Mary, I'm taking her to see her aunt.

921
01:15:45,201 --> 01:15:46,641
I should be back presently.

922
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:08,561
You are like...

923
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,401
Why, you are like...

924
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:16,521
Jane Eyre.

925
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:18,521
I am Jane Eyre.

926
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:23,281
I am very ill.

927
01:16:29,641 --> 01:16:31,961
My mind is much troubled

928
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:35,361
by two wrongs
I have done you.

929
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:37,801
One...

930
01:16:38,721 --> 01:16:42,361
was breaking my promise
to my husband...

931
01:16:43,081 --> 01:16:44,401
to bring you up as

932
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,241
one of my own.

933
01:16:46,921 --> 01:16:47,921
The other...

934
01:16:48,961 --> 01:16:51,241
Go to my writing case.

935
01:16:53,521 --> 01:16:55,641
Take out the letter
you'll find there.

936
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:13,599
Read the letter.

937
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:27,921
"Madame, will you have the goodness
to send me the address of my niece,

938
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:29,161
"Jane Eyre,

939
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:31,321
"and to tell me how she is.

940
01:17:32,201 --> 01:17:36,521
"It is my intention to ask her
to come to me at Madeira.

941
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:40,555
"As I am unmarried
and childless...

942
01:17:40,653 --> 01:17:43,213
"I wish to adopt her
during my life...

943
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:45,696
"and bequeath her at my death...

944
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:47,858
"whatever I may
have to leave."

945
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,400
This is dated 3 years ago.

946
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:56,681
Why did he never write to me?

947
01:17:59,231 --> 01:18:00,831
I wrote to him...

948
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,840
I told him I knew
nothing about you.

949
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:13,816
Now, act as you please.

950
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:17,241
Write to him...

951
01:18:19,095 --> 01:18:20,415
tell him I lied.

952
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:27,961
You were born to be
my torment.

953
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:32,201
I am not vindictive.

954
01:18:33,281 --> 01:18:34,921
Let us be friends.

955
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:44,281
Love me or hate me as you will.

956
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:48,161
You have my full
and free forgiveness.

957
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,881
I wish she would come back.

958
01:19:32,427 --> 01:19:33,387
Mademoiselle!

959
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:36,764
I thought you'd left for good.
I told you I'd come back.

960
01:19:37,241 --> 01:19:39,721
You said a week.
It's almost a month.

961
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,081
Forgive me, Adele.

962
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:43,861
Mr. Rochester
is sending me to a school.

963
01:19:44,557 --> 01:19:46,117
I was afraid I would be gone

964
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,610
- and never see you again.
- To school?

965
01:19:48,761 --> 01:19:49,801
To Paris.

966
01:19:49,841 --> 01:19:51,441
A school for young ladies.

967
01:19:54,841 --> 01:19:55,601
Adele.

968
01:19:57,601 --> 01:20:00,081
Go, tell cook
Miss Eyre has returned.

969
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:02,441
Another place at dinner.

970
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:05,721
I'll ask her
to make a special cake.

971
01:20:14,521 --> 01:20:16,161
So, you came back after all?

972
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:17,721
As I promised.

973
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,001
As you promised.

974
01:20:45,269 --> 01:20:47,189
You are very quiet
this evening.

975
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:53,761
What's on your mind?

976
01:20:54,257 --> 01:20:55,497
Many things, sir.

977
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,201
My aunt's death.

978
01:20:57,641 --> 01:20:59,481
Being back at Thornfield.

979
01:21:00,561 --> 01:21:01,481
And?

980
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:06,721
Adele tells me you are sending
her away to school.

981
01:21:07,001 --> 01:21:07,721
Yes.

982
01:21:09,881 --> 01:21:13,481
It's a good idea, don't you think?
Paris is her home after all.

983
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:16,801
May I ask why, sir?

984
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:20,001
I thought you might
have guessed.

985
01:21:22,683 --> 01:21:23,648
Perhaps...

986
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:25,921
because you're
going to be married.

987
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:29,876
Exactly.

988
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:32,159
Precisely.

989
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:37,241
With your usual acuteness,
you have hit the nails on the head.

990
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:40,081
I am to be married.

991
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:45,521
Which means Adele
will go to a school.

992
01:21:47,721 --> 01:21:49,481
And you'll need to find another situation.

993
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:53,881
- I will advertise directly...
- No, you will not.

994
01:21:53,921 --> 01:21:55,881
I have heard of a position
that might suit you.

995
01:21:56,601 --> 01:21:58,121
Governess to 5 daughters

996
01:21:58,361 --> 01:21:59,921
of a family in Ireland.

997
01:22:00,401 --> 01:22:01,881
It is a long way off.

998
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,141
No matter a girl of your sense
won't object to the voyage.

999
01:22:06,219 --> 01:22:07,539
Not the voyage,
but the distance...

1000
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:09,268
And the sea is such a barrier.

1001
01:22:11,561 --> 01:22:13,361
From what, Jane?

1002
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:15,361
From England, sir.

1003
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:17,921
And from Thornfield.

1004
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:20,201
And...

1005
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:28,641
Sometimes I have the strangest
feeling about you...

1006
01:22:29,721 --> 01:22:32,281
Especially when you are near,
as you are now.

1007
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:35,599
It feels as though I had a string

1008
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:40,713
tied here, under my left rib,
where my heart is.

1009
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:47,001
Tightly knotted to you...
in a similar fashion.

1010
01:22:48,841 --> 01:22:50,361
When you go to Ireland,

1011
01:22:51,321 --> 01:22:53,721
with all that distance
between us,

1012
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:57,801
I'm afraid this cord
will be snapped...

1013
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:00,721
and I shall bleed inwardly.

1014
01:23:02,081 --> 01:23:03,121
But you are sensible.

1015
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:05,561
- You'll forget.
- I'll never forget!

1016
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:08,201
I wish I had never been born.

1017
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:10,081
I wish I'd never come
to Thornfield.

1018
01:23:10,112 --> 01:23:12,112
There are other houses just as fine.

1019
01:23:12,361 --> 01:23:14,241
How can you be so stupid?

1020
01:23:14,841 --> 01:23:16,641
How can you be so cruel?

1021
01:23:17,241 --> 01:23:20,681
I may be poor and plain,
but I'm not without feelings.

1022
01:23:21,641 --> 01:23:23,881
It's not the house,
but the life here.

1023
01:23:23,961 --> 01:23:25,561
I was not trampled on.

1024
01:23:26,521 --> 01:23:28,201
I was not excluded.

1025
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:31,161
I was treated as an equal.

1026
01:23:35,361 --> 01:23:37,121
And so you are, Jane.

1027
01:23:52,081 --> 01:23:53,121
And so...

1028
01:23:56,561 --> 01:23:57,641
And so...

1029
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,361
Yes, so, sir...

1030
01:24:03,201 --> 01:24:05,881
And yet not so,
for you are a married man.

1031
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:07,881
Or as good as married.

1032
01:24:08,481 --> 01:24:09,841
- Let me go.
- Be still.

1033
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:15,101
Don't struggle. You are like
a bird clawing at its cage.

1034
01:24:15,136 --> 01:24:18,641
I'm no caged bird. I'm
a free human being, independent,

1035
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:20,441
with a will of my own.

1036
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:23,561
Then stay.

1037
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:27,921
Stay and marry me.

1038
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:31,521
- How dare you make fun of me?
- I mean what I say.

1039
01:24:32,315 --> 01:24:34,675
Stay at Thornfield.
Be my wife.

1040
01:24:35,721 --> 01:24:36,921
What of Miss Ingram?

1041
01:24:37,201 --> 01:24:39,921
I don't love Miss Ingram,
nor does she love me.

1042
01:24:43,401 --> 01:24:46,921
Jane, you strange,
almost unearthly thing,

1043
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:50,881
I love you
as my own flesh.

1044
01:24:54,321 --> 01:24:55,961
I beg of you to marry me.

1045
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:03,121
Say Edward, give me my name.

1046
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:08,441
Say Edward, I will marry you.

1047
01:25:17,469 --> 01:25:18,229
Yes.

1048
01:25:19,673 --> 01:25:20,553
Yes.

1049
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,241
Yes, Edward.

1050
01:25:37,449 --> 01:25:39,649
I hardly know what to say.

1051
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:42,801
I'm so astonished,
I feel I must have been dreaming.

1052
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:48,321
I thought Mr. Rochester
came in here

1053
01:25:48,841 --> 01:25:50,121
and said...

1054
01:25:50,481 --> 01:25:54,361
that in a month's time
you were to be his wife.

1055
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:56,841
He said the same to me.

1056
01:25:58,161 --> 01:25:59,961
You know how much I like you,

1057
01:26:00,081 --> 01:26:01,441
Jane, but...

1058
01:26:03,601 --> 01:26:04,841
you are so young...

1059
01:26:06,001 --> 01:26:08,401
and little acquainted with men.

1060
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:12,561
I have noticed

1061
01:26:12,761 --> 01:26:16,201
Mr. Rochester is growing
fondness for you...

1062
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:19,961
And I have wanted
so many times...

1063
01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:23,561
for your sake,

1064
01:26:23,841 --> 01:26:25,921
to put you on your guard.

1065
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:27,241
Why?

1066
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:30,441
There is an old saying...

1067
01:26:31,241 --> 01:26:33,881
"All is not gold
that glitters."

1068
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:38,281
And in this case I fear...

1069
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:42,761
something different...

1070
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:44,881
may be found...

1071
01:26:45,361 --> 01:26:47,481
from what you or I expect.

1072
01:26:47,761 --> 01:26:50,361
Is it impossible
that Mr. Rochester

1073
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:52,401
should have a sincere
affection for me?

1074
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:53,641
Oh, no, no.

1075
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,881
It is not that,
my dear, it's...

1076
01:26:57,681 --> 01:26:59,321
He is a proud man.

1077
01:26:59,641 --> 01:27:01,241
All the Rochesters
were proud.

1078
01:27:03,641 --> 01:27:05,921
And gentlemen in his station

1079
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:09,241
are not accustomed to marrying
their governesses.

1080
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:27,561
Now, then...

1081
01:27:29,361 --> 01:27:31,601
Let's try the cape on,
shall we?

1082
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:33,841
There... Turn around.

1083
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:35,521
Turn around, dear.

1084
01:27:36,281 --> 01:27:39,201
Oh, you look beautiful.

1085
01:27:46,841 --> 01:27:50,081
- Have you been to the chapel?
- Yes sir, the parson just arrived.

1086
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:52,321
- The carriage?
- The horses have been harnessed.

1087
01:27:52,561 --> 01:27:55,581
- We'll leave the moment it s over.
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:27:55,627 --> 01:27:58,827
- Jane!
- Yes, I'm here.

1089
01:28:07,613 --> 01:28:08,773
Any regrets?

1090
01:28:10,144 --> 01:28:14,184
Only that Adele is away at school. She'd have
loved to see me in this dress.

1091
01:28:14,761 --> 01:28:16,801
I will have a portrait painted

1092
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:19,561
and sent to her.

1093
01:28:20,881 --> 01:28:21,921
Like this,

1094
01:28:21,961 --> 01:28:22,761
with the morning light above you.

1095
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:48,001
We are gathered together
in the sight of God...

1096
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:52,361
to join together
this man and this woman

1097
01:28:52,801 --> 01:28:54,041
in Holy Matrimony.

1098
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:59,441
... so many as are coupled together
but as God's word

1099
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:00,841
both allow,

1100
01:29:01,281 --> 01:29:03,081
are not joined together by God...

1101
01:29:03,521 --> 01:29:05,241
The marriage cannot go on.

1102
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:07,721
I declare an impediment.

1103
01:29:11,121 --> 01:29:12,961
- Continue, sir.
- I cannot.

1104
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,281
What is the nature
of this impediment?

1105
01:29:20,801 --> 01:29:22,361
Mr. Rochester

1106
01:29:22,781 --> 01:29:23,981
is a married man.

1107
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:28,841
- Who are you?
- My name is Briggs.

1108
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,361
I'm a lawyer.

1109
01:29:30,401 --> 01:29:32,401
I was engaged to look after
the interests

1110
01:29:32,641 --> 01:29:34,201
of your wife.

1111
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:35,761
There is no wife!

1112
01:29:35,841 --> 01:29:40,401
'I affirm and can prove that
on the 20th day of October 1829,

1113
01:29:41,201 --> 01:29:45,481
Edward Fairfax Rochester of
Thornfield Hall, was married

1114
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:47,081
to my sister,

1115
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:49,201
Bertha Antoinetta.

1116
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:50,761
A copy of the wedding

1117
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:54,161
certificate is now
in my possession.'

1118
01:29:54,201 --> 01:29:57,241
Signed, Richard Mason.

1119
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:02,641
That proves I have been married,
not that the women is still living.

1120
01:30:02,761 --> 01:30:06,081
She was living three months ago.
I have a witness to the fact.

1121
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:07,841
Produce him, damn you!

1122
01:30:08,001 --> 01:30:09,681
Sir, do not forget you are in

1123
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:10,561
a sacred place.

1124
01:30:10,961 --> 01:30:14,041
Have the goodness
to step forward, sir.

1125
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,001
Mason!

1126
01:30:32,681 --> 01:30:33,761
Close your book.

1127
01:30:36,081 --> 01:30:37,601
There'll be no wedding.

1128
01:30:41,401 --> 01:30:43,481
What these men say is true.

1129
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:46,201
I have been married...

1130
01:30:49,881 --> 01:30:52,361
the woman to whom
I was married lives still.

1131
01:30:57,241 --> 01:30:58,761
Come to the house,
all of you...

1132
01:30:59,801 --> 01:31:02,601
and meet Grace Pooles patient...

1133
01:31:03,641 --> 01:31:05,161
My wife!

1134
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:29,921
Stay out of the way, Grace.

1135
01:31:30,921 --> 01:31:32,001
Be careful, sir.

1136
01:31:32,641 --> 01:31:34,161
She's a bit snappish.

1137
01:31:38,921 --> 01:31:41,601
She's seen you, sir,
you'd better not stay.

1138
01:31:41,841 --> 01:31:43,721
- We'd better leave.
- You stay here!

1139
01:31:44,841 --> 01:31:45,921
This is my wife.

1140
01:31:46,361 --> 01:31:47,921
Your sister, Mason.

1141
01:31:48,801 --> 01:31:51,201
Look at her. She is mad.

1142
01:31:51,281 --> 01:31:52,761
So was her mother.

1143
01:31:54,241 --> 01:31:55,321
So was her grandmother.

1144
01:31:56,921 --> 01:32:00,161
Three generations
of violent lunacy.

1145
01:32:00,196 --> 01:32:01,281
I wasn't told

1146
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:03,241
about that,
was I, Mason?

1147
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:05,041
Or I was told about

1148
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:07,961
was that my father had made a
suitable match to prop up

1149
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:10,161
his dwindling fortune
and give your family

1150
01:32:10,401 --> 01:32:11,961
the Rochester name.

1151
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:14,921
I did what I was told!

1152
01:32:19,241 --> 01:32:20,601
And Bertha

1153
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,441
was kept away from me

1154
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:26,481
until the wedding.
It was cleverly done.

1155
01:32:28,681 --> 01:32:30,721
Everyone got what they wanted

1156
01:32:31,161 --> 01:32:32,361
except me.

1157
01:32:33,601 --> 01:32:34,641
Even

1158
01:32:35,481 --> 01:32:38,081
she is better off here than
she would be in a lunatic asylum...

1159
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:41,601
but I have spent
the last 15 years in torment.

1160
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:49,881
So what I...

1161
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,681
what I wish to have.

1162
01:32:52,561 --> 01:32:55,601
This young girl who stands
so grave and quiet to the month

1163
01:32:55,636 --> 01:32:56,721
of Hell.

1164
01:32:57,201 --> 01:32:58,161
Look at the difference

1165
01:33:01,521 --> 01:33:03,441
Then judge me!

1166
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:07,761
Priest on the gospell
and man of the law

1167
01:33:07,796 --> 01:33:10,641
and remenber with what judgement
he judge he

1168
01:33:21,561 --> 01:33:23,121
Bertha!
No, Ma'am.

1169
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:27,881
Hold her down!

1170
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:30,921
Keep calm, lass, calm.
Hold her, Grace.

1171
01:33:31,201 --> 01:33:32,081
Take care.

1172
01:33:32,121 --> 01:33:33,441
Calm, calm, lass.

1173
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:08,281
I love you.

1174
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,361
Say you love me.

1175
01:34:12,641 --> 01:34:14,281
I love you more than ever.

1176
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:17,241
But this is the last time
I shall ever say it.

1177
01:34:18,241 --> 01:34:19,521
I must leave you.

1178
01:34:48,761 --> 01:34:50,641
Don't leave me, Jane!

1179
01:35:01,121 --> 01:35:02,041
The horse!

1180
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:16,521
Mr. Rochester!

1181
01:35:18,481 --> 01:35:20,401
Mr. Rochester!
The house, sir!

1182
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:02,561
Trust me, Bertha, trust me.
Leah...

1183
01:36:02,801 --> 01:36:04,841
John, where's Mr. Rochester?

1184
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:07,641
Mr. Rochester, help me!

1185
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:09,761
Help me, somebody!

1186
01:36:22,321 --> 01:36:23,121
Bertha.

1187
01:36:24,315 --> 01:36:27,235
Bertha, come close to me,
don't be afraid.

1188
01:36:27,902 --> 01:36:28,862
Come to me.

1189
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,640
Please, give me your hand.

1190
01:36:31,213 --> 01:36:32,573
Bertha, come to me.

1191
01:36:32,932 --> 01:36:34,532
- No.
- I would never harm you.

1192
01:36:35,979 --> 01:36:38,059
Don't be afraid.
Come to me, now.

1193
01:36:39,004 --> 01:36:39,924
Please.

1194
01:36:41,015 --> 01:36:41,815
Come, come on.

1195
01:36:45,881 --> 01:36:46,841
No!

1196
01:36:56,661 --> 01:36:57,621
Jane!

1197
01:37:10,841 --> 01:37:15,641
With no direction or wilth to
my future, I travelled for many days

1198
01:37:19,481 --> 01:37:25,641
At last, as prompted by old memories,
I made my way back to home of parson.

1199
01:37:26,281 --> 01:37:28,481
That once was kind to me.

1200
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:32,521
And this is for you!
Thank you! Good day to you!

1201
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:37,481
Is Miss Eyre, isn't it?

1202
01:37:38,761 --> 01:37:42,521
Do you, remember me? I'm Mary Rivers,
the rector's sister.

1203
01:37:45,481 --> 01:37:46,481
Are you ill?

1204
01:38:00,721 --> 01:38:02,841
- How is she?
- She's had a good sleep.

1205
01:38:02,881 --> 01:38:04,641
Now may be a good time
to talk to her.

1206
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:11,241
- How are you feeling?
- You're looking much better.

1207
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:13,081
The doctor is very pleased.

1208
01:38:13,321 --> 01:38:15,801
You should be well enough
to come down in a few days.

1209
01:38:16,401 --> 01:38:18,521
I have been here almost a month.

1210
01:38:18,801 --> 01:38:21,041
I can't stay here any longer.

1211
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:23,601
I must find work
and somewhere to live.

1212
01:38:23,681 --> 01:38:25,361
Hush, be still.

1213
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:27,081
You should stay as long as you wish.

1214
01:38:27,881 --> 01:38:31,361
Don't make her talk any more.

1215
01:38:31,601 --> 01:38:32,601
Tell her.

1216
01:38:36,401 --> 01:38:37,361
Miss Eyre.

1217
01:38:39,401 --> 01:38:41,921
I did not want to excite
you beyond your strength,

1218
01:38:41,956 --> 01:38:43,801
but I have some very surprising news.

1219
01:38:44,521 --> 01:38:47,121
A gentleman has been here
looking for you.

1220
01:38:47,441 --> 01:38:48,281
A lawyer.

1221
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:52,001
I took it upon myself
to act on your behalf.

1222
01:38:52,161 --> 01:38:53,121
A lawyer.

1223
01:38:54,081 --> 01:38:55,241
What did he want?

1224
01:38:57,361 --> 01:39:01,481
It seems your uncle in Madeira,
John Eyre, has died

1225
01:39:01,721 --> 01:39:03,521
and has left you his entire estate.

1226
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:05,646
He always believed you were alive

1227
01:39:05,681 --> 01:39:08,481
and he had the greatest faith
that one day you would be found.

1228
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,921
You are his only
surviving relative.

1229
01:39:14,561 --> 01:39:16,241
You have become a wealthy woman.

1230
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:23,121
These are the papers relating
to your uncle,

1231
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:27,041
and the fortune
you will inherit.

1232
01:39:28,241 --> 01:39:29,961
This is your uncle, John Eyre.

1233
01:39:35,321 --> 01:39:36,281
And this is your father...

1234
01:39:36,961 --> 01:39:38,601
the father you never knew.

1235
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:42,441
How young he looks.

1236
01:39:43,121 --> 01:39:44,401
And how kind.

1237
01:39:44,641 --> 01:39:45,681
He was kind.

1238
01:39:46,841 --> 01:39:49,321
Amongst the papers
is the letter he wrote

1239
01:39:49,681 --> 01:39:52,161
to your uncle announcing
your birth.

1240
01:39:56,801 --> 01:39:58,481
You were deeply loved Miss Eyre.

1241
01:40:02,001 --> 01:40:03,121
Please forgive me.

1242
01:40:05,721 --> 01:40:07,241
There is nothing to forgive.

1243
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:15,921
I know you have suffered greatly.

1244
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:19,801
But the past can no longer
harm you.

1245
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:23,761
You are safe now.

1246
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:31,075
As the months past,
my health recovered

1247
01:40:31,396 --> 01:40:32,881
and my strength returned.

1248
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:37,801
The more I knew them,
the better I like them.

1249
01:40:47,928 --> 01:40:50,693
But despite their
generosity and kindness

1250
01:40:50,798 --> 01:40:54,478
my thoughts were constantly
drawn back to the past.

1251
01:40:54,921 --> 01:40:58,761
The places and people
I could not forget.

1252
01:41:13,641 --> 01:41:15,561
Jane!

1253
01:41:25,161 --> 01:41:26,121
Jane!

1254
01:41:33,801 --> 01:41:37,281
You have been with us now
for nearly six months

1255
01:41:37,316 --> 01:41:39,926
and in that time I have come to
respect you 

1256
01:41:39,961 --> 01:41:43,601
and to admire you very much.

1257
01:41:43,636 --> 01:41:46,578
I don't expect you to love me, now,

1258
01:41:46,613 --> 01:41:49,486
undoubtedly enough
of love would follow

1259
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:53,201
upon marriage to render the
union right even in your eyes.

1260
01:41:54,841 --> 01:41:57,446
All I'm asking you for
is your affection,

1261
01:41:57,481 --> 01:42:01,161
your care,
your companionship.

1262
01:42:01,196 --> 01:42:02,481
You have all those things.

1263
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:03,406
Jane!

1264
01:42:03,441 --> 01:42:09,601
What I'm offering you is trustworthy
and good, it is real it is lasting.

1265
01:42:10,561 --> 01:42:15,361
I'm very touched by what you say,
but I cannot decide now.

1266
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:17,481
You must give me time to think.

1267
01:42:17,516 --> 01:42:18,441
Of course!

1268
01:42:19,401 --> 01:42:21,366
But however I decide, I shall give

1269
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:25,121
part of my inheritance to benefit
the girls at Lowell school.

1270
01:42:26,121 --> 01:42:27,606
And, please, I want you to take

1271
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,921
whatever you need for
your mission in rework.

1272
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:32,801
Would you arrange it for me?

1273
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:28,081
Mrs. Fairfax?

1274
01:44:35,281 --> 01:44:36,321
Pilot.

1275
01:44:37,356 --> 01:44:38,216
Hello, Pilot.

1276
01:44:38,406 --> 01:44:39,131
Pilot!

1277
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:44,241
Pilot!

1278
01:44:48,096 --> 01:44:49,256
No more noise.

1279
01:44:52,081 --> 01:44:53,041
Miss Eyre!

1280
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:06,321
Mrs. Fairfax,

1281
01:45:07,321 --> 01:45:09,041
bring me a glass of water.

1282
01:45:24,441 --> 01:45:25,441
Who's there?

1283
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:27,801
Who is it?

1284
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:30,401
Pilot knows me.

1285
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:38,761
My brain will burst.

1286
01:45:41,532 --> 01:45:43,572
What delusion is this?

1287
01:45:46,241 --> 01:45:47,721
What sweet madness!

1288
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:54,561
Her fingers.

1289
01:45:54,841 --> 01:45:56,081
Her very fingers.

1290
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:58,241
Jane Eyre.

1291
01:45:59,201 --> 01:46:00,361
Jane Eyre.

1292
01:46:02,681 --> 01:46:05,241
So many times I've dreamed
of this moment.

1293
01:46:05,681 --> 01:46:08,441
Then the dream vanishes
and flies away.

1294
01:46:12,481 --> 01:46:15,001
Gentle dream.
Kiss me before you go.

1295
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:16,801
I shall never leave you.

1296
01:46:30,161 --> 01:46:31,961
You will stay with me?

1297
01:46:34,081 --> 01:46:35,041
How?

1298
01:46:35,921 --> 01:46:39,801
I will be your friend,
your nurse, your companion.

1299
01:46:41,001 --> 01:46:44,041
You will not be left alone
for so long as shall I live.

1300
01:46:56,698 --> 01:46:59,258
I'm no better than a ruined tree.

1301
01:47:01,841 --> 01:47:05,081
I'm lightning struck
and decayed.

1302
01:47:05,561 --> 01:47:06,841
You are no ruin, sir.

1303
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:09,841
You are vigorous
and full of life.

1304
01:47:11,281 --> 01:47:14,401
Plants will grow
and wind around you,

1305
01:47:15,081 --> 01:47:18,041
because your strength offers them
so safe a hold.

1306
01:47:39,681 --> 01:47:42,001
And so I married him.

1307
01:47:42,761 --> 01:47:44,561
Slowly but surely,

1308
01:47:44,761 --> 01:47:47,201
Edward recovered his sight.

1309
01:47:47,481 --> 01:47:49,801
And when our first born
was put into his arms,

1310
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:53,121
he could see that our child
had inherited his eyes

1311
01:47:53,156 --> 01:47:54,761
as they once were,

1312
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:57,441
large and brilliant

1313
01:47:57,601 --> 01:47:59,321
and shining with life.

1314
01:47:59,441 --> 01:48:02,401
We sent for Adele,
she now lives with us,

1315
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:06,970
as beloved as if she
was our own dear daughter.

1316
01:48:06,161 --> 01:48:09,321
We are truly devoted,
my Edward and I.

1317
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:11,801
Our hearts beat as one.

1318
01:48:12,441 --> 01:48:14,321
Our happiness is complete.
