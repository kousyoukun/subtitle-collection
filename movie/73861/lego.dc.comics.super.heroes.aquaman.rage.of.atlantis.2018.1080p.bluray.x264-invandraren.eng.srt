- Great!
- (CHUCKLES) You got that right, Tin Man!

159
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:03,377
You're gonna have to try harder
to put down the Main Man.

160

Maybe Batman can stop him with something
from his cute little tool belt thingy.

00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:16,265
What? You know, his little belt of bags.
It's adorable.

164
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,895
(GROWLS) You mean my Utility Belt!
It's a convenient storage space

165
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,355
for an assortment of tools
without them getting in the way!

166
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,900
Would a cute little belt thingy do that?

167
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,026
Uh, kinda.

168
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,652
- Maybe.
- You be you, Batman.

169

- Focus!

we'll have to work together.

Um, well, don't wait for me!

173

- Two...
- Don't screw this up.

Thanks, team. I'm glad you showed up.

- Yes, I am aware.

How does it feel to have
been humiliated by Lobo,

212
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,501
and saved, once again, by the Justice League?

213
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:54,381
Well, I'm part of a team.
A win for us all is a win for me.

214
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,258
So, you don't mind that the world watched

215
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,678
the King of Atlantis
run away from Lobo like a scared fish?

216
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,681
No, that's
an unfair characterization of fish.

217
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,352
- And, uh, I didn't run.
- Lois, if I may?

218
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,188
Aquaman is an essential member
of the Justice League.

219
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,441
- In what way?
- Now, well, he... Uh...

- He, uh...
- Don't look at me. I just got here.

221
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:20,115
Aquaman's ability to talk to sea life
is a critical skill.

222
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,202
One that I'm sure
he'll use with great effectiveness,

223
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,538
sometime in the future,
when it becomes necessary.

There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

Aquaman's teammates
are 100% supportive of him,

and run this on tonight's seven o'clock.

229

I wouldn't worry about it, Aquaman.

230
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,059
Not many people watch network news anymore.

231
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,938
Oh, I'm not worried.
Besides, we don't get cable in Atlantis.

232
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,650
I'm just excited we're finally all together.

233
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,444
How about we go somewhere
to feast and celebrate?

234
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:01,782
Or, or... Or we figure out
why Lobo was here in the first place.

Yes, fish, plants.
We have everything down here.

Even froyo?

250
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,631
Well, no, that melts in the seawater,
but we have colorful rocks.

00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,344
And, uh, uh... Coral! We have coral.

252

Good observation, Cyborg.
Red and yellow wavelengths of light

We cannot. I may not be their king,
but they are still my people.

468
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,118
We must retreat and form a plan.

469
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,038
I know a way out, but we need a distraction.

470
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:43,793
Well, lucky for you, my super useful
Utility Belt has just the thing.

You've done well, Ocean Master.

476

You mean "King Ocean Master."

477

Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

478
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,109
My plan to infect the Atlanteans

479
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,696
with my Red Lantern rage
seems to have worked.

480
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,160
At last, all of Atlantis bows to me!

481
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,371
And now begins Stage Two.

483

These secret tunnels
are only known to the royal family.

484
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,008
If we act quickly, we might
be able to get out before they stop us.

485
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,511
How? I'm sure they have
the palace surrounded.

486
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,305
- The Sea Gate, of course.
- The "Sea" what now?

487
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,557
Behold!

488
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,189
What is that?

489
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,608
That is the Sea Gate.

490
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,111
It can open an interdimensional portal

491
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:55,323
between Atlantis and other aquatic
planets throughout the universe!

492

496
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,504
Well, I don't know
how to change the location,

497
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,382

you won't have a people to save.

there are more people on the other side,

And more importantly, where is Green Lantern?

Unfortunately, this crisis
proved too much for her inexperience.

She's a bit too green.
We'll have to go back and get her.

Well, Wonder Woman,

They're readying for an invasion,

- It could go either way.
- Of course.

That's Dex-Starr, the Red Lantern cat.

It's all so clear now.

549
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,258
Atrocitus and Ocean Master
are using the Sea Gate in Atlantis

550
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,053
to bring an armada
of rage-fueled battle machines to Earth.

Impossible! The Sea Gate isn't designed
to be able to transport an army!

That's what's powering the Gate!

00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:28,536
Now, Atrocitus can use Atlantis as
a beachhead to attack the surface world.
