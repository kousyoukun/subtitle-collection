1
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,617
Okay, Jessica, keep it together.
You got this!

2
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,415
Hal needed an off-road vacay,
and you're a Green Lantern.

3
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:42,085
He asked you to cover his shift
at the Hall of Justice, no biggie.

4
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,378
You are calm, collected, and in control.

5
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:50,301
<i>Calm, collected, and in control, hmm?</i>

6
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,763
Shush, you! I don't remember
Hal's Ring talking back to him.

7
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,393
<i>That's because Green Lantern Jordan
had accumulated enough Lantern points</i>

8
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,687
<i>to unlock the mute button.</i>

9
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,313
Ring, enable mute.

10
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:06,442
<i>You, however,
Green Lantern Jessica Cruz, have not!</i>

11
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:09,612
- Looks like trouble.
- Oh, hi, Justice League.

12
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,906
Uh, I didn't touch it.
I mean, I was going to touch it,

13
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,075
but I didn't touch it,
so it isn't my fault, I swear!

14
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,202
And everyone is looking at me,
and I should shut up now!

15
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:19,289
- <i>Minus five Lantern points.</i>
- What for?

16
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,542
- <i>Don't make excuses.</i>
- Not to worry, Green Lantern.

17
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,212
You didn't do anything wrong.
This is the trouble alert.

18
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,965
- It alerts us when...
- When there's trouble?

19
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,801
Yes, see? You're a natural at this.

20
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,429
Breaking News with Lois Lane <i>live.</i>

21
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:38,641
It seems trouble is exactly what we've got.

22
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,352
And it starts with a capital "L."

23
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:45,857
Well, Lois is many things, Batman,
but I wouldn't call her trouble.

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,817
Not Lois, Superman. Look!

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,945
This is Lois Lane
reporting from Area 52 at Dread Lake,

26
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:54,699
where the intergalactic bounty hunter
known as Lobo is on a rampage.

27
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:05,126
This is like looking for a Denebian needle
in an Alterian haystack creature.

28
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,755
The now-defunct Area 52 facility
was an attempt to streamline

29
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:12,425
the military's overly complex
secret alien technology department.

30
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,802
Defunct? I thought
they just built that thing.

31
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,139
The simplification program
made things much more complicated.

32
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,517
They moved everything
to a warehouse in Rebirth, New Jersey.

33
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,692
Where are you, you little
Denebian slime bender? Yeah!

34
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:33,196
Lobo, a Czarnian who is
super strong, super tough,

35
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,908
and has a super potty mouth,
appears to be in search of something.

36
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,702
There's no telling what
dangerous artifact Lobo will discover.

37
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,496
We need to get to Dread Lake fast.

38
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,122
<i>Did someone say "Lake"?</i>

39
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:46,376
<i>Why, that sounds like a job for Aquaman!</i>

40
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,504
Aquaman, you should know that
Dread Lake isn't really your...

41
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>Whoa. Sorry. Reception
down here is a little spotty.</i>

42
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,051
<i>I'll see you there. Aquaman out!</i>

43
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,265
Evidently, he did not get my memo
about building an undersea cell tower.

44
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,727
We really should build
an undersea cell tower down here.

45
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,604
The reception is horrible, Orm.

46
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:11,150
I told you, brother,
I prefer to be called "Ocean Master".

47
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,153
Oh, sorry, Ocean Master.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,281
Don't worry, I'll call you whatever you want.

49
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:22,495
Oh. There she is. The Aquajet!

50
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,164
We just detailed it for you, sire.

51
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,750
And a wonderful job you did, too.

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,546
You guys are great.
I love being the king of you.

53
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,425
I almost feel bad about taking it
up to the dusty old surface world.

54
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:39,387
No, no, no. Go! You're needed up there.

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,891
I'll take care of everything
down here while you're gone. Again.

56
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,059
Aw.

57
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,062
Thanks, Ormi!

58
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,149
- It's "Ocean Master".
- Right. Right, right.

59
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,401
Although, kind of a weird nickname,

60
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,279
seeing as I am
the King of the Seven Seas and all.

61
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,072
But, uh, whatever.

62
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,908
I'm just glad
we can move beyond our petty squabbles,

63
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:04,203
and work to help Atlantis, nay, the world!

64
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,205
Together!

65
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,418
Yes, I love being a team player.

66
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:15,798
Tell Mera I'll be home for dinner.
It's great to be King.

67
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,430
Is it? We'll soon see.

68
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,437
What? Get back to work!

69
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,446
All right, Aquajet, we're freshwater bound.

70
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,866
It's so gratifying
when my friends in the Justice League

71
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,869
have a water-based problem
and they need my help.

72
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,632
Where are you?

73
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,676
You can't hide from the Main Man forever!

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,845
Yeah!

75
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:06,307
- Okay, Jimmy. On me.
- Lois? Is this a good idea?

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,684
Pulitzers were never won
with good ideas, Jimmy.

77
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,061
Now, come on.

78
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,021
Uh, isn't that the only reason
they're awarded?

79
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,067
Lobo! Lois Lane
reporting for the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

80
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,028
Argh! Paparazzi!

81
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,738
No, I'm a serious journalist.

82
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:24,492
If I were paparazzi, I'd have to criticize
your atrocious fashion choices.

83
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,953
- So 1983.
- What?

84
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:32,667
Lady, the Main Man always says,
"Black is the new black!"

85
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:36,546
Well, I say, the Main Man
is about to be feeling the pain, man!

86
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:39,549
- Says who?
- Says the Justice League!

87
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,217
Jimmy, duck!

88
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,512
Pleasure to meet you, Lobo.

89
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,932
I am Aquaman, Master of the Seven Seas,

90
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,977
defender of dolphins, King of Atlantis.

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,813
- Wrecker of jets!
- Wrecker of...

92
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,190
Uh, I am unfamiliar with that moniker.

93
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,025
Let me fix that!

94
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,282
So long, you Fluvian seaweed farmer!

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,793
No, don't do that! Those are critical.

96
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:19,672
Hey! This is a custom-built vehicle,
and it was just waxed!

97
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:25,303
It seems that Aquaman inexplicably is
the first of the Justice League to arrive.

98
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,513
Despite the fact that we are in the desert.

99
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,058
Uh, farewell, mighty Aquajet,
you've served your King well!

100
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,483
Aquaman! Lois Lane of the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

101
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,320
It looks like you really,
as we professional journalists say,

102
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:46,073
"Got your tail fin handed to you"
by the Main Man, Lobo!

103
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,075
No need to worry, Miss Lane.

104
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,413
I'll just call for backup,
using my aqua-telepathic powers

105
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:56,709
to summon my fellow water creatures,
here at Dread Lake.

106
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,086
But Dread Lake is a dry lake bed!

107
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,008
Well, that would be
challenging then, wouldn't it?

108
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,512
So much for plan A, B, and C.
No matter, I am still really strong.

109
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,597
And... Huh?

110
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,105
Ow! Jeez!

111
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,357
That's gotta hurt!

112
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,985
Good golly, Miss Lane. Aquaman
is really getting filleted out there!

113
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,862
Not in the face, not in the face!

114
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,448
Get out of here!

115
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,659
Help!

116
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,747
This is no way to treat royalty!

117
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,458
Yeah! A royal pain in the bleezors!

118
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,628
This is why you never send a fish
to do a man's job.

119
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,255
- Jimmy, tell me you're getting this.
- Every frame.

120
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,299
But what happens when Lobo gets us?

121
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,260
Don't panic, Jimmy.
Here comes the Justice League!

122
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,270
It's hero time!

123
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,899
You want me to hero now, really?

124
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:05,236
In front of the whole Justice League?
With everyone watching?

125
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,532
Come on, Green Lantern. Or you'll miss
our stylish superhero landing.

126
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,159
Oh! Who would wanna miss that?

127
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,129
- Jimmy! Slow-mo hero entrance.
- Ooh, right!

128
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,172
Still plenty of time to get the best part!

129
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,178
Give yourself up now, Lobo.

130
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,596
You may be strong where you come from,

131
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,558
but the yellow sun of Earth
makes me the strongest...

132
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,604
Give up? The Main Man don't give up ever!

133
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:45,443
I actually felt that!

134
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,823
We might need some help.

135
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,993
Ah! I'll be out of here in a trice!

136
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,370
Lobo is as strong as Superman?

137
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,707
- Great!
- You got that right, Tin Man!

138
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:03,377
You're gonna have to try harder
to put down the Main Man.

139
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:08,090
Maybe Batman can stop him with something
from his cute little tool belt thingy.

140
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,342
Oh, no, she didn't.

141
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:11,761
Ha!

142
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:16,265
What? You know, his little belt of bags.
It's adorable.

143
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,895
You mean my Utility Belt!
It's a convenient storage space

144
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,355
for an assortment of tools
without them getting in the way!

145
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,900
Would a cute little belt thingy do that?

146
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,026
Uh, kinda.

147
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,652
- Maybe.
- You be you, Batman.

148
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,280
- I'm sorry. I just thought...
- Focus!

149
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,450
If we want to succeed,
we'll have to work together.

150
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,244
Everyone, on the count of three. One...

151
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,164
Um, well, don't wait for me!

152
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,041
- Two...
- Don't screw this up.

153
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,293
Gotta make something big, strong.

154
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,419
Three!

155
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,549
A safe? Argh!

156
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,094
<i>Oh, how brave. Minus one point.</i>

157
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,102
Ha! Child's play!

158
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,982
Hey! Keep kicking those flippers,
Mr. Jellyfish!

159
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,860
Uh, Jellyfish don't actually have flippers.

160
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,613
Mind if I take you for a spin?

161
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,704
Superman, Cyborg, now!

162
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:35,803
Hey. Ah! So, this is where
you've been hiding?

163
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,848
Come to Papa!

164
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,976
- The show is over, right?
- It better be.

165
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,228
We hit him with everything we've got!

166
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,026
If that's all you've got,
you better get more.

167
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,988
Impossible. There's not a scratch on him!

168
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,365
Lantern, hit him with everything you've got.

169
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,325
Uh, okay.

170
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,452
I did it!

171
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,081
I didn't do it.

172
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,960
I'd love to stay and play,
but I've got what I came for.

173
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,342
So long, Justice Losers!

174
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,261
Quick! Before he gets away!

175
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,181
Yeah!

176
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,392
- Good riddance.
- What do you think he was here for?

177
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,521
I don't know.
But whatever it is, it can't be good.

178
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,899
Um. Anyone seen Aquaman?

179
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:34,028
- A little help, please!
- Don't worry. I'll save you!

180
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,492
Thanks, team. I'm glad you showed up.
We really saved the day.

181
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,994
Am I right?

182
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,538
- Lois Lane, <i>Daily Planet.</i>
- Yes, I am aware.

183
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,874
How does it feel to have
been humiliated by Lobo,

184
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,501
and saved, once again, by the Justice League?

185
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:54,381
Well, I'm part of a team.
A win for us all is a win for me.

186
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,258
So, you don't mind that the world watched

187
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,678
the King of Atlantis
run away from Lobo like a scared fish?

188
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,681
No, that's
an unfair characterization of fish.

189
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,352
- And, uh, I didn't run.
- Lois, if I may?

190
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,188
Aquaman is an essential member
of the Justice League.

191
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,441
- In what way?
- Now, well, he... Uh...

192
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:16,278
- He, uh...
- Don't look at me. I just got here.

193
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:20,115
Aquaman's ability to talk to sea life
is a critical skill.

194
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,202
One that I'm sure
he'll use with great effectiveness,

195
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,538
sometime in the future,
when it becomes necessary.

196
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,540
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,460
Aquaman's teammates
are 100% supportive of him,

198
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,672
despite his overly specialized powers.

199
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,300
For the <i>Daily Planet,</i>
Lois Lane is signing off.

200
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:42,471
Cut! Great stuff. Let's get back home
and run this on tonight's seven o'clock.

201
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,390
I wouldn't worry about it, Aquaman.

202
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,059
Not many people watch network news anymore.

203
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,938
Oh, I'm not worried.
Besides, we don't get cable in Atlantis.

204
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,650
I'm just excited we're finally all together.

205
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,444
How about we go somewhere
to feast and celebrate?

206
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:01,782
Or, or... Or we figure out
why Lobo was here in the first place.

207
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,785
Nothing says celebration like apple pie.

208
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,537
I can make you an ambrosia to make
the gods weep!

209
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,038
Let's hit Big Belly Burger!

210
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:12,167
Allow me to cordially
invite you all to Atlantis!

211
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:17,172
Where we shall celebrate my anniversary
as King of the Seven Seas!

212
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,010
We're going to Atlantis. That is so awesome!

213
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,179
Road trip under the sea! I love the sea!

214
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:28,684
Friendly fishies, peaceful porpoises.
No one watching you!

215
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,858
<i>Plus five for appropriate
construct building. Bravo!</i>

216
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,988
Ah, the ocean.

217
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:45,159
Home to the most interesting
forms of life known to man.

218
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,828
Outside of you guys, I mean.

219
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,539
Oh! Fishies!

220
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,710
Yes, fish, plants.
We have everything down here.

221
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,211
Even froyo?

222
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,631
Well, no, that melts in the seawater,
but we have colorful rocks.

223
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,344
And, uh, uh... Coral! We have coral.

224
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,512
Aren't coral and rocks the same thing?

225
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,100
Hardly.

226
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,519
Is it me, or is the water changing color?

227
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,273
Good observation, Cyborg.
Red and yellow wavelengths of light

228
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,525
can only travel so far underwater,

229
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,820
which is why everything
looks blue and green at these depths.

230
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:26,492
Oh, that lack of solar energy
is making me feel a little green.

231
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:32,706
I've got the cure for
your super seasickness here in Atlantis!

232
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,090
Beautiful.

233
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:46,095
What's that noise?
Oh, sorry, it sounds like singing.

234
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,390
Oh, that must be my song of arrival.

235
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:53,477
My people always like to sing
a little ditty when I'm returning home.

236
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,148
Atlanteans really are the nicest people
on the planet. Shh. Listen.

237
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,033
<i>Our King, the King of the Seven Seas</i>

238
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,868
<i>The mightiest hero is he!</i>

239
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,870
<i>He fights and swims, he swims and fights</i>

240
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,747
<i>No greater a hero you'll see!</i>

241
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,459
<i>A shark, a whale, a gale
No! The mightiest hero is he</i>

242
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,628
<i>He fights and swims, he swims and fights</i>

243
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:24,383
<i>The King of the ocean is he!
The King of the ocean is he!</i>

244
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:29,346
- They really love you, Aquaman.
- What's not to love?

245
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,224
Who's that guy? Looks important.

246
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,309
King Poseidon.

247
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,813
In his hand is the mystical Trident of Hope.

248
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,276
Legend states that whosoever pulls
the Trident from the statue's hand,

249
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,571
is the rightful ruler of Atlantis.

250
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,948
- Just like Excalibur!
- "Ex" what now?

251
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,783
Has anyone been able to do it?

252
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,411
No, it's just an old wives' tale,

253
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,623
although the younglings can be seen
trying to pull it out from time to time.

254
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,916
Look.

255
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,003
- I almost got it. Mine!
- You got it. You've got it.

256
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,591
And here we are!

257
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,888
Uh, question. How are we gonna
breathe down here?

258
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,599
I've developed a special Bat aqua spray

259
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,810
that will temporarily enable us
to oxygenate the water around us.

260
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,981
Oh, you keep a mist spray
in those cute little pouches?

261
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:29,406
Welcome! Please make yourselves at home.

262
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,868
As my dolphin friends
from the Gulf of Mexico say...

263
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,416
Roughly translated, <i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

264
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,044
Arthur, you've finally returned.

265
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,880
Mera, so great to see you!

266
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,258
- Who's that tall glass of water?
- Tall?

267
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,469
Aren't we all the same size, Cyborg?

268
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,805
This is my wife, Mera.

269
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,391
Wait, you're married?

270
00:16:57,226 --> 00:17:01,772
I mean, of course, you're married.
Aquaman talks about you all the time.

271
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,567
Well, I'm sorry I haven't had a chance
to meet you all in person.

272
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,154
I've been busy perfecting my craft
while Arthur has been away.

273
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,906
- Your craft?
- Yes.

274
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,534
Not only is Mera the Queen of Atlantis,

275
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:17,663
she's also a master conjuror of hard water.

276
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,582
- Oh! Make the fish!
- Hard water?

277
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,627
- Is that like hard candy?
- Oh, no, no. It's better.

278
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,213
Watch this. Mera, make the fish!

279
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,220
Isn't that amazing?

280
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,640
Oh, my God! How did you do that?

281
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,769
Magic. With my aquakinesis,
I can make anything.

282
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,940
- Here's a car.
- Make the fish again!

283
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,527
- And a chair.
- The fish!

284
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,738
And here's your fish again, Arthur.

285
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,367
Fish! That kills me every time.

286
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,122
I am so glad you are here.

287
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,458
And just in time
for the royal feast in honor of Arthur.

288
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,670
Please, won't you join me
at the banquet in the throne room?

289
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,046
Yes!

290
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,967
Grub time! Time to put
my cast iron stomach to the test.

291
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,678
Throne room? You sit on a throne?

292
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,680
Ha! It's just a small one.

293
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,825
Oh, man,
I bet they have the best seafood here!

294
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,660
Right you are, Cyborg.

295
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:42,080
Atlantis is the culinary epicenter
of the ocean.

296
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,874
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

297
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,044
Tonight, we'll be having
your choice of seaweed burgers,

298
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,088
seaweed spaghetti or seaweed salad.

299
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,799
Seaweed? What about lobster, or crab?

300
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,134
Or maybe even some shrimp?

301
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,428
Heavens no!

302
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:00,474
Under the sea, all sea life
have full citizenship rights.

303
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:03,018
But don't worry, try the seaweed slaw.

304
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,771
It is num-num nummy in your tum-tum tummy.

305
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,277
Oh, man! I was really
looking forward to some lobster!

306
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,946
My bad.

307
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,993
Does anyone else hear that?

308
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,747
Or do I have another bad
case of super swimmers' ear?

309
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,376
Bat burp. Pardon. It's coming from outside.

310
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,214
Gather round, gather round! Closer, closer!

311
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,508
- This is really too much!
- How long is this going to go on?

312
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,760
Maybe he'll blow our minds
this time with something.

313
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,138
Last time, he talked for three hours.
I've got ships to wax!

314
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,767
I've come to discuss
a matter of grave importance.

315
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,895
The fate of Atlantis!

316
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,190
- Ocean Master.
- Who is Ocean Master?

317
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,777
Only the saltiest scoundrel
of the Seven Seas.

318
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,570
He's also my half-brother.

319
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:59,282
Once you get to know him,
he's really not that bad. Come on!

320
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,120
Ocean Master is related to Aquaman?

321
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,456
I don't recall him sharing that
on his application form.

322
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,667
Now I'll have to update his records.

323
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:13,046
You say that our King is mighty,
but on the surface world,

324
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,757
he's referred to as a joke!

325
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,468
The only joke I see around here
is up on stage!

326
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,974
Really? Let me ask you.

327
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,935
If the king can't defeat
a surface dweller up there,

328
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,605
how is he going to defend you down here, hmm?

329
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,525
I don't know. He's always
treated us pretty well.

330
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,901
Has he?

331
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:40,407
Please let me shed some light
on our beloved King.

332
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,119
<i>Warning!</i>

333
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,454
Argh!

334
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,540
Green Lantern, what are you doing?

335
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,375
The Ring just did this on its own.

336
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,627
<i>Detecting increasing levels of rage.</i>

337
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,174
What was that? What's going on?

338
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,635
As I was saying about our absent King...

339
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,888
Absent King...

340
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:07,517
How can you follow a king
that everyone laughs at? Behold!

341
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,530
Coward! Ran away!

342
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,200
Coward?

343
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:27,454
I was stalling until
the Justice League showed up!

344
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:31,416
And lastly, how can you trust a king

345
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,211
that is actually only
half-Atlantean to begin with?

346
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:41,301
Well yeah, my father was an average
run-of-the-mill surface dweller.

347
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:45,514
I have to update the files again!

348
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,433
- He can't be King!
- Argh! This changes everything.

349
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:53,313
Ocean Master, brother,
what is the meaning of this?

350
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,732
Is this payback for the time
I locked you in that bathroom?

351
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,818
Let's go inside and talk.

352
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,987
Enough talking! It's time for action!

353
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,282
Too long have you broken
the laws of Atlantis!

354
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,244
Laws? Arthur, what is he talking about?

355
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:11,998
I'll show you.
You aren't actually supposed to be King.

356
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:16,169
Behold! The Constitution of Atlantis.

357
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,172
- What does that prove?
- There, near the bottom, in fine print.

358
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,925
Here, let me use my super vision.

359
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,012
Wow! That... That is small.

360
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,223
I might need a magnifying glass.

361
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:32,352
Yet another advantage of my Utility Belt.

362
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,105
Let's see. It says,

363
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:40,569
"To rule Atlantis,
you must be full-blooded Atlantean."

364
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,320
Oh, no!

365
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,657
I can't breathe!

366
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,075
But you can breathe anywhere.

367
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,662
Oh. Good point.

368
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:55,125
So, you see, my brother,
you aren't the rightful ruler.

369
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,835
I am!

370
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,046
Ocean Master! Ocean Master!

371
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:04,384
Ocean Master! Ocean Master!

372
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,761
Arthur, what are you going to do?

373
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,347
There is only one thing I can do.

374
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:13,476
In accordance with the Atlantean law
I have sworn to uphold,

375
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,148
I hereby relinquish my crown to my brother.

376
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,442
Half-brother.

377
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,195
Rule well, my King.

378
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,907
No takesie-backsies.

379
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,579
Ocean Master! Ocean Master! Ocean Master!

380
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:36,249
Arthur! I can't believe you
just gave your throne away.

381
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,461
Mera, I have made my decision.

382
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:44,090
Without even talking to me about it?
We're supposed to be a team, Arthur.

383
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,967
- Mera, I...
- No.

384
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:50,180
This is what you want, fine.
You can do it without me!

385
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,728
Wow! What a really great trick!
She is really good.

386
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,231
Too soon? My bad.

387
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,651
Now that I am King of Atlantis,

388
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:07,864
let me introduce you to the person
who encouraged me to take what was mine.

389
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,866
<i>Threat alert! Omega detected!</i>

390
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,159
Oh, no!

391
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,535
My royal adviser,

392
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,414
and all-around good guy, Atrocitus!

393
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,713
Atrocitus!

394
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,966
<i>Execute defense maneuver. Omega five.</i>

395
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,266
This is your defense?
A couch ain't gonna do nothing!

396
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,518
Argh!

397
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,727
Who is Atrocitus?

398
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:41,064
<i>Atrocitus, leader of the Red Lantern Corps.</i>

399
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,776
<i>They have the ability to enslave minds
with the power of rage.</i>

400
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,278
<i>I suggest leaving, quickly.</i>

401
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,239
Hal spoke of the Red Lanterns.

402
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:52,867
It's their lantern light that's
infecting the Atlanteans with rage.

403
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:56,997
Looks like Green Lantern's shield
is protecting us from the red light.

404
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,962
Hello, water-dwellers.

405
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:07,674
As your new royal adviser,

406
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:10,260
my first piece of advice is,

407
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:13,221
destroy the Justice League!

408
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,807
- Destroy them!
- Get them! Get them!

409
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,975
I got the one with the cape!

410
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,062
Get out of that!

411
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,566
I'm not sure how much
more my bubble can take.

412
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,775
<i>Very little.</i>

413
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,361
It somehow doesn't feel right
to just start punching them.

414
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:32,699
We cannot. I may not be their king,
but they are still my people.

415
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,118
We must retreat and form a plan.

416
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,038
I know a way out, but we need a distraction.

417
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:43,793
Well, lucky for you, my super useful
Utility Belt has just the thing.

418
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,298
An ink bomb! Ingenious.

419
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,176
Did you see where they went?
Where did they go?

420
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,765
Find them! They couldn't have gotten far!

421
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,476
You've done well, Ocean Master.

422
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,604
You mean "King Ocean Master."

423
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:05,565
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

424
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,109
My plan to infect the Atlanteans

425
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,696
with my Red Lantern rage
seems to have worked.

426
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,160
At last, all of Atlantis bows to me!

427
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,371
And now begins Stage Two.

428
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:27,962
These secret tunnels
are only known to the royal family.

429
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,008
If we act quickly, we might
be able to get out before they stop us.

430
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,511
How? I'm sure they have
the palace surrounded.

431
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,305
- The Sea Gate, of course.
- The "Sea" what now?

432
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,557
Behold!

433
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,189
What is that?

434
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,608
That is the Sea Gate.

435
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,111
It can open an interdimensional portal

436
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:55,323
between Atlantis and other aquatic
planets throughout the universe!

437
00:26:55,406 --> 00:27:00,370
Oh, I wasn't aware that
Atlantean technology was so advanced.

438
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,705
Updating files.

439
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,415
I think they're down here!

440
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,127
Aquaman, there must be something you can do.

441
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,504
Well, I don't know
how to change the location,

442
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,382
but I can access the last place it opened to.

443
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,806
- Let's move, team.
- You go! I'll stay to close the Gate.

444
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,268
I can't leave my people
in this dire predicament, and Mera!

445
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,895
If you don't come now,
you won't have a people to save.

446
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,735
Jessica, hurry! They're coming.

447
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,364
But where does it lead? What if
there are more people on the other side,

448
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,658
with expectations and judgments?

449
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,120
<i>The odds on that are about
1.7 billion to one.</i>

450
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,788
So, you're saying there's a chance?

451
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,916
Lantern, there's no time for what ifs! Hurry!

452
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,376
There they are!

453
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,378
Wait, don't!

454
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,756
I said "don't," not "donut"!

455
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:03,183
<i>Minus five Lantern points for poor diction!</i>

456
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,603
They've escaped! Inform Atrocitus!

457
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:09,189
- Down here!
- Down here!

458
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,608
<i>Threat approaching!</i>

459
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,484
I think I heard something.

460
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,236
Thanks a lot, big mouth!

461
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,698
<i>Quick, run away from your problems.
It seems to help.</i>

462
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,910
A dead end! Oh, no! What am I going to do?

463
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:25,914
<i>Yes, if only you had the universe's
most powerful weapon in your...</i>

464
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,790
<i>Oh, wait...</i>

465
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:30,335
Come on, Ring, how about a little help here?

466
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,545
<i>You must overcome your fear.</i>

467
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,255
- I can't!
- <i>You can!</i>

468
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,676
<i>My record for selecting recruits
has been perfect. Until now, anyway.</i>

469
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,179
Well, better luck with the next candidate!

470
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,683
Whoa!

471
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,815
Nailed it!

472
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,902
On the run from my own kingdom.

473
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,489
- Outrageous.
- Where are we?

474
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:04,285
It looks like some sort of factory.
But what are they making?

475
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,621
And more importantly, where is Green Lantern?

476
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:10,667
Unfortunately, this crisis
proved too much for her inexperience.

477
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,671
She's a bit too green.
We'll have to go back and get her.

478
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,215
Aquaman, can you turn the Sea Gate back on?

479
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,133
Turn it back on?

480
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,303
Someone's coming. Everyone, hide.

481
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,806
Well, that's strange.
I should have heard them approaching.

482
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,570
- Invasion?
- What's that, Aquaman?

483
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:43,491
Well, Wonder Woman,
I communicate with aquatic life fluidly,

484
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,076
but I also speak a little cat.

485
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:49,414
They're readying for an invasion,
or something about kitty litter.

486
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,375
- It could go either way.
- Of course.

487
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,169
That's Dex-Starr, the Red Lantern cat.

488
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,046
It's all so clear now.

489
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,258
Atrocitus and Ocean Master
are using the Sea Gate in Atlantis

490
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,053
to bring an armada
of rage-fueled battle machines to Earth.

491
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,558
Impossible! The Sea Gate isn't designed
to be able to transport an army!

492
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:12,603
That will take more power than
is available to... Well, anyone.

493
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,022
Speaking of power,

494
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:18,192
I'm detecting a huge energy surge
coming from somewhere in this room.

495
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:21,571
- Like that one!
- The orb from Area 52.

496
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,781
That's what's powering the Gate!

497
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:28,536
Now, Atrocitus can use Atlantis as
a beachhead to attack the surface world.

498
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,372
Ingenious! They've taken my crown,

499
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:34,042
my kingdom,
and now, the peace I've maintained

500
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,419
between the two realms I call home.

501
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,171
I must get back there!

502
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,549
We're not getting anywhere with all these
robots between us and the Sea Gate.

503
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:44,761
This looks like a job for Superman!

504
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,517
I don't understand. My powers, they're gone!

505
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:55,229
Worry about that later, Superman.
Here they come.

506
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:17,085
Yet another handy tool from
my all-purpose Utility Belt.

507
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,671
Oh.

508
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,257
They must have some automated repair system.

509
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,136
Cyborg, can you disrupt them?

510
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,139
Hold on to your ears. It's sonic cannon time!

511
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,230
Oh, man!

512
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,527
By the hairballs of Hades,
that is one furious feline!

513
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,699
Okay, Clark, you've got this!

514
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,456
Wonder Woman, are you all right?

515
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,168
But, Mother,
all the other kids' jets are visible!

516
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:02,130
Apparently, Wonder Woman
has been knocked silly.

517
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,674
- Are you sure?
- Bi-ba-ba-ba-ba!

518
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,092
Yeah, I'm sure.

519
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,723
Oh. Hello there.

520
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,809
You're a space dolphin, aren't you?

521
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,520
Yes, I know of your species.

522
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,732
Let me use my telepathic abilities
to ask you for help.

523
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:29,532
What? I would
never say something about your mother!

524
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,285
My telepathy must not be working
on dolphins from space.

525
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,331
That is one angry space dolphin.

526
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,833
We're completely outmatched.

527
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,502
- We have to get out of here.
- Leave that to me.

528
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,005
This should buy us some time.

529
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,682
- Amazing!
- In here!

530
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,814
Ha! Looks like you can't get in here!

531
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,651
- Nyeh, nyeh...
- Haha. Right. Why is he smiling?

532
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,907
Whoa! Is anyone else hot in here?

533
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,451
I thought it was just me. I'm burning up!

534
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:14,952
Burned up...

535
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,873
That's why this room is decorated
exactly like the inside of a furnace...

536
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,958
Because it is a furnace!

537
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,587
A furnace! What are we gonna do?
We need to get out of here fast!

538
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,048
Without my powers,
I can't fly us out of here.

539
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,425
And my rocket boots are still waterlogged.

540
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:32,678
My head is beginning to clear.
All I have to do is...

541
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,684
It appears my grapple
can't reach the top of the smokestack.

542
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,563
I love cheese, but it doesn't love me.

543
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:47,401
Yeah. Anyways, we just
have to be like jellyfish.

544
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:52,823
Batman, you don't happen to have a Bat
parachute in your Utility Belt, do you?

545
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,787
There, it's simple.

546
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,623
Heat rises and with it, so should we.

547
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,377
- It's working.
- But not enough. Look!

548
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,090
I don't know if we're gonna make it!

549
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,814
We made it! Hey!

550
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,900
Didn't you say the Sea Gate
went to other water-covered worlds?

551
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,860
It's supposed to.

552
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,405
It feels almost as hot out here as in there.

553
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:35,157
Where have I led us now? Death Valley?

554
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,326
Nowhere near that close.

555
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:40,621
Look! A red sun!

556
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,958
No wonder my powers don't work.
We're on a different planet.

557
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:48,921
We aren't gonna last long out here
without finding civilization.

558
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:52,049
How did you fit that
and the parachute in your belt?

559
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,051
Bat secret. Now, come on!

560
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,847
I am so getting
a Utility Belt when I get home.

561
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:07,273
Mera, thank goodness! How did you find me?

562
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,859
I heard your voice coming through
the other side of the tunnel.

563
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,986
And look what I found!

564
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:16,157
Someone has secretly assembled
an entire armada in my kingdom.

565
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,202
There's enough stuff here for Atrocitus
to take over the surface world.

566
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:23,122
- We have to tell everyone.
- Why should we?

567
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,083
The surface world
has caused us nothing but trouble.

568
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,586
- They deserve destruction.
- But Aquaman said...

569
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:32,715
My husband? He's not even
brave enough to fight for his own crown!

570
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,468
<i>Perhaps try talking some sense into her?</i>

571
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,511
Mera, you have to fight it!

572
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,388
I'd rather fight you!

573
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,645
<i>A tactical retreat would be strongly advised.</i>

574
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:48,230
Maybe you surface-dwellers
should be destroyed.

575
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:50,358
Starting with you!

576
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,529
Don't! I mean, stay back!

577
00:35:55,613 --> 00:36:00,326
You think the Queen of Atlantis is going
to be afraid of the chicken of the sea?

578
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,580
Ha! You missed!

579
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,290
I wasn't aiming for you.

580
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,336
Argh! Argh!

581
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,922
<i>Plus 10 for ingenuity.</i>

582
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,842
Let's hope those flying lessons
from Hal paid off!

583
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:28,688
Hey, guys, is it just me,
or is this sand really soft?

584
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:33,442
It's like we're walking on water. Yes, water!

585
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:37,405
Water! Look, water!

586
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:43,911
Come on in, guys! The water is perfect!

587
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,956
It's happening faster than I thought.

588
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,251
The lack of water
is causing him to hallucinate.

589
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,587
I don't feel so good.

590
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,632
Step back.

591
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:00,094
Let me use some of my Bat
smelling salts to try and revive him.

592
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,139
Your Utility Belt is almost
as great as you are.

593
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,807
Almost. Now, stand back.

594
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,021
He's stiff as a board.

595
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,816
Even if I had my super strength,
I don't think I could move him.

596
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,151
Let me try.

597
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,281
Interesting.

598
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:24,076
- Interesting how?
- Wonder Woman, can you lift him?

599
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,291
Strange, it's as if his body
is pulling towards something.

600
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,294
If I had to guess,
I think his Atlantean physiology

601
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,588
draws him naturally to water.

602
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,382
He is a human divining rod.

603
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,092
So, what should we do?

604
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,303
Follow his lead.

605
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,111
Ah, Mera.

606
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:04,408
Rah! Rah! Back off, tadpoles!
I'm the Queen of Atlantis!

607
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,076
The former Queen.

608
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,164
Oh. About that collateral
dethroning, sorry. Not sorry.

609
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,541
But now, that you've seen
the light of my leadership,

610
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,586
how do you wish to serve me, hmm?

611
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,090
Those surface dwellers,
they really rub my scales the wrong way.

612
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:24,595
- I'm glad to hear it.
- If I may, My Liege?

613
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,682
We have a perfect position in Stage Two.

614
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:32,228
As per our mutually beneficial arrangement.

615
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:39,109
Go! Take the surface world
for your new master!

616
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:44,198
The surface world
and Aquaman will feel my rage!

617
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,547
- I love Star City Pier.
- More than you love me?

618
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,174
Mmm.

619
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,803
- Isn't this fun, Damian?
- Eh.

620
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,472
Oh, come on! It can't be that bad!

621
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:11,934
Barbara, all we're doing is
going around in a circle.

622
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,853
I'm not sure what's so exhilarating about it.

623
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:17,690
This is why we took the day off
from being Batgirl and Robin.

624
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,359
You need to learn what it's like
to be a normal kid.

625
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:24,238
I'm a normal kid. I do kid things.

626
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:28,534
Like what? You don't play video games,
stay up late past your bedtime.

627
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,327
You don't even talk like a kid.

628
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,956
- Do, too!
- Do not! What are you doing?

629
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,084
Accessing Bat database.
Searching "kid behavior."

630
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,670
Speed reading, and done!

631
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,964
You want me to act like a kid, you got it!

632
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,717
Totes legit and killin' it.

633
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,927
- Huh?
- Take a chill pill, B.

634
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:50,180
This is gonna be G to the double-O D.

635
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:51,640
Oh, what have I done?

636
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,933
Selfie!

637
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:01,025
Shiver me timbers! I've caught one already!

638
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:05,571
Now, what kind of fish is that?

639
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,698
Wonder what it tastes like fried.

640
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,871
It tastes like rage!

641
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:33,182
Looks like our day off just got called off.

642
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,726
Robin? Are you listening to me?

643
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,313
- Kids don't listen.
- Argh! Come on!

644
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,412
Hang in there, gang.

645
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:58,290
We'll take a break
once we get to the top of this ridge.

646
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:02,753
Oh, no! I'm starting to hallucinate.

647
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:07,257
You're not hallucinating, Superman.
I see it, too.

648
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:15,975
That's a funny name for a place.

649
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,060
You think we should go in and take a look?

650
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,980
Whoa!

651
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:22,147
Wonder Woman!

652
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,460
Ooh!

653
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,194
- What can I get you?
- Five waters, please.

654
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:12,948
Five waters? You guys
sure ain't from around here.

655
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:15,409
Let me see what I can pull up for you.

656
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:21,749
- Ah!
- Oh, yeah!

657
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:28,881
Sweet singing seahorses! That is
the best water I have ever tasted!

658
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,050
- I'll have another.
- Big spender.

659
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:34,511
- That's expensive stuff!
- Water is expensive?

660
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,765
Ever since the red guy
sucked all the water up. Oh!

661
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:39,600
Atrocitus was here?

662
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:42,144
If he took all the water
from this planet, then...

663
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:46,356
He might do the same to Earth!
We have to get back home and stop him!

664
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:51,070
Say, how you people
paying for this here water?

665
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:52,154
Uh...

666
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,493
Put it on my Batster card.

667
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,787
No credit. Klagthorps only!

668
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,705
What's a Klagthorp?

669
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,125
Sir, there has to be something we can
do around here to pay off our tab.

670
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:08,378
The only thing you can do is pay up, or else!

671
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:12,007
Or else what? I've lost everything.

672
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,384
My wife is mad at me,

673
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:17,012
the world thinks I'm a laughingstock!

674
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:23,977
You and I could be pals! To pals!

675
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:26,980
Huh?

676
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:31,985
- Is Aquaman okay?
- Aquaman is clearly dehydrated.

677
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:35,781
The lack of water in his system
is obviously affecting his temperament.

678
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:39,618
You are affecting my temperament, Batman!

679
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:41,245
All of you are!

680
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,040
Deadbeats, huh?

681
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:49,962
Well, I guess that means I have
to introduce you to my debt collectors!

682
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:55,843
Aquaman, look...

683
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,803
No, the only cure for a pity party

684
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,514
is to invite a little company over.

685
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,975
Oh, right. Wait. Huh?

686
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:08,313
You know, there was a time when
I could have paid for all this water.

687
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:13,694
Heck! I could have bought
this entire place, but no!

688
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:18,157
I had to go and give up my crown!

689
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:24,454
I just bowed and let Ocean Master
take the crown right off my head!

690
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:28,500
I mean, being a king
is a lot of pressure, you know?

691
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:33,630
And believe me, at eight tons per
square inch at the bottom of the sea,

692
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,133
I know pressure. I used to be King.

693
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,311
What's going on?

694
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:48,562
It appears the locals

695
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,314
are paying our tab.

696
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,191
All right!

697
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:56,695
Gee, Aquaman, that was great!
I mean, is there anything you can't do?

698
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:57,946
Yodel.

699
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:01,617
Something to do with how my gills
interact with my uvula.

700
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,623
Give it up for the Main Man!

701
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:09,458
Uh-oh.

702
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,089
How do I stop this thing?

703
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:19,676
- <i>Step one. Stop screaming!</i>
- Oh, great!

704
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,724
Ow! Ow! Ow!

705
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:28,810
Any landing you walk away from... Right?

706
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:32,064
<i>Correct. Plus two Lantern points
for survival.</i>

707
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,815
Only two? Sheesh!

708
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:36,401
Green Lantern?

709
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:43,825
Batgirl? Robin? What are you doing here?

710
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,998
Five points for the kid.
Zero for the old bat!

711
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,543
We were hoping for a day off.

712
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:56,546
But now,
Aquaman's Atlantean army is attacking?

713
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,215
What? No, no!

714
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:01,969
The Atlanteans are being controlled
by Atrocitus and his rage light.

715
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:04,513
We gotta get out of here
and find some other heroes.

716
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,765
There's no time. Look!

717
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:18,193
Destroy the surface dwellers! Attack! Attack!

718
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:19,653
Uh-oh.

719
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:26,285
Well, look what we have here.
Last time I saw you,

720
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:30,247
I made your friend here
look like a real billinbore.

721
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,165
Easiest money I ever made.

722
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:35,294
Money? Someone hired you to do that?

723
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:38,088
Yeah. Some guy named Puddle Prince,

724
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,381
or Lake Leader...

725
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,841
Ocean Master!

726
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:44,344
Yeah, that's the guy.
He asked me to grab some power orb

727
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:47,180
and humiliate Salty Britches here
in the process.

728
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:49,933
The orb that powered
the Red Lantern's Sea Gate.

729
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:53,937
Well, it doesn't matter if you were
hired or not. Theft is theft.

730
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:56,815
I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in.

731
00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:01,403
Whoa. Don't get your blankie in a twist.
I'm not here for a scuffle.

732
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,363
I'm looking for my friend, Fishy.

733
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:06,408
You wouldn't by chance have
seen my friend, would you?

734
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,161
I recognize him.

735
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,205
And I know where he is.

736
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:15,125
Then you're gonna tell me right now.

737
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,169
On one condition.

738
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,588
Are you crazy right now? Tell him!

739
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:22,049
The only condition is,

740
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,510
if you don't tell me,
I'm gonna pound you into minced fish.

741
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:28,805
Go ahead. I've got nothing else to lose.

742
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:33,018
But you'll never find out
where your pal Fishy is.

743
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,520
Mmm.

744
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:41,610
Mr. Jellyfish has a spine after all.

745
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:43,195
What do you want?

746
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,490
We want you to take us
to the Red Lantern factory

747
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:49,951
and figure out how to use
the Sea Gate to get us home.

748
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:54,289
That's the deal. Take it, or leave it.

749
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:55,582
Fine.

750
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:58,502
Deal.

751
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,421
Ew!

752
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:05,092
It looks like the King of Atlantis
has returned.

753
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,762
Bartender, I'll take one more water
for the road.

754
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:12,140
Sorry, pal. You guys drank the last of it.

755
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:14,768
Last of it? Don't be ridiculous.

756
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,979
I'm a human divining rod,
and I know where water is.

757
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:21,817
Why, there's a whole reservoir
right below your bar!

758
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,039
All right. Let's go.

759
00:48:36,123 --> 00:48:38,750
I only have room on my bike
for one more person.

760
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,585
How are the rest of you gonna get there?

761
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:46,341
I have an idea.

762
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:52,806
This is awesome!

763
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:56,643
- It feels like I can fly again!
- Smoother than my invisible jet.

764
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,187
It is mildly amusing.

765
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:01,022
Bat flip!

766
00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:10,740
<i>The invasion is going swimmingly.</i>

767
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:13,660
<i>Mouth-breathers have finally run out of air,</i>

768
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,873
<i>as Atlantean ships give
them a taste of their own pollution!</i>

769
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:22,377
<i>Nothing can stop us,
as we rage against the 29% of the Earth</i>

770
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:26,256
<i>that hordes 100% of our resources!</i>

771
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,467
<i>Poseidonspeed, friends!</i>

772
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,888
<i>Bring us back a whopper
to hang above the throne!</i>

773
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,392
I love this show!

774
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:40,645
Now, to begin Stage Three.

775
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:43,273
Wait, we only talked about two stages.

776
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:48,403
- Is Stage Three...
- Oh. Didn't I tell you?

777
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:53,200
I'm using the Atlanteans
to help me assemble a new weapon,

778
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:57,120
one that will quell
any resistance on the surface world.

779
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:00,957
Ooh! That sounds really neat.
What does it do?

780
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,626
You'll see soon enough.

781
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:07,464
Besides, the king needn't bother
with the affairs on the surface.

782
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:11,134
Ah. That is the deal we made.

783
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:15,805
I rule everything underwater,
while you handle everything on dry land.

784
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:21,102
- All right. Carry on.
- As you wish.

785
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:42,123
Just as we promised, Mr. Lobo.
There's your friend.

786
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,418
Fishy!

787
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,548
So much for the element of surprise.

788
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:53,009
- Attack for justice!
- Wait for me!

789
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:55,345
Is there a ladder, or... Ooh! Good.

790
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,894
Get back here, you tin boxes!

791
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:10,902
Factory robot? Try unsatisfactory robot!

792
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:15,532
You make me wish I was a dog person.

793
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:37,012
Fishy! I was so worried about you!

794
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,723
You disappeared,
and I didn't know where you went.

795
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,360
The orb must be powering the entire facility.

796
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:54,070
Hurry! The Gate is closing.

797
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:02,329
All right, I'm here! For justice...

798
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,623
Uh, and the Gate is closed.

799
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:13,715
I can't believe Fishy did that.
He poked me in the eye.

800
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:17,177
- And hit you with his tail.
- And hit me with his tail!

801
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,012
Not helping, Cyborg.

802
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,099
Listen. Listen...

803
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:28,021
Friendship, like anything worth having,
is worth fighting for.

804
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:31,191
Come with us. Help us free Fishy

805
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,778
and the rest of those
under the Red Lantern's control.

806
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:37,322
No! No!

807
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:41,660
The Main Man ain't gonna crawl back
and beg to be anyone's friend.

808
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:45,038
- But...
- No! This is your fight.

809
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:52,379
I'm done! I don't need any friends!
I don't need anything!

810
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:57,926
I did not see that coming.

811
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:00,553
We have to get home to fight Atrocitus' army.

812
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,055
But how?

813
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,602
Hmm. I've got an idea!

814
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:23,576
Hey, my hot dogs! Oh!

815
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:26,538
Whoa!

816
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:31,209
Us against the establishment!
Fight the power!

817
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,169
I love the enthusiasm!

818
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,215
Fly swatter!

819
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:43,138
I know. I know. It's not a fly swatter.
Quit judging me!

820
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,931
<i>This is Lois Lane, reporting live.</i>

821
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,516
<i>With the rest of
the Justice League still missing,</i>

822
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,435
<i>the only defense against this invasion</i>

823
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:51,062
<i>are Robin, Batgirl,
and the new Green Lantern!</i>

824
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:54,232
The whole world is now watching
to see if they can pull it off!

825
00:53:56,025 --> 00:54:00,905
The whole world, watching... This is crazy.

826
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,661
- Green Lantern, are you okay?
- This is a mistake.

827
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:09,330
We need to leave. We have to go!

828
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:11,374
Green Lantern, come back!

829
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:23,636
Now, surface dwellers,
feel the rage of Atlantis!

830
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:43,156
Well, I got the Gate working again.

831
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:47,285
- How'd you guys do?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

832
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:54,334
Mount up! It is time to show them
what the Justice League can do!

833
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:57,629
Yeah!

834
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,259
So many eyes judging me,
everyone in the world watching me!

835
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:06,012
I can't handle this. I need help.

836
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,181
Oh, look, I can't do this alone!

837
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,975
Ring, show me all superheroes closest to me!

838
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:17,649
<i>Whatever she's doing to them,
they can't last much longer.</i>

839
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:31,579
Oh, this is the best!

840
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:35,959
No wonder Aquaman wanted to be King.
You get to do whatever you want!

841
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:40,129
You and I, Atrocitus,
are the unmatched rulers of this world!

842
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:43,758
I wouldn't be so sure of that, brother!

843
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:11,536
Impressive. But your pathetic machines

844
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:14,914
are no match for my Red Lantern rage!

845
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:24,299
You're all bark, and no bite!

846
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,385
Time for a cat nap!

847
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,225
Stop it!

848
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,852
You're supposed to be peaceful creatures.

849
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,604
There's nothing peaceful about you.

850
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:43,401
Your machines can't shield you
from my Lantern light forever.

851
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:51,326
Lighten up, Atrocitus.

852
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:56,748
Enough! You can't stop Atrocitus!

853
00:56:56,873 --> 00:57:01,461
My central battery is full
from the rage of this planet,

854
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:06,883
and has rendered me all-powerful!

855
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:09,886
We have to destroy that battery.
Come on, team!

856
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:35,286
Brother, stop this madness now!

857
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,413
Never! I'm King!

858
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:42,877
My friends!

859
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,731
Ha-ha!

860
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:06,109
Where is your hope now?

861
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,695
Yeah, where's your hope?

862
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:13,408
I assume now, you'll try and take us
over with your Red Lantern rage.

863
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,369
All in good time, but right now,

864
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:20,915
you have a front row seat
to the destruction of your planet.

865
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:23,543
Yes! The destruction of...

866
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:26,713
- Say what now?
- Stage Three is ready.

867
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,589
Witness the power

868
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:34,137
of the Submerged, Limitless,
Underwater Rapid Pump!

869
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:38,474
The S-L-U-R-P? Slurp?

870
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:41,644
You must have tried really hard
to make that one work.

871
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:13,801
<i>The SLURP takes in water,
vaporizing it into outer space,</i>

872
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:18,264
<i>until the world is left as dry as a desert.</i>

873
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:23,770
A world without water, and it's all my fault!

874
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:27,857
But you said I would rule the oceans
and you would rule the dry land!

875
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:31,444
You didn't really think
I would share my kingdom

876
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:35,198
with a sniveling brat such as yourself?

877
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,915
Poor little Orm!

878
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:46,834
Always caught in your brother's shadow.

879
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:51,506
Never happy unless you had
a piece of everything he had.

880
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,634
Well, now, you can share in his failure.

881
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:59,806
You have the perfect seat from
which to watch the end of your world.

882
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:20,493
What? What do you think you're doing?

883
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,578
This isn't you, Mera!

884
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,289
- You have to fight it!
- Never!

885
01:00:40,138 --> 01:00:43,099
In brightest day, in blackest night,

886
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:46,144
no evil shall escape my sight.

887
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:48,938
Let those who worship evil's might

888
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:52,483
beware my power, Green Lantern's light!

889
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:14,380
Where... Where am I?

890
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:18,176
- Mera, are you okay?
- Green Lantern?

891
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:21,262
What am I doing here? Where is Aquaman?

892
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:24,640
- That was amazing!
- But all those people watching...

893
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:26,475
How did you overcome your stage fright?

894
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:28,811
When I saw you two in trouble,

895
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:32,231
I stopped thinking
about myself and just reacted.

896
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:35,526
<i>I'm very proud of you,
Green Lantern Jessica Cruz.</i>

897
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:39,447
<i>You have now unlocked
the mute option. Engage.</i>

898
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:43,117
Funny. Now that I can, I don't want to.

899
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:45,411
<i>I fear I am blushing.</i>

900
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:48,414
- So is it over?
- Not quite. Look!

901
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:59,050
I really messed up.

902
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,344
Ormi, how can I help?

903
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:05,932
You still care, after all I've done to you?

904
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:07,016
Why?

905
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:12,063
Because like it or not, we are family.
And family has to stick together.

906
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:16,108
You're right. You've always been right.

907
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,986
I have so many regrets.

908
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,822
Me, too, brother. Me, too.

909
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:24,659
I just wish I was a better hero.

910
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:28,829
I know I'm not the flashiest
League member, or the greatest king.

911
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:32,375
I thought if I just faked it,
I would make it.

912
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:36,379
Instead, I've let everyone down.

913
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:40,967
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

914
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,053
That's kind of you to say,
but if I hadn't given up my crown,

915
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,972
none of this would be happening.

916
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,598
They would have found another way.

917
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:51,978
You are a great king, Aquaman,
and a great hero.

918
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,273
It was you that got us out of
the palace through the secret tunnels.

919
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:58,901
You helped us escape the smokestack
and led us to The Watering Hole.

920
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:01,320
You stood up to Lobo and got us back home.

921
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:04,824
The fact is, we've taken
you for granted, Aquaman.

922
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:08,953
If anyone can lead us to victory, you can.

923
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,957
You guys are the best.

924
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:17,545
Stand back!
The King of the Sea has work to do!

925
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:26,053
- Is he meditating?
- No. He's calling for help.

926
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,138
Huh?

927
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:28,431
What is that?

928
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:31,809
It looks like tiny, microscopic plankton.

929
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:36,731
Correct, Superman.
They are the key to our escape.

930
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,028
Thank you, my friends.

931
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:43,988
Let's do this!

932
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,407
Wait, if we got out there like this,

933
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,826
we'll be infected by the Red Lantern rage.

934
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,786
Let me handle that.

935
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:00,129
Excellent. My magic should safeguard us
from the effects of the Lantern.

936
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:05,551
Brilliant! Now, I'll handle Atrocitus.
You try to stop that machine.

937
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:09,013
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry. I've got his back.

938
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:11,349
- Together, brother?
- Together!

939
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,897
Okay. Try it now.

940
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:28,157
Argh! The shielding is too thick!

941
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:32,119
We're never gonna be able to do this.
We're gonna need a miracle.

942
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,707
Batman! The Justice League!

943
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:49,261
Oh! Beautiful sunshine.
I feel better already.

944
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:53,057
Oh! Am I ever glad to see you!

945
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,518
We're glad to see some
reinforcements up here.

946
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:59,814
Thanks to Green Lantern. Without her,
I'm afraid we'd be dead in the water.

947
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:04,318
Batman, where is Aquaman? Where is Arthur?

948
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,951
It is over, Atrocitus.

949
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:17,373
What?

950
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:25,172
Take this, you slimy oaf!

951
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:29,468
Brother!

952
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,222
No!

953
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,359
It's time to sleep with the fishes.

954
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,369
Poisedon's Trident!

955
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:59,874
For the one who is worthy!

956
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:11,177
Enough parlor tricks! Prepare for doom!

957
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:14,680
For Atlantis!

958
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,145
For the world!

959
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,540
No!

960
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:45,920
Huh?

961
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:02,019
Now it is finally over, Atrocitus!

962
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:06,732
For your world. Unfortunately for you,

963
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:10,194
the SLURP has already been activated,
and cannot be stopped.

964
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:14,448
All your precious water
is about to be sucked into oblivion.

965
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:16,742
There has to be a way to stop it.

966
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:21,914
If there is, I'm sure you could find it.
Go! I'll restrain Atrocitus.

967
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:25,334
You have a world to save, my King.

968
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,428
Ocean Master, let us...

969
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:39,974
I think we've heard enough from you!

970
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:45,813
This is Lois Lane reporting live from
above the water just outside Star City,

971
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:49,858
where a giant slurping device
is dropping the ocean's water level

972
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:51,485
at an incredible speed.

973
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:55,406
So far, the Justice League seem
to be unable to dismantle the device.

974
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:01,870
It's no good. Not even
my heat vision can penetrate it.

975
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:07,209
What are we gonna do?

976
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,378
I wish Arthur was here.

977
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:14,216
Arthur! You're okay!

978
01:08:14,425 --> 01:08:17,803
I'm fine, Mera. It's good to see you.

979
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:20,848
I'm sorry for the things I said.
I didn't mean it.

980
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,475
No, Mera. I apologize.

981
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:26,895
I didn't think about how
losing the throne would affect you.

982
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:32,943
You're my wife, my queen.
We rule Atlantis together.

983
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:38,866
Now, I believe it's time to save the planet!

984
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,076
I share your sentiments, Aquaman.

985
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,580
Unfortunately, our weapons
are ineffective against this SLURP.

986
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:48,042
By themselves, perhaps,
but we can't give up yet.

987
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:53,005
If we concentrate everything we have
on a solitary point at the same time,

988
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:56,342
then maybe we have a chance. Who's with me?

989
01:08:57,718 --> 01:09:00,638
I'm cheering for once. Hurray, or something.

990
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:03,557
Ready, Justice League?

991
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:05,851
Now!

992
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:26,038
- We moved it!
- Keep going! We can do this!

993
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,716
Fishy's right. We don't have enough power!

994
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,843
We need something more!

995
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,767
How about some more of the Main Man?

996
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,727
I'm back, baby!

997
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:55,150
Whoo!

998
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:57,736
I could never stay mad at you, Fishy!

999
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:59,113
Together!

1000
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:24,555
- Yes! All right!
- We're not done yet!

1001
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:53,041
It looks like the Justice League,
led by Aquaman,

1002
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,836
have destroyed the device and saved the day!

1003
01:10:56,837 --> 01:10:59,506
She's right, you know.
You did lead us to victory.

1004
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:02,843
I'd say it was more of a team effort.

1005
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:14,313
My good citizens of Atlantis,

1006
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:16,857
I have done you a great disservice

1007
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,611
by saying the law prevents
Aquaman from being King.

1008
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:24,031
In fact, the fine print was
something I put in there

1009
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:27,576
with the help of a clerk named Sal
at an all-night copy center.

1010
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,537
- There is no such law.
- Get off the stage!

1011
01:11:30,621 --> 01:11:33,373
And even if there were,
we can see he is worthy,

1012
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:37,711
because he pulled the Trident
of Poseidon from the great statue.

1013
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:41,340
So, Aquaman, my brother,

1014
01:11:41,423 --> 01:11:45,219
I give you back the crown
you so richly deserve.

1015
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,595
Thank you...

1016
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:00,317
Huzzah!

1017
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:06,907
Thank you. I promise to be the
best king and the best hero I can be,

1018
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,535
to Atlantis and the world!

1019
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,166
Now, let us dance!

1020
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,766
Wow. You Atlanteans really
know how to throw a party.

1021
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:34,726
Thank you, Cyborg.

1022
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:37,271
Well, I'm glad everything turned out okay.

1023
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,691
But what are we gonna do about the
Red Lanterns, Dex-Starr and Atrocitus?

1024
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:44,278
Leave them to me and Fishy.

1025
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:46,905
Turns out Oa placed a bounty on their heads,

1026
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:48,949
and I'm meaning to collect.

1027
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,202
This isn't the last you've
heard of me. I'll be...

1028
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,079
Ow!

1029
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,247
No!

1030
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,003
Thank you for your help, Lobo.

1031
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,629
Yeah, but let's not get mushy.

1032
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:07,217
Next time I see you yahoos,
I may not be on my best behavior.

1033
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:09,052
So long, chumps!

1034
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,477
Cyborg's mobile trouble alert!

1035
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:22,024
It looks like Gorilla Grodd is attacking
the city of Kathmandu in Nepal.

1036
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:25,193
Did someone say
high-altitude snowy mountains,

1037
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:28,113
nowhere near any ocean or body of water?

1038
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,617
That sounds like a job for Aquaman.

1039
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,579
Call if you aren't going to be home
for supper.

1040
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:38,957
Sure will. Well, what are we waiting for?

1041
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,751
People need our help!

1
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,616
OK  杰西卡   振作起来   你行的

2
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,414
哈尔正在放假期间   而你也是个绿灯侠

3
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,084
他让你去正义大厅顶班  没什么大不了的

4
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,377
你很冷静   很镇定  很有控制力

5
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>冷静  很镇定 很有控制力    嗯?</i>

6
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,762
闭嘴吧你   我可不记得哈尔的戒指和他说过话

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:58,392
<i>那是因为绿灯侠乔丹已经积累了足够的绿光能量</i>

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,686
<i>来解锁静音按钮</i>

9
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,312
戒指   启用静音模式

10
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>然而   你  绿灯侠杰西卡·克鲁兹    却没有 </i>

11
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,611
- 看来有麻烦了
- 哦   嗨   正义联盟

12
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,905
呃    我没碰它   我是说   我正要碰它

13
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,074
但我并没有没碰它   所以这不是我的错    我发誓 

14
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,201
而且大家都看着我    所以我现在应该闭嘴 

15
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,288
- <i>扣五个点绿光能量<i>
- 为什么?

16
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,541
- <i>别找借口</i>
- 别担心    绿灯侠

17
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,211
你没有做错什么    这是危险警报

18
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,964
- 它提醒我们当---
- 当有麻烦的时候?

19
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,800
是的   看到了吗？  你很有天分

20
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,428
露易丝·莱恩现场新闻

21
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,640
看来我们遇到真正的麻烦了

22
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,351
而且是以大写字母“L”为开头的家伙

23
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,856
露易丝有很多优点   蝙蝠侠     但我不会说她是个麻烦

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,816
不是露易丝  超人  你看  

25
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,944
这是露易丝·莱恩     来自52区恐怖湖的报道

26
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,698
银河系赏金猎人暴狼正在横冲直撞 

27
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,748
这简直就像是

28
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,125
大海捞针一样

29
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,754
现在已经废弃的52区设施

30
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,424
是为了简化军方复杂的机密外星科技部门

31
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,801
已经废弃？   我以为他们才刚建造好

32
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,138
简化程序反而使事情变得更加复杂

33
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,516
他们把所有的东西都搬到了新泽西州的一个新仓库里

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,691
你在哪里   你这个德比安星球的小混球?

35
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:33,195
暴狼    一个扎尼亚星人    超级强壮    超级强悍 

36
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,907
还有满口脏话    他似乎在找什么东西

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,701
现在还不知道暴狼会发现什么危险的神器

38
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,495
我们得尽快赶到恐怖湖边

39
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,121
<i>有人提到 "湖"字了吗?</i>

40
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,375
<i>为何听起来像是海王的工作!</i>

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,503
海王   你应该知道恐怖湖并不是你的---

42
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>哇   对不起  下面的信号有点不稳定</i>

43
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,050
<i>到时候见   海王下线 </i>

44
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:01,264
显然   他并没有按我的要求建造海底信号塔

45
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,726
我们真的应该在这里建一个海底信号塔

46
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,603
信号响应太糟糕了   奥姆

47
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:11,149
我告诉过你  哥哥     我更喜欢被称为“海洋领主”

48
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,152
哦   对不起    海洋领主

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
别担心   
   你想叫什么我就叫你什么

50
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:22,494
哦    就是这个    水下飞机 

51
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,163
我们刚好给你详细检查了一下，陛下

52
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,749
你们的工作也做得很棒

53
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,545
你们太棒了    我很喜欢当你们的国王

54
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,424
要把它开到满是灰尘的陆地上      我还真有点舍不得呢

55
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:39,386
不   不   不   去吧     陆地那儿需要你

56
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,890
你不在的时候   我会处理好这里的一切   再一次

57
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,058
噢！

58
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,061
谢谢  小奥姆 

59
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,148
- 是"海洋领主"
- 好啦   好啦   好啦

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,400
虽然    你这个称号有点奇怪

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,278
因为毕竟我才是“七海之王”

62
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,071
但   呃    管它呢

63
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,907
我只是很高兴我们能从小争吵中走出来

64
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:04,202
努力帮助亚特兰蒂斯  不   帮助整个世界

65
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,204
同心协力 

66
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,417
是的  我喜欢团队合作

67
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:15,797
告诉媚拉我会回家吃晚饭     当国王真好

68
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,429
是吗?    我们很快就会见到

69
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,436
干什么？  回去工作 

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,445
好了   水下飞机   我们要去淡水区了

71
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,865
当正义联盟的朋友们遇到关于水方面的问题

72
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,868
需要我的帮助时    我感到非常欣慰

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,631
你在哪里?

74
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,675
你不可能永远躲着主角的

75
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,844
耶!

76
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,306
- OK   吉米   拍我
- 露易丝  这是个好主意吗？

77
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,683
普利策奖从来都不是靠好点子赢得的，吉米

78
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,060
快点    跟上

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,020
呃    这不是他们获奖的唯一原因吗？

80
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,066
暴狼      露易丝·莱恩     来自《星球日报》

81
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,027
啊   狗仔队

82
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,737
不    我是个严肃的记者

83
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,739
如果我是狗仔队

84
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,491
我就会批评你的衣着品味

85
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,952
- 太老土
- 什么?

86
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,666
女士   主角总是说  “黑色永远是最潮流的”

87
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,545
好吧    我说  主角马上就要感受到痛苦了    伙计

88
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,548
- 谁说的?
- 正义联盟说的 

89
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,216
吉米    趴下 

90
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,511
很高兴见到你   暴狼

91
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,931
我是海王   “七海之主”

92
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,976
“海豚保护者”   “亚特兰蒂斯国王”

93
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,812
- “飞机失事者”
-  “失事者”...

94
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,189
呃    我还不熟悉这个绰号

95
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,024
让我来搞定这个

96
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,281
再见了    你这个海底的乡巴佬

97
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,792
不    别这样     这些零件很重要

98
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,671
嘿    这是一驾定制的飞机    刚刚打过蜡

99
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,258
似乎海王是第一个

100
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,302
莫名其妙到达的正义联盟成员

101
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,512
尽管我们身处沙漠

102
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,057
呃    永别了   水下飞机  为了国王   你表现得很好

103
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,482
海王    我是《星球日报》的露易丝-莱恩

104
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,319
就像我们专业记者说的    你看起来真的很像

105
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,072
主角暴狼说的“把你的警告奉还给你”

106
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,074
不用担心   莱恩小姐

107
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,412
我要叫支援了  用我的心灵感应能力

108
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,708
召唤我的水族同胞   就在恐怖湖这里

109
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,085
但是   恐怖湖是一个干涸的湖床

110
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,007
好吧   那就有点难度了  是吧

111
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,511
那ABC几个计划---      不管了    我还是很强的

112
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,596
而且--- 啊?

113
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,104
噢     天哪 

114
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,356
那一定很疼

115
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,984
天哪   莱恩小姐       海王真的快被撕成碎片了

116
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,861
不要打脸   不要打脸 

117
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,447
走开   走开

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,658
救命 

119
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,746
你不该这样对待王室

120
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,457
是吗？    痛得气喘吁吁的王室吗？

121
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,627
这就是为什么   人们从不让鱼去做人类的工作

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,254
- 吉米   告诉我你都拍下来了
- 完完全全

123
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,298
但万一暴狼要来抓我们呢?

124
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,259
不要惊慌    吉米     正义联盟来了

125
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,269
这是英雄的时刻

126
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,898
你们想让我当超级英雄   真的吗？

127
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,235
在整个正义联盟面前?    在大家的注视中？

128
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,531
来吧   绿灯侠   否则你会错过我们超级酷炫的出场方式

129
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,158
哦    谁会想错过这个呢

130
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,128
- 吉米  用慢镜头拍摄英雄登场
- 哦  好的 

131
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,171
还有足够的时间来拍摄最精彩的戏分

132
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,177
现在投降吧  暴狼 

133
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,595
在你的星球    你也许很强

134
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,557
但在地球金色太阳的照耀下  我才是最强的---


136
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,603
投降?  主角是永远不会投降的 

137
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,442
我真的感觉到了

138
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,822
我们可能需要些帮助

139
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,992
啊!
我马上就出去了

140
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,369
暴狼就跟超人一样强?

141
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,706
- 天哪 
- 你说得没错  铁皮人 

142
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,376
你得更加努力才能搞定主角

143
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,089
也许蝙蝠侠可以用他可爱的小工具带里的东西阻止他

144
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,341
哦    不    她说出来了

145
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,760
哈 

146
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:16,264
干嘛   你们懂的     他的万能腰带     很可爱的

147
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,894
你是说我的多功能腰带     对于各种各样的工具来说

148
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,354
这是一个方便的存储空间 而且不会碍事 

149
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,899
像你说的可爱的小皮带能做到吗？

150
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,025
呃    有点

151
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,651
- 也许
- 你就是你  蝙蝠侠

152
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,279
- 我很抱歉  我只是想---
- 注意 

153
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,449
如果我们想成功   那就必须团结协作

154
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,243
各位    数到三下就行动    一...

155
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,163
嗯    好吧     别等我了 

156
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,040
- 二  ...
- 别再搞砸了

157
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,292
做个又大又强的东西

158
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,418
三  

159
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,548
一个保险箱?   啊  

160
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,093
<i>噢    多勇敢啊    绿光能量再扣一分</i>

161
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,101
哈    小孩子的把戏 

162
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,981
嘿     继续摇晃你的鱼鳍吧  水母先生

163
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,859
呃     水母实际上没有鳍

164
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,612
介意我带你去兜风吗?

165
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,703
超人    钢骨    快 

166
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:35,802
嘿   啊   所以   这就是你一直躲藏的地方

167
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,847
来爸爸这 

168
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,975
- 演出结束了  对吧?
- 最好是这样

169
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,227
我们都使出了浑身解数来对付他了 

170
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,025
如果这就是你们全部的本事    那你们最好再加点油了

171
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,987
不可能    他身上一点划痕都没有

172
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,364
绿灯     用你的全部能量打他

173
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,324
呃   OK

174
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,451
我做到了 

175
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,080
我并没有做到

176
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,959
我很想留下来继续玩      但我已经得到了我想要的

177
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,341
再见    废物联盟 !

178
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,260
快   别让他逃了 

179
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,180
耶      哈哈哈

180
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,391
- 逃得好
- 你们认为他来这里是为了什么?

181
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,520
我不知道      但不管是什么    都不可能是好事

182
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,898
嗯   有谁看到海王了吗?

183
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:34,027
- 帮个小忙     拜托 
- 别担心    我来救你

184
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,491
谢谢  小伙伴们   很高兴你们来了  我们真的挽救了局面

185
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,993
我说的对吗?

186
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,537
- 露易丝·莱恩  《星球日报》的
- 是的    我知道 

187
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,873
被暴狼羞辱是什么感觉？

188
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,500
再加上被正义联盟再一次拯救呢？

189
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:54,380
我是团队的一员    正义联盟的胜利就是我的胜利

190
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,257
所以    你不介意全世界都看到

191
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,677
亚特兰提斯的国王    像一条受惊的鱼一样逃离暴狼?

192
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,680
不   你这样说对鱼是不公平的

193
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,351
- 而且    呃    我并没有逃跑
- 露易丝      恕我冒昧

194
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,187
海王是正义联盟的重要成员

195
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,440
- 重要在哪方面?
- 现在    好吧    他...   呃...

196
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,277
- 他     呃 ...
- 别看着我   我是新来的

197
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,114
海王与海洋生物对话的能力是一项至关重要的技能

198
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,201
我相信他会非常有效地使用它

199
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,537
在将来的某个时候     在有必要的时候

200
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,539
好了   女士们先生们

201
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,459
海王的队友100%支持他

202
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,671
即使他的技能过于边缘化 

203
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,299
《星球日报》 露易丝·莱恩播报完毕

204
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:42,470
咔  大新闻    我们回去吧  今晚七点准时播出


205
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,389
我不会担心的   海王

206
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,058
现在没有多少人看网络新闻了

207
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,937
哦   我不担心
此外  亚特兰蒂斯没有有线电视

208
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,649
我只是很高兴我们终于聚在一起了

209
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,443
我们找个地方痛痛快快地庆祝一下怎么样？

210
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:01,781
或者  或者  或者我们首先要弄清楚为什么暴狼会在这里 

211
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,784
没有什么比苹果派更值得用来做庆祝食物的了

212
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,536
我能做出连上帝吃了都感动到哭的美味大餐

213
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,037
让我们去吃大肚汉堡吧

214
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,166
请允许我诚挚地邀请你们大家来亚特兰蒂斯

215
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,171
我们将在哪里庆祝我当七海之王的周年纪念日

216
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,009
我们要去亚特兰蒂斯了    这真是太棒了

217
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,178
海底自驾游   我爱大海

218
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,683
友好的鱼  和平的海豚  没有人看着你

219
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,857
<i>加5点绿光能量  奖励你做出了适合的交通工具   干得好 </i>

220
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,987
啊   大海 

221
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,158
已知的  最有趣的   水中生物的家园

222
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,827
除了你们     我是说---

223
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,538
哇    好多鱼 

224
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,709
是的  鱼  植物   我们这里什么都有

225
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,210
有冰冻酸奶吗?

226
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,630
没有   它们会在海水中融化   但是我们有五颜六色的岩石

227
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,343
还有   呃   呃 ... 珊瑚     我们还有珊瑚

228
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,511
珊瑚和岩石不是一回事吗?

229
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,099
差远了

230
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,518
这是我吗？还是水在变颜色?

231
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,272
好眼力  钢骨    红色和黄色波长的光

232
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,524
只能在水下走这么远

233
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,819
这就是为什么在这么深的地方所有的东西看起来都是蓝色和绿色的

234
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:26,491
喔    难怪   没有阳光让我感觉有点绿绿的

235
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:32,705
我们亚特兰蒂斯有治疗你晕船的方法

236
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,089
太美丽了

237
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:46,094
那是什么声音?
哦  抱歉   听起来像唱歌 

238
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,389
哦   那一定是欢迎我回来的歌声

239
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,476
我的人民总是喜欢在我回家的时候唱小曲 

240
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,147
亚特兰蒂斯人真的是地球上最善良的人   嘘    听 

241
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,032
<i>我们的国王 七海之王</i>

242
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,867
<i>最强大的英雄是他 </i>

243
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,869
<i>他一边游泳一边战斗</i>

244
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,746
<i>没有比他更伟大的英雄了!</i>

245
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,458
<i>鲨鱼  鲸鱼  风暴  都不是    最强大的英雄是他</i>

246
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,627
<i>他一边游泳一边战斗</i>

247
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,382
<i>他就是海洋之王   海洋之王就是他 </i>

248
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,345
- 他们真的很爱你  海王
- 谁不爱呢?

249
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,223
那个家伙是谁?  看起来很伟大

250
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,308
波塞冬国王

251
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,812
他手里拿着神秘的希望之戟

252
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,275
传说中   无论谁从雕像手中拔出三叉戟

253
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,570
就能当亚特兰蒂斯的合法统治者

254
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,947
- 就像亚瑟王的神剑 
- 什么神剑?

255
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,782
有人做到了吗？

256
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,410
不  这只是一个老掉牙的传说

257
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,622
虽然可以经常看到有小孩试图把它拔出来

258
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,915
瞧

259
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,002
- 我快就成功了 这是我的 
- 你能行的  你能行的

260
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,590
我们到了 

261
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,887
呃   问题是  我们在这下面怎么呼吸

262
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,598
我发明了一种特殊的蝙蝠水喷雾

263
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,809
能暂时氧化我们周围的水

264
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,980
哦  你在那些可爱的小袋子里放了喷雾

265
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,405
欢迎光临   请不要客气

266
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,867
就像我在墨西哥湾的海豚朋友说的那样...

267
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,415
大致翻译过来的是 ：“ 咪 卡萨 艾斯  苏 卡瑟 ”

268
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,043
亚瑟   你终于回来了 

269
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,879
媚拉   见到真是太高兴了

270
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,257
- 那个高个子美女是谁?
- 高个子?

271
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,468
我们乐高人不是都一样大小的吗？ 钢骨

272
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,804
这是我妻子  媚拉

273
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,390
等等  你结婚了?

274
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,771
我是说    当然    你结婚了     海王经常在说到你

275
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,566
嗯   很抱歉我一直没有机会跟大家见面

276
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,153
亚瑟不在时 我一直忙着完善我的手艺 

277
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,905
- 你的手艺?
- 是的

278
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,533
媚拉不仅是亚特兰蒂斯的王后

279
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,662
她还是个硬水魔法大师

280
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,581
- 哦    先做条鱼 
- 硬水?

281
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,626
- 就像水果硬糖那样吗?
- 哦  不 不  更厉害

282
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,212
看这个 媚拉 做条鱼

283
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,219
是不是很神奇？

284
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,639
哦   我的上帝  你是怎么做到的?

285
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,768
魔法   有了我的水系魔法  我可以变任何东西

286
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,939
- 这是辆车
- 再做条鱼

287
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,526
- 还有椅子
- 鱼 

288
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,737
你的鱼又来了  亚瑟

289
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,366
鱼  我每次都受不了

290
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,121
我很高兴你们都在这里

291
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,457
正好赶上为亚瑟举行的皇家宴会

292
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,167
请跟我一起参加

293
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,669
王座厅的宴会 

294
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,045
好的!

295
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,966
用餐时间到    是时候考验一下我的铁胃了 


296
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,677
王座大厅？你坐在宝座上？

297
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,679
哈    没什么大不了的

298
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,824
哦  天哪    我敢打赌这里的海鲜一定是最好的 

299
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,659
说得没错    钢骨

300
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,079
亚特兰蒂斯是海洋的烹饪中心

301
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,873
我相信你会喜欢的

302
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,043
今晚   我们将为您提供海苔汉堡

303
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,087
海藻意大利面和海藻沙拉 

304
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,798
海藻?  龙虾和螃蟹呢?

305
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,133
或者来点虾米?

306
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,427
当然不行 

307
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,473
在海底   所有的海洋生物都有充分的公民权利

308
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,017
但别担心  试试海藻沙拉

309
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,770
味道就像 糯 糯 糯 米
吃进 小 肚 肚 肚 里

310
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,276
哦   天哪    我真的很想吃龙虾

311
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,945
我的错

312
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,992
还有人听到什么了吗?

313
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,746
或者是我的超级听力有问题?

314
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,375
蝙蝠打嗝！不好意思        声音是从外面传来的

315
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,213
都过来     都过来     靠近点  靠近点

316
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,297
这真的太过分了!

317
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,507
这种情况会持续多久?

318
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,759
也许他这次会用什么东西让我们大吃一惊 

319
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,137
上次 他讲了三个小时    我还要给船打蜡呢

320
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,766
我来讨论一件非常重要的事情的

321
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,894
亚特兰蒂斯的命运!

322
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,189
- 海洋领主
- 谁是海洋领主?

323
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,776
七大洋中最咸的坏蛋 

324
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,569
他也是我异父同母的半个兄弟 

325
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,281
一旦你了解他   他真的没那么坏    来吧!

326
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,119
海洋领主是海王的亲戚?

327
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,455
我不记得他在申请表上写过

328
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,666
现在我必须更新他的档案记录了

329
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,045
你们说我们的国王很强大，但在陆地上

330
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,756
他只不过是一个笑话 

331
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,467
我在这里看到的  唯一的笑话  正在舞台上

332
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,973
真的吗?   我来问你们

333
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,934
如果国王不能打败陆地居民

334
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,604
那他怎么能保护海洋中的你们  嗯？

335
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,524
我不知道   他总是对我们很好

336
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,900
是吗?

337
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,406
请让我向我们敬爱的国王透露一些情况

338
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,118
<i>警告 </i>

339
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,453
啊 

340
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,539
绿灯侠  你在干什么?

341
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,374
戒指自动反应的

342
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,626
<i>侦测到愤怒值的增加</i>

343
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,173
那是什么?  发生了什么事?

344
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,634
就像我说的我们消失的国王...

345
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,887
消失的国王...

346
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,516
你怎么能追随一个人人都嘲笑的国王呢? 看 

347
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,529
胆小鬼     只会逃

348
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,199
胆小鬼?

349
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,453
正义联盟出现之前 是我一直在苦苦支撑大局!

350
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,415
最后  你怎么能相信一个 

351
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,210
只有半个亚特兰提斯血统的国王呢？

352
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,300
是的  我父亲是一个普通的陆地居民 

353
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,513
我必须重新更新他的档案文件

354
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,432
- 他不能当国王 
- 啊   这改变了一切

355
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:53,312
海洋领主  兄弟  这是什么意思?

356
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,731
这是我当年把你锁在浴室里的报复吗

357
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,817
我们进去谈谈吧

358
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,986
没什么可谈的   是时候采取行动了

359
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,281
你违反亚特兰蒂斯的法律太久了

360
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,243
法律?  亚瑟  他在说什么?

361
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,997
我证明给你看   你确实不应该成为国王

362
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,168
看   亚特兰蒂斯宪法

363
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,171
- 这能证明什么?
- 在那里  接近底部那里 那一行小字

364
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,924
在这  让我用我的超级视力看看

365
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,011
哇    那个   太小了

366
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,222
我可能需要一个放大镜才行

367
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,351
我的多功能腰带还有另一个优点

368
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,104
让我们来看看  这上面说 

369
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:40,568
"要统治亚特兰蒂斯  你必须是血统纯正的亚特兰蒂斯人"

370
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,319
不   不 

371
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,656
我无法呼吸了!

372
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,074
但你可以在任何地方呼吸 

373
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,661
哦  说得对

374
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:55,124
所以  你瞧  兄弟  你不是合法的统治者

375
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,834
我才是 

376
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,045
海洋领主!  海洋领主!

377
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,383
海洋领主!  海洋领主!

378
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,760
亚瑟  你打算怎么办？

379
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,346
我只能做一件事

380
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,475
根据我已经宣誓效忠的亚特兰提斯法律 

381
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,147
在此 我把王冠让给我的兄弟

382
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,441
半个兄弟

383
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,194
好好统治吧 我的国王


385
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,906
别想拿回去

386
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,578
海洋领主!  海洋领主!  海洋领主! 


387
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,248
亚瑟   真不敢相信你把王位让给别人了

388
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,460
媚拉  我已经做了决定 

389
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:44,089
甚至没跟我商量   我们不应该是一个队的吗？亚瑟

390
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,966
- 媚拉  我---
- 不

391
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:50,179
这就是你想要的  好吧   没有我你也无所谓

392
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,727
哇   这一招真的好酷     她真的好厉害

393
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,230
太快了?   我的错

394
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,650
现在我是亚特兰蒂斯的国王

395
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,863
让我把你们介绍给那个鼓励我拿走我该得的东西的人

396
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,865
<i>威胁警报！检测到欧米茄能量</i>

397
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,158
喔    不 

398
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,534
我的皇家顾问

399
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,413
还有全能的好人

400
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,712
阿托希塔斯

401
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,965
<i>执行防御策略  欧米茄五级戒备</i>

402
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,265
这是你的防御策略?
一个沙发什么也做不了!

403
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,517
啊 

404
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,726
谁是阿托希塔斯?

405
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,063
<i>阿托希塔斯  红灯军团的首领</i>

406
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,775
<i>他们能用愤怒的力量控制心灵 </i>

407
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,277
<i>我建议快点离开</i>

408
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,238
哈尔曾提到过红灯军团

409
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,866
他们用红灯的愤怒能量  感染了亚特兰蒂斯人 

410
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,996
看来是绿灯侠的防护罩  在保护我们不受红灯的伤害

411
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,961
你们好  水下居民们

412
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,673
作为你们的新皇家顾问

413
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,259
我的第一条建议是

414
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,220
消灭正义联盟

415
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,806
- 摧毁他们!
- 抓住他们!  抓住他们!

416
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,974
这个穿披风的是我的!

417
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,061
快滚出来!

418
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,565
我不知道我的防护罩还能撑多久

419
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,774
<i>快撑不住了</i>

420
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,360
不知怎么的  我觉得出去揍他们是不对的

421
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,698
不能这么做  我虽然已经不是他们的国王了   但他们仍然是我的子民

422
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,117
我们必须撤退  然后制定一个计划

423
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,037
我知道一条出路  但我们需要分散他们的注意力

424
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,792
幸运的是  我的超级实用腰带正好有这个东西

425
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,297
墨水炸弹  太巧妙了

426
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,175
你看到他们去哪儿了吗?    他们去了哪里？

427
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,764
找到他们     他们不可能走得太远

428
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,475
你做得很好 海洋领主

429
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,603
你的意思是“海洋领主大王” 

430
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,564
是的  当然了  陛下 

431
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,108
我用红灯的愤怒力量

432
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,695
感染亚特兰蒂斯人的计划似乎奏效了

433
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:17,159
最后  整个亚特兰蒂斯终将臣服于我 

434
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,370
现在开始第二阶段

435
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,961
这些秘密通道只有王室才知道

436
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,007
如果我们迅速采取行动  也许能在被发现之前逃出去

437
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,510
怎么逃?  我相信他们已经把王宫包围起来了

438
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,304
- 海之门   当然了
- “海”什么?

439
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,556
看啊 

440
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,188
那是什么?

441
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,607
那就是海之门

442
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,110
它可以打开一个跨维度通道

443
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:55,322
能沟通亚特兰蒂斯和其他有水的行星 

444
00:26:55,405 --> 00:27:00,369
哦  我不知道亚特兰蒂斯的科技竟如此先进

445
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,704
更新档案文件

446
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,414
我想他们在这下面

447
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,126
海王    你一定能做点什么

448
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,503
嗯  我不知道怎么切换定位

449
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,381
但我可以打开它最后一个去过的地方

450
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,805
- 让我们行动起来 小伙伴们
- 你们先走   我留下来关门

451
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,267
我不能丢下我的人民  留在这个可怕的困境中  还有媚拉

452
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,894
如果你现在不来   你就没办法拯救你的人民了

453
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,734
杰西卡   快点   他们来了

454
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,363
但这会通向哪里呢?  如果那边有更多的人

455
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,657
望着我指指点点呢?

456
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,119
<i>这种可能性大约是17亿分之1</i>

457
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,787
所以  你是说有这种可能?

458
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,915
绿灯  没时间了想这想那了  快点

459
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,375
他们在那里 

460
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,377
等等  不要 

461
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,755
我是说 "不要"       不是说 "甜甜圈" 

462
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,182
<i>扣五点绿光能量  因为发音不清楚 </i>

463
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,602
他们逃脱了   通知阿托希塔斯

464
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,188
- 在这里!
- 在这里!

465
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,607
<i>威胁逼近 </i>

466
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,483
我好像听到什么了

467
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,235
真是谢谢了   你这个大嘴巴

468
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,697
<i>快点  远离你的麻烦 这似乎有所帮助</i>

469
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,909
死路一条   哦  不    我该怎么办？

470
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:25,913
<i>是的  如果你拥有宇宙中最强大的武器就好了...</i>

471
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,789
<i>哦   等等...</i>

472
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,334
拜托  戒指  帮个忙怎么样？

473
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,544
<i>你必须克服你的恐惧</i>

474
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,254
- 我不行 
- 你行的 

475
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:38,675
<i>我挑选新兵的记录一直很完美  直到现在</i>

476
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,178
好吧  祝下一位候选人好运 

477
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,682
哇 

478
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,814
搞定了 

479
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,901
从我自己的王国逃跑

480
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,488
- 无法容忍 
- 我们在哪?

481
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:04,284
看起来像某种工厂  但是他们在做什么?

482
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,620
更重要的是  绿灯侠在哪里？

483
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,666
不幸的是  这次危机证明她经验不足

484
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,670
她有点太嫩了  我们得回去找她 

485
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,214
海王   你能把海之门重新打开吗？

486
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
重新打开?

487
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,302
有人来了   大家快躲起来

488
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,805
好吧     真奇怪    我应该能听到他们走近的

489
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,569
- 武装入侵?
- 那是什么？ 海王

490
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,490
好吧    神奇女侠  我能和海洋生物交流

491
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,075
但我也会说一点猫的话

492
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,413
他们正在为入侵做准备     或者猫砂什么的

493
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,374
- 不论发生哪一种情况
- 当然了

494
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,168
那是灵星    红灯猫

495
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,045
现在一切都很清楚了

496
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,257
阿托希塔斯和海洋领主在亚特兰蒂斯使用海之门

497
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,052
将一支由愤怒驱动的战斗机器组成的舰队带到地球上

498
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:08,557
不可能的     海之门的设计初衷并不是为了运送军队

499
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,602
这将需要更强大的能量

500
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,021
说到能量

501
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:18,191
我发现一个巨大的能量波从这个房间的某个地方涌来

502
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,570
- 就像那样  
- 来自52区的球体

503
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,780
这就是驱动海之门的能量

504
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:28,535
现在阿托希塔斯可以利用亚特兰蒂斯作为滩头阵地来攻击陆地世界

505
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,371
太过分了  他们拿走了我的王冠 

506
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,041
我的王国    现在   还要打破

507
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,418
我的两个家乡之间的和平

508
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,170
我必须回去

509
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,464
这些机器人挡在我们和海之门中间

510
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,548
我们怎么过去？

511
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,760
这看起来像是超人该做的工作

512
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,516
我不明白你的意思    我的超能力消失了

513
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,228
以后再担心吧   超人    他们来了

514
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:17,084
这是我的万能腰带的另一个方便的工具

515
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,670
哦

516
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,256
他们一定有自动修理系统

517
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,135
钢骨    你能打乱他们吗？

518
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:30,138
捂住你们的耳朵     现在是声波加农炮时间

519
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,229
噢    天啊!

520
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,526
你这个哈迪斯的毛球     真是一只狂暴的猫科动物

521
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,698
OK   克拉克    你能行的

522
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,455
神奇女侠     你还好吗?

523
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,167
但是   妈妈   其他孩子的飞机都不是隐形的啊

524
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,129
显然    神奇女侠被打傻了

525
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,673
- 你确定吗?
- 哔-吧-吧-吧-吧 !

526
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,091
是的  我很确定 

527
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,722
哦    你好

528
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,808
你是一只太空海豚  是吧

529
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,519
是的   我知道你们的种族

530
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,731
让我用心灵感应来请你的帮忙

531
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,531
什么?   我永远不会说你母亲的事

532
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,284
我的心灵感应对太空海豚不起作用

533
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,330
这是一只愤怒的太空海豚

534
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,832
我们完全不是对手

535
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,501
- 我们得离开这里
- 那就交给我吧

536
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,004
这应该能给我们争取点时间

537
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,681
- 太神了!
- 在这里!

538
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,813
哈  看来你进不去了

539
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,650
 哈哈   没错   但它为什么在笑?

540
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,906
哇   大家不觉得这里很热吗?

541
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,450
我以为只有我觉得热     我都快着火了!

542
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,951
着火...

543
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,872
难怪这个房间装饰得像火炉一样...

544
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,957
因为它就是一个火炉 

545
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,586
一个火炉   我们该怎么办?    我们得快点离开这里

546
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,047
没有超能力   我就不能带大家飞出去

547
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,424
而且我的火箭靴还进水短路了

548
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,677
我的头脑开始清醒了  我要做的就是...

549
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,683
看来我的钩索也勾不到烟囱的顶端

550
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,562
我喜欢奶酪    但它不喜欢我

551
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,400
是的   无论如何   我们只要像水母一样

552
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:52,822
蝙蝠侠   你的万能腰带里有蝙降落伞吧

553
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,786
那儿      原理很简单

554
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,622
热量上升   我们也会跟着上升 

555
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,376
- 起作用了
- 但还不够    看啊 !

556
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,089
我不知道我们能不能撑过去

557
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,813
我们成功了     嘿  

558
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,899
你不是说海之门能通向其他有水的星球吗?

559
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,859
本来应该是这样的

560
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,404
这外面和火炉里面一样热

561
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,156
我把你们带到哪里了?   死亡谷吗?

562
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,325
离死亡不远了

563
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,620
看 !     红太阳

564
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,957
难怪我的超能力不管用了    我们在另一个星球上

565
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,920
没有社会文明的话    我们在这里撑不了多久的

566
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,048
你是怎么把降落伞绑在腰带上的?

567
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,050
这是蝙蝠秘密    快    走吧

568
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,846
等我回到家的时候   我也要做一条多功能腰带

569
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,272
媚拉     谢天谢地     你怎么找到我的？

570
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,858
我听到你的声音从隧道的另一端传来

571
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,985
看看我发现了什么

572
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:16,156
有人偷偷在我的王国里集结了一支舰队

573
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,201
这里有大量的武器让阿托希塔斯来侵略陆地世界

574
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,121
- 我们得告诉大家
- 为什么?

575
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,082
陆地世界给我们带来的只有麻烦 

576
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,585
- 他们应该被毁灭
- 但海王曾说---

577
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:32,714
我的丈夫吗?  他甚至没有勇气为自己的王位而战

578
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,467
<i>试着对她讲点道理看看</i>

579
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,510
媚拉    你必须对抗它

580
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,387
我宁愿对抗你

581
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,644
<i>强烈建议采取战术撤退</i>

582
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,229
也许你们这些陆地居民应该被消灭

583
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,357
就从你开始!

584
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,528
住手!    我是说   退后

585
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,073
你认为亚特兰蒂斯王后会害怕

586
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,325
你这个海里的弱鸡吗?

587
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,579
哈    你没打中

588
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,289
我不是瞄准你的

589
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,335
啊    啊 

590
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,921
<i>聪明    加10点绿光能量</i>

591
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,841
希望哈尔的飞行课能有点用

592
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,687
嘿    伙计们    只有我觉得   还是这沙子太软了

593
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,441
我们就像在水上行走    是的   水

594
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,404
是水    看啊    有水 

595
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,910
下来吧   伙计们     这水真太完美了

596
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,955
事情发生得比我想象的要快

597
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,250
缺水使他产生了幻觉

598
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,586
我觉得不舒服

599
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,631
退后一步

600
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,093
让我用蝙蝠嗅盐试着救活他

601
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,138
你的多功能腰带几乎和你一样神奇

602
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,806
差不多吧   现在    退后 

603
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,020
他僵硬得像块木板

604
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,815
即使我恢复超能力   我想我也搬不动他 

605
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,150
让我试试

606
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,280
真有意思

607
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:24,075
- 啥意思?
- 神奇女侠   你能把他举起来吗?

608
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,290
奇怪的是    他的身体好像在向什么东西靠近

609
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,293
如果要我猜的话     我想是他的亚特兰蒂斯生理机能

610
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,587
让他自然地被水吸引

611
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,381
他就是个人体探测器

612
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,091
那么   我们该怎么办？

613
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,302
跟着他走

614
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,110
啊   媚拉

615
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:04,407
汪   汪    退下   狗东西     我是亚特兰蒂斯王后

616
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,075
是前王后

617
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,163
哦    关于王后退位的事    抱歉    才怪 

618
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,540
但现在   你已经看到了我领导的能力

619
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,585
你想怎么为我效劳?  嗯

620
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:20,089
那些住在地面上的家伙   他们真把我惹火了 

621
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,594
- 听你这么说我很高兴
- 如果可以的话   陛下

622
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,681
我们第二阶段进展得很完美

623
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,227
按照我们双方的互利安排

624
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:39,108
去吧   为你的新主人   拿下陆地世界  

625
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:44,197
陆地世界和海王    会感受到我的愤怒的

626
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,546
- 我喜欢星城码头
- 多过你爱我吗?


628
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,802
-不好玩吗？达米安
- 哼

629
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,471
哦   拜托    不会那么糟吧 

630
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,933
芭芭拉   我们只是在绕圈子

631
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,852
我不知道这有什么可兴奋的

632
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,689
这就是为什么要放一天假   不当蝙蝠女和罗宾了

633
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,358
你需要学习怎样当一个普通的小孩 

634
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,237
我是个普通的孩子啊   我也会做小孩子的事

635
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,533
比如呢?  你不玩电子游戏  也不熬夜

636
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,326
你说话的样子都不像个孩子 

637
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,955
- 我像 
- 不像   你在做什么?

638
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,083
访问蝙蝠数据库      搜索“孩子的行为”

639
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,669
快速阅读    完成 

640
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,963
你想让我表现得像个孩子    没问题

641
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,716
图腾召唤   触发击杀

642
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,926
- 啊?
- 放松一下  小芭

643
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,179
这一定会从G到双O D

644
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,639
哦     看我都做了什么?

645
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:52,932
自拍 

646
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,024
让我颤抖吧    我已经钓到一条大鱼了 

647
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,570
那是什么鱼?

648
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,697
真想知道它煎起来是什么味道

649
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,870
尝起来像愤怒的味道

650
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,181
看来我们的休息日被取消了

651
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,725
罗宾?  你在听我说话吗？

652
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,312
- 小孩子不听话
- 啊   别闹了 

653
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,411
坚持住   伙计们

654
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,289
我们到了山顶上 就休息一下

655
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,752
哦   不    我开始产生幻觉了

656
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,256
你没有幻觉 超人    我也看见了


657
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,974
“水坑酒吧”  这地方的名字真有趣

658
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,059
你觉得我们应该进去看看吗？

659
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,979
哇 

660
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,146
神奇女侠

661
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,459
哦 

662
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,193
- 你要点什么?
- 请给我五杯水

663
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,947
五杯水?  你们肯定不是本地人

664
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,408
让我看看能帮你们拿些什么

665
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,748
- 啊 
- 欧 耶  

666
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:28,880
可爱的海马啊    这是我喝过的最好的水 

667
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,049
- 我要再来一杯 
- 真是土豪啊

668
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,510
- 这可是很贵的
- 水很贵吗？

669
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,764
自从那个红家伙把所有的水都吸了出来之后  是的

670
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,599
阿托希塔斯来过这?

671
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,143
如果他把这个星球上所有的水都拿走了     那---

672
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,355
他可能也会对地球做同样的事    我们必须回去阻止他

673
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:51,069
话说   你们这些人是怎么付钱的?

674
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,153
呃...

675
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,492
把帐记在我的蝙蝠信用卡上

676
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,786
不收信用卡    只收克拉托币 

677
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,704
克拉托币是什么?

678
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,124
先生    我们必须在这附近做点什么来付清我们的账单

679
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,377
你唯一能做的就是付钱   否则

680
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:12,006
否则什么?      我已经失去了一切

681
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,383
我妻子生我的气

682
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,011
全世界都认为我是个笑柄

683
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,976
你和我可以成为朋友     敬朋友 

685
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:31,984
- 海王没事吧?
- 海王明显已经脱水了

686
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,780
身体缺水显然影响他的心情

687
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,617
你影响了我的脾气   蝙蝠侠

688
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,244
你们都是

689
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,039
赖账不给？ 哈

690
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:49,961
那好   我想这意味着我得把你们介绍给我的讨债人

691
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,842
海王    你看---

692
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,802
不     挽救一个尴尬的聚会 唯一的办法 

693
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,513
是邀请更多的伙伴参与进来

694
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,974
哦     对哦    等等   啊  

695
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:08,312
你们知道的   曾经我可以付清所有这些水的钱

696
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:13,693
真见鬼     我甚至可以买下这整个地方  但是不行

697
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,156
我不得不放弃我的王冠

698
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:24,453
我只是鞠了个躬   让海洋领主把我头上的王冠摘下来

699
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,499
我是说    当国王压力很大   你们知道吗？

700
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:33,629
相信我    在海底每平方英寸有8吨重

701
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,132
我知道压力   我曾经是国王

702
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,310
发生什么事了?

703
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,561
好像是本地人

704
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,313
在帮我们付账

705
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,190
太好了 

706
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,694
哇    海王    太棒了     我是说    有什么是你做不到的吗

707
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,945
约德尔唱法

708
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,616
我的鳃和舌头不知道该怎么配合才好

709
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,622
鼓掌欢迎主角登场 

711
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,088
我该怎么阻止这个怪物东西?

712
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:19,675
<i>- 第一步    停止尖叫 </i>
- 噢   完了  

713
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,723
 嗷！  嗷！  嗷！

714
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,809
逃脱成功安全着陆... 对吧?

715
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:32,063
<i>正确   再加上两点绿光能量</i>

716
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,814
才两点      真小气

717
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,400
绿灯侠 

718
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,824
蝙蝠女     罗宾     你们在这里干什么?

719
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,997
给小孩子五分   老蝙蝠零分

720
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,542
我们希望能休息一天

721
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,545
但现在     海王的亚特兰蒂斯军队正在进攻

722
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,214
什么     不   不 

723
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,968
亚特兰蒂斯人被阿托希塔斯和他的愤怒之光控制着

724
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,512
我们得离开这里去找其他英雄

725
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,764
没有时间了    看

726
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:18,192
摧毁陆地居民   攻击   攻击


728
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:26,284
哟    看这都有谁呀  上次我见到你们的时候

729
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:30,246
我让你们的朋友出尽了洋相

730
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,164
我赚的过最容易的钱

731
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:35,293
钱?    有人雇你来做这事吗?

732
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:38,087
是啊     有个叫水坑王子的人

733
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,380
或者是叫湖泊领袖---

734
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,840
海洋领主 

735
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,343
是的   就是这家伙     他让我去拿能量球

736
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,179
然后在这个过程中羞辱一下这条咸鱼

737
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,932
就是这个球给红灯军团的海之门提供了动力

738
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,936
好吧   不管你是不是被雇用的   偷窃就是偷窃

739
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,814
恐怕我们得逮捕你

740
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,402
喔    别搞错状况   我不是来打架的 

741
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,362
我在找我的朋友  太空海豚

742
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,407
你们不会碰巧看见我的朋友吧 

743
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,160
我认识它

744
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,204
而且我知道他在哪里

745
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,124
那你现在就告诉我

746
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,168
有一个条件

747
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,587
你疯了吗？  告诉他

748
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,048
唯一的条件是

749
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,509
如果你不告诉我     我就把你捣成鱼酱

750
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,804
那就来呀   我没什么可失去的了

751
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:33,017
但是你永远也找不到你的朋友太空海豚了

752
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,519
嗯

753
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,609
水母先生毕竟还是有骨气的

754
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,194
你想要什么?

755
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,489
我们要你带我们去红灯工厂

756
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,950
想办法用海之门带我们回家

757
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,288
一言为定   要么接受  要么放弃

758
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,581
好吧

759
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,501
成交


761
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:05,091
看起来亚特兰蒂斯的国王回来了

762
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,761
酒保   我再拿一杯水上路

763
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,139
对不起   伙计   最后一点水都被你们喝光了 

764
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,767
最后一点水?  别傻了

765
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,978
我可是人体探测器      我知道水在哪里

766
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:21,816
为什么     你的酒吧下面就有一个蓄水池

767
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,038
好吧     我们走吧

768
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,749
我的摩托车上只能再坐一个人

769
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,584
你们其他人怎么去呢

770
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,340
我有个主意

771
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,805
真是太棒了

772
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,642
- 感觉我又能飞了
- 比我的隐形飞机还要平稳

773
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,186
这有点好笑

774
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,021
蝙蝠翻转 

775
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,739
<i>入侵进行得很顺利</i>

776
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,659
<i>他们就像是嘴巴呼吸不到空气了 </i>

777
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,872
<i>因为亚特兰蒂斯战舰让他们尝到了被污染的味道 </i>

778
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,376
<i>没有什么能阻止我们   向地球29%的人类</i>

779
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,255
<i>夺回属于我们100%的资源 </i>

780
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,466
<i>加快速度   朋友们 </i>

781
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,887
<i>给我们带个大的战利品来挂在王座上吧 </i>

782
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,391
我喜欢这个节目

783
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,644
现在   开始第三阶段

784
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,272
等等   我们只谈了两个阶段

785
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:48,402
- 第三阶段是---
- 哦    我还没跟你说吗?

786
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:53,199
我正在用亚特兰蒂斯人帮我组装新武器

787
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,119
它将平息地面上的任何抵抗 

788
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:00,956
呜    听起来真不错   它是做什么的？

789
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,625
你很快就会明白的

790
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:07,463
此外   国王不必为陆地上的事情操心

791
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,133
 这就是我们达成的协议

792
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:15,804
我统治海洋世界   而你统治陆地世界

793
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:21,101
- 好吧    继续工作 
- 如你所愿

794
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,122
就像我们承诺的那样   暴狼先生      你的朋友在那里

795
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,417
太空海豚 

796
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,547
令人惊讶的因素就这么多了

797
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,008
- 为正义而战 
- 等我一下 

798
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,344
有没有梯子    或者…    哦    好吧

799
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,893
回来  你们这些铁皮盒子

800
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,901
工厂机器人吗?     试一下我这先进机器人的威力

801
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,531
你最好企求我是个爱狗人士

802
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,011
太空海豚      我真的好担心你 

803
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,722
你不见了    我不知道你去了哪里

804
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,359
能量球肯定为整个设施提供电力

805
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,069
快点    大门正在关闭

806
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,328
好了    我来了   为了正义而...

807
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,622
呃    大门已经关上了

808
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,714
我不敢相信太空海豚会那样做    他戳了我的眼睛 

809
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,176
- 还用他的尾巴打你
- 还用他的尾巴打我

810
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,011
别帮倒忙   钢骨

811
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,098
听着      听着

812
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:28,020
友谊的小船  就像任何珍贵的东西一样    是值得为之奋斗的

813
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,190
跟我们来   帮我们解救太空海豚

814
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,777
还有那些在红灯军团控制下的人

815
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,321
不   不 

816
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:41,659
主角不会爬回去乞求成为任何人的朋友

817
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:45,037
- 但---
- 不   这是你的战斗

818
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,378
我不干了     我不需要任何朋友    我什么都不需要

819
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,925
我可没想到会是这样

820
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,552
我们得回去和阿托希塔斯的军队作战

821
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,054
但怎么回?

822
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:07,601
嗯   我有个主意

823
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,575
嘿   我的热狗   噢 

824
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,537
哇 

825
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,208
我们在对抗整个军队    打倒强权 

826
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,168
我喜欢这种热情

827
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,214
苍蝇拍 

828
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,137
我知道    我知道   这不是苍蝇拍    别怪我 

829
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,930
<i>我是露易丝·莱恩，现场报道</i>

830
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,515
<i>随着正义联盟其他成员的消失 </i>

831
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,434
<i>唯一能抵御入侵的</i>

832
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:51,061
<i>只有罗宾、蝙蝠女和新绿灯侠 </i>

833
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,231
全世界都在关注他们是否能成功

834
00:53:56,024 --> 00:54:00,904
全世界   都在看着……这是太疯狂了

835
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,660
- 绿灯侠   你还好吧?
- 这是个错误

836
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,329
我们必须离开  我们得走了

837
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,373
绿灯侠    回来 

838
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:23,635
现在   陆地居民们   感受亚特兰蒂斯的愤怒吧

839
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,155
好吧   我让海之门又恢复工作了

840
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:47,284
- 伙计们怎么样?
- 还不赖   一点都不赖

841
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:54,333
加油     是时候让他们见识一下正义联盟的厉害了

842
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,628
耶 

843
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,258
有那么多的眼睛在评判我   世界上的每一个人都在看着我

844
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,011
我应付不了这个  我需要帮助

845
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,180
哦   瞧   我一个人做不到

846
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,974
戒指    让我看看最近的超级英雄在哪里

847
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,648
<i>不管她对他们做了什么   他们都撑不了多久了 </i>

848
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,578
哦   这就是最好的

849
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:35,958
难怪海王想当国王     你想做什么就做什么

850
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:40,128
你和我  阿托希塔斯    是这个世界上无与伦比的统治者

851
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,757
我可不敢那么肯定    兄弟！

852
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:11,535
不错嘛   但你们可怜的机器

853
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,913
不是我的红灯怒火的对手 

854
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,298
你只会叫   不会咬人

855
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,384
该小睡一会儿了

856
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,224
住手

857
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,851
你应该是爱好和平的动物啊

858
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,603
可你一点也不平静

859
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,400
你的机器无法永远挡住我的红灯 

860
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,325
放轻松,   阿托希塔斯

861
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:56,747
够了     你们是无法阻止阿托希塔斯的

862
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:01,460
我的中央电池充满了来自这个星球的愤怒

863
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:06,882
 让我无所不能

864
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,885
我们必须摧毁那个电池    快点     小伙伴们

865
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,285
兄弟    别再胡闹了 

866
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,412
决不，我才是大王

867
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:42,876
朋友们 

868
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,730
哈---哈 

869
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,108
现在 你的希望在哪里?

870
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,694
是啊    你的希望在哪里？

871
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,407
我猜现在你会用红灯愤怒来控制我们

872
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,368
一切都很顺利    但现在

873
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:20,914
你们可以坐在前排观看地球的毁灭

874
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,542
是的     地球的毁灭...

875
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:26,712
- 你在说什么?
- 第三阶段准备好了

876
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,588
见证 这来自

877
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:34,136
深埋在海底的无限的超级水泵的力量吧

878
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,473
字母S-L-U-R-P ? 吞噬?

879
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,643
你一定是想了破头才想出这个称号吧

880
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:13,800
<i>吞噬机抽水   把水蒸发到太空中</i>

881
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:18,263
<i>直到世界变得像沙漠一样干燥</i>

882
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,769
一个没有水的世界  这都是我的错

883
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:27,856
但你说过  让我统治海洋   你来统治陆地

884
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:31,443
你不会真的以为我会跟你分享我的王国吧

885
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:35,197
和你这个爱哭鬼?

886
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,914
可怜的小奥姆

887
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,833
总是被你哥哥的阴影所笼罩

888
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:51,505
除非你拥有他的一切  否则你永远不会快乐

889
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,633
好了   现在   你可以分享他的失败了

890
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:59,805
你们现在已经有了完美的座位 来观看世界末日了

891
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,492
什么?   你以为你在干什么?

892
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,577
这不是你   媚拉 

893
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,288
- 你必须反抗 
- 绝不

894
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,098
在最亮的白天  在最黑的夜晚

895
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,143
任何邪恶都逃不过我的视线

896
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,937
让那些崇拜邪恶力量的人

897
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,482
畏惧我的力量   绿灯侠的光芒  

898
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,379
哪里 ...    我这是在哪里?

899
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,175
- 媚拉    你还好吧?
- 绿灯侠 

900
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,261
我在这里做什么?     海王在哪里?

901
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,639
- 这真是太神奇了
- 可所有的人都在看着 ...

902
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,474
你是怎么克服怯场的?

903
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,810
当我看到你们俩有麻烦的时候

904
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:32,230
我就不再考虑自己了    我要行动起来

905
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:35,525
<i>我真为你骄傲   绿灯侠杰西卡·克鲁兹</i>

906
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:39,446
<i>您现在已经解锁了静音模式  请用</i>

907
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,116
有意思    现在我可以了  但我反而不想要

908
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,410
<i>恐怕我都脸红了</i>

909
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,413
- 所以 结束了吗?
- 不完全是    看 

910
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:59,049
我真的搞砸了

911
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,343
奥米     要我怎么帮忙?

912
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:05,931
我对你那么过分   你还在乎我

913
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,015
为什么?

914
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:12,062
因为不管你喜不喜欢   我们都是一家人 
一家人必须团结在一起

915
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:16,107
你是对的    你总是对的 

916
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,985
我感到非常后悔

917
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,821
我也是     弟弟     我也是 

918
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,658
我只希望我是个更强的英雄

919
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,828
我知道我不是最耀眼的联盟队员    也不是最伟大的国王

920
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,374
我以为只要装作不在乎   我就能做得到 

921
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:36,378
相反    我让所有人都失望了

922
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,966
那是我听过的最可笑的事

923
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:44,052
你说的对    但是如果我没有放弃王位的话

924
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,971
所有的这一切这些都不会发生 

925
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,597
他们还是会找到别的方法得逞的

926
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,977
你是一位伟大的国王     海王    也是一位伟大的英雄 

927
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:55,272
是你让我们通过秘密隧道离开了宫殿

928
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,900
你帮我们逃出烟囱    把我们带到了水坑酒吧

929
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,319
你反抗暴狼    带我们回家

930
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,823
事实上    我们认为你是理所当然的    海王 

931
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:08,952
如果有人能带领我们走向胜利    那一定是你

932
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,956
你们是最棒的

933
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:17,544
退后      海洋之王还有工作要做

934
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:26,052
- 他是在沉思吗？
- 不   他正在呼叫支援

935
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,137
啊?

936
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,430
那是什么?

937
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,808
看起来像微小的浮游生物

938
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:36,730
没错   超人      它们是我们逃跑的关键（钥匙）

939
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,027
谢谢你们    我的朋友们

940
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,987
放手一搏吧

941
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,406
等等    如果我们像这样出去

942
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,825
我们会被红灯能量的愤怒感染 

943
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,785
让我来处理 

944
01:03:55,749 --> 01:04:00,128
太好了       我的魔法可以保护我们不受红灯的影响

945
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:05,550
精彩   现在   我来处理阿托希塔斯      你们去阻止那台机器

946
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:09,012
- 你确定吗?
- 别担心    我支持他

947
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,348
- 一起上   兄弟 
- 一起上

948
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,896
OK    现在试试看

949
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,156
啊      防护罩太厚了 

950
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:32,118
我们永远也做不到这一点    我们需要奇迹 

951
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,706
蝙蝠侠    正义联盟

952
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:49,260
哦        美丽的阳光         我已经感觉好多了

953
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,056
噢       我从没那么高兴地见到你们 

954
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,517
我们很高兴看到这里有增援部队

955
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:59,813
多亏了绿灯侠   没有她的话      恐怕我们已经死在水里了 

956
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:04,317
蝙蝠侠     海王在哪里?      亚瑟在哪里？

957
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,950
结束了     阿托希塔斯

958
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,372
什么?

959
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:25,171
尝尝这个     你这个粘糊糊的笨蛋 

960
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,467
弟弟 

961
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,221
- 不  

962
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,358
是时候和你的鱼一起沉睡了

963
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,368
波塞冬的三叉戟

964
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,873
为了那个有资格的人 

965
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,176
别耍花招了    准备迎接末日吧!

966
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:14,679
为了亚特兰蒂斯

967
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,144
为了世界

968
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,539
不

970
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:02,018
现在    终于结束了     阿托希塔斯

971
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:06,731
对你的世界来说是的   不幸的是对你来说

972
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:10,193
吞噬机已经激活  无法停止

973
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:14,447
你们所有宝贵的水都将被吸干

974
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:16,741
一定有办法地能阻止它的

975
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:21,913
如果有   我相信你会找到的      去吧    我来看住阿托希塔斯


976
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,333
你有一整个世界要去拯救   我的国王

977
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:36,427
海洋领主   让我们---

978
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,973
我想你说的已经够多了

979
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:45,812
我是露易丝·莱恩     在星城外的水上进行现场报道

980
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:49,857
一个巨大的吸管正在快速抽水 

981
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,484
海平面一直在以惊人的速度下降 

982
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,405
到目前为止    正义联盟似乎无法拆除这个装置

983
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,869
不太妙    就连我的热视线都无法穿透它

984
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,208
我们该怎么办?

985
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,377
我希望亚瑟在这里

986
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,215
亚瑟    你没事了

987
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,802
我很好    媚拉    很高兴见到你 

988
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,847
我为我说过的话感到抱歉     我真的不是那个意思

989
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,474
不    媚拉     我才要道歉 

990
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:26,894
我没想到失去王位会对你有什么影响

991
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:32,942
你是我的妻子   我的王后       我们一起统治亚特兰蒂斯

992
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:38,865
现在   我想是时候拯救这个星球了

993
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,075
我同意你的看法    海王

994
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,579
不幸的是      我们的武器对吞噬机无效

995
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:48,041
各自出招也许行不通     但我们不能放弃

996
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:53,004
如果我们同时把所有的力量都集中在一个点上

997
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:56,341
也许我们还有机会赢        谁想跟我来？

998
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,637
我只欢呼一次     万岁    还有    那啥的---

999
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,556
准备好了吗     正义联盟?

1000
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,850
上  

1002
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:26,037
- 已经动了 
- 继续加油    我们能行的 

1003
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,715
太空海豚说得对
我们的力量还不够

1004
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,842
我们需要更多力量

1005
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,766
再加上主角的力量怎么样?

1006
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,726
我回来了    宝贝 

1007
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,149
喔 

1008
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,735
我再也不生你的气了 太空海豚

1009
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,112
一起上 

1010
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,554
- 耶    太好了  
- 我们还没完事呢

1011
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:53,040
看起来正义联盟在海王的带领下

1012
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,835
摧毁了这个装置并拯救了全世界

1013
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,505
她说得对
你确实带领我们走向了胜利

1014
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,842
我认为这更多的是团队合作

1015
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,312
亚特兰蒂斯的好公民们

1016
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,856
我给你造成了很大的伤害

1017
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,610
我说过法律不允许海王成为国王

1018
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,030
事实上   这一条是我乱写进去的

1019
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,575
在复印中心一个叫萨尔的职员的帮助下印上去的

1020
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,536
- 其实根本没有这样的法律
- 下台去吧!

1021
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,372
即使有   我们也能看出他是最有资格的

1022
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:37,710
因为他把海神的三叉戟从巨大的雕像上拔出来了

1023
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:41,339
所以    海王   我的哥哥 

1024
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:45,218
我把你应得的王冠还给你

1025
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,594
谢谢你 

1026
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,316
好哇 

1027
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:06,906
谢谢你    我保证一定会成为最好的国王   成为最好的英雄

1028
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,534
为了亚特兰蒂斯和全世界

1029
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:16,165
现在     让我们一起跳舞吧 

1030
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,765
喔    你们亚特兰蒂斯人真会开派对 

1031
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,725
谢谢你    钢骨

1032
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,270
我很高兴一切都好起来了

1033
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,690
但是我们要怎么处理红灯、 灵星 和阿托希塔斯呢？

1034
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,277
把它们留给我和太空海豚吧 

1035
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,904
欧亚星正悬赏 他们 

1036
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,948
而我正好想去领赏

1037
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,201
这肯定不是你们最后一次见到我    我一定会---

1038
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,078
噢 

1039
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,246
不 

1040
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,002
谢谢你的帮助    暴狼

1041
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,628
是啊   但少跟我玩多愁善感那一套

1042
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:07,216
下次再见到你们    我可能就没那么好说话了

1043
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,051
再见了   傻瓜们  

1044
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,476
钢骨的自动警报响了  

1045
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,729
看起来像是大猩猩古鲁德在攻击

1046
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:22,023
尼泊尔首都加德满都市

1047
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:25,192
有人说高海拔的雪山

1048
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,112
离海洋和水域都很远吗？

1049
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,616
这听起来就像是海王的工作

1050
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,578
如果你不回家吃晚饭，就打电话来

1051
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,956
一定会的       那么    我们还在等什么?

1052
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,750
有人需要我们的帮助
