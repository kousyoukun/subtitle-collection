1
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:31,667
Okay, Jessica, keep it together.
You got this!

2
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:38,465
Hal needed an off-road vacay,
and you're a Green Lantern.

3
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,135
He asked you to cover his shift
at the Hall of Justice, no biggie.

4
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,428
You are calm, collected, and in control.

5
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:49,351
<i>Calm, collected, and in control, hmm?</i>

6
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:52,813
Shush, you! I don't remember
Hal's Ring talking back to him.

7
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:57,443
<i>That's because Green Lantern Jordan
had accumulated enough Lantern points</i>

8
00:00:57,526 --> 00:00:59,737
<i>to unlock the mute button.</i>

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,363
Ring, enable mute.

10
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:05,492
<i>You, however,
Green Lantern Jessica Cruz, have not!</i>

11
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:08,662
- Looks like trouble.
- Oh, hi, Justice League.

12
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:10,956
Uh, I didn't touch it.
I mean, I was going to touch it,

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,125
but I didn't touch it,
so it isn't my fault, I swear!

14
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,252
And everyone is looking at me,
and I should shut up now!

15
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:18,339
- <i>Minus five Lantern points.</i>
- What for?

16
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:21,592
- <i>Don't make excuses.</i>
- Not to worry, Green Lantern.

17
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:25,262
You didn't do anything wrong.
This is the trouble alert.

18
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:28,015
- It alerts us when...
- When there's trouble?

19
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:30,851
Yes, see? You're a natural at this.

20
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,479
Breaking News with Lois Lane <i>live.</i>

21
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:37,691
It seems trouble is exactly what we've got.

22
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:40,402
And it starts with a capital "L."

23
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:44,907
Well, Lois is many things, Batman,
but I wouldn't call her trouble.

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,867
Not Lois, Superman. Look!

25
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,995
This is Lois Lane
reporting from Area 52 at Dread Lake,

26
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,749
where the intergalactic bounty hunter
known as Lobo is on a rampage.

27
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:04,176
This is like looking for a Denebian needle
in an Alterian haystack creature.

28
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,805
The now-defunct Area 52 facility
was an attempt to streamline

29
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:11,475
the military's overly complex
secret alien technology department.

30
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:13,852
Defunct? I thought
they just built that thing.

31
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:17,189
The simplification program
made things much more complicated.

32
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:20,567
They moved everything
to a warehouse in Rebirth, New Jersey.

33
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:28,742
Where are you, you little
Denebian slime bender? Yeah!

34
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:32,246
Lobo, a Czarnian who is
super strong, super tough,

35
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,958
and has a super potty mouth,
appears to be in search of something.

36
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,752
There's no telling what
dangerous artifact Lobo will discover.

37
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,546
We need to get to Dread Lake fast.

38
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,172
<i>Did someone say "Lake"?</i>

39
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:45,426
<i>Why, that sounds like a job for Aquaman!</i>

40
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,554
Aquaman, you should know that
Dread Lake isn't really your...

41
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,390
<i>Whoa. Sorry. Reception
down here is a little spotty.</i>

42
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:54,101
<i>I'll see you there. Aquaman out!</i>

43
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,315
Evidently, he did not get my memo
about building an undersea cell tower.

44
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:03,777
We really should build
an undersea cell tower down here.

45
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:05,654
The reception is horrible, Orm.

46
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:10,200
I told you, brother,
I prefer to be called "Ocean Master".

47
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:13,203
Oh, sorry, Ocean Master.

48
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,331
Don't worry, I'll call you whatever you want.

49
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:21,545
Oh. There she is. The Aquajet!

50
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:24,214
We just detailed it for you, sire.

51
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:26,800
And a wonderful job you did, too.

52
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:30,596
You guys are great.
I love being the king of you.

53
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:34,475
I almost feel bad about taking it
up to the dusty old surface world.

54
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:38,437
No, no, no. Go! You're needed up there.

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,941
I'll take care of everything
down here while you're gone. Again.

56
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,109
Aw.

57
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,112
Thanks, Ormi!

58
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,199
- It's "Ocean Master".
- Right. Right, right.

59
00:03:50,282 --> 00:03:52,451
Although, kind of a weird nickname,

60
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:55,329
seeing as I am
the King of the Seven Seas and all.

61
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:57,122
But, uh, whatever.

62
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,958
I'm just glad
we can move beyond our petty squabbles,

63
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:03,253
and work to help Atlantis, nay, the world!

64
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:05,255
Together!

65
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:09,468
Yes, I love being a team player.

66
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:14,848
Tell Mera I'll be home for dinner.
It's great to be King.

67
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:21,480
Is it? We'll soon see.

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,487
What? Get back to work!

69
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,496
All right, Aquajet, we're freshwater bound.

70
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,916
It's so gratifying
when my friends in the Justice League

71
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,919
have a water-based problem
and they need my help.

72
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:56,682
Where are you?

73
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,726
You can't hide from the Main Man forever!

74
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,895
Yeah!

75
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,357
- Okay, Jimmy. On me.
- Lois? Is this a good idea?

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,734
Pulitzers were never won
with good ideas, Jimmy.

77
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,111
Now, come on.

78
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:11,071
Uh, isn't that the only reason
they're awarded?

79
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:15,117
Lobo! Lois Lane
reporting for the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,078
Argh! Paparazzi!

81
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,788
No, I'm a serious journalist.

82
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:23,542
If I were paparazzi, I'd have to criticize
your atrocious fashion choices.

83
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,003
- So 1983.
- What?

84
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:31,717
Lady, the Main Man always says,
"Black is the new black!"

85
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:35,596
Well, I say, the Main Man
is about to be feeling the pain, man!

86
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,599
- Says who?
- Says the Justice League!

87
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:40,267
Jimmy, duck!

88
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,562
Pleasure to meet you, Lobo.

89
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:46,982
I am Aquaman, Master of the Seven Seas,

90
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:50,027
defender of dolphins, King of Atlantis.

91
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,863
- Wrecker of jets!
- Wrecker of...

92
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:55,240
Uh, I am unfamiliar with that moniker.

93
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,075
Let me fix that!

94
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,332
So long, you Fluvian seaweed farmer!

95
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,843
No, don't do that! Those are critical.

96
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:18,722
Hey! This is a custom-built vehicle,
and it was just waxed!

97
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:24,353
It seems that Aquaman inexplicably is
the first of the Justice League to arrive.

98
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,563
Despite the fact that we are in the desert.

99
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,108
Uh, farewell, mighty Aquajet,
you've served your King well!

100
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,533
Aquaman! Lois Lane of the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

101
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:41,370
It looks like you really,
as we professional journalists say,

102
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:45,123
"Got your tail fin handed to you"
by the Main Man, Lobo!

103
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,125
No need to worry, Miss Lane.

104
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:51,463
I'll just call for backup,
using my aqua-telepathic powers

105
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:55,759
to summon my fellow water creatures,
here at Dread Lake.

106
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:58,136
But Dread Lake is a dry lake bed!

107
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:03,058
Well, that would be
challenging then, wouldn't it?

108
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:07,562
So much for plan A, B, and C.
No matter, I am still really strong.

109
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:08,647
And... Huh?

110
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,155
Ow! Jeez!

111
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,407
That's gotta hurt!

112
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,035
Good golly, Miss Lane. Aquaman
is really getting filleted out there!

113
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:23,912
Not in the face, not in the face!

114
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,498
Get out of here!

115
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,709
Help!

116
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,797
This is no way to treat royalty!

117
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:36,508
Yeah! A royal pain in the bleezors!

118
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,678
This is why you never send a fish
to do a man's job.

119
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:42,305
- Jimmy, tell me you're getting this.
- Every frame.

120
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,349
But what happens when Lobo gets us?

121
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:47,310
Don't panic, Jimmy.
Here comes the Justice League!

122
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:57,320
It's hero time!

123
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,949
You want me to hero now, really?

124
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:04,286
In front of the whole Justice League?
With everyone watching?

125
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:08,582
Come on, Green Lantern. Or you'll miss
our stylish superhero landing.

126
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:11,209
Oh! Who would wanna miss that?

127
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:22,179
- Jimmy! Slow-mo hero entrance.
- Ooh, right!

128
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,222
Still plenty of time to get the best part!

129
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:30,228
Give yourself up now, Lobo.

130
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,646
You may be strong where you come from,

131
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,608
but the yellow sun of Earth
makes me the strongest...

132
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:39,654
Give up? The Main Man don't give up ever!

133
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,493
I actually felt that!

134
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,873
We might need some help.

135
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:53,043
Ah! I'll be out of here in a trice!

136
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,420
Lobo is as strong as Superman?

137
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:58,757
- Great!
- You got that right, Tin Man!

138
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:02,427
You're gonna have to try harder
to put down the Main Man.

139
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:07,140
Maybe Batman can stop him with something
from his cute little tool belt thingy.

140
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:09,392
Oh, no, she didn't.

141
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:10,811
Ha!

142
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:15,315
What? You know, his little belt of bags.
It's adorable.

143
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:19,945
You mean my Utility Belt!
It's a convenient storage space

144
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,405
for an assortment of tools
without them getting in the way!

145
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:24,950
Would a cute little belt thingy do that?

146
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,076
Uh, kinda.

147
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,702
- Maybe.
- You be you, Batman.

148
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:30,330
- I'm sorry. I just thought...
- Focus!

149
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:33,500
If we want to succeed,
we'll have to work together.

150
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,294
Everyone, on the count of three. One...

151
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:39,214
Um, well, don't wait for me!

152
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,091
- Two...
- Don't screw this up.

153
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,343
Gotta make something big, strong.

154
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:44,469
Three!

155
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,599
A safe? Argh!

156
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:52,144
<i>Oh, how brave. Minus one point.</i>

157
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,152
Ha! Child's play!

158
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,032
Hey! Keep kicking those flippers,
Mr. Jellyfish!

159
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,910
Uh, Jellyfish don't actually have flippers.

160
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,663
Mind if I take you for a spin?

161
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,754
Superman, Cyborg, now!

162
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:34,853
Hey. Ah! So, this is where
you've been hiding?

163
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:37,898
Come to Papa!

164
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:41,026
- The show is over, right?
- It better be.

165
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:43,278
We hit him with everything we've got!

166
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:50,076
If that's all you've got,
you better get more.

167
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,038
Impossible. There's not a scratch on him!

168
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:55,415
Lantern, hit him with everything you've got.

169
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,375
Uh, okay.

170
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,502
I did it!

171
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:03,131
I didn't do it.

172
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:07,010
I'd love to stay and play,
but I've got what I came for.

173
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,392
So long, Justice Losers!

174
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,311
Quick! Before he gets away!

175
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:19,231
Yeah!

176
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:22,442
- Good riddance.
- What do you think he was here for?

177
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:26,571
I don't know.
But whatever it is, it can't be good.

178
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,949
Um. Anyone seen Aquaman?

179
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:33,078
- A little help, please!
- Don't worry. I'll save you!

180
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:39,542
Thanks, team. I'm glad you showed up.
We really saved the day.

181
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,044
Am I right?

182
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,588
- Lois Lane, <i>Daily Planet.</i>
- Yes, I am aware.

183
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,924
How does it feel to have
been humiliated by Lobo,

184
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,551
and saved, once again, by the Justice League?

185
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:53,431
Well, I'm part of a team.
A win for us all is a win for me.

186
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:55,308
So, you don't mind that the world watched

187
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:58,728
the King of Atlantis
run away from Lobo like a scared fish?

188
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,731
No, that's
an unfair characterization of fish.

189
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:05,402
- And, uh, I didn't run.
- Lois, if I may?

190
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:08,238
Aquaman is an essential member
of the Justice League.

191
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,491
- In what way?
- Now, well, he... Uh...

192
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:15,328
- He, uh...
- Don't look at me. I just got here.

193
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:19,165
Aquaman's ability to talk to sea life
is a critical skill.

194
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:22,252
One that I'm sure
he'll use with great effectiveness,

195
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,588
sometime in the future,
when it becomes necessary.

196
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:27,590
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.

197
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:30,510
Aquaman's teammates
are 100% supportive of him,

198
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:33,722
despite his overly specialized powers.

199
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:37,350
For the <i>Daily Planet,</i>
Lois Lane is signing off.

200
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:41,521
Cut! Great stuff. Let's get back home
and run this on tonight's seven o'clock.

201
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,440
I wouldn't worry about it, Aquaman.

202
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:46,109
Not many people watch network news anymore.

203
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:49,988
Oh, I'm not worried.
Besides, we don't get cable in Atlantis.

204
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:53,700
I'm just excited we're finally all together.

205
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:56,494
How about we go somewhere
to feast and celebrate?

206
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:00,832
Or, or... Or we figure out
why Lobo was here in the first place.

207
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,835
Nothing says celebration like apple pie.

208
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,587
I can make you an ambrosia to make
the gods weep!

209
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,088
Let's hit Big Belly Burger!

210
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,217
Allow me to cordially
invite you all to Atlantis!

211
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:16,222
Where we shall celebrate my anniversary
as King of the Seven Seas!

212
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,060
We're going to Atlantis. That is so awesome!

213
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:23,229
Road trip under the sea! I love the sea!

214
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:27,734
Friendly fishies, peaceful porpoises.
No one watching you!

215
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,908
<i>Plus five for appropriate
construct building. Bravo!</i>

216
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,038
Ah, the ocean.

217
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:44,209
Home to the most interesting
forms of life known to man.

218
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,878
Outside of you guys, I mean.

219
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,589
Oh! Fishies!

220
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:53,760
Yes, fish, plants.
We have everything down here.

221
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,261
Even froyo?

222
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:58,681
Well, no, that melts in the seawater,
but we have colorful rocks.

223
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:02,394
And, uh, uh... Coral! We have coral.

224
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,562
Aren't coral and rocks the same thing?

225
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,150
Hardly.

226
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,569
Is it me, or is the water changing color?

227
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:15,323
Good observation, Cyborg.
Red and yellow wavelengths of light

228
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,575
can only travel so far underwater,

229
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,870
which is why everything
looks blue and green at these depths.

230
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:25,542
Oh, that lack of solar energy
is making me feel a little green.

231
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:31,756
I've got the cure for
your super seasickness here in Atlantis!

232
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,140
Beautiful.

233
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:45,145
What's that noise?
Oh, sorry, it sounds like singing.

234
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:48,440
Oh, that must be my song of arrival.

235
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:52,527
My people always like to sing
a little ditty when I'm returning home.

236
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,198
Atlanteans really are the nicest people
on the planet. Shh. Listen.

237
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,083
<i>Our King, the King of the Seven Seas</i>

238
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,918
<i>The mightiest hero is he!</i>

239
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,920
<i>He fights and swims, he swims and fights</i>

240
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:12,797
<i>No greater a hero you'll see!</i>

241
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:16,509
<i>A shark, a whale, a gale
No! The mightiest hero is he</i>

242
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:18,678
<i>He fights and swims, he swims and fights</i>

243
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:23,433
<i>The King of the ocean is he!
The King of the ocean is he!</i>

244
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:28,396
- They really love you, Aquaman.
- What's not to love?

245
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:31,274
Who's that guy? Looks important.

246
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:33,359
King Poseidon.

247
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:36,863
In his hand is the mystical Trident of Hope.

248
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:41,326
Legend states that whosoever pulls
the Trident from the statue's hand,

249
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,621
is the rightful ruler of Atlantis.

250
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:46,998
- Just like Excalibur!
- "Ex" what now?

251
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:48,833
Has anyone been able to do it?

252
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,461
No, it's just an old wives' tale,

253
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:55,673
although the younglings can be seen
trying to pull it out from time to time.

254
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:56,966
Look.

255
00:15:57,091 --> 00:16:00,053
- I almost got it. Mine!
- You got it. You've got it.

256
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,641
And here we are!

257
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,938
Uh, question. How are we gonna
breathe down here?

258
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,649
I've developed a special Bat aqua spray

259
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:15,860
that will temporarily enable us
to oxygenate the water around us.

260
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:20,031
Oh, you keep a mist spray
in those cute little pouches?

261
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:28,456
Welcome! Please make yourselves at home.

262
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:31,918
As my dolphin friends
from the Gulf of Mexico say...

263
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:38,466
Roughly translated, <i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

264
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,094
Arthur, you've finally returned.

265
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:43,930
Mera, so great to see you!

266
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:47,308
- Who's that tall glass of water?
- Tall?

267
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:49,519
Aren't we all the same size, Cyborg?

268
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,855
This is my wife, Mera.

269
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:55,441
Wait, you're married?

270
00:16:56,276 --> 00:17:00,822
I mean, of course, you're married.
Aquaman talks about you all the time.

271
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:04,617
Well, I'm sorry I haven't had a chance
to meet you all in person.

272
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:08,204
I've been busy perfecting my craft
while Arthur has been away.

273
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,956
- Your craft?
- Yes.

274
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,584
Not only is Mera the Queen of Atlantis,

275
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:16,713
she's also a master conjuror of hard water.

276
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:19,632
- Oh! Make the fish!
- Hard water?

277
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:22,677
- Is that like hard candy?
- Oh, no, no. It's better.

278
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,263
Watch this. Mera, make the fish!

279
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:32,270
Isn't that amazing?

280
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:35,690
Oh, my God! How did you do that?

281
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:39,819
Magic. With my aquakinesis,
I can make anything.

282
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,990
- Here's a car.
- Make the fish again!

283
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:47,577
- And a chair.
- The fish!

284
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,788
And here's your fish again, Arthur.

285
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:54,417
Fish! That kills me every time.

286
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,172
I am so glad you are here.

287
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:02,508
And just in time
for the royal feast in honor of Arthur.

288
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:05,720
Please, won't you join me
at the banquet in the throne room?

289
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:07,096
Yes!

290
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:11,017
Grub time! Time to put
my cast iron stomach to the test.

291
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,728
Throne room? You sit on a throne?

292
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,730
Ha! It's just a small one.

293
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:35,875
Oh, man,
I bet they have the best seafood here!

294
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,710
Right you are, Cyborg.

295
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:41,130
Atlantis is the culinary epicenter
of the ocean.

296
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:42,924
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

297
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:46,094
Tonight, we'll be having
your choice of seaweed burgers,

298
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:49,138
seaweed spaghetti or seaweed salad.

299
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,849
Seaweed? What about lobster, or crab?

300
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,184
Or maybe even some shrimp?

301
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,478
Heavens no!

302
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,524
Under the sea, all sea life
have full citizenship rights.

303
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,068
But don't worry, try the seaweed slaw.

304
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:04,821
It is num-num nummy in your tum-tum tummy.

305
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,327
Oh, man! I was really
looking forward to some lobster!

306
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,996
My bad.

307
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,043
Does anyone else hear that?

308
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:22,797
Or do I have another bad
case of super swimmers' ear?

309
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,426
Bat burp. Pardon. It's coming from outside.

310
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:31,264
Gather round, gather round! Closer, closer!

311
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,558
- This is really too much!
- How long is this going to go on?

312
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,810
Maybe he'll blow our minds
this time with something.

313
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:39,188
Last time, he talked for three hours.
I've got ships to wax!

314
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:42,817
I've come to discuss
a matter of grave importance.

315
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,945
The fate of Atlantis!

316
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:49,240
- Ocean Master.
- Who is Ocean Master?

317
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:52,827
Only the saltiest scoundrel
of the Seven Seas.

318
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,620
He's also my half-brother.

319
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:58,332
Once you get to know him,
he's really not that bad. Come on!

320
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,170
Ocean Master is related to Aquaman?

321
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:05,506
I don't recall him sharing that
on his application form.

322
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,717
Now I'll have to update his records.

323
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:12,096
You say that our King is mighty,
but on the surface world,

324
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,807
he's referred to as a joke!

325
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,518
The only joke I see around here
is up on stage!

326
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,024
Really? Let me ask you.

327
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,985
If the king can't defeat
a surface dweller up there,

328
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,655
how is he going to defend you down here, hmm?

329
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:32,575
I don't know. He's always
treated us pretty well.

330
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:33,951
Has he?

331
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:39,457
Please let me shed some light
on our beloved King.

332
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:43,169
<i>Warning!</i>

333
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:44,504
Argh!

334
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,590
Green Lantern, what are you doing?

335
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,425
The Ring just did this on its own.

336
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,677
<i>Detecting increasing levels of rage.</i>

337
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,224
What was that? What's going on?

338
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:59,685
As I was saying about our absent King...

339
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,938
Absent King...

340
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:06,567
How can you follow a king
that everyone laughs at? Behold!

341
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,580
Coward! Ran away!

342
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:22,250
Coward?

343
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,504
I was stalling until
the Justice League showed up!

344
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:30,466
And lastly, how can you trust a king

345
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,261
that is actually only
half-Atlantean to begin with?

346
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:40,351
Well yeah, my father was an average
run-of-the-mill surface dweller.

347
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:44,564
I have to update the files again!

348
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:47,483
- He can't be King!
- Argh! This changes everything.

349
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:52,363
Ocean Master, brother,
what is the meaning of this?

350
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:54,782
Is this payback for the time
I locked you in that bathroom?

351
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:56,868
Let's go inside and talk.

352
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:00,037
Enough talking! It's time for action!

353
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:03,332
Too long have you broken
the laws of Atlantis!

354
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,294
Laws? Arthur, what is he talking about?

355
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:11,048
I'll show you.
You aren't actually supposed to be King.

356
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:15,219
Behold! The Constitution of Atlantis.

357
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:18,222
- What does that prove?
- There, near the bottom, in fine print.

358
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:20,975
Here, let me use my super vision.

359
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:25,062
Wow! That... That is small.

360
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:27,273
I might need a magnifying glass.

361
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:31,402
Yet another advantage of my Utility Belt.

362
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,155
Let's see. It says,

363
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:39,619
"To rule Atlantis,
you must be full-blooded Atlantean."

364
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,370
Oh, no!

365
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:44,707
I can't breathe!

366
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,125
But you can breathe anywhere.

367
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:49,712
Oh. Good point.

368
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:54,175
So, you see, my brother,
you aren't the rightful ruler.

369
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:55,885
I am!

370
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:59,096
Ocean Master! Ocean Master!

371
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:03,434
Ocean Master! Ocean Master!

372
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,811
Arthur, what are you going to do?

373
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:08,397
There is only one thing I can do.

374
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:12,526
In accordance with the Atlantean law
I have sworn to uphold,

375
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,198
I hereby relinquish my crown to my brother.

376
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,492
Half-brother.

377
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:23,245
Rule well, my King.

378
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:25,957
No takesie-backsies.

379
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:31,629
Ocean Master! Ocean Master! Ocean Master!

380
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:35,299
Arthur! I can't believe you
just gave your throne away.

381
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,511
Mera, I have made my decision.

382
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:43,140
Without even talking to me about it?
We're supposed to be a team, Arthur.

383
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:45,017
- Mera, I...
- No.

384
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:49,230
This is what you want, fine.
You can do it without me!

385
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:55,778
Wow! What a really great trick!
She is really good.

386
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:59,281
Too soon? My bad.

387
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:01,701
Now that I am King of Atlantis,

388
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:06,914
let me introduce you to the person
who encouraged me to take what was mine.

389
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,916
<i>Threat alert! Omega detected!</i>

390
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,209
Oh, no!

391
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,585
My royal adviser,

392
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:15,464
and all-around good guy, Atrocitus!

393
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:22,763
Atrocitus!

394
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,016
<i>Execute defense maneuver. Omega five.</i>

395
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,316
This is your defense?
A couch ain't gonna do nothing!

396
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,568
Argh!

397
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:36,777
Who is Atrocitus?

398
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:40,114
<i>Atrocitus, leader of the Red Lantern Corps.</i>

399
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:43,826
<i>They have the ability to enslave minds
with the power of rage.</i>

400
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:46,328
<i>I suggest leaving, quickly.</i>

401
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:48,289
Hal spoke of the Red Lanterns.

402
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:51,917
It's their lantern light that's
infecting the Atlanteans with rage.

403
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:56,047
Looks like Green Lantern's shield
is protecting us from the red light.

404
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:03,012
Hello, water-dwellers.

405
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:06,724
As your new royal adviser,

406
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,310
my first piece of advice is,

407
00:25:09,393 --> 00:25:12,271
destroy the Justice League!

408
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,857
- Destroy them!
- Get them! Get them!

409
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,025
I got the one with the cape!

410
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,112
Get out of that!

411
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,616
I'm not sure how much
more my bubble can take.

412
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:24,825
<i>Very little.</i>

413
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:27,411
It somehow doesn't feel right
to just start punching them.

414
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:31,749
We cannot. I may not be their king,
but they are still my people.

415
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:34,168
We must retreat and form a plan.

416
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:37,088
I know a way out, but we need a distraction.

417
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:42,843
Well, lucky for you, my super useful
Utility Belt has just the thing.

418
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,348
An ink bomb! Ingenious.

419
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:50,226
Did you see where they went?
Where did they go?

420
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:55,815
Find them! They couldn't have gotten far!

421
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:58,526
You've done well, Ocean Master.

422
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:01,654
You mean "King Ocean Master."

423
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,615
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.

424
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:07,159
My plan to infect the Atlanteans

425
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:10,746
with my Red Lantern rage
seems to have worked.

426
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:16,210
At last, all of Atlantis bows to me!

427
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:19,421
And now begins Stage Two.

428
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:27,012
These secret tunnels
are only known to the royal family.

429
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:31,058
If we act quickly, we might
be able to get out before they stop us.

430
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:33,561
How? I'm sure they have
the palace surrounded.

431
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:36,355
- The Sea Gate, of course.
- The "Sea" what now?

432
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:38,607
Behold!

433
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:45,239
What is that?

434
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:47,658
That is the Sea Gate.

435
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,161
It can open an interdimensional portal

436
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:54,373
between Atlantis and other aquatic
planets throughout the universe!

437
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:59,420
Oh, I wasn't aware that
Atlantean technology was so advanced.

438
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:01,755
Updating files.

439
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,465
I think they're down here!

440
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,177
Aquaman, there must be something you can do.

441
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,554
Well, I don't know
how to change the location,

442
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,432
but I can access the last place it opened to.

443
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:18,856
- Let's move, team.
- You go! I'll stay to close the Gate.

444
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:22,318
I can't leave my people
in this dire predicament, and Mera!

445
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:24,945
If you don't come now,
you won't have a people to save.

446
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:31,785
Jessica, hurry! They're coming.

447
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:35,414
But where does it lead? What if
there are more people on the other side,

448
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:37,708
with expectations and judgments?

449
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:41,170
<i>The odds on that are about
1.7 billion to one.</i>

450
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:42,838
So, you're saying there's a chance?

451
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:45,966
Lantern, there's no time for what ifs! Hurry!

452
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,426
There they are!

453
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:49,428
Wait, don't!

454
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:52,806
I said "don't," not "donut"!

455
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:02,233
<i>Minus five Lantern points for poor diction!</i>

456
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,653
They've escaped! Inform Atrocitus!

457
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:08,239
- Down here!
- Down here!

458
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,658
<i>Threat approaching!</i>

459
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,534
I think I heard something.

460
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:14,286
Thanks a lot, big mouth!

461
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,748
<i>Quick, run away from your problems.
It seems to help.</i>

462
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:20,960
A dead end! Oh, no! What am I going to do?

463
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:24,964
<i>Yes, if only you had the universe's
most powerful weapon in your...</i>

464
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,840
<i>Oh, wait...</i>

465
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:29,385
Come on, Ring, how about a little help here?

466
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:31,595
<i>You must overcome your fear.</i>

467
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,305
- I can't!
- <i>You can!</i>

468
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:37,726
<i>My record for selecting recruits
has been perfect. Until now, anyway.</i>

469
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,229
Well, better luck with the next candidate!

470
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:44,733
Whoa!

471
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:51,865
Nailed it!

472
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,952
On the run from my own kingdom.

473
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:58,539
- Outrageous.
- Where are we?

474
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:03,335
It looks like some sort of factory.
But what are they making?

475
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,671
And more importantly, where is Green Lantern?

476
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:09,717
Unfortunately, this crisis
proved too much for her inexperience.

477
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,721
She's a bit too green.
We'll have to go back and get her.

478
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:16,265
Aquaman, can you turn the Sea Gate back on?

479
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:18,183
Turn it back on?

480
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,353
Someone's coming. Everyone, hide.

481
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,856
Well, that's strange.
I should have heard them approaching.

482
00:29:35,868 --> 00:29:38,620
- Invasion?
- What's that, Aquaman?

483
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:42,541
Well, Wonder Woman,
I communicate with aquatic life fluidly,

484
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:44,126
but I also speak a little cat.

485
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:48,464
They're readying for an invasion,
or something about kitty litter.

486
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:51,425
- It could go either way.
- Of course.

487
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:54,219
That's Dex-Starr, the Red Lantern cat.

488
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:56,096
It's all so clear now.

489
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,308
Atrocitus and Ocean Master
are using the Sea Gate in Atlantis

490
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:03,103
to bring an armada
of rage-fueled battle machines to Earth.

491
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,608
Impossible! The Sea Gate isn't designed
to be able to transport an army!

492
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,653
That will take more power than
is available to... Well, anyone.

493
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,072
Speaking of power,

494
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:17,242
I'm detecting a huge energy surge
coming from somewhere in this room.

495
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:20,621
- Like that one!
- The orb from Area 52.

496
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:22,831
That's what's powering the Gate!

497
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:27,586
Now, Atrocitus can use Atlantis as
a beachhead to attack the surface world.

498
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:30,422
Ingenious! They've taken my crown,

499
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:33,092
my kingdom,
and now, the peace I've maintained

500
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:35,469
between the two realms I call home.

501
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:37,221
I must get back there!

502
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:40,599
We're not getting anywhere with all these
robots between us and the Sea Gate.

503
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:43,811
This looks like a job for Superman!

504
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:50,567
I don't understand. My powers, they're gone!

505
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:54,279
Worry about that later, Superman.
Here they come.

506
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:16,135
Yet another handy tool from
my all-purpose Utility Belt.

507
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,721
Oh.

508
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:22,307
They must have some automated repair system.

509
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:26,186
Cyborg, can you disrupt them?

510
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,189
Hold on to your ears. It's sonic cannon time!

511
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,280
Oh, man!

512
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:41,577
By the hairballs of Hades,
that is one furious feline!

513
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:47,749
Okay, Clark, you've got this!

514
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:54,506
Wonder Woman, are you all right?

515
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,218
But, Mother,
all the other kids' jets are visible!

516
00:31:58,302 --> 00:32:01,180
Apparently, Wonder Woman
has been knocked silly.

517
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:03,724
- Are you sure?
- Bi-ba-ba-ba-ba!

518
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,142
Yeah, I'm sure.

519
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,773
Oh. Hello there.

520
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,859
You're a space dolphin, aren't you?

521
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:16,570
Yes, I know of your species.

522
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:20,782
Let me use my telepathic abilities
to ask you for help.

523
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:28,582
What? I would
never say something about your mother!

524
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:31,335
My telepathy must not be working
on dolphins from space.

525
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:36,381
That is one angry space dolphin.

526
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:37,883
We're completely outmatched.

527
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:40,552
- We have to get out of here.
- Leave that to me.

528
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:43,055
This should buy us some time.

529
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:53,732
- Amazing!
- In here!

530
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:00,864
Ha! Looks like you can't get in here!

531
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:04,701
- Nyeh, nyeh...
- Haha. Right. Why is he smiling?

532
00:33:07,871 --> 00:33:09,957
Whoa! Is anyone else hot in here?

533
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,501
I thought it was just me. I'm burning up!

534
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:14,002
Burned up...

535
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:17,923
That's why this room is decorated
exactly like the inside of a furnace...

536
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:20,008
Because it is a furnace!

537
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,637
A furnace! What are we gonna do?
We need to get out of here fast!

538
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,098
Without my powers,
I can't fly us out of here.

539
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,475
And my rocket boots are still waterlogged.

540
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,728
My head is beginning to clear.
All I have to do is...

541
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:37,734
It appears my grapple
can't reach the top of the smokestack.

542
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:41,613
I love cheese, but it doesn't love me.

543
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:46,451
Yeah. Anyways, we just
have to be like jellyfish.

544
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:51,873
Batman, you don't happen to have a Bat
parachute in your Utility Belt, do you?

545
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,837
There, it's simple.

546
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,673
Heat rises and with it, so should we.

547
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:03,427
- It's working.
- But not enough. Look!

548
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,140
I don't know if we're gonna make it!

549
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:23,864
We made it! Hey!

550
00:34:23,947 --> 00:34:26,950
Didn't you say the Sea Gate
went to other water-covered worlds?

551
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:28,910
It's supposed to.

552
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:31,455
It feels almost as hot out here as in there.

553
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:34,207
Where have I led us now? Death Valley?

554
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,376
Nowhere near that close.

555
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:39,671
Look! A red sun!

556
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:43,008
No wonder my powers don't work.
We're on a different planet.

557
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:47,971
We aren't gonna last long out here
without finding civilization.

558
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:51,099
How did you fit that
and the parachute in your belt?

559
00:34:51,183 --> 00:34:53,101
Bat secret. Now, come on!

560
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:56,897
I am so getting
a Utility Belt when I get home.

561
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:06,323
Mera, thank goodness! How did you find me?

562
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:08,909
I heard your voice coming through
the other side of the tunnel.

563
00:35:08,992 --> 00:35:11,036
And look what I found!

564
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,207
Someone has secretly assembled
an entire armada in my kingdom.

565
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:19,252
There's enough stuff here for Atrocitus
to take over the surface world.

566
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:22,172
- We have to tell everyone.
- Why should we?

567
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:25,133
The surface world
has caused us nothing but trouble.

568
00:35:25,217 --> 00:35:27,636
- They deserve destruction.
- But Aquaman said...

569
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,765
My husband? He's not even
brave enough to fight for his own crown!

570
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:34,518
<i>Perhaps try talking some sense into her?</i>

571
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,561
Mera, you have to fight it!

572
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:38,438
I'd rather fight you!

573
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:44,695
<i>A tactical retreat would be strongly advised.</i>

574
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:47,280
Maybe you surface-dwellers
should be destroyed.

575
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,408
Starting with you!

576
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:54,579
Don't! I mean, stay back!

577
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:59,376
You think the Queen of Atlantis is going
to be afraid of the chicken of the sea?

578
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,630
Ha! You missed!

579
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,340
I wasn't aiming for you.

580
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:09,386
Argh! Argh!

581
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:11,972
<i>Plus 10 for ingenuity.</i>

582
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:15,892
Let's hope those flying lessons
from Hal paid off!

583
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:27,738
Hey, guys, is it just me,
or is this sand really soft?

584
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:32,492
It's like we're walking on water. Yes, water!

585
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:36,455
Water! Look, water!

586
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:42,961
Come on in, guys! The water is perfect!

587
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:46,006
It's happening faster than I thought.

588
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:49,301
The lack of water
is causing him to hallucinate.

589
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:52,637
I don't feel so good.

590
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:55,682
Step back.

591
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:59,144
Let me use some of my Bat
smelling salts to try and revive him.

592
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:02,189
Your Utility Belt is almost
as great as you are.

593
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:03,857
Almost. Now, stand back.

594
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:10,071
He's stiff as a board.

595
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:12,866
Even if I had my super strength,
I don't think I could move him.

596
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:14,201
Let me try.

597
00:37:17,954 --> 00:37:19,331
Interesting.

598
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:23,126
- Interesting how?
- Wonder Woman, can you lift him?

599
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,341
Strange, it's as if his body
is pulling towards something.

600
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,344
If I had to guess,
I think his Atlantean physiology

601
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:34,638
draws him naturally to water.

602
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:37,432
He is a human divining rod.

603
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,142
So, what should we do?

604
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:41,353
Follow his lead.

605
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:58,161
Ah, Mera.

606
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:03,458
Rah! Rah! Back off, tadpoles!
I'm the Queen of Atlantis!

607
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,126
The former Queen.

608
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,214
Oh. About that collateral
dethroning, sorry. Not sorry.

609
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:11,591
But now, that you've seen
the light of my leadership,

610
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:14,636
how do you wish to serve me, hmm?

611
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,140
Those surface dwellers,
they really rub my scales the wrong way.

612
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,645
- I'm glad to hear it.
- If I may, My Liege?

613
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,732
We have a perfect position in Stage Two.

614
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:31,278
As per our mutually beneficial arrangement.

615
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:38,159
Go! Take the surface world
for your new master!

616
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:43,248
The surface world
and Aquaman will feel my rage!

617
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:58,597
- I love Star City Pier.
- More than you love me?

618
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,224
Mmm.

619
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:04,853
- Isn't this fun, Damian?
- Eh.

620
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:07,522
Oh, come on! It can't be that bad!

621
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,984
Barbara, all we're doing is
going around in a circle.

622
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,903
I'm not sure what's so exhilarating about it.

623
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:16,740
This is why we took the day off
from being Batgirl and Robin.

624
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:19,409
You need to learn what it's like
to be a normal kid.

625
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:23,288
I'm a normal kid. I do kid things.

626
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:27,584
Like what? You don't play video games,
stay up late past your bedtime.

627
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,377
You don't even talk like a kid.

628
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:33,006
- Do, too!
- Do not! What are you doing?

629
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,134
Accessing Bat database.
Searching "kid behavior."

630
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,720
Speed reading, and done!

631
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:41,014
You want me to act like a kid, you got it!

632
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:43,767
Totes legit and killin' it.

633
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,977
- Huh?
- Take a chill pill, B.

634
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:49,230
This is gonna be G to the double-O D.

635
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:50,690
Oh, what have I done?

636
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:51,983
Selfie!

637
00:39:56,571 --> 00:40:00,075
Shiver me timbers! I've caught one already!

638
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:04,621
Now, what kind of fish is that?

639
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:06,748
Wonder what it tastes like fried.

640
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,921
It tastes like rage!

641
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:32,232
Looks like our day off just got called off.

642
00:40:32,315 --> 00:40:34,776
Robin? Are you listening to me?

643
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,363
- Kids don't listen.
- Argh! Come on!

644
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:54,462
Hang in there, gang.

645
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:57,340
We'll take a break
once we get to the top of this ridge.

646
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:01,803
Oh, no! I'm starting to hallucinate.

647
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:06,307
You're not hallucinating, Superman.
I see it, too.

648
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:15,025
That's a funny name for a place.

649
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:17,110
You think we should go in and take a look?

650
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:20,030
Whoa!

651
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:21,197
Wonder Woman!

652
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,510
Ooh!

653
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:08,244
- What can I get you?
- Five waters, please.

654
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:11,998
Five waters? You guys
sure ain't from around here.

655
00:42:12,082 --> 00:42:14,459
Let me see what I can pull up for you.

656
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:20,799
- Ah!
- Oh, yeah!

657
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:27,931
Sweet singing seahorses! That is
the best water I have ever tasted!

658
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:30,100
- I'll have another.
- Big spender.

659
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:33,561
- That's expensive stuff!
- Water is expensive?

660
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:36,815
Ever since the red guy
sucked all the water up. Oh!

661
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:38,650
Atrocitus was here?

662
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:41,194
If he took all the water
from this planet, then...

663
00:42:41,277 --> 00:42:45,406
He might do the same to Earth!
We have to get back home and stop him!

664
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:50,120
Say, how you people
paying for this here water?

665
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:51,204
Uh...

666
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,543
Put it on my Batster card.

667
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:58,837
No credit. Klagthorps only!

668
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,755
What's a Klagthorp?

669
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,175
Sir, there has to be something we can
do around here to pay off our tab.

670
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:07,428
The only thing you can do is pay up, or else!

671
00:43:07,512 --> 00:43:11,057
Or else what? I've lost everything.

672
00:43:11,307 --> 00:43:13,434
My wife is mad at me,

673
00:43:13,518 --> 00:43:16,062
the world thinks I'm a laughingstock!

674
00:43:18,481 --> 00:43:23,027
You and I could be pals! To pals!

675
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,030
Huh?

676
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:31,035
- Is Aquaman okay?
- Aquaman is clearly dehydrated.

677
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,831
The lack of water in his system
is obviously affecting his temperament.

678
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:38,668
You are affecting my temperament, Batman!

679
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:40,295
All of you are!

680
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,090
Deadbeats, huh?

681
00:43:44,174 --> 00:43:49,012
Well, I guess that means I have
to introduce you to my debt collectors!

682
00:43:53,558 --> 00:43:54,893
Aquaman, look...

683
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:56,853
No, the only cure for a pity party

684
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:59,564
is to invite a little company over.

685
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:02,025
Oh, right. Wait. Huh?

686
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:07,363
You know, there was a time when
I could have paid for all this water.

687
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:12,744
Heck! I could have bought
this entire place, but no!

688
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:17,207
I had to go and give up my crown!

689
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:23,504
I just bowed and let Ocean Master
take the crown right off my head!

690
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:27,550
I mean, being a king
is a lot of pressure, you know?

691
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:32,680
And believe me, at eight tons per
square inch at the bottom of the sea,

692
00:44:32,764 --> 00:44:35,183
I know pressure. I used to be King.

693
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:46,361
What's going on?

694
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:47,612
It appears the locals

695
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:49,364
are paying our tab.

696
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:51,241
All right!

697
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:55,745
Gee, Aquaman, that was great!
I mean, is there anything you can't do?

698
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:56,996
Yodel.

699
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:00,667
Something to do with how my gills
interact with my uvula.

700
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,673
Give it up for the Main Man!

701
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:08,508
Uh-oh.

702
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:15,139
How do I stop this thing?

703
00:45:15,223 --> 00:45:18,726
- <i>Step one. Stop screaming!</i>
- Oh, great!

704
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,774
Ow! Ow! Ow!

705
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:27,860
Any landing you walk away from... Right?

706
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:31,114
<i>Correct. Plus two Lantern points
for survival.</i>

707
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:32,865
Only two? Sheesh!

708
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:35,451
Green Lantern?

709
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:42,875
Batgirl? Robin? What are you doing here?

710
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,048
Five points for the kid.
Zero for the old bat!

711
00:45:50,174 --> 00:45:52,593
We were hoping for a day off.

712
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:55,596
But now,
Aquaman's Atlantean army is attacking?

713
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,265
What? No, no!

714
00:45:57,348 --> 00:46:01,019
The Atlanteans are being controlled
by Atrocitus and his rage light.

715
00:46:01,102 --> 00:46:03,563
We gotta get out of here
and find some other heroes.

716
00:46:03,646 --> 00:46:05,815
There's no time. Look!

717
00:46:13,698 --> 00:46:17,243
Destroy the surface dwellers! Attack! Attack!

718
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:18,703
Uh-oh.

719
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:25,335
Well, look what we have here.
Last time I saw you,

720
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:29,297
I made your friend here
look like a real billinbore.

721
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,215
Easiest money I ever made.

722
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:34,344
Money? Someone hired you to do that?

723
00:46:34,427 --> 00:46:37,138
Yeah. Some guy named Puddle Prince,

724
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:38,431
or Lake Leader...

725
00:46:38,514 --> 00:46:39,891
Ocean Master!

726
00:46:39,974 --> 00:46:43,394
Yeah, that's the guy.
He asked me to grab some power orb

727
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:46,230
and humiliate Salty Britches here
in the process.

728
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:48,983
The orb that powered
the Red Lantern's Sea Gate.

729
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:52,987
Well, it doesn't matter if you were
hired or not. Theft is theft.

730
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,865
I'm afraid we're gonna have to take you in.

731
00:46:55,948 --> 00:47:00,453
Whoa. Don't get your blankie in a twist.
I'm not here for a scuffle.

732
00:47:00,536 --> 00:47:02,413
I'm looking for my friend, Fishy.

733
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:05,458
You wouldn't by chance have
seen my friend, would you?

734
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:08,211
I recognize him.

735
00:47:08,836 --> 00:47:11,255
And I know where he is.

736
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:14,175
Then you're gonna tell me right now.

737
00:47:14,258 --> 00:47:16,219
On one condition.

738
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:18,638
Are you crazy right now? Tell him!

739
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:21,099
The only condition is,

740
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:24,560
if you don't tell me,
I'm gonna pound you into minced fish.

741
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:27,855
Go ahead. I've got nothing else to lose.

742
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:32,068
But you'll never find out
where your pal Fishy is.

743
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:34,570
Mmm.

744
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:40,660
Mr. Jellyfish has a spine after all.

745
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:42,245
What do you want?

746
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,540
We want you to take us
to the Red Lantern factory

747
00:47:45,623 --> 00:47:49,001
and figure out how to use
the Sea Gate to get us home.

748
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:53,339
That's the deal. Take it, or leave it.

749
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:54,632
Fine.

750
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:57,552
Deal.

751
00:47:59,345 --> 00:48:00,471
Ew!

752
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:04,142
It looks like the King of Atlantis
has returned.

753
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,812
Bartender, I'll take one more water
for the road.

754
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:11,190
Sorry, pal. You guys drank the last of it.

755
00:48:11,482 --> 00:48:13,818
Last of it? Don't be ridiculous.

756
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:17,029
I'm a human divining rod,
and I know where water is.

757
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:20,867
Why, there's a whole reservoir
right below your bar!

758
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:35,089
All right. Let's go.

759
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:37,800
I only have room on my bike
for one more person.

760
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:39,635
How are the rest of you gonna get there?

761
00:48:42,972 --> 00:48:45,391
I have an idea.

762
00:48:50,354 --> 00:48:51,856
This is awesome!

763
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:55,693
- It feels like I can fly again!
- Smoother than my invisible jet.

764
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:58,237
It is mildly amusing.

765
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:00,072
Bat flip!

766
00:49:07,288 --> 00:49:09,790
<i>The invasion is going swimmingly.</i>

767
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,710
<i>Mouth-breathers have finally run out of air,</i>

768
00:49:12,793 --> 00:49:16,923
<i>as Atlantean ships give
them a taste of their own pollution!</i>

769
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:21,427
<i>Nothing can stop us,
as we rage against the 29% of the Earth</i>

770
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:25,306
<i>that hordes 100% of our resources!</i>

771
00:49:25,515 --> 00:49:27,517
<i>Poseidonspeed, friends!</i>

772
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,938
<i>Bring us back a whopper
to hang above the throne!</i>

773
00:49:34,148 --> 00:49:36,442
I love this show!

774
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:39,695
Now, to begin Stage Three.

775
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:42,323
Wait, we only talked about two stages.

776
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,453
- Is Stage Three...
- Oh. Didn't I tell you?

777
00:49:47,662 --> 00:49:52,250
I'm using the Atlanteans
to help me assemble a new weapon,

778
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:56,170
one that will quell
any resistance on the surface world.

779
00:49:56,379 --> 00:50:00,007
Ooh! That sounds really neat.
What does it do?

780
00:50:00,132 --> 00:50:01,676
You'll see soon enough.

781
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:06,514
Besides, the king needn't bother
with the affairs on the surface.

782
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:10,184
Ah. That is the deal we made.

783
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:14,855
I rule everything underwater,
while you handle everything on dry land.

784
00:50:15,314 --> 00:50:20,152
- All right. Carry on.
- As you wish.

785
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:41,173
Just as we promised, Mr. Lobo.
There's your friend.

786
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:44,468
Fishy!

787
00:50:46,846 --> 00:50:48,598
So much for the element of surprise.

788
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:52,059
- Attack for justice!
- Wait for me!

789
00:50:52,226 --> 00:50:54,395
Is there a ladder, or... Ooh! Good.

790
00:50:59,734 --> 00:51:01,944
Get back here, you tin boxes!

791
00:51:06,407 --> 00:51:09,952
Factory robot? Try unsatisfactory robot!

792
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,582
You make me wish I was a dog person.

793
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:36,062
Fishy! I was so worried about you!

794
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:38,773
You disappeared,
and I didn't know where you went.

795
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:51,410
The orb must be powering the entire facility.

796
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:53,120
Hurry! The Gate is closing.

797
00:51:58,334 --> 00:52:01,379
All right, I'm here! For justice...

798
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:03,673
Uh, and the Gate is closed.

799
00:52:08,552 --> 00:52:12,765
I can't believe Fishy did that.
He poked me in the eye.

800
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:16,227
- And hit you with his tail.
- And hit me with his tail!

801
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,062
Not helping, Cyborg.

802
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,149
Listen. Listen...

803
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:27,071
Friendship, like anything worth having,
is worth fighting for.

804
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:30,241
Come with us. Help us free Fishy

805
00:52:30,324 --> 00:52:33,828
and the rest of those
under the Red Lantern's control.

806
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:36,372
No! No!

807
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:40,710
The Main Man ain't gonna crawl back
and beg to be anyone's friend.

808
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:44,088
- But...
- No! This is your fight.

809
00:52:47,216 --> 00:52:51,429
I'm done! I don't need any friends!
I don't need anything!

810
00:52:54,807 --> 00:52:56,976
I did not see that coming.

811
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:59,603
We have to get home to fight Atrocitus' army.

812
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:01,105
But how?

813
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:06,652
Hmm. I've got an idea!

814
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,626
Hey, my hot dogs! Oh!

815
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:25,588
Whoa!

816
00:53:26,964 --> 00:53:30,259
Us against the establishment!
Fight the power!

817
00:53:30,342 --> 00:53:32,219
I love the enthusiasm!

818
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:36,265
Fly swatter!

819
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:42,188
I know. I know. It's not a fly swatter.
Quit judging me!

820
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,981
<i>This is Lois Lane, reporting live.</i>

821
00:53:44,064 --> 00:53:45,566
<i>With the rest of
the Justice League still missing,</i>

822
00:53:45,649 --> 00:53:47,485
<i>the only defense against this invasion</i>

823
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:50,112
<i>are Robin, Batgirl,
and the new Green Lantern!</i>

824
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:53,282
The whole world is now watching
to see if they can pull it off!

825
00:53:55,075 --> 00:53:59,955
The whole world, watching... This is crazy.

826
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:05,711
- Green Lantern, are you okay?
- This is a mistake.

827
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:08,380
We need to leave. We have to go!

828
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:10,424
Green Lantern, come back!

829
00:54:17,264 --> 00:54:22,686
Now, surface dwellers,
feel the rage of Atlantis!

830
00:54:39,912 --> 00:54:42,206
Well, I got the Gate working again.

831
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:46,335
- How'd you guys do?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

832
00:54:48,254 --> 00:54:53,384
Mount up! It is time to show them
what the Justice League can do!

833
00:54:55,678 --> 00:54:56,679
Yeah!

834
00:54:59,598 --> 00:55:02,309
So many eyes judging me,
everyone in the world watching me!

835
00:55:02,393 --> 00:55:05,062
I can't handle this. I need help.

836
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:07,231
Oh, look, I can't do this alone!

837
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:10,025
Ring, show me all superheroes closest to me!

838
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:16,699
<i>Whatever she's doing to them,
they can't last much longer.</i>

839
00:55:28,836 --> 00:55:30,629
Oh, this is the best!

840
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:35,009
No wonder Aquaman wanted to be King.
You get to do whatever you want!

841
00:55:35,134 --> 00:55:39,179
You and I, Atrocitus,
are the unmatched rulers of this world!

842
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,808
I wouldn't be so sure of that, brother!

843
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:10,586
Impressive. But your pathetic machines

844
00:56:10,669 --> 00:56:13,964
are no match for my Red Lantern rage!

845
00:56:20,596 --> 00:56:23,349
You're all bark, and no bite!

846
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:26,435
Time for a cat nap!

847
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:33,275
Stop it!

848
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:34,902
You're supposed to be peaceful creatures.

849
00:56:34,985 --> 00:56:36,654
There's nothing peaceful about you.

850
00:56:39,198 --> 00:56:42,451
Your machines can't shield you
from my Lantern light forever.

851
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:50,376
Lighten up, Atrocitus.

852
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:55,798
Enough! You can't stop Atrocitus!

853
00:56:55,923 --> 00:57:00,511
My central battery is full
from the rage of this planet,

854
00:57:00,636 --> 00:57:05,933
and has rendered me all-powerful!

855
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:08,936
We have to destroy that battery.
Come on, team!

856
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:34,336
Brother, stop this madness now!

857
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,463
Never! I'm King!

858
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:41,927
My friends!

859
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,781
Ha-ha!

860
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:05,159
Where is your hope now?

861
00:58:05,242 --> 00:58:07,745
Yeah, where's your hope?

862
00:58:07,995 --> 00:58:12,458
I assume now, you'll try and take us
over with your Red Lantern rage.

863
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:15,419
All in good time, but right now,

864
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:19,965
you have a front row seat
to the destruction of your planet.

865
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:22,593
Yes! The destruction of...

866
00:58:22,676 --> 00:58:25,763
- Say what now?
- Stage Three is ready.

867
00:58:25,971 --> 00:58:27,639
Witness the power

868
00:58:27,723 --> 00:58:33,187
of the Submerged, Limitless,
Underwater Rapid Pump!

869
00:58:34,563 --> 00:58:37,524
The S-L-U-R-P? Slurp?

870
00:58:38,192 --> 00:58:40,694
You must have tried really hard
to make that one work.

871
00:59:08,263 --> 00:59:12,851
<i>The SLURP takes in water,
vaporizing it into outer space,</i>

872
00:59:12,935 --> 00:59:17,314
<i>until the world is left as dry as a desert.</i>

873
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:22,820
A world without water, and it's all my fault!

874
00:59:22,903 --> 00:59:26,907
But you said I would rule the oceans
and you would rule the dry land!

875
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,494
You didn't really think
I would share my kingdom

876
00:59:30,577 --> 00:59:34,248
with a sniveling brat such as yourself?

877
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,965
Poor little Orm!

878
00:59:43,048 --> 00:59:45,884
Always caught in your brother's shadow.

879
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:50,556
Never happy unless you had
a piece of everything he had.

880
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,684
Well, now, you can share in his failure.

881
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:58,856
You have the perfect seat from
which to watch the end of your world.

882
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:19,543
What? What do you think you're doing?

883
01:00:19,793 --> 01:00:21,628
This isn't you, Mera!

884
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,339
- You have to fight it!
- Never!

885
01:00:39,188 --> 01:00:42,149
In brightest day, in blackest night,

886
01:00:42,232 --> 01:00:45,194
no evil shall escape my sight.

887
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:47,988
Let those who worship evil's might

888
01:00:48,071 --> 01:00:51,533
beware my power, Green Lantern's light!

889
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:13,430
Where... Where am I?

890
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:17,226
- Mera, are you okay?
- Green Lantern?

891
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:20,312
What am I doing here? Where is Aquaman?

892
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:23,690
- That was amazing!
- But all those people watching...

893
01:01:23,774 --> 01:01:25,525
How did you overcome your stage fright?

894
01:01:26,068 --> 01:01:27,861
When I saw you two in trouble,

895
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:31,281
I stopped thinking
about myself and just reacted.

896
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:34,576
<i>I'm very proud of you,
Green Lantern Jessica Cruz.</i>

897
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,497
<i>You have now unlocked
the mute option. Engage.</i>

898
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,167
Funny. Now that I can, I don't want to.

899
01:01:42,251 --> 01:01:44,461
<i>I fear I am blushing.</i>

900
01:01:44,628 --> 01:01:47,464
- So is it over?
- Not quite. Look!

901
01:01:55,222 --> 01:01:58,100
I really messed up.

902
01:01:58,183 --> 01:02:00,394
Ormi, how can I help?

903
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:04,982
You still care, after all I've done to you?

904
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:06,066
Why?

905
01:02:06,149 --> 01:02:11,113
Because like it or not, we are family.
And family has to stick together.

906
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:15,158
You're right. You've always been right.

907
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:18,036
I have so many regrets.

908
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,872
Me, too, brother. Me, too.

909
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:23,709
I just wish I was a better hero.

910
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:27,879
I know I'm not the flashiest
League member, or the greatest king.

911
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:31,425
I thought if I just faked it,
I would make it.

912
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:35,429
Instead, I've let everyone down.

913
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:40,017
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

914
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,103
That's kind of you to say,
but if I hadn't given up my crown,

915
01:02:43,186 --> 01:02:45,022
none of this would be happening.

916
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:46,648
They would have found another way.

917
01:02:46,898 --> 01:02:51,028
You are a great king, Aquaman,
and a great hero.

918
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:54,323
It was you that got us out of
the palace through the secret tunnels.

919
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:57,951
You helped us escape the smokestack
and led us to The Watering Hole.

920
01:02:58,035 --> 01:03:00,370
You stood up to Lobo and got us back home.

921
01:03:00,454 --> 01:03:03,874
The fact is, we've taken
you for granted, Aquaman.

922
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:08,003
If anyone can lead us to victory, you can.

923
01:03:10,213 --> 01:03:12,007
You guys are the best.

924
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:16,595
Stand back!
The King of the Sea has work to do!

925
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:25,103
- Is he meditating?
- No. He's calling for help.

926
01:03:25,187 --> 01:03:26,188
Huh?

927
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:27,481
What is that?

928
01:03:27,564 --> 01:03:30,859
It looks like tiny, microscopic plankton.

929
01:03:30,942 --> 01:03:35,781
Correct, Superman.
They are the key to our escape.

930
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,078
Thank you, my friends.

931
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:43,038
Let's do this!

932
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:45,457
Wait, if we got out there like this,

933
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,876
we'll be infected by the Red Lantern rage.

934
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:49,836
Let me handle that.

935
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,179
Excellent. My magic should safeguard us
from the effects of the Lantern.

936
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,601
Brilliant! Now, I'll handle Atrocitus.
You try to stop that machine.

937
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:08,063
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry. I've got his back.

938
01:04:08,271 --> 01:04:10,399
- Together, brother?
- Together!

939
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:16,947
Okay. Try it now.

940
01:04:24,913 --> 01:04:27,207
Argh! The shielding is too thick!

941
01:04:27,374 --> 01:04:31,169
We're never gonna be able to do this.
We're gonna need a miracle.

942
01:04:33,004 --> 01:04:35,757
Batman! The Justice League!

943
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:48,311
Oh! Beautiful sunshine.
I feel better already.

944
01:04:48,937 --> 01:04:52,107
Oh! Am I ever glad to see you!

945
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,568
We're glad to see some
reinforcements up here.

946
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:58,864
Thanks to Green Lantern. Without her,
I'm afraid we'd be dead in the water.

947
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:03,368
Batman, where is Aquaman? Where is Arthur?

948
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,001
It is over, Atrocitus.

949
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:16,423
What?

950
01:05:21,303 --> 01:05:24,222
Take this, you slimy oaf!

951
01:05:26,725 --> 01:05:28,518
Brother!

952
01:05:30,979 --> 01:05:32,272
No!

953
01:05:41,948 --> 01:05:44,409
It's time to sleep with the fishes.

954
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:54,419
Poisedon's Trident!

955
01:05:55,003 --> 01:05:58,924
For the one who is worthy!

956
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:10,227
Enough parlor tricks! Prepare for doom!

957
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:13,730
For Atlantis!

958
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:20,195
For the world!

959
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:40,590
No!

960
01:06:43,093 --> 01:06:44,970
Huh?

961
01:06:57,566 --> 01:07:01,069
Now it is finally over, Atrocitus!

962
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:05,782
For your world. Unfortunately for you,

963
01:07:05,865 --> 01:07:09,244
the SLURP has already been activated,
and cannot be stopped.

964
01:07:09,327 --> 01:07:13,498
All your precious water
is about to be sucked into oblivion.

965
01:07:13,873 --> 01:07:15,792
There has to be a way to stop it.

966
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:20,964
If there is, I'm sure you could find it.
Go! I'll restrain Atrocitus.

967
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:24,384
You have a world to save, my King.

968
01:07:32,475 --> 01:07:35,478
Ocean Master, let us...

969
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:39,024
I think we've heard enough from you!

970
01:07:40,275 --> 01:07:44,863
This is Lois Lane reporting live from
above the water just outside Star City,

971
01:07:44,946 --> 01:07:48,908
where a giant slurping device
is dropping the ocean's water level

972
01:07:48,992 --> 01:07:50,535
at an incredible speed.

973
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:54,456
So far, the Justice League seem
to be unable to dismantle the device.

974
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:00,920
It's no good. Not even
my heat vision can penetrate it.

975
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,259
What are we gonna do?

976
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:08,428
I wish Arthur was here.

977
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:13,266
Arthur! You're okay!

978
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:16,853
I'm fine, Mera. It's good to see you.

979
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,898
I'm sorry for the things I said.
I didn't mean it.

980
01:08:19,981 --> 01:08:22,525
No, Mera. I apologize.

981
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:25,945
I didn't think about how
losing the throne would affect you.

982
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:31,993
You're my wife, my queen.
We rule Atlantis together.

983
01:08:33,787 --> 01:08:37,916
Now, I believe it's time to save the planet!

984
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:40,126
I share your sentiments, Aquaman.

985
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,630
Unfortunately, our weapons
are ineffective against this SLURP.

986
01:08:43,713 --> 01:08:47,092
By themselves, perhaps,
but we can't give up yet.

987
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:52,055
If we concentrate everything we have
on a solitary point at the same time,

988
01:08:52,138 --> 01:08:55,392
then maybe we have a chance. Who's with me?

989
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:59,688
I'm cheering for once. Hurray, or something.

990
01:08:59,771 --> 01:09:02,607
Ready, Justice League?

991
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:04,901
Now!

992
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:25,088
- We moved it!
- Keep going! We can do this!

993
01:09:34,222 --> 01:09:36,766
Fishy's right. We don't have enough power!

994
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,893
We need something more!

995
01:09:43,231 --> 01:09:45,817
How about some more of the Main Man?

996
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,777
I'm back, baby!

997
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,200
Whoo!

998
01:09:54,284 --> 01:09:56,786
I could never stay mad at you, Fishy!

999
01:09:56,953 --> 01:09:58,163
Together!

1000
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:23,605
- Yes! All right!
- We're not done yet!

1001
01:10:49,088 --> 01:10:52,091
It looks like the Justice League,
led by Aquaman,

1002
01:10:52,175 --> 01:10:54,886
have destroyed the device and saved the day!

1003
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:58,556
She's right, you know.
You did lead us to victory.

1004
01:10:58,681 --> 01:11:01,893
I'd say it was more of a team effort.

1005
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:13,363
My good citizens of Atlantis,

1006
01:11:13,488 --> 01:11:15,907
I have done you a great disservice

1007
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,661
by saying the law prevents
Aquaman from being King.

1008
01:11:19,744 --> 01:11:23,081
In fact, the fine print was
something I put in there

1009
01:11:23,164 --> 01:11:26,626
with the help of a clerk named Sal
at an all-night copy center.

1010
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:29,587
- There is no such law.
- Get off the stage!

1011
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,423
And even if there were,
we can see he is worthy,

1012
01:11:32,507 --> 01:11:36,761
because he pulled the Trident
of Poseidon from the great statue.

1013
01:11:36,845 --> 01:11:40,390
So, Aquaman, my brother,

1014
01:11:40,473 --> 01:11:44,269
I give you back the crown
you so richly deserve.

1015
01:11:44,352 --> 01:11:45,645
Thank you...

1016
01:11:57,615 --> 01:11:59,367
Huzzah!

1017
01:12:00,243 --> 01:12:05,957
Thank you. I promise to be the
best king and the best hero I can be,

1018
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,585
to Atlantis and the world!

1019
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:15,216
Now, let us dance!

1020
01:12:29,814 --> 01:12:31,816
Wow. You Atlanteans really
know how to throw a party.

1021
01:12:31,941 --> 01:12:33,776
Thank you, Cyborg.

1022
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:36,321
Well, I'm glad everything turned out okay.

1023
01:12:36,404 --> 01:12:39,741
But what are we gonna do about the
Red Lanterns, Dex-Starr and Atrocitus?

1024
01:12:39,824 --> 01:12:43,328
Leave them to me and Fishy.

1025
01:12:43,536 --> 01:12:45,955
Turns out Oa placed a bounty on their heads,

1026
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:47,999
and I'm meaning to collect.

1027
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:51,252
This isn't the last you've
heard of me. I'll be...

1028
01:12:51,878 --> 01:12:53,129
Ow!

1029
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:54,297
No!

1030
01:12:57,675 --> 01:13:00,053
Thank you for your help, Lobo.

1031
01:13:00,136 --> 01:13:01,679
Yeah, but let's not get mushy.

1032
01:13:01,763 --> 01:13:06,267
Next time I see you yahoos,
I may not be on my best behavior.

1033
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:08,102
So long, chumps!

1034
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:16,527
Cyborg's mobile trouble alert!

1035
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:21,074
It looks like Gorilla Grodd is attacking
the city of Kathmandu in Nepal.

1036
01:13:21,157 --> 01:13:24,243
Did someone say
high-altitude snowy mountains,

1037
01:13:24,327 --> 01:13:27,163
nowhere near any ocean or body of water?

1038
01:13:27,288 --> 01:13:30,667
That sounds like a job for Aquaman.

1039
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,629
Call if you aren't going to be home
for supper.

1040
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:38,007
Sure will. Well, what are we waiting for?

1041
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:39,801
People need our help!
