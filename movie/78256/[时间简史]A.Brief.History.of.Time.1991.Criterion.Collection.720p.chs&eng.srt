

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:46,490
片名：时间简史

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,470
改编自史蒂芬·霍金《时间简史》一书

6
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,880
是先有鸡还是先有蛋？
Which came first the chicken or the egg?

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,180
宇宙有起源吗?
Did the universe have a beginning...

8
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,390
如果有 那么在宇宙之前又是什么？
and if so,what happened before then?

9
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,730
宇宙从何而来
Where did the universe come from...

10
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,980
它又将去向何方？
and where is it going?

11
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,060
运气好 嗯
Luck. Luck. Well...

12
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,770
我们都很幸运
we have been very lucky

13
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,020
我是说 我的家人 史蒂芬和所有人
I mean,my family and Stephen and everybody.

14
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,110
曾经多灾多难 关键是我们生存下来了
You have your disasters,but the point is that we have survived.

15
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,610
每个人都面临着灾难 一些人消失了
Everybody has disasters,and yet some people disappear...

16
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,610
再也见不到了
and are never seen again.

17
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,750
飞弹总是让人绷紧神经
Flying bombs are very alarming.

18
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,920
它们呼啸而来
They came buzzing over...

19
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,970
然后戛然而止
and then they would cut out.

20
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,600
你听到嘭的一声 你知道你没有被炸
And when you heard the bang,you knew it wasn't you...

21
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,010
你继续吃饭或者做其他的事
so you went back to your meal or whatever.

22
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,140
但是真的有个炸弹掉在我们的房子边上
But one did fall quite close to our house...

23
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,690
震破了玻璃
and it blew the back windows out...

24
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,320
碎玻璃片像尖刀一样打到对面的墙上
so that the glass was sticking dagger points all out of the opposite wall.

25
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,820
当史蒂芬要出生时 我们决定
When Stephen was born,we decided. ..

26
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,370
他最好是出生在牛津
He'd better be born in Oxford.

27
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,660
所以当我呆在医院的时候
So while I was staying in the hospital...

28
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,330
我去了牛津的布莱克威尔医院
I went to Blackwell's in Oxford...

29
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,460
我买了一本天文图集
and I bought an astronomical atlas.

30
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,380
我的一个弟媳说
One of my sisters-in-law said...

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,340
"这是你做的很有预见性的一件事"
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."

32
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,470
时间有多真实？
How real is time?

33
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,430
时间有没有终点？
Will it ever come to an end?

34
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,190
过去和未来有什么区别？
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?

35
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,700
为什么我们能回忆起过去
Why do We remember the past. ..

36
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,950
而不是将来？
But not the future?

37
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,370
我还记得那天
I can remember the day...

38
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,500
我们经过伦敦 然后灯火管制刚结束
when we traveled through London and the blackout was over.

39
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,340
火车仍然在行驶
And the trains,instead of being shut in...

40
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,010
通过火车的百叶窗看去
by blinds so that you just traveled in a train...

41
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,220
我们正经过一座座的铁路桥
we were coming over one of the bridges...

42
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,730
看到灯光闪耀 灯光消逝的地方
and all the lights well,such lights as were left

43
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,190
便是伦敦城区 那也是一个星光闪耀的夜晚
were on in London,but it was also a completely starry night...

44
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,110
你能看到那些星光 非常漂亮
and you could see the light. It was beautiful.

45
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,070
我记得我们都常常躺在草坪上 透过望远镜
I remember we all used to lie on the grass,looking straight up through a telescope...

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,410
仰望璀璨的星空
and seeing the wonders of the stars.

47
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,080
史蒂芬总是充满了好奇
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder...

48
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,420
我知道那些星星吸引了他
and I could see that the stars would draw him...

49
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,500
还有比星星还要深远的东西
and further than the stars.

50
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,050
我出生于伽利略逝世
I was born exactly 300 years...

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,600
300周年纪念日
after the death of Galileo.

52
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,270
我估计有二十万婴儿
I estimate that about 200,000 other babies...

53
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,900
在那天出生
were also born that day.

54
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,400
我不知道他们中是否有些人
I don't know whether any of them...

55
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,780
后来对天文学感兴趣
was later interested in astronomy.

56
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,370
我最初的记忆是伊泽贝尔
My first memory is of Isobel...

57
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,290
推着老旧的
pushing a rather antiquated...

58
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,120
马车改装的婴儿车在北方大道上走着
carriage-built pram along North Road...

59
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,790
史蒂芬和玛丽在车内
with Stephen and Mary in it...

60
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,420
看上去非常大
sort of looking very large...

61
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,720
因为他们大大的脑袋 粉红的脸颊 十分引人注目
because they had large heads and pink cheeks,and they were very noticeable.

62
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,140
他们看上去和常人不同
They all looked different from ordinary people.

63
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,890
我记得到霍金家拜访
I can remember visiting the Hawking home...

64
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,810
哦 好多次了
oh,several times.

65
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,690
如果留下来吃晚饭的话
It was the sort of place where,if invited to stay to supper...

66
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,860
你可以 额
you might,uh...

67
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,190
可以和小史蒂芬说说话
be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen...

68
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,110
但是其他家庭成员会坐在
but the rest of the family would be sitting...

69
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,450
桌边阅读
at the table reading a book...

70
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,080
在我的观念里这样做是不允许的
a behavior which was not really approved of in my circle...

71
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,250
但是霍金一家却很宽容
but which was tolerated from the Hawkings...

72
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,540
他们看起来
because they were recognized to be...

73
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,090
非常特别 智商很高
very eccentric,highly intelligent...

74
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,210
非常聪明
very clever people...

75
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,010
但是还是有一点古怪
but still a bit odd.

76
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,470
在我的印象中 霍金家族中
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that...

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,850
只有史蒂芬看上去
except for Stephen,who seemed to be...

78
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,100
是一位正常的成员
the only normal member of the family.

79
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,480
史蒂芬常常猜想自己知道 我认为
Stephen used to reckon he knew,I think it was...

80
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,150
有11条进房间的路线 我只找到10条
11 ways of getting into the house,and I could only find ten.

81
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,950
我不是很确定那一条路在哪里
I'm not sure where the other way was.

82
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,330
房子的北面是一间自行车棚
On the north side of the house was a bicycle shed.

83
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,960
有前后门
It had a door at the front and a door at the back.

84
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,960
车棚上面有个窗户通往L型的房间
Above that,there was a Window into the L-shaped room...

85
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,670
前面有个拐角你可以从那里
and at the front you could get sort of around the corner...

86
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,220
上到屋顶去
onto the roof ..

87
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,050
从那里
And from that level...

88
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,220
你能到达主楼屋顶
you could get onto the main roof.

89
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
我想其中一条路是
I think one of the ways...

90
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,890
史蒂芬可以从主楼屋顶进去
Stephen could get in was on the main roof.

91
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,030
要我说 他比我会爬得多
As I say,he was a much better climber than I was.

92
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,110
我仍然不知道第11条路是什么
I still didn't know what the 11th one was.

93
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,750
在20世纪以前
Before the 20th century...

94
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,000
人们认为宇宙会永远存在
it was thought that the universe had existed forever...

95
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,750
或形成于过去某个时间点
or had been created at some time in the past...

96
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,760
跟我们今天观测到的差不多
more or less as we observe it today.

97
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,090
人们觉得这样很有说服力
People found comfort in the thought...

98
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,060
尽管他们会衰老和死亡
that even though they may grow old and die...

99
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,640
而宇宙是亘古不变的
the universe was eternal and unchanging.

100
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,770
我不再和霍金玩那个游戏
I gave up playing games with Stephen...

101
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,990
哦 那时候他生病了 大概12岁
oh,when he was ill that time when he was about 12...

102
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,870
因为他开始对游戏异常认真
because he started taking games terribly seriously.

103
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,790
我们玩的是《大富翁》
We had Monopoly...

104
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,910
首先
and first of all...

105
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,000
在《大富翁》棋盘上建起贯穿的铁路
the Monopoly board sprang railways going across it. ..

106
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,290
以增加复杂性
To add to the complications...

107
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,260
后来《大富翁》满足不了他的需求
and then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.

108
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,260
他开始玩更可怕的游戏《王朝》
He ended up with a fearful game called Dynasty...

109
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,600
我不会玩这种游戏 我从没玩过
which,as far as I can make out I never played it

110
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,810
他就会一直玩 因为这游戏没有终点
went on forever because there was no way of ending it.

111
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,810
在我看来 快要取代生活了
It was almost a substitute for living,as far as I could make out.

112
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,480
他在游戏上花费一个又一个小时
It took hours and hours and hours.

113
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,940
我认为这是个非常可怕的游戏
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.

114
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,820
我难以想象有人能花这么多时间
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.

115
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,740
但是史蒂芬有很复杂的思维
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind...

116
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,700
我觉得就是因为
and I felt as much as anything...

117
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,330
这种复杂度吸引了他
it was the complication of it that appealed to him.

118
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,670
我高中的时候 我学到
When I was in high school,I learned that light...

119
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,170
来自遥远星系的光会发生红移
from distant galaxies was shifted to the red.

120
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,510
那意味着它们在远离我们
This meant that they were moving away from us...

121
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,970
宇宙在膨胀
and that the universe was expanding.

122
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,510
但是我不相信
But I didn't believe it.

123
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,190
一个静态的宇宙看起来更加自然
A static universe seemed much more natural.

124
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,650
它可能已经存在
It could have existed...

125
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,030
并且永远存在下去
and could continue to exist forever.

126
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,040
我们当时在讨论
We were discussing the possibility...

127
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,120
生命自然产生的可能性
of the spontaneous generation of life...

128
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,710
我认为从史蒂芬的讨论中
and I think that Stephen made a remark...

129
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,130
不仅能看出他已经想到这一点
which indicated not only that he'd thought of this...

130
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,670
他甚至已经
but he'd even also...

131
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,010
对这一过程所需的时间
come across some calculations..

132
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,890
做了一些计算
as to how long it might take.

133
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,680
那一刻
At that time,

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,390
我对其中一位朋友 约翰·麦克莱纳说
I think I made a comment...to one of my friends,John McClenahan...

135
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,100
"我觉得史蒂芬这个人"
"I think that Stephen...

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,650
"能力非凡"
will turn out to be unusually capable."

137
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,270
我不确定我当时就是这么说的
I don't think I put it in quite those words...

138
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,480
但我做了类似这样的评价
but I made some such remark to him...

139
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,400
约翰并不认同
and he disagreed.

140
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,160
所以我们打了个赌
And so we made a bet on the subject.

141
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,240
用我们小时候的方法
In our childish way,we bet...

142
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,040
赌注是一袋糖果
a bag of sweets on the issue.

143
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,580
顺便说一句 我认为我敢赌我是正确的
And incidentally,I reckon that my bet has come correct...

144
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,960
我觉得他该付我赌注
and I think I'm entitled to payment...

145
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,840
虽然我现在还没收到
which has not yet been made.

146
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,430
宇宙膨胀
The expansion of the universe...

147
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,760
暗示着一种可能性
suggested the possibility...

148
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,010
宇宙起源于
that the universe had a beginning...

149
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,430
过去的某个时间点
at some time in the past.

150
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,610
宇宙起源的时间点
The point at which the universe may have started out. ..

151
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,320
被称作大爆炸
Became known as the Big Bang.

152
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,790
他第一年在圣阿尔本兹学校的时候
The first year he was at St. Albans School...

153
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,370
成绩倒数第三名
he came,I think,third from the bottom.

154
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
我对他说 "好吧 史蒂芬"
I said,"Well,Stephen...

155
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,960
"你真的想变得那么差吗"
do you really have to be as far down as that?"

156
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,970
他说道
And he said,"Well...

157
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,590
"很多人都没有做得更好"
a lot of other people didn't do much better."

158
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,800
他一点也不在意
He was quite unconcerned.

159
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,970
不知为何 他总是被认为
Somehow he was always recognized...

160
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,980
很聪明
as being very bright. ..

161
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,810
事实上他有一年获得过神学奖
And in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.

162
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,150
这没有什么奇怪的 因为他爸爸在他很小的时候就常常给他
That was not surprising because his father used to read him...

163
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,360
朗读一些圣经的故事
Bible stories from a very early age...

164
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,660
他对那些故事很熟悉
and he knew them all very well...

165
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,320
他对宗教的一些事非常精通
and he was quite well-versed in religious things...

166
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,250
然而我不认为他是通过大量的练习才熟悉的
although I don't think he makes a great deal of practice of it now.

167
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,330
每个人都会谈论神学
Everybody used to argue theology.

168
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,840
那是一个好的安全的话题
That's a good,safe subject.

169
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,760
你不需要事实或者
You don't need any facts or...

170
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,340
分散注意力
distracting things like that.

171
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,140
如果你参与讨论
If you go in for arguing

172
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,310
你可以愉快地辩论任何事
you know,debating you can quite happily debate about anything...

173
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,770
包括神学
including theology...

174
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,650
上帝存在及其形式
and the existence or otherwise of God.

175
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
一些人会厌倦了
And then someone gets bored ...

176
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,200
就会谈论星际旅行 或者类似这些的
or Journey Into Space comes on,or something like that...

177
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,280
然后讨论到此结束
and the argument breaks up.

178
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,540
在亘古不变的宇宙中
In an unchanging universe...

179
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,250
我们可以想象是上帝于过去的某个时间
one can imagine that God created the universe...

180
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,880
创造了宇宙
at literally any time in the past.

181
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,220
另一方面
On the other hand...

182
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,720
如果宇宙在膨胀
if the universe is expanding...

183
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,100
那可能有物理原因
there may be physical reasons...

184
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,850
为什么一定要有起源呢
why there had to be a beginning.

185
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,230
宇宙的膨胀并不排除创造者
An expanding universe does not preclude a creator...

186
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,230
但是它在上帝是何时创世这方面
but it does place limits...

187
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,780
有局限性
on when he might have carried out his job.

188
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,620
我们一家到了印度
When the family went to India...

189
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,250
史蒂芬也来和我们一起住一年
it was arranged that Stephen should come and live with us for a year.

190
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,750
他认为我们
He decided it would be nice...

191
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,800
晚上应该跳苏格兰舞是很好的
that we should have...Scottish dancing in the evening.

192
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,670
提醒你一下 这是一间很普通的房子
Mind you,this was quite an ordinary house...

193
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,970
但是我们有很多房间和一个大厅
but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall...

194
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,760
我们买了一些唱片
and so we bought some records...

195
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,810
和一本消遣的书
and a book about what to do...

196
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,770
史蒂芬开始主持
and Stephen took charge.

197
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,820
他坚持让你穿夹克打领带
And he insisted you put on a jacket and a tie.

198
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,450
他来当晚会的主持
And then he was the master of the proceedings.

199
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,780
史蒂芬很认真地在做
And Stephen took it very seriously.

200
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,280
但他喜欢跳舞 发现了吗？
But then he liked dancing,you see?

201
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,120
有四位物理学家与我同级
There were four physicists in my year

202
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,130
戈登·贝瑞
Gordon Berry...

203
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,130
里查德·布莱恩
Richard Bryan...

204
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,130
史蒂芬
Stephen...

205
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,090
和我自己
myself.

206
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,890
我对史蒂芬最初的印象是
I first remember Stephen...

207
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,850
有一次 我和戈登吃完饭去史蒂芬的房间
on an occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room...

208
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,310
找他
to try to find him.

209
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,310
史蒂芬正在那里
And Stephen was up there...

210
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,820
那儿有一箱啤酒
with a crate of beer...

211
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,150
慢慢地喝着啤酒
slowly drinking his way through it.

212
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,950
他只有17岁 不允许去酒吧
He was only 17. He couldn't legally go into a pub.

213
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,950
他很小就去了牛津大学读书
He'd gone up to Oxford ridiculously early.

214
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,130
我们常常聚会
We used to have what we called a gathering net.

215
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,420
组织啤酒派对或者类似的活动
We used to organize a beer party and various things like that...

216
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,720
以邀请尽可能多的新生
to gather all these collar as many freshman as we could get...

217
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,890
让他们加入划船俱乐部
to get them to join the Boat Club.

218
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,180
我们就是这样认识他的
And that's how we collected him,you see?

219
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,650
但是史蒂芬的问题是
But the question always with Stephen was...

220
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,240
"我们应该让他做第一批的八个舵手之一"
"Should we make him the cox of the first eight...

221
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,030
"还是第二批？"
or the second eight?"

222
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,660
有些舵手比较冒险
Well,coxes can be adventurous...

223
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,450
有些则很沉稳
and some coxes can be very steady people.

224
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,670
他属于冒险的那一类
He was rather an adventurous type.

225
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,710
你永远也不知道他接下来会干什么
You never knew quite what he was going to do...

226
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
当他和船员一起的时候
when he went out with the crew.

227
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,640
他有时候会想些自己的事情
I think he used to bring his work with him into the boat sometimes.

228
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,980
在船上他思维的齿轮开始转动
His sort of thinking gear was going...

229
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,560
在不同层次上
on different levels.

230
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,070
我们被要求阅读
We were asked to read chapter 10...

231
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,070
一本书的第十章 书名叫电磁学
in a book called Electricity and Magnetism...

232
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,740
由布里尼夫妇所著 一个不太可能的组合
by Bleaney and Bleaney,an unlikely combination

233
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,990
他们是夫妻档
a husband-and-wife team

234
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,370
在第十章的最后部分 有13个问题
and at the end of that chapter,there were 13 questions...

235
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,000
都是具有挑战性的问题
all of them final honors questions.

236
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,460
我很快发现我一个都不会做
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.

237
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,880
理查德和我一起做了一个星期
Richard and I worked together for the week...

238
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,590
我们做出了1道半
and we managed to do 1 1/2 questions...

239
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,680
我们感到很骄傲
which we felt very proud of.

240
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,760
戈登拒绝外援
Gordon refused all assistance...

241
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,140
独立做出了1道题
and managed to do one all by himself.

242
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,020
史蒂芬 像往常一样 甚至还没开始
Stephen,as always,hadn't even started...

243
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,270
但是第二天早上 他9点钟进房间
but the next morning,he went' up to his rooms at 9:00. ..

244
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,820
我们回来是12点 也可能是12点5分
And we came back about 12:00,maybe five past 12:00...

245
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,030
史蒂芬随后也来了 我们在大学门口的长廊碰到
and down came Stephen,and we were in the college gateway,the lodge.

246
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,790
"啊 霍金" 我说 "你做出了多少"
"Ah,Hawking," I said,"how many have you managed to do,then?"

247
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,790
"好吧" 他说 "我只有时间做前十道"
"Well," he said,"I've only had time to do the first ten."

248
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,420
在那一刻 我们认识到我们不仅仅不是一路人
I think at that point we realized that it's not just we weren't in the same street.

249
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,630
我们根本就不是一类人
We weren't on the same planet.

250
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,470
我曾算过
I once calculated...

251
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
我在牛津的三年里
that I did about 1,000 hours' work...

252
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,140
做过1 000个小时的工作
in the three years I was at Oxford

253
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,980
平均每天一小时
an average of an hour a day.

254
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,690
我不会因为不勤于工作而感到骄傲
I am not proud of this lack of work.

255
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,150
我只是在描述我当时的态度
I am just describing my attitude at the time...

256
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,450
当时就觉得没有什么是值得努力的
an attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.

257
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,790
每个星期的课外辅导他都做些研究
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial...

258
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,170
因为他从来不保留笔记
and,as he never kept any notes...

259
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,920
草稿或者类似这些资料
or papers or that sort of thing...

260
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,510
离开我房间的时候 他都把那些会扔到我的垃圾桶里
on leaving my room,he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.

261
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,850
当他和其他一些大学生一起做研究
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial...

262
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,520
他们看到这些时 完全吓坏了
and they saw this happen,they were absolutely horrified...

263
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,060
因为他们认为 他只要半小时就完成的工作
'cause they thought,he did this work in probably half an hour...

264
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,010
如果他们能在一年内完成
If they could have done it in a year,

265
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,690
他们都不会扔到废纸篓里
they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket.

266
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,280
而是把它们裱起来挂到墙上
They would've put it in a frame on their walls.

267
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,200
由于我疏于学习
Because of my lack of work...

268
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,330
我打算解决理论物理的问题
I had planned to get through the final exam...

269
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,660
来通过我的期末考试
by doing problems in theoretical physics...

270
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,540
并避开需要事实性知识的问题
and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.

271
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,840
我做的不是很好
I didn't do very well.

272
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,970
我处在一等和二等学位的边界
I was on the borderline between a first- and second-class degree...

273
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,520
我不得不通过面试来决定我能够获得第几等
and I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.

274
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,310
他们询问我的未来计划
They asked me about my future plans.

275
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,230
我回答到 如果他们给我第一等
I replied,if they gave me a first...

276
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,530
我就会去剑桥大学
I would go to Cambridge.

277
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,410
如果我获得二等学位
If I only got a second...

278
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,910
我就留在牛津
I would stay in Oxford.

279
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,750
他们给了我一等学位
They gave me a first.

280
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,630
我带着史蒂芬和他的弟弟
I drove Stephen and his young brother...

281
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,180
去沃本公园
out to Woburn Park...

282
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
他爬上一棵树
and he climbed a tree.

283
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,100
我想他在测试自己 我没有意识到
He was testing himself out,I think. I didn't realize.

284
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,060
他能够爬树
He did manage to climb a tree...

285
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,230
沿着树枝把自己弄下来
and go along a branch of it and get himself down.

286
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,810
我想他开始认识到自己的双手
I think he began to notice that his hands...

287
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,570
没有曾经那么好用了
were less useful than they had been...

288
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,610
但是他没有告诉我们
but he didn't tell us.

289
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,870
大学里有些垂直的楼梯
Univ has these square staircases...

290
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,660
圆角但却是垂直的
which are round but they're square.

291
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,710
他从一个房间出来
It was just coming down from one of the rooms.

292
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,380
史蒂芬从楼梯上摔了下来
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming downstairs...

293
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,750
一直滚到底部
and kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.

294
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,220
我不知道他是否失去了意识 但他失忆了
I don't know if he lost consciousness,but he lost his memory.

295
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,010
我们把他弄到一个地方 不是我房间也不是别人的房间
We took him to either my room or someone's room.

296
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,600
他第一个问题就问 "我是谁？"
The first question of course was,"Who am I?"

297
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,140
我们告诉他 "你是史蒂芬·霍金"
We told him,"You're Steve Hawking."

298
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,730
接下来他立马又问了一遍 "我是谁？"
Right away he would ask again,"Who am I?"

299
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,610
"史蒂芬·霍金"
"Steve Hawking."

300
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,530
接着 过了几分钟 他想起他是史蒂芬·霍金
Then,after a couple of minutes,he remembered he was Steve Hawking.

301
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,870
然后我们问他 "你还记得星期天晚上"
Then we'd say,"Do you remember going down to the bar...

302
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,330
"你去酒吧喝酒么？"
and having a drink on Sunday night?"

303
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,910
或者 "你还记得星期一我们在河上划船么？"
Or,"Do you remember coxing on the river on Monday?"

304
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,420
他的记忆逐渐恢复了
And his memory came back gradually...

305
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,130
直到他能记起几天前的一些事 然后是几小时前
until he could remember the previous day's events,and then the previous hour...

306
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,170
后来的两个小时他能记起每一件事
and by the end of the two hours,he could remember everything.

307
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,590
问题是 "你可能因为这个损伤了"
The question was,"Well,maybe you've lost...

308
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,680
"一些脑细胞"
some of your mind because of this."

309
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,970
然后史蒂芬说 "这样的话 我要参加门萨考试"
And so Steve decided,"Well,I'll take the Mensa test."

310
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,060
我们回应道 "你一定会进的"
We said,"Of course you'll get in."

311
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,770
他回来很高兴他能够进入门萨
But he came back delighted he was able to get into Mensa.

312
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,860
极其欣喜
Absolutely delighted.

313
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,950
我感觉理论物理
I felt that there were two areas...

314
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,250
有两个领域
of theoretical physics...

315
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,540
我在剑桥可能会研究的两个领域
I might study at Cambridge.

316
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,130
一个是宇宙学 研究宏观
One was cosmology,the study of the very large.

317
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,680
另一个是基本粒子
The other was elementary particles...

318
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,390
研究微观
the study of the very small.

319
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,850
然而 我认为基础粒子
However,I thought elementary particles...

320
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,650
缺乏吸引力
were less attractive...

321
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,820
因为没有合适的理论
because there was no proper theory.

322
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,860
他们所要做的
All they could do...

323
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,070
就是粒子的分类
was arrange the particles in families...

324
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,160
就像植物学
like in botany.

325
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,660
而在宇宙学里 换句话说
In cosmology,on the other hand...

326
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,580
有定义明确的理论
there was a well-defined theory

327
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,050
爱因斯坦的相对论
Einstein's general theory of relativity.

328
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,260
那一年很冷
It was a very cold year...

329
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,690
维鲁拉米恩池塘
and the ice on Verulamium Pond...

330
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,270
都结了冰
it was frozen there...

331
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,690
我们一起出去滑冰
and we all went skating.

332
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,360
史蒂芬滑的相当好
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well...

333
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,950
但是后来 他离我非常的近
but then,he and I were close together.

334
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,160
他滑冰的水平不是很高
He wasn't skating in a very advanced way...

335
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,160
但我会那样滑
but nor was I,if it comes to that.

336
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,000
他摔倒了
He fell...

337
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,290
爬不起来
and he couldn't get up.

338
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,090
我带着他来到咖啡馆暖身
So I took him to a café to warm up...

339
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,710
他告诉我关于这件事的一切
and he told me then all about it.

340
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,510
并且是确诊的
And it was diagnosed.

341
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,930
我坚持要见他的医生
I insisted on going to see his doctor...

342
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,310
因为不管他还能活多久
because it seemed to me however long you're going to live...

343
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,770
我都想知道有没有什么方法或什么人能够帮助他
there's probably something someone can do about it

344
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,860
至少能让人更容易接受
at least anyhow to make things easier for people.

345
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,400
我不想提医生的名字
I won't mention the doctor's name...

346
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,200
我和他在伦敦的诊所见面
but I got to see him at the London Clinic.

347
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,990
他见到我很惊奇 我竟然不辞劳苦地找到他
He was rather surprised that I should bother to come 'round to see him.

348
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,740
毕竟 我只是史蒂芬的母亲
After all,I was only Stephen's mother.

349
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,830
他非常友好 他同意和我正式会面
He was quite nice. He agreed to see me in a rather grand way.

350
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
他说道 "是的 非常抱歉"
And he said,"Yes,it's all very sad.

351
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,960
"才华横溢的年轻人在他的年轻时即将陨落"
Brilliant young man cut off in the prime of his youth."

352
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,590
当然我问 "我们该怎么做？"
But of course I said,"What can we do?

353
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,630
"有什么我们可以做的"
What can we do to sort of

354
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
"需要做理疗么？"
Can we get physiotherapy?

355
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,180
"有没有什么能帮到忙吗？"
Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"

356
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,390
他说 "事实上 没有
He said,"Well,actually,no.

357
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
"真的 我不能帮上一点忙 差不多 就是这样"
There's nothing I can do,really. More or less,that's it."

358
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,400
我21岁生日后不久
Shortly after my 21 st birthday...

359
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,360
我来到医院检查
I went into hospital for tests.

360
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,490
他们取了我的手臂肌肉样本
They took a muscle sample from my arm...

361
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,580
把电极插在我身上
stuck electrodes into me...

362
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,710
把显影剂注入我的脊椎
and injected some radiopaque fluid into my spine...

363
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,710
然后把床倾斜用X光扫描
and watched it going up and down with X-rays...

364
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
从头扫到尾
as they tilted the bed.

365
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,590
我被诊断为ALS
I was diagnosed as having ALS

366
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,640
肌萎缩性脊髓侧索硬化症
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

367
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,100
又叫做运动神经元疾病
or motor neuron disease,as it is also known.

368
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,060
医生没有治疗方案
The doctors could offer no cure...

369
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,650
告诉我只剩下2年半的时间可活
and gave me 21/2 years to live.

370
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,910
我来到毕业生休息室
I went into the graduates' common room...

371
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,750
找有谁能一起吃饭的
looking,really,for someone to have lunch with.

372
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,130
没有人我期望的那样能够陪我一起吃午饭
There was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with...

373
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,050
这时 史蒂芬进了房间
and then Stephen walked through the door.

374
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,760
我不知道他在牛津干什么 我已经忘记了
I don't know what he was doing at Oxford. I've certainly forgotten now.

375
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,430
史蒂芬慷慨地出去
And so Stephen generously went off...

376
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,510
买了些喝的
to buy the drinks...

377
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,930
带回来放在桌子上
and brought them and put them on the table.

378
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,350
他放下一品脱啤酒
And as he put his pint of beer down...

379
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,270
他分了一下
he spilled it.

380
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,610
我高兴地说
I sort of said genially...

381
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,070
"哦 老天 尽情喝吧"
"Oh,heavens. Drinking at this time of day!"

382
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,610
然后他告诉我 他在阿登布鲁克有三个星期了
He then told me he'd been in Addenbrooke's for three weeks...

383
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,120
他们做了一系列的检查
and they'd done a whole series of tests...

384
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,910
诊断出
and they'd decided...

385
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,950
他得了什么病
what was wrong with him.

386
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,000
他很平静的告诉我
And he told me very straight and flat...

387
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,710
他将渐渐地不能掌控
that he was gradually going to lose...

388
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,380
自己的身体
the use of his body...

389
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,880
到最后
that eventually...

390
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,140
只有心脏和肺
only his heart and his lungs...

391
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,680
大脑还能工作
would still be operating,and his brain...

392
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,890
他们告诉他
and that they'd told him that...

393
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,270
最终基本上全部瘫痪
eventually he would essentially have the body of a cabbage...

394
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,770
但是他仍然能够很好思考
but his mind would still be in perfect working order...

395
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,490
他将无法和别人交流
and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.

396
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,030
那时候我很迷茫
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.

397
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,000
在我被确诊之前
Before my condition had been diagnosed...

398
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,830
我对生活非常厌倦
I had been very bored with life.

399
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,170
好像没有什么可以值得做的
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.

400
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,340
但是当我从医院出来的一瞬间
But shortly after I came out of hospital...

401
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,100
我想我快要完蛋了
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.

402
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,980
我突然意识到我还有很多值得做的事
I suddenly realized there were a lot of worthwhile things...

403
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,020
如果还有时间的话
I could do if I were reprieved.

404
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,030
我完全理解 他失去了信念
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith...

405
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,830
然后
and...

406
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,330
对我而言 那让我心里更加难受
to me,that made it the more difficult...

407
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,210
因为一般人遭遇这种悲剧都会问自己 "为什么偏偏是我？
because you must ask yourself,"Why me?

408
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,550
"偏偏是这种病？偏偏在我正值青春的时候？"
Why this? Why now?"

409
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,130
但他不同 他就那么完全坦然地接受了
But he just totally,flatly accepted...

410
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,800
接受了即将发生的事情
that this was what was going to happen to him.

411
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,970
据我推测 那时候他开始了一些工作
As far as I can gather,at that point he started to do some work.

412
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,770
一开始 我并不觉得我的研究
At first,there did not seem much point...

413
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,940
能有什么意义
in working at my research...

414
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,820
因为我根本没指望活到能够
because I didn't expect to live long enough...

415
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,900
完成我的博士学位
to finish my PhD.

416
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,660
然而 时间一天天过去
However,as time went by...

417
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,240
看上去 似乎病情进展延缓了
the disease seemed to slow down.

418
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,580
我开始能理解广义相对论
I began to understand general relativity...

419
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,000
还在工作中取得了一些进展
and made progress with my work.

420
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,710
不过 一直以来真正支撑着我的是
But what really made a difference was...

421
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,090
我那时已经与一位叫简·王尔德的姑娘订了婚
I had got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.

422
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
她是我生命的支柱
This gave me something to live for...

423
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,600
同时 这也意味着我得找份工作
but it' also meant I had to get a job...

424
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,020
如果我真心想和她结婚
if we were to get married.

425
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,440
史蒂芬那时已经确诊 简也清楚地知道
Stephen was already ill. Jane knew it.

426
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,400
这是史蒂芬又一个幸运之处
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck,you know

427
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,240
在对的时间遇见对的人
meeting the right person at the right time...

428
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,540
你想想 史蒂芬那时无比沮丧
because Stephen was very,very badly depressed...

429
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,160
并不怎么情愿继续他的工作
and he wasn't very much inclined to go on with his work.

430
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,630
他被告知生命只剩两年半的时间
He'd been told he's only got 2 and a half years.

431
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,790
在那种境况下你能做什么
What can you do in that time?

432
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,670
然而与简的相遇给他注入了勇气
But meeting Jane really put him on his mettle...

433
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
接下来 他又开始了工作
and he started to work.

434
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,680
我曾想探寻
I wanted to understand...

435
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,810
宇宙是如何起源的
how the universe began.

436
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,940
爱因斯坦的广义相对论
Einstein's theory of general relativity...

437
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,940
表明宇宙正在膨胀
showed that the universe was expanding.

438
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,990
但并没有一个答案来直接回答最关键的问题
But there was no answer to the crucial question...

439
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,700
"一定要有一个大爆炸"
"Must there have been a Big Bang...

440
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,780
"来开启时间的进程吗？"
a beginning to time?"

441
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,960
然后 当我在剑桥上三年级时
Then,in my third year at Cambridge...

442
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,710
罗杰·彭罗斯有了关于
Roger Penrose made his discovery...

443
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,460
恒星死亡的发现
about the death of stars.

444
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,670
我记得和一位朋友 艾弗·罗宾逊的讨论
I remember talking to this friend,Ivor Robinson...

445
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,140
那次讨论真是一场思想的碰撞
and we were having this animated conversation...

446
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,470
后来我们得过一条马路
and then we had to cross a road...

447
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,520
当然 我们过马路的时候 谈话中断了
and as we crossed the road,of course,the conversation stopped...

448
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
然后我们到了路的另一边
and then we got to the other side.

449
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,400
很碰巧的是 我在过马路的时候想出一个点子
Evidently,I had some idea crossing the road...

450
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,530
但接下来我们了捡起之前的话题 那个点子就从我脑子里不翼而飞了
but then the conversation started up,and it got completely blotted out of my mind.

451
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,700
直到晚些时候 在朋友回家之后
It was only later,after my friend had gone home...

452
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,290
我突然感到一阵奇妙的兴奋
and I began to have this strange feeling of elation

453
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,250
那感觉妙极了
feeling wonderful.

454
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,710
我不知道自己当时为何那样 于是我向前梳理这一天的思绪
I couldn't figure out why I should feel like that,so I went back over the day...

455
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,050
回想究竟是什么事情让我产生了这种感觉
thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling...

456
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,050
后来我慢慢挖掘出这个想法
and then gradually I unearthed this thought...

457
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,180
就是在大街上的那个
which I'd had while crossing the street.

458
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,390
当时彭罗斯告诉我这个结论
Penrose announced this result...

459
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,260
当恒星无限坍缩时
that when stars collapse indefinitely...

460
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,430
他们会变得奇异
they will become singular...

461
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,940
只需要满足一些很宽松的条件就会这样
as long as some very broad conditions are satisfied...

462
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,820
很多人都同意这一点
that everybody would have regarded as reasonable.

463
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,610
我记得史蒂芬·霍金当时快要三年级了
And I remember Stephen Hawking,who was then approaching...

464
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,200
他还是研究生 他说
his third year as a research student,saying...

465
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,410
"多有趣的结果"
"What very interesting results.

466
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,700
"我很好奇是否能应用它们"
I wonder whether they could be adapted...

467
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,620
"来理解宇宙的起源"
to understanding the origin of the universe."

468
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,290
他脑子里想的是 如果你像这样想像
And what he had in mind,you see,was that if,just mentally...

469
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,460
让时光倒流
you reverse the sense of time...

470
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,800
那么这个正在膨胀的宇宙就会变成一个坍缩中的系统
you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system.

471
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,880
这就像一个异常巨大的恒星正在坍缩
It's a bit like a very giant star collapsing.

472
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,050
罗杰·彭罗斯证明了
Roger Penrose proved...

473
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,390
一个垂死的恒星会在其自身重力的作用下坍缩
that a dying star,collapsing under its own gravity...

474
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:57,180
最后变成一个奇点
eventually shrinks to a singularity

475
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,770
一个拥有无穷大密度而没有体积的点
a point of infinite density and zero size.

476
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,450
我意识到 如果我颠倒时间进行的方向
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time...

477
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,620
那么这个坍缩的过程就变成膨胀
so that the collapse became an expansion...

478
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,580
于是我就能证明
I could prove that...

479
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,790
宇宙确实是有起源的
the universe had a beginning.

480
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,380
然而 我的证明
But my proof...

481
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,130
是建立在爱因斯坦广义相对论的基础上
based on Einstein's theory of general relativity...

482
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,630
这同时也表明我们无法理解
also showed that we cannot understand...

483
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,140
宇宙究竟是如何起源的
how the universe began...

484
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,430
因为它表明 所有的科学理论
because it showed that all scientific theories...

485
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,980
包括广义相对论本身
including general relativity itself...

486
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,730
都会在宇宙起源时分崩离析
break down at the beginning of the universe.

487
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,160
我们在纽约的空间物理研究院
We had this meeting...

488
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,330
召开了一次会议
at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.

489
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,380
我说 "在我们得到最终结果前"
I said,"Before we reach a final conclusion...

490
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,210
"我们得把另一样东西扔进"
we ought to throw into the pot...

491
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,380
"这个大熔炉"
still another object

492
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,760
"一个因重力而完全坍缩的物体"
a gravitationally completely collapsed object.

493
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,010
"哦 当你使用了这么一个说法"
Well,after you've used the phrase...

494
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,680
"一个因重力而完全坍缩的物体" 十遍之后
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object" ten times...

495
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,900
你会意识到最好给它起个名字
you conclude you've got to get a better name.

496
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,150
正是那时候我想到了这么一个词
So that's when I switched...

497
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,520
"黑洞"
to the word "black hole."

498
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,400
"黑洞" 这个约翰·惠勒灵光一闪想到的词 应运而生
The word "black hole," which John Wheeler coined,suddenly caught on.

499
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,780
从此以后 每个人都接受了它
Everybody adopted it,and from then on...

500
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,740
全世界所有的人 不论身处莫斯科
people around the world in Moscow...

501
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,330
美国
in America...

502
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,330
英国 还是什么地方
in England and elsewhere

503
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,330
都知道了他们一直以来谈论的都是同一个东西
could know they were speaking about the same thing.

504
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,550
情况远不止如此 突然之间
And not only that,but suddenly...

505
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,420
所有这些奇思妙想都传达给了公众
the whole range of concepts got through to the general public...

506
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,470
而且科幻小说家们一下子都能谈论
and even science-fiction writers all of a sudden...

507
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,550
有关黑洞的一切
could talk about it.

508
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,470
今晚 我的朋友们
Tonight,my friends...

509
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,270
我们一同站在宇宙探索中
we stand on the brink of a feat unparalleled...

510
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,440
一个无与伦比的胜利旁
in space exploration.

511
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,730
如果我的穿梭机所取回的数据
If the data on my returning probe ship...

512
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,280
与理论计算结果相符
matches my computerized calculations...

513
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,030
我就要亲身探索从未有人胆敢到达的地方
I will travel where no man has dared to go.

514
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,540
进入黑洞吗？
Into the black hole?

515
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,250
进入
In...

516
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,080
穿过
through...

517
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,250
一路向前
and beyond.

518
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,130
为什么 这太疯狂了
Why,that's crazy!

519
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,760
哈 这不可能
Ha! Impossible!

520
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,930
质量巨大的恒星收缩时
As a massive star contracts...

521
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,470
它的重力会变得如此之强
its gravity becomes so strong...

522
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,440
以至于连光都不再能逸出
that light can no longer escape.

523
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,570
依任何物质都无法逃离的边界划定一个范围
The region from which nothing can escape...

524
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,110
它的内部就是黑洞
is called a black hole...

525
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,530
而它的边界就是所谓的事件视界
and its boundary is called the event horizon.

526
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,950
你不妨这么看待事件视界
One might say of the event horizon...

527
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,040
像丹特所说 如同地狱的入口
what Dante said of the entrance to hell

528
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,210
"汝等进入此地 须弃绝一切所望"
"Abandon all hope,ye who enter here."

529
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,130
我曾被邀请
I was once asked to actually...

530
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,470
作为评审员
be an adjudicator...

531
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,470
来审核这样一篇论文
on an essay of which the subject was...

532
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,310
"如何进入一个黑洞并且生存下来"
"How to fall through a black hole and live."

533
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,520
审核它的困难在于 我不知道
Now,the problem I had was that I wouldn't know...

534
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,650
怎样才能把奖颁给它
how to give out the prize...

535
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,150
因为 如果我说 "这文章看起来不错"
because if I said,"That looks like a good essay"...

536
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,150
那么唯一能证实它的方法就是
the only real way of showing this was right...

537
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,240
如文章所说 真的去做这么一个实验 进入黑洞
was to actually follow it,to do the experiment and fall in.

538
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,330
可是 进入黑洞之后呢
But then,having fallen in

539
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,580
我觉得把这文章的作者一起带进黑洞是个好主意
I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you

540
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,920
问题在于 你俩要如何把结果告诉世界上的其他人？
the question would be,how do you tell the rest of the world?

541
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,630
要不要把颁给他们的奖带着
Do you take the prize in that you give to them...

542
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,420
而且他们进入到中心之后怎么办？
and what do they do with it when they get to the center?

543
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,630
相信我
Believe me...

544
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,680
我已等待多时 等一个你这样的人
I've been waiting a long time for someone like you...

545
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,680
来记录这个伟大的时刻
to record this moment.

546
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,430
谢谢你 博士
Thank you,Doctor.

547
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,270
我准备好了
Then I'm ready.

548
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,400
为人类最伟大的航行 我已经就绪
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.

549
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,730
显然也是最冒险的
Certainly his riskiest.

550
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,860
风险是多么的微不足道
The risk is incidental compared to...

551
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,080
获得有关未知的伟大真理的可能就在眼前
the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.

552
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,370
就在那里
There...

553
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,370
自然的普适规则
long-cherished laws of nature...

554
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,670
将会被打破
simply do not apply.

555
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,460
它们灰飞烟灭
They vanish.

556
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,710
那生命呢？
And life?

557
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,840
生命？
Life?

558
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,470
生命永恒
Life forever.

559
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,710
如果你观察一名宇航员
If you were watching an astronaut...

560
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,000
莽撞地跳进一个黑洞
foolhardy enough to jump into a black hole...

561
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,670
这时候他手表上的时间是
at some time on his watch

562
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,840
比如说 12:00
say,12:00

563
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,590
他接下来穿过事件视界
he would cross the event horizon...

564
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,970
然后进入黑洞
and enter the black hole.

565
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,600
可是不论你等多久
But no matter how long you waited...

566
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,440
你都永远不会看到他的手表走到12点
you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12:00.

567
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,110
理论上发生的是 手表上的每一秒
Instead,each second on the watch...

568
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,030
都会看起来越来越长
would appear to take longer and longer...

569
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,820
直到午夜前的最后一秒
until the last second before midnight...

570
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,070
它会持续到永远
would take forever.

571
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,620
因此 如果一个人要跳进黑洞
Thus,by jumping into a black hole...

572
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,460
他可以肯定 自己的形象会永远存在
one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.

573
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,880
但图像会迅速地消逝
But the picture would fade very rapidly...

574
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,970
并且变得模糊不清 谁都看不见
and grow so dim that no one could see it.

575
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,430
当一个人消失在黑洞中时
As somebody disappears into a black hole...

576
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,480
如果从外面观察 就会发现
as seen from the outside,it looks as though...

577
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,650
时间似乎变慢了 这个移动着的人
time actually slows down,and the person who's moving

578
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,150
至少他认为自己在移动
at least he's thinking he's moving...

579
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,110
他也许正在飞船中以正常的语速讲话
he's perhaps talking in his spaceship at a normal rate

580
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,150
但听起来是变慢了 最后在某一个特定的位置
seems to slow down and ends up being frozen...

581
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,990
被冻结起来
in a particular position...

582
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,870
从视界外观察就是如此
as seen by somebody watching him from the outside.

583
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,290
而且你永远不会看见他冻结之后发生的事情
And as seen from the outside,you never see what happens after that.

584
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,220
那个宇航员自己 则什么都不会注意到
The astronaut wouldn't notice anything special...

585
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,430
当他的手表到达午夜时
when his watch reached midnight. ..

586
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,100
他就穿过视界
And he crossed the event horizon...

587
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,270
进入黑洞
into the black hole...

588
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,190
直到他最终抵达奇点
until,of course,he approached the singularity...

589
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,690
被挤成肉泥
and was crushed into spaghetti.

590
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,120
人在穿越视界时
One can fall through this event horizon...

591
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,040
不会感觉到异样 甚至不知道自己穿越了视界
without feeling anything,without noticing it.

592
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,580
大约一周的坠落之后 人会觉得自己被什么东西捏着
After about a week of falling,one begins to feel the pinch...

593
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,380
变得越来越长
and one extends longer and longer...

594
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,670
而且稍稍变瘦
and gets slightly thinner.

595
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,420
接下来 当然 他开始被挤扁
And,of course,one begins to get squeezed...

596
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,550
直到他变得又细又长
until one gets very long and very thin...

597
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,890
让人看不下去
and rather nasty.

598
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,310
大概在第二个周末 他该已经落入了黑洞的中心 而且必死无疑
By the end of two weeks,one's fallen right into the center and is,of course,dead.

599
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,890
当外面的世界渐渐从你的视野中消失的时候
Before you lose sight of the outer world...

600
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,190
你能看到未来的事情发生 而且进行的越来越快
you would see things happening and see them at a greater rate...

601
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,900
看起来就像电影胶片
so that it would look like a firework display.

602
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,400
不过令人沮丧的是 尽管你能看见
The frustration would be that,although you would be able to see...

603
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,570
未来的事情一件件发生在你眼前 但是它们发生得太快
everything that happens in the future,it would be going so fast...

604
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,240
以至于 科学地来说 你根本没时间你分析它们
that from a scientific point of view,you'd have no time to analyze it.

605
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,410
甚至来不及看清楚
You wouldn't be able to take it in.

606
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,710
最后事情会进行得飞快
Eventually things would be going off so fast...

607
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,630
爆炸的力量也越来越强
and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be...

608
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,210
最终你被爆炸撕裂 然后一切都没有了
destroyed by the explosion,and that would be the end.

609
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,090
如果能以这么种方式结束自己的生命 想想还很激动呢
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.

610
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,640
说真的 如果有得选 我肯定会这样
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.

611
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,730
在宇宙的漫长历史中
In the long history of the universe...

612
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,520
许多恒星都用尽了核反应燃料
many stars must have burned up their nuclear fuel...

613
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,110
最后坍缩成一团
and collapsed in on themselves.

614
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,160
实际上黑洞的数量
The number of black holes may be greater...

615
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,660
也许要大于可见的恒星
than the number of visible stars...

616
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,370
一共约有1000亿个黑洞
which totals about a hundred thousand million...

617
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,450
这还只算了我们银河系而已
in our galaxy alone.

618
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,130
我们也得到一些证据
We also have evidence...

619
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,210
证据表明在我们的星系中心
that there is a very large black hole...

620
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,300
有一个无比巨大的黑洞
at the center of our own galaxy.

621
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,230
朋友们问我 "那个 如果黑洞是黑的"
Friends ask me,"Well,if a black hole is black...

622
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,350
"你要怎么看到它呢？"
how can you see it?"

623
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,110
于是我就说 "你总该去过舞会的吧？"
And I say,"Have you ever been to a ball?

624
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,570
"舞会上那些"
Have you ever watched the young men...

625
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,200
"穿着黑色燕尾服的年轻男子"
dressed in their black evening tuxedos...

626
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,490
"和着白色礼服的姑娘们"
and the girls in their white dresses...

627
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,660
"手拉着手转圈"
whirling around,held in each other's arms...

628
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,790
"当灯光暗下来后"
and the lights turned low...

629
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,500
"你就只能看到姑娘们了"
and all you can see is the girls?

630
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,540
"打个比方 如果一个女孩子是一颗普通的恒星"
Well,the girl is the ordinary star...

631
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,590
"而男子是一个黑洞"
and the boy is the black hole.

632
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,800
"尽管你不能看到男子 正如你无法看到黑洞"
You can't see the black hole any more than you can see the boy...

633
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,640
"但那个转着圈的姑娘能让你确信"
but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence...

634
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,680
"一定另有什么拉着她转圈"
there must be something there holding her in orbit."

635
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,690
有天晚上 我的女儿露西刚出生不久
One evening,shortly after the birth of my daughter,Lucy...

636
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,650
上床之前
I started to think about black holes...

637
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,860
我开始思考黑洞
as I was getting into bed.

638
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,330
我的身体缺陷让上床这一过程十分缓慢
My disability makes this rather a slow process...

639
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,660
所以我有的是时间
so I had plenty of time.

640
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,670
突然之间 我意识到
Suddenly I realized...

641
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,290
事件视界的面积
that the area of the event horizon...

642
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,090
必须随着时间的流逝而增大
must always increase with time.

643
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,930
视界面积的增大
The increase in the area of the event horizon...

644
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,220
很容易让人联想到一个叫做熵的物理量
was very reminiscent of a quantity called entropy...

645
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,100
它用来度量一个系统的混乱程度
which measures the degree of disorder of a system.

646
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,940
这其实是一种常识
It is a matter of common experience...

647
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,320
如果你把一些东西放任不管
that disorder tends to increase with time...

648
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,110
它们会倾向于变得无序
if things are left to themselves.

649
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,290
有天 雅各布·贝肯斯坦走进办公室
Jacob Bekenstein came into the office one day.

650
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,540
"雅各布啊" 我说
"Jacob," I said...

651
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,710
"有件事我总是想不清楚"
"lt always troubles me...

652
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,040
"当我把一杯热茶放在一杯凉茶边上时"
when I put a hot teacup next to a cold teacup.

653
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,670
"通过让热量从一个杯子转移到另一个上"
I've increased,by letting heat flow from one to the other...

654
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,050
"我增大了宇宙的混乱度"
the amount of disorder in the universe.

655
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,720
"但是 雅各布 如果一个黑洞恰好经过"
But Jacob,if a black hole swims by...

656
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,220
"这时候我把两杯茶都扔进去"
and I drop both teacups into this...

657
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,890
"我岂不是就隐藏了我让熵增大的证据 是吗？"
I've concealed the evidence of my crime,have I not?"

658
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,070
贝肯斯坦是个十分严谨的人
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity...

659
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,490
他当时看起来很疑惑 不过一会儿他就回来了
and he looked troubled,and he came back to me later...

660
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,900
"不 你没有" 他开口说
and he said,"No,you have not...

661
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,740
"这样并不能掩饰你之前的所作所为"
concealed the evidence of your crime.

662
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,410
黑洞会记录下你行为的痕迹"
The black hole records what's happened to you."

663
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,330
史蒂芬·霍金读了
Stephen Hawking read the paper...

664
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,960
贝肯斯坦在其中声明了这个结论的论文之后
in which Bekenstein announced this result...

665
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,090
觉得它太荒谬了
Thought it was preposterous...

666
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,800
他决定要证明它是错的
and decided to prove it was wrong.

667
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640
我的发现让雅各布·贝肯斯坦做了如下假设
My discoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest...

668
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,930
事件视界的面积
that the area of the event horizon...

669
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,310
实际上就是一个黑洞的熵
actually was the entropy of a black hole.

670
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,820
但是 这个假设有一个致命的缺陷
But there was one fatal flaw. ..

671
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,150
在贝肯斯坦看来
In Bekenstein's idea:

672
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,990
如果黑洞有熵
If black holes have an entropy...

673
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,660
那么它们就得有温度
they ought to have a temperature.

674
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,080
而如果黑洞有温度
And if they have a temperature...

675
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,790
那么他们就有辐射
they ought to give off radiation.

676
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,340
可是 既然任何东西都不能逃离黑洞
But how could they give off radiation...

677
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,720
为什么黑洞会有辐射呢？
if nothing can escape from a black hole ?

678
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,470
不过最后证明
As it turned out...

679
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,180
贝肯斯坦基本上是正确的
Bekenstein was basically correct...

680
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,180
但却是以一种让人惊异的方式
though in a manner far more surprising...

681
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,150
这方式超出任何人 包括他本人 的意料之外
than he or anyone else had expected.

682
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,280
当他的双手慢慢失去运动能力时
As he gradually lost the use of his hands...

683
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,030
他不得不开始
he had to start developing

684
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,040
精心挑选研究项目
carefully choosing research projects...

685
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,370
那些只需要在脑袋里进行几何运算
that could be tackled and solved...

686
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,790
就能处理好的项目
through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.

687
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,340
此外 他还发展了一套非常强力的工具 其他任何人都不曾有过
And he developed a very powerful set of tools nobody else really had.

688
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,260
在某种程度上 当你失去一套工具时
So in some sense,when you lose one set of tools...

689
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,760
你能发展出另一套工具 不过新的工具
you may develop other tools,but the new tools...

690
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,770
能解决的难题是和之前那套工具不同的
are amenable to different kinds of problems than the old tools.

691
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,190
而如果世上掌握这套工具的人只有你一个
And if you're the only master in the world of these new tools...

692
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,730
那么有些问题只有你能解决 其他人都无能为力
that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.

693
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,570
直到1973年
My work up to 1973...

694
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,990
我的工作都在广义相对论的范畴内
was in general relativity...

695
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,330
它们被总结在一本我与乔治·埃利斯合著的书中
and was summarized in a book I wrote with George Ellis called...

696
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,370
大尺度下的时空结构
The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time.

697
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,210
那时候 书写对我而言已经很艰难了
Even then,it was difficult for me to write things down...

698
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,510
所以我更倾向于以图形和图表的形式
so I tended to think in pictures and diagrams...

699
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,100
在脑海中进行思考
that I could visualize in my head.

700
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,510
我记得那次探望史蒂芬和简的经历
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane...

701
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,840
他们那时还住在剑桥
at their home in Cambridge.

702
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,930
晚饭过后
After supper in the evening...

703
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,220
当史蒂芬要上床休息时
when it was time for Stephen to go to bed...

704
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:35,060
简坚持 而史蒂芬也默认 我猜这是通常的情况
Jane insisted and Stephen acquiesced I guess this was standard

705
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,150
史蒂芬自己尝试上楼梯
that Stephen make his way up

706
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,570
我已经记不清是一层还是两层楼梯
I've forgotten whether it was one flight of stairs or two alone...

707
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:43,490
这一时期 霍金已经不再能行走
and this was a period when he could no longer walk.

708
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,280
他是这么上楼的 他抓住楼梯栏杆的柱子
The way he got up the stairs was,he grabbed hold of the pillars...

709
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,490
把自己拉上去
that support the banister and pulled him up with the strength

710
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,620
用自己上肢的力量把自己拉起来
pulled himself up the stairs with the strength of his own arms...

711
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,670
一级一级地向上拉
dragging himself up...

712
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,500
从一楼到二楼
from the ground floor up to the second story...

713
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,340
好像花了一辈子的时间 缓慢而艰难
in a long,arduous effort.

714
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,260
简解释说
Jane explained that...

715
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,050
这是他物理疗法的一个重要部分
this was an important part of his physical therapy...

716
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,270
能够尽量保持他的协调能力
to maintain his coordination...

717
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,810
还有肌肉力量
and strength as long as possible.

718
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,440
刚开始的时候 我看得心痛不已
At first it was sort of heartrending...

719
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,190
看着他艰难地拉着自己一步步上楼
to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling himself up the stairs...

720
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,030
后来我意识到 这就是生命的一部分
until I understood it's just part of life...

721
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,620
像那样拖着自己上楼梯
pulling himself up the stairs like that.

722
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,710
广义相对论被视为
General relativity is what is called...

723
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,750
一种经典理论
a classical theory.

724
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,050
它预言 每个粒子
It predicts a single definite path...

725
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,130
都只有唯一确定的路径
for each particle.

726
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,300
但根据量子力学
But according to quantum mechanics...

727
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,720
存在一种概念叫做概率或者说不确定性
there is an element of chance or uncertainty.

728
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,890
在时空中
A particle does not have...

729
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,400
一个粒子并不只有唯一的路径
just a single path through space and time.

730
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,740
相反 有这么一个不确定原理
Instead,there is an uncertainty principle...

731
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,070
它表明 一个粒子的准确位置
according to which both the exact position...

732
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,030
和准确速度永不可能同时知道
and velocity of a particle can never be known.

733
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,130
我开始研究
I began investigating...

734
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,260
黑洞附近的粒子上
the effect quantum mechanics might have...

735
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,720
的量子力学效应
on particles near a black hole.

736
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,720
我发现 粒子实际上
I found that particles could escape...

737
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,890
是可以逃离黑洞的
from a black hole...

738
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,060
因此 黑洞并不完全是黑的
that black holes are not completely black.

739
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,400
一开始连我自己都无法相信这一点
At first I didn't believe it.

740
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,650
但当我又做了一遍计算之后
But when I redid the calculations...

741
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,740
我发现量子力学的这种效果是无法摆脱的
I couldn't get the effect to go away.

742
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,700
我见了马丁·李斯一面 他兴奋得都在颤抖
I met Martin Rees,and he was shaking with excitement...

743
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,160
他说 "你听说了没？那个"
and he said,"Have you heard? Have you heard...

744
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,000
"史蒂芬刚刚发现的东西？"
what Stephen has discovered?

745
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,960
"所有一切都不同了 都颠覆了 "
Everything is different! Everything is changed!"

746
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,630
我对自己的发现仍抱有怀疑
I was still unsure of my discovery...

747
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,960
所以我只告诉了少数几个同事
so I only told a few colleagues...

748
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,720
不过消息传得飞快
but word soon spread.

749
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,260
罗杰·彭罗斯在我生日当天打来电话
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.

750
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,980
他兴奋之极 跟我聊得根本停不下来
He was very excited and went on so long...

751
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,480
于是我的生日晚宴就被冷落了
that my birthday dinner got quite cold.

752
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,610
真遗憾 晚宴上有鹅肉诶
It was a great pity,because it was goose...

753
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,900
我超喜欢的
which I'm very fond of.

754
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,780
对我而言 那简直就是个奇迹 因为计算过程复杂又混乱
To me it's a miracle,'cause it's a complicated and messy calculation.

755
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,830
当今这个时代我们再做这事儿就会顺手得多
We can now do these things very much better...

756
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,200
而且发生的事情看起来更加明晰
and it's more transparent what happens.

757
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,500
从这些混乱的计算中 他得出的结论是
But out of this messy calculation,he showed that black holes...

758
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,920
黑洞在量子力学效应下 并不是黑的
aren't black with this quantum mechanical effect.

759
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,170
宇宙中存在一种背景辐射
There was a residual radiation.

760
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,340
史蒂芬参加一次会议
Stephen came to a meeting...

761
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,050
人群一阵骚动
and people were flabbergasted.

762
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,680
我记得有人说 "史蒂芬你肯定错了"
I remember someone saying,"You must be wrong,Stephen.

763
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,680
"你的理论我一句话都不信"
I don't believe a word of it."

764
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,600
我曾经说过
I once said that I was unhappy...

765
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,850
对粒子负能量子的产生的解释让我很不满意
with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.

766
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,020
不过 我觉得这是科学思辩的一部分
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.

767
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,190
你必须有所取舍 我很开心自己参与了这场思辩
You must have the give and take,and I'm delighted to be a part of that.

768
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
这是个很有趣的过程
That's what makes it fun.

769
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,200
当人们的脑子里萦绕着闹人的疑惑时
If you all sat down and said,"Oh,lovely"...

770
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,700
如果所有人都试图忽略他们
when you do have niggling questions in your mind...

771
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,000
那么这实际上对科学毫无意义的
that's not doing a service to science.

772
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,040
不过我对这并不抵触
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way...

773
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,380
除非脑子里不安生的人是我
except for that one time when I questioned.

774
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,130
最终我说服自己
I finally convinced myself...

775
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,220
黑洞确实有辐射
that black holes radiate...

776
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,010
我找到一种黑洞辐射的机制
when I found a mechanism through which this could happen.

777
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,390
根据量子力学
According to quantum mechanics...

778
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,440
空间充满虚粒子
space is filled with virtual particles...

779
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,440
和反粒子
and antiparticles...

780
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,690
它们成对地以实物形式存在
that are constantly materializing in pairs...

781
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,900
分离然后靠近
separating,coming together again...

782
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,320
共同湮灭
and annihilating each other.

783
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,080
在黑洞附近
In the presence of a black hole...

784
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,040
上述一对虚粒子中的一个
one member of a pair of virtual particles...

785
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,120
可能落进黑洞
may fall into the hole...

786
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,840
这样剩下在外面的一个就失去了伙伴
leaving the other member without a partner...

787
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,130
没法湮灭
with which to annihilate.

788
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,510
于是就成为辐射
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation...

789
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,850
被黑洞释放出来
emitted by the black hole.

790
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,980
所以黑洞并不能永远存在
And so black holes are not eternal.

791
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,940
它们以一个不断增加的速率蒸发
They evaporate away at an increasing rate...

792
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,070
直到在一次巨大的爆炸中灰飞烟灭
until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.

793
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,540
量子力学允许粒子和辐射
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation...

794
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,710
从黑洞这种终极监狱中
to escape from the ultimate prison

795
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,210
逃逸出去
a black hole.

796
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,590
爱因斯坦从未接受过量子力学
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics...

797
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,090
正是因为它特有的概率与不确定性
because of its element of chance and uncertainty.

798
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,430
他说 "上帝是不玩骰子的"
He said,"God does not play dice."

799
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:09,480
看来爱因斯坦可能错了
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.

800
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,860
黑洞中的量子效应
The quantum effects of black holes...

801
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,530
表明上帝不仅玩骰子
suggest that not only does God play dice...

802
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,660
他有时还把骰子扔到
he sometimes throws them...

803
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,990
无法观测的地方
where they cannot be seen.

804
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,870
他说他自己
He says himself...

805
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,920
嗯
that,uh...

806
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,590
要是没有生病 就不会取得如今的成就
he wouldn't have got to where he is if he hadn't been ill.

807
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,590
而且我觉得这确实有可能
And I think that's quite possible...

808
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,050
因为就像塞缪尔·约翰逊所说
because it's like Johnson said:

809
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,760
如果你就要上绞刑架
The knowledge you're to be hanged in the morning...

810
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,760
精神便会最集中
concentrates the mind wonderfully.

811
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,180
从某种程度上来说 他专注于科研
And he has concentrated on this in a way...

812
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,350
我觉得他本不会对科学有太大兴趣 因为他对生活中的很多事情
I don't think he would have,because he took a great interest...

813
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,350
都有极大的兴趣
in a lot of things in life...

814
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,520
而且我不知道他会不会同样专注于科研
and I don't know that he'd have applied himself the same way...

815
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:56,900
如果他能够像以前健康的时候一样 所以在一定程度上
if he'd been able to get around as he used to do,so in a way...

816
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,700
是的 即便如此 我也不认为有人能得那样的病是幸运的
No,I can't think anyone's lucky having an illness like that,even so.

817
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,370
但是相对于其他人来说 他的不幸要更少
But it's less bad luck for him than it would be for some people...

818
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,540
因为他能用他的头脑好好地活着
because he can so much live in his head.

819
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,960
当我住到霍金的家里时 我通常
When I lived with the Hawking family,I would usually get up...

820
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,880
七点十五或者七点半起床 洗个澡
around 7:15 or 7:30 and take a shower...

821
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,010
然后读一点圣经并且做祈祷
and then read in my Bible some in the morning and pray...

822
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,930
八点十五的时候下去叫史蒂芬起床
and then go down at 8:15 to get Stephen up.

823
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:25,050
吃早饭的时候我经常告诉他我在圣经上读的东西
And at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the Bible...

824
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,770
希望这些东西最终能有所影响
hoping that this would eventually have some influence.

825
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,440
然后我们就开始工作
So then we would go into work...

826
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,150
通常我们会看看是否有
and usually we'd go in and see if there were any scientific papers...

827
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,280
其他人发表的科研论文
that people sent out.

828
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,780
我确实发现尽管霍金才华横溢 但是他阅读得相当慢
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brilliance,he does read quite slowly.

829
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,700
我阅读速度是他的两倍
I could read about twice as fast as he.

830
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,080
当然他必须要边读边记
But of course he would have to read to remember it...

831
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,040
因为对于他来说回过头来再看是非常困难的
because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing...

832
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,920
而我能相当快速地略读这些论文
whereas I could skim the paper rather quickly and see...

833
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,750
并看看 "这里头没有什么有趣的东西？"
"Is there something interesting in this?"

834
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,090
要是我想研究它 我就能找出来接着看
If I wanted to work on it,I could pick the thing up and look at it.

835
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,470
黑洞辐射
Black hole radiation...

836
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,760
向我们展示了引力坍缩
has shown us that gravitational collapse...

837
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,770
并不像我们曾经想象的那样
is not as final as we once thought.

838
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,980
如果一个宇航员掉进了黑洞
If an astronaut falls into a black hole...

839
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,480
他将会以辐射的形式
he will be returned to the rest of the universe...

840
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,450
回到宇宙中
in the form of radiation.

841
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,450
因此 在某种意义上
Thus,in a sense...

842
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,030
这个宇航员再生了
the astronaut will be recycled.

843
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,370
然而这是一种可怜的永生形式
However,it would be a poor sort of immortality...

844
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,540
因为当他被撕碎的时候
because any personal concept of time...

845
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,010
个体的时间概念就会走到尽头
would come to an end as he is torn apart...

846
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,090
只存在于在黑洞之中
inside the black hole.

847
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,220
世间万物
All that would survive...

848
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,140
都有他的质量或能量
would be his mass,or energy.

849
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,150
有一年 霍金一家人带我一起
One year,the Hawkings took me along...

850
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,110
那时韦·文茨来到
when We Wenz' to a cottage in Wales...

851
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,780
威尔士惠河畔的小屋
near the River Wye...

852
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,320
这个小屋在半山腰上
and this cottage was up a hill...

853
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,740
那有一条
and there was a bit of...

854
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:13,330
通往小屋的铺砌的小道
a paved little sidewalk that went up to the cottage...

855
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,040
当然 我并没有上去
which I had not been up,and of course...

856
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,840
我想尽可能少走几个来回
I wanted to do it in the least number of trips I could imagine...

857
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,130
所以我们把史蒂芬的电池放到椅子下面
so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair...

858
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,340
他的椅子有空间放电池 还能把额外的电池放那下面
his wheelchair has space for batteries ... and put extra batteries under there...

859
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,800
史蒂芬没意识到我把电池放下面了
which Stephen didn't realize that I'd put under there...

860
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,430
所以他没意识到他的轮椅负载那么重
so he didn't realize his wheelchair was as heavily laden.

861
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,640
史蒂芬走到我前头一点 然后准备转弯
Stephen got quite a bit ahead of me,and he was turning the corner...

862
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,850
走向他的屋子 但那是在一个斜坡上
to go around to his house,but that was on a slope...

863
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,770
所以我向上看 注意到史蒂芬的轮椅在慢慢地向后滑
so I looked up,and I noticed Stephen's wheelchair slowly tipping backward.

864
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,700
当然 我大概在十米外
Of course,I was about ten meters away...

865
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,370
我开始冲向他 但是在他跌入灌木丛之前
and tried to run up there,but I was not able to get there...

866
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,040
我没能赶上
rapidly enough before he toppled backward into the bushes.

867
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,960
所以那是一幅有点可怕的景象
So it was a bit of a shocking sight...

868
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,370
看着这个精通万有引力的大师正在克服
to see this master of gravity getting overcome...

869
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,380
地球那微弱的重力
by the weak gravitational force of Earth.

870
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,630
对于我来说 最糟糕的事情之一就是总有人到这里来
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time.

871
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,010
不能一个人安静地待会 我没法忍受
Never alone. I couldn't bear that.

872
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,390
然而他发现这些事很有趣
And yet he finds things funny...

873
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,270
而且他享受这生活 冲向所有地方
and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place...

874
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:18,230
我觉得这是一种巨大的勇气
and I think this is tremendous.

875
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,770
一种我所没有的勇气
But it's a sort of courage I haven't got...

876
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,650
他父亲也没有 我们都没有 我们只能表示敬佩
and his father hadn't got it,and we cannot but admire it...

877
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,990
只能怀疑他究竟如何获得这份勇气 真的
but wonder how on earth he got it,really.

878
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,450
那一定有五十人
There must have been 50 people there...

879
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,330
我站在一个角落
and I was standing off in a corner...

880
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,620
安静地看着
sort of watching quietly...

881
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,750
看了几分钟 正在放松
for a few minutes,relaxing...

882
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,630
史蒂芬就在那 离我不远
and Stephen was over there,not far from me.

883
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,050
简走向史蒂芬看着他
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him.

884
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,670
他正坐在那 头放在大腿上
He was sitting there with his head in his lap...

885
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,430
好像只有史蒂芬能把他的头放在大腿上
like only Stephen can put his head in his lap.

886
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,010
简对史蒂芬说
And Jane said to Stephen...

887
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,260
"你看起来很痛苦 史蒂芬 坐直了"
" You look miserable,Stephen. Sit up straight.

888
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,220
"你的一些客人不理解"
Some of your guests don't understand...

889
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,890
"你正在思考物理 享受着美好的时光"
that you're thinking about physics and having a wonderful time.

890
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,520
"这让你看起来身处痛苦之中 坐直了和你的客人聊聊天"
It looks like you're in pain. Sit up and go talk to your guests."

891
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,780
1979年
In 1979...

892
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,030
我被选为卢卡斯数学教授
I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.

893
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:18,700
这可是牛顿当年做过的职位
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.

894
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,710
他们有一本巨大的书
They he ve a big book which e very university teaching officer...

895
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,920
每一位大学教授都应在上面签字
is supposed to sign.

896
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,050
在我成为卢卡斯教授一年后
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year...

897
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,760
他们意识到我没签过
they realized I had never signed.

898
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,480
所以他们把书带到我办公室
So they brought the book to my office...

899
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,440
我签得非常困难
and I signed with some difficulty.

900
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:47,820
那是我最后一次签我名
That was the last time I signed my name.

901
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,870
我对宇宙起源和命运的兴趣
My interest in the origin and fate of the universe...

902
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,210
在我参加一个梵蒂冈的宇宙学会议的时候
was reawakened when I attended...

903
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,800
被重新唤醒
a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.

904
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,180
在那之后
Aftewards,we were granted...

905
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,220
我们被罗马教皇接见
an audience with the pope.

906
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,930
他告诉我们
He told us that it was all right...

907
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,640
研究大爆炸之后的宇宙演化
to study the evolution of the universe...

908
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,310
这挺好
after the Big Bang...

909
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,020
但是我们不应该研究大爆炸它本身
but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself...

910
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,110
因为那是创造的一瞬间
because that was the moment of creation...

911
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,990
那是上帝的工作
and therefore the work of God.

912
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,200
我很高兴他不知道
I was glad that he did not know...

913
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,790
我刚给出的主题是
the subject of the talk I had just given...

914
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,630
宇宙没有起点的可能性
the possibility that the universe had no beginning...

915
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,050
没有开天辟地的那一瞬间
no moment of creation.

916
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,350
70年代早期有一些理论 第一种类型的创造论
There were theories in the early '70s ... the first type of creation theories...

917
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:04,310
他们从一个固定的外部时空出发
where the people concerned started off with a fixed,external space and time...

918
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,560
这个外部时空永远都是空的
which for eternity was empty...

919
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,730
然后 突然 因为某种未知的原因
and then suddenly,for some unknown reason,the universe nucleates...

920
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,740
宇宙到某个特定的点成核 砰 它爆炸了
at a particular point and then,bang,it blows apart.

921
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,530
但问题是当时间和空间出现在经典理论中
But the trouble is that when space and time appear in the classical theory...

922
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,080
那个点本身是个数学上的奇点
that actual point itself is a singular point in the mathematics.

923
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,160
数学无法处理了 所以…
Mathematics breaks down,and so...

924
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,080
你不能用这个来得出创造论
you cannot use that to give you a creation theory.

925
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,080
如果一个人回到从前
If one goes back in time...

926
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,590
回到大爆炸的奇点
one comes to the Big Bang singularity...

927
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,590
那里的物理法则就不复存在
where the laws of physics break down.

928
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,140
但是有另一个时间线的方向
But there's another direction of time...

929
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,640
可以顺着那个方向来避免奇点
that one can go in which avoids the singularity.

930
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,770
这被称作时间的虚方向
This is called the imaginary direction of time.

931
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,440
在虚时间里
In imaginary time...

932
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,530
不需要
there need not be any singularities...

933
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,490
形成任何时间上有开始或结束的奇点
which form a beginning or end to time.

934
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,000
当你进入虚时间 你就有这种相当特殊的可能性
When you come to imaginary time,you have this rather peculiar possibility...

935
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,290
拥有"现在"
of having a "now," as it were...

936
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,630
它不需要
without necessarily having a sort of a chain...

937
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,970
建立在过去的基础上
of past moments.

938
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,930
如果我从我们所处的瞬间开始 跑向过去的时光
If we start where we are at the moment and start running backwards in time...

939
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,510
那么在很长的一段时间里 事物都会非常正常的运作
then for a long time,things work perfectly normally.

940
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,520
但是当你往前越走越远时
But as you begin to get further and further back towards...

941
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,810
当你愈发远离传统的实时间图像时
what would be the origin point in the conventional real-time picture...

942
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,900
你就能发现时间的性质改变了
you'd find that the nature of time changes...

943
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:35,610
虚的一部分越来越显著
that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent...

944
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,110
直到进入经典理论的奇点
until what ought to have been the singular point in the classical theory...

945
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,570
才变得光滑 然后你就看到这个美丽的碗的画面
gets smoothed away,and you have this beautiful picture...

946
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,490
宇宙诞生的碗
of these bowls where the creation of the universe is pictures...

947
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,500
我们现在在这 光滑的碗是过去
of where we are now,and a smooth bowl of the past...

948
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,750
那里没有奇点 只是光滑的形状
where there's no initial point,just a sort of smooth shape.

949
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,470
只要宇宙有一个起点
So long as the universe had a beginning...

950
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,680
我们就应该有一个创造者
We could suppose it had a creator.

951
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,150
但是如果宇宙是完全独立的
But if the universe is completely self-contained...

952
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,810
无限并且无界
having no boundary or edge...

953
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:18,820
它就不会被创造或者毁灭
it would neither be created nor destroyed.

954
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,700
它很简单地存在着
It would simply be.

955
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:27,540
那么 把创世者摆在什么位置？
What place,then,for a creator?

956
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,380
你所能说的是创世者存在于宇宙之中
All you can really say is that the universe is...

957
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,500
因为它是一个独立的数学结构
because it's a self-consistent mathematical structure.

958
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,670
它没有过去的 因为它不像一个点被创造出来这样的设想
There's no past because,unlike the creation-as-a-point scenario...

959
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,840
对于宇宙来说 没有什么被创造
there's nothing for it to be created in.

960
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:45,350
所以说 创造于虚无之中的说法有点欠妥
So to say it's created from nothing is a bit of a misnomer.

961
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,470
"虚无"这个词的用法会令人误解
It's a misleading use of the word "nothing."

962
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,740
宇宙表现出的并不是空间的虚无
it's not just that there was empty space in which the universe appeared,

963
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,140
你可能把这称之为"虚无"
which you might call "nothing."

964
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,560
宇宙里确实什么都没有 因为连创造都没有
There was really nothing at all,because there wasn't even a creation event.

965
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,490
动词过去式的用法在这些理论里不太合适
The use of a past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.

966
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,910
不幸的是 当人们支持实时间 时态就被创造了
Unfortunately,tenses were set up when people believed in real time,of course...

967
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:06,910
至今我们都没有一种语言形式来描述虚时间的时态
and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.

968
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:11,540
"时间"这个词 可不是作为
The word "time" was not handed down from heaven...

969
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,790
礼物从天堂那流传下来的
as a gift from on high.

970
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,960
时间的概念
The idea of time is a word...

971
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,250
只是个被人类发明的词
invented by man...

972
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,050
如果它让人产生疑惑
and if it has puzzlements connected with it...

973
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,760
这是谁的错？我们的错
whose fault is it? It's our fault.

974
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:29,970
过去与未来
Where does the difference...

975
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,770
有着什么不同？
between the past and the future come from?

976
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,070
科学法则
The laws of science do not distinguish...

977
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,530
没法区分过去与未来
between the past and the future.

978
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,610
但在日常生活中
Yet there is a big difference...

979
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:48,450
过去与未来有着巨大的差别
between the past and future in ordinary life.

980
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,380
你能看到茶杯
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table...

981
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,630
从桌子上跌到地上 摔成碎片
and break into pieces on the floor...

982
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,510
但你从没见过杯子能自己合好
but you will never see the cup gather itself back together...

983
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,010
然后跳回桌子上
and jump back on the table.

984
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,100
混乱或者熵的增加
The increase of disorder,or entropy...

985
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,770
可以区分过去和未来
is what distinguishes the past from the future...

986
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,400
给出时间的方向
giving a direction to time.

987
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,990
他在瑞士生病了
He fell ill in Switzerland.

988
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,290
他回来的时候戴着呼吸机
When he came back,he was on a ventilator.

989
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:35,540
因为他戴着呼吸机 要把管子插到喉咙里
Because he's on a ventilator,you've got a tube down your throat...

990
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,000
所以就不能说话了
and therefore you can't speak,just for that reason.

991
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:41,380
那段时期 可能是两个月
For that period,which may have been a couple of months...

992
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,180
我每两天或每三天会在医院里呆一夜
I spent probably one in two nights,one in three nights,at the hospital...

993
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,720
因为他在医院里
because when he was in hospital...

994
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,010
没法和护士交流
he couldn't communicate with the nurses.

995
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,520
虽然不像是什么大病
It's not just like being seriously ill...

996
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,270
但是护士不能理解史蒂芬的需求
but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.

997
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,360
如果史蒂芬不舒服 他们不知道是为什么
If Stephen was uncomfortable,they couldn't tell why.

998
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,400
在我得肺炎之前
Before I caught pneumonia...

999
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:09,320
我说话越来越含糊不清
my speech had been getting more slurred...

1000
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:12,990
所以很少有人能很清楚地理解我
so that only a few people who knew me Well...

1001
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,040
了解我
could understand me.

1002
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,040
但是至少我能够交流
But at least I could communicate.

1003
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,380
我以向秘书口述的方式
I wrote scientific papers...

1004
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,880
来写论文
by dictating to a secretary...

1005
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,880
并且通过翻译参加研讨会
and I gave seminars through an interpreter.

1006
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:33,010
后来 一个气管改造手术
And then,a tracheostomy operation...

1007
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,390
让我完全失去了说话的能力
removed my ability to speak altogether.

1008
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:43,610
之后的很长一段时间 好吧 看起来是很长时间
After a long time ... well,it seemed like a long time...

1009
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,400
有人想出这个绝妙的小发明
somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.

1010
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,240
剑桥医院里没有这东西
They didn't have it at the Cambridge hospital.

1011
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,410
他们从伦敦的什么地方拿到了
They got it from somewhere in London.

1012
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:55,290
这是个高科技 你不用出声就可以与人交流
This was high technology ... how you can communicate with a person with no voice.

1013
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,160
它是有机玻璃的 大概这么大
It's a plastic piece of Perspex about so big...

1014
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:03,750
你能看到字母像这样排列着 中间有个洞
and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that,and a hole in the middle.

1015
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,420
朝着别人举着它
You hold it up between you and the other person.

1016
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,470
他们看一个字母时 你能知道他们看的是哪个字母
They look at a letter,and you can see which letter they're looking at ...

1017
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,220
绝大多数都行 有时也不能确定
most of the time. Sometimes you can't be sure.

1018
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,600
所以你要有耐心来拼出想要说的话
So you would get the patient to spell out what they wanted.

1019
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,600
每一个字母 你必须看着挑选出A
So each letter ... they have to look to pick out the A.

1020
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,770
你说 "A？" 你明白了吗？就像个猜字游戏
You say,"A?" Did you get it right? It's like a guessing game.

1021
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,380
史蒂芬不愿意接受他不能说话了
Stephen wasn't willing to accept that he wasn't going to speak again...

1022
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,680
他想他会做出让步
and he thought he would be giving in...

1023
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,640
如果找到一种比说话更好的交流方式
by trying to find a method of communicating other than speech.

1024
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:59,810
我记得有个晚上我过去
I remember I went in one evening...

1025
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,640
这是第一次他想
and this was the first time that he asked...

1026
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,360
起床用电脑
to be gotten out of bed to use the computer.

1027
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,110
有时他们会让他坐着 因为他不能总是躺着
Sometimes they'd sit him up so he wasn't lying in bed all the time...

1028
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:12,490
就像你对待一个病人一样 但是这次当我出现的时候
as you do with a patient,but this time when I turned up...

1029
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,450
他问护士 能不能让他起床
he asked the nurse,could he be gotten out of bed...

1030
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,080
那样他可以用电脑 而且他做到了
so he could use the computer,and he did.

1031
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,410
打完招呼之后 我记得他打在电脑上第一句话是
I remember the first thing he typed on there after saying hello...

1032
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,420
史蒂芬总是那么地礼貌
Stephen's always very polite about things like that...

1033
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,340
"你愿意帮助我完成我的书吗？"
was,"Will you help me finish my book?"

1034
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,760
加州的一位电脑专家
A computer expert in California...

1035
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,890
听说了我的近况
heard of my plight...

1036
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,350
发给我一个电脑程序
and sent me a computer program...

1037
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,310
叫做均衡器
called Equalizer.

1038
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,900
它可以让我从屏幕上的一系列的选项中
This allowed me to select words...

1039
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,030
选择单词
from a series of menus on a screen...

1040
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,990
通过按我手中开关
by pressing a switch in my hand.

1041
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:03,290
这些单词再发给一个
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer...

1042
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,790
装在轮椅上的语音合成器
attached to my wheelchair.

1043
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,090
令我惊喜的是
Much to my surprise...

1044
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,880
我发现我能够
I found I was able to communicate...

1045
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,050
比以前更好地进行交流了
much better than before.

1046
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,600
当最后他从医院回到家
When eventually he went home from hospital...

1047
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,640
他被告知他需要二十四小时监护 每一个人都说
he was told he needed 24-hour nursing,and everyone was saying...

1048
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:27,350
"他要怎么继续工作？"
"How is he going to go in and do work?

1049
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,900
"工作时也要有护士陪着吗？"
Is he going to trail around with nurses after him in the office?"

1050
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,070
当然是那样
And of course he did.

1051
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:36,700
他们最初讨论让他在家工作
They talked originally of him working at home...

1052
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,070
他对此并不满意
which he wasn't happy with.

1053
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,160
所以 在家恢复了一段时间之后
And so,after a period of recuperation at home...

1054
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,750
他就决定回到他的办公室
he just decided to go back into the office.

1055
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,130
而他从家到办公室的途中
And he'd make the trip from his house to the office...

1056
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:53,050
我不太清楚 用轮椅走了半英里
which is,I don't know,half a mile in his wheelchair...

1057
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,920
有一个护士跟着他
with a nurse walking along with him.

1058
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:57,840
那时他依然到处转转
This is at the time when he was still driving around...

1059
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,890
带着一个袋子和鼻滴
with the bag and the nasal drip...

1060
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:03,930
工作 回家
going into the department,working,going back home.

1061
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,270
我开始想象
I began to wonder what would happen...

1062
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,190
当宇宙停止膨胀
when the universe stopped expanding...

1063
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,690
开始收缩之后 会发生什么
and began to contract.

1064
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,450
我们会看到破碎的杯子
Would we see broken cups...

1065
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,240
自己合好
gather themselves together off the floor...

1066
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:25,000
从地上跳回桌上？
and jump back onto the table?

1067
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:30,790
我们会记得明天的物价
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices...

1068
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,050
在股票市场大赚一笔？
and make a fortune off the stock market?

1069
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,260
对于我来说
It seemed to me...

1070
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:41,550
宇宙一定会回到一个平滑有序的状态
the universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state...

1071
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,640
当它再次坍缩的时候
when it recollapsed.

1072
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,730
时间就开始倒退
If this were so,time would go backwards...

1073
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,650
当宇宙开始坍缩的时候
when the universe began to collapse.

1074
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:59,150
在收缩阶段人们会倒着活
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backward.

1075
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,820
他们会死在出生之前
They would die before they were born...

1076
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:05,540
当宇宙缩小 能再获青春
and get younger as the universe got small again.

1077
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:10,170
最终回到子宫
Eventually,they would return to the womb.

1078
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,920
头一次 他给我留了一个问题
He gave me my first problem to do.

1079
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,260
他让我看看这个数学问题
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem.

1080
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:23,260
通常当他给出一个问题 他的脑海里
Usually when he gives a problem,he has a good idea...

1081
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,430
会有答案的大概样子
of what the answer should be.

1082
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,100
我看了一下 花了我几个月
I went to look at it,and it took me a few months...

1083
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,270
来理解这是什么东西 然后回来说 "我知道答案了"
to understand what it was about,and I came back and said,"I get this answer."

1084
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,860
他对我说 "不 这不是我所期望的"
And he said to me,"No,that is not what I expected."

1085
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:41,070
我说 "这就是我得到的" 所以我走向黑板 解释它是什么
I said,"That's what I get." So I went to the blackboard,explained what it was.

1086
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,990
他说 "考虑特殊情况了吗？" 我说 "没考虑"
He said,"Did you think about that particular case?" I said,"No,I didn't."

1087
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,160
所以我又回去了
So I went back...

1088
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,000
然后计算他告诉我的东西
and I calculated what he'd talked to me about.

1089
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,250
在我回去的一个星期后 我说 "史蒂芬 我得不到这些东西"
I came back a few weeks after,and I said,"Stephen,I don't get this thing.

1090
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,500
"我仍然得出了一开始的答案"
I still get the same answer I had originally."

1091
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,300
所以他对我说 "不不不"
So he said to me,"No,no,no,no.

1092
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,430
"这没用 你想过那些东西吗？"
This doesn't work. Did you think about that?"

1093
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:05,220
我说 "哦 不 我忘了考虑特殊情况"
I said,"Oh,no. I'd forgotten about that particular case."

1094
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,680
所以我回去重新开始计算
So I went back to the drawing board and started calculating again...

1095
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,810
再一次 我得到了相同的答案
and again I got the same answer.

1096
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:14,980
所以我又回来见史蒂芬 这拖延了两三个月
So I went back to see Stephen,and this dragged on for two or three months.

1097
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,860
最后他对我说
Finally he said to me...

1098
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,240
"可能你的某一个近似是无效的"
"Maybe one of your approximations is not valid."

1099
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:26,580
所以我和我的同事决定用计算机做这件事
So me and a colleague decided to do the thing with computers.

1100
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,830
这花了大把时间来写程序
This takes a lot of time to Write the programs...

1101
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,710
还要确定程序是正确的
and to be sure the program was correct.

1102
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:35,420
我们得到答案 仍然和我之前说的一样
We get the answer,and it was still the way I'd said before...

1103
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,750
而不是史蒂芬说的那种 所以我们去见史蒂芬 说 "看到了吗？还是这样"
and not the way Stephen said,so we went to see Stephen and said,"See? Again."

1104
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,800
我犯了一个错误
I had made a mistake.

1105
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:52,100
我使用的宇宙模型太过简单
I had been using too simple a model of the universe.

1106
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,400
当宇宙开始收缩时
Time will not reverse direction...

1107
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,440
时间不会反转
when the universe begins to contract.

1108
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,820
人们还会继续变老
People will continue to get older...

1109
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:10,120
所以等着宇宙再次坍缩 回到我们的青春
so it is no good waiting until the universe recollapses...

1110
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,290
这不现实
to return to our youth.

1111
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:31,220
爱因斯坦曾经问了一个问题
Einstein once asked the question...

1112
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,640
"在构建宇宙的时候"
"How much choice did God have...

1113
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,270
"上帝有多少种选择？"
in constructing the universe?"

1114
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,240
如果我的宇宙没有边界的假设是对的
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct...

1115
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,490
那么上帝在创世上
he had no freedom at all...

1116
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:48,200
毫无选择的余地
to choose how the universe began.

1117
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,580
他唯一可以选择的是
He would only have had the freedom...

1118
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,660
宇宙所服从的法则
to choose the laws the universe obeyed.

1119
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,880
然而 这可能
This,however,may not have been...

1120
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,250
也没有太多选择
all that much of a choice.

1121
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:07,630
可能只有一种统一理论
There may well be only one unified theory...

1122
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,470
这种理论允许各种复杂结构的存在
that allows for the existence of structures...

1123
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,350
像人类一样复杂
As complicated as human beings...

1124
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,100
人类能研究宇宙法则
who can investigate the laws of the universe...

1125
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,810
能够探究上帝的本质
and ask about the nature of God.

1126
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,990
我不知道这些实验有多明确
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are...

1127
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,290
但是有过关于意识时间的实验
but there are experiments that have been done on the timing of consciousness...

1128
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:38,370
它们似乎都会得到一幅非常奇怪的图景
and they seem to lead to a very odd picture...

1129
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,330
而这图像也没有什么确切的意义
which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.

1130
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,550
我不确定这些实验的精细
Whether refinement of these experiments...

1131
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:46,550
是否能摆脱这种异常
might get rid of this kind of anomaly I'm not sure...

1132
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:50,550
但是它看起来有点像与意识有关的奇怪的东西
but it does look a little as though there is something very odd about consciousness...

1133
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,310
还像是未来在某种程度上影响了过去
and somehow almost as though the future affects the past in some way...

1134
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,930
这种影响只在非常小且有限的尺度上
over a very tiny,limited scale,but something maybe of the order...

1135
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,020
或者是什么只在一秒内有序的东西
of a reasonable fraction of a second.

1136
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,400
没理由相信
And there's no reason to believe...

1137
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,280
一个人的意识体验
that one's conscious experience...

1138
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,320
在另一些阶段不会成为
shouldn't be part of somebody else's...

1139
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,240
别人意识的一部分
at some other stage.

1140
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,700
我不知道这是否可信 说一个人死后
I don't know if it's fair to say what happens after one dies...

1141
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,990
他可能会成为另一个人
but it's a plausible picture...

1142
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,910
但这貌似是很有可能的
that you could be somebody else...

1143
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:22,040
并且某人可能是活在过去的某个人 而不是未来的
and that somebody else could be somebody that lived in the past,not in the future.

1144
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,510
即使只有一种可能的大统一理论
Even if there is only one possible unified theory...

1145
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:32,890
即一套准则和方程
that is just a set of rules and equations...

1146
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:37,850
那是什么扰乱了这些等式
what is it that breathes fire into the equations...

1147
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:41,480
制造出一个它们所描绘的宇宙呢？
and makes a universe for them to describe ?

1148
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,730
为什么宇宙要自寻烦恼？
Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?

1149
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,610
是否是大统一理论如此势不可挡
Is the unified theory so compelling...

1150
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,780
以至于引起其自身存在的问题？
that it brings about its own existence?

1151
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,370
或许 他需要一个创造者？
Or does it need a creator?

1152
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,540
如果是这样
And,if so...

1153
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,630
是谁创造了创造者？
who created him?

1154
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,010
我想我会说宇宙有个目的
I think I would say that the universe has a purpose.

1155
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,310
它不是偶然地莫名其妙地存在
It's not somehow just there by chance.

1156
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:23,100
我想它是
I think it's ... Yeah.

1157
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,690
那么的
So...

1158
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:28,270
它是
it's... it's...

1159
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,650
我想有些人会持这么一种观点 宇宙就在那
Some people,I think,take the view that the universe is just there...

1160
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,280
它只是不停地运行
and it sort of runs and runs,and it just sort of computes...

1161
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,620
我们偶然发现了我们身处其中
and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing.

1162
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,790
但我觉得这不是一种
But I don't think that's a very fruitful...

1163
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:45,330
正确的看待宇宙的方式
or helpful way of looking at the universe.

1164
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,340
我认为宇宙有更深层次的东西
I think that there is something much deeper about it.

1165
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:54,550
在实时间中 就是我们所生活的这种时间
In real time,the time in which we live...

1166
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,640
宇宙有两种可能的命运
the universe has two possible destinies:

1167
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,430
它可能永远继续扩张
It may continue to expand forever...

1168
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,400
或者 它可能在大收缩中
or it may recollapse and come to an end...

1169
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,480
再次坍缩 最终结束
at the Big Crunch.

1170
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,240
这与大爆炸相当类似
It would be rather like the Big Bang...

1171
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,360
但过程相反
but in reverse.

1172
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,200
现在我相信宇宙最终会在
I now believe that the universe will come to an end...

1173
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,500
大收缩中结束
at the Big Crunch.

1174
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,710
然而 我确实
I do,however,have certain advantages...

1175
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,380
比其他厄运先知更占优势
over many other prophets of doom.

1176
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,220
无论一百亿年之后会发生什么
Whatever happens ten billion years from now...

1177
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:41,100
我都不希望被证明是错误的
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.

1178
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:48,270
我所知道的所有画面
Of all the pictures that I know...

1179
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,230
任何最简单的宇宙学的结论
the simplest of any cosmology...

1180
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,570
就是宇宙是封闭的
is that in which the universe is closed...

1181
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,860
拥有有限的寿命
has a finite lifetime...

1182
01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:00,240
会坍缩
and collapses with the same kind of collapse...

1183
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,240
像黑洞坍缩那样
that a black hole does.

1184
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,870
如果结果确实是那样
If it should turn out that indeed...

1185
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,080
宇宙的生命是有限的
the universe is limited in its life...

1186
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,420
那么它的生命
how is that different from the life...

1187
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,430
与我们每个人的又有什么不同？
of each one of us?

1188
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:29,770
在3月5日 星期二的晚上
On the evening of Tuesday,March 5fh...

1189
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,360
大概10:45
at about 10:45. . .

1190
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,440
我正准备回去皮恩斯的公寓
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.

1191
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,860
天色很暗 又下着雨
It was dark and raining.

1192
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,790
我来到格兰芝路
I came up to Grange Road...

1193
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:46,250
看见车灯正在接近
and saw headlights approaching...

1194
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:49,120
但是我判断他们离我足够远
but judged that they were far enough away...

1195
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,330
使我能安全地通过
that I could cross safely.

1196
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:57,670
那辆车一定是开得非常快
The vehicle must have been traveling very fast...

1197
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,390
因为当我仅仅到路中间时
for when I got just past the middle of the road...

1198
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:04,260
我的护士就惊呼 "小心 "
my nurse screamed,"Look out!"

1199
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,980
我听到轮胎在滑行
I heard tires skidding...

1200
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,900
一阵强风从我轮椅后面吹来
and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.

1201
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,860
我最后躺在路上
I ended up in the road...

1202
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:20,360
腿搭着剩下的轮椅
with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.

1203
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,120
这场事故弄坏了我的轮椅
The accident destroyed my wheelchair...

1204
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,660
还毁了
and damaged my computer system...

1205
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:29,710
我用来交流的计算机
with which I communicate.

1206
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:35,840
我要在头上缝十三针
I required 13 stitches in my head...

1207
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:42,010
但是几天之后我就能够回去工作了
but I was able to go back to work several days later.

1208
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,850
我对那一段的记忆
The memories I have are very much...

1209
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,900
大概是
kind of...

1210
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,980
史蒂芬当时的样子
visual pictures of what Stephen was...

1211
01:16:56,110 --> 01:17:00,280
以及他在那种情形下的情况
of seeing Stephen in certain situations.

1212
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,410
他总是在动
He was always moving.

1213
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,200
总是
Always.

1214
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:07,290
呃 几乎没安静过
Well,hardly ever still.

1215
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:12,710
关于他的表情和姿态也一样
It was the same thing about his face and gesture...

1216
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,130
他曾常用的那些 我应该说
which he used a great deal,I should say...

1217
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,000
但这仅仅是记忆了
but it's only memory.

1218
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,010
最近我找到一些照片
I found some photographs recently...

1219
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:25,720
使我想起每一个人的样子
which reminded me of the general look of everybody...

1220
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,810
我必须说史蒂芬非常像他现在的样子
and I must say Stephen looked very much like he does now...

1221
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,020
如果你能想起以前的他
if one thinks of him like that.

1222
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,660
他非常强烈地相信
He does believe very intensely...

1223
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:49,330
人类的思想有无限可能
in the almost infinite possibility of the human mind.

1224
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,950
在你知道你不能之前
You have to find out what you can't know...

1225
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,080
你一定能发现那些你没法知道的事情 不是吗？
before you know you can't,don't you?

1226
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:58,590
所以我认为思想一点都不应该被束缚
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all.

1227
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:02,920
为什么你不该继续想那些无法想象的东西？
Why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?

1228
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,090
或许有些人已经开始了
Somebody's got to start sometime.

1229
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,680
想想在一个世纪以前有多少事情是无法想象的
Think how many things were unthinkable a century ago...

1230
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,850
还有人们曾想过的
and yet people have thought them.

1231
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,180
它们经常看起来不切实际
And often they also seemed quite unpractical.

1232
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,360
史蒂芬说的东西
Not all the things Stephen says probably...

1233
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,650
并不一定都被当作真理
are to be taken as gospel truth.

1234
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:22,240
他是一个探索者 他正在探索
He's a searcher. He's looking for things.

1235
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,110
有时他可能是胡说八道 好吧 难道我们不也是吗？
And sometimes he probably talks nonsense. Well,don't we all?

1236
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,490
但关键是
But the point is...

1237
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,910
人类必须思考
people must think.

1238
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,910
必须继续思考
People must go on thinking.

1239
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,460
他们必须试着扩展知识的边界
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge...

1240
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,090
有时他们甚至不知道从何开始
and they don't sometimes even know where to start.

1241
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,090
你不知道边界在哪 不是吗？
You don't know where the boundaries are,do you?

1242
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,470
你不知道你的起点是什么
You don't know what your taking-off point is.

1243
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,320
如果我们确实发现了一个完整的宇宙理论
If we do discover a complete theory of the universe...

1244
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,650
它应该及时就成为广泛的原则
it should in time be understandable...

1245
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:06,570
被每个人所理解
in broad principle by everyone...

1246
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,240
而不仅仅是少数的科学家
not just a few scientists.

1247
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,960
然后我们所有人
Then we shall all...

1248
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,500
无论哲学家 科学家 还是普通人
philosophers,scientists,and just ordinary people...

1249
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:24,840
都能够参与讨论
be able to take part in the discussion of why it is...

1250
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,510
我们和这宇宙为什么存在
that we and the universe exist.

1251
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:34,850
如果我们找到答案
If we find the answer to that...

1252
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,230
这将是人类理性的
it would be the ultimate triumph...

1253
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:39,310
最终胜利
of human reason...

1254
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,030
因为我们知道了
for then we would know...

1255
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:47,530
上帝的想法
the mind of God.
