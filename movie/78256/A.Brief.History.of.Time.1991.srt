I don't think I put it in quite those words...

138
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,480

but I made some such remark to him...

139
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,400

and he disagreed.

140
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,160

And so we made a bet on the subject.

In our childish way,we bet...

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,960

The expansion of the universe...

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,760

suggested the possibility...

a lot of other people didn't do much better."

158
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,800

He was quite unconcerned.

159
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,970

Somehow he was always recognized...

161

Everybody used to argue theology.

That's a good,safe subject.

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,760

You don't need any facts or...

171

you know,debating you can quite happily debate about anything...

and the argument breaks up.

179
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,250
���ǿ����������ϵ��ڹ�ȥ��ĳ��ʱ��
one can imagine that God created the universe...

if the universe is expanding...

183

there may be physical reasons...

why there had to be a beginning.

185
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,230

An expanding universe does not preclude a creator...

186
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,230
���������ϵ��Ǻ�ʱ�����ⷽ��

it was arranged that Stephen should come and live with us for a year.

He decided it would be nice...

193
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,970

but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall...

194
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,760

and so we bought some records...

196
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,770

and Stephen took charge.

197
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,820

And he insisted you put on a jacket and a tie.

198
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,450

And then he was the master of the proceedings.

199
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,780

And Stephen took it very seriously.

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,720

219
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,650

But the question always with Stephen was...

"����Ӧ����������һ���İ˸�����֮һ"
"Should we make him the cox of the first eight...

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,660

He was rather an adventurous type.

Because of my lack of work...

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,840

I didn't do very well.

272
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,970

I was on the borderline between a first- and second-class degree...

273
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,520
�Ҳ��ò�ͨ���������������ܹ���õڼ���

274
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,310

They asked me about my future plans.

If I only got a second...

I would stay in Oxford.

They gave me a first.

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,630

I drove Stephen and his young brother...

He was testing himself out,I think. I didn't realize.

284
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,060

He did manage to climb a tree...

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,810

I think he began to notice that his hands...

287
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,570

were less useful than they had been...

It was just coming down from one of the rooms.

292
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,380

Steve actually fell on the stairs coming downstairs...

and kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.

294
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,220
�Ҳ�֪�����Ƿ�ʧȥ����ʶ ����ʧ����
I don't know if he lost consciousness,but he lost his memory.

295
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,010
���ǰ���Ū��һ���ط� �����ҷ���Ҳ���Ǳ��˵ķ���
We took him to either my room or someone's room.

296
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,600
����һ��������� "����˭��"
The first question of course was,"Who am I?"

297
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,140
���Ǹ����� "����ʷ�ٷҡ�����"
We told him,"You're Steve Hawking."

298
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,730
������������������һ�� "����˭��"
Right away he would ask again,"Who am I?"

299
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,610

"Steve Hawking."

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,530

Then,after a couple of minutes,he remembered he was Steve Hawking.

301
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,870
Ȼ���������� "�㻹�ǵ�����������"
Then we'd say,"Do you remember going down to the bar...

302
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,330
"��ȥ�ưɺȾ�ô��"
and having a drink on Sunday night?"

303
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,910

Or,"Do you remember coxing on the river on Monday?"

304
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,420

And his memory came back gradually...

305
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,130

until he could remember the previous day's events,and then the previous hour...

306
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,170
����������Сʱ���ܼ���ÿһ����
and by the end of the two hours,he could remember everything.

307
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,590

The question was,"Well,maybe you've lost...

And so Steve decided,"Well,I'll take the Mensa test."

310
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,060
���ǻ�Ӧ�� "��һ�������"
We said,"Of course you'll get in."

311
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,770

But he came back delighted he was able to get into Mensa.

312
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,860

Absolutely delighted.

313
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,950
�Ҹо���������
I felt that there were two areas...

314
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,250

of theoretical physics...

315
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,540
���ڽ��ſ��ܻ��о�����������
I might study at Cambridge.

316
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,130

One was cosmology,the study of the very large.

317
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,680

The other was elementary particles...

the study of the very small.

319
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,850

However,I thought elementary particles...

320
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,650

were less attractive...

321
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,820

because there was no proper theory.

322
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,860

All they could do...

323
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,070

was arrange the particles in families...

In cosmology,on the other hand...

326
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,580
�ж�����ȷ������
there was a well-defined theory

327
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,050

Einstein's general theory of relativity.

328
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,260

It was a very cold year...

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,690

and the ice on Verulamium Pond...

330
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,270

it was frozen there...

331
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,690

and we all went skating.

332
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,360

And Stephen managed to skate fairly well...

but then,he and I were close together.

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,160

He wasn't skating in a very advanced way...

but nor was I,if it comes to that.

336
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,000

He fell...

337
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,290

338
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,090

So I took him to a caf�� to warm up...

339
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,710

and he told me then all about it.

00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,510

And it was diagnosed.

341
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,930
�Ҽ��Ҫ������ҽ��
I insisted on going to see his doctor...

342
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,310

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,770
�Ҷ���֪����û��ʲô������ʲô���ܹ�������
there's probably something someone can do about it

at least anyhow to make things easier for people.

stuck electrodes into me...

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,060

The doctors could offer no cure...

and gave me 21/2 years to live.

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,910

I went into the graduates' common room...

looking,really,for someone to have lunch with.

only his heart and his lungs...

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,270

eventually he would essentially have the body of a cabbage...

I had got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.

I wanted to understand...

Roger Penrose made his discovery...

452
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,290

667
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640

My discoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest...

00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,930
�¼��ӽ�����
that the area of the event horizon...

669

actually was the entropy of a black hole.

But there was one fatal flaw. ..

00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,150

In Bekenstein's idea:

672
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,990

If black holes have an entropy...

they ought to have a temperature.

And if they have a temperature...

675
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,790

they ought to give off radiation.

But how could they give off radiation...

if nothing can escape from a black hole ?

As it turned out...

679
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,180

As he gradually lost the use of his hands...

683
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,030

So then we would go into work...

Black hole radiation...

the subject of the talk I had just given...

914
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,630

the possibility that the universe had no beginning...

no moment of creation.

916
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,350
70���������һЩ���� ��һ�����͵Ĵ�����
There were theories in the early '70s ... the first type of creation theories...

917
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:04,310
���Ǵ�һ���̶����ⲿʱ�ճ���
where the people concerned started off with a fixed,external space and time...

00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,560

and then suddenly,for some unknown reason,the universe nucleates...

00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,740

at a particular point and then,bang,it blows apart.

921
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,530
�������ǵ�ʱ��Ϳռ�����ھ���������
But the trouble is that when space and time appear in the classical theory...

922
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,080
�Ǹ��㱾���Ǹ���ѧ�ϵ����
that actual point itself is a singular point in the mathematics.

923
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,160
��ѧ�޷������� ���ԡ�
Mathematics breaks down,and so...

924
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,080

you cannot use that to give you a creation theory.

925
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,080

If one goes back in time...

926
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,590

one comes to the Big Bang singularity...

where the laws of physics break down.

But there's another direction of time...

929
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,640

that one can go in which avoids the singularity.

930
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,770
�ⱻ����ʱ����鷽��
This is called the imaginary direction of time.

931
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,440

In imaginary time...

932
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,530

there need not be any singularities...

933

which form a beginning or end to time.

934
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,000
���������ʱ�� ����������൱����Ŀ�����
When you come to imaginary time,you have this rather peculiar possibility...

935
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,290

of having a "now," as it were...

00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,930

If we start where we are at the moment and start running backwards in time...

you'd find that the nature of time changes...

that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent...

944
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,110

until what ought to have been the singular point in the classical theory...

949
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:02,470

So long as the universe had a beginning...

950
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,680
���Ǿ�Ӧ����һ��������
We could suppose it had a creator.

951
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,150
���������������ȫ������
But if the universe is completely self-contained...

952
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,810
���޲����޽�
having no boundary or edge...

953
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:18,820
���Ͳ��ᱻ������߻���
it would neither be created nor destroyed.

954
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,700

It would simply be.

What place,then,for a creator?

956
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,380
������˵���Ǵ����ߴ���������֮��
All you can really say is that the universe is...

957
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,500

958
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,670

����������˵ û��ʲô������
there's nothing for it to be created in.

960
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:45,350
����˵ ����������֮�е�˵���е�Ƿ��
So to say it's created from nothing is a bit of a misnomer.

961
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,470
"����"����ʵ��÷����������
It's a misleading use of the word "nothing."

962
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,740
������ֳ��Ĳ����ǿռ������
it's not just that there was empty space in which the universe appeared,

01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,140

which you might call "nothing."

01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,560

There was really nothing at all,because there wasn't even a creation event.

01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,490
���ʹ�ȥʽ���÷�����Щ�����ﲻ̫����
The use of a past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
