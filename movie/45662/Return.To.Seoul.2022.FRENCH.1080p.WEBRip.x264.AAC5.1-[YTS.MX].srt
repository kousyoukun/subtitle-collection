3
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,281
Welcome.

4
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,952
Sorry, I didn't see you. May I help you?

5
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,749
Did you make a reservation?

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,960
What are you listening?

7
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,839
Uh, it's Korean music.

8
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:30,841
Can I?

9
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,136
Yeah, of course.

10
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,788
How long do you want to stay?

11
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:11,089
Mm... I don't know yet.
But, uh, three nights? It's okay?

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,926
It's as you wish, of course.

13
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,511
I need your passport, please.

14
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:18,972
Thanks.

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,895
But you're French!

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,861
RETURN TO SEOUL

17
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,701
-  Cheers!
-  Cheers!

18
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,418
Ah!

19
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,878
Is it good?

20
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,636
So, Freddie,
do you really know nothing about Korea?

21
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,595
Nothing.

22
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,183
- What are you going to do?
- Uh, I don't have any plans.

23
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,146
Nonetheless, Freddie, what would
you like to see during your stay?

24
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,983
Everything. Is that possible?

25
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,152
- Not in two weeks.
- No?

26
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,863
Totally impossible.

27
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,616
- It's funny hearing you speak French.

28
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,870
-  Oh.
- Ah! No, you mustn't.

29
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,832
- Really?
- Let others refill your glass.

30
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,542
Why?

31
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,919
It's insulting otherwise.

32
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:35,007
It would mean
your friends aren't treating you right.

33
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,925
Insulting? For whom?

34
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,137
Mm... for both.

35
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,197
Is this your mother?

36
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,866
My biological mother, yes, I think so.

37
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,371
It's all I have of Korea.

38
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,836
A few years ago,
there was a TV programme... What was it?

39
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,921
<i>The Morning Court?</i>

40
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,923
Not that, the other, older one.

41
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,135
<i>- I Want to See This Person?</i>
- Yes, that.

42
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:24,681
Uh, it was a popular programme
where adoptees met up

43
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,559
- with their parents.
- Actually, it's...

44
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,686
What is it called in French?

45
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
A play on words.

46
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,525
In Korean, it means both

47
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,861
"I want to see this person"
and "I miss this person."

48
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,199
Your story brings to mind
an old Mongolian poem...

49
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,411
entitled <i>Land of my Birth.</i>

50
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,496
Oh, yeah?

51
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,792
Dongwan did comparative studies
of French and Asian literature.

52
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,835
Mm...

53
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,381
I can't say it correctly in French,

54
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,091
but it goes something like this:

55
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,471
<i>Land where, in summer</i>

56
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,766
<i>The earth is like</i>

57
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,143
<i>A carpet of flowers</i>

58
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,899
<i>The song of the birds, of the land</i>

59
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,985
<i>As far as the south</i>

60
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,365
<i>This, all of this</i>

61
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,702
<i>Is the land of my birth</i>

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,956
Wow!

63
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,583
-  Cheers!
-  Cheers!

64
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,675
Oh.

65
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,430
Tell me, Freddie, mm...

66
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,973
do you know Hammond?

67
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,892
Who is Ammonde?

68
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,728
No, Hammond.

69
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,313
It's the adoption centre.

70
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,690
It's a very famous place in Korea.

71
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,484
Okay, and...?

72
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,406
Well, you could go there.

73
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,411
Are you going to
try and find your parents?

74
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,705
No.

75
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,666
Uh... why not?

76
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,841
Do you know what sight-reading is?

77
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,516
It's when you play a score
for the first time.

78
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,311
You have to be able
to analyse the music in one glance,

79
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,939
evaluate the danger and jump in.

80
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,275
Are you a musician?

81
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,027
I was, but that's not the point.

82
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,906
There are signs all over
that you don't see.

83
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,366
But you can learn to read them

84
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,076
and catch them when they appear.

85
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,121
- What signs?
- Fear, for example.

86
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,585
Want to see?

87
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,016
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

88
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,103
Cheers!

89
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,021
Take a seat!

90
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,566
-  Can I?
-  Sit, sit!

91
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:30,576
Soju first! Then cheers! Come on!

92
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,788
-  Where are you from?
-  Wait.

93
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:36,665
Come on.

94
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,500
Come on!

95
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,336
Come on!

96
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,052
They are my friends, Tena and Dongwan.

97
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,387
Is that right?

98
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,514
Dongwan. They're Koreans!

99
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,850
So they speak Korean!

100
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,442
You want to join us?

101
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,195
-  Is she your friend?
-  Uh, yes.

102
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,114
And... has she had a lot to drink?

103
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,032
She's had a few.

104
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,909
What is she doing?

105
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,952
She's bringing them over.

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,248
-  Hello!
- Hello!

107
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,667
Can you put chairs? Put the chairs too.

108
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,714
And you, you can sit here. Yeah.

109
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,343
-  Come.
-  Are you sure?

110
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,053
Yes, I'm sure.

111
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,932
-  Hello!
-  Nice to meet you.

112
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,313
Wait, move.

113
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,024
- Do you know her well?
- No, not at all.

114
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,446
- Hello!
- Hello!

115
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,619
Like the guy with the fringe?
Not bad, huh?

116
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,372
- No?
- No.

117
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,627
One bottle of soju, please.
No, no, no, two, two, two!

118
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,380
Two bottles of soju
and a plate of chicken feet!

119
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,674
Your friend is very original.

120
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,634
In what way?

121
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,219
My name Jiwan.

122
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,429
Where are you from?

123
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,474
France.

124
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,310
France?

125
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,855
France!

126
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,147
France?

127
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,609
- France!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,278
France!

129
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,487
Paris Baguette!

130
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,370
It's a famous chain of Korean bakeries.

131
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,038
She doesn't look French...

132
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,332
Who cares? Let's toast. Cheers!

133
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:49,715
Oh.

134
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,852
She has a typically Korean face,
doesn't she?

135
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,732
She says
your face is like a long-time Korean.

136
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:11,320
-  Long-time?
-  From ancient, ancestral Korea.

137
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,908
She's right. You have pure Korean traits.

138
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,367
I do?

139
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,620
Thank you.

140
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,624
I wish I could speak another language.

141
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,543
Him also, original Korean!

142
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,096
Shall we play a game?

143
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,807
-  Yeah, let's!
-  A game! Any ideas?

144
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,268
Let's start with the song.

145
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,604
Look at me.

146
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,897
You see her.

147
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,316
-  Yeah.
- We explain.

148
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,234
Okay.

149
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:56,031
<i>♪ A rabbit comes

00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,340
Let's show her!

What's wrong?

163
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,372
Did we sleep together?

164
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,666
What?

165
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,045
You and me, sex?

166
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,756
Sex?

167
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,382
Jeez, I can't remember.

168
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,761
Do it again, is that okay for you?

169
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,142
Sex, again, you and me, okay?

170
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,894
Okay.

171
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:51,980
Come.

172
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,658
Watch where you're going!

173
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,728
Um... do you have your adoption file?

174
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,396
No.

175
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,024
You don't have it.

176
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,485
No, it's at my parents' place, in France.

177
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:24,364
I see. Do you have your file number?

178
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:26,992
No.

179
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,038
Your birth name?

180
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,754
Then Hammond cannot help you.

181
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,758
You should have contacted us
before coming.

182
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:48,096
I, um... came to Korea
sort of by surprise.

183
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,225
What surprise?

184
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,106
Could you come back another day

185
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,817
with the copy of your adoption file?

186
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,988
How long will you be staying in Korea?

187
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:06,865
Two weeks.

188
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,869
Two weeks. Hm...

189
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:12,871
Uh...

190
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:18,794
I do have this photo,
which was in my file.

191
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,841
There's a number on the back.

192
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,228
Mm. Wait here.

193
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,519
EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION,
1958-2004

194
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,030
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

195
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,535
I have your adoption file here,

196
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,204
recorded in our system.

197
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,957
This is a copy.

198
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,173
Your birth name is Yeon-hee.

199
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,718
I thought it was pronounced Yon-Ay.

200
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,971
- Uh...
- Does it mean anything?

201
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:38,016
Mm. Docile and joyful.

202
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,313
You stayed a few months
at the Hammond in Jeonju

203
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,524
before leaving for France.

204
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:49,319
Your father dropped you off here.

205
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:54,408
He also left his social security number

206
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,619
and your biological mother's,

207
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,039
in case you wanted to find them someday.

208
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:02,666
He did?

209
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,712
I have transferred this info
to our services, uh,

210
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:11,550
and they have found addresses
for both your biological parents.

211
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,264
Your mother lives in Jeonju

212
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,933
and your father in Gunsan.

213
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,727
Why did you do that?

214
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,188
Uh...

215
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,606
Mm...

216
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,694
Uh, very often, adoptees who contact us

217
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:35,407
want to find their biological parents.

218
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,202
How does that work?

219
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:41,955
I cannot give you their addresses,

220
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,709
but we can send them a telegram.

221
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,171
It's a standard message inviting them

222
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,591
to get in touch with our services.

223
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,720
Mm... if they do, we inform them

224
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,516
that their child
is trying to contact them.

225
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,062
<i>What if they refuse?</i>

226
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:11,527
<i>Then the case
is definitively closed for us.</i>

227
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:16,240
<i>We are forbidden by law
to contact them again.</i>

228
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,621
<i>Do you wish to send a telegram</i>

229
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,581
<i>to your biological parents?</i>

230
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,734
Hammond is on the phone.

231
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,866
Hello, it's Frédérique Benoît.

232
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,953
Yes, hello.

233
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,628
Ah.

234
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,254
Really?

235
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,592
Uh, yes, wait.

236
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,473
Zero, one, zero...

237
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,936
seven, four, six, four...

238
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,898
zero, six, five, one.

239
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,275
Yes, I've got it.

240
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,448
No, it's okay, I can see him alone.

241
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,035
Yes, okay.

242
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,330
Wait. What about, uh, my mother?

243
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,506
I leave in ten days.

244
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:43,679
Okay, thanks.

245
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:51,895
Well?

246
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,942
Do you want me to call him?

247
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,141
Hello?

248
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,688
Hello, sir, I'm a friend of your daughter.

249
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,195
No, this isn't Hammond.
I'm a friend of your daughter.

250
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:46,909
Wait.

251
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:51,371
He suggests you go to Gunsan this weekend.

252
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,791
Because he works during the week,
he can't come to Seoul.

253
00:22:58,921 --> 00:22:59,963
Wait.

254
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,299
Well?

255
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:05,511
Okay.

256
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,556
Yes, that works for her.

257
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,075
Driver?

258
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,245
Driver!

259
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,749
Driver! [in Korean] Mister!

260
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,087
Driver, let's go back to Seoul!

261
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,298
Driver! Let's go back to Seoul!

262
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,093
Let's go back to Seoul!
Let's go back to Seoul!

263
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,345
- Right now! Let's go back!

264
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,472
Let's go back!

265
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:51,390
Wait!

266
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,642
Let's go back! Let's go back!

267
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,143
Sorry. Sorry.

268
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,523
You're insane!

269
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,358
What's going on?

270
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,111
- Are you okay?
-  Yeah, fine.

271
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:07,781
You really scared me.

272
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,786
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

273
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,467
You are family. Understand?

274
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,059
We hope you will not judge us badly.

275
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,896
The situation back then was horrible.

276
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:07,860
Korea wasn't like it is today.

277
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,070
We had no other choice.

278
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,783
She's talking about
why they gave you away.

279
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:19,037
She says they regret it
and asks you not to judge them.

280
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:26,003
We thought about
what would be best for you.

281
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,629
We made this choice for your future.

282
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,550
Tell Yeon-hee
that we made this decision for her.

283
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,846
They thought
they were acting in your interest.

284
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,436
Has she also met her mother?

285
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:47,524
She wants to know if
you're in touch with your Korean mother.

286
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:49,693
That's not their business.

287
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,195
What did Yeon-hee say?

288
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,907
Yeon-hee's mother hasn't yet responded.

289
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:00,495
Why can't you sleep here?

290
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,456
It would be good
if you could stay one night.

291
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,252
They're sad
that you won't be staying overnight.

292
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,796
Tell her it's not possible.

293
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:15,844
Thank you, but she says
she will come back another time.

294
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,181
Do you live in Paris?

295
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:22,893
Yes.

296
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,564
Paris, parents, together?

297
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,234
No, I grew up in the countryside.

298
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:34,363
And you? You also live in Gunsan?

299
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:37,741
Gunsan? Me? No, no, no.

300
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,035
Auntie, uh...

301
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,081
Aunt live Seoul.

302
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,379
Do you have a brother or sister?

303
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:52,381
No.

304
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:55,717
Are you married?

305
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:58,387
No, I'm alone.

306
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:11,567
I don't think she lives
with her adoptive parents.

307
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,652
She isn't married yet.

308
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,072
Does she have a little time?

309
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,994
I want to show her where I grew up.

310
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,372
It's near the sea.

311
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:32,796
Your father wants to
take you to the place where he grew up.

312
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:49,479
So you're going back to Seoul
this evening?

313
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,691
No, my parents live near Jeonju.

314
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,526
We'll sleep there.

315
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,948
But what do your parents do?

316
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,410
My father is an employee in a company.

317
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,495
My mother's a French teacher.

318
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,711
That's how you learned to speak French?

319
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:13,629
Yes.

320
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:20,093
Does Yeon-hee understand Korean?

321
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:24,515
Oh, no.
I've just taught her a few easy words.

322
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,228
He's asking if you speak Korean.

323
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:12,479
Did she lack anything
when she was growing up?

324
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:19,319
He wants to know
if you lacked anything in France.

325
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,408
Tell him no.
My parents took good care of me.

326
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:32,082
She says
her adoptive parents were good to her.

327
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:36,874
Take a look.

328
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:38,750
No.

329
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,793
No need.

330
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,004
See if there's anything you need.

331
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:44,923
They're pretty.

332
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,344
How much?

333
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,388
I hate ballet shoes.

334
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,366
That island is called Mouse Poop Island.

335
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,703
We call it that because it's so small.

336
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,789
When the tide is low,

337
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:21,960
you can walk to the island,
you don't need a boat.

338
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,380
When I was a kid, me and my friends

339
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:30,093
would spend afternoons fishing there.

340
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:35,474
The adults had to come and get us by boat.

341
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:39,478
They would bawl us out every time.

342
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,232
But actually, fishing...

343
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:48,904
is their whole life
for the people who live here.

344
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:54,618
My grandfather was a fisherman,
my father was a fisherman,

345
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,663
and I was, too, for a long time.

346
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,000
Until they built the seawall.

347
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:07,172
The biggest seawall in the world,
they said on TV.

348
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,550
Today,

349
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,929
your father repairs
air-conditioning units.

350
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:22,688
Yeon-hee's mother's name is Son Mija.

351
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:27,109
Your mother's name is Son Mija.

352
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:37,870
We tried to live
with my mother in Gunsan...

353
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,708
but Mija preferred to go
and live in the city,

354
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,003
so she left.

355
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,467
Your mother wanted
to live in the city, so she left.

356
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,471
Is that all?

357
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:58,348
Wait.

358
00:34:58,348 --> 00:34:59,641
To this day...

359
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,395
I never forgot Yeon-hee.

360
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,565
I wondered...

361
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:09,151
if she was alive, where she lived.

362
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:13,822
He never stopped thinking about you.

363
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,411
He wanted to know if you were alive

364
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,705
and which country you were living in.

365
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,931
My father has arrived, we're very late.

366
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,864
Is there anything
you want to do this evening?

367
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:58,867
No, nothing.

368
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:01,870
Just fall into your bed.

369
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,518
It's your father.

370
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,523
"Yeon-hee, I am so unhappy.

371
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:35,279
I hope you now understand
why I had to let you go.

372
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:39,950
I regret the harm I have caused you.

373
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:46,832
I cry every day since..."

374
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:47,749
Tena.

375
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:50,794
Stop, please.

376
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,605
Eat.

377
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,867
-  It's delicious.
-  It's delicious!

378
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:25,162
You are welcome here.

379
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:29,833
I'm so happy
that we can spend three days together.

380
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:33,504
Your father say, "Welcome home.

381
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,593
We very happy together three days."

382
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:43,388
- Thank you.
-  Thank you!

383
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,724
My wife and children

384
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,602
knew nothing of your existence.

385
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:55,984
Hm, I did not want to cause them sorrow.

386
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,363
Not so fast, big brother,
I will translate.

387
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:05,077
Father no speaking about you

388
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:10,040
because family sad.

389
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,792
Yeah. Mm.

390
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:16,338
But when I received
the letter from Hammond,

391
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,465
I told them everything.

392
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:24,054
But Hammond called after everything speak,

393
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:28,267
all speak about you.

394
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:39,069
Why didn't you take <i>hangwa</i> cakes?
See if there are any left.

395
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,701
Take that.

396
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:06,180
Um... is it, uh, my mom? Mija?

397
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,516
Who is that?

398
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,399
She must be the caregiver at Hammond.

399
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,069
No. Uh...

400
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,487
Nurse.

401
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:24,406
Nurse.

402
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:28,452
I don't have a single photo
from back then.

403
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,248
Uh, your photos, all lost.

404
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:34,583
I'm sorry.

405
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:42,341
FRÉDÉRIQUE SHORTLY AFTER SHE CAME TO US

406
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:50,641
FRÉDÉRIQUE AND GRANNY GABRIELLE

407
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:55,270
JULIE, FRÉDÉRIQUE AND MARTIN
CHRISTMAS 1992

408
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,565
FRÉDÉRIQUE PLAYING THE PIANO

409
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,205
That's enough.

410
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:20,921
Children, go and get the video
of the two of you dancing.

411
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,090
We'll show it to your big sister.

412
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:24,925
Go along.

413
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:41,525
Sister dance video, show you.

414
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:49,491
My Lord, thank you
for having sent Yeon-hee to France

415
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,785
so that she had the chance
to get a better education.

416
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,455
Thank you for having forgiven us all...

417
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:01,003
and for having guided her to this house.

418
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,756
I have always thought about Yeon-hee.

419
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:08,802
Now I understand
that it was the Lord's way.

420
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,470
Thank you, my Lord.

421
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:17,978
In the name of Jesus Christ,
my almighty God.

422
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,314
- Amen.
-  Amen.

423
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,902
Grandmother say:

424
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:30,824
"Thanks God,
you send France for good education.

425
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:37,664
Thanks God, forgive us
and you come back Korea."

426
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:40,501
Let's eat.

427
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,086
Sister-in-law, you have worked hard.

428
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,548
It looks good.

429
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,135
Mmm. It's good.

430
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,055
-  Good?

431
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,475
Eat.

432
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,478
Delicious.

433
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:09,488
Can you ask him
to stop sending me messages?

434
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,200
He sends me every day messages in Korean.

435
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:17,663
He even calls me at night,
and I think he was really drunk

436
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:19,414
and I didn't understand anything.

437
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,709
Tell him that he has to stop.

438
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:27,673
She's talking about
the messages you sent her.

439
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,550
Did you call her when you'd been drinking?

440
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:37,349
I'd like you to come
and live here with us.

441
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,602
This is your home.

442
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,731
I will help you to marry.

443
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,442
Um...

444
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:52,406
Father say you live Korea.

445
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,825
Here is your home.

446
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:59,663
He help ma-- You marry Korean man.

447
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,544
He has to understand that I'm French now.

448
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:07,546
Mm.

449
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,798
I have my family
and my friends over there.

450
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,093
I'm not going to live in Korea.

451
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,849
Okay. Okay.

452
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,188
She says she doesn't want
to live in Korea and that she's French.

453
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:28,108
Tell her I understand.

454
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,319
Your father understand.

455
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:36,533
But everything will be easier for her
when she learns to speak Korean.

456
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,745
If you learn Korean, it will be easier.

457
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:44,583
If you learn Korean, easy for you.

458
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,667
EVERY TIME MY HUSBAND DRINKS,
HE CRIES AND SPEAKS OF YOU.

459
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,878
THE NEXT DAY, HE FORGETS EVERYTHING.

460
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:33,090
I AM GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME BACK.

461
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:37,511
Welcome.

462
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:41,139
Thank you.

463
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:19,511
My baby.

464
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,014
I am sorry.

465
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,017
Sorry, my baby.

466
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,771
Sorry, my child.

467
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:35,360
Lord, make sure she has a happy life.

468
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:40,073
My God, make sure that she is happy.

469
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,910
Thank you for bringing her back.

470
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:46,079
Thank you, Lord.

471
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,042
Our Father...

472
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:59,176
Tell her that I can drive her.

473
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:00,552
Stop it.

474
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:04,950
Hi, Mom.

475
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,285
<i>Hello, darling.</i>

476
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,287
<i>I'm so happy to hear your voice.</i>

477
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:12,207
- How are you?
-<i>Can you see me?</i>

478
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:13,500
Yes, I see you fine.

479
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:17,337
<i>How's it going?</i>

480
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:18,797
<i>Are you still in Seoul?</i>

481
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:20,632
Yes, in Seoul.

482
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:24,761
<i>Is it nice? Are you happy? What's it like?</i>

483
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:27,139
Uh, it's different.

484
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,891
Everything's different here.

485
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:30,642
Are things okay with Dad?

486
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:35,147
<i>Yes. He's going to be sad.
He's just gone out.</i>

487
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:38,317
<i>You should have warned us
you were going to call.</i>

488
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:41,486
<i>We called you loads of times.</i>

489
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:45,532
I know,
but I couldn't call you back earlier.

490
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:50,537
<i>We worry, what with all these changes.</i>

491
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,332
I sent you text messages.

492
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,502
<i>But it's not the same.</i>

493
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:01,465
<i>Sweetheart,
could you explain the plane thing?</i>

494
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:05,052
<i>Your father and I want
to understand what you did.</i>

495
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:08,347
I just needed to go somewhere.

496
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:14,811
<i>But you've always loved Japan, Tokyo.</i>

497
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:20,776
<i>Imagine our surprise
when we got messages from Seoul.</i>

498
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:23,946
But why? Japan was no longer an option.

499
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:30,202
<i>You could have called,
taken a moment to talk it over.</i>

500
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:32,246
Talk about what?

501
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,582
I was told all planes to Tokyo
were cancelled due to the typhoon.

502
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:39,336
I told them I had to go
because I had two weeks of holiday.

503
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,714
The next flight they offered
with the same company was to Seoul,

504
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:44,174
so I took it.

505
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:51,306
<i>Is this really the way
you want to tell me?</i>

506
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:59,314
<i>We always said we would go together.</i>

507
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,402
Yes, I know.

508
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,486
But, uh...

509
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,031
But I think it's good that I came alone.

510
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:14,705
I must go, Mom.

511
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,331
I'm running out of credit.

512
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:17,791
<i>Already?</i>

513
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:22,963
<i>Take care of yourself
and write to us, okay?</i>

514
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,923
Yes, I will. Give Dad a kiss from me.

515
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,968
<i>Yes, I promise I will.</i>

516
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:31,346
<i>All my love, darling.</i>

517
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:54,161
I don't understand the telegram thing.

518
00:49:54,161 --> 00:50:00,042
If you send a third telegram
and there's still no reply,

519
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:05,130
Hammond cannot send any more
for at least one year.

520
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,301
Or we would risk a complaint
for harassment.

521
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:12,346
Why not send someone?
Or a registered letter?

522
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,389
We're not even sure
it's the right address.

523
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,850
I'm sorry, but it's not possible.

524
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:20,521
I leave in two days
and will probably never come back.

525
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,773
I want my mother's address.

526
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:29,029
I understand, and I'm sorry.

527
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:33,992
I'd really like to do more,
but those are the rules.

528
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:37,621
You protect the parents
but not the children?

529
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,668
I will ask you once again, Miss Benoît,

530
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:47,714
do you wish to send the third telegram
to your mother's address?

531
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:35,596
What's wrong?

532
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:39,141
Will you come and see me in Paris?

533
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:42,895
Yes, I will.

534
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,480
We'll go to the Lot region too.

535
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,691
I'll introduce you to all my friends,

536
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,903
and we'll walk through
my favourite parts of Paris.

537
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:54,907
I'd like to go to the Jardin des Plantes.

538
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,409
Okay, we'll go.

539
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:07,419
It's my father again.
Message after message. I've had enough.

540
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:12,090
Translate some insults for me.
I'll send them to him.

541
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,637
You shouldn't say that, Freddie.

542
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,225
Why? He shouldn't write to me.
It drives me mad.

543
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:25,145
It's his way of communicating with you.

544
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:26,939
By spewing his sorrow over me?

545
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:29,483
It's the way of Korean men.

546
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,193
But I'm French.

547
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:35,572
You're also part Korean.

548
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,701
Freddie.

549
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,417
I want you stay Korea.

550
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,169
What?

551
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:53,757
You stay Korea.

552
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,760
No go France.

553
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:59,596
Why do they all want me to stay?

554
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,014
You abandon your kids

555
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,517
and after you ask them
to become good little Koreans?

556
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:07,563
What did she say?

557
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,898
You have to understand--

558
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:11,984
This music is great. What is it?

559
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:54,443
Tena.

560
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:08,040

586
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:19,379
Gift.

587
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:23,342
What is it?

588
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:25,761
Tell him I don't want his gift.

589
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:28,889
Open.

590
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,725
I have a boyfriend in France.

591
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:34,728
Boyfriend?

592
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:37,856
Why do you say that? It's not even true.

593
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:41,443
Tell her that I like her a lot...

594
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:50,661
and that I'd like our encounter
to become a deep relationship.

595
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:53,288
Tell Freddie this is what the gift means.

596
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:57,084
He says he loves you and that...

597
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:00,671
I have a boyfriend in France.
You understand? A boyfriend.

598
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,964
Stop it, Freddie.

599
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,141
You okay? Who cares? He'll get over it.

600
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,354
Are you sulking?

601
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:24,695
You're leaving too?

602
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,238
I'll go and pay.

603
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:43,922
My little Tena.

604
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:13,535
You're a very sad person.

605
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,071
Yeon-hee.

606
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,575
Why don't you answer my calls?

607
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:59,081
I called you and sent lots of messages
these past few days.

608
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,669
Why is it so hard to reach you?

609
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:09,258
And what are you doing
with a guy like this?

610
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:13,220
You can't hang out with just anyone.

611
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,597
You must not. You must not!

612
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:30,362
Mija...

613
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,409
It's all my fault.

614
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,496
I was immature.

615
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,878
Say something.

616
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:48,964
Why won't you speak to me?

617
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,216
Mija!

618
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:52,593
Freddie?

619
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,432
Tell him I never want to see him again.

620
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:06,607
Yeon-hee thanks you
for your concern for her.

621
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,318
Yeon-hee! I...

622
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:11,361
Say something.

623
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:16,241
Please, let me see you again.

624
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:19,119
Don't touch me!

625
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:56,240
TWO YEARS LATER

626
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:06,250
So, Freddie?

627
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:07,918
So, André?

628
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:14,258
- Shall we play?
- Play what? I don't normally play.

629
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,093
I'll start.

630
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:19,763
First time in Seoul.

631
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:21,765
Yes.

632
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:25,310
Business trip.

633
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,312
Five nights.

634
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,522
Six.

635
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:31,191
Married, three kids.

636
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:34,361
I'm going through my third divorce.
Four kids.

637
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:38,907
- What are you doing here?
- I came...

638
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,827
for the armament fair.

639
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:45,539
- You're a weapons dealer?
- You could say that.

640
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:47,749
That must be one crazy world.

641
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:50,335
Or they make you crazy.

642
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:54,798
Excuse me? A gin and tonic, please.

643
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:57,301
They're great here.

644
01:01:57,843 --> 01:01:58,844
Two, please.

645
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:01,138
Sorry, but wine makes me sleepy.

646
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:06,476
Why did you "match" me, as you say?

647
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:09,938
I like old guys.

648
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,317
My turn?

649
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,906
You're an artist.

650
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:20,657
No.

651
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,452
- Student.
- No.

652
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,120
What do you do, then?

653
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,082
International consulting,
in a French company.

654
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:31,251
- And your clients are Koreans?
- Yes.

655
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:33,504
In a way, you are...

656
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:35,839
a Trojan horse.

657
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,926
My boss's exact words.

658
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:40,677
Classic.

659
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:46,308
If you must know,
I wanted to fuck everything up today.

660
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:48,769
- I know that feeling.
- You do?

661
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,981
- So how do you go about it?
- I fuck everything up.

662
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:06,620
Hear that?

663
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:08,247
What?

664
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:11,542
The music.

665
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:14,586
What music?

666
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,173
It's coming from inside.

667
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:24,555
I love this song.

668
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:32,020
I hear it.

669
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:34,982
Ah.

670
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:43,031
Thank you.

671
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:47,661
I'm 27 today.

672
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,248
I hate birthdays.

673
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:54,710
I always ask myself
the same question on my birthday.

674
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,421
What question?

675
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,049
Did my mother...

676
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,510
think about me?

677
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:05,596
Somewhere?

678
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:10,851
Cheers.

679
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:22,905
- Well?
- Excellent.

680
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,492
Tell me about the weapons.

681
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,411
Weapons! Are you really interested?

682
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,831
- Yes.
- Weapons aren't the exciting part.

683
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:34,958
It's the stakes you have to face.

684
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:40,255
It usually ends in a hostess bar
at 4 in the morning.

685
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:45,636
There are only men in this profession,
but you would be brilliant at it.

686
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:47,679
Yeah? Why?

687
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:50,807
Because you have to be able
to not look back.

688
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:58,607
Is this a booty call or a job interview?

689
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:04,446
Shall we go to your room?

690
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:07,908
- No dinner first?
- I don't have time.

691
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:10,953
Okay, then.

692
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:14,164
But...

693
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,543
I'm not 20 anymore.

694
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,351
Hey.

695
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,771
I need to pee.

696
01:06:30,866 --> 01:06:32,951
I thought you'd be back before midnight.

697
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:35,495
Oh, sorry, I had a Tinder date.

698
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:41,585
Had a good day?

699
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,129
Yeah, fine.

700
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:46,715
Did you finish it?

701
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:49,468
-  Yes. Want to see?
- Sure.

702
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:43,021
It's beautiful, Kay-Kay. I love it.

703
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:45,190
You're sure?

704
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,068
Yeah, I'm sure.

705
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:56,910
You look tired.

706
01:07:57,578 --> 01:08:00,497
No, it's okay,
I just need a ten-minute nap,

707
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:02,165
and after, I'll be fine to go out.

708
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:32,446
Surprise.

709
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:35,115
Wait...

710
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:38,327
Where are you going?

711
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,461
You know I hate my birthday.

712
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:49,087
I know.

713
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:53,966
But they came for you.

714
01:08:58,846 --> 01:08:59,680
Please.

715
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,878
Happy birthday!

716
01:10:52,878 --> 01:10:55,547
-  You really fooled me earlier.
- Sorry.

717
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:56,924
Thanks.

718
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:03,972
She's my little sister, Lucie.

719
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:06,642
No, I'm not her little sister.

720
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:10,062
Come here.

721
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:25,744
-  You okay?
- I think I'm a little strung out.

722
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,386
Aren't you going to open it?

723
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,514
I'll open it tomorrow.

724
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:48,642
There's a lot of people.
Am I the only one from work?

725
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,354
Ask Kay-Kay, but I hope so.

726
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:57,401
What are you looking for?

727
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:01,530
My bottle of...

728
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:03,615
absinthe.

729
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,033
I can't find it.

730
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,118
Want me to help?

731
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:16,920
Freddie?

732
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:20,007
I've got an appointment with Hammond.

733
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,390
How long have you been here?

734
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:30,893
Three months.

735
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,730
I told you to go there right away.

736
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:40,444
But I was told not to rush
into the first meeting

737
01:12:40,444 --> 01:12:41,987
with the biological parents.

738
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:43,405
If there is a meeting.

739
01:12:50,078 --> 01:12:54,291
I was told to learn the culture,
speak the language,

740
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:57,336
talk to other adoptees.

741
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:05,427
Come and see.

742
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:30,953
What are you looking for?

743
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:31,870
The toilets.

744
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:33,830
Downstairs.

745
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:39,456
What's wrong?

746
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:44,169
My mother responded.

747
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:51,593
Your biological mother?

748
01:15:55,472 --> 01:15:57,266
After six telegrams in two years.

749
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:02,271
Today?

750
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,524
No, ten days ago.

751
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:09,319
A letter addressed to Hammond.

752
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,452
She said she didn't want to see me.

753
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,501
It was a short message.

754
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,466
Twenty-two words.

755
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:04,286
Thanks for the radish kimchi!

756
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:06,663
I ate it all!

757
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:08,624
What?

758
01:19:11,585 --> 01:19:13,670
Thank you for the radish kimchi!

759
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:19,551
You did the right thing!

760
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:20,529
YEON-HEE, WHERE ARE YOU?

761
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:24,449
YEON-HEE, WHERE ARE YOU?
IN KOREA? I WANT TO SEE YOU.

762
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:28,370
I DON'T DRINK LIKE I USED TO.
IF YOU'RE HERE, I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.

763
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,549
YEON-HEE, I SAW THEY TALKED
ABOUT FRANCE ON THE NEWS.

764
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:46,471
ARE YOU IN PARIS? KOREA?
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

765
01:20:55,355 --> 01:21:01,028
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

766
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:32,369
-  <i>Well, well, Freddie.</i>
- André.

767
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:34,121
<i>Already missing me?</i>

768
01:22:56,935 --> 01:23:01,899
FIVE YEARS LATER

769
01:23:26,507 --> 01:23:27,549
Maxime.

770
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:32,846
What should I wear?

771
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:36,600
Do you think the dress is too formal?

772
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:39,645
You're overthinking it.

773
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:40,729
Go with your gut.

774
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,690
No, seriously. Which do you prefer?

775
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,568
Shit.

776
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:48,904
What?

777
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:54,201
We forgot your ballet shoes.

778
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:57,663
Idiot!

779
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,668
No, really,

780
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:06,713
you haven't seen him for seven years,
wear something comfortable.

781
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,048
That's all.

782
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,301
Come and see.

783
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:36,869
Thanks for being here.

784
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:09,985
Could you text my parents
to say we've arrived?

785
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:13,155
- Shouldn't you do that?
- No, they love you.

786
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:14,323
I have to call André.

787
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,158
Okay.

788
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:28,921
-  <i>Well? How are you feeling?</i>
- Okay, so far.

789
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:31,590
<i>It's funny
to do something here again, huh?</i>

790
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:35,469
<i>You're even more elegant than in Paris.</i>

791
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:38,472
- Do we go together tomorrow?
-<i>No.</i>

792
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:40,807
<i>I'll go ahead to sort the file
with the Koreans.</i>

793
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,560
- Okay.
<i>- No, wait.</i>

794
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:47,064
<i>I assure you,
they know you haven't made a decision.</i>

795
01:25:47,814 --> 01:25:49,775
<i>No one wants to force you.</i>

796
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:53,695
<i>I told them our deal.
Tomorrow is just a first meeting.</i>

797
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:55,030
<i>No pressure.</i>

798
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:57,866
Yeah, I know your "no pressure."

799
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:00,786
<i>But they really like your profile.</i>

800
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,081
<i>Know what
the missile-division boss calls you?</i>

801
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:05,707
<i>The James Bond Girl.</i>

802
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:09,336
- Okay, André. Bye.
-  <i>Bye.</i>

803
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:22,891
This place is toxic for me.

804
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:25,811
I'll need you.

805
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,856
Don't worry. I'm here.

806
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:31,066
I'm serious, Maxime.

807
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:45,163
Delicious.

808
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:51,044
This happened in France?

809
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:53,088
No, in Thailand.

810
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,466
We've got the accident there,

811
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:59,761
so I decided to have
the operation in Bangkok.

812
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,557
The accident was in Thailand.

813
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:06,059
But tell him it's nothing serious.

814
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,437
And your friend okay?

815
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:12,733
Oh, yeah. Only scratches.

816
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:13,734
Uh...

817
01:27:13,734 --> 01:27:16,820
It's Freddie who was driving
the scooter, of course.

818
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:18,906
Look.

819
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:38,550
Touch.

820
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:45,557
Touch it.

821
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:19,383
Why didn't you tell us?

822
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,640
Eat. Eat.

823
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:36,275
Um...

824
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,278
I'm sorry for restaurant.

825
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:42,114
I don't know you stop meat now.

826
01:28:42,114 --> 01:28:44,616
Oh, it's okay, it's fine. Don't worry.

827
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:50,914
It's so good. Really.

828
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:54,334
It's, um-- [in Korean] It's delicious.

829
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:55,502
It's delicious!

830
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:00,257
Yes.

831
01:29:05,846 --> 01:29:06,847
Thank you.

832
01:29:18,984 --> 01:29:19,818
Thank you.

833
01:29:20,986 --> 01:29:22,988
I don't drink alcohol.

834
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:26,325
- Really?
-  No.

835
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:29,494
No meat, no alcohol?

836
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:30,412
No.

837
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:33,582
It's not for ecological reasons,

838
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:36,960
but, um, I never felt so good in my life.

839
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:39,838
Yes or no?

840
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:43,008
Alcohol, stop.

841
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:45,135
Alcohol, stop?

842
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:46,220
Alcohol, stop!

843
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:48,013
Okay.

844
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,098
Alcohol, stop?

845
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:52,059
Okay.

846
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:54,228
Tomorrow, no more.

847
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:55,938
He'll stop tomorrow.

848
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:58,398
-  Tomorrow, stop.

849
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:11,787
He's changed since the last time.

850
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:14,581
He almost looks younger. Weird.

851
01:30:18,877 --> 01:30:20,921
He looks like the photos you showed me.

852
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:23,423
You think?

853
01:30:24,424 --> 01:30:25,259
Yes.

854
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:35,894
I wish you had warned me earlier.

855
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:40,774
It's a pity you're not coming to Gunsan.

856
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:45,904
It's not possible. I came for work.

857
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:47,990
You work here?

858
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:50,158
I'm just here for a mission.

859
01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:52,160
What does she do?

860
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:55,706
Uh, he ask, what is your job?

861
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:59,251
Mm... I sell missiles.

862
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:00,752
"Missiles"?

863
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:03,255
She sells missiles.

864
01:31:04,131 --> 01:31:06,008
- Oh, missiles.
-  Missiles.

865
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:10,971
I work for a French group,

866
01:31:10,971 --> 01:31:13,390
which collaborates
with many other countries

867
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,185
like Taiwan or Colombia.

868
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:20,898
And we help them to improve
their national defence system.

869
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:23,775
She sells weapons to make war?

870
01:31:24,443 --> 01:31:25,986
For the war?

871
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:29,114
No, for peace. In theory.

872
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:33,327
And you come to Korea to sell missiles?

873
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:34,703
Actually...

874
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:39,708
Freddie thinks maybe it's,
uh, her destiny.

875
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:40,876
Destiny?

876
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:45,714
Yeah, she left for France
when she was a baby.

877
01:31:45,714 --> 01:31:49,551
And now that she's an adult,
she's coming back

878
01:31:50,052 --> 01:31:55,474
to defend South Korea against North Korea.

879
01:31:57,476 --> 01:31:58,477
Hm...

880
01:31:59,353 --> 01:32:00,646
From what he says,

881
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:07,027
it's Yeon-hee's destiny
to help South Korea against North Korea.

882
01:32:08,987 --> 01:32:10,364
Really?

883
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:19,665
My father wants to play
some music he wrote for me.

884
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:24,878
He recently started to play the piano.
He composes during his free time.

885
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:27,840
What a coincidence.

886
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,551
Yeah, weird.

887
01:33:59,515 --> 01:34:04,102
Not bad for someone self-taught.

888
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:10,400
What?

889
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:20,285
I'm happy that me and him,
we can exchange normal text messages now.

890
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:22,704
He is happy too.

891
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:26,750
Is his health okay?

892
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,044
Does he still drink a lot?

893
01:34:29,044 --> 01:34:32,381
No, uh, he drinks less.

894
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:47,271
Where did he go?

895
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:49,147
He looking for a taxi.

896
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:56,071
It's here, let's go.

897
01:34:57,906 --> 01:34:59,741
Come on, the taxi's here!

898
01:35:21,096 --> 01:35:22,681
I'm sorry for this.

899
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:25,809
Nice to meet you.

900
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:27,060
I don't understand.

901
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:28,687
Uh, taxi.

902
01:35:29,688 --> 01:35:31,064
Bye. Bye.

903
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:39,489
Hyehwa Station!

904
01:35:40,324 --> 01:35:41,283
Bye.

905
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:43,160
Bye.

906
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:00,385
Was that normal?

907
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:07,059
To the guesthouse?

908
01:36:18,445 --> 01:36:21,073
It's striking
how much you resemble your father.

909
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:28,121
Take us to the Itaewon area.

910
01:36:28,914 --> 01:36:30,666
So you're partying tonight?

911
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:31,875
Yes.

912
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:36,713
We're not going to the guesthouse?

913
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:40,551
No, I changed my mind.

914
01:36:58,527 --> 01:37:01,029
I could wipe you from my life
with a snap of my fingers.

915
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:04,324
What?

916
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:09,329
I could wipe you from my life...

917
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:11,790
with a snap of my fingers.

918
01:39:19,251 --> 01:39:21,003
Hello? This is Frédérique Benoît.

919
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:23,547
You just sent me a message.

920
01:39:29,887 --> 01:39:31,013
<i>Yes, still in Seoul.</i>

921
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:37,769
<i>Yes, I can come.</i>

922
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:40,939
<i>No, I can come today.</i>

923
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,003
JEONJU

924
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:24,650
Is this where I was abandoned?

925
01:40:25,817 --> 01:40:30,072
No, the old Jeonju Hammond
was in another neighbourhood.

926
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:35,494
The building was destroyed
and Hammond moved here in the 2000s.

927
01:40:36,912 --> 01:40:38,080
You're very young.

928
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:45,963
This is your original adoption file.

929
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:49,007
You received a copy in Seoul.

930
01:41:15,534 --> 01:41:17,077
Are we sure she will come?

931
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:19,705
We can never be certain,

932
01:41:19,705 --> 01:41:24,376
but the tone of your mother on the phone
suggests she will come.

933
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:28,505
You came early.

934
01:41:29,256 --> 01:41:30,257
Yes, that's true.

935
01:41:34,386 --> 01:41:35,554
Yes?

936
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:43,270
I've brought you some hot tea.

937
01:41:45,272 --> 01:41:46,398
Thank you.

938
01:42:09,796 --> 01:42:13,133
I'll now explain what will follow.

939
01:42:14,343 --> 01:42:20,349
When your mother arrives,
she will be settled in the room next door.

940
01:42:20,349 --> 01:42:24,478
It's more or less the same layout
and size as this one.

941
01:42:25,521 --> 01:42:29,233
Then someone will tell us
that she has arrived.

942
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:34,863
I will go to speak
to your mother separately

943
01:42:34,863 --> 01:42:36,949
to prepare her for the meeting.

944
01:42:37,616 --> 01:42:39,868
Like we are doing now.

945
01:42:41,495 --> 01:42:46,166
When your mother is ready,
I will bring her here.

946
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:50,587
Do you accept
that I be present during the meeting?

947
01:42:52,673 --> 01:42:54,132
Yes, all right.

948
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:04,643
Yes?

949
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:09,690
The mother has arrived.

950
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:30,502
- Wait. Wait.
- Yes?

951
01:43:30,502 --> 01:43:33,297
There's something I don't understand.

952
01:43:33,881 --> 01:43:34,923
Tell me.

953
01:43:37,426 --> 01:43:42,097
I thought that once parents had
refused to see their child...

954
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:47,686
Hammond could send no more telegrams.

955
01:43:48,187 --> 01:43:49,855
Yes, that's the law.

956
01:43:52,024 --> 01:43:53,066
But then...

957
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:59,031
why did you accept my request
for my mother?

958
01:44:02,701 --> 01:44:05,078
Perhaps we have employees

959
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:08,248
who understand the feelings
of an adopted child.

960
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:12,586
Is that all?

961
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:58,090
Freddie, your mother has arrived.

962
01:44:59,007 --> 01:45:00,968
This is your daughter, Freddie.

963
01:45:12,062 --> 01:45:14,106
Can I touch her?

964
01:45:16,108 --> 01:45:16,942
Yes.

965
01:47:02,506 --> 01:47:06,051
ONE YEAR LATER

966
01:48:05,777 --> 01:48:06,612
Hello.

967
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:09,865
Hello, madam.

968
01:48:11,533 --> 01:48:13,243
Do you have a room available?

969
01:48:14,328 --> 01:48:16,246
Sure. For how many nights?

970
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:17,831
Just one night.

971
01:48:18,332 --> 01:48:19,333
Wait a second.

972
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:24,463
Single or double room?

973
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:25,756
Single room, please.

974
01:48:32,387 --> 01:48:34,473
- Your passport, please?
- Yeah.

975
01:48:54,493 --> 01:48:55,494
Happy birthday.

976
01:48:58,413 --> 01:48:59,248
Thank you.

977
01:49:02,793 --> 01:49:05,504
I need you to wait a bit
for us to prepare your room.

978
01:49:06,004 --> 01:49:06,839
Okay.

979
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:09,299
- Can I use the bathroom?
- Sure.

980
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:12,344
You take the stairs here
on the first floor.

981
01:50:12,029 --> 01:50:15,032
MOM, SORRY I DIDN'T WRITE.

982
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:26,460
I THINK I'M HAPPY.

983
01:50:30,547 --> 01:50:33,550
I HOPE YOU ARE TOO.

984
01:50:38,263 --> 01:50:41,892
YEON-HEE

985
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:50,943
NEW MESSAGE

986
01:51:00,244 --> 01:51:01,620
NO SUBJECT

987
01:51:20,013 --> 01:51:21,056
