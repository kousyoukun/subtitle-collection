不旅行。你会和我在一起。
Don't trip. You'll be right there with me.

88
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,395
妈的，总得有人帮我拿行李。
Shit, someone gotta carry my bags.

89
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,264
-兄弟，你为什么要这样和我玩，兄弟?
- Bro, why you gotta play with me like that, bro?

90
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,869
我已经知道我想要什么了。你得到了什么?
I already know what I want. What you getting?

91
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,505
樱桃派，苹果派。-樱桃派?

我叫唐尼。你现在还记得我吗?

阿多尼斯·奎迪与老对手作战
as Adonis Creed battles his old rival

103
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,405
奎迪说这将是他的最后一战
in what Creed has said will be his final fight.

104
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,108
托德·格里沙姆和冠军杰西卡·麦卡斯基尔。
Todd Grisham alongside the champion, Jessica McCaskill.

105
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,244
一出场就有令人印象深刻的组合。
And right out of the gate with an impressive combo.

106
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:00,448
康兰看起来这么好，还是奎迪看起来这么糟?
Is Conlan looking this good or Creed looking this bad?

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,383
如果他不尽快采取行动
If he doesn't do something fast,

108
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,151
他即将结束自己历史性的职业生涯
he's going to end his historic career

109
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,720
又输给了康兰
with another loss to Conlan.

110
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,288
-好了。-给他脸上来一拳。
-There we go. -Put that jab in his face.

111
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,859
好的。同样的信条。什么都没变。
Okay. Same Creed. Ain't nothing changed.

112
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,396
康兰跟踪他的猎物
Conlan stalking his prey,

113
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,131
把奎迪推向角落。
pushing Creed towards the corner.

114
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,299
你一定会好奇
You've got to wonder

115
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,468
如果这一刻到了奎迪这里。
if the moment is getting to Creed here.

116
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,473
康兰正在用右手猛击。
Conlan is banging away with the right hand.

117
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,141
看你的右边。
Look to your right.

118
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,676
似乎是相同的组合
Seems to be the same combination

119
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,778
他一遍又一遍地扔，奎迪也阻止不了。
he's throwing over and over, and Creed can't stop it.

120
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:38,119
奎迪，从角落出来。
Creed, getting out of the corner.

121
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,789
打得好，但康兰一点也不害怕。
Good jab, but Conlan not fazed at all.

122
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,925
对着他的脸。保持那一拳。
Keep that in his face. Keep that jab out there.

123
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,161
-康兰的左拳。-从绳子上下来。
- Big left from Conlan.  -Get off that rope.

124
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,864
他把他逼上绝路了。干净利落的落地镜头。
Oh, he's got him on the ropes. Clean shots landing.

125
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,732
奎迪遭受了不小的打击。
Creed taking quite a beating.

126
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,936
-哇。康兰差点就抓到他了。
- And wow. Conlan almost had him.

127
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,006
下一回合会很疼的，冠军。下一回合会疼的。
Next round's gonna hurt, champ. Next round's gonna hurt.

128
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:01,809
你没事吧，唐尼?
You okay, Donnie?

129
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,278
来吧，唐尼。你得工作，宝贝。
Come on, Donnie. You gotta work, baby.

130
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,847
你笑什么，兄弟?
Yo, what you smiling for, dawg?

131
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,016
他在那边比上次打得更狠。
He over there beating you worse than last time.

132
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,118
我想念的东西是不是很有趣?
Like, is something I miss that's funny?

133
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:13,988
是的,男人。将军。
Yeah, man. Checkmate.

134
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,324
将军吗?哦,好的。你确定吗?
Checkmate? Oh, okay. You sure about that?

135
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,560
我从来都不怕接触。
I ain't never been scared of a little contact.

136
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,630
我要怎么进来就怎么出去。
I'm going out how I came in.

137
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,499
伙计，你疯了，好吧。
Man, you're crazy, all right.

138
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,943
别玩了，把他打晕。
Stop playing, knock him out.

139
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,037
-你感觉怎么样?看起来棒极了。-我只是在热身。
- How you feeling? Looking great. - I'm just warming up.

140
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:32,006
他跑得不错。
He had a good run.

141
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,707
但是时候夺回属于我们的东西了。
But it's time to take back what's ours.

142
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,560
奎迪的事业很辉煌
Creed's had a remarkable career,

143
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,395
但你想知道时间老人是否终于赶上了冠军。
but you wonder if Father Time has finally caught up with the champ.

144
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,063
这对奎迪来说越来越危险了。
This is getting dangerous for Creed.

145
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:59,700
哦，冠军终于落地了。
Ooh, the champ finally lands one.

146
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,870
来吧，唐尼。这工作。让他看看谁是冠军。
Come on, Donnie. Work this. Show him who's champ.

147
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,106
美丽,瑞奇。美丽。就像这样。
Beautiful, Ricky. Beautiful. Just like that.

148
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,140
再来一次。
One more time.

149
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,560
康兰倒下了!他倒下了!
And down goes Conlan! He goes down!

150
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:28,530
多么美妙的时刻!我觉得他起不来了，杰西卡。
What a moment! And I don't think he's gonna get up, Jessica.

151
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:32,366
三，四，五，
Three, four, five,

152
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,401
6、7、
six, seven,

153
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,570
八个
eight,

154
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,304
九个
nine,

155
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,405
十个
ten.

156
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,373
是啊!
Yeah!

157
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,542
就这样了，伙计们。
And that's it, folks.

158
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,709
这是结束了。
It's over.

159
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,044
阿多尼斯·奎迪真是一招棋。
What a chess move from Adonis Creed.

160
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,146
让人难以置信。
Just incredible.

161
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,214
真是个转折。好一个结局。
What a turn. What an ending.

162
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:50,217
这就是你出去的方式。
That's how you go out.

163
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,521
谁会对阿多尼斯·奎迪有所期待呢
Who would expect anything less from Adonis Creed

164
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:55,756
当他在世界舞台上做最后的鞠躬时?
as he takes his final bow on the world stage?

165
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,924
多好的出口啊。
What an exit.

166
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,059
尊重,Conlan。一场惨烈的战斗。
Respect, Conlan. Hell of a fight.

167
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:02,429
这意味着我们有了一个新的，无可争议的
And that means we've got a new, undisputed

168
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,831
世界重量级拳王
heavyweight champion of the world

169
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,000
二十年来第一次，
for the first time in two decades,

170
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,335
他叫阿多尼斯·奎迪。
and his name is Adonis Creed.

171
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,709
有什么事吗?
What's up?

172
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,669
你不记得了。
You don't remember.

173
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,504
记住什么?
Remember what?

174
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,841
来吧,爸爸。你承诺。
C'mon, Daddy. You promised.

175
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,677
五分钟。
Five minutes.

176
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,994
好的，好的，好的。
Okay, okay, okay.

177
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,203
是的。好吧。
Yes. All right.

178
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,419
再来点茶吗，公主?
Would you like some more tea, princess?

179
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,088
是的。谢谢你，好心的先生。
Yes. Thank you, kind sir.

180
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,038

185
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,686
这太热了。
This is hot.

186
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,086
-是吗?-是的,是的。
-Yeah? -Yeah, yeah.

187
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,622
这就是你为柯兰妮准备的曲目吗?
This the track you've been working on for Kehlani?

188
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:08,922
-是的。-好的。
-Yeah. -Okay.

189
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,592
我们聊得很愉快，但我不知道。
We had a good session, but I don't know.

190
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,761
你不知道是什么意思?你能把这个寄给我吗?
What you mean you don't know? Can you send this to me?

191
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,562
-是的,是的。-我需要把这个放在车里。
-Yes, yes. -I need this in the car.

192
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,929
今天怎么样?
How was today?

193
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,431
-很好。是的。-是吗?
-It was good. Yeah. -Yeah?

194
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,267
-谢谢你按住它。-我抓到你了。
-Thank you for holding it down. -I got you.

195
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,703
你哄她上床了吗?
Did you get her to bed?

196
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:22,970
我所做的。-嗯。
-I did. -Mmm.

197
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,539
所以，我不会撒谎。
So, I'm not gonna lie.

198
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,407
我只好用六勺冰淇淋贿赂她。
I had to bribe her with about six scoops of ice cream.

199
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,808
我都不知道她怎么睡得着。
I don't even know how she sleep.

200
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,877
退休让你变软了，你知道吗?
Retirement made you soft, you know that?

201
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,579
我不能拒绝那个女孩。
I can't tell that girl no.

202
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:34,048
我想你也喝了几勺，因为你有这个。
I think you had a couple scoops too 'cause look, you got this.

203
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,115
-嗯。-嗯。
-Mmm. -Uh-huh.

204
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,751
-是啊，太糟糕了。-是的。
- Yeah, that's bad. - Yeah.

205
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:38,520
在弄脏之前把它拿下来，D。
Take that off before it stains, D.

206
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,388
我知道你想干什么了。
Oh, I see what you're trying to do.

207
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,757
那是什么?
What's that?

208
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,726
你想让我脱光衣服。
You're trying to get me naked.

209
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,161
哦，不，不。我绝对不会这么做，因为我在努力工作。
Oh, no, no. I'm definitely not trying to do that 'cause I'm trying to work.

210
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,563
我知道你想干什么了。
I see what you were trying to do.

211
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,497
不，你可以拥有它。没关系。
No, you can just own it. It's okay.

212
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:51,965
我知道你只是想看看这些。
I know you just wanna see all this.

213
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,568
-不不不。-看啊。
- No, no, no. - Look at that.

214
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,636
不。
No.

215
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,271
还热吗?还热吗?
Still hot? Still warm?

216
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,273
-别说了。我在工作，d。
- Stop it. I'm working, D. Please.

217
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,308
我也在工作。听着，我没机会
I'm working too. Listen, I don't get a chance to--

218
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,110
你在忙什么?
What are you working on?

219
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,814
我再也没有单独和你在一起的时间了，因为你在努力工作。
I don't get no alone time with you no more 'cause you be hard at work.

220
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:06,914
我知道。是的。
I know. Yeah.

221
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,783
-你没时间陪我。-我知道。
-You ain't got no time for me. -I know.

222
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,351
你没时间做
You ain't got time for--

223
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,654
-我知道，但是我现在没有时间。-来吧。你不?
-I know, but I don't have time now. -So come on. You don't?

224
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,888
——没有。不。-只有一点点。只有一点点。
- No. No. - Just a little bit. Just a little bit.

225
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,827
-嗯。-嗯。嗯哼。
-Mmm. -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

226
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:21,862
难道你不怀念……
Don't you miss when...

227
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:25,633
我们曾经... ...任何地方。
we used to... ...anywhere.

228
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,868
-有地方吗?——嗯。
- Any place? - Mm-hmm.

229
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,937
唔唔。好的。
Mm-mmm. Okay.

230
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,138
好吧，走吧。
Okay, let's go.

231
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,207
好吧，我只有15分钟的时间
Okay, I just-- I have, like, about 15 minutes

232
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,376
-因为我必须送这些茎。-十五。
-because I have to send these stems. -Fifteen.

233
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,678
12点怎么样?
How about 12?

234
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,212
好吧。12个就够了。
All right. Twelve will do.

235
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:46,086
<i>下一站，Leimert公园
<i>Next stop, Leimert Park.</i>

236
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,713
的身体,头。的身体,头。
Body, head. Body, head.

237
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,249
效率胜于力量，宝贝。给他吧。
Efficiency over power, baby. Give it to him.

238
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,822
技术。技术,费利克斯。
Technique. Technique, Felix.

239
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:23,257
你不能一拳打穿德拉戈。
You can't just punch your way through Drago.

240
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,393
我们有个计划，照做就好。
We got a plan, so stick to it.

241
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,495
-来吧。让他为之努力。-走吧。
- Come on. Make him work for it. - Let's go.

242
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,098
这不仅仅关乎权力。关键在于时机和速度。
It's not only about power. It's timing, speed.

243
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,400
-妈的，你是在告诉我?来吧。我知道，我知道。
-Shit, you're telling me? Come on now. -I know, I know.

244
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:34,903
继续追问他。
Keep drilling into him.

245
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,037
技术。技术。
Technique. Technique.

246
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,372
时间。
Time.

247
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,107
嘿!时间!
Hey! Time!

248
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,576
费利克斯。过来。
Felix. Get over here.

249
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,013
这些人都是垃圾。
These guys are trash.

250
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,015
我们需要一批新货，而且要快。
We need a new batch, and we need it fast.

251
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,417
是很困难的。你已经嚼遍了大半个洛杉矶。
It's hard. You've chewed through most of LA.

252
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,086
你想让我退缩吗?你知道德拉戈很不容易。
You want me to pull back? You know Drago ain't taking it easy.

253
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,539
我们是来训练的，是来战斗的，不是吗?
We're here to train, we're here to fight, aren't we?

254
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,417
你教会了我，这就是我们要做的。
You taught me that and that is what we are going to do.

255
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,630
嘿,费利克斯。<我> Ven aqui。< / i >好吧…
Hey, Felix. <i>Ven aqui.</i> Okay...

256
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,032
怎么了，冠军?你想帮我打几轮吗?
What's up, champ? You wanna help me with some rounds?

257
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,401
怎么，弄脏这套衣服吗?我不这么想。
What, and mess up this suit? I don't think so.

258
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,571
我是想给你钱，费里斯。
I'm trying to get you paid, Felix.

259
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,271
如果你一直昏倒，我们就没钱给你了
We can't get you paid if you keep knocking out

260
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,941
所有这些陪练，好吗?
all these sparring partners, okay?

261
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,075
你得准备好四周后和德拉戈决斗。
You gotta be ready to fight Drago in four weeks.

262
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,311
你是冠军。我们知道你有力量。
You're the champ. We know you got power.

263
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,413
但这并不总是关于你能打多重。
But it's not always about how hard you can hit.

264
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,883
-关于控制和专注。你是对的。
-It's about control and focus. -You're right.

265
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,116
听杜克说。
Listen to Duke.

266
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,086
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,790
看到了吗?你玩得太多了。
See? You play too much.

268
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,625
-听杜克的话。-你听到了吗?
- Listen to Duke. - Did you hear that?

269
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,459
“听杜克的。”
"Listen to Duke."

270
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,329
这三个字。不是"我爱你"
Those three words. Not "I love you."

271
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,966
不是“放轻松”。都不是。
Not "take it easy." None of that.

272
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,934
“听杜克的。”
"Listen to Duke."

273
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,436
我完全明白他们在问什么。
I understand exactly what they're asking.

274
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,073
德拉戈的名气更大，没错，但菲力克斯拿到了腰带。
Drago's got a bigger name, that's true, but Felix got the belt.

275
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,442
他的裂缝一定更大。
His split's got to be bigger.

276
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,011
我不在乎他们喜不喜欢。让德拉戈给我打电话。
I don't care if they don't like it. Tell Drago to call me.

277
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,381
我一会打给你。
Hey, let me call you right back.

278
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,016
嘿，伙计。
Hey, my man.

279
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,186
我能帮你吗?
Can I help you?

280
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,155
-让我签个名。-不，我不会签名的。
-Let me get an autograph. -No, I ain't signing no autographs.

281
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,190
你能从我的车上下来吗?
Would you get off my car?

282
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:06,995
哦,家的。
Oh, homey.

283
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,063
你不记得我了，是吗?
You don't remember me, huh?

284
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:14,969
你从你妈的烂车里走出来了。
You come a long way from bumming rides from your mom.

285
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,673
爵士。
Dame.

286
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,509
天啊，你征服了我。
Boy, you had me.

287
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,012
达米安。
Damian.

288
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,513
是啊，刚回到兜帽区。
Yeah, just got back to the hood.

289
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:27,515
去了趟旧健身房，但是…
Stopped by the old gym, but, uh...

290
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,217
是啊，我们几年前就升级了?
Yeah, we upgraded a couple years ago, you know?

291
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,318
我明白了。
I see.

292
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,691
-该死，这…-有一分钟了。
-Damn, it's, uh... -It's been a minute.

293
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:38,860
有一分钟了。
Been a minute.

294
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,565
嘿，我不想占用你的时间，伙计。
Hey, I don't wanna take up your time or nothing, man.

295
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:45,332
我只是想让你知道什么是好的。
I just wanted to let you know what's good.

296
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,834
我周围。
I'm around.

297
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,069
如果你想叙叙旧，就告诉我一声。
If you wanna catch up, you know, you just let me know.

298
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,345
你现在要去哪里?
Where you about to head now?

299
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,382
该死，回婴儿床去。
Shit, back to the crib.

300
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,085
有时间去吃点东西吗?
You got time to get some grub?

301
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,421
谢谢你！
Thank you.

302
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,591
-谢谢。——享受。
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

303
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:21,936
我很惊讶你还来这里和老百姓一起吃饭。
I'm surprised you still come here and eat with the common folk.

304
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:24,404
我是说，当我可以的时候。
I mean, when I can.

305
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,908
我以前做的很多事情现在都做不到了。
There's a lot of things I used to do that I can't do anymore.

306
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,442
忙着过那种奢华的生活吧?
Busy living that high life, huh?

307
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,410
是的。我猜这是工作带来的。
Yeah. Guess it comes with the job.

308
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,347
好吧。
All right.

309
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,717
慢点，慢点。该死,bruh。
Yo-- Easy, easy. Damn, bruh.

310
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,619
你知道我有多久没吃过这玩意儿了吗?
You know how long it's been since I had this shit?

311
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:40,555
多久?
How long?

312
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,456
十八年了，兄弟。
Eighteen years, bro.

313
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,459
你一直都很消沉?
You've been down this whole time?

314
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,633
虽然多了几年，但是…是的。
Had a few years tacked on, but... yeah.

315
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,268
上周刚出狱。
Just got out last week.

316
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,640
好吧，恭喜你。
Well, congratulations on that.

317
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,609
谢谢你！
Thank you.

318
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,646
给你写过几次信。
Wrote you a few times.

319
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,750
你吗?你把他们送到哪里去了?妈妈的信条。
-You did? Where'd you send 'em? -Mama Creed's.

320
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,088
她还在贝艾尔吗?
She still up in Bel Air?

321
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,623
是的，她还在那儿。同样的房子。
Yeah, she's still there. Same house.

322
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,659
但我一直没拿到。
But I never got 'em.

323
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,168
你知道我在围栏里看了你的每一场比赛。
You know I watched every one of your fights in the pen.

324
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,837
你终于来到非洲了?
You finally made it to Africa, huh?

325
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:33,173
-你看到了吗?看到这一点。
-You seen that? -Saw that.

326
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,511
你结束竞选的方式让我很骄傲。
Made me proud how you ended your run.

327
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:39,179
看来你还记得我教你的那些招式。
Look like you still remember some of them moves I taught you.

328
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:43,017
你知道我记得什么吗?
You know what I remember?

329
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,386
你把我打晕了。
You knocking my ass out.

330
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,060
你知道我记得什么吗?
You know what I remember?

331
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,328
帮你振作起来。
Helping your big ass back up.

332
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,165
还记得吗?
Remember that?

333
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,002
-是的，你说了。-那好吧。
-Yeah, you did. -All right, then.

334
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,241
你有工作吗?
You got work?

335
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:12,880
我有安排了。
I got plans.

336
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,884
保持我的清白。别让我的警察来烦我。
Keep my nose clean. Keep my PO off my ass.

337
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:17,919
毫米。
Mm.

338
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,459
听着，如果有什么我能帮你的，
Listen, if there's anything I can do for you,

339
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,996
如果需要我帮忙，尽管开口。
if I can help at all, just ask.

340
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,701
我在说什么?你刚回家。
What am I talking about? You just came home.

341
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:40,875
你需要什么都行。Aight吗?别犹豫，兄弟。
Whatever you need. Aight? Don't hesitate, bruh.

342
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,981
我是直男，兄弟。
I'm straight, bro.

343
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:48,916
我很好。我都安排好了。
I'm good. I got it all situated.

344
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,185
我不是来找你的。
I ain't come to see you for no handout.

345
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:52,787
不，我不是那个意思。这是……
Nah, I didn't mean it like that. It was...

346
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:55,757
尊重。
Respect.

347
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:01,896
那么，计划是什么?
So, what's the plan?

348
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,531
和你上次见我时的节目一样。
Same program last time you saw me.

349
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,201
我想成为冠军。
I wanna be champ.

350
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,273
你还想打拳吗?
You still wanna box?

351
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,143
我知道我离开了很长时间。
Hey, I know I've been away a long time.

352
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:18,946
我保持身材。
I kept myself in shape.

353
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:21,716
我有一些你还没看过的动作。
I got some moves you ain't seen yet.

354
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:22,784
是的。你……
Yeah. You...

355
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,386
你看起来像柴油机。-我没开玩笑。
-You looking diesel. -I ain't joking.

356
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,388
我准备好了。
I'm ready.

357
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,825
我油箱里还有油。
I still got gas in the tank.

358
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,928
我得把链子拿回来。
And I gotta get me that chain.

359
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,231
"钻石"女爵不可能看起来闷闷不乐的。
Can't be "Diamond" Dame looking bummy.

360
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,400
“钻石”夫人。
"Diamond" Dame.

361
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:42,670
这是正确的。
That's right.

362
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,311
好吧。
All right.

363
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,346
来健身房吧。
Come by the gym.

364
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:55,315
帮你介绍杜克。
Get you set up with Duke.

365
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,988
——真的吗?-是的。
-For real? -Yeah.

366
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,624
为真实的。
For real.

367
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:06,761
那好吧。
All right, then.

368
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:10,665
谢谢你！
Thank you.

369
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,819
哟，哟，哟!
Yo, yo, yo!

370
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,865
有什么好笑的?
What's so funny?

371
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:46,466
哦,没什么。我只是想说服你妈妈和我们一起住
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to convince your mama to come live with us,

372
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,836
这样我就可以有自己的同居编发器了
so I can have my own live-in braider.

373
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,208
是的。小心你的愿望。
Yeah. Careful what you wish for.

374
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,877
哦，我不担心。
Oh, I'm not worried.

375
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,714
这其实是个不错的主意。
It's actually not a bad idea.

376
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:02,049
你感觉怎么样，妈妈?你好吗?
And how you feeling, Mama? You good?

377
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,218
我很好。
I'm good.

378
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,520
-你确定?-是啊。
- You sure? - Oh, yeah.

379
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:07,955
好的。
Okay.

380
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:10,925
如果我儿子能准时来吃晚饭我会更好。
I'd be better if my son showed up on time for dinner.

381
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,395
哎哟。呃,抱歉。
Ouch. Uh, sorry.

382
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,164
-嗯。-我只是被困住了。
-Mmm. -I just got caught up.

383
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,232
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

384
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,570
在那里。看看那个。
There. Look at that.

385
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,491
谁是这个家真正的冠军?
Who's the real champ in this family?

386
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:30,619
你。
You are.

387
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,371
不。你。
No. You.

388
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,039
自己去看看吧。
Go see for yourself.

389
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,836
谢谢奶奶。我爱你。
Thank you Grandma. I love you.

390
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:39,878
不客气
You're welcome.

391
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,255
我爱你。
I love you.

392
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:42,339
嘿。
Hey.

393
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:43,966
没有电视。
No TV.

394
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,304
很好。我爱你。
Fine. I love you.

395
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:53,534
那你可要忙不过来了。
You're gonna have your hands full with that one.

396
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,736
我们已经这么做了。
We already do.

397
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,806
-不。她是最棒的。是的，我们有。
-No. She's the best. -Yes, we do.

398
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:00,508
她是。
She is.

399
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,209
-你是最糟糕的。-拜托，妈妈。
-You're the worst. -Oh, come on, Mama.

400
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,812
-你最差劲了。——停止……你不是认真的。
- You're the worst. - Stop... You don't mean it.

401
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,214
在这儿,马。-谢谢。
-Here, Ma. -Thank you.

402
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:09,850
B，你觉得这是个好主意吗?
B, think that's a good idea?

403
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,519
宝贝，今晚不行。
Baby, not tonight.

404
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:12,887
但我们谈过这个。
But we talked about this.

405
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,122
-一次做一件事。——好的。
- One thing at a time. - Okay.

406
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:23,864
好的。我们今晚不谈这个，好吗?
Okay. We are not doing this this evening, okay?

407
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,900
这样我们就直了
And just so we're straight

408
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,236
每个人都知道，
and everybody knows,

409
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,838
我不会离开我的家。
I am not leaving my house.

410
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:32,940
理解吗?
Understood?

411
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,442
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

412
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,911
——好的。——好的。
- Okay. - Okay.

413
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:38,546
我真的很好。
And I really am fine.

414
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,481
我保证，我今晚不会再中风了。
I promise you, I am not gonna have another stroke tonight.

415
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:42,516
好吗?
Okay?

416
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,119
明晚吃。
Have it tomorrow night.

417
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,788
妈妈。这是……
Mom. That's...

418
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:48,990
这一点都不好笑。
That's not funny.

419
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:50,490
这有点好笑。
It's a little funny.

420
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:52,393
你在帮倒忙。
And you're not helping.

421
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:54,595
你知道我们很担心你。
You know that we're worried about you.

422
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:55,930
——就是这样。我们现在可以不谈了。-我…
-That's it. We can leave it now. -I...

423
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,932
在最后一个之后我们要小心。
And we wanna be careful after the last one.

424
00:24:58,432 --> 00:24:59,867
我很好。
I am fine.

425
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:01,635
好吗?
Okay?

426
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,474
但是你呢?
But what about you?

427
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,675
你怎么了?
What's up with you?

428
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,443
是的。你去哪儿了，D?
Yeah. Where were you, D?

429
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,346
刚遇到一个叫丹的人。
Just ran into this guy named Dame.

430
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:14,882
达米安。
Damian.

431
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:18,652
他是谁?
Who's he?

432
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,561
你跟我确认过了吗?这不是什么慈善。
Think you might've checked with me? This ain't no damn charity.

433
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,132
而且年纪比你大。
And homey older than you.

434
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:34,135
我只是想让他喘口气。我们不就是这么做的吗?
I'm just trying to give him a break. Isn't that what we do anyway?

435
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,670
不!这不是基督教青年会。
No! This ain't the YMCA.

436
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,139
看看周围，杜克。
Look around, Duke.

437
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:40,041
你看到有人排着队想和费里斯对打吗?
You see anybody lining up to get in the ring with Felix?

438
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,711
我想说的是，让他练吧。
All I'm saying is, let him spar.

439
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:47,048
菲利克斯马上要打架了，可我们一个尸体都没有。
Felix got a fight coming up, and we have zero bodies.

440
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:49,383
我是说，绝对没人想和费里斯对打。
I mean, absolutely nobody wants to get in the ring with Felix.

441
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,751
我知道你在干什么，唐尼。
I know what you doin', Donnie.

442
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,888
你不欠他什么。
You don't owe this dude shit.

443
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:56,525
什么都没有。
Nothing.

444
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,593
但我们还是来一场吧。
But let's spar.

445
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:01,595
我们开始吧。
Let's do it.

446
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,900
菲力克斯，菲力克斯。听好了。
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

447
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,536
阿多尼斯带人来跟你比试。
Adonis brought somebody in for you to spar.

448
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,038
嘿,嘿。哇，哇，哇。
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

449
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,841
嗯?——我们。
-Huh? -We on.

450
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,882
这里有很多小猫咪。
Lot of young cats in here.

451
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,085
年轻人的游戏。
Young man's game.

452
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,054
别担心，杜克会照顾你的。
Don't worry, Duke's gonna take care of you.

453
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:30,691
我们回到原点。
We back to ground zero.

454
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,426
冠军总要有起点的，对吧?
Champs gotta start somewhere, right?

455
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,901
好吧。
All right.

456
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:45,072
菲利克斯，这是达米安。他会和你比武的。
Felix, meet Damian. He gonna spar with you.

457
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:47,576
你还记得怎么做吧?
You still remember how to do that, yeah?

458
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,112
你可以的。
You got this.

459
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:54,281
菲利克斯，集中精神。把握好时机。这就是我们所需要的。
Felix, stay focused. Work on timing. That's all we need.

460
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:14,510
这孩子为什么要欺负她?
Why's this kid picking on her?

461
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,337
我只是问问。
Well, I'm just asking.

462
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,389
的迹象。
Sign.

463
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,475
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,601
我认为……
I think...

465
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,562
她可能是想引起别人的注意
She probably wants to get some attention -

466
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,399
那为什么有麻烦的是我女儿而不是她?
So why's my daughter in trouble and not her?

467
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,903
她不能保护自己吗?
She can't protect herself?

468
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,074
显然我们很担心阿玛拉。
Obviously we're concerned about Amara.

469
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,993
在这里感觉舒适很重要。
Feeling comfortable here is important.

470
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,078
当然。
Of course.

471
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:45,958
但我们知道吵架不是解决问题的办法。
But we understand fighting isn't the way to handle things.

472
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:49,604
嗯哼。听着，我们爱阿玛拉。
Mm-hmm. Look, we love Amara.

473
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:58,136
她是一个学业出色的孩子。
She's an academically exceptional child...

474
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,221
她是蓬勃发展。
She's thriving.

475
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,850
她只是……打架。
She just... fights.

476
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,622
你想教她怎么打架吗?这就是你的建议?
So, you wanna teach her how to fight? That's your advice?

477
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,990
我觉得在那样的聋人学校，我没必要这么做，
I didn't think I had to, at a deaf school like that,

478
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,359
-但也许我错了。——等待。
- but maybe I was wrong. - Wait.

479
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:16,463
"在那样的聋哑学校"是什么意思，好像他们不再是孩子了?
What does that mean, "at a deaf school like that," like they're not still kids?

480
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:17,998
你还指望什么，阿多尼斯?
I mean, what did you expect, Adonis?

481
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,767
那么她应该学会如何保护自己。
Then she should learn how to defend herself.

482
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,168
好吧，首先，我不是那个意思
Okay, first of all, I'm not saying that

483
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:22,803
她不应该知道如何保护自己。
she shouldn't know how to defend herself.

484
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,305
我只是说说这对我的意义
I'm just saying what that means to me

485
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:26,040
和它对你的意义不一样。
is different than what it means to you.

486
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:29,877
如果她在一个应该安全的地方，但她并不安全呢?
What if she's someplace she's supposed to be safe, and she's not?

487
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,712
她不知道如何保护自己。
She won't know how to protect herself.

488
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:33,847
这是怎么回事?
Where's that coming from?

489
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:37,686
没有。这是事实。
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

490
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:40,821
好的。
Okay.

491
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:42,823
另一个事实是，我认为，作为父母，
Another fact is that, I think, as parents,

492
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,158
这实际上是我们的责任
it's actually our responsibility

493
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:46,293
教她如何评估自己的情绪。
to teach her how to assess her emotions.

494
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:49,531
所以你想让阿玛拉，和这个恶霸牵手
So you want Amara, right, to hold hands with this bully

495
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,398
然后开始谈论她的感受?
and start talking about her feelings?

496
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:52,499
那不是真实的生活。
That's not real life.

497
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,068
好吧，你想让她怎么做?
Okay, what do you want her to do?

498
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,836
你想让她永远不跟任何人说她的感受吗?
You want her to never talk about her feelings to anyone?

499
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:00,642
连我们都不知道，她能做的只有打人吗?
Not even to us, and all she can do about them is to hit somebody?

500
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,644
听着，我知道你觉得那对你有用，
Look, I know that you think that that has worked for you,

501
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:04,546
但现在你没有出口了，
but now that you don't have an outlet anymore,

502
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:07,147
你应该考虑谈谈你的感受。
you should think about maybe talking about how you feel.

503
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,483
就算不是对我，也要对别人。
If not to me, to somebody.

504
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:11,285
或者，我不知道，d，培养一个爱好。
Or, I don't know, D. Get a hobby.

505
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:14,021
-好吧，我去找个爱好。-哦,是么?
-Okay, I'll get a hobby. -Oh, yeah?

506
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,823
是的,你。
Yeah, you.

507
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:18,192
我要去演播室了。我要开始跟你合作了。
I'ma go down to the studio. I'ma start laying tracks with you.

508
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:20,828
这一点都不好笑，D。
That's not funny, D.

509
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:24,164
我知道你觉得你是在保护她，宝贝，
Look, I know that you think that you are protecting her, baby,

510
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:27,901
但她必须知道她为什么想打架，而不仅仅是怎么打。
but she has got to know why she wants to fight, not just how to do it.

511
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:30,672
解决所有问题的唯一办法不是打脸。
And the only solution to every problem is not a punch in the face.

512
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,773
是的，你说得对。有时确实如此。
Yeah, you're right. And sometimes it is.

513
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,547
好吧，我们好好玩吧。
All right, let's just have a good time.

514
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,851
好吧，看来你没事了。
Okay, I see you made it all right.

515
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:46,755
哦,是的。我只是问他:“布莱克一家住在哪里?”
Oh, yeah. I just asked him, "Where the Black family live at?"

516
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:49,957
-我在开玩笑。-是的。
-I'm kidding. -Yeah.

517
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,358
-怎么了，伙计?——“吃晚饭吗?
-What's up, man? -'Sup?

518
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,260
周围还有其他的。
There's other ones around.

519
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:55,129
我一个都没看见。给你。
I ain't see none. Here you go.

520
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:56,297
谢谢你！
Thank you.

521
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,198
-很高兴见到你，Bianca女士。快乐。
-Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca. -Pleasure.

522
00:29:58,232 --> 00:30:00,568
-你从没给我买过花。-你想要一个吻吗?
-You never bought me no flowers. -What, you want a kiss?

523
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:03,404
不。我很好。不，不，没关系。头里。
-Nah. I'm okay. No, no, it's all right. -Come here.

524
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,906
-嘿，你们家真漂亮。- -谢谢。
- Hey, y'all got a beautiful home. -  -Thank you.

525
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,809
嘿…吃晚饭的时间了。
Hey... dinner time.

526
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:10,911
你们有透明地板吗?
You got the see-through floors?

527
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,581
哦。
Oh.

528
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:16,984
哇。好吧。
Whoa. All right.

529
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,119
阿玛拉。
Amara.

530
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:21,756
——阿玛拉?——嗯。
- Amara? - Mm-hmm.

531
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,794
见到你很高兴见到你很高兴
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

532
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:29,430
见到你很高兴
Nice to meet you.

533
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,567
她说:“你也是。”
She says, "You too."

534
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,601
啊，当然。需要水吗?
Ah, hell yeah. Need water?

535
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:40,709
再次感谢。
Thank you again.

536
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,112
兄弟，我还是无法释怀。非常感谢。
Dawg, I still can't get over this. Thank you very much.

537
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,682
这个广场让他有了一整栋豪宅。
This square got him a whole mansion.

538
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:50,652
嫁给了一个真正的摇滚明星。
Married a-- a genuine rock star.

539
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:52,152
-是的，我说了。-嗯。
-Yeah, I did. -Mmm.

540
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:55,189
你有几张金唱片?
How many gold records you got?

541
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:57,124
-我有一些。-她很谦虚。
- I have a few. - She bein' modest.

542
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,126
她真的很谦虚。
She bein' real modest.

543
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,863
没有，但大部分都是我创作的艺人，不过，我也有一些。
No, but it's mostly artists I produce, but, yeah, I got some.

544
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,265
-她是制片人?她所做的事。
-And she produces? -She does.

545
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,536
唐尼。你在打卡。
Donnie. You punching up.

546
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,372
制片人女士，你下一场演出是什么时候?
So, Ms. Producer, when's your next show?

547
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:14,007
我最近都不怎么像那样表演了。
I don't really perform like that these days.

548
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,210
是啊，我休息了一下，因为我…
Yeah, I took a break, 'cause I was...

549
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:19,012
我在舞台上的听力有点问题。
I was having some issues with my hearing on stage.

550
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,716
现在我试着小心翼翼地保存我剩下的东西，
Now I'm trying to be careful and preserve what I've got left,

551
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,184
所以，我在制作。
so, I'm producing.

552
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,954
是的。
Yeah.

553
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,656
短期内不会。
Not any time soon.

554
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:33,695
不过还是很难放弃那个角色。对吧?
Still hard to give that part up, though. Right?

555
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:37,398
是的。这不是我唯一喜欢的事情，但这需要努力。
Yeah. It's not the only thing I love, but it takes work.

556
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:38,999
这是一种调整……——嗯。
It's an adjustment... - Mm-hmm.

557
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:40,167
.．.为了我们俩。
...for the both of us.

558
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,237
你们认识多久了?
So, how long have you known each other?

559
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,707
-我是说…-我们回去了。回来的路上。
- I mean... - We go back. Way back.

560
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,844
我们就像……我们就像兄弟一样。
We was like... We was like brothers.

561
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:51,780
在杰夫酒店住了两年。
Shared a room for two years at the Jeff.

562
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,215
是的，差不多是这样。
Yeah, something like that.

563
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,519
你知道是怎么回事。他去了好莱坞。
You know how it went. He went off and got all Hollywood.

564
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:58,853
杰夫，对。
The Jeff, right.

565
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:00,187
对，教养院。
Yeah, the group home.

566
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,390
你记得那些臭虫吗?
You remember them bedbugs?

567
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,728
我试着忘记他们。
I try to forget 'em.

568
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,896
是的。
Yeah.

569
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,633
我忘不了那些虫子。
I can't forget them bugs.

570
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,571
-我去哄她睡觉——好的。
- I'm gonna get her to bed. - Okay.

571
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:19,373
-你俩留下来叙叙旧——好的。
- You two stay, catch up. - Okay.

572
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,375
邀请他参加厂牌派对。
Oh, invite him to the label party.

573
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,710
-一定会的。-是的。
-Definitely will do that. -Yeah.

574
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:25,078
我听说了。我被邀请参加唱片公司的派对。
I heard that. I'm invited to the label party.

575
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:27,715
-你被邀请了。-谢谢。
- You're invited. - Thank you.

576
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,851
是的。非常感谢你能来。
Yeah. Thank you so much for coming.

577
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:33,420
-是的，毫无疑问。很高兴认识你。-嗯。
-Yeah, no doubt. My pleasure to meet you. -Mmm.

578
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:44,431
真不敢相信你搬回乡下来了。
I can't believe you moved back out here to the boonies.

579
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:46,901
你以前很喜欢来兜帽区现在你们都……
You used to love coming out to the hood. Now you all...

580
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,770
怎么啦？
What?

581
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:50,872
-驯养和狗屎。-拜托，伙计。
-Domesticated and shit. -Ah, come on, man.

582
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:53,140
-看看结婚后会发生什么。
- See what happens when you get married.

583
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:54,809
-好吧，兄弟。-Aight吗?
-Yeah, all right, bro. -Aight?

584
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,444
-女人负责这个家。-我只是住在这里。
- The women run this household. - I just live here.

585
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,683
就是这样，伙计。你结婚，组建家庭。
That's what happens, man. You get married, a family.

586
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:03,484
这太疯狂了。
It's crazy.

587
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,589
倒了。
Pour up.

588
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:21,970
真不敢相信你把它换成了猴装。
Can't believe you traded it in for a monkey suit.

589
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:26,975
你知道，西装还是有好处的。
Oh, you know, a suit has some advantages.

590
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:36,818
你说得好像我变软了似的
You saying that like I got soft or something, like...

591
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,820
-我这次偷袭失败了。-嘿，哇，哇，哇。
-Like I lost this sneak-attack. -Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

592
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,288
好的，我明白了。冠军还有点胆量。
Okay, I see. The champ's still got some pepper in him.

593
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:44,291
我想说的是，我离开了拳击，但拳击并没有离开我。
All I'm saying is, I left boxing, but boxing didn't leave me.

594
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,562
看，这就是我说的，兄弟。
See, that's what I'm saying, bro.

595
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:53,001
我是说，听着，我知道你有艘船要管理，
I mean, look, I know you got a ship to run, and whatnot,

596
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,268
但我没法把东西整理好
but I ain't keep my stuff together

597
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:56,203
就为了成为某个笨蛋的出气筒。
just to be some punching bag for some chump.

598
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:57,939
你懂我的意思吗?
You feel me?

599
00:33:57,972 --> 00:34:00,240
别在菲利克斯身上睡觉。Aight吗?
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

600
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,410
他吃了不少苦头。这是他应得的。
He got it the hard way. He earned it.

601
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,548
我辛辛苦苦坐了18年牢，兄弟。
I did 18 years the hard way, bro.

602
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,587
也许我没有说清楚。
Maybe I ain't make myself clear.

603
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:17,224
我想打冠军。
I want a title shot.

604
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:19,794
夫人……
Dame...

605
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:22,329
我不知道你怎么想，但事情不是这样的。
I don't know what you think, but it don't work like that.

606
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:25,165
菲利克斯这么冷漠，他又能失去什么?你会失去什么?
Felix so cold, what he got to lose? What you got to lose?

607
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:27,535
你以为我打个响指就能一夜之间让你成为竞争者吗?
You think I can snap my fingers and make you a contender overnight?

608
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:28,937
你不就是这样吗?
Ain't that what happened to you?

609
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:39,747
就像这样，兄弟。
It's like this, bro.

610
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,518
我尊重你……
I respect you...

611
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,722
但我的时间不多了。
but my clock tickin'.

612
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,190
对我来说，机不可失。
It's now or never for me.

613
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:52,961
我想帮你，我说过的。
And I wanna help you, like I said I would.

614
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,698
但是，伙计，你问我的，是…
But, man, what you asking me, it's...

615
00:34:58,566 --> 00:34:59,701
这有点不可能。
it's kinda impossible.

616
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,974
你不知道那是什么感觉，兄弟。
You don't know what it's like, bro.

617
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,210
穿着它们那么久……
All that time in them...

618
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,981
在墙里。
in them walls.

619
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:19,087
不可能吗?
Impossible?

620
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,057
他们取了你的名字。
They take your name.

621
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,392
题目给你一个数字。
And they give you a number.

622
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,296
事情就是这样开始的。
That's how it start.

623
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,801
不过，我是最棒的。
I was the best, though.

624
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:35,603
是的，你是。
Yeah, you were.

625
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:37,572
是的，兄弟。
I was, bro.

626
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:41,174
但我一直没机会证明这一点。
But I never got a chance to prove that.

627
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:45,212
我想说的是，兄弟，如果
Look, all I'm saying, bro, if--

628
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:49,817
如果阿波罗·奎迪能在不被看好的人身上试试…
If Apollo Creed could take a chance on some underdog...

629
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:52,654
你为什么不能?
why can't you?

630
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,801
你睡得好吗?
Did you sleep okay?

631
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,505
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

632
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,006
你在磨牙。
You were grinding your teeth.

633
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,144
昨晚过得怎么样?
How was the rest of last night?

634
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:18,680
毫米…
Mm...

635
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,749
-是，呃…这很好。-是吗?
-It was, uh... It was good. -Yeah?

636
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:22,984
只是在叙叙旧。
Just catching up.

637
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:27,387
你怎么从没跟我说过教养院的事?
Hey, why didn't you ever tell me about the group home?

638
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,960
没有什么可说的。
There wasn't a lot to say.

639
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,831
嗯。
Hmm.

640
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:38,966
那时你多大?
How old were you?

641
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:44,005
我和阿玛拉差不多大。
Uh, I was around Amara's age.

642
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,577
你不想谈谈吗?
You don't wanna talk about it?

643
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,180
没关系。
It's okay.

644
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,349
——没有。-没关系。
- No. - It's okay.

645
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,319
不，是Dame。
Nah, it's Dame.

646
00:37:00,822 --> 00:37:02,657
你知道他让我跟费里斯打吗?
You know he asked me to fight Felix?

647
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:05,993
-真的吗?-是的。
- For real? - Yeah.

648
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:09,063
世界重量级冠军，他想试一试。
Heavyweight champion of the world, and he wants a shot.

649
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:10,732
你说什么?
So what'd you say?

650
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,300
我说没有。
I said no.

651
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,469
这是不可能的，你知道吗?
It's impossible, you know?

652
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:17,538
人们一生都在等待这样的镜头。
People wait their whole lives for a shot like that.

653
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,173
-他甚至都不是专业的。-是的。
-And he's not even a pro. -Yeah.

654
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:23,778
为什么你看起来还在考虑呢?
Why does it look like you're still considering it?

655
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:30,250
正确的。好吧。把他推到绳子上。
Right. All right. Work him against the ropes.

656
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:33,286
他工作。站在他前面，宝贝。把戒指剪掉。来吧。
Work him. Stay in front of him, baby. Cut off that ring. Come on.

657
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,256
现钞。
Oof.

658
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:37,759
这是正确的。
That's right.

659
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,596
别看我，伙计。你自己去吧。我们走吧。
Don't look at me, man. You on your own in there. Let's go.

660
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:43,197
来吧，< i>mijo，</i>盯着他。
Come on, <i>mijo,</i> stay on him.

661
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,632
继续战斗。我们走吧。
Keep fighting. Let's go.

662
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:46,366
好的。
Okay.

663
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,037
好了，宝贝，来吧。来吧。
Okay, baby, come on. Come on.

664
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:51,072
好的。
Okay.

665
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,640
爷爷，我们走吧。
Let's go, grandpa.

666
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:54,709
不够的。
Not enough.

667
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,213
保持专注。戳,戳。
Stay focused. Jabs, jabs.

668
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,049
给他吧。
Give it to him.

669
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,051
自己练习握拳。我们开始吧。
Work yourself out the clinch. Let's do it.

670
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:07,955
-嘿!你保持干净，对吧?-那是什么?嘿。
-Hey! You keep it clean, huh? -What was that? Hey.

671
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:10,591
哟,老兄。你想干什么，伤害我吗?
Yo, man. What you trying to do, hurt me?

672
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:14,394
-走一走。小家伙，你不是那样的身材。-你叫谁"小男人"?
-Walk it off. Little man, you ain't built like that. -Who you calling "little man"?

673
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:15,563
这是我的健身房，兄弟。
This is my gym, bro.

674
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:16,731
好吧，兄弟。好吧!
All right, coz. All right!

675
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,298
进去吧。
Get in there.

676
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,299
嘿，嘿，嘿。
Hey, hey, hey.

677
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,770
不。退后，达米安。让他走吧。
Nah. Get back, Damian. Let him go.

678
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,739
嘿!这里发生了什么?
Hey! What's going on down here?

679
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:25,873
这是故意的。
That was intentional.

680
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:28,209
-你来处理。-我会处理的。
-You handle this. -I am gonna handle this.

681
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,744
D，跟我说话。发生了什么事?
D, talk to me. What happened?

682
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:30,812
我在做我的工作。
Me doing my job.

683
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,647
嘿，过来，伙计。
Hey, come here, man.

684
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,283
来吧。嘿，嘿，嘿。动动脑筋。好吗?
Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Use your head. Okay?

685
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,317
动动脑筋。把那些乱七八糟的东西留在外面。
Use your head. Leave all that other mess outside.

686
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,254
我告诉过你我想要什么，D。
I told you what I want, D.

687
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,990
我告诉过你这需要时间。
And I told you it was gonna take some time.

688
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,025
好吧。
All right.

689
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:46,994
好吧?去散散步。
All right? Go take a walk.

690
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:48,596
呼吸点新鲜空气。
Get some air.

691
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,131
Aight吗?
Aight?

692
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,767
嘿,阿多尼斯。
Hey, Adonis.

693
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,068
不嘿，杜克。冷静下来。
No-- Hey, Duke. Calm down.

694
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,503
-这是个错误。-我已经控制住了。
-This was a mistake. -I got it under control.

695
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:56,938
我一开始就告诉你这是个错误。
I told you right away it was a mistake.

696
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,940
-我知道了。-你不!
-I got it. -You don't!

697
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:01,142
你让他带着怒气进来。
You let him come in here with a chip on his shoulder.

698
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,442
这就是……
That's exactly...

699
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,645
-好吧，现在别安静，Dukie。男人……
-Well, don't get quiet now, Dukie. -Man...

700
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:09,317
没关系。放松。我知道，我懂你。我知道。就让它过去吧。好吗?
It's okay. Relax. I know, I got you. I know. Just let it go. Okay?

701
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,452
我已经控制住了。
I got it under control.

702
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:15,623
他在告诉你他是谁，对吧?
He's telling you who he is, right?

703
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,225
相信他。
Believe him.

704
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,265
你在干什么，流氓?
What you up to, rascal?

705
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,392
哦，我……
Oh, I was...

706
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,936
我在打扫卫生。
I was cleaning.

707
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,147
杜克叔叔可不是这么跟我说的……
That's not what Uncle Duke told me...

708
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,028
我不想惹上麻烦。
I don't want to get in trouble.

709
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,781
妈妈不想让我打架。
Mom doesn't want me to fight.

710
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,996
就当我们的小秘密吧。
How 'bout it's our little secret.

711
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,997
是的!
Yes!

712
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,457
要我给你看看其他的东西吗?
Want me to show you all the other stuff?

713
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,500
是的!
Yes!

714
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,508
这叫右直拳。
That's called a straight right.

715
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,178
你就是这样打倒维勒的?
That's how you knocked out Wheeler?

716
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,346
谁教你的?
Who taught you that?

717
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:13,557
你。
You.

718
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,851
你看了那场比赛?
You watched that fight?

719
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:22,024
我看过你所有的比赛。
I've watched all your fights.

720
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,861
给我看点别的。
Show me something else.

721
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:31,992
大多数人认为这是关于暴力，但事实并非如此。
Most people think it's about violence but it's not.

722
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,578
时机和专注还有…
It's timing and focus and...

723
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,163
控制?
Control?

724
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,271
完美的。
Perfect.

-你看起来不错。你知道。你也一样。

嘿，别担心他们。
Hey, don't worry about them.

746
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,505
我不是。
I ain't.

747
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,507
这是一个聚会。玩得开心。
It's a party. Have fun.

748
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,875
这里还有很多东西你应该看看。
So many other things in here you should be looking at.

749
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,413
这是一场火灾派对，兄弟。是的。

750
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:35,049
恭喜,男孩。

查维斯，德拉戈。

我要确保这是今年最精彩的比赛。

754
00:43:44,992 --> 00:43:46,160
嘿，你没事吧?
Hey, you okay?

755
00:43:48,062 --> 00:43:49,396
我不需要保姆，兄弟。
I don't need no babysitting, bro.

756
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:51,932
Aight。我马上就回来。

看看我的两个杀手。
Look at my two killers.

759
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:57,938
我等不及要买这东西了…
I can't wait to get this thing...

760
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,110
你准备好了吗?
Are you ready to do this?

761
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:04,912
你知道我随时准备着。你不必问。
You know I'm always ready. You don't have to ask.

762
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:06,647
好的。留到战斗之夜再说吧。
Okay. Save it for fight night.

763
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,217
我们找到了地点。我们拿到钱了。我们要打破纪录了。
We got the venue. We got the money. We're gonna break records.

764
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:12,119
你能把音轨发给我吗?

是的。-谢谢你能来。

00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,196
你玩得开心吗?

-是的。改善情况。我也是。
-Yeah. -Good. Me too.

773
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,335
我厌倦了在房间里工作，但是…
I'm tired of working the room, but...

774
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:29,737
这就是你要做的。
It's what you do.

775
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,606
是的,有时候。
Yeah, sometimes.

776
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,608
-看来你们都是这么做的。-看那边的他。
- Guess that's what y'all do. - Look at him over there.

777
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,075
让他的唐·金上台。
Getting his Don King on.

778
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:36,777
除去头发。
Minus the hair.

779
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,345
-感谢上帝。-是的。
- Thank God. - Yeah.

780
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:39,680
你知道，这对他来说是成长。
You know, that's growth for him.

781
00:44:39,713 --> 00:44:41,616
他以前不喜欢参加这种活动。
He used to hate coming to these things.

782
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:43,951
所以…
So...

783
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,321
-感觉如何?——这是什么?
-How does it feel? -What's that?

784
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,956
让别人唱你的歌?
Having somebody else sing your song?

785
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:49,990
嗯。
Mmm.

786
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,693
感觉很好。
It feels good.

787
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:55,564
我是说，如果非要选个人的话，还不错。
I mean, if it's gotta be anybody, not bad.

788
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,098
是的，我几乎相信你了。
Yeah, I almost believe you.

789
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:03,370
唐尼怎么样?你觉得他想念拳击吗?
How about Donnie? Think he misses boxing?

790
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:06,040
不。他不是这么说的。
No. Not that he tells me.

791
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:08,677
但他会吗?
But would he?

792
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:15,716
说到这个，其实我有件事想问你。
Speaking of, you know, there's something I wanted to ask you actually.

793
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:18,852
我很好奇你们俩发生了什么。
Curious what happened with you two.

794
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:21,956
你想知道我是怎么被关起来的吗。
Oh, you wanna know how I got locked up.

795
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,625
是的。
Yeah.

796
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:24,959
真是无聊的故事。
Boring story really.

797
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,427
打了一架。
Got into a fight.

798
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:29,263
我有一些前科。
I had a few priors.

799
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:31,332
拔出了枪。
Pulled a gun.

800
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,636
唐尼在那里。他可以告诉你。
Donnie was there. He can tell you.

801
00:45:34,669 --> 00:45:36,036
你知道的。
You know.

802
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,505
唐尼走了…
Donnie pop off...

803
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:42,611
我不是说这家伙不配，但是…
And I ain't even saying dude ain't deserve it, but...

804
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,579
谁是"dude"?
Who is "dude"?

805
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:51,952
好的。嗯…
Okay. Uh...

806
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:54,855
他的名字叫里昂。
His name was Leon.

807
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:58,693
剩下的，我们让唐尼来告诉你。
The rest of it, we gonna leave to Donnie to tell you.

808
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,563
这不关我的事。感觉我吗?
Ain't really my place. Feel me?

809
00:46:03,698 --> 00:46:04,865
但就像你说的。
But it's like you say.

810
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:07,234
你知道，回顾过去是需要努力的。
You know, it take work to look at the past.

811
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:08,936
-喂，拦住他。——德拉戈!
- Yo, stop him. - Drago!

812
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,539
嘿，嘿，抓住那个家伙!
Hey, hey, get that guy!

813
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:19,246
<i>洛杉矶警方逮捕了这个人，</i> <i>Luis Camino
<i>The LAPD took this man,</i> <i>Luis Camino, into custody...</i>

814
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,181
不。
No.

815
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:23,551
不，我们不会取消任何活动。
No, we're not canceling anything.

816
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:25,085
他现在正在看专科医生。
He's seeing a specialist right now.

817
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,390
他们说……至少六个月。
They're saying... at least six months.

818
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:31,292
我知道。我知道。但我们会想办法的。
I know. I know. But we'll figure it out.

819
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:32,793
不要更改日期。
Do not move the date.

820
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:34,696
好吧。好吧。再见。
All right. All right. Bye.

821
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:36,096
<我>…备受瞩目的事件。< / i >
<i>...high-profile event.</i>

822
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,733
<i>Drago，谁目前</i> <i>在Cedars-Sinai康复，</i>
<i>Drago, who's currently</i> <i>recovering at Cedars-Sinai,</i>

823
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:40,467
<i>遭受了脑震荡，</i>

828
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:51,445

<i>-against Felix Chavez.</i> -Hello?

829
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,247
是的，一切都会好起来的。
Yes, everything is gonna be fine.

830
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,215
我们会想办法的。我们会找到另一个战士的。
We'll figure it out. We'll find another fighter.

831
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:57,585
这不仅仅是寻找另一个斗士。
It's not about just finding another fighter.

832
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:00,220
我知道，我也理解你的沮丧。真的。
I know, and I understand your frustrations. I really do.

833
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:01,422
那你打算怎么做?
So, what are you gonna do?

834
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,457
他想和德拉戈决斗。
He wants to fight Drago.

835
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,293
但我们不能等六个月等他洗脱罪名。
But we can't wait six months for him to be cleared.

836
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:09,930
这些窗户不会永远持续。我们现在就得给他钱。
These windows don't last forever. We need to get him paid now.

837
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:15,770
好吧，除了德拉戈还有一两个竞争者。
All right, there's one, maybe two other contenders outside of Drago.

838
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:17,905
有奥尔蒂斯，还有斯波利诺。
There's Ortiz, and then there's Sporino.

839
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,907
他刚刚从上次比赛中恢复过来。
And he's recovering from his last fight.

840
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,141
好吧，那是谁?
Okay, so then who?

841
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:29,784
我有个主意。
I got an idea.

842
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:33,822
这很冒险，但如果我们成功了，就能大赚一笔。
It's risky, but if we pull it off, it'll be a payday.

843
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:35,989
你有什么想法?
What do you have in mind?

844
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,324
他想让你去打Dame。
He wants you to fight Dame.

845
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,959
夫人呢?
Dame?

846
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:40,994
他甚至不是一个真正的战士。
He's not even a real fighter.

847
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:43,297
他跟你对打的时候很真实。
He was real enough when he was sparring with you.

848
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,632
菲利克斯，大家都在议论。
Hey, Felix, people talk.

849
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,801
冠军，他比你大。
Champ, he's older than you.

850
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:48,335
——嗯?-你说得对。
- Huh? - You're right.

851
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:51,438
但达姆会全力以赴。
But Dame will fight tooth and nail.

852
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:53,508
现在，我们得跳出思维定势。
Right now, we gotta think outside the box.

853
00:47:55,677 --> 00:47:57,111
哦，你不喜欢，是吗?
Oh, you don't like it, huh?

854
00:47:57,144 --> 00:47:58,680
达米安不是拳击手。
Damian ain't a boxer.

855
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:00,214
他在反抗这个世界，他在伤害别人。
He's fighting the world and he's trying to hurt people.

856
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:02,149
不，我不喜欢。我觉得会像马戏团一样。
No, I don't like it. I think it'd be a circus.

857
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:05,854
他的意思是他要表演一场。好吗?
What he means is he's gonna put on a show. Okay?

858
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:07,655
我们得打好手中的牌。
We gotta play the cards that we're dealt.

859
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:10,391
但问题是，人们会来吗?
But the thing here is, will people come?

860
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:13,561
哦，人们会来的。我可以向你保证。
Oh, people are gonna show up. I can promise you that.

861
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:16,463
每个人都喜欢弱者的故事。
Everyone loves an underdog story.

862
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:20,802
你知道阿波罗给洛奇注射的时候有多少人收看了吗?
You know how many people tuned in when Apollo gave Rocky a shot?

863
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:23,437
人们今天还在谈论那场比赛。
People are still talking about that fight today.

864
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:26,039
冠军,听着。
Champ, listen.

865
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:29,376
我知道这不是我们承诺的，好吗?我明白了。
I know it's not what we promised, okay? I understand.

866
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,946
但如果是我，我会这么做。
But if it was me, I'd do it.

867
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:36,917
你怎么看?
What do you think?

868
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,294
你信任他吗?
Do you trust him?

869
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,380
是的，当然。
Yes, of course.

870
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:43,549
好的，我们开始吧。
Ok so let's go.

871
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:45,794
我们开始吧。
Let's do it.

872
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:47,662
让你儿子知道
Just let your boy know,

873
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:49,430
我要在拳台上打败他。
I'ma beat his ass when I'm in that ring.

874
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:53,267
费里斯，我只想让你做好你的工作。
Felix, all I want you to do is your job.

875
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:56,370
嗯?-我们去拿吧。
-Hmm? -Let's get it.

00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:26,781
查韦斯已经开始反击了。
and Chavez is already back on the attack.

1015
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:30,384
好了，冠军。
There we go, champ.

1016
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:32,687
感觉查韦斯又回来战斗了。
Feels like Chavez is back in the fight.

1017

《妈妈咪呀!》

00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:46,834
安德森挥臂将查韦斯的头和肩膀分开。

1019
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:53,274
嘿!嘿，嘿，嘿!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1020
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:55,977
——哟!这是什么?-哇，看起来是故意的。
- Yo! What is this? - Wow, that looked deliberate.

1021
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,244
——你!时间!-裁判需要
- You! Time! - The ref needs

1022
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:59,113
在事态失控之前控制住局面。
to get control before this gets out of hand.

1023
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:00,948
-你能继续吗?-是的，我很好。我们走吧。
-Can you continue? -Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

1024
00:58:00,982 --> 00:58:03,117
-待在这里。- -对查韦斯来说唯一的好消息就是
- Stay right here. -  -The only good news for Chavez is that

1025
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,386
-伤口在他眼睛下面太远了…头里。
-that cut is so far below his eye... -Come here.

1026
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:07,888
-…但这仍然很危险。两点扣除。故意肘。
-...but it's still dangerous. -Two-point deduction. Intentional elbow.

1027
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:08,990
裁判，是时候了。
It's about time, ref.

1028
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,359
两点扣除。故意肘。
Two-point deduction. Intentional elbow.

1029
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:14,095
听着，你再这样下去会被取消资格的。
Listen, you keep this up and you're gonna get yourself disqualified.

1030
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:15,596
-你明白吗?-对。正确的。
-Do you understand? -Right. Right.

1031
00:58:15,629 --> 00:58:16,831
待在那儿别动。
Stay right there.

1032
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:18,833
你好吗?-是的，我很好。
-You good? -Yeah, I'm good.

1033
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,267
如果有人想知道……——盒子!
If anyone was wondering... - Box!

1034
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:22,737
.．.这是一场什么样的战斗，
...what kind of fight this would be,

1035
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,273
安德森似乎想把这一点说清楚:
it seems like Anderson is out to make this clear:

1036
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:29,777
这是一场生死之战。
This is a fight for your life.

1037
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,748
让我们希望查韦斯能回到他的角落，并做出调整。
Let's hope Chavez can make it back to his corner and adjust.

1038
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:35,916
一记右拳，结束比赛
Big right hand to end the round

1039
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,121
和查韦斯送安德森到角落思考的东西。
and Chavez sends Anderson to the corner with something to think about.

1040
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:42,223
做得好。坚强的结束方式。
Way to finish. Way to finish strong.

1041
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:48,396
我去拿话筒。
Let me get that mouthpiece.

1042
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:56,203
继续努力，冠军。一轮又一轮。
Keep grinding, champ. Round after round.

1043
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:04,211
嘿,冠军。你好吗?你还能去吗?
Hey, champ. You good? Can you still go?

1044
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,380
是的，我很好。
Yeah, I'm good.

1045
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:07,748
好吧，他很好。我们走吧。
Okay, he's good. Let's go.

1046
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,184
他说他很好。
He said he's good.

1047
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,954
听着，痛苦是暂时的。
Listen, pain is temporary.

1048
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:16,157
-再说一遍。痛苦是暂时的。-痛苦是暂时的。
-Say it back to me. Pain is temporary. -Pain is temporary.

1049
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,959
他是个流浪汉!好吧?你是冠军，对吗?
He a bum! Okay? And you the champ, right?

1050
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:20,494
我是冠军。
I'm the champ.

1051
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:22,096
我们走吧，冠军。把手举起来。离绳子远点。
Let's go, champ. Keep your hands up. Stay off them ropes.

1052
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:27,835
把它带进来。
Bring it in.

1053
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:30,304
-很好。我们走吧。<我>我们。</i> -来吧。
- That's good. Let's go. <i>Vamos.</i> - Come on.

1054
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:31,839
两轮下来，
Two rounds down,

1055
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:35,076
但这显然不是我们想象中的战斗。
but it's clearly not the fight any of us expected.

1056
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:37,044
待在里面，<i>mijo.</i>
Stay in it, <i>mijo.</i>

1057
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:38,679
左臂又中了一枪。
Another shot to that left arm.

1058
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,685
事情开始变得很糟糕了。
Things are starting to get very ugly.

1059
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:47,188
-查韦斯有大麻烦了。-解放双手。停!
- Chavez is in some serious trouble. - Hands free. Stop!

1060
00:59:47,221 --> 00:59:50,024
-我得带她去，D，好吗?-好的。
-I gotta take her, D, okay? -Okay.

1061
00:59:50,057 --> 00:59:52,159
没有失败这回事。我们走吧。我们得走了。
There's no such thing as defeat. Let's go. We gotta go.

1062
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:53,427
这很危险。
This is dangerous.

1063
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:55,062
安德森像破坏球一样摇摆不定……
Anderson swinging like a wrecking ball...

1064
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:57,398
让让。动!-…查韦斯正在被摧毁。
-Move. Move! -...and Chavez is getting demolished.

1065
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,112
哦，安德森投得真漂亮。查韦斯下台了。
Oh, what a shot by Anderson. Down goes Chavez.

1066
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:14,516
<i>Chavez is not get back up.</i> .
<i>Chavez is not getting back up.</i>

1067
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:17,017
哦,不。你不会想看到的。
Oh, no. You don't wanna see that.

1068
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:18,452
查韦斯下台了
Chavez is down

1069
01:00:18,486 --> 01:00:21,355
而且似乎受了重伤。不，不，不。
-and appears to be badly hurt. -No, no, no.

1070
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:23,023
费利克斯!
Felix!

1071
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:24,992
女士们，先生们……
Ladies and gentlemen...

1072
01:00:25,025 --> 01:00:26,694
——<我> ?帕索?</i> -…我们的裁判，
- <i>?Que paso?</i> - ...our referee in charge,

1073
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:29,063
-拉塞尔·莫拉停止比赛。-叫急救人员!
- Russell Mora, stops the contest. -  -Call the paramedics!

1074
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,632
他是赢家……-医生，他会没事吧?
He is the winner... - Doc, is he gonna be okay?

1075
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:33,267
.．.通过惊人的击倒
...by way of spectacular knockout

1076
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,572
他是新的世界重量级联合冠军，
and he is the new unified heavyweight champion of the world,

1077
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:41,543
“钻石”达米安·安德森。
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

1078
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:44,945
“吃晚饭,兄弟?“吃晚饭,兄弟?
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?

1079
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,815
对吧?怎么啦？
Right? What?

1080
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:22,316
好吧，杜克。我们得弥补这一切。
All right, Duke. We gotta make this right.

1081
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,451
-无论我能做什么…-不。我已经告诉过你了，兄弟。
-Whatever I can do... -No. I told you, dawg, already.

1082
01:01:24,485 --> 01:01:26,621
没有什么是正确的。什么"公爵"都没有。
Ain't no making nothing right. Ain't no "Duke" nothing.

1083
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,122
-我能修好。-不!
-I can fix it. -No!

1084
01:01:28,155 --> 01:01:29,924
你不能。
You can't.

1085
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:33,194
你离健身房远点，你做到了。离开一段时间。
You stay away from the gym. You do that. And stay away for a while.

1086
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,491
嘿,妈妈。
Hey, Ma.

1087
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:05,893
Felix怎么样?
How's Felix?

1088
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:09,598
他还在医院
He's still at the hospital.

1089
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,600
他是稳定的。
He's stable.

1090
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,503
我想我应该离开那里，给他一些空间。
I figured I'd get out of there and give him some space.

1091
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:16,770
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

1092
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:18,540
也许很聪明。
May be smart.

1093
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:25,346
这是什么?
What's all this?

1094
01:02:28,617 --> 01:02:29,718
是达米安送的。
They're from Damian.

1095
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:46,333
你瞒着我?
You kept these from me?

1096
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,369
帮你向前看，是的。
To help you move on, yes, I did.

1097
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:54,775
妈妈，你怎么能这样?
Mama, how could you?

1098
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:58,879
我是想保护你。
I was trying to protect you.

1099
01:02:58,912 --> 01:03:00,414
保护我免受什么伤害?
Protect me from what?

1100
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,349
达米安是我哥哥。
Damian was my brother.

1101
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:03,917
不,唐尼。
No, Donnie.

1102
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:06,721
不是在那个你像动物一样被关在笼子里的地方。
Not in that facility where you were caged like an animal.

1103
01:03:06,755 --> 01:03:09,123
你以为我会让你重蹈覆辙吗?
Did you think that I was gonna let you go back to that?

1104
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:11,959
你让他以为我抛弃了他。
You made him think I abandoned him.

1105
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:15,129
你知道我们经历了什么吗?
Do you know what we went through?

1106
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:17,264
我知道你们俩打的那个人是谁。
I know who that man was the two of you beat up.

1107
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,334
你认识里昂吗?
You know Leon?

1108
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:28,375
是的。
Yeah.

1109
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:32,246
那你应该知道达米安在你知道我是谁之前就支持过我。
Then you know Damian had my back before you even knew who I was.

1110
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:34,649
Dame对我比对你的两个孩子更像家人
Dame treated me more like family than your two kids

1111
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:35,750
从来没有在这房子里做过。
ever did in this house.

1112
01:03:35,784 --> 01:03:37,652
而你却夺走了我的一切。
And you took that away from me.

1113
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:39,788
如果不是你，这一切都不会发生。
None of this would've happened if it wasn't for you.

1114
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:44,425
你说得完全正确。
You're absolutely right.

1115
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:48,162
都不是。
None of it.

1116
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:51,465
你打得太狠了，唐尼。
You hit hard, Donnie.

1117
01:03:52,534 --> 01:03:54,868
你看不见。
And you can't see.

1118
01:03:57,438 --> 01:03:59,973
也许达米安曾经支持过你。
There may have been a time when Damian had your back.

1119
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:04,612
但他现在不是这么做的。
But that's not what he's doing now.

1120
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:39,880
原谅我。
Excuse me.

1121
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:42,449
哟,夫人。爵士。
Yo, Dame. Dame.

1122
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:44,519
-嘿,老兄。把你的手拿开。
-Hey, man. -Get your hands off me.

1123
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,186
把你的手拿开!
Get your hands off me!

1124
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:48,355
举起。
Hold up.

1125
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,559
aight。冷静点，兄弟。
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1126
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,061
给我。
Give me that.

1127
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,535
这就是我们要谈的?
That's what we on?

1128
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:04,739
怎么了，唐尼?你没事吧?你看起来很整洁，兄弟。
What's up, Donnie? You all right? You look tidy, bro.

1129
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:06,608
男人。不，不，你告诉我，兄弟。
Man. Nah, nah, you tell me, bro.

1130
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:10,043
你一直都在耍我。
You've been playing me this whole time.

1131
01:05:11,345 --> 01:05:13,180
看来你收到他们的信了?
Guess you did get them letters, huh?

1132
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:14,415
你为什么要骗我?
Why'd you lie to me?

1133
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:17,819
我为你担保过。
I vouched for you.

1134
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:20,354
是我带你来我家的，兄弟。你见过我的家人。
I brought you into my home, bro. You met my family.

1135
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:24,391
我为你存了钱。
I put money up for you.

1136
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:26,493
-按你说的戴上手套。-好的。这就够了。
-Put the gloves on your hands like you asked. -All right. That's enough.

1137
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:28,863
你懂我的意思吗?
You feel me?

1138
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,433
你给我戴上手套了吗?
You put the gloves on my hands?

1139
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,536
哦,家的。
Oh, homey.

1140
01:05:35,436 --> 01:05:36,738
你一定很有力。
You must be punchy.

1141
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:42,544
如果我没记错的话，你以前帮我拿手套。
'Cause if memory serves, you used to carry my gloves.

1142
01:05:42,577 --> 01:05:45,179
收拾好你的东西，滚出体育馆。
Get your shit and get out the gym.

1143
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:47,948
唐尼，等等。等等，等等，等等。
Oh, Donnie, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

1144
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:49,116
你以为我需要你?
You think I need you?

1145
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:53,420
不。我被关起来的时候，我需要你。
No. When I got locked up, I needed you.

1146
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:57,291
当我回家的时候，兄弟，我需要你。
When I came home, yeah, bro, I needed you.

1147
01:05:58,992 --> 01:06:00,427
但看看周围，兄弟。
But look around, bro.

1148
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:04,398
-我是冠军!——是的!
- I'm the champ! - Yeah!

1149
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:07,602
我不需要你做任何事或者…或什么都没有。
And I don't need you for nothing or... or nothing.

1150
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,272
现在谁孤身一人?
Who alone now?

1151
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:19,948
是的，没错。跑开了。
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1152
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,282
跑开了。这是你唯一擅长的事，
Run away. That's the one thing you still good at,

1153
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,885
婴儿的信条。
Baby Creed.

1154
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:30,357
那是什么?
What was that?

1155
01:06:31,693 --> 01:06:33,193
-你叫我什么?-你生气了?
-What'd you call me? -Oh, you mad?

1156
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:36,598
你疯了吗?
You mad?

1157
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:39,934
试试在牢房里度过半辈子吧
Try spending half your life in a cell

1158
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:42,135
看着别人过着你的生活。
watching somebody else live your life.

1159
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:45,707
你背叛了我，兄弟。
You turned your back on me, homey.

1160
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:50,344
嘿，听着，别绊倒了。
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1161
01:06:51,946 --> 01:06:53,515
嘿，过来。
Hey, come here.

1162
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:54,616
还记得这个吗?
Remember this?

1163
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:57,519
这个标题?
This title?

1164
01:06:57,552 --> 01:06:59,687
这一切?
All this?

1165
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:01,956
我才刚开始呢，弟弟。
Hey, I'm just getting started, little brother.

1166
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:04,993
我来全取。
I'm coming for it all.

1167
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:07,962
那是什么意思?
And what's that supposed to mean?

1168
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:10,163
你在威胁我吗?
Are you threatening me?

1169
01:07:16,403 --> 01:07:17,906
这里没有威胁，兄弟。
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1170
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:20,642
我保证，兄弟。
Just promises here, homey.

1171
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:24,478
到这里来。让我们来看看。
Come here. Let's see.

1172
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:25,980
把你的手拿开。-你还好吧。
-Get your hands off me. -Oh, you all right.

1173
01:07:30,818 --> 01:07:31,886
是的。
Yeah.

1174
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:34,221
请自己站起来。
Help yourself up for once.

1175
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:36,591
看看感觉如何。
See how it feel.

1176
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:54,609
阿罗哈!
Aloha!

1177
01:08:05,352 --> 01:08:06,621
你整晚都去哪儿了?
Where were you all night?

1178
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:12,459
你当时和今早都没接到我的电话?
You didn't get any of my calls then, or this morning?

1179
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:19,067
你的眼睛怎么了?
What happened to your eye?

1180
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,133
什么都没有。
Nothing.

1181
01:08:23,203 --> 01:08:24,606
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

1182
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:29,309
不是今天。我没时间去做心理治疗。
Not today.  I ain't got time for a therapy session.

1183
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,581
好的。那你还有时间干什么?
Okay. Well, then what do you have time for?

1184
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:35,516
让我知道。
Let me know.

1185
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,352
因为我已经试着和你谈谈很久了，唐尼。
Because I have been trying to talk to you for a really long time, Donnie.

1186
01:08:38,385 --> 01:08:39,587
好吧?
All right?

1187
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:43,625
求你了，你能告诉我发生了什么吗。
Please, can you tell me what is going on.

1188
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:46,060
是我吗?
Is it me?

1189
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,930
不。这与你无关。
No. It's nothing to do with you.

1190
01:08:57,105 --> 01:08:58,305
是关于里昂的吗?
Is it about Leon?

1191
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:02,844
怎么啦？谁告诉你的?
What? Who told you that?

1192
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,313
爵士。
Dame.

1193
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:10,183
你还有什么想告诉我的吗?
Is there something else you wanna tell me?

1194
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:16,758
小迪，你总得敞开心扉吧。
D, you have got to open up at some point.

1195
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,192
我不知道还能跟你说什么。我需要了解。
I don't know what else to tell you. I need to understand.

1196
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,495
你想让我说什么?你想听什么?
What do you want me to say? What do you wanna hear?

1197
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,930
一些悲伤的故事?
Some sad story?

1198
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:24,999
你是想同情我还是怎么的?
You're trying to feel sorry for me or something?

1199
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:27,234
我不想为你感到难过!我想了解你!
I don't wanna feel sorry for you! I wanna understand you!

1200
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:29,336
我想知道你在我家是怎么回事!
I wanna know what is going on with you in my house!

1201
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:32,472
没什么好谈的!我什么都不想说!
There's nothing to talk about! I don't wanna talk about anything!

1202
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:34,441
我一直在努力忘记它!
I've been trying to forget it!

1203
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:37,645
它死了!离开它!离开它!随它去吧!
It's dead! Leave it! Leave it! Let it lie!

1204
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,681
我再也不提那破事了。
I'm not talking about that shit no more.

1205
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:51,959
你自己想办法吧，D。
You figure out your shit, D.

1206
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:56,496
因为不能让她看到你这样。
Because what cannot happen is her seeing you like this.

1207
01:09:58,231 --> 01:09:59,567
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

1208
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,070
是的。
yeah.

1209
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,627
我爱你。
I love you.

1210
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,759
<i>嘿，你们在那里干什么</i> <i> ?< / i >
<i>Hey, what y'all doing</i> <i>in there?</i>

1211
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:00,528
夫人!阿多尼斯!
Dame! Adonis!

1212
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:02,395
——停止!-来吧!打击我!
- Stop! - Come on! Fight me!

1213
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:03,497
里昂，对不起!< / i >

你不记得我了，是吗?< / i >
<i>Don't remember me, do you?</i>

1217
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,426
嘿，放开他!
Hey, get off him!

1218
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,962
你知道是怎么回事，兄弟。
Yeah, you know what it is, homey.

1219
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:44,437
——夫人!-离枪远点。
- Dame! - Step away from the gun.

1220
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,107
-离枪远点。-下来。
-Step away from the gun. -It's down.

1221
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,175
这是失望!这是下来。
It's down! It's down.

1222
01:11:57,018 --> 01:11:59,086
-嗨，妈妈。<i>-阿多尼斯，宝贝。</i>
- Hey, Mama. <i>- Adonis, baby.</i>

1223
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,721
<i>你得马上过来
<i>You gotta get here right away.</i>

1224
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:03,090
<i>妈妈又中风了
<i>Mama had another stroke.</i>

1225
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:06,127
<i>题目说的是</i> <i>多器官衰竭</i>
<i>They're saying</i> <i>multiple organ failures.</i>

1226
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,996
<我>——我不知道,d . < / i > <我>——我认为这是…< / i >
<i>- I don't know, D.</i> <i>- I think it's...</i>

1227
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,265
<i>我想是时候说再见了</i> <i>
<i>I think it might be time</i> <i>to say goodbye.</i>

1228
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:15,468
妈妈?
Mama?

1229
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:21,175
妈妈，对不起。
Mom, I'm sorry.

1230
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:23,144
-什么?-我不是故意的。
-What? -I didn't mean it.

1231
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:25,580
我不是故意的。
I didn't mean it.

1232
01:12:25,613 --> 01:12:26,781
唔唔。
Mm-mmm.

1233
01:12:27,982 --> 01:12:30,551
我遇见你的那天。
The day I met you.

1234
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:34,155
哦，那张脸。
Ooh, that face.

1235
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:39,327
嗯。你当时很生气。
Mmm. You were so mad.

1236
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:45,432
要把所有人一个一个打晕。
Gonna knock everybody out, one by one.

1237
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,367
就像你父亲一样。
Just like your father.

1238
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:52,807
这就是他如此努力的原因。你知道的，对吧?
That's why he fought so hard. You know that, right?

1239
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:55,343
是的。
Yeah.

1240
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:59,347
但你，你不必这么做。
But you-- you don't have to do that.

1241
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:03,184
你可以找到另一种方法。
You can find another way.

1242
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,287
是的。
Yeah.

1243
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,157
是的，另一种方式。
Yeah, another way.

1244
01:13:11,092 --> 01:13:12,593
另一种方式。
Another way.

1245
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:15,462
我很生气。
I was angry.

1246
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:19,600
你离开我的时候我很生气，阿波罗。
I was so angry when you left me, Apollo.

1247
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:28,075
你为什么留下我一个人?
Why did you leave me alone?

1248
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:33,514
阿多尼斯。
Adonis.

1249
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:36,784
那是他的名字。
That's his name.

1250
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:39,020
我就在这里。
I'm right here.

1251
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:41,923
他救了我，阿波罗。
He saved me, Apollo.

1252
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:47,595
他帮助我原谅了你。
He helped me to forgive you.

1253
01:13:47,628 --> 01:13:49,597
妈妈，对不起。
Mom, I'm sorry.

1254
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:52,767
告诉我该怎么做。
Just tell me what to do.

1255
01:13:54,969 --> 01:13:57,038
好吗?
Okay?

1256
01:13:58,139 --> 01:13:59,941
阿多尼斯。
Adonis.

1257
01:14:02,043 --> 01:14:03,443
安东尼-
Adoni--

1258
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:36,470
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1259
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,574
我知道。
I know.

1260
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,478
没关系。
It's okay.

1261
01:15:44,513 --> 01:15:45,514
不，不是。
No, it's not.

1262
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:48,249
它只是…
It's just...

1263
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:50,584
当Dame回来的时候……
when Dame came back...

1264
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:57,191
所有这些都回来了。
all this shit came back too.

1265
01:15:58,225 --> 01:15:59,593
我不知道该怎么处理。
I didn't know how to handle it.

1266
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:03,164
但你一直都很擅长这个。
But you were always really good at that.

1267
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:05,900
感情这对你来说很容易。
Feelings. It comes easy to you.

1268
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:07,835
这对我来说不容易。
Doesn't come easy to me.

1269
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:10,237
不喜欢。
Doesn't.

1270
01:16:11,906 --> 01:16:14,909
我还有很多事情要弄清楚，
I still got a lot of stuff that I'm trying to figure out,

1271
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:18,179
我也不知道该怎么说
and I don't always know how to talk about it either.

1272
01:16:18,212 --> 01:16:19,980
你知道吗，玛丽·安妮是我最亲近的人
You know, Mary-Anne was the closest thing

1273
01:16:20,014 --> 01:16:22,149
我已经当了很久的妈妈了。
I've had to a mom in a really long time.

1274
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:23,552
我可以和她谈谈。
I could talk to her.

1275
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:25,386
现在她走了。
Now she's gone.

1276
01:16:28,456 --> 01:16:32,860
当我停止表演时，真的很难接受
And when I stopped performing, it was really hard to accept

1277
01:16:32,893 --> 01:16:36,130
我的梦想并没有像我想象的那样。
that my dreams didn't turn out the way that I imagined that they would.

1278
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:40,201
这让我很伤心。
And that still hurts me.

1279
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:43,404
很多。
A lot.

1280
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:49,578
但我只是做了一个选择，试着开始新的生活
But I just made a choice to try to move on

1281
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,580
为我所拥有的感到高兴。
and be happy about what I do have.

1282
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,452
但这并不容易。
But it's not easy.

1283
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:03,224
我只是努力。
I just try.

1284
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:20,074
利昂…
Leon...

1285
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,145
孩子爸爸在教养院吗
was the dad at the group home

1286
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:26,847
我和黛姆住在一起。
where I lived with Dame.

1287
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:32,920
我不是说我和黛姆是天使。
I'm not saying me and Dame were angels.

1288
01:17:34,623 --> 01:17:36,757
好吧?但是…
Okay? But...

1289
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:39,827
没有孩子应该像我们一样被打。
no kid deserves to get beat on like we did.

1290
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:41,929
你懂我的意思吗?
You feel me?

1291
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:47,101
那晚在卖酒的店里，我看到了里昂。
That night at the liquor store, I saw Leon.

1292
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:52,273
我崩溃了。
And I snapped.

1293
01:17:56,545 --> 01:17:57,878
我打了他。
And I hit him.

1294
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:02,049
我不停地打他。
I kept hitting him.

1295
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,354
他的孩子们扑向我。
And his boys jumped on me.

1296
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:10,891
所以黛姆拔出了枪。
So Dame pulled a gun.

1297
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:13,662
警察来了。
Cops pulled up.

1298
01:18:14,895 --> 01:18:16,163
我们试着逃跑。
We tried to run.

1299
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:20,000
Dame被抓了。我逃走了。
Dame got caught. I got away.

1300
01:18:23,137 --> 01:18:24,471
我跑。
I ran.

1301
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:27,174
你还是个孩子。
You were a kid.

1302
01:18:28,809 --> 01:18:32,213
你很害怕。任何人都会逃跑的。
You were scared. Anybody would've run.

1303
01:18:32,246 --> 01:18:35,316
丹姆有枪，阿多尼斯。这不是你的责任。
And Dame had a gun, Adonis. That's not on you.

1304
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:37,751
是的，但他倒下的时候，我没有联系他。
Yeah, but when he went down, I didn't reach out.

1305
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:41,188
我从没打过电话。
I never called.

1306
01:18:41,855 --> 01:18:43,090
我没有写。
I didn't write.

1307
01:18:46,427 --> 01:18:51,666
过了一段时间，我觉得假装忘记比较容易。
After a while, it felt easier to pretend like I forgot.

1308
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:53,934
你知道，就是…
You know, just...

1309
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:57,572
假装什么都没发生过。
act like it never happened.

1310
01:18:57,606 --> 01:19:00,841
但这并不意味着你要为他的人生负责。
But that doesn't make you responsible for how his life turned out.

1311
01:19:04,044 --> 01:19:06,514
你是个好人，阿多尼斯。
You are a good man, Adonis.

1312
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:09,483
我也不知道了。
I don't know anymore.

1313
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,653
你得试着原谅自己，
You have got to try to forgive yourself,

1314
01:19:11,686 --> 01:19:16,423
这样你就可以开始相信你值得拥有你所赢得的生活。
so that you can begin to believe that you deserve the life that you have earned.

1315
01:19:18,092 --> 01:19:19,628
因为你知道。
Because you do.

1316
01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:23,598
别让他毁掉你所建立的一切。
Don't let him destroy everything you've built.

1317
01:19:25,366 --> 01:19:27,234
但是，B，他不会罢手的。
But, B, he's not gonna stop.

1318
01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:28,603
那你就逼他。
Then you make him.

1319
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:32,641
只有一个办法能让黛姆听进去。
There's only one way that Dame's gonna listen.

1320
01:19:38,145 --> 01:19:40,147
如果这是你必须要做的，那么…
If that's what you gotta do, then...

1321
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:42,684
好吧。
all right.

1322
01:19:42,717 --> 01:19:45,352
26岁零1岁的他是前世界重量级拳王。
At 26 and one, he's the former heavyweight champion of the world.

1323
01:19:45,386 --> 01:19:48,222
拳击史上最伟大的拳击手之一。
One of the greatest fighters in the history of boxing.

1324
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:50,558
独一无二的阿多尼斯·奎迪就坐在我旁边。
The one and only Adonis Creed is sitting right next to me.

1325
01:19:50,592 --> 01:19:52,226
欢迎来到我们的节目，伙计。你好吗?
Welcome to the show, my man. How you doing?

1326
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:54,061
我很好，伙计。谢谢你邀请我。
I'm doing okay, man. Thanks for having me.

1327
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:55,796
是的……谢谢你们的到来。
Yeah... ...thank you for being here.

1328
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:59,033
你打电话来参加这个节目，但你从来没参加过。
You called to be on this show, which you've never done.

1329
01:19:59,066 --> 01:20:01,935
我想知道你为什么觉得有必要
I wanna know why you felt the need

1330
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,904
今天在全国电视上发表演讲。
to come on national television today to speak.

1331
01:20:03,937 --> 01:20:04,972
你在想什么?
What's on your mind?

1332
01:20:05,005 --> 01:20:06,907
当我放弃拳击的时候，
When I walked away from boxing,

1333
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,043
-我带走了一些未竟的事业。-嗯。
-I walked away with some unfinished business. -Mmm.

1334
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:11,879
你说的肯定是丹。肯定是在说他。
Gotta be talking about Dame. Gotta be talking about him.

1335
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:13,314
我们先把这事说清楚。
Let's just get this out of the way.

1336
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:14,716
你知道我相信你是最棒的
You know I believe you're the best

1337
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:16,383
世界上最强悍的战士，
pound-for-pound fighter in the world,

1338
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:17,951
三年前。
three years ago.

1339
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:19,587
你已经有一分钟没上街了，
It's been a minute since you've been out in these streets,

1340
01:20:19,621 --> 01:20:21,656
也许你还没听到他们是怎么说你的。
so maybe you haven't heard what they've been saying about you.

1341
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,223
<我>:Conlan。< / i >
<i>A: Conlan.</i>

1342
01:20:23,257 --> 01:20:24,992
<i>当你打败他的时候，他已经超过了他的巅峰

<我> B:爵士。< / i >

C:每次你转身，</i>
<i>C: Every time you turn around,</i>

1346
01:20:31,265 --> 01:20:33,167
<i>Dame正在谈论</i> <i>关于你的肮脏，</i> <i>和毫无歉意。</i>
<i>Dame is talking</i> <i>about you dirty,</i> <i>and unapologetically.</i>

1347
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,968
嘿，把声音开大点。
Hey, turn that up.

1348
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:37,438
只要有人愿意听，他就会质疑你的男子气概，
To anybody who'll listen, he questions your manhood,

1349
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:38,773
他谈到了你的家庭。
he talks about your family.

1350
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:40,307
他说你不能被信任，
He talks about how you can't be trusted,

1351
01:20:40,341 --> 01:20:41,909
你抛弃了你的孩子们。
and that you run out on your boys.

1352
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:43,578
不,不。不。等待。让我…
No, no. No. Wait. Let me just...

1353
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:45,279
等一等。我们接到一个电话。
Hold on. We got a call coming in.

1354
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,649
我们接到一个电话。让他接电话，马上。
We got a call. Put him on, right now.

1355
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:49,249
嘿，怎么了，小家伙?
Hey, what up, little homey?

1356
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:50,585
你要纸巾吗?< / i >
<i>You want a tissue?</i>

1357
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:52,353
<i>想让我过去</i> <i>给你一个拥抱吗?< / i >
<i>Want me to come on there</i> <i>and give you a hug?</i>

1358
01:20:52,386 --> 01:20:54,756
<i>好了，听着，我只是在告诉所有人你是谁
<i>Aight, look, I'm just telling</i> <i>everybody who you really are.</i>

1359
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:56,990
<i>你怎么抛弃了家人
<i>How you run out on family.</i>

1360
01:20:57,024 --> 01:21:01,428
Dame，呃，不是这样的。
Dame, uh, not like this.

1361
01:21:01,462 --> 01:21:02,831
<i>这不是</i> <i>处理它的方式
<i>This ain't the way</i> <i>to handle it.</i>

1362
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:05,032
坏消息，兄弟。这是现场直播。
Oh, bad news, bro. This is live.

1363
01:21:05,065 --> 01:21:06,867
我是说，我们现在要这么处理。
So, I mean, this how we gonna handle it now.

1364
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,969
<i>小唐尼</i> <i>什么都没有。</i> <i>他是个懦夫
<i>Little Donnie</i> <i>ain't got nothin'.</i> <i>He a coward.</i>

1365
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:11,840
你是个懦夫，兄弟，还是个骗子。
You a coward, bro, and a fraud.

1366
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:13,708
我知道。其他人都知道。
I know it. Everybody else know it.

1367
01:21:13,742 --> 01:21:16,377
阿波罗·奎迪会感到羞愧的。
Hey, Apollo Creed would be ashamed.

1368
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:17,545
哦，你弄丢了。
Oh, you lost it.

1369
01:21:18,145 --> 01:21:19,814
Aight。
Aight.

1370
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:22,517
我向你挑战世界重量级冠军。
I challenge you for the heavyweight championship of the world.

1371
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:23,951
你和我?
You and me?

1372
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:25,553
国营。国营它!
-Run it. -Run it!

1373
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:27,955
哦，当然。你们都是在这里第一次听到的。
Oh, hell yes. Y'all heard it here first.

1374
01:21:27,988 --> 01:21:29,456
<i>我知道我等不及了
<i>I know I can't wait for this.</i>

1375
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:30,859
好了。怎么了，冠军?
There you go. What's up, champ?

1376
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:32,694
-怎么回事?-黄金时段。
- What's going on? - Prime time.

1377
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:35,329
冠军来了!你们最好把声音开大点。
The champ is here! Y'all better turn it up.

1378
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:37,030
开始吧，伙计们。
Here we go, folks.

1379
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:41,736
让我们重新认识一下。
Let's get reacquainted.

1380
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:52,179
第四和第五掌骨骨折。
Fractured fourth and fifth metacarpals.

1381
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:54,148
两只手。
Both hands.

1382
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:55,249
他的眼窝破了。
His eye socket broke.

1383
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:56,216
肾破裂。
Ruptured kidney.

1384
01:21:57,619 --> 01:21:59,654
-他的肩膀不舒服。-绑架者撕裂。
- His shoulder don't work. - Torn abductor.

1385
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:02,156
他已经没有了。他退休了。他可能连体重都赚不到。
He don't got it no more. He retired. He probably won't even make weight.

1386
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:04,258
提醒我一下，你有过几次脑震荡?
And remind me, how many concussions have you had?

1387
01:22:10,397 --> 01:22:13,167
你老了，身体也坏了。
You're old, and you're broken.

1388
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,069
我们知道Dame。女士会把这该死的名单背下来。
We know Dame. Dame gonna have this damn list memorized.

1389
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:19,774
<i>他愿意做任何事</i> <i>为了赢，所以你必须</i> <i>为一切做好准备
<i>He's willing to do anything</i> <i>to win, so you gotta</i> <i>be prepared for everything.</i>

1390
01:22:19,808 --> 01:22:23,778
我们不能让时光倒转，我们不能隐藏你所有的缺点，
We can't turn back the clock, we can't hide all your flaws,

1391
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:25,713
但我们可以让它们成为优势。
but we can make 'em strengths.

1392
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,254
就是这样。两个戳。
That's it. Two jabs.

1393
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:35,790
头里。滑动。
-Come under. -Slip.

1394
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:36,858
一百一十二。
One-one-two.

1395
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:38,125
-我抓到你了。-走吧，D。
-I got you. -Let's go, D.

1396
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,629
爬得越高，就越难。
The higher you get, the harder it gets.

1397
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:44,097
这就是生活。这就是跑步!
That's life. That's this run!

1398
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:45,800
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1399
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:48,570
拔河。老派。
Tug-of-war. Old-school.

1400
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:50,805
在这里。我们走吧。再三
Right here. Let's go. Over and over.

1401
01:22:50,839 --> 01:22:51,906
推动。
Push.

1402
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,307
推动!
Push!

1403
01:22:54,576 --> 01:22:56,276
你在回头看什么，小子?向前看。
What you looking back, boy? Look forward.

1404
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:57,978
谁会这样滑倒?没有人。把它带进来。
Who slips like this? Nobody. Bring it in.

1405
01:22:58,011 --> 01:22:59,814
没人会对他手下留情，对吧?
Ain't nobody gonna take it easy on him, right?

1406
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:02,750
来吧。集中起来。
Come on. Focus up.

1407
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:11,291
好了。
There you go.

1408
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:13,628
好了。
There you go.

1409
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:16,330
来吧，伙计。
Come on, man.

1410
01:23:17,599 --> 01:23:18,900
别想这么多了，伙计。
Stop thinking so much, man.

1411
01:23:18,933 --> 01:23:20,334
把你的注意力放在游戏上。
Get your head in the game.

1412
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:25,272
看到那边那个人了吗?你还记得他吗?
You see that man right there? Do you remember him?

1413
01:23:26,941 --> 01:23:29,677
你得抛开一切，活在当下。
You gotta block out everything and be in the moment.

1414
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:32,446
不是过去。不是未来。
Not the past. Not the future.

1415
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:33,480
现在。
Right now.

1416
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:36,784
我们走吧。来吧。
Let's go. Come on.

1417
01:23:36,818 --> 01:23:37,819
嗯…
Well...

1418
01:23:38,686 --> 01:23:40,522
嘿。
Hey.

1419
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:42,824
——是……不,不。不喜欢。不喜欢。
-How's the... -Nah, nah. Don't. Don't.

1420
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:44,124
但你很好?
But you're good?

1421
01:23:44,157 --> 01:23:46,360
好到足以打败你。
Good enough to beat you.

1422
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:00,207
把手举起来。
Keep your hands up.

1423
01:24:01,743 --> 01:24:03,011
移动。动!
Move. Move!

1424
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:05,379
你可以回家了，兄弟。
You can go home, dawg.

1425
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:19,794
也许我们应该休息一下。
Maybe we should take a break.

1426
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:20,828
休息一下?
Take a break?

1427
01:25:24,892 --> 01:25:26,393
你要去哪里?
Where you goin'?

1428
01:25:28,896 --> 01:25:30,263
我才刚刚开始。
I'm just getting started.

1429
01:27:03,558 --> 01:27:04,559
我看到你了，孩子。
I see you, boy.

1430
01:27:09,097 --> 01:27:11,331
哇!我们现在就在外面工作!
Whoo! We're out here working right now!

1431
01:27:13,835 --> 01:27:16,037
他在哪里?他在哪里?
Where is he? Where is he?

1432
01:27:16,571 --> 01:27:17,572
我看到你了。
I see you.

1433
01:27:43,097 --> 01:27:45,867
来吧，宝贝!我们走吧!快走，快走，快走!
Let's do it, baby! Let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1434
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,735
好了!好了!
There you go! There you go!

1435
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:07,755
我们走吧!
Let's go!

在特尔斐健身房打架
Fighting out of the Delphi Gym

1458
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:47,942
自豪地代表他的家乡加州洛杉矶

安德森!
Anderson!

1469
01:32:30,484 --> 01:32:32,620
奎迪以冠军身份退役，但他绝对是弱者。
Creed retired a champion, but he's definitely the underdog.

1470
01:32:32,653 --> 01:32:34,822
是的，毫无疑问丹姆占了上风。
Yeah, there's no doubt Dame has the upper hand.

1471
01:32:34,855 --> 01:32:36,957
他看起来身材很好。

1472

你们都在更衣室里接受了指示。

我想要一场干净利落的比赛。

无论何时都要听从我的命令。最重要的是，任何时候都要保护好自己。
Obey my commands at all times. Above all, protect yourself at all times.

1475
01:32:47,268 --> 01:32:48,503
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1476

你现在靠自己了，小唐尼。
You on your own now, little Donnie.

1477

01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:58,345
这里的强度是我从未见过的。

我们出发了。
And we're off.

1482
01:33:08,557 --> 01:33:12,726
第一轮的大问题是，阿多尼斯会有多少铁锈?
And the big question here in round one, how much ring rust will Adonis have?

1483
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,795
三年没干这行了。
Three years out of the game.

1484
01:33:14,829 --> 01:33:18,232
从戴姆的攻击方式来看，可能会提前结束。
And the way Dame attacks, this could be over early.

1485
01:33:18,265 --> 01:33:20,535
一开始有点谨慎。
A little bit of a cautious start early on here.

1486
01:33:20,569 --> 01:33:22,870
现在还不清楚谁会是那个发号施令的人。
Still not clear yet who's going to be the one dictating.

1487
01:33:22,903 --> 01:33:24,038
别再犹豫了，D。
Stop holding back, D.

1488
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:25,873
你太尊重他了。
You're giving him too much respect.

1489
01:33:28,909 --> 01:33:32,913
安德森在奎迪的手臂上开了一枪。
Anderson gets first blood with a nasty shot to the arm of Creed.

1490

两名拳手互相打量对方。
Both fighters sizing each other up.

1491
01:33:34,882 --> 01:33:39,353
然后，砰的一声，一记重击打在他脸上，奎迪要把他绑起来。
And, boom, a stiff jab to the face lands, and Creed is gonna tie him up.

1492
01:33:43,924 --> 01:33:45,594
把手举起来!我们走吧!
Keep those hands up! Let's go!

1493
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:47,394
你必须承诺，D!必须提交!
You gotta commit, D! Gotta commit!

1494
01:33:47,428 --> 01:33:48,597
来吧。我们走吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1495
01:34:02,143 --> 01:34:03,144
来吧，D!
Come on, D!

1496
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:08,249
我要把这轮给安德森，他在这里的开局令人印象深刻。
I'd give that round to Anderson with an impressive start here.

1497
01:34:08,282 --> 01:34:10,718
好吧，小唐尼。一会儿见。
All right, little Donnie. I'll see you in a minute.

1498
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:12,453
别担心。我马上就回来。
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

1499
01:34:13,622 --> 01:34:15,723
在那里玩得真好。让他精疲力尽。
Way to hang out there. Wear him out.

1500
01:34:15,756 --> 01:34:18,259
看，这男孩是个小混混。他看你不害怕。
Look, the boy a punk. He see you not scared.

1501
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:20,127
现在他该不择手段了，对吧?
Now it's time for him to start fighting dirty, right?

1502
01:34:20,161 --> 01:34:22,096
保持头脑清醒。让他犯错误吧。
Keep your head on tight. Let him make mistakes.

1503
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:23,598
他会犯很多错误的，好吗?
He gonna make a lot of them, all right?

1504
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:25,733
窗户一打开就攻击。
And attack those windows when they open.

1505
01:34:25,766 --> 01:34:27,735
拳王，你出拳有力。
You throwing power punches, champ.

1506
01:34:27,768 --> 01:34:29,638
-放慢节奏。-我知道我在做什么。
- Pace yourself. -  -I know what I'm doing.

1507
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,905
别担心我。
Don't worry about me.

1508
01:34:30,938 --> 01:34:32,806
那么多钱也救不了他。相信。
All that money can't save him. Believe that.

1509
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,942
奎迪会不会后悔呢
You gotta wonder if Creed's regretting

1510
01:34:34,975 --> 01:34:36,611
他决定重回拳台。
his decision to get back in the ring.

1511
01:34:36,645 --> 01:34:39,246
退休似乎会更有趣。

1512

你受够了吗，孩子?

把他绑起来，宝贝。把他绑起来。
