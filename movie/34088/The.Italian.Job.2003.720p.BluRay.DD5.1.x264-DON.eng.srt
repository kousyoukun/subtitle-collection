you've put on a little weight.

- No, I'll do it. Just stay there.

please?

155
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,940
Every street in the city
will be paralysed,

156
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,277
and then you will have a chance
to ambush the convoy.

157
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,737
Very nice.

158
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,075
Now, Charlie,
first you neutralise the TV cameras

159
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,536
which overlook the convoy's route.

160
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:01,460
You do this
with these little gadgets here. Look.

161
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,880
- Yeah.
- Second,

162
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:12,054
you break into the computer building
and substitute this new programme.

163
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,806
- Got it.
- And this causes the jam.

164
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,058
Right.

165
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:23,774
Third, you attack the convoy
in your own inimitable way, Charlie.

166
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,486
And fourth, you escape

167
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,948
on the only route out of the city
which is not blocked up with traffic.

168
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,411
You'll find the details of the route
in this portfolio.

169
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,165
Within just two hours,

170
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,377
you will be over the Alps
and into Switzerland.

171
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:49,299
And within three, you'll have the money
safe and sound in a Geneva bank.

172
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,595
- Make it work, Charlie.
- I will, Roger.

173
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:04,398
$4 million through a traffic jam.

of Brighton so far is £1 5,000.

I've got a job.

lf it's the GPO, City Road,
it's being done next week.

181
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:33,510
Freddie, this job is bigger than anything
Bridger's done up until now.

182
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,721
If it's the Bank of England, it's out.

183
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,724
Mr Bridger's very worried
about the economy of the country.

184
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,980
Exactly, Freddie.
Now, tell Bridger this is a foreign job

185
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,566
to help with this country's balance
of payments.

186

Charlie, I don't think
you have the kind of scheme

187
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,198
that yields the size of profit
that Mr Bridger is accustomed to.

188
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,869
But, Freddie, this job is big.

189
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,166
Charlie, you wouldn't even know
how to spell big.

208

There are some places, Governor,
which, to an Englishman, are sacred.

218

- Well, I've apologised, Bridger.
- And so you should have.

You are not doing your job properly.

00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:40,199
The Chinese are giving Fiat
$4 million in gold

306
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,995
as a down payment on a car plant
they're constructing near Peking.

307
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,622
- But Croker. . .
- Croker can handle it.

308
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,416
He's got everything going for him.

309
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,045
There's even a football match in Turin
the day before the delivery.

310
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,047
England versus Italy.

311
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,965
So there'll be enough
English supporters wandering about

312
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,761
to cover his movements,
and even to help him, if required.

313
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,849
There's only one snag.
We need an expert in computers,

314
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,809
someone to look after the technical end.

315
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,437
Well, the top man in the country
is Professor Peach.

316
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,439
I've seen him on television.

317
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,400
- Tell Croker to get him.
- But how?

318
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,360
Maybe the Professor's not bent.

319
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:21,574
Camp Freddie,
everybody in the world is bent.

320
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,119
Yes, well, my brother's no longer
with us, I'm afraid.

321
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,955
No.

322
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:34,378
- You mean, he's. . .
- No, no, no. Nothing like that.

323
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,883
Well, actually, he's in a home.

324
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,845
Yes. Well, we thought it best.
For his own good, you know?

325
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,849
Was it serious, Miss Peach?

326
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:50,103
- Pam.
- Serious, was it?

327
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,439
- What?
- CHARLIE: Your brother. In the home.

328
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,484
Yes, I'm afraid
it was quite serious, dear.

329
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,113
- Isn't this greenfly awful?
- Yes.

330
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,951
Yes, well,
not to put a too fine point to it,

331
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,329
he was discovered in the lounge.

332
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,502
- Doing what, Miss Peach?
- Where?

333
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,965
- In the lounge.
- Oh, yes, he was doing it. Yes.

334
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
What?

335
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,009
Oh !

336
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,971
Something quite obscene with Annette.

337
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:34,981
- A net?
- Annette. She was terrified, of course.

338
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,569
- Naturally.
- Yes, well. Would you like some tea?

339
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,531
Tea. Would you like some?

340
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,576
- You're very kind. Yes, please.
- Good.

341
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,661
Excuse me a minute.

342
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,290
Annette?

343
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:56,085
Annette, would you like to serve tea
in the lounge, dear?

344
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:02,550
Oh, I shouldn't let her do that, dear.
That gives them ideas.

345
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,474
This is Annette.

346
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:16,272
Professor Peach,
do you see what I'm getting at?

347
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:20,443
Hmm. Your brawn, my brain.
I'm not stupid, you know.

348
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:25,740
It's cooperation, isn't it?
Like that flagpole out there.

349
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,035
- Flagpole?
- The flagpole in the yard.

350
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,831
I mean, I know
if there was a convex mirror up there,

351
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:37,752
27 degrees vertical,
42 degrees horizontal,

352
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,671
I could see
straight into Matron's bedroom.

353
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,883
Of course, somebody else
would have to be up the pole to fix it.

354
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,718
I couldn't do it meself.

355
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,804
It's cooperation, you see?
She's a big woman, you know?

356
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,391
Here, wait till you see them Italian birds.

357
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,394
- Are they big? I like them big.
- They're enormous.

358
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,356
- Really?
- Very, very, very big.

359
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,567
Would we wear stockings
over our heads?

360
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,737
- No need for you to.
- I'd like that.

361
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,032
I could steal one of Matron's, couldn't I?

362
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,534
We'll have you out of here in no time.

363
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,912
Of course, I wouldn't want
to get Matron into trouble.

364
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,749
Not that way, anyway. She's big. Big.

365
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,876
Look out the window, Professor.

366
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,878
- Do what?
- Look out the window at my car.

367
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,588
- Come on.
- Car?

368
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,298
- What car?
- Down there.

369
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,136
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING)

370
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:41,023
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen. Please.

371
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,696
We are about to do a job in Italy,

372
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,116
and I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

373
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,078
First, Bill Bailey.
He'll be my number two.

374
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,082
Now, you all know Bill.
He's just done three years in Parkhurst.

375
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,419
He's as honest as the day is long,
and you can trust him.

376
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,548
Second, the getaway.
This will be done in three Mini Coopers.

377
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:10,678
And they will be driven by Chris,
Tony and Dominic.

378
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,096
Hello, chaps.

379
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,431
- Hello.
- Hello.

380
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,433
All right, all right, all right, all right.

381
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,310
These chinless wonders
will get you out of Turin

382
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,146
faster than anyone else on four wheels.

383
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,356
Remember that.

384
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,277
When we get to the Alps,
we will transfer to a coach.

385
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,572
The coach will be driven
by William here,

386
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,784
better known as Big William,
for very obvious reasons.

387
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,538
Now we come to the professor here.

388
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:42,668
The professor is in charge of all matters
relating to the Turin computer.

389
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:47,298
So I don't want anyone putting him down
because he's a man of reading.

390
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:53,095
I know he's got some very funny habits,
but make him feel at home.

391
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,931
He's very important to the operation.

392
00:32:56,016 --> 00:33:01,395
Finally, and very quickly, I would like
to introduce you to all the lads

393
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,397
who are going to do the job with me.

394
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:10,404
Arthur, Frank, Rozzer, Coco, Yellow,

395
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,408
Camp Freddie you all know.

396
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,915
Roger, Dave and Lorna
will be in reserve with three fast cars

397
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,875
in case anything goes wrong.

398
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,085
Right?

399
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,171
Now, it's a very difficult job

400
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:32,676
and the only way to get through it is,
we all work together as a team.

401
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,514
And that means you do everything I say.

402
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,269
Here's Charlie.

403
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,272
Charlie.

404
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,530
Putting the jib on.

405
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,490
Well,
don't just stand there doing nothing.

406
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,325
- Get on with something.
- I am, Charlie. I'm seeing. . .

407
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,202
Well, get on with it, then.

408
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,703
Rozzer?

409
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,247
Rozzer's having trouble
with his differential there.

410
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,791
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Hurry up.

411
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,129
Dippers for the Continent.
Just changing the. . .

412
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,213
- The other way round.
- Right.

413
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,090
- Are they quartz-iodide?
- Yeah, that's right, governor.

414
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,550
All right.

415
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,970
We couldn't afford the gold yet,
so we're using lead, Charlie.

416
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,888
Will it take the weight?

417
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,015
- Take the weight.
- Yeah, all right, Charlie.

418
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,977
- Will it take the weight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's all right, Charlie.

419
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,937
Mind your face, Charles.

420
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,399
- How you doing? All right?
- Okay, but I don't like the colour.

421
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,111
It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Carry on.

422
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,281
CHARLIE: Lorna!

423
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,789
Does he really need all this equipment?

424
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,332
He says he does.

425
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,973
No.

426
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,185
You're meant to use your brakes, Chris.

427
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,562
Terribly sorry, Charles.

428
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,774
- How many cars have we got left, Bill?
- A couple, Charlie.

429
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,153
Send the next one up.
Let's hope he gets it right.

430
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,447
(BILL WHISTLING)

431
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,716
What do you mean they're written off?

432
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,803
A series of accidents, Mr Bridger.
I promise there'll be no more.

433
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,643
Five, four, three,

434
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,563
two, one, go.

435
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,370
You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

436
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,522
How's your new house, Fred?

437
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,608
Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.
Very nice.

438
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,528
My pleasure.

439
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,555
Beckerman's done his homework
very well.

440
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,142
The getaway is possible, but not easy.

441
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,937
For a start, the attack has to be made
in this square

442
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,234
and it must be completed
inside of three minutes.

443
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,737
Apart from knocking over
a few old dears with their carrycots,

444
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,863
l think we can manage it.

445
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,491
Now, you all understand
what you've got to do.

446
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,660
Okay? Now, Bill.

447
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,040
Uh. . .

448
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:35,085
Oh, yeah, the transporters
will move in here and here,

449
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,506
- and they'll block off the main drag.
- Right. Roger.

450
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,052
Arthur and Lorna park
the three fast cars here

451
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,638
in case anything goes wrong and
we gotta make a quick getaway, right?

452
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,307
Correct. Now, it's 1 2: 1 0.

453
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,934
The bullion van
will be entering the piazza

454
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,188
and will be forced slowly
towards the centre.

455
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,901
lt's the old over-and-under routine.

456
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,529
First we go over the traffic
and through the museums

457
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,369
and then under again
and up into this church.

458
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,872
The difficulty is here.

459
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,127
lf the police can get a car
onto that bridge

460

before we've got across it,
we're done for,

461
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,552
but it's a gamble we've got to take.

462
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:46,323
Now, the bullion wagon is here.
Right? Dominic.

463
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,076
We get into the Minis behind the piazza.

464
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,536
Right. Arthur.

465
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,831
We drive the Land Rover
into the square.

466
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:58,335
- Piazza, Arthur. Piazza.
- Sorry, Charlie. Piazza.

467
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,257
- Now, the Land Rover is in the piazza.
- And we come in right behind target.

That's it. Wallop.

469
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,303
But since the bridge
will be blocked by traffic,

470
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:12,391
the only possible way out
is across the weir,

471
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,977
which runs along
by the side of the bridge.

about that, Mr Bridger.

from under their noses.

That's why they killed Beckerman.

- Yes, Croker, it's a question of prestige.

01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,888
This was a big operation.

777
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:42,517
Those who were engaged in the earlier
part will already have left the town,

778
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:43,851
- probably by air.
- Yes, sir.

779
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,354
- Check the autostradas.
- But the police will be doing this.

780
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,190
We know who they are, the police don't.
Also, have my plane made ready.

781
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,025
- Yes, sir.
- They can't get out.

782
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,443
Nothing can move in this mess.

783
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:55,321
If they planned this jam,
they must have planned a way out.

784
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,462
I think you might make an effort
to keep up with the others, Tony.

785
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:12,547
All right. All right.

786
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,134
Here, make a wish.

787
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:21,180
Look out. They're behind us.

788
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,307
You better put your foot down,
we'll lose them easy.

789
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,406
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

790
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,490
(SHOUTS IN ITALIAN)

791
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,891
CHARLIE: Hurry up, Dominic.

792
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,143
(LAUGHING) Let's go.

793
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,020
(MEN CHEERING)

794
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,564
Have you heard the news, sir?
They've done it, Mr Bridger.

795
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:19,734
All the men are yelling for you, sir.
They've done it.

796
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,320
- Done what, Keats?
- The job, sir.

797
01:27:42,341 --> 01:27:44,008
ALL: England !

798
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:56,020
England !

799
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,823
Get the wheels in line.
Get the wheels in line with it,

800
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:51,200
and then slam your brakes,
or we'll be in the cabin.

801
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:59,709
You should've used more speed
on the up, accelerate and. . .

802
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:11,971
Bridger!

803
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,109
That's it. Go on now.

804
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:32,908
Bridger!

805
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:43,461
Okay, hang on.

806
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:55,890
- Be very careful.
- Okay.

807
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,604
Bridger!

808
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,901
Right, everybody out.
Start unloading the gold.

809
01:30:26,171 --> 01:31:05,459
Bridger!

810
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,570
Charlie boy?

811
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:39,243
Now!

812
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,178
Ready, Charlie?

813
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:04,768
Now!

814
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,129
Ready?

815
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,550
Now!

816
01:33:03,954 --> 01:33:06,914
Okay, out. Out you come.
Out you come.

817
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:10,250
Leave the beer. Leave the beer. Get in.

818
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:12,920
Come on.

819
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,923
Okay, William, go!

820
01:33:47,122 --> 01:34:07,725
(LAUGHING)

821
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,313
Ooh !

822
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:14,857
(LAUGHING)

823
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,126
(ALL GRUMBLING)

824
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:41,258
CHARLIE: Hold still.
Hold still. Hold still. Hold still.

825
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:46,764
Nobody move.

826
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:03,614
We're balancing right on the edge.

827
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,576
Very slowly, move this way.

828
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:11,747
Very slowly.
Don't make a sharp movement.

829
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:15,626
Come as far up this end as you can get.

830
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:41,151
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it, Bill.

831
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:54,790
The gold is pulling it over the edge.
We'll have to get it back.

832
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,855
Get back! Get back!

833
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:28,365
Now hold still. Don't move.
Don't move at all.

834
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:37,958
Don't no one get out the door, neither.
Otherwise we'll all go.

835
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:03,066
Edge back as far as you can go

836
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:07,237
to counterbalance me. Now. . .

837
01:38:00,083 --> 01:39:21,997
Hang on a minute, lads.
I've got a great idea.
