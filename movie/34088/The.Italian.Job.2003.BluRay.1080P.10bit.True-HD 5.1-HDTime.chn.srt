00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,500
<font color=#38B0DE>偷天换日 </font>

2
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,190
你好!
Hello.

3
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,790
你好，宝贝!
Hello,sweetie.

4
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,560
爸爸
Daddy.

5
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,300
还早着呢!
It's early.

6
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,840
我知道
Yeah,I know.

7
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,570
我想告诉你我给你寄了点东西
I just wanted to let you know I'm sending you something.

8
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,270
是不是很好闻的东西？
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

9
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,640
不是,是闪闪发光的东西
No, but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,650
有没有收据？
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,850
我在商店直接寄给你的
I'm sending it to you from the store.

12
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,958
你不如来我这里吧！ 我们一起吃早餐
Why don't you just come by? We'll have some breakfast,hmm?

13
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,980
我离你可远了
Well,it'd be a long trip.

14
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,260
我在威尼斯
I'm in Venice.

15
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,330
应该得到了假释官的批准吧？
With your parole officer's approval,of course.

16
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,770
那家伙我喜欢,你知道的
Well,I like the guy,Stella, you know that,

17
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,810
不过我们从没联系过
but we never really connected.

18
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,840
他最后一次造访，我已经把帐单付清了
So I think I've paid my P.O. his last visit.

19
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,470
你要干什么？爸爸？
What are you into,Dad?

20
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,378
你别伤了我的心 你说过你已经金盆洗手了
Don't break my heart. You told me you were through.

21
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,810
干完这次就收山，我对你发誓！
After this I am,I swear to you.

22
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,680
查理在吗？
Is Charlie there?

23
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,650
我用手机打的电话
I'm on a cell phone,darling.

24
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,420
明天我会用有线打给你
I'll call you tomorrow from a land line.

25
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,028
我爱你！ 继续睡吧，再见！
I love you. Go back to sleep. Bye.

26
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,830
爸爸？
D... Dad?

27
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,860
我也爱你
I love you,too.

28
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,810
东西我寄了
I sent it.

29
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,378
要逛衔应该等到大功告成之后
You're supposed to do your shopping after we pull off the job.

30
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,480
我很有信心 怎么说？
I feel so optimistic. So?

31
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,580
你感觉如何？ 很好！
How do you feel? I'm fine.

32
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,710
很好？
Fine?

33
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,520
你知道“好”代表什么吗？
You know what "fine" stands for,don't you?

34
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,220
很遗憾，我知道
Yeah,unfortunately.

35
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,310
兴奋过度
"Freaked out."

36
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,760
“不可靠” －“神经质”
"lnsecure." "Neurotic."

37
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,520
还有“情绪化” －对
And "Emotional." Good.

38
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,790
看见你身后那些柱子吗？
See those columns behind you?

39
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,460
怎么了？
What about them?

40
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,868
是用来绑那些自我感觉很“好”的贼
That's where they used to string up thieves who felt "fine."

41
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,100
你也跑不掉
Well... after you.

42
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,140
得手之后再吸
For after the haul.

43
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,880
希望有机会享受
Hope I get to fire it up.

44
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,710
收垃圾的还没消息？ 没有
Still no word from the garbagemen? No.

45
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,980
如果他们不出现...
If they're no-shows,

46
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,420
我们三个月的准备就付诸东流
three months of prep down the tubes

47
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,960
我也白劝阻你退休了
and I dragged you out of retirement for nothing.

48
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,580
这样真有趣，我喜欢
Oh,this is fun. I like this.

49
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,630
你来负责，别患得患失
You've taken over the reins, all the worries.

50
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,960
我可以轻松自在，逍遥上路
Me loosey-goosey, just along for the ride.

51
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,620
好高兴你能自得其乐，约翰
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself,John.

52
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,898
记住，警察乘船赶到要7分钟
Just remember,a police boat can get from the station to our position in seven.

53
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,840
也就是说只有4分钟给你施展身手
That means you got four minutes to work your magic.

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,240
你以前说是10分钟 这会又说5分钟
Now,you told me ten, and you said I would have five.

55
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,830
什么时候说的？
When?

56
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,918
你别搞得我一头雾水好吗? 我会扁你的
Do not be messing with me right now,okay? I will kick your ass.

57
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,940
是吗？
Oh,yeah?

58
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,548
来啊，放马过来吧！ 来吧！
Come on,take your best shot. Come on.

59
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,580
什么？
What? Uh-oh.

60
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,030
来吧   快点！
Come on. Let's go.

61
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,568
你在看什么书？ 达・芬奇
What is it this time? Da Vinci.

62
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,068
建筑家，机械专家，画家 真吸引人
Architect.Engineer. Painter.Yeah,fascinating.

63
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,770
嘿,嘿,你注意听听这句话书名
Hey,look,look. Check this out.

64
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,640
“象达・芬奇一样思考”
"Learn the language of poetry, art,romance,sex."

65
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,010
老友，我可不象你，还需要什么人生指南！
Unlike you,my friend, I don't need a guidebook.

66
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,918
能走了吗？拜托！ 遵命，老大！
Can we go? Please? Right,guv'nor.

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,780
快来干点活 把绳子松开
Come along, make yourself useful. Untie that line.

68
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,058
今天 对
Today. Yeah

69
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,320
是的，纪立根,如果你不介意的话
Yeah. Yeah,Gilligan. If you don't mind.

70
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,420
准备好了？ 好了
We set? -Yeah. I've enhanced

71
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,690
增强的电脑模型…
the viewing matrix

72
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,398
可以追踪目标的坐标及三个方向的高度
to track both the Cartesian coordinates and three altitude angles,

73
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,830
可以偏离，倾斜，旋转…
the yaw,pitch and roll to give us

74
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,930
以取得目标的准确方位值
the exact position and orientation of our baby.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,230
我们是在意大利 请说英语
We're in ltaly. Speak English.

76
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,870
史蒂夫，情况如何？
Steve,how we looking?

77
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,400
父亲在8点15乘船出去工作，所以船库会空出来
Papa took the boat to work at 8:. 1 5,so the garage is empty.

78
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,880
母亲象往常一样在8点半送女儿上幼儿园
Mama left with daughter at 8:.30 for preschool as usual.

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,910
45分钟内
So for the next 45 minutes,

80
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,980
这个地方属于我们的,先生们
we own this place,gentlemen.

81
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,850
收垃圾的还没有消息吗？
Still no word from the garbagemen?

82
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,450
嘿,你怎么变得这么婆婆妈妈
Hey,who got you the beekeepers in Budapest?

83
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,828
他们会出现的 你应该信任这帮人
They'll be there. You can trust these guys.

84
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,260
史蒂夫，我和你说过多少次了？
Steve,how many times do I have to tell you?

85
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,630
我什么人都信任，只是不信任内心的邪恶
I trust everyone-- I just don't trust the devil inside them.

86
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,110
我们到了
We're in.

87
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,290
告诉我在哪涂
Just tell me where to paint.

88
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,548
你的人还没就位？ 他们会就位的
Your men are still not in position? They will be.

89
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,710
你不能肯定，史蒂夫 我们要中止计划
Well,you don't know that, Steve. We should abort.

90
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,790
对不起！ 我认为该由查理来作主
I'm sorry,John,but I think that's Charlie's call now.

91
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,300
宝贝今晚就要运离这里 现在是我们唯一的机会
Our baby's being taken out of here tonight. This is our only shot at it.

92
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,660
查理？
Charlie?

93
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,508
继续？
Keep going?

94
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,560
你拿主意
It's up to you,kid.

95
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,540
干吧
It's a go.

96
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,210
好了，史蒂夫
Okay,Steve.

97
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,450
离西墙14尺8英寸
From the west wall, measure 1 4 feet,eight inches.

98
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,240
搞定
Got it.

99
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,718
离北墙8尺5英寸
Now measure eight feet,five inches from the north wall.

100
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,320
就是宝贝的位置
That's the northwest corner of our baby.

101
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,720
搞定
Got it.

102
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,060
好了，就在你正上方
Well,it's right above you.

103
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,630
开始涂吧
Now,paint.

104
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,460
2尺9英寸宽
Two feet,nine inches wide.

105
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
2尺5英寸长
Two feet,five inches deep.

106
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,500
好了，左耳，该你了
Okay,Left Ear. You're up.

107
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,110
离西墙14尺4英寸
1 4 feet four inches from that west wall.

108
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,390
喂
Yeah.

109
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,840
好运
Bene,

110
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,870
收垃圾的已就位，约翰
The garbagemen are in position,John.

111
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,390
保险箱在船上

112
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,200
好的，查理 有人报警了
All right,Charlie, someone just called it in.

113
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,960
警察正向你方赶来
The police boat's heading your way.

114
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,570
7分钟计时 动手吧
Seven minutes and counting. Let's go.

115
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,910
4分钟时间装货，动手吧
We got four minutes to load and leave. Let's go.

116
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,150
Whoa!  Whoa!

117
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,940
嘿，小伙子们，过来这里
Hey,you guys. Come here.

118
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,280
我提议碰一碰
I want to propose a toast.

119
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,510
为我们
To us.

120
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Yay!

121
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,690
然后再为查理喝一口
And I want to propose a toast to Charlie

122
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,100
不发一枪就到手 价值3500万的金子
because we just stole $35 million worth of gold

123
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,030
全归功于他计划周详
without even holding a gun because he planned this down to a "T '."

124
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,470
这点没人做得到 没人
Nobody else could have done that.

125
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,068
查理！ 查理
Nobody. Charlie! Charlie! -Yay!

126
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,560
谢谢
Thank you.

127
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,480
来吧，先生吧
So,come on,gentlemen.

128
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,408
计划一下购物清单和活动 可以花个痛快了
Shopping list. Who's doing what? Spare no dirty details.

129
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,510
算了吧，小伙子
Come on,you guys.

130
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,750
听老汉一言
T ake a lesson from an old man.

131
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,980
钱不要乱花，去投资
Don't spend it. Invest.

132
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,520
投资什么？
In what?

133
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,280
投资到金子上
In gold.

134
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,190
还是先考虑 如何离开这里吧
Let's figure out how to get out of here first, all right?

135
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,320
你打算买什么？
What are you getting,Rob?

136
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,860
我不知道，好多东西想买 －你可以手握巨款疯狂购物
I don't know-- there's a lot of things you can buy with a lot of money.

137
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,468
现在，我正幻想拥抱着真皮椅上的裸女
You know,I'm just thinking about naked girls in leather seats.

138
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,108
看得出来
Obviously. See?

139
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,630
来部阿斯顿・马汀如何？
Suppose I get the Aston Martin Vanquish?

140
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,038
没多少女孩不愿意坐在这种车上
There's not a lot a girl won't do on the passenger seat of one of those things.

141
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,570
我要买一套NADT770功放
I'm going to get a NAD T770

142
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,080
70瓦功率 使用伯尔布朗芯片
I'm going to get a NAD T770 digital decoder with a 70-watt amp and Burr Brown DACs.

143
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,880
这可是功率巨大的系统
Yeah. It's a big stereo.

144
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,250
喇叭声大到可以 帮女人宽衣解带
Speakers so loud they blow women's clothes off.

145
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,050
终于露出庐山真面
Now you're talking.

146
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,428
3千5百万啊 不能花得有点创意吗？
$35 million-- you can't get more creative than that,man?

147
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,828
我要去安达鲁西亚 西班牙南部，就在那边...
I'm going to Andalucia, south of Spain... right there.

148
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,358
买一幢豪宅
Get me a big house...

149
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,428
搞个收藏首版书的图书馆
get me a library full of first editions.

150
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,038
辟个房间 专门放我的鞋
Get a room for my shoes.

151
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,430
你呢，史蒂夫？
What about you,Steve?

152
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,400
不知道，还没有想好
I don't know-- I haven't decided yet.

153
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,700
还没想好了？
You haven't decided yet?

154
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,208
少来了 是不是因为高山缺氧，还是…？
Come on,man, is it the mountain air,just...?

155
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,410
我要博取众长 大家的建议都会采纳一些
I liked what you said. I'll take one of each of yours.

156
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,680
多采纳一些 为史蒂夫
Well,well,two of everything for Steve then. -Two of those. Oy!

157
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,350
还在回味吗
Loved the toast.

158
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,720
你闭着眼也能把保险箱搞定
But you could've pulled this off with your eyes closed.

159
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,260
不，你表现的 令人不可思议
No,you were incredible.

160
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,690
不可思议
Just incredible.

161
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,200
你计划周密 纵观全局
You saw the whole picture. You covered all the angles.

162
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,730
你知道的，查理...
You know,Charlie,

163
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,810
在这个世界上有两种贼：
there are two kinds of thieves in this world:

164
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,508
一种是为钱而偷...
the ones who steal to enrich their lives,

165
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,450
一种是为偷而偷
and the ones who steal to define their lives.

166
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,280
别成为后者
Don't be the latter.

167
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,450
这样会使你忽略人生要义
Makes you miss out on what's really important in this life.

168
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,120
你是什么意思，约翰？
What are you talking about, John?

169
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,620
你是个好父亲
You've been a good father.

170
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,850
身陷囹囵可成不了慈父
Sitting in prisons doesn't make you a good father.

171
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,798
女儿出生后 我有一半时间在牢里渡过
I spent half my kid's life in prison.

172
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,798
到我这把年纪 你可别象我这样,查理
Don't get to be my age with nothing but this,Charlie.

173
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,890
去寻找可与你共渡余生的人
Find somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with

174
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,000
并与她一生相守
and hold onto her forever.

175
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,360
好吧？
Okay?

176
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,500
嘿
Hey.

177
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
走吧，我都快冻僵了
Let's go-- I'm freezing my ass off.

178
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,240
好的
Yeah.

179
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,748
史蒂夫怕冷 你也是？
Steve's getting cold. You,too?

180
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,240
我没事
I'm all right.

181
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,290
我爱你，孩子
I love you,kid.You did really great.

182
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,890
多谢，约翰
Thanks,John.

183
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,300
走吧
Let's go.

184
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,670
*Money

185
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,300
*It's a gas

186
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:56,550
*Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

187
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,848
*New car,caviar, four-star daydream...

188
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,020
可惜你们没看到 罗布开船的英姿
You should've seen Rob behind the wheel of that boat.

189
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,720
就象唐强森一样
He was like Don Johnson.

190
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,380
是，从布瑞克顿来
Oy,yeah,from Brixton.

191
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,220
你知道布瑞克顿？
Yeah,what the hell do you know about Brixton,eh?

192
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,590
路中间那傻车怎么开的
Look at this idiot right in the middle of the road.

193
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,260
怎么回事？怎么回事？
What's this,what's this?

194
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,000
这是帮什么人？
Who the hell are these guys?

195
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,018
嘿 把手从方向盘拿开
Hey!Take your hands off the wheel.

196
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,180
史蒂夫
Steve!

197
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,910
不要搞什么花样
Don't even think about it-- just do it.

198
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,528
不，不
No,no,

199
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,790
史蒂夫 你在搞什么鬼？
no,no,no,no,John. -Steve, what the hell are you doing?

200
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,890
实施我个人的一些计划
Made a few plans of my own.

201
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,408
你上天入地我们都会把你挖出来 史蒂夫，你知道的！
There's nowhere you can go where we won't find you,Steve. You know that.

202
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,140
你说得对极了,约翰
I think that's probably right, John.

203
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,970
快开，快开
Go! Go!

204
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,140
查理
Charlie.

205
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,050
我们得走了，查理
We got to go,Charlie.

206
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,050
<font size=35 color=#00d8f8>一年以后，费城

207
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,330
你怎么老是摸黑工作？
You always work in the dark?

208
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,160
让我有种孤独感
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

209
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,038
不错 不错，斯特拉
Not bad. Not bad,Stella.

210
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,378
赫利没法打开这个保险箱
Damn. Hurley couldn't crack that safe.

211
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,048
斯皮尔也不行
Neither could Spears. Now you know

212
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,740
现在你知道该找谁了吧
who to call first.

213
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,318
你收费太高了，斯特拉 上头削减我们的经费用于...
You're expensive,Stella. Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs.

214
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,380
传讯及感化服务
Good will,community service.

215
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,020
我工作是为了钱，保罗我会把帐单寄给你
I do it for the money,Paul. I'll be sending you a bill.

216
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,520
不想看看里面有什么？ 我从来不看里面
Don't you want to see what's inside? I never look inside.

217
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,790
祝你好运
Have a good day. Hey,George.

218
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,760
你好，乔治 你好，斯特拉
Hi,Stella.

219
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,740
*I came,I saw,I kicked some ass*

220
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,970
*The pain I cause, it makes me laugh

221
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,700
*Cause the way I do my thing is strange

222
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,470
*Time,time for this girl to sing

223
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,280
*Damn if I thought that you would change

224
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,510
*And my life would stay the same

225
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,980
*Things will come and things will go

226
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,390
*And one thing I know for sure

227
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,410
*Is that the wreckoning, the wreckoning,the wreckoning

228
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,090
*I'm walking out the door

229
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,390
*Wreckoning,the wreckoning, the wreckoning

230
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,230
*Oh,it's time...

231
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,338
开锁用了多长时间？ 4分43秒
How long to crack it? Four minutes and 43 seconds.

232
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,938
噢！你真厉害
Oh! You're the man.

233
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,368
都有此什么事要我处理？ 托德打来电话
What's on the lineup? Todd Milliken called.

234
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,670
他手头有一把号码锁的原型 他想要你去校验
He has a prototype combination lock. He wants you to test out.

235
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,348
他说他在锁的制栓上附加了两个假的接触点
He says he added two false contact points on the tumbler.

236
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,548
我得假装被难住了 让他高兴一下
I'll pretend to be stumped for a couple of seconds, give him a thrill.

237
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,450
有位查理・科罗克先生在你办公室
And,there's a Charlie Croker in your office.

238
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,280
他说你们认识
Says you two know each other.

239
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,058
查理・科罗克
Charlie Croker.

240
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,460
你好，斯特拉
Hey,Stella.

241
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,430
难道我没告诉你 我不想再见到你
Didn't I tell you I never want to see you again?

242
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,370
你告诉我是你让父亲最后一次出手
I think it was when you told me how my father died,

243
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,810
然后他在你眼皮底下死去的时候
right in front of your eyes, after you pulled him in for one last job.

244
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,480
我们找到他了，斯特拉
We found him,Stella.

245
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
他在洛杉矶
He's in Los Angeles.

246
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,618
他从我们这偷走的金砖上刻着巴厘岛舞娘女
The gold bricks he stole from us had a Balinese dancer stamped on them.

247
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,390
我从一个叫斯吉尼・皮特 的朋友那收到风
I just got word, from a contact of mine called Skinny Pete,

248
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,550
洛杉矶有个大买家 正在吃进这批金砖
that a gold dealer out in L.A. has been buying those bricks.

249
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,680
是吗？
Yeah?

250
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,730
好，你怎么知道是他？
Well,how do you know it's him?

251
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,950
斯吉尼・皮特给我的
Skinny Pete sent me this.

252
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,000
史蒂夫把姓改为弗拉泽利
Steve changed his last name to Frazelli.

253
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,278
你告诉我这些做什么？
Why you telling me all of this?

254
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,978
我查了安全 保卫公司的数据库
Been checking out the databases behind safe companies.

255
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,710
发现有一套渥新顿1000系统
Found out Steve had a Worthington 1000

256
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,940
寄到史蒂夫的公司
delivered to his home office.

257
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,480
你没有安装Worthington 1000
You don't install a Worthington 1000

258
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,310
除非你有重要的东西需要保管
unless you've got something really big to guard.

259
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,510
不，你没有
No,you don't.

260
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,180
问题是我们无法对付史蒂夫这套安全系统
The problem now is no one in my crew can handle Steve's safe.

261
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,690
而我需要一些足以信赖的人
And I need somebody I can trust.

262
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,788
我是保险箱及保险库的技术专家 我可不是贼
Look,I'm a professional safe and vault technician. I'm not a thief.

263
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,820
不只是为了金子，斯特拉
Hey,it's not about the gold, Stella,okay?

264
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,330
约翰我也视之如父
John was like a father to me,too.

265
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,498
对不起
Look,I'm sorry,all right?

266
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,670
此仇不报我无法释怀
I just can't move on until I've set things right.

267
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,000
我已经释怀了
I've moved on.

268
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,970
来吧，查理
Come on,Charlie.

269
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,740
来吧
Come on.

270
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,880
你好
Hello?

271
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,290
我想看看那人两手空空的样子
I want to see the look on that man's face when his gold is gone.

272
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,230
他害死了我父亲 我要报仇
He took my father from me:, I'm taking this.

273
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,090
她要出手了
She's in.

274
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,268
算是好事吗？ 非常好的事
That's a good thing? It's a very good thing.

275
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,538
她可以干净利索地破解渥新顿1000
She can crack a Worthington 1000 without even flinching.

276
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,308
一位守法公民加入我们 不一定是好事
I'm not sure having a civilian on the crew's a good idea,Charlie.

277
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,638
她有技术也有动机
She's got the skill and she's got the motivation.

278
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,870
没错
Exactly.

279
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,510
她也很情绪化
She's emotional.

280
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,550
你知道掺入个人情绪是什么结果
You know what happens when emotion gets into it.

281
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,210
别自欺欺人了
Look,don't kid yourself, all right?

282
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,840
我们都带着情绪
We're all emotional on this one.

283
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,180
来吧
Let's go.

284
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,120
准备好没有？ 当然
Are you ready? Of course I am.

285
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,750
没准备好
You're not ready.

286
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,410
好快
That was quick.

287
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,150
他们呢？
Where are they?

288
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,950
我们来早了点 我没想到这么快到
We're a little early. I didn't expect us to get here quite that fast.

289
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,158
那里 莱尔来了
There. That's Lyle.

290
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,130
他是个电脑天才
He's my computer genius.

291
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,070
他是Napster（著名音乐共享软件） 真正作者
You know,he's who really invented Napster.

292
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,610
至少莱尔是这么说的
At least that's how Lyle tells it.

293
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,200
他说芬宁（Napster作者）是他的室友 把他的创意给偷了
Said Shawn Fanning was his roommate in college and stole his idea.

294
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,190
他第一次骑那部摩托
Think it's his first time riding that bike,though.

295
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,750
嘿
Hey.

296
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,760
Oh...

297
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,230
没事吧？
You okay?

298
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,700
没事
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

299
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,730
那是左耳
That's Left Ear.

300
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,578
爆破专家
Demolition and explosives.

301
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,548
10岁的时候在马桶里放了太多M80 结果爆炸了
When he was ten, he put one too many M-80s in the toilet bowl.

302
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,148
Fire...

303
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,840
真酷
Whoa.Yeah,that was cool.

304
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,188
怎么做到的？
How'd you do that?

305
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,210
什么？
What?!

306
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,650
你怎么做到的？
How'd you do that?

307
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,710
什么？
What?!

308
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,380
我说，你怎么做到的？
I said, how did you do that?

309
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,550
什么？
What?!

310
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,220
他右耳因此丧失听力
Lost the hearing in his right ear.

311
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,920
从那以后他就开始东炸西爆
He's been blowing stuff up ever since.

312
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,338
大帅哥罗布 超级车手
Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man.

313
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,070
有一次曾经跑遍洛杉矶所有的路
Once drove all the way from Los Angeles

314
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,200
只是为了创造最长追车记录
just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase. You're a heartbreaker...

315
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,490
他在监狱里收到110封求爱信
You know,he got 110 love letters sent to his jail cell

316
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,220
全是电视上对他 一见钟情的女人写的
from women who saw him on the news?

317
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,390
*You're a heartbreaker

318
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,950
*Dream-maker

319
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,960
*Love-taker

320
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,050
*Don't you mess around, no,no,no...

321
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,930
你呢？
And you?

322
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,540
那你的经历呢？
I never heard how you got your start.

323
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,630
我？
Me?

324
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,440
我乳臭未干就是个小贼
Well,I've been a thief since I had baby teeth.

325
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,810
好了，你们俩都知道怎么做了
Okay,you both know what to do.

326
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,380
交出来
Cough it up,now!

327
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,320
Come on,now, shake it,shake it,baby,ho!

328
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,320
One,two,three,baby...

329
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,420
看着，笨蛋！
Watch it,spaz!

330
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,758
Hey,now,do,re,me,baby...

331
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,228
嘿，你想干吗，小子？
Hey,what's your problem,man?

332
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,700
A-B-C,it's easy

333
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,530
As one,two,three...

334
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,398
嘿，查理 见到你很高兴，伙计
Hey,Charlie. Good to see you,man.

335
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,920
气色不错 是吗？
Looking good. -Yeah?

336
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,260
查理・哈斯特 见到你很高兴
Charlie Hustle. -Good to see you.

337
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,108
你好，查理 罗布，还好吗？
Hello,Charlie. Rob,what's up? Good?

338
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,870
兄弟们,斯特拉・布里捷
Guys... Stella Bridger.

339
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,570
嗨
Hi.

340
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,278
你好 见到你很高兴
How you doing? Nice to meet you.

341
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,300
电话呢？
Phones?

342
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,018
电话全是新的 这里是内部的芯片
Yeah,they're all fresh and clean, I got internal chips in them.

343
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,818
请每天更换两次
Please change them twice a day. We will get heat on line.

344
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,980
身份证呢？
I.D.S?

345
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,020
詹姆斯・黑曼？
"James Hymen?"

346
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,250
别这样，哥们 给我个好名字
Come on,man,one time, give me a cool name.

347
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,630
140磅？还不如写165
140 pounds? Try 165.

348
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,690
你增加点体重吧
Try lifting some weights.

349
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,928
好了，伙计们 我们明天出发，是吗？
Try lifting up these. -Guys,enough. Come on,we leave tomorrow,all right?

350
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,960
走吧
Let's go.

351
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,300
嘿，查理…
Hey,Charlie...

352
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,860
帅哥，帮他整整那部摩托
Handsome,can you help him with the bike?

353
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,840
好的，为他再摔一次作准备
Yeah,help Knievel set up for his next jump.

354
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,370
*Like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear

355
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,040
*But you can't forget, from sundown to sunset

356
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,950
*No,no

357
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,510
*It puts a brand-new kind of thinkin' in your mind

358
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,960
*And you can't go wrong

359
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,760
*Cause you're groovin' all day long,ha-ha!

360
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,320
*California soul

361
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,060
*Ooh-ooh-ooh

362
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,130
*California soul...

363
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,800
世上这么多藏身之地中
Man,out of all of the places for a thief to hide,

364
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,600
这个家伙选中了好莱坞
this joker picked Hollywood.

365
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,770
他是个混蛋 不过还有点脑子
He's a punk, but he ain't stupid.

366
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,310
好了
All right...

367
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,540
我们得想办法 进入史蒂夫的家中
we need to figure out a way to get in Steve's house

368
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,310
拍个内部结构图的摄像
and make a video blueprint of the interior.

369
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,110
我要监听他的电话
I want audio surveillance on his phone.

370
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,880
好，我来想想办法
Oh,yeah,I been wanting to try something.

371
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,118
我侵入电话公司的 远程监控系统
I crack into the phone company's remote monitoring system,

372
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,218
做些手脚使系统认为 对某线路的监听合法
and fool it into thinking there's a legal tap on the line.

373
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,858
将话音转接到我们 自己的监听电话上
Just reroute the digital copies of the calls to our own listening post.

374
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,428
我监听过我前妻好几年？
I been doing it to my ex for years.

375
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,190
多长时间？
How long?

376
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,390
是问你办成 需要多长时间
No-- how long will it take?

377
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,230
不是问你监听了 老婆电话多长时间？
Not how long have you been doing it to your ex.

378
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,960
熬个通宵 应该早上就可以了
I'll burn through the night; I'll have it running by morning.

379
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,230
对不起，我迟到了
Sorry I'm late.

380
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,210
我们要设法 让史蒂夫走出家门
We got to work on getting Steve out of the house.

381
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,878
斯特拉，破解渥新顿需要多长时间？
Stella,how much time you need with the Worthington?

382
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,548
5分钟足已 别太自负了，小妞
Five minutes flat. Don't be cocky,young lady.

383
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,640
这可不是替警察打开个保险箱
It's not the same as opening a safe for the police.

384
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,288
你的手会紧张得冒汗 心会砰砰乱跳
The perspiration on your fingertips,your heart's pounding in your ears...

385
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,310
完全是两码事
whole different ball game.

386
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,950
多谢你的关心，我行的
I appreciate your concern. I'll be fine.

387
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,258
大家记住了 上面所说是最容易的行动
Look,just remember, this is all the easy part,okay?

388
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,820
我们最可能失手的地方 就是在逃跑过程中
It's the getaway that can get us caught.

389
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,998
说说计划 我们开车到联合车站
So what's the sketch? We drive to Union Station.

390
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,598
连车一起乘上火车
Getaway car goes right onto the train with us.

391
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,630
我们要知道从史蒂夫家到联合车站的准确时间
We need to know exactly how long it's going to take to get from Steve's house to Union Station.

392
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,630
<font size=35 color=#00d8f8>联合车站 1/2英里

393
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,130
好极了 卡森安全系统
Oh,great.Carson Security System.

394
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,770
性能如何？
How good is it?

395
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,740
卡森公司每年 举办一次竞赛
Carson's held an annual contest--

396
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,710
通过此系统者可获5万美金
$50,000 to anybody that can bypass the system.

397
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,440
挑战者络绎不绝
The Who's Who of ex-cons always show up.

398
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,210
比赛连办5年 没人拿到过那笔钱
Five years running, no one's been paid.

399
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,790
好，各位 我描述这里的情况
Okay,party people, here's the status.

400
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,550
不锈钢栅栏
It's an anti-scaling fence.

401
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,420
坚硬电镀钢条所制
It's hardened, electro-plated steel.

402
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,528
我会把盐酸氮芥 涂到栅栏上的
Yeah,I'm going to have to paint that up with some nitromin.

403
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,228
房子的警卫情况？ 一名携枪警卫
Security on the property? Got an armed guard here.

404
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,868
花钱雇来的 屁股后一把9MM口径手枪
Little rent-a-cop, with a nine-millimeter on his hip.

405
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,160
不过那个保安亭…
But that booth...

406
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,400
保安亭很合 麻醉手榴弹的胃口
Security booth looks prime for a chemical grenade.

407
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,868
盐酸氮芥麻醉手榴弹 这些东西不容易搞到
Nitromin,chemical grenades... I mean,that stuff's pretty hard to come by.

408
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,540
对，莱尔,有价无市
Yeah,Lyle,it's a bear market.

409
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,270
妈的
Shit.

410
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,348
这公子哥居然养了狗
This dude got dogs.

411
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,710
狗我可应付不来 我曾有过惨痛经历
I don't do dogs. I had a... real bad experience,man.

412
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,158
怎么了？ 我有过惨痛经历
What happened? I had a bad experience.

413
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,890
该死，我聋了
Damn it. I'm deaf.

414
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,340
<font size=35 color=#00d8f8>本年吸烟致死人数统计

415
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,648
交出你的徽章和武器 哦，妈的
You turn in your badge and your weap... Oh,shoot.

416
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,080
"交出你的徽章和武器"
Turn in your badge and your weapon!

417
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,080
捏死你
Crush.

418
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,380
这桩案子里我不想见到你出现
I don't want to see you anywhere near this investigation.

419
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,720
交出你的徽章和武器
And turn in your badge and your weapon.

420
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,560
这桩案子里 我不想见到你出现
I don't want to see you anywhere near this investigation.

421
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,090
嘿！绿灯了
Hey! It's a green!

422
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,830
交出你的徽章和武器
Turn in your badge and your weapon.

423
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,920
绿灯
Green!

424
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,630
我不想见到你出现…
-I don't want to see you anywhere near this...

425
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,460
交出你的徽章和武器
Turn in your badge and your weapon.

426
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,010
真不敢相信
Unbelievable.

427
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,820
他现身了
There he is.

428
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,570
干活吧
Let's get to work.

429
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,910
到处都是堵车塞车
It's either bad traffic, peak traffic,

430
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,790
交通瘫痪
slit-your-wrist traffic.

431
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,480
今天有5个人 在交通堵塞期间吸烟致死
You know,five people died from smoking in between traffic lights today.

432
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,720
这里还有地铁，罗布
You know,they do have the Metrorail,Rob.

433
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,060
我们应该乘地铁
You could always use that.

434
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,960
带着一大堆黄金坐地铁 真是个高招，是吧，天才？
That'd be ideal for carrying a ton of gold, wouldn't it,genius?

435
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,298
你预测的时间是多少？
What's your guesstimate?

436
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,768
按我最后20次的时间计算
The last 20 times I've done the journey,

437
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,200
平均32分钟，最长50分钟
you've got an average of 32 minutes and a top time of 50,

438
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,640
如果一路绿灯 14分钟可以到达
but if we had green lights all the way, we could do it in 1 4 minutes.

439
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,410
不堵车有可能吗？
Wait,you couldn't get through traffic?

440
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,150
Whoa.

441
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,550
如果一路绿灯我们就不用担心了
We could do anything with green lights all the way.

442
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,988
莱尔？
Lyle?

443
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,820
莱尔？
Lyle?

444
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,130
我尽力而为吧
I'll see what I can do.

你很准时
You're right on time.

447
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,370
那些可怜的傻瓜
All these poor bastards out there,

448
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,310
把全付身家都放在银行和共有基金里
putting their life savings in banks, and S&Ls,and mutual funds.

449
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,470
不知道他们怎么想的银行倒闭的时候
How do they think, when the collapse comes,

450
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,210
难道政府指望得上吗？
they can depend on the government?

451
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,540
我可不觉得
I don't think so.

452
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,548
你把我录下来了？ 当然不会
Are you taping me? Of course not.

453
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,610
我从来没录过你，过来看 你自己看
I never tape you-- come look, see for yourself.

454
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,420
政府只是个傀儡而已
Governments are nothing more than puppets and strings

455
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,000
北美贸易协会 可以支配最高法院
in a world where NAFTA can overrule the Supreme Court.

456
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,070
就象我表弟口头禅 这才是我们的庇护神，宝贝
Like my cousin Mashkov always says: "This is our only refuge,baby--

457
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,770
金子
gold."

458
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,610
每次我看着这些雕刻
Every time I look at these engravings...

459
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,580
总觉得是如此美丽
She's so beautiful.

460
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,520
你说你从哪搞来的？ 我没说过
Where'd you say you got these? I didn't.

461
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,020
一点黑金
A little walking around money.

462
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,440
数目和我想象的不一样
I guess I'm not walking as far as I thought.

463
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,210
很抱歉 今天我只能买两条
I'm... sorry. I can only buy two bricks from you today.

464
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,340
协议可不是这样的
That wasn't the agreement.

465
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,510
我能怎么办？ 我只是个中间人
What can I say?I'm just middleman.

466
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,970
星期三我会买下另外两条
I'll buy the other two from you on Wednesday.

467
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,180
别浪费我的时间
Don't waste my time,Yevhen.

468
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,630
身家3千5百万的男人 晚上会干什么？
So,what does a man with 35 million dollars worth of gold do at night?

469
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,500
不过看个狗屁大电视
He watches his big-ass TV.

470
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,760
该干活了
That's our in.

471
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,460
斯特拉 天啊
Stella. Jesus!

472
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,430
查理！
Charlie!

473
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,140
你怎么进来的？ 我敲了门，你没回答
How did you get in here? I knocked, but you didn't answer.

474
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,538
所以你就闯进来了？ 我只是担心你的安全
What-- so you just let yourself in? I was just making sure you were okay.

475
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,410
我道歉，我...
I apologize. I just...

476
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,040
别看
l... -Don't look.

477
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,140
好了
Okay.

478
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,288
You got a lot of stuff here.

479
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,058
好了

480
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,398
令尊是个守旧派 全凭触觉干活
You know, your dad was old school. Did the whole thing by touch.

481
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,090
蛇有蛇路 鼠有鼠道
That worked for him; this works for me.

482
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
技术可以保证速度和精确
T echnology guarantees speed and accuracy,you know?

483
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,600
我们干的事可没什么保证,斯特拉
Yeah,but there's no guarantees in this business,Stella.

484
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,200
耳机用来作什么？
Why the headphones?

485
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,070
只是用于自我训练
Just training myself.

486
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,010
环境噪声，为了以防万一
Ambient noises,you know, just in case.

487
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,870
你有什么事吗？查理
What do you want,Charlie?

488
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,150
我们会破坏史蒂夫家中的电缆 然后派个修理工进去
We're going to knock out Steve's cable, and we need to send in a repairman.

拍下内部结构的摄像
To get your video blueprint of the interior.

490
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,750
没错
Yep.

491
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,120
问题是史蒂夫 以为我们都死了
Only problem is Steve thinks we're all dead.

492
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,300
除了我
Except me.

493
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,330
我来干吧，查理
I'll do it,Charlie.

494
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,100
我会想方设法办到的
I'm in all the way, whatever it takes.

495
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,408
好吧，我会安排好的
All right. I'll set it up.

496
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,500
好的
Okay.

497
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,110
嗯，你……嗯…… 想不想出去喝杯饮料？
Um... you,um... maybe want to get a drink downstairs with me

498
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,310
在睡觉之前
before I go back to my room?

499
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,620
我得把事干完
I sh... I should finish this stuff up,you know?

500
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,020
今天要把这些都弄好 好的
Just get it all done tonight. Yeah.

501
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,128
吓着你真对不起 没关系
Sorry I scared you. It's okay.

502
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,490
晚安
Good night.

503
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,890
再见
Bye.

504
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,370
他是媒体的宠儿
And then he's just... the media darling.

505
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,000
上了所有杂志的封面
He's on the cover of all the magazines.

506
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,370
我也应该上 <连线>杂志的封面
I should've been on the cover of Wired Magazine.

507
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,930
你知道他怎么说的？
You know what he said?

508
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,240
他说是他命名为Napster 这是他的绰号
He said he... he named it Napster because it-it was his nickname,

509
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,378
由来是戴帽子时 露出的卷发
'cause of the nappy hair under the hat,

510
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,490
明明是因为他 偷东西时我在打盹
but he... it's 'cause I was napping when he stole it from me!

511
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,490
他连业都没毕
He didn't even graduate.

512
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,950
你该把这事忘记了
I think it's time to move on, don't you?

513
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,200
他的公司也关闭了 我希望你的嘴也一起关闭
They shut him down. I wish they'd do the same to you.

514
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,860
有活干了
Here... here we go.Cable chick.

515
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,578
碧奇 好名字
Becky.Nice name...

516
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,248
不知道她怎么称呼其他人
I wonder what she calls the other one.

517
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,910
你没有女朋友真的好奇怪 莱尔
And it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend,Lyle.

518
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,318
我们需要一部 这样的设备车
So,all we need is a... service truck like that one,

519
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,410
一件这样的工作服
a work shirt like hers.

520
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,460
你觉得斯特拉能成功吗？ 我也拿不准
You think Stella can pull it off? I have my doubts.

521
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,150
我没和查理谈过
There's no talking to Charlie,though.

522
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,530
你认为...
You think he's...

523
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,860
寓工作于娱乐之中
mixing business with pleasure?

524
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,030
这事他自己才清楚 我只管干好我的活
He should know better. Only I'm allowed to do that.

525
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,070
好的 你要去哪里？
Right. Where you going?

526
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,970
搞件工作服和一部设备车
To get a work shirt and a service truck.

527
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,420
你不是耍我吧？
Are you kidding me?

528
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,190
他打算怎么办？
How does he do that?

529
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,058
看你怎么办 你在说什么？
How do you do that? What are you saying?

530
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,590
嗨，你好吗？
Hey,how are you?

531
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,460
噢,我很好
Oh,good. I'm good.

532
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,760
幸会，我是罗大帅哥
Nice to meet you, I'm... Handsome Rob.

533
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,200
你叫…？
And you are...?

534
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,208
噢,我叫... 我叫碧奇 我的制服上写着
Oh,my name's... my name's Becky, but it's written on my shirt.

535
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,200
听着,我需要你的制服和车子
Listen,I'm going to need your shirt... and your truck.

536
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,340
好啊，我双手奉上
Perfect. I'll give them both to you.

537
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,240
要不要连我的处女宝一起拿去？
Would you... would you like my virginity as well?

538
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,650
菜单上有吗？
If it's on the menu.

539
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,848
你好幽默啊 你怎么不利用我呢？
Ha,ha,ha,ha, oh,you're so witty. Why don't you take advantage of me?

540
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,790
你不是很聪明，对吧？
Yeah,you're not too bright,are you?

541
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,910
是的
No.

542
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,010
太好了
Perfect.

543
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,428
有什么可以效劳，弗拉泽利先生？ 线路不通了
What can I do for you, Mr. Frazelli? The cable's out.

00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,880
他在挑逗她
He's hitting on her.

633
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,120
这里没问题 我得去查查电视

我要复位系统
I'm just going to... reset your system.

641
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,560
有时可能 是信号堵塞了

would I be the first one of your customers to ever do that?

You know,not really my type.

657
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,978
这不是个好主意
I don't think it's a good idea.

658
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,140
为什么？公司有规定吗？
Why,is that like some,cable company rule?

659

没有，其实这是我的原则

So,I guess I have to,like, sabotage my cable,you know,

662
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:52,320
以便我们有足够的时间熟悉

他碰了我的手
He touched my hand.

673
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,730
他骚扰我
He came on to me.

674
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,330
不过至少我…
Hey,at least l...

675
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,210
制造了一个机会
I created a window of opportunity,right?

676
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,680
他周五晚上一出去我们就动手
When he goes out Friday night, we go in.

677
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,580
等他意识到你于他不利
By the time he realizes you've stood him up,

678
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,920
我们早已带着金子远去
we'll be long gone with that gold.

679

是的

680
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,490
这次你得好好把牌洗洗
Make sure you shuffle them cards this time,Left.

681
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,890
嗨，莱尔
Hey,Lyle,

682
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,760
前门和保险库的距离是多少？
what's the distance between the front door and the vault?

683
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:10,390
别趁我转身就耍花招 你这是输红了眼
Don't deal when my back's turned. You've got that loser's paranoia.

684
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,560
莱尔！
Lyle!

685
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,230
叫他Napster他才理，查理
He only answers to The Napster now,Charlie.

686
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,578
不，我不会叫你Napster
No.I'm not calling you The Napster.

687
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,478
为什么？你叫他左耳
Why not,you call him Left Ear.

688
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,570
好的，是的
Well,I am.

689
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,010
叫他帅哥罗布
And him,Handsome Rob.

690
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,318
因为他就是帅哥
Well,that's because he is Handsome Rob.

691
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,480
那你得叫我Napster
Well,you can call me The Napster.

692
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,198
他们也算同时在同一所大学读书
Come on,they were at the same college at the same time.

693
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,258
你为什么要鼓励他？
Why are you encouraging this?

694
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,220
可这是事实
It is a verifiable fact--

695
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,738
他是我的室友 偷走了我的创意
he was my roommate, he stole my ideas.

696
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,150
我才是Napster
I am The Napster.

697
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,700
好了，好了
All right,all right.

698
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:44,580
前门和保险库之间的距离是多少，Napster？
What is the distance between the front door and the vault,Napster?

699
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,788
想徒手搬运是不可能的
It's farther than you want to carry it.

700
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,800
我们怎么才能把金子从保险库搬到车上？
Yeah,but,so, how do we get the gold from the vault to the getaway car?

701
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,400
走廊是多宽，Napster？
How wide is the hallway... Napster?

702
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,950
6英尺
Six feet.

703
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,740
好的,金子装好了
Okay,you've got your gold.

704
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,970
Whoo!

705
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,248
这些重量车子承受不了
We need more cars to handle the weight.

706
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,438
我需要找人帮忙
Looks like I'm going to need some help with the custom work,too.

707
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,910
我认识一个人精于此道
I know a man for the job.

708
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,510
我修改了一下摄像机
So I modified the camera to include the...

709
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,910
就样我们就能建立高清晰度的电子地图
so we can create really hi-res digital maps.

710
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,890
那是谁？ 罗布的技工朋友
Who's that? Rob's mechanic friend.

711
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,898
你好，查理 你好
Hey,Charlie. -Hey.

712
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,220
查理，这位是扳手 你好，什么事，伙计
Charlie,this is Wrench. Hey,what's up,man?

713
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,478
罗布说你精于此道 我们需要找人帮忙
Rob tells me you got real talent. We need some body work done.

714
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,628
用这些小车运走2700磅的货物
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds of cargo in these Minis

715
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,190
小车还得有足够的马力
with enough suspension and horsepower

716
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,360
摆脱追踪
to outrun anything chasing us.

717
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,480
2700磅，是什么货物？ 你别管了
2,700 pounds of what? Of whatever.

718
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,940
我可从中获得多少报酬？
So,what do I get out of this mystery deal,man?

719
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,240
10000美元
10,000.

720
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,580
好的
All right.

721
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,300
What comes around...

722
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,130
洛杉矶交通监控及操控中心

723
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,900
非法登陆

724
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,410
嘿，嘿，嘿！
Oh,hey,hey,hey, hey,hey.

725
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,228
还没机会认识一下
We didn't get a chance to meet yet.

726
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,940
扳手
Wrench.

727
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,460
我叫火腿乳酪 噢，好酷
Ham and cheese. Oh. Oh,that's cold.

728
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,480
太酷了
Damn,that's cold. Mmm.

729
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,830
想要一路绿灯吗？ 想要就办得到
You want all greens? 'Cause,ah,'cause you got them.

730
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,270
你怎么能办到？
What have you got?

731
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,670
欢迎来到洛杉矶交通
Welcome to L.A.'s Automated Traffic Surveillance

732
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,610
监控及管理中心
and Control Operations Center.

733
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,610
他们采用特别设计的算法
See,they use video feeds from intersections

734
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,650
根据十字路口采集的视频信号来预测交通状况
and specifically designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions,

735
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,170
进而控制路口的红绿灯信号
and thereby control traffic lights,so all I did was come up with my own

736
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:58,330
我把我设计的算法篡改进去 我们就能控制交通了
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in, and now we own the place.

737
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,080
你不想演示一下吗？ 我还以为你不会提这种要求
You want to do a dry run?I thought you'd never ask.

738
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,430
看见吗？红灯 绿灯
See,red light? Green light.

739
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,130
戴尼尔森？ 怎么了？
Danielson? -Yeah?

740
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,018
34号区怎么回事？
What's up with Grid 34?

741
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,000
我们查一查
Let's check it out.

742
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,448
嘿,嘿
Hey,hey.

743
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,480
噢，噢，我...
Oh,oops,did l...?

744
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,140
真的很了不起，对吧？
Oops,wow,but it's awesome. Is that not awesome?

745
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:23,650
能马上改回来吗？ 可以
Can you change it back now? -Yeah.

746
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,550
红绿灯恢复正常
Lights are working fine.

747
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,020
一起小事故
Just an accident.

748
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,160
很好
That's good.

749
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,660
这些是什么？ 不需要的发动机零件
What are those? Unnecessary engine parts.

750
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,220
我拆了除烟装置 车身减重200磅
I lost your smog controls, and 200 pounds of body fat.

751
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,030
你现在有了部好车
You got yourself a sweet ride now,Charlie.

752
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,140
Put the pedal to the metal and I'm off

753
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,380
And never getting lost

754
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,920
Which way will I turn when roads cross?

755
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,680
Press the petal to the metal, little more when it's scary

756
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,690
But one thing for sure, keep my foot on the floor

757
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,990
Put the pedal to the metal and I'm off

758
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,690
And never getting lost

759
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,390
Which way will I turn when roads cross?

760
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,590
Press the petal to the metal, little more when it's scary

761
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,030
But one thing for sure, keep my foot on the floor

762
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,660
Won't stop driving till it's over

763
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,840
Still be cruising when the sun goes down

764
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,340
Won't stop driving till it's over

765
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,110
Put the pedal to the metal and I'm off

766
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,510
And never getting lost

767
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,110
Which way will I turn when roads cross?

768
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,620
Press the petal to the metal, little more when it's scary

769
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,480
But one thing for sure, keep my foot on the floor...

770
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,210
知道我在想什么吗？
You know what I'm thinking about right now?

771
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,410
看看史蒂夫的脸
The look on Steve's face.

772
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,100
你来早了 我很急
You're early. I'm in a hurry.

773
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,318
当然，佛罗里达的选票
Of course,you know that the Florida

774
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,630
是由CIA及黑帮操纵 是吗？
vote rigging was a ClA and mob operation. Is that so?

775
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,470
自从约翰・肯尼迪 靠着父亲帮忙
Yeah,which is not so very different from when your John F. Kennedy

776
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,010
在选举中舞弊以后 情况都大同小异
won a rigged election with the help of his father.

777
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,710
听这话你心里不舒服
You're uncomfortable that I mentioned it.

778
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,480
不是，我只是不想跑两趟
No,Yevhen,I don't like making two trips.

779
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,020
你们这些美国佬
You Americans.

780
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,880
你们爱你们的英雄
You love your heroes.

781
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,920
美国有个哥伦布节吧？
A holiday for Columbus?

782
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:12,790
他只是走错了路
He makes the wrong turn,

783
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,490
然后把原住民都给消灭了
and wipes out an entire indigenous people.

784
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,208
你知道哥伦布想找什么吗？ 你肯定会告诉我的
And you know what he was looking for? I bet you're going to tell me.

785
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,230
金子 就像在伊莎贝拉女王时代
Gold. Supposedly for Queen lsabella,

786
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,290
如果梅第奇重返意大利
but don't think that the Medicis back in ltaly

787
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,618
他也会参加这行动的
didn't want a part of that action.

788
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,230
意大利要黄金来干什么呢
And what did ltaly need gold for?

789
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,500
为了在威尼斯作长期的奴隶贸易
For the long-distance slave trade based in Venice.

790
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,590
威尼斯 就在那里...
Venice... that's where these bricks...

791
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:42,780
你刚才说什么？ 什么也没说...没有
You were saying something? Nothing... No...

792
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,138
不,你正说到兴头上 别停下，我很有兴趣
No,you were really on a roll there. Don't stop. I'm interested.

793
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,190
对不起，我有点昏了头 我的英语
Please,I'm confused, my English--

794
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,550
你明白得很
You understand fine.

795
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,760
关于我的金子你都知道些什么？ 不，我不知道
Now what do you know about my gold? No,I don't--

796
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,878
别想着能骗我
Don't you even think about lying to me.

797
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,198
好,好,我听到谣言 发生在威尼斯的一起劫案
Okay, okay,I,I heard a rumor about a heist in Venice.

798
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,940
价值3千5百万美金的金砖
35 million in bricks,

799
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,270
上面刻着巴厘舞娘
with an imprint of a Balinese dancer on them.

800
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,000
你还告诉过谁？ 谁也没告诉
Who have you told? -No one.

801
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,050
你告诉过谁？ 没有，我对天发誓
Who have you told? No one! I swear to God!

802
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,998
对天发誓？
You swear to God?

803
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,920
你疯了？ 我对天发誓
You crazy? I swear to God.

804
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,250
我没有
I didn't!

805
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,460
我应该相信你
Well,then I guess I believe you.

806
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,380
伊万？
Yevhen?

807
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,020
伊万？
Yevhen?

808
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,480
用力轻一点
Let's putt it this time...

809
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,300
推杆，不要打
Putt,not drive.

810
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,510
很好
Very good.

811
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,890
如果你去做的话... 我就知道你行的
If you can just get it, I know you can, I know you can do it. Much better.

812
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,250
我要见斯吉尼・皮特
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

813
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,960
他在那边 谢谢，伙计
Yeah,he's over there. Thanks,man.

814
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:31,130
不要盯着眼看 －啊？
Don't stare. -Huh?

815
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,490
不要盯着眼看 他不喜欢别人盯着他看
Don't stare. He doesn't like when people stare at him.

816
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,060
盯着什么？
Stare at what?

817
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,190
好的，做得好
That was good. That was good.

818
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,760
再来一次 我知道你很快会成功的
Try that one,I know you're going to get that one.

819
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,840
很好

01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,030
斯肯尼・皮特 － 查理
Skinny Pete. -Yo,Charlie.

最近怎样？

01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,520
How's it going?

823
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,970
关于那些黄金，我猜对了？
So was I right about the gold bricks or what?

01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,780
噢，我不是来说这的

那大概要五千
Cost you about five G's.

847
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,990
成交，准备好给我电话
Done. Call me.

848
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,730
谢谢，兄弟 不好意思
Thanks,man. I'm sorry about that.

849
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,330
好的，兄弟
Uh-Uh,all right,man.

850
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,400
别生气 走吧
Peace. -Come on.

851
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,190
出来
Get out.

852
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,860
那里
There.

853
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,070
万斯有话对你说
Vance has something to tell you.

854
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,370
说话
Go on.

855
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,750
几星期以前
A couple weeks back...

856
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,820
我在你表兄开的店工作
I was working counter at your cousin's shop.

857
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:41,200
一个人进来询问 那批舞娘金砖的事
A guy come in asking about gold bricks with Balinese dancer on them.

858
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,360
你跟他说什么了
What did you tell him?

859
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,460
我说我见过这些金砖
I told him that I'd seen some bricks.

860
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,470
对不起
I'm sorry.

861
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,270
那人长什么样
What did this man look like?

862
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,388
他有又长又黑的头发...
He had,uh... Iong black hair,

863
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,950
脖子上有一大片纹身
big tattoo on his neck.

864
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,780
他肯定有400磅重
He must have weighed at least 400 pounds.

865
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,810
我知道是谁
I know that guy.

866
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,640
宝贝，自己去玩
Baby,go relax.

867
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,990
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

868
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,720
你是马什科夫
You're Mashkov.

869
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,000
没错
That's right.

870
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,180
你去查问过那些舞娘金砖的事
You were asking about gold bricks with a Balinese dancer on them.

871
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,670
告诉我原因
Tell me why.

872
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,750
史蒂夫打电话来 他在餐厅预订了8点的位子
Steve just called to confirm his 8:00 reservation at the Water Grill.

873
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:20,050
好，我们再复习一次行动计划 迷倒守卫，8点15打开门
Okay,let's go over it one more time. Gas the guards, doors open 8:15.

01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,850
保险箱8点25打开
Safe popped by 8:25.

875
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,330
8点35装车完毕 8点45离开
Loaded by 8:35, out the door by 8:45.

876
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,860
直奔联合车站
Straight to Union Station.

877
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,368
一路绿灯 其他地方都是红灯
Only green lights on your route. The rest of the city's red.

878
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,270
警察也像其他人一样在塞车
Cops are stuck in the traffic, like everyone else.

879
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:33,500
火车10点离站 9点30分保证车子全部进入货柜
Train leaves at 10:00. Cars have to be on the carrier by 9:30.

880
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:36,010
时间完全正确
Timing's got to be dead on.

881
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,200
去准备一下
Let's get ready.

882
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,740
行动吧
Let's get it.

883
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,680
哇,好漂亮的车
Wow,that is a nice car.

884
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,810
对不起，罗布
Sorry,Rob.

885
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,810
他走了，伙计们
Coast is clear,guys.

886
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,530
是时候了，伙计们 成败就在此举
This is it,guys. Moment of truth.

887
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,730
这是怎么回事
What the hell is this?

888
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,520
该死！
Shit!

889
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,690
斯蒂夫的邻居在开派对
Steve's neighbor's throwing a party.

890
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,920
先生，你是来参加贝克的派对的吗 不是
Are you here for the,uh,Baker party,sir? No.

891
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:49,810
伙计们，今晚我们没法炸门了
We're not blowing any gates tonight,guys.

892
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,540
太多目击者了
Too many witnesses.

893
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,298
斯特拉
Stella.

894
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,990
我知道
I know,I know.

895
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,720
我的约会要迟到了
I'm late for my date.

896
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,020
对，展现你的魅力
Yeah,and you got to be charming.

897
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,530
你要让他再约你出来
You'll need him to ask you out again.

898
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,720
对不起
Sorry.

899
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,960
请不要站在马路上
Let's get out of the street.

900
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,118
真不可想象你竟然这样做了
I really can't imagine you doing that.

901
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,308
什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

902
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:20,290
你看起来 不像那种喜欢冒险的女孩
Well,you don't really seem like the adventurous type, you know?

903
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:23,670
别被我的工作服给迷惑了
Don't let the cable uniform, you know,throw you.

904
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:26,110
我从来不想当然
I wasn't making assumptions.

905
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,650
我倒是知道你有些想法
I've made some assumptions about you.

906
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,080
真的吗？
Oh,really?

907
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,710
然后？
And?

908
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,500
还是等着瞧吧
Well... you're just going to have to wait and see.

909
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,590
为什么要等？ 不如我们马上验证一下
Why wait? Let's get a check.

910
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:47,708
到我家去吧 不用推断了…
Let's go back to my place. No assumptions...

911
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,100
今晚不行
Not tonight. It's late.

912
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,648
太晚了，我得回家
I should go home.

913
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:54,040
什么！公司有作息规定吗
What,you have a cable company curfew?

914
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:58,160
没有，但我有些不好的回忆
No, but I've made some bad calls in the past.

915
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:59,570
嘿
Hey.

916
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,090
我们得慢慢来，对吗
We should take this maybe a little slower,you know?

917
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,640
这里饭菜可口 我们言谈甚欢
This lovely dinner, sparkling conversation--

918
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,668
你难道还不信任我吗？ 噢，不
you still don't trust me?

919
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:09,450
我什么人都相信
Oh,I trust everyone.

920
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,590
只是不相信人们心中的邪恶
It's the devil inside them I don't trust.

921
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,260
这话有意思
It's an interesting saying.

922
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:22,100
你哪里听回来的？
It's charming. Where'd you pick that up?

923
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:24,540
忘了 真的？
Can't remember. Really?

924
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,170
有个人也说过 一模一样的话
I knew a guy who said it exactly like that.

925
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,018
真的？ 对
Really? Yeah.

926
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:31,218
这句话我以前 只听他说过
He's the only person I've ever heard say that.He said it all the time.

927
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,480
他老是挂在嘴边 他的名字叫约翰・布里捷
His name was John Bridger.

928
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:37,690
你抓疼我了
You're hurting my wrist.

929
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,690
他有个女儿和你差不多年纪
He had a daughter and she was about your age.

930
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,060
放开我的手
Let go of my wrist.

931
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,078
我就觉得你们俩有点像
I knew that there was something familiar about you.

932
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,138
知道吗？你跟你老爸一样
You're exactly like your old man,you know that?

933
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,760
从一开始 我也很喜欢他
I liked him,too, right from the start.

934
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,070
直到杀了他那一刻 我都挺喜欢他
I liked him right up until the minute I shot him.

935
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,530
你到底为谁工作？
Who are you working with?

936
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,510
她是我们的人
She's with us.

937
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,460
齐聚一堂
Gang's all here.

938
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:23,178
比作贼还差的是什么？
You know,the only thing worse than a thief,Bendel?

939
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,808
懦夫
A coward.

940
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:28,830
你真该见见令尊 向我求饶的样子
Then you should have seen the way your daddy begged for his life.

941
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,000
不值得 把你的猫栓好了
It's not worth it. Put a leash on your cat.

942
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,330
好啊， 斯蒂夫 查理
Hi,Steve. Charlie.

943
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,380
不错，查理 真不错
Not bad,Charlie. Really,not bad.

944
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:48,490
你可知道我全力控制自己
You have no idea how hard it is for me

945
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,470
没扑过去宰了你有多么困难吗？
not to reach across this table and kill you with my bare hands.

946
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,078
你应该知道
You know better than that, Charlie.

947
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,760
不能感情用事
Can't let emotion into these things.

948
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,160
告诉我，你不是一时冲动
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

949
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:58,960
你杀了约翰，置我们于死地 算不算感情用事？
when you shot John and left us all for dead.

950
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,348
这和感情无关
That wasn't about emotion.

951
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,770
和一大堆我想要的金子有关
It was about a lot of gold, and I wanted it.

952
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,870
你老认为自己理所应得 不是这样的
Anything you think you deserved,you didn't.

953
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,240
嘿,别跟我谈论是非对错
Hey,don't talk about right and wrong with me,man,

954
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:09,110
我根本不屑一顾
cause I just don't give a shit.

955
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,270
好吗？
Okay?

956
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,880
你有你的牌 我有我的招
You got your cards, I got my cards,

957
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:15,510
我们公平竞争 最后我获胜了，明白吗
we made our play, and I came out on top,okay?

958
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,428
如果你还想再较量一把
Now if you want to start the game up again,

959
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,268
我随时奉陪
that's fine with me.

960
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:23,500
你们到底想玩什么招？
But what,I mean,what is your play here,really?

961
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,538
你们是怎么计划的？
I mean,come on,what do you... what do you think?

962
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,548
首先要拿掉 我的警卫，对吧？
Y-you'll try to take out my guards,right?

963
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,548
你们不知道我有5名警卫
I have five of them that you don't know about.

964
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,100
你们想让莱尔破解系统
You'll try to have Lyle hack the system.

965
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,288
但明天早上我就会把整个系统换掉
I'll change it again tomorrow morning.

966
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:38,270
最后一步是什么？
What,what,what was y-your final move?

967
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,118
让布里捷的女儿
I mean,you were going to have Bridger's daughter

968
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,158
打开保险箱？
come in and try to crack my safe?

969
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,490
真是非常浪漫写意
I mean,that's... that's very poetic and all,

970
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,610
可惜我见不到
but I just don't see it.

971
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:48,628
她根本没机会靠近保险箱
I don't think she'll get anywhere near it.

972
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:52,720
你一点没变，斯蒂夫 总是想着防守
Same old Steve,huh? Always thinking defensively.

973
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,538
所以你永远成不了老大
That's why you're always number two.

974
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,208
你怎么会这么想？ 你缺乏想像力
How do you figure that? You got no imagination.

975
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,860
拿着这么多钱 也不知道怎么花
Couldn't even decide what to do with all that money.

976
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,560
只会买点俗气之极的东西
You had to buy what everybody else wanted.

977
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,900
那你就继续想象吧，好吗
Oh... well,try this on in your imagination,okay?

978
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,318
金子全没了
That gold is already gone.

979
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,010
少放狗屁，史蒂夫 不，真的，我全处理完了
That's bullshit,Steve. No,really,it's over Charlie.

980
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,300
我正在处理最后两块金砖
I'm trying to move the last two bricks.

981
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,640
想不想跟我去看看 那两块烂金砖？
You want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks?

982
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,810
真的，我请你作客
I mean,really,be my guest.

983
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,218
真的，你的行动 有个糟糕的开场
But you're off to a bad start, you know? 'Cause you just blew the best thing

984
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,858
因为你最厉害的 手段已经失效
you had going for you.

985
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,220
你无法再攻我不备
You just blew the element of surprise.

986
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,520
攻你不备吧？
Surprised?

987
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,190
我说什么时候结束才算结束
It's over when I say it's over.

988
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,070
你没事吧？先生
Are you all right,sir?

989
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,260
你怎么了？
How you doing?

990
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,510
挺好
Good...

991
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,530
我在想…
considering...

992
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,940
我的所作的为都是
considering the fact that I'm doing all of this

993
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:23,980
为了一个很不了解的人
for a man I barely knew.

994
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,990
知道那些年我的烦恼是什么吗？
You know what bothered me all those years,Charlie?

995
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,680
就是...
It was that,

996
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:41,038
他给我电话说他他又重操旧业
whenever he'd call me to tell me that he was on some job,

997
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,610
我就知道你正在他身边
I knew you were right there with him.

998
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:51,270
你一定比我更了解他
You got to know him a lot better than I did.

999
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,340
他和我在一起时间多点
Just 'cause he was around me more doesn't mean

1000
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,470
并不代表他心里没你
he wasn't thinking about you all the time.

1001
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,410
如果是真的就太好了
Be nice if it was true.

1002
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,080
是真的
It is true.

1003
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:03,860
他总是悔恨自己 不是个好父亲
He always regretted not having been a good enough father to you,Stella.

1004
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:08,238
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

1005
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,640
因为是他告诉我的
Because he told me.

1006
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,830
你的手怎么了？
What did you do to your hand?

1007
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,948
我教训了史蒂夫
I punched Steve.

1008
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:27,910
为什么你能动手我却不可以？
Why do you get to punch him and I don't?

1009
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,820
因为你那双手太值钱了
Those hands are way too valuable.

1010
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,880
嗨
Hey.

1011
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,160
没事了
Okay?

1012
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,070
再擦下去什么都被你擦没了
There'll be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it.

1013
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,480
告诉弗拉泽利先生 我们8点去见他
T ell Mr. Frazelli we'll see him at 8:00.

1014
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:09,780
查理！
Charlie!

1015
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,420
他正准备逃之夭夭
He's flying the coop.

1016
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,868
什么时候？
When?

1017
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:19,720
他的警卫下午4点叫了直升飞机
His security guard called for a private helicopter at 4::00 PM.

1018
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,390
5点有部装甲汽车开到他家
There's an armored car service coming to his house at 5::00.

1019
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:26,200
有一架货机8点由洛杉矶国际机场起飞
There is a cargo plane scheduled to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1020
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,148
飞往墨西哥
to Mexico City.

1021
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:30,600
可能他搬动保险箱只是个障眼法
What if he's moving the safe as a diversion?

1022
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:32,840
我们打开之后却是空的金子在其他地方
We crack it,it's empty, the gold's somewhere else.

1023
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:35,348
史蒂夫不可能让金子离开他的眼皮
Steve's not about to let that gold out of his sight. It's going to be in that truck

1024
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,250
金子就在那辆卡车上
and he's going to be watching it

1025
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,780
他会从直升机上寸步不离地监控着
every step of the way from the helicopter.

1026
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,870
所以金子是要搬往墨西哥的
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1027
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:41,658
谁知道是哪？
Who knows where?

1028
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,448
在空中可以改变飞行计划
They could change the flight plan in midair.

1029
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:43,510
慢来，慢来
Slow down,slow down.

1030
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:45,080
对于此事 大家的看法都不妥当
You guys are looking at this the wrong way.

1031
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:45,868
其实我们来说是件好事
This is good news for us.

1032
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,100
查理，你什么意思， 好事？
Charlie,what do you mean,"good news"?

1033
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,060
我们想方设法要 取得保险箱里的金子
We've been trying to get to the gold in the safe,

1034
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:51,220
现在保险箱就要出现在我们面前
now the safe is coming to us.

1035
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,790
我们要在运输途中动手
We're going to boost it in transit.

1036
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,160
查理，到机场有很多条路线
Charlie,it could take a dozen different routes to the airport.

1037
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:56,760
我们不知道是哪一条
We have no idea which one.

1038
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:59,270
交通高峰期间我们 对付不了装甲卡车
We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour.

1039
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,048
我们已经安排好了
We're already set up to do it.

1040
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:00,868
Napster,

1041
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:01,518
Napster...

1042
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,308
封锁其他行车路线 除了我们指定的那条
gridlock every route except for the one we choose.

1043
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,710
强迫卡车行进到我们 安排好的位置上
Force that truck to go exactly where we want it to go.

1044
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:09,580
我们要让卡车开到哪里去
Where do we want it to go?

1045
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,980
我们没法向武装警卫开枪 我们会失手的
We can't have a shoot-out with armed guards. We'd lose.

1046
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:14,280
我们可以象在意大利那样干
We do it like the ltalian job.

1047
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,990
你好 你为什么要这么干？
Hello? Why'd you do it?

1048
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,400
干什么？ 伊万
Do what?Yevhen.

1049
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:26,150
你没必要废了他
You didn't have to clip him.

1050
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,660
喔，喔，你说什么？ 我们什么人也没废过
Whoa,whoa. What are you talking about? We didn't clip anybody.

1051
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:32,100
伊万的表弟对此 可是深信不疑
Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did.

1052
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:33,470
他为什么这么想？
Why does he think that?

1053
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,800
因为你对那批刻着舞娘的金块很有兴趣
Because you want to know about the gold with the Balinese dancer.

1054
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:39,270
你告诉他了？ 你听我说，兄弟
You told him that? Listen to me,man.

1055
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:43,030
我给你个忠告 永远别去招惹
If there's one thing that I know is never to mess with Mother Nature,

1056
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,728
反复无常的乌克兰人
mother-in-laws or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1057
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:49,290
听着，你要帮我一个忙
Look,I need a favor.

1058
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,680
喂 昨晚出了点问题
Yeah. Had a hiccup last night.

1059
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,720
需要找你作个帮手
Could use some help.Want hands-on this time.

1060
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,140
有没有兴趣？ 也许吧
You interested? Could be.

1061
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:26,800
可我不希望暗地里加入 我加入就要成为正式的一份子
But I don't like to be kept in the dark. If I'm in,I'm in.

1062
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:28,980
好的，算你一份
Okay,you're in.

1063
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,590
好的
All right.

1064
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:37,150
怎么样，查理？ 没问题，走吧
What do you think,Charlie? This'll work. Let's go.

1065
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,890
你真了不起 天才的杰作
You're amazing. It's a work of genius.

1066
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,930
Uh-huh.

1067
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,120
你没事吧？
You okay?

1068
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,830
是的，让我休息一会 现在？
Just give me a moment. Now?

1069
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:08,138
我要把这东西插入雷管里
I'm about to insert this pin into this detonator tube,

1070
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,660
如果上面的铜皮碰到雷管
and if the brass touches the sides,

1071
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:13,530
我们就会与世长辞
we'll both be the last people we ever see.

1072
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,670
那你愿意休息多久 就休多久吧
T ake all the time you need.

1073
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:25,120
嘿，查理？ 怎么了？
Hey,Charlie. What?

1074
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,810
我爱你，伙计
I love you,man.

1075
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,960
我也爱你
I love you,too.

1076
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,720
好的
Okay.

1077
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,250
好的
Okay.

1078
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,340
他会出现在开往 新奥尔良的59次车上

1079
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,570
消息来源可靠吗？

1080
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,080
绝对可靠

1081
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:52,870
请注意 774次列车 在15分钟后到站
Metrolink train number 774 will arrive in approximately 1 5 minutes.

1082
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,320
报告各自位置
Check positions.

1083
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:12,560
Napster？
Napster?

1084
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:14,060
我已经就位
I'm in position.

1085
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:16,710
帅哥罗布？
Handsome Rob?

1086
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:20,470
我们已经就位 周围很安静
We're in position. Everything's quiet,Charlie.

1087
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:24,500
扳手？
Wrench?

1088
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,600
布置妥当
Set.

1089
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,050
查理，有不速之客
Charlie,we got an uninvited visitor.

1090
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:47,560
卡车后有摩托手押车
Some motorcycle guard following the truck.

1091
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:49,360
我们会安排的
We'll deal with it.

1092
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,690
这些车是什么？
Who are these cats?

1093
01:21:56,690 --> 01:22:00,110
怎么了？ 查理，真不敢相信
What's wrong? Charlie,you won't believe this.

1094
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,990
他叫了三部装甲卡车来
He's brought in three armored trucks.

1095
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,710
真真假假的障眼法
It's a shell game. Shell game now.

1096
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:09,020
老大，我不知道是哪部车 可没法控制车的行进路线
Well,boss, I can't reroute the truck if I don't know which truck to reroute.

1097
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,490
就是直升机 跟着的那辆车
Just go with the one Steve follows in the helicopter.

1098
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,290
记住，他说过永远不会 让金子离开他的视线
Remember,he said he'd never let that gold out of his sight.

1099
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,760
除非他耍我们 要不就是那部车
Unless he's playing us, and he is.

1100
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,630
好的，出发
Okay,let's go!

1101
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:31,340
动身
Moving out!

1102
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,000
来了
Here we go.

1103
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,700
他们动身了
They're pulling out.

1104
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,310
Napster 移动监控摄像机
Napster, pull up the traffic cameras you're watching.

1105
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,760
卡车通过的 第一个路口是哪里？
Where's the first camera the trucks go past?

1106
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,920
维恩和加科路口 三部车都会经过那里
Vine and Yucca; they're all going to cross there.

1107
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,360
看一下哪部车车身较低
See which one's riding low.

1108
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,650
第一部是…
First one is...

1109
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,090
第二部也一样，所以…
First two are the same,so...

1110
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:27,000
休斯敦，目标找到，车号128
Houston,we have our truck. It is number 1 28.

1111
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,000
我们跟在后面
We're moving out.

1112
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:42,680
三千 呼叫 双狐 我们正前往机场
Three-kilo-bob to two-fox-mike, we're heading to the airport.

1113
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,850
好了伙计们 128号车转右向西去了
Okay,guys,truck 1 28 has turned right heading west.

1114
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,960
堵塞交通
Gridlock time.

1115
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,430
系统崩溃了
We've crashed.

1116
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,710
不是崩溃
It's not a crash.

1117
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,410
也没有停电
We've got power.

1118
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:23,000
我无法登录
I can't log in.

1119
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,400
准备让他们兜个大圈 然后送到门口上来
They are about to hit a major detour and be sent your way.

1120
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,790
喔
Oops.

1121
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,060
你们…永远无法…关闭…
You'll... never... shut down...

1122
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:46,410
真正的…Napster
the real... Napster.

1123
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,270
128号车 你们进展如何？
Truck 1 28, what is your progress?

1124
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,260
这里是128号车
This is truck 1 28.

1125
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:08,880
这里交通失控 我们得走另一条路
Traffic's out of control here. We've got to look for another route.

1126
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:12,310
监听警察的通讯
Check the police band.

1127
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:14,890
好的，我给你们开出一条通道
Okay,I'm opening up a space on Highland.

1128
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,270
快离开这里 我正在想办法
Oh,get us out of here. I'm trying.

1129
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,240
中招了
And he's taking it.

1130
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,740
交通管制中心的电脑 崩溃了
Police scanners are saying computers are down at Traffic Control Center.

1131
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:39,850
干得好，查理
Nice,Charlie.

1132
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,440
你到底想干什么？ 回头
What are you up to? Go back.

1133
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,970
我现在命令你左转

快点，往左转

1135
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,460
听话 真听话
Yeah,you did. You did.

1136
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,400
给我们指示
Give us the flag.

1137
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:43,620
地铁刚刚离站 你们有90秒的时间
Metro just passed through the station. You are clear for 90 seconds.

1138
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:44,820

1139
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,470

Come on,Steve.

1140
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:19,440

01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,830
还剩30秒

1142
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,650
还有15秒，不成功便成仁
1 5 seconds, you're either blocked in or you're paint on the train.

1143
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,380

冷静
Stay cool.

1150
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:54,920

01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,660
5... five...

1156
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,160
4... four...

1157
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:05,790
别跟丢，别跟丢 别跟丢
Don't lose 'em, don't lose 'em,

1158
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:07,230
3... don't lose them. -three...

1159
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:08,500
2... two...

1160
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,550
one.

1161
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,490
该死
Damn.

1162
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:41,730
我的车去哪了？
Where's my truck?

1163
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,300
我的车出了什么事？
What...? What the fuck happened to my truck?!

1164
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,510
街上发生爆炸
It just blew right through the street.

1165
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,350
好的，快下去
Well,get under there.

1166
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:06,650
麻烦来了，伙计们 怎么了？
We have another problem,guys. What?

1167
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,560
这不是渥新顿1000 什么？
This isn't the Worthington 1000. What?

1168
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,570
他换了个保险箱
He switched safes on us.

1169
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,270
你能搞定吗？ 以色列出产的
Can you do it? It's lsraeli made.

1170
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,040
带有玻璃防盗系统
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1171
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,240
门后面是一大块玻璃
There's a pane of glass right here behind this door.

1172
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:22,990
如果钻孔的位置稍有偏差
And if I don't drill perfectly through that hole,

1173
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:26,090
内部的钢条 把门锁死之后
steel rods snap into place and you can't open the safe.

1174
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,810
就无法打开保险箱 我们的麻烦可就大了
And then we're up shit creek.

1175
01:30:57,190 --> 01:31:01,050
我刚才碰到玻璃了
I think I just cracked the glass.

1176
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,870
应该还没碎
I don't think it broke though.

1177
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:06,740
我不能再钻了
I can't drill it again.

1178
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,380
现在只能凭触觉了
I have to do it by touch.

1179
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:14,430
我过不去 地铁把通道堵住了
I can't get through. The train's blocking the tunnel.

1180
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,560
地铁从哪里上到地面？
Where does the Metro rail come above ground?

1181
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:19,130
11大街和菲格大街交叉处
11th and Fig. Positions two and three,

1182
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,300

1183
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,180
然后再兜回到出事地点
to Hollywood and Highland.

1184
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,030

I can't do this,Charlie. Stella...

1191
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,140
我不行了 我得用钻头管道镜之类的东西…
I can't do it-- I need a drill, a borescope,something.

1192
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,800
我需要... 你不需要
I need to... -You don't need any of that.

1193
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:30,970

1196
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:30,560
斯特拉

1197
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:32,200
快点，快点，快点
Come on,come on.

1198
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:42,480
嘿，不想看看里面吗？
Hey. Don't you want to see what's inside?

1199
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,010
当然想
Absolutely.

1200
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,250
Napster 是
Napster. Yeah?

1201
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,620
每排13个，高度4，深度4

总共208块金砖
That's,uh,208 bricks.

1203
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:57,190
价值多少？
How much?

1204
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:59,130
208乘以…
Oh. Uh,208 times...

1205
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,690
2百70万
2.7... 2.7 million.

1206
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:05,860
什么？
What?

1207
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,320
不,是2千7百万
No,it's 27.

1208

1211
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:22,030
老天保佑

01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:24,480
你们继续吧，这趟车真不错
You should get on it. It's a good train.

1213
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:03,730

What did you think,John?

1214
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:13,010

1215
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,330

1219
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,460
有两部摩托跟着我们
Two motorcycles on us,Charlie.

1220
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:52,060
三部小车通过下水道 向东前往洛杉矶河
I've got three Minis in the storm drain heading east towards the L.A. River.

1221
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:53,730
别让他们到达地面
Stop them before they get to the street.

1222
01:35:58,590 --> 01:36:00,340
该死
Shit!

1223
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:04,880

They got a bunch of cars in there,right?

1244
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:46,660
迷你库柏斯？
Mini Coopers?

1245
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:48,460
听着，哥们 我什么都不知道

你可真是机关算尽
You actually played this one pretty smart.

1253
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,990
真真假假的卡车 换了型号的保险箱
Decoy trucks... you switched safes.

1254
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:29,780

The helicopter routine, I mean,that was pretty damn good.

1255

But now I've got the gold-- and you,you've got nothing.

1256
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:34,640

1257
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:37,650
少跟我废话 把金子还给我
So cut the crap, and give me my goddamn gold!

1258

你是什么人？
Who the hell are you?

1259
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,290
我叫马什科夫…
I am Mashkov...

1260
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:57,460
你杀了我的表兄伊万

1261
01:42:57,530 --> 01:43:00,130
你应该买份保险，史蒂夫

我到那里伊万已经死了

那边有很多金子
There's a lot of gold in there.

1268
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:27,620
这里只有我们有枪 我们作笔好买卖
We're the only ones with guns. I'll make you a good deal.

1270

1271
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,930
你知道这和金子没有关系

1282
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:27,630
伙计们，我们碰一杯

Share it fairly,but don't take a slice of my pie

1320
