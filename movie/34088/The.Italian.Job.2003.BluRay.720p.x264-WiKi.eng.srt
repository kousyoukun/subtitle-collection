1
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,191
Hello.

2
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,257
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,133
Daddy.

4
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:53,466
It's early.

5
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,130
Yeah, I know.

6
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,767
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,471
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

8
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:01,672
No,

9
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:03,578
but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,845
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,787
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

12
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,424
Why don't you just come by?

13
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,154
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

14
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,662
Well, it'd be a long trip.

15
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,199
I'm in Venice.

16
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,636
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

17
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,970
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

18
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,100
but we never really connected.

19
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,975
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

20
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,673
What are you into, Dad?

21
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,874
Don't break my heart.

22
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,541
You told me you were through.

23
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:41,381
After this I am, I swear to you.

24
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,884
Is Charlie there?

25
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,652
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

26
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,127
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

27
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,322
I love you.

28
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,989
Go back to sleep. Bye.

29
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,498
D... Dad?

30
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,764
I love you, too.

31
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,912
I sent it.

32
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,539
You're supposed
to do your shopping

33
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,844
after we pull off the job.

34
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,077
I feel so optimistic.

35
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,414
So?

36
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,852
How do you feel?

37
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,411
I'm fine.

38
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,718
Fine?

39
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,725
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

40
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,385
Yeah, unfortunately.

41
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,621
"Freaked out."

42
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,720
-"lnsecure."
-"Neurotic."

43
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,287
-And "Emotional."
-Good.

44
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,526
See those columns behind you?

45
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,393
What about them?

46
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,734
That's where they used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,738
who felt "fine."

48
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,775
Well... after you.

49
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,014
For after the haul.

50
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,781
Hope I get to fire it up.

51
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:50,446
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,649
No.

53
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,656
If they're no-shows,

54
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,124
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,161
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,889
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

57
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,557
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,158
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

59
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,759
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

60
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:05,929
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,973
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,940
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

63
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,237
Now, you told me ten,

64
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,175
and you said I would have five.

65
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,974
When?

66
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,913
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

67
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,418
-I will kick your ass.
-Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,749
Come on, take your best shot.

69
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,754
Come on.

70
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,154
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,767
Come on.

72
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,962
Let's go.

73
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,436
What is it this time?

74
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,870
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,134
Engineer. Painter.

76
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,436
Yeah, fascinating.

77
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,635
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,441
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

79
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,113
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,446
Can we go? Please?

81
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,953
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,454
Come along,
make yourself useful.

83
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,717
Untie that line.

84
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,917
T oday.

85
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,050
Yeah.

86
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,115
Yeah, Gilligan.

87
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,252
If you don't mind.

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,626
-We set?
-Yeah. I've enhanced

89
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,931
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,403
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,030
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,665
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

93
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,709
We're in ltaly.

94
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,004
Speak English.

95
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,772
Steve, how we looking?

96
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:58,408
Papa took the boat to work at
8:. 1 5, so the garage is empty.

97
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:02,818
Mama left with daughter
at 8:.30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,049
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,853
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,258
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,387
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,521
They'll be there.

103
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,963
You can trust these guys.

104
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,399
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

105
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:20,904
I trust everyone-- I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,088
We're in.

107
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,498
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,211
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,774
They will be.

110
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,844
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:46,721
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,663
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

113
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:54,892
This is our only shot at it.

114
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,598
Charlie?

115
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,366
Keep going?

116
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,375
It's up to you, kid.

117
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,375
It's a go.

118
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,149
Okay, Steve.

119
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:17,149
From the west wall,
measure 1 4 feet, eight inches.

120
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,382
Got it.

121
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,152
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

122
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,783
from the north wall.

123
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,555
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

124
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,954
Got it.

125
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,055
Well, it's right above you.

126
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,423
Now, paint.

127
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,832
Two feet, nine inches wide.

128
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,996
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:09,267
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

130
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,008
1 4 feet four inches
from that west wall.

131
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,269
Yeah.

132
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,440
Bene,

133
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:47,234
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,726
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:54,465
The police boat's
heading your way.

136
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,131
Seven minutes and counting.

137
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,505
Let's go.

138
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:20,155
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

139
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,084
Whoa! Whoa!

140
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,372
Hey, you guys. Come here.

141
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:38,816
I want to propose a toast.

142
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,824
T o us.

143
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:41,859
Yay!

144
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,824
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

145
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:51,300
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

146
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,269
without even holding a gun

147
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,965
because he planned this
down to a "T '."

148
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,270
Nobody else
could have done that.

149
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,366
Nobody. Charlie!

150
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,172
-Charlie!
-Yay!

151
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,974
Thank you.

152
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,275
So, come on, gentlemen.

153
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,077
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

154
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,378
Spare no dirty details.

155
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:07,781
Come on, you guys.

156
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:10,047
T ake a lesson from an old man.

157
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,850
Don't spend it.
Invest.

158
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,655
In what?

159
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,591
In gold.

160
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,928
Let's figure out

161
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,125
how to get out of here first,
all right?

162
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,259
What are you getting, Rob?

163
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,633
I don't know--
there's a lot of things

164
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,796
you can buy with a lot of money.

165
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,600
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

166
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:29,833
in leather seats.

167
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,398
Obviously. See?

168
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,637
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

169
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,974
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

170
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,071
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

171
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,817
I'm going to get a NAD T770

172
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:38,839
I'm going to get a NAD T770

173
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,715
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

174
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:43,651
Yeah.

175
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,814
It's a big stereo.

176
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,084
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

177
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,318
Now you're talking.

178
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,419
$35 million-- you can't get
more creative than that, man?

179
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,657
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

180
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,200
right there.

181
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,825
Get me a big house...

182
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,529
get me a library
full of first editions.

183
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:00,901
Get a room for my shoes.

184
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,940
What about you, Steve?

185
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,374
I don't know--
I haven't decided yet.

186
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,239
You haven't decided yet?

187
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,177
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

188
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,179
I liked what you said.

189
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,715
I'll take one of each of yours.

190
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,010
Well, well, two of everything

191
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,519
-for Steve then.
-Two of those.

192
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,612
Oy!

193
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,690
Loved the toast.

194
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,958
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

195
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,364
No, you were incredible.

196
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,867
Just incredible.

197
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,368
You saw the whole picture.

198
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,699
You covered all the angles.

199
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,536
You know, Charlie,

200
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,702
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

201
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,372
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

202
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,383
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

203
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,385
Don't be the latter.

204
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,546
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

205
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,385
in this life.

206
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,891
What are you talking about,
John?

207
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,392
You've been a good father.

208
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,056
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

209
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,656
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

210
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,670
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

211
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,731
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

212
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,868
and hold onto her forever.

213
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,970
-Okay?
-Hey.

214
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,072
Let's go--
I'm freezing my ass off.

215
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:20,413
Yeah.

216
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,419
Steve's getting cold.

217
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,920
You, too?

218
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,080
I'm all right.

219
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,753
I love you, kid.

220
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,225
You did really great.

221
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,762
Thanks, John.

222
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,231
Let's go.

223
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,604
Money

224
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,238
It's a gas

225
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:56,482
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

226
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:00,022
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

227
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,888
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

228
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,587
He was like Don Johnson.

229
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,686
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

230
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,857
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

231
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,905
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

232
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,499
What's this, what's this?

233
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,481
Who the hell are these guys?

234
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:27,944
Hey!

235
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,111
T ake your hands off the wheel.

236
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:29,846
Steve!

237
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:35,158
Don't even think about it--
just do it.

238
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,396
No, no, no, no,

239
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,660
-no, no, no, no, John.
-Steve,

240
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,666
what the hell are you doing?

241
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,100
Made a few plans of my own.

242
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,773
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

243
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,774
You know that.

244
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,071
I think that's probably right,
John.

245
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:54,678
Go! Go!

246
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,077
Charlie.

247
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,122
We got to go, Charlie.

248
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,601
You always work in the dark?

249
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,337
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

250
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:16,645
Not bad.

251
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,409
Not bad, Stella.

252
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,245
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

253
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,546
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

254
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:22,551
who to call first.

255
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,587
You're expensive, Stella.

256
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:26,418
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

257
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,218
Good will, community service.

258
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,385
I do it for the money, Paul.

259
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:31,951
I'll be sending you a bill.

260
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,827
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

261
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:34,922
I never look inside.

262
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,594
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

263
00:25:37,668 --> 00:25:38,692
Hi, Stella.

264
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,671
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

265
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,902
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

266
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,637
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

267
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,407
Time, time for this girl
to sing

268
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,210
Damn if I thought
that you would change

269
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:54,444
And my life would stay
the same

270
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,918
Things will come
and things will go

271
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,320
And one thing I know
for sure

272
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,349
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

273
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,020
I'm walking out the door

274
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,327
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

275
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,162
Oh, it's time...

276
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:14,603
How long to crack it?

277
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:17,072
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

278
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,073
Oh! You're the man.

279
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,131
What's on the lineup?

280
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,336
T odd Milliken called.

281
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,935
He has a prototype
combination lock.

282
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,344
He wants you to test out.

283
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:24,540
He says he added

284
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:27,584
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

285
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,415
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

286
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,612
give him a thrill.

287
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:32,918
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

288
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,219
Says you two know each other.

289
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:42,030
Charlie Croker.

290
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,624
Hey, Stella.

291
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:48,628
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

292
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,271
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

293
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,776
right in front of your eyes,

294
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,710
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

295
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,141
We found him, Stella.

296
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,950
He's in Los Angeles.

297
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,080
The gold bricks he stole from us

298
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,488
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

299
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:08,786
I just got word,

300
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,225
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

301
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:12,626
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

302
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,324
Yeah?

303
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:15,763
Well, how do you know it's him?

304
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,559
Skinny Pete sent me this.

305
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,798
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

306
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,777
Why you telling me
all of this?

307
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,042
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

308
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,674
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1 000

309
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,184
delivered to his home office.

310
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,686
You don't install
a Worthington 1 000

311
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:38,346
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

312
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:39,411
No, you don't.

313
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,422
The problem now is no one

314
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,753
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

315
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,919
And I need somebody
I can trust.

316
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,587
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

317
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,925
I'm not a thief.

318
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,863
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

319
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,161
John was like a father
to me, too.

320
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:57,135
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

321
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,142
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

322
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,782
I've moved on.

323
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,575
Come on, Charlie.

324
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,675
Come on.

325
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,887
Hello?

326
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,824
I want to see the look
on that man's face

327
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:25,225
when his gold is gone.

328
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,459
He took my father from me:,
I'm taking this.

329
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,936
She's in.

330
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,632
That's a good thing?

331
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:36,764
It's a very good thing.

332
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,706
She can crack a Worthington 1 000
without even flinching.

333
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,266
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

334
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:41,402
a good idea, Charlie.

335
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:42,410
She's got the skill

336
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:43,605
and she's got the motivation.

337
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,114
Exactly.

338
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:46,410
She's emotional.

339
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,712
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

340
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,344
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

341
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,820
We're all emotional on this one.

342
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,119
Let's go.

343
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,715
Are you ready?

344
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:56,885
Of course I am.

345
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,055
You're not ready.

346
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:27,816
That was quick.

347
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:28,950
Where are they?

348
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,220
We're a little early.

349
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:32,888
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

350
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,123
There.

351
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,257
That's Lyle.

352
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,961
He's my computer genius.

353
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:45,441
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

354
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:46,908
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

355
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:50,105
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

356
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,012
and stole his idea.

357
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:06,922
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

358
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,634
Hey.

359
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,696
Oh...

360
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,369
You okay?

361
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,208
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

362
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:21,369
That's Left Ear.

363
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:23,445
Demolition and explosives.

364
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,446
When he was ten,

365
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,413
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

366
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,112
Fire...

367
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:30,881
Whoa.

368
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,047
Yeah, that was cool.

369
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,317
How'd you do that?

370
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,415
What?!

371
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,789
How'd you do that?

372
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,849
What?!

373
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,293
I said,
how did you do that?

374
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:41,729
What?!

375
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,426
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

376
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,696
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

377
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,334
Handsome Rob.

378
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,466
Premier wheel man.

379
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,940
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

380
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,910
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

381
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,983
-You're a heartbreaker...
-You know, he got 1 1 0

382
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:07,421
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

383
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,083
from women
who saw him on the news?

384
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,321
You're a heartbreaker

385
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:12,885
Dream-maker

386
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:13,895
Love-taker

387
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:15,989
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

388
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,167
And you?

389
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,730
I never heard
how you got your start.

390
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,936
Me?

391
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,707
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

392
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,840
Okay, you both know what to do.

393
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,316
Cough it up, now!

394
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,253
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

395
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:40,256
One, two, three, baby...

396
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,285
Watch it, spaz!

397
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,054
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

398
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,095
Hey, what's your problem, man?

399
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:47,630
A-B-C, it's easy

400
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:49,461
As one, two, three...

401
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:51,466
Hey, Charlie.

402
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:52,661
Good to see you, man.

403
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,930
-Looking good.
-Yeah?

404
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:56,404
-Charlie Hustle.
-Good to see you.

405
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,406
Hello, Charlie.

406
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,067
Rob, what's up?
Good?

407
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,633
Guys...

408
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,803
Stella Bridger.

409
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,109
Hi.

410
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:05,113
How you doing?

411
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,308
Nice to meet you.

412
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:07,407
Phones?

413
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,678
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

414
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,185
I got internal chips in them.

415
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,346
Please change them twice a day.

416
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,151
We will get heat on line.

417
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,418
I.D.s?

418
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,292
"James Hymen?"

419
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:20,592
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

420
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,825
1 40 pounds? Try 1 65.

421
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,162
Try lifting some weights.

422
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,668
-Try lifting up these.
-Guys, enough.

423
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:27,169
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

424
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,170
Let's go.

425
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,331
Hey, Charlie...

426
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,438
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

427
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,707
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

428
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,308
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

429
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:43,979
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

430
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:46,887
No, no

431
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:49,448
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

432
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:50,890
And you can't go wrong

433
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:55,694
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

434
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,257
California soul

435
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,997
Ooh-ooh-ooh

436
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:05,064
California soul...

437
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,804
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

438
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,539
this joker picked Hollywood.

439
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:11,877
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

440
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,416
All right...

441
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,280
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

442
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:17,081
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

443
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:19,281
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

444
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:20,846
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

445
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,358
I crack into the phone company's

446
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,189
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

447
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:25,285
there's a legal tap on the line.

448
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:26,329
Just reroute the digital copies

449
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,864
of the calls to our own
listening post.

450
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,297
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

451
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:30,833
How long?

452
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,528
No-- how long will it take?

453
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,127
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

454
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,933
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

455
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,138
Sorry I'm late.

456
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,007
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

457
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,740
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

458
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,282
Five minutes flat.

459
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,817
Don't be cocky, young lady.

460
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,012
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

461
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:53,015
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

462
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,557
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

463
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,683
whole different ball game.

464
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,228
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

465
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,091
Look, just remember,

466
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,224
this is all the easy part, okay?

467
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,562
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

468
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,761
So what's the sketch?

469
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:06,860
We drive to Union Station.

470
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:09,735
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

471
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,399
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

472
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,533
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

473
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,738
Oh, great.

474
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,140
Carson Security System.

475
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,076
How good is it?

476
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,807
Carson's held
an annual contest--

477
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,441
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

478
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,018
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

479
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:59,249
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

480
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,917
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

481
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:03,289
It's an anti-scaling fence.

482
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,328
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

483
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,387
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

484
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:08,556
with some nitromin.

485
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:09,894
Security on the property?

486
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,332
Got an armed guard here.

487
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,391
Little rent-a-cop,

488
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:13,902
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

489
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,370
But that booth...

490
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,374
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

491
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,807
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

492
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,004
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

493
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,876
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

494
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:27,410
Shit.

495
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,216
This dude got dogs.

496
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,084
I don't do dogs.

497
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,647
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

498
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,987
What happened?

499
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,257
I had a bad experience.

500
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,058
Damn it. I'm deaf.

501
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,442
You turn in your badge

502
00:36:57,581 --> 00:36:59,606
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

503
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:01,981
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

504
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:03,985
Crush.

505
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:05,043
I don't want to see you

506
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,317
anywhere near
this investigation.

507
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,224
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

508
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,226
I don't want to see you

509
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,853
anywhere near
this investigation.

510
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,257
Hey! It's a green!

511
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,894
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

512
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,767
-Green!
-I don't want to see you

513
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,567
anywhere near this...

514
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,169
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

515
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,709
Unbelievable.

516
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,327
There he is.

517
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:05,741
Let's get to work.

518
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:12,214
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

519
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,722
slit-your-wrist traffic.

520
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,021
You know, five people died
from smoking

521
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,390
in between traffic lights today.

522
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,395
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

523
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,760
You could always use that.

524
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,957
That'd be ideal

525
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,966
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

526
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,162
What's your guesstimate?

527
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:28,727
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

528
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,900
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

529
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,909
but if we had green
lights all the way,

530
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,569
we could do it in 1 4 minutes.

531
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,807
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

532
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,083
Whoa.

533
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,921
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

534
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,855
Lyle?

535
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,757
Lyle?

536
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,652
I'll see what I can do.

537
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,969
You're right on time.

538
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,039
All these poor bastards
out there,

539
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,873
putting their life
savings in banks,

540
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,880
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

541
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,212
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

542
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:15,046
they can depend
on the government?

543
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,380
I don't think so.

544
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:17,817
Are you taping me?

545
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,549
Of course not.

546
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,284
I never tape you--
come look,

547
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,450
see for yourself.

548
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,056
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

549
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:31,623
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

550
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,795
Like my cousin Mashkov

551
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,965
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby--

552
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,032
gold."

553
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:49,243
Every time I look
at these engravings...

554
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:52,083
She's so beautiful.

555
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:54,248
Where'd you say you got these?

556
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:55,450
I didn't.

557
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,356
A little walking around money.

558
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,578
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

559
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,613
I'm... sorry.

560
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,147
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

561
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,115
-That wasn't the agreement.
-What can I say?

562
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:21,445
I'm just middleman.

563
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:23,782
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

564
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,321
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

565
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,467
So, what does a man

566
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,502
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

567
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,766
He watches his big-ass TV.

568
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,338
That's our in.

569
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:13,968
Stella.

570
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:15,937
Jesus!

571
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,769
Charlie!

572
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:19,274
How did you get in here?

573
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:20,810
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

574
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,311
What-- so you just
let yourself in?

575
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,608
I was just making sure
you were okay.

576
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:25,978
I apologize. I just...

577
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,881
-l...
-Don't look.

578
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,521
Okay.

579
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:38,926
You got a lot of stuff here.

580
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,897
You know,
your dad was old school.

581
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:43,865
Did the whole thing by touch.

582
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,959
That worked for him;
this works for me.

583
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,005
T echnology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

584
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:51,563
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

585
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,144
Why the headphones?

586
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,975
Just training myself.

587
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,675
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

588
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:04,347
What do you want, Charlie?

589
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:07,247
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

590
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,985
and we need to send in
a repairman.

591
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,425
T o get your video blueprint
of the interior.

592
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:12,926
Yep.

593
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,692
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

594
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,161
Except me.

595
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:23,999
I'll do it, Charlie.

596
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,510
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

597
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,044
All right.

598
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,603
I'll set it up.

599
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:32,773
Okay.

600
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,339
Um... you, um...

601
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,010
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

602
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,110
before I go back to my room?

603
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:43,125
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

604
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,252
Just get it all done tonight.

605
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:46,955
Yeah.

606
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,190
Sorry I scared you.

607
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,267
It's okay.

608
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,925
Good night.

609
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,800
Bye.

610
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,465
And then he's just...
the media darling.

611
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,133
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

612
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,404
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

613
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,409
You know what he said?

614
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,877
He said he...
he named it Napster

615
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,175
because it-it was his nickname,

616
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:07,239
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

617
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,410
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

618
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,420
when he stole it from me!

619
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,080
He didn't even graduate.

620
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:17,092
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

621
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,092
They shut him down.

622
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:21,130
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

623
00:43:22,165 --> 00:43:23,325
Here... here we go.

624
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,799
Cable chick.

625
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:37,437
Becky.

626
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,106
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

627
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,114
the other one.

628
00:43:40,183 --> 00:43:41,445
And it's such a mystery

629
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,349
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

630
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,945
So, all we need is a...

631
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:47,284
service truck like that one,

632
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,348
a work shirt like hers.

633
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,758
You think Stella
can pull it off?

634
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:53,295
I have my doubts.

635
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:55,490
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

636
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:59,464
You think he's...

637
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,970
mixing business with pleasure?

638
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,268
He should know better.

639
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,968
Only I'm allowed to do that.

640
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,405
Right. Where you going?

641
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,778
T o get a work shirt
and a service truck.

642
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:23,523
Are you kidding me?

643
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:29,723
How does he do that?

644
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:30,766
How do you do that?

645
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,062
What are you saying?

646
00:44:32,135 --> 00:44:33,568
Hey, how are you?

647
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,036
Oh, good. I'm good.

648
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,938
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

649
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,339
And you are...?

650
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:40,774
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

651
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,209
but it's written on my shirt.

652
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,271
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

653
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:46,838
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

654
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,112
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

655
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,676
If it's on the menu.

656
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,278
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

657
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:54,152
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

658
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,124
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

659
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,125
No.

660
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,388
Perfect.

661
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:46,263
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

662
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,598
The cable's out.

663
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,104
The TV, the modem, everything.

664
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:51,436
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

665
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,044
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

666
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,515
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

667
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:03,211
just gone out--
our modem, everything.

668
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,878
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

669
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:06,945
I have a Thursday
between 9::00 and 3:00

670
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:08,115
if that would be good.

671
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:09,715
That's going to work. Thank you.

672
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,421
Guard just called
the cable company.

673
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,824
What time's the appointment?

674
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,833
Thursday between 9::00 and 3:00.

675
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:28,075
Hello?

676
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:29,509
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

677
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:30,910
I understand your service
is out,

678
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,675
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

679
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,681
Yes.

680
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,012
Well, we have
a technician working

681
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,643
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

682
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,652
earlier than expected.

683
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,245
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

684
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:40,584
Sure, that'd be great.

685
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,057
All right, our technician
will see you then.

686
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,093
Have a nice day.

687
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:47,258
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

688
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,265
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

689
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,801
Let's check out the camera.

690
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:58,904
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

691
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:02,342
Make sure you walk slowly,

692
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,845
or the image will streak.

693
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:04,845
-Ow.
-Ooh.

694
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:06,404
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

695
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,174
Sorry... Couldn't pin

696
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:10,719
the corsage
on my prom date either.

697
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:11,719
But you had a prom date?

698
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,915
It was his cousin.

699
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,514
There's cable lines

700
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,389
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

701
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,291
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

702
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:21,762
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

703
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,858
Okay.

704
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,561
Just want you to know

705
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:27,796
I think you're very
brave going in there.

706
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:28,803
I know it won't be easy.

707
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,635
I second that.

708
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:34,371
It's going to be fine.

709
00:48:35,678 --> 00:48:37,236
What?

710
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:39,304
You know what fine stands for?

711
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:40,371
Freaked Out. Insecure...

712
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,544
Neurotic, and Emotional.

713
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,552
You'll be great.

714
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,760
Yeah.

715
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:03,703
Morning.

716
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:05,001
Can I see some l.D.?

717
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,679
Thanks for coming so soon.

718
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,220
Hey, that's part of the job.

719
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,778
All right.

720
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:53,021
Aston Martin Vanquish.

721
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:56,820
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

722
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,293
Nasty-ass dogs.

723
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:05,095
Hey! Hey!

724
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,032
Relax,

725
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:14,235
Jesus Christ.

726
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,540
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

727
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,741
Come on.

728
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:22,944
House.

729
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,987
Go on, get out of here.

730
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,118
It's okay,

731
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,856
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

732
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,529
Steve Frazelli.

733
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,602
Becky.

734
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,608
Want to show me that problem?

735
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,303
Yeah, of course.

736
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,606
This way.

737
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,477
You have a really nice house.

738
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,813
Yeah. 1 922.

739
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:57,478
All the original tiles.

740
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,146
Every stone in that courtyard

741
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,952
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

742
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,424
What a tactic.

743
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,790
Monastery?

744
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,193
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

745
00:51:07,263 --> 00:51:09,857
You don't seem impressed.

746
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,265
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

747
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,929
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

748
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:17,268
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

749
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,604
What does do it for you?

750
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,941
Um... TVs?

751
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,741
I have a monster TV.

752
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,009
Not working right now, but...

753
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,778
But you know, I should
probably check out

754
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,443
the cable modem, you know.

755
00:51:30,553 --> 00:51:31,952
Yeah? Yeah, right.

756
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:33,488
Over here.

757
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:38,959
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

758
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:40,461
One day, it just goes out.

759
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,159
I ought to have him strung up.

760
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:47,901
Here we go.

761
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:48,938
There's our baby.

762
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,463
We got him.

763
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,372
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

764
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,001
There's no wiring in here.

765
00:51:58,214 --> 00:51:59,306
Just right here?

766
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,314
Yeah.

767
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,180
Look at that, that's my...

768
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:04,082
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

769
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:06,087
That's my stereo.

770
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:07,645
I bet most of your customers

771
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,954
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

772
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,584
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

773
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,855
Oh, yeah.

774
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,794
He's hitting on her.

775
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:15,956
There's no problem here.

776
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,659
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

777
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:20,999
Okay.

778
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,273
You know what,
end this shit right now.

779
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,273
I'm going to blow this shit

780
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:27,775
right off the mountain
right now.

781
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,812
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,250
I see you got the AVM processor.

783
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,116
Only the best.

784
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:40,155
Check the box.

785
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,689
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

786
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,633
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

787
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,337
That should do it.

788
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,304
It's fixed?

789
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:58,806
Turn her on, let's see.

790
00:52:58,875 --> 00:52:59,967
Now.

791
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,036
Japan's Nikkei index...

792
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:05,580
Perfect.

793
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:07,908
...was the ending price

794
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,747
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

795
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,253
Becky, huh?

796
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:15,222
Have we met before?

797
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,418
...a loss of 1. 1 percent
on the...

798
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:19,256
No, I don't think so.

799
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:20,761
If you can just sign there.

800
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,156
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

801
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:25,894
would I be the first
one of your customers

802
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:27,094
to ever do that?

803
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,196
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

804
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,264
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

805
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,433
had a handlebar mustache.

806
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:34,601
You know, not really my type.

807
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:37,168
I don't think it's a good idea.

808
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:39,441
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

809
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:42,278
No, actually, it's just my rule.

810
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:44,046
I don't go out
with strange men.

811
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,055
I just met you five minutes ago.

812
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,557
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

813
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,456
till we get to know each other
well enough.

814
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:55,220
Have a nice day.

815
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,232
Come on,

816
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,699
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

817
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,292
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

818
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:01,393
I'll just... I'll meet you.

819
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,962
Anywhere you want to go.

820
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,976
Come on, break your rule once.

821
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,774
It's just dinner.

822
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:18,309
Is that a yes?

823
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,925
Are you okay?

824
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,434
Yeah.

825
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,630
He touched my hand.

826
00:54:37,673 --> 00:54:40,471
He came on to me.

827
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,280
Hey, at least l...

828
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,942
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

829
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:52,783
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

830
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:54,618
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

831
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,453
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

832
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,357
Yeah.

833
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,054
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

834
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:04,065
Hey, Lyle,

835
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:06,397
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

836
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,731
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

837
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,238
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

838
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,500
Lyle!

839
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,804
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

840
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:15,070
No.

841
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:17,271
I'm not calling you The Napster.

842
00:55:17,346 --> 00:55:18,574
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

843
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,580
Well, I am.

844
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,549
And him, Handsome Rob.

845
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:23,175
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

846
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,720
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

847
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:28,059
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

848
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:30,298
Why are you encouraging this?

849
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,135
It is a verifiable fact--

850
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:34,607
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

851
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:36,440
I am The Napster.

852
00:55:37,513 --> 00:55:40,346
All right, all right.

853
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:41,610
What is the distance

854
00:55:41,684 --> 00:55:44,517
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

855
00:55:46,288 --> 00:55:48,654
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

856
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,715
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

857
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:52,624
from the vault
to the getaway car?

858
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:55,220
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

859
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:01,960
Six feet.

860
00:56:19,555 --> 00:56:21,079
Okay, you've got your gold.

861
00:56:42,745 --> 00:56:43,905
Whoo!

862
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,108
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

863
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:25,483
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

864
00:57:25,554 --> 00:57:27,488
with the custom work, too.

865
00:57:27,556 --> 00:57:28,887
I know a man for the job.

866
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:31,926
So I modified the camera
to include the...

867
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,758
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

868
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,888
Who's that?

869
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,829
Rob's mechanic friend.

870
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:43,766
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

871
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,500
Charlie, this is Wrench.

872
00:57:45,574 --> 00:57:47,041
Hey, what's up, man?

873
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:48,804
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

874
00:57:48,877 --> 00:57:50,344
We need some body work done.

875
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:54,815
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

876
00:57:54,883 --> 00:57:56,180
with enough suspension
and horsepower

877
00:57:56,251 --> 00:57:58,276
to outrun anything chasing us.

878
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,116
2,700 pounds of what?

879
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:02,419
Of whatever.

880
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,585
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

881
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:08,095
1 0,000.

882
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:11,760
All right.

883
00:58:22,244 --> 00:58:24,235
What comes around...

884
00:58:37,826 --> 00:58:40,158
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

885
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:42,094
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

886
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:43,688
Wrench.

887
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,663
Ham and cheese.

888
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,396
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

889
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,563
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

890
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:54,769
What comes around

891
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:59,303
Just comes around

892
00:59:15,063 --> 00:59:15,961
What comes around

893
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:20,298
What comes around...

894
00:59:36,048 --> 00:59:37,310
You want all greens?

895
00:59:37,383 --> 00:59:38,714
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

896
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,843
What have you got?

897
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,252
Welcome to L.A.'s
Automated Traffic Surveillance

898
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:45,415
and Control Operations Center.

899
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:47,254
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

900
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:48,554
and specifically designed
algorithms

901
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,288
to predict traffic conditions,

902
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:52,023
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

903
00:59:52,097 --> 00:59:54,031
all I did was come up
with my own

904
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:56,499
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

905
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:58,264
and now we own the place.

906
00:59:58,337 --> 00:59:59,304
You want to do a dry run?

907
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:01,066
I thought you'd never ask.

908
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:04,141
See, red light?

909
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,177
Green light.

910
01:00:10,783 --> 01:00:11,807
-Danielson?
-Yeah?

911
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:12,873
What's up with Grid 34?

912
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,852
Let's check it out.

913
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,319
Hey, hey.

914
01:00:16,388 --> 01:00:18,219
Oh, oops, did l...?

915
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:20,758
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

916
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,726
-Can you change it back now?
-Yeah.

917
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:29,399
Lights are working fine.

918
01:00:29,468 --> 01:00:31,766
Just an accident.

919
01:00:33,072 --> 01:00:34,039
That's good.

920
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:37,269
What are those?

921
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,208
Unnecessary engine parts.

922
01:00:39,278 --> 01:00:42,975
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

923
01:00:43,048 --> 01:00:45,915
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

924
01:00:45,985 --> 01:00:47,077
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

925
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,311
And never getting lost

926
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:49,854
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

927
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:51,617
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

928
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,624
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

929
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:54,920
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

930
01:00:54,994 --> 01:00:56,621
And never getting lost

931
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,322
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

932
01:00:58,397 --> 01:01:00,524
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

933
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,965
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

934
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:05,595
Won't stop driving
till it's over

935
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,772
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

936
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:14,278
Won't stop driving
till it's over

937
01:01:14,346 --> 01:01:16,041
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

938
01:01:16,115 --> 01:01:17,446
And never getting lost

939
01:01:17,516 --> 01:01:19,040
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

940
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:21,551
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

941
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,418
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

942
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:31,060
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

943
01:01:31,163 --> 01:01:33,461
The look on Steve's face.

944
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,342
You're early.

945
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:47,038
I'm in a hurry.

946
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:51,173
Of course, you know
that the Florida

947
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,445
vote rigging was a ClA
and mob operation.

948
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:54,451
Is that so?

949
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,748
Yeah, which is not
so very different

950
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:57,015
from when your John F. Kennedy

951
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:59,785
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

952
01:01:59,858 --> 01:02:01,382
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

953
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,985
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

954
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:05,894
You Americans.

955
01:02:05,964 --> 01:02:07,659
You love your heroes.

956
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:10,600
A holiday for Columbus?

957
01:02:10,669 --> 01:02:12,534
He makes the wrong turn,

958
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:15,038
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

959
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,334
And you know
what he was looking for?

960
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:18,035
I bet you're going to tell me.

961
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:19,201
Gold.

962
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,041
Supposedly for Queen lsabella,

963
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,909
but don't think that
the Medicis back in ltaly

964
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:24,471
didn't want a part
of that action.

965
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,780
And what did ltaly
need gold for?

966
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:31,186
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

967
01:02:31,256 --> 01:02:32,518
Venice...
that's where

968
01:02:32,591 --> 01:02:34,525
these bricks...

969
01:02:39,765 --> 01:02:40,789
You were saying something?

970
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:42,356
Nothing... No...

971
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:43,560
No, you were really
on a roll there.

972
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,000
Don't stop. I'm interested.

973
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,970
Please, I'm confused,
my English--

974
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:50,273
You understand fine.

975
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:51,570
Now what do you know
about my gold?

976
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,575
No, I don't--

977
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,737
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

978
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,805
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

979
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:00,374
about a heist in Venice.

980
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:02,716
35 million in bricks,

981
01:03:02,788 --> 01:03:05,120
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

982
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,680
-Who have you told?
-No one.

983
01:03:06,759 --> 01:03:07,691
Who have you told?

984
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,728
No one!
I swear to God!

985
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,856
You swear to God?

986
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:15,365
You crazy?
I swear to God.

987
01:03:15,434 --> 01:03:16,401
I didn't!

988
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:19,198
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

989
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:50,567
Yevhen?

990
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:54,261
Yevhen?

991
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,450
Let's putt it this time...

992
01:04:13,592 --> 01:04:15,787
Putt, not drive.

993
01:04:15,861 --> 01:04:17,158
Very good.

994
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:18,491
If you can just get it,

995
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:20,498
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

996
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:21,828
Much better.

997
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,925
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

998
01:04:24,002 --> 01:04:25,264
Yeah, he's over there.

999
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:26,895
Thanks, man.

1000
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:30,807
-Don't stare.
-Huh?

1001
01:04:30,876 --> 01:04:31,934
Don't stare.

1002
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:33,341
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

1003
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:34,379
Stare at what?

1004
01:04:35,714 --> 01:04:36,976
That was good.
That was good.

1005
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:38,641
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

1006
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:42,045
That was great.

1007
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,815
-Skinny Pete.
-Yo, Charlie.

1008
01:04:43,889 --> 01:04:45,049
What's up, man?

1009
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:46,452
How's it going?

1010
01:04:46,525 --> 01:04:49,050
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

1011
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:51,026
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

1012
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,360
some supplies.

1013
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:54,364
Baby, go relax.

1014
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,365
Baby...

1015
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:56,799
Go relax.

1016
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:03,866
Yo.

1017
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,910
Yo.

1018
01:05:05,978 --> 01:05:07,605
Supplies.

1019
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:08,509
What's wrong?

1020
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,672
Huh?

1021
01:05:09,748 --> 01:05:12,376
Uh... um, some, uh,

1022
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:13,577
some nitromin,

1023
01:05:13,652 --> 01:05:15,313
uh...

1024
01:05:15,387 --> 01:05:16,820
some, uh...

1025
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:19,119
some nitromin, primer...

1026
01:05:19,191 --> 01:05:20,556
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

1027
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:21,024
Yo.

1028
01:05:21,093 --> 01:05:22,185
Uh, nothing.

1029
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:23,193
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

1030
01:05:23,262 --> 01:05:24,889
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

1031
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,897
Nitromin, primer,

1032
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:28,227
-detonating cord...
-Right, right.

1033
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,359
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

1034
01:05:30,435 --> 01:05:33,199
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

1035
01:05:33,272 --> 01:05:35,001
All right.

1036
01:05:40,879 --> 01:05:42,574
Cost you about five G's.

1037
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,616
Done. Call me.

1038
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:47,341
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

1039
01:05:47,419 --> 01:05:49,216
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

1040
01:05:49,288 --> 01:05:51,085
-Peace.
-Come on.

1041
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,537
Get out.

1042
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,370
There.

1043
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,383
Vance has something
to tell you.

1044
01:06:26,758 --> 01:06:27,884
Go on.

1045
01:06:30,596 --> 01:06:32,257
A couple weeks back...

1046
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,493
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

1047
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:39,264
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

1048
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,135
dancer on them.

1049
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,639
What did you tell him?

1050
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:46,704
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

1051
01:06:51,783 --> 01:06:53,808
I'm sorry.

1052
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,611
What did this man look like?

1053
01:06:58,857 --> 01:06:59,824
He had, uh...

1054
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,256
Iong black hair,

1055
01:07:01,326 --> 01:07:03,317
big tattoo on his neck.

1056
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:08,928
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

1057
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:10,298
I know that guy.

1058
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,425
Baby, go relax.

1059
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,168
Do you know who I am?

1060
01:07:54,246 --> 01:07:55,713
You're Mashkov.

1061
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,681
That's right.

1062
01:07:57,749 --> 01:08:00,377
You were asking
about gold bricks

1063
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,113
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

1064
01:08:03,155 --> 01:08:04,645
T ell me why.

1065
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,295
Steve just called to confirm

1066
01:08:13,365 --> 01:08:15,333
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

1067
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,765
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

1068
01:08:16,835 --> 01:08:19,599
Gas the guards,
doors open 8: 1 5.

1069
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:21,639
Safe popped by 8:25.

1070
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:24,107
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

1071
01:08:24,176 --> 01:08:25,700
Straight to Union Station.

1072
01:08:25,777 --> 01:08:27,108
Only green lights on your route.

1073
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:28,339
The rest of the city's red.

1074
01:08:28,413 --> 01:08:30,005
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

1075
01:08:30,115 --> 01:08:31,139
Train leaves at 1 0::00.

1076
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:33,411
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9::30.

1077
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:35,476
Timing's got to be dead on.

1078
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:36,816
Let's get ready.

1079
01:08:36,888 --> 01:08:38,321
Let's get it.

1080
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:11,983
Wow, that is a nice car.

1081
01:09:12,124 --> 01:09:13,785
Sorry, Rob.

1082
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,053
Coast is clear, guys.

1083
01:09:26,938 --> 01:09:27,870
This is it, guys.

1084
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:28,906
Moment of truth.

1085
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:31,735
What the hell is this?

1086
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,910
Shit!

1087
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:37,972
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

1088
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,978
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

1089
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:44,851
No.

1090
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,293
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

1091
01:09:49,361 --> 01:09:51,022
T oo many witnesses.

1092
01:09:51,129 --> 01:09:52,153
Stella.

1093
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,926
I know, I know.

1094
01:09:56,701 --> 01:09:58,601
I'm late for my date.

1095
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:01,332
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

1096
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,033
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

1097
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:04,403
Sorry.

1098
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:07,070
Let's get out of the street.

1099
01:10:10,982 --> 01:10:12,973
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

1100
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:14,746
What's that supposed to mean?

1101
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,378
Well, you don't really seem

1102
01:10:16,454 --> 01:10:20,220
Iike the adventurous type,
you know?

1103
01:10:20,292 --> 01:10:23,591
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

1104
01:10:23,662 --> 01:10:26,790
I wasn't making assumptions.

1105
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:28,264
I've made some
assumptions about you.

1106
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:31,029
Oh, really?

1107
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,160
And?

1108
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:37,432
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

1109
01:10:43,381 --> 01:10:45,576
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

1110
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:46,844
Let's go back to my place.

1111
01:10:46,918 --> 01:10:47,885
No assumptions...

1112
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,477
Not tonight.
It's late.

1113
01:10:49,554 --> 01:10:50,521
I should go home.

1114
01:10:50,589 --> 01:10:53,615
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

1115
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:54,659
No,

1116
01:10:54,726 --> 01:10:58,093
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

1117
01:10:58,163 --> 01:10:59,357
Hey.

1118
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:01,626
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

1119
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,430
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation--

1120
01:11:04,502 --> 01:11:05,526
you still don't trust me?

1121
01:11:05,604 --> 01:11:09,370
Oh, I trust everyone.

1122
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:12,740
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

1123
01:11:17,215 --> 01:11:18,978
It's an interesting saying.

1124
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,415
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

1125
01:11:21,953 --> 01:11:22,885
Can't remember.

1126
01:11:22,954 --> 01:11:24,478
Really?

1127
01:11:24,556 --> 01:11:26,717
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

1128
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:27,883
Really?

1129
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:30,359
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

1130
01:11:30,428 --> 01:11:32,419
He said it all the time.

1131
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:33,623
His name was John Bridger.

1132
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,332
You're hurting my wrist.

1133
01:11:37,402 --> 01:11:39,768
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

1134
01:11:43,475 --> 01:11:45,943
Let go of my wrist.

1135
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,945
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

1136
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:51,176
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

1137
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:53,911
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

1138
01:11:53,985 --> 01:11:55,850
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

1139
01:11:58,556 --> 01:12:00,786
Who are you working with?

1140
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,191
She's with us.

1141
01:12:18,977 --> 01:12:20,205
Gang's all here.

1142
01:12:20,278 --> 01:12:23,042
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

1143
01:12:23,114 --> 01:12:24,672
A coward.

1144
01:12:24,749 --> 01:12:25,773
Then you should have seen

1145
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,511
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

1146
01:12:31,156 --> 01:12:32,145
It's not worth it.

1147
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,315
Put a leash on your cat.

1148
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:39,919
Hi, Steve.

1149
01:12:39,998 --> 01:12:41,260
Charlie.

1150
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:44,899
Not bad, Charlie.

1151
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:45,959
Really, not bad.

1152
01:12:46,037 --> 01:12:48,164
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

1153
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,968
not to reach across
this table and kill you

1154
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,406
with my bare hands.

1155
01:12:51,476 --> 01:12:52,943
You know better than that,
Charlie.

1156
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:55,502
Can't let emotion
into these things.

1157
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,672
T ell me it wasn't about emotion

1158
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,409
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

1159
01:12:58,483 --> 01:13:00,212
That wasn't about emotion.

1160
01:13:00,285 --> 01:13:02,515
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

1161
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,452
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

1162
01:13:04,522 --> 01:13:07,013
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

1163
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:08,683
'cause I just don't give a shit.

1164
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,227
Okay?

1165
01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:12,957
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

1166
01:13:13,031 --> 01:13:15,499
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

1167
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:17,296
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

1168
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:19,132
that's fine with me.

1169
01:13:19,204 --> 01:13:23,436
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

1170
01:13:23,508 --> 01:13:25,408
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

1171
01:13:25,477 --> 01:13:28,412
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

1172
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,415
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

1173
01:13:31,483 --> 01:13:33,781
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

1174
01:13:33,852 --> 01:13:35,149
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

1175
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:38,053
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

1176
01:13:38,156 --> 01:13:39,987
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

1177
01:13:40,058 --> 01:13:42,026
come in and try
to crack my safe?

1178
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:45,426
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

1179
01:13:45,497 --> 01:13:47,055
but I just don't see it.

1180
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:48,497
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

1181
01:13:48,566 --> 01:13:50,227
Same old Steve, huh?

1182
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,633
Always thinking defensively.

1183
01:13:52,704 --> 01:13:54,399
That's why you're
always number two.

1184
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,531
How do you figure that?

1185
01:13:56,608 --> 01:13:58,075
You got no imagination.

1186
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:00,475
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

1187
01:14:00,545 --> 01:14:02,570
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

1188
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,013
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

1189
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:06,175
That gold is already gone.

1190
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:07,912
That's bullshit, Steve.

1191
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:09,920
No, really, it's over Charlie.

1192
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:11,922
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

1193
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,584
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

1194
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,718
I mean, really, be my guest.

1195
01:14:16,795 --> 01:14:18,524
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

1196
01:14:18,596 --> 01:14:19,722
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

1197
01:14:19,798 --> 01:14:20,730
you had going for you.

1198
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,858
You just blew the element
of surprise.

1199
01:14:26,805 --> 01:14:28,102
Surprised?

1200
01:14:31,476 --> 01:14:32,534
It's over when I say it's over.

1201
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,539
Are you all right, sir?

1202
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,473
How you doing?

1203
01:15:13,685 --> 01:15:16,449
Good...

1204
01:15:16,521 --> 01:15:19,251
considering...

1205
01:15:19,324 --> 01:15:21,690
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

1206
01:15:21,759 --> 01:15:23,021
for a man I barely knew.

1207
01:15:30,301 --> 01:15:35,364
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

1208
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,876
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

1209
01:15:38,943 --> 01:15:40,911
that he was on some job,

1210
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:44,540
I knew you were right there
with him.

1211
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:50,381
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

1212
01:15:52,457 --> 01:15:54,254
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

1213
01:15:54,325 --> 01:15:55,986
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

1214
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,426
Be nice if it was true.

1215
01:15:58,496 --> 01:15:59,758
It is true.

1216
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:01,731
He always regretted
not having been

1217
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:03,790
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

1218
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:08,104
How do you know that?

1219
01:16:08,173 --> 01:16:10,573
Because he told me.

1220
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:18,476
What did you do to your hand?

1221
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,809
I punched Steve.

1222
01:16:23,888 --> 01:16:27,153
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

1223
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:31,593
Those hands are
way too valuable.

1224
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:40,936
Hey.

1225
01:16:46,544 --> 01:16:48,409
Okay?

1226
01:16:57,121 --> 01:16:58,748
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

1227
01:17:05,263 --> 01:17:08,255
T ell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

1228
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,527
Charlie!

1229
01:17:12,203 --> 01:17:13,261
He's flying the coop.

1230
01:17:14,572 --> 01:17:15,732
When?

1231
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:17,274
His security guard called

1232
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:19,503
for a private helicopter
at 4::00 PM.

1233
01:17:19,577 --> 01:17:22,171
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5::00.

1234
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:26,013
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1235
01:17:26,084 --> 01:17:27,016
to Mexico City.

1236
01:17:27,085 --> 01:17:30,521
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

1237
01:17:30,588 --> 01:17:32,283
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

1238
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:34,416
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

1239
01:17:34,492 --> 01:17:35,618
It's going to be in that truck

1240
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,921
and he's going to be watching it

1241
01:17:36,995 --> 01:17:38,690
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

1242
01:17:38,763 --> 01:17:40,492
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1243
01:17:40,565 --> 01:17:41,532
Who knows where?

1244
01:17:41,599 --> 01:17:42,691
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

1245
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:43,699
Slow down, slow down.

1246
01:17:43,768 --> 01:17:44,632
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

1247
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:45,726
This is good news for us.

1248
01:17:45,803 --> 01:17:48,033
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

1249
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:49,936
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

1250
01:17:50,008 --> 01:17:51,202
now the safe is coming to us.

1251
01:17:51,276 --> 01:17:52,607
We're going to boost it
in transit.

1252
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:53,609
Charlie, it could take

1253
01:17:53,678 --> 01:17:54,804
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

1254
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,574
We have no idea which one.

1255
01:17:56,648 --> 01:17:58,878
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

1256
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:59,917
We're already set up to do it.

1257
01:17:59,984 --> 01:18:01,383
Napster,

1258
01:18:01,452 --> 01:18:05,479
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

1259
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,751
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

1260
01:18:07,825 --> 01:18:08,985
Where do we want it to go?

1261
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:11,618
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

1262
01:18:11,696 --> 01:18:14,096
We do it like the ltalian job.

1263
01:18:20,305 --> 01:18:21,294
Hello?

1264
01:18:21,372 --> 01:18:22,634
Why'd you do it?

1265
01:18:22,707 --> 01:18:23,537
Do what?

1266
01:18:23,608 --> 01:18:24,336
Yevhen.

1267
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:26,104
You didn't have to clip him.

1268
01:18:26,177 --> 01:18:27,144
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

1269
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:28,143
We didn't clip anybody.

1270
01:18:28,212 --> 01:18:29,236
Yevhen's cousin is under

1271
01:18:29,314 --> 01:18:31,976
the distinct impression
that you did.

1272
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,108
Why does he think that?

1273
01:18:33,184 --> 01:18:34,344
Because you want to know

1274
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,353
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

1275
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:37,683
You told him that?

1276
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:39,017
Listen to me, man.

1277
01:18:39,157 --> 01:18:40,920
If there's one thing that I know

1278
01:18:40,992 --> 01:18:42,960
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

1279
01:18:43,027 --> 01:18:45,587
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1280
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:49,224
Look, I need a favor.

1281
01:19:15,259 --> 01:19:16,317
Yeah.

1282
01:19:16,394 --> 01:19:17,486
Had a hiccup last night.

1283
01:19:17,562 --> 01:19:18,494
Could use some help.

1284
01:19:18,563 --> 01:19:19,655
Want hands-on this time.

1285
01:19:19,731 --> 01:19:20,993
You interested?

1286
01:19:21,065 --> 01:19:21,997
Could be.

1287
01:19:22,066 --> 01:19:24,296
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

1288
01:19:24,369 --> 01:19:26,735
If I'm in, I'm in.

1289
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,965
Okay, you're in.

1290
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,268
All right.

1291
01:19:33,077 --> 01:19:34,476
What do you think, Charlie?

1292
01:19:34,545 --> 01:19:35,534
This'll work.

1293
01:19:35,613 --> 01:19:37,080
Let's go.

1294
01:19:47,959 --> 01:19:49,358
You're amazing.

1295
01:19:49,427 --> 01:19:50,826
It's a work of genius.

1296
01:19:50,895 --> 01:19:51,862
Uh-huh.

1297
01:20:00,605 --> 01:20:02,573
You okay?

1298
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,572
Just give me a moment.

1299
01:20:03,641 --> 01:20:04,767
Now?

1300
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:08,005
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

1301
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:10,047
and if the brass touches
the sides,

1302
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:12,672
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

1303
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,351
T ake all the time you need.

1304
01:20:20,425 --> 01:20:21,983
Hey, Charlie.

1305
01:20:22,059 --> 01:20:25,051
What?

1306
01:20:25,163 --> 01:20:28,530
I love you, man.

1307
01:20:28,599 --> 01:20:30,897
I love you, too.

1308
01:20:33,438 --> 01:20:36,532
Okay.
Okay.

1309
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:48,714
Your attention, please.

1310
01:20:48,786 --> 01:20:50,617
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

1311
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,451
in approximately 1 5 minutes.

1312
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:10,965
Check positions.

1313
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:12,031
Napster?

1314
01:21:12,143 --> 01:21:14,976
I'm in position.

1315
01:21:15,046 --> 01:21:16,570
Handsome Rob?

1316
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:17,841
We're in position.

1317
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,940
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

1318
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:25,011
Wrench?

1319
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:26,750
Set.

1320
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:44,668
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

1321
01:21:44,742 --> 01:21:47,404
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1322
01:21:47,478 --> 01:21:48,445
We'll deal with it.

1323
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:56,547
Who are these cats?

1324
01:21:56,621 --> 01:21:57,679
What's wrong?

1325
01:21:57,755 --> 01:21:59,723
Charlie, you won't believe this.

1326
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,849
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

1327
01:22:01,926 --> 01:22:05,487
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

1328
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:07,292
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

1329
01:22:07,365 --> 01:22:09,196
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

1330
01:22:09,267 --> 01:22:11,030
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

1331
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:14,400
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1332
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:16,531
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

1333
01:22:27,852 --> 01:22:29,547
Okay, let's go!

1334
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,611
Moving out!

1335
01:22:44,268 --> 01:22:45,860
Here we go.

1336
01:22:45,937 --> 01:22:47,564
They're pulling out.

1337
01:22:47,638 --> 01:22:49,265
Napster,

1338
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,241
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1339
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:55,040
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1340
01:22:58,082 --> 01:23:00,778
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

1341
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,046
See which one's riding low.

1342
01:23:13,998 --> 01:23:15,431
First one is...

1343
01:23:17,902 --> 01:23:19,631
First two are the same, so...

1344
01:23:23,841 --> 01:23:26,708
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 1 28.

1345
01:23:35,586 --> 01:23:37,611
We're moving out.

1346
01:23:39,123 --> 01:23:40,988
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

1347
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,286
we're heading to the airport.

1348
01:23:56,874 --> 01:24:00,833
Okay, guys, truck 1 28
has turned right heading west.

1349
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,606
Gridlock time.

1350
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:07,810
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

1351
01:24:07,885 --> 01:24:09,750
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

1352
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:13,690
We've crashed.

1353
01:24:15,493 --> 01:24:17,427
It's not a crash.

1354
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:19,995
We've got power.

1355
01:24:21,065 --> 01:24:22,862
I can't log in.

1356
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:27,336
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

1357
01:24:34,245 --> 01:24:35,212
Oops.

1358
01:24:39,717 --> 01:24:42,982
You'll... never... shut down...

1359
01:24:43,054 --> 01:24:45,818
the real... Napster.

1360
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:54,896
What's your problem?!

1361
01:25:01,238 --> 01:25:03,138
Truck 1 28,
what is your progress?

1362
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:04,970
This is truck 1 28.

1363
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:06,805
Traffic's out of control here.

1364
01:25:06,877 --> 01:25:08,811
We've got to look
for another route.

1365
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:12,246
Check the police band.

1366
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,250
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

1367
01:25:18,589 --> 01:25:19,988
Oh, get us out of here.

1368
01:25:20,057 --> 01:25:21,149
I'm trying.

1369
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:28,157
And he's taking it.

1370
01:25:33,804 --> 01:25:35,533
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1371
01:25:35,606 --> 01:25:36,595
at Traffic Control Center.

1372
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:39,734
Nice, Charlie.

1373
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:42,040
What are you up to?

1374
01:25:42,113 --> 01:25:44,377
Go back.

1375
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,788
I now command you to turn left.

1376
01:25:56,761 --> 01:25:58,251
Come on, take the left.

1377
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:01,762
Yeah, you did.

1378
01:26:01,832 --> 01:26:03,390
You did.

1379
01:26:37,935 --> 01:26:39,266
Give us the flag.

1380
01:26:39,336 --> 01:26:41,327
Metro just passed through
the station.

1381
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,430
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1382
01:26:43,507 --> 01:26:44,633
Go.

1383
01:27:00,825 --> 01:27:01,484
Come on, Steve.

1384
01:27:18,509 --> 01:27:19,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1385
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:26,310
Look out!
Look out!

1386
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:27,350
30 seconds and counting.

1387
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:36,256
1 5 seconds,
you're either blocked in

1388
01:27:36,327 --> 01:27:37,453
or you're paint on the train.

1389
01:27:43,434 --> 01:27:44,401
Go, go, come on, come on!

1390
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:47,193
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

1391
01:27:54,245 --> 01:27:55,678
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1392
01:27:55,746 --> 01:27:57,680
You're gonna stop right there.

1393
01:28:36,086 --> 01:28:37,553
Okay, guys.

1394
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:39,020
Coming into position.

1395
01:28:39,123 --> 01:28:40,420
Stay cool.

1396
01:28:52,469 --> 01:28:53,800
T en...

1397
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,930
nine...

1398
01:28:56,006 --> 01:28:57,735
eight...

1399
01:28:57,808 --> 01:28:59,537
seven...

1400
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,941
six...

1401
01:29:01,011 --> 01:29:02,638
five...

1402
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:04,408
four...

1403
01:29:04,481 --> 01:29:05,243
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

1404
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:06,749
-don't lose them.
-three...

1405
01:29:06,817 --> 01:29:08,751
two...

1406
01:29:08,819 --> 01:29:10,480
one.

1407
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:33,668
Damn.

1408
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:41,475
Where's my truck?

1409
01:29:41,552 --> 01:29:44,077
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

1410
01:29:48,525 --> 01:29:50,425
It just blew right through
the street.

1411
01:29:50,494 --> 01:29:51,927
Well, get under there.

1412
01:30:02,673 --> 01:30:05,369
We have another problem, guys.

1413
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,238
What?

1414
01:30:07,378 --> 01:30:09,209
This isn't the Worthington 1 000.

1415
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:10,143
What?

1416
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:13,040
He switched safes on us.

1417
01:30:14,518 --> 01:30:15,712
Can you do it?

1418
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,151
It's lsraeli made.

1419
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:18,848
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1420
01:30:18,922 --> 01:30:21,049
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

1421
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:22,853
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1422
01:30:22,926 --> 01:30:24,791
steel rods snap into place

1423
01:30:24,862 --> 01:30:26,022
and you can't open the safe.

1424
01:30:26,096 --> 01:30:27,791
And then we're up shit creek.

1425
01:30:57,127 --> 01:31:00,654
I think I just
cracked the glass.

1426
01:31:01,832 --> 01:31:03,732
I don't think it broke though.

1427
01:31:03,801 --> 01:31:06,599
I can't drill it again.

1428
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,195
I have to do it by touch.

1429
01:31:11,608 --> 01:31:12,768
I can't get through.

1430
01:31:12,843 --> 01:31:14,367
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1431
01:31:14,445 --> 01:31:16,310
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

1432
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,347
1 1th and Fig.

1433
01:31:17,414 --> 01:31:19,041
Positions two and three,

1434
01:31:19,116 --> 01:31:20,913
meet at 1 1th and Figueroa
and double back

1435
01:31:20,984 --> 01:31:22,042
to Hollywood and Highland.

1436
01:31:22,119 --> 01:31:23,711
Hurry up!

1437
01:31:38,435 --> 01:31:40,403
Your attention please.

1438
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:42,462
Baggage for train number 22

1439
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,769
is now available
at carousel number four.

1440
01:31:44,842 --> 01:31:47,743
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1441
01:31:47,811 --> 01:31:49,540
at carousel number four.

1442
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:24,914
I can't do this, Charlie.

1443
01:32:24,982 --> 01:32:25,914
Stella...

1444
01:32:25,983 --> 01:32:27,041
I can't do it--
I need a drill,

1445
01:32:27,184 --> 01:32:28,344
a borescope, something.

1446
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,783
-I need to...
-You don't need any of that.

1447
01:32:29,853 --> 01:32:31,184
Come on, Charlie.

1448
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:33,416
Hey, you can do this.

1449
01:33:28,545 --> 01:33:29,739
Slide.

1450
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,110
Come on, come on.

1451
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,178
Hey.

1452
01:33:39,256 --> 01:33:42,419
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

1453
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:43,584
Absolutely.

1454
01:33:46,897 --> 01:33:48,387
Napster.

1455
01:33:48,465 --> 01:33:49,397
Yeah?

1456
01:33:49,466 --> 01:33:51,491
1 3 across, four high, four deep.

1457
01:33:53,136 --> 01:33:55,570
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

1458
01:33:55,639 --> 01:33:56,799
How much?

1459
01:33:56,873 --> 01:33:59,239
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

1460
01:34:02,713 --> 01:34:04,180
2.7... 2.7 million.

1461
01:34:04,248 --> 01:34:04,976
What?

1462
01:34:06,049 --> 01:34:07,175
No, it's 27.

1463
01:34:07,251 --> 01:34:08,616
That's 27 million.

1464
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:10,619
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

1465
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:17,984
Yeah!

1466
01:34:18,061 --> 01:34:21,963
Got the... holy spirit.

1467
01:34:22,032 --> 01:34:24,466
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

1468
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:03,205
What did you think, John?

1469
01:35:11,348 --> 01:35:12,872
27 million.

1470
01:35:12,949 --> 01:35:14,382
Say it again.

1471
01:35:14,451 --> 01:35:16,749
-27 million.
-Say it again.

1472
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,754
-Say it again!
-27 million.

1473
01:35:18,822 --> 01:35:19,982
Say it again!

1474
01:35:43,513 --> 01:35:45,208
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1475
01:35:48,552 --> 01:35:50,213
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

1476
01:35:50,287 --> 01:35:51,845
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

1477
01:35:51,922 --> 01:35:53,514
Stop them before they get
to the street.

1478
01:35:58,528 --> 01:35:59,552
Shit!

1479
01:36:03,834 --> 01:36:04,425
Whoa!

1480
01:36:18,715 --> 01:36:19,579
Here we go.

1481
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:29,450
Whoo!

1482
01:36:31,561 --> 01:36:32,084
Whoa! Whoa!

1483
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:35,422
Open your door.

1484
01:36:40,771 --> 01:36:42,864
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1485
01:36:48,078 --> 01:36:49,545
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

1486
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:01,817
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

1487
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,746
Come on!

1488
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:39,757
Where you going?
Where you going?

1489
01:37:59,182 --> 01:38:00,046
I'm going to take Steve.

1490
01:38:00,116 --> 01:38:01,208
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

1491
01:38:01,284 --> 01:38:02,478
I'll meet you there.

1492
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,278
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

1493
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:15,823
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

1494
01:38:19,336 --> 01:38:20,997
I know it's you, Charlie.

1495
01:38:23,006 --> 01:38:23,995
T ake your next left.

1496
01:39:23,733 --> 01:39:25,030
Nice move, Steve.

1497
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,498
Get out!

1498
01:40:04,574 --> 01:40:06,405
-Get out!
-Okay.

1499
01:40:06,476 --> 01:40:08,000
I said get out!

1500
01:41:42,839 --> 01:41:43,771
They got a bunch of cars

1501
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,432
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

1502
01:41:45,508 --> 01:41:47,499
Look, look, man...

1503
01:41:47,577 --> 01:41:49,977
-I don't know anything...
-Hey, don't worry about them.

1504
01:41:50,046 --> 01:41:52,446
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

1505
01:41:56,953 --> 01:41:59,319
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

1506
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,621
Come on.

1507
01:42:11,401 --> 01:42:13,460
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

1508
01:42:18,408 --> 01:42:20,535
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

1509
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:23,841
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

1510
01:42:23,913 --> 01:42:26,541
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

1511
01:42:26,616 --> 01:42:27,810
The helicopter routine,

1512
01:42:27,884 --> 01:42:29,647
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

1513
01:42:29,719 --> 01:42:33,314
But now I've got the gold--
and you, you've got nothing.

1514
01:42:33,389 --> 01:42:34,151
I got this.

1515
01:42:34,224 --> 01:42:35,418
So cut the crap,

1516
01:42:35,492 --> 01:42:37,187
and give me my goddamn gold!

1517
01:42:51,274 --> 01:42:53,208
Who the hell are you?

1518
01:42:53,276 --> 01:42:55,073
I am Mashkov...

1519
01:42:55,178 --> 01:42:57,078
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1520
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:59,114
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

1521
01:43:08,591 --> 01:43:10,252
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

1522
01:43:10,326 --> 01:43:12,351
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1523
01:43:12,428 --> 01:43:13,588
a lot of unsavory people.

1524
01:43:13,663 --> 01:43:15,324
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

1525
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:17,389
You are right...

1526
01:43:17,467 --> 01:43:19,401
no imagination.

1527
01:43:22,205 --> 01:43:23,763
There's a lot of gold in there.

1528
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,364
We're the only ones with guns.

1529
01:43:25,441 --> 01:43:26,840
I'll make you a good deal.

1530
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:36,783
I've already made my deal.

1531
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:43,456
What do you want?

1532
01:43:43,526 --> 01:43:45,790
You know this was
never about the gold.

1533
01:43:45,862 --> 01:43:48,023
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

1534
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:54,062
Bitch!

1535
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,865
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1536
01:43:57,473 --> 01:43:58,599
Okay.

1537
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:03,307
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1538
01:44:03,379 --> 01:44:04,971
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

1539
01:44:05,048 --> 01:44:05,980
Just don't shoot me.

1540
01:44:06,049 --> 01:44:08,210
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

1541
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:11,276
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1542
01:44:11,354 --> 01:44:13,185
I think you would be
very interested

1543
01:44:13,256 --> 01:44:14,848
in some of the machinery I use.

1544
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,727
No, come on.

1545
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,358
Guys.

1546
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:27,562
I want to make a toast.

1547
01:44:27,637 --> 01:44:29,036
T o John Bridger,

1548
01:44:29,105 --> 01:44:31,767
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

1549
01:44:31,841 --> 01:44:33,775
Father and friend.

1550
01:44:33,843 --> 01:44:34,867
T o my dad.

1551
01:44:39,849 --> 01:44:41,043
Stella was right.

1552
01:44:41,117 --> 01:44:42,584
It wasn't about the money.

1553
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:44,142
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

1554
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,551
from having a little bit of fun.

1555
01:44:45,622 --> 01:44:47,556
Money!

1556
01:44:47,624 --> 01:44:50,058
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

1557
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:54,596
Get a good job with good pay...

1558
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:56,894
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

1559
01:44:59,135 --> 01:45:05,506
Money, it's a gas

1560
01:45:05,575 --> 01:45:10,774
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

1561
01:45:10,847 --> 01:45:12,337
He got off with a warning.

1562
01:45:12,415 --> 01:45:16,010
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

1563
01:45:16,085 --> 01:45:18,645
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

1564
01:45:18,721 --> 01:45:21,690
with a room just for his shoes.

1565
01:45:21,758 --> 01:45:22,816
Buenos dias.

1566
01:45:22,892 --> 01:45:26,020
Buenos dias.

1567
01:45:26,095 --> 01:45:30,225
Money, get back

1568
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:32,700
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

1569
01:45:32,769 --> 01:45:37,229
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack

1570
01:45:37,307 --> 01:45:38,399
Are you really the Napster?

1571
01:45:38,474 --> 01:45:39,839
Money!

1572
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:41,035
Yes, I am.

1573
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:43,044
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1574
01:45:43,179 --> 01:45:47,240
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

1575
01:45:47,317 --> 01:45:48,443
With speakers so loud

1576
01:45:48,518 --> 01:45:50,713
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

1577
01:45:50,787 --> 01:45:54,245
I'm in the high-fidelity...

1578
01:45:54,324 --> 01:45:55,450
If you would.

1579
01:45:55,525 --> 01:45:57,049
...first class traveling set

1580
01:45:57,126 --> 01:46:02,530
And I think I need a Lear jet

1581
01:46:11,274 --> 01:46:13,003
And me?

1582
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:16,011
I took John Bridger's advice.

1583
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:19,344
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

1584
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:21,007
and I'm gonna hold on
to her forever.

1585
01:47:24,614 --> 01:47:27,014
Money!

1586
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:30,678
It's a crime

1587
01:47:30,753 --> 01:47:37,886
Share it fairly, but don't
take a slice of my pie

1588
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:44,229
Money, so they say

1589
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:51,365
Is the root of all evil today

1590
01:47:51,441 --> 01:47:56,242
But if you ask for a raise
it's no surprise

1591
01:47:56,312 --> 01:47:59,748
They're giving none away

1592
01:47:59,816 --> 01:48:01,841
Away... away...

1593
01:48:01,918 --> 01:48:02,850
Away...

1594
01:48:02,919 --> 01:48:06,320
Away... away...

1595
01:48:06,389 --> 01:48:07,321
Away...

1596
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:09,654
Away... away...

1597
01:48:09,725 --> 01:48:10,657
Away...

1598
01:48:10,726 --> 01:48:12,660
Away... away...

1599
01:48:12,728 --> 01:48:13,660
Away...

1600
01:48:13,729 --> 01:48:15,663
Away... away...

1601
01:48:15,731 --> 01:48:16,663
Away...

1602
01:48:16,732 --> 01:48:18,666
Away... away...

1603
01:48:18,734 --> 01:48:19,666
Away...

1604
01:48:19,735 --> 01:48:21,669
Away... away...

1605
01:48:21,737 --> 01:48:22,669
Away...

1606
01:48:22,738 --> 01:48:24,672
Away... away...

1607
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:25,672
Away...

1608
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:27,675
Away... away...

1609
01:48:27,743 --> 01:48:28,675
Away...

1610
01:48:28,744 --> 01:48:37,379
Away... away...
