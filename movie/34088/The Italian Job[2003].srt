1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,280
Hello.

2
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,240
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,000
Daddy.

4
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
It's early.

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,880
Yeah, I know.

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,400
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,000
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

8
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,160
No,

9
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,960
but it's sparkly.

10
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,120
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

12
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
Why don't you just come by?

13
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
Well, it'd be a long trip.

15
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,880
I'm in Venice.

16
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,080
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

17
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,320
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

18
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
but we never really connected.

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,120
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

20
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,760
What are you into, Dad?

21
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,920
Don't break my heart.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
You told me you were through.

23
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,240
After this I am, I swear to you.

24
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,600
Is Charlie there?

25
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,640
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
I love you.

28
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,360
Go back to sleep. Bye.

29
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,800
D... Dad?

30
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,840
I love you, too.

31
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,640
I sent it.

32
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,200
You're supposed
to do your shopping

33
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,440
after we pull off the job.

34
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,640
I feel so optimistic.

35
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
So?

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,280
How do you feel?

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm fine.

38
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,040
Fine?

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah, unfortunately.

41
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
"Freaked out."

42
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

44
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,440
See those columns behind you?

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
What about them?

46
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,440
That's where they used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,400
who felt "fine."

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
Well... after you.

49
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,200
For after the haul.

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,880
Hope I get to fire it up.

51
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,480
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,640
No.

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,600
If they're no-shows,

54
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,960
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,160
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,680
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

60
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,320
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,280
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

63
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,400
Now, you told me ten,

64
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,280
and you said I would have five.

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,000
When?

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,720
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
- I will kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
Come on, take your best shot.

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,400
Come on.

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,760
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Come on.

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,040
Let's go.

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,440
What is it this time?

74
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,840
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,040
Engineer. Painter.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah, fascinating.

77
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,440
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,080
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,600
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,880
Can we go? Please?

81
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,280
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,720
Come along,
make yourself useful.

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
Untie that line.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,080
Today.

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,200
Yeah.

86
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
Yeah, Gilligan.

87
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
If you don't mind.

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,040
- We set?
- Yeah. I've enhanced

89
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,680
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,800
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

93
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,800
We're in Italy.

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,040
Speak English.

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,760
Steve, how we looking?

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Papa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is empty.

97
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,400
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,560
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,280
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,600
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
They'll be there.

103
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,120
You can trust these guys.

104
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,440
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,760
I trust everyone... I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,920
We're in.

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,880
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,360
They will be.

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,080
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,720
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,920
This is our only shot at it.

114
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
Charlie?

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,080
Keep going?

116
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,000
It's up to you, kid.

117
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,920
It's a go.

118
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,480
Okay, Steve.

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,240
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

120
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
Got it.

121
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,120
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

122
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,680
from the north wall.

123
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,400
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

124
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
Got it.

125
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Well, it's right above you.

126
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,720
Now, paint.

127
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,960
Two feet, nine inches wide.

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,240
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

130
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

131
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
Yeah.

132
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Bene.

133
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,640
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,040
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,680
The police boat's
heading your way.

136
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,280
Seven minutes and counting.

137
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,560
Let's go.

138
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,840
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

139
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Whoa! Whoa!

140
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,200
Hey, you guys. Come here.

141
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,360
I want to propose a toast.

142
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,280
To us.

143
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,280
Yay!

144
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,000
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

145
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,360
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

146
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
without even holding a gun

147
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,840
because he planned this
down to a "T."

148
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,080
Nobody else
could have done that.

149
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Nobody. Charlie!

150
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,840
- Charlie!
- Yay!

151
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,560
Thank you.

152
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,840
So, come on, gentlemen.

153
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,560
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

154
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Spare no dirty details.

155
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
Come on, you guys.

156
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,320
Take a lesson from an old man.

157
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,040
Don't spend it.
Invest.

158
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,720
In what?

159
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,600
In gold.

160
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,800
Let's figure out

161
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,920
how to get out of here first,
all right?

162
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
What are you getting, Rob?

163
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
I don't know...
there's a lot of things

164
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,400
you can buy with a lot of money.

165
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

166
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
in leather seats.

167
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,800
Obviously. See?

168
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,960
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

169
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

170
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,240
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

171
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,920
I'm going to get a NAD T770

172
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,680
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

173
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,560
Yeah.

174
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,680
It's a big stereo.

175
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,840
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

176
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
Now you're talking.

177
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,960
$35 million... you can't get
more creative than that, man?

178
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,120
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

179
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,600
right there.

180
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,160
Get me a big house...

181
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,760
get me a library
full of first editions.

182
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,080
Get a room for my shoes.

183
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,040
What about you, Steve?

184
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
I don't know...
I haven't decided yet.

185
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,160
You haven't decided yet?

186
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,040
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

187
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,000
I liked what you said.

188
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
I'll take one of each of yours.

189
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,640
Well, well, two of everything

190
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
- For Steve then.
- Two of those.

191
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Oy!

192
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Loved the toast.

193
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,080
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

194
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
No, you were incredible.

195
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,840
Just incredible.

196
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,280
You saw the whole picture.

197
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,560
You covered all the angles.

198
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,280
You know, Charlie,

199
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,320
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

200
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,880
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

201
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,720
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

202
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,640
Don't be the latter.

203
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,720
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

204
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,480
in this life.

205
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,880
What are you talking about,
John?

206
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,320
You've been a good father.

207
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,840
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

208
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,320
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

209
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,160
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,040
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

211
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
and hold onto her forever.

212
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,080
- Okay?
- Hey.

213
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,120
Let's go...
I'm freezing my ass off.

214
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,360
Yeah.

215
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,280
Steve's getting cold.

216
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,720
You, too?

217
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm all right.

218
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,400
I love you, kid.

219
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,800
You did really great.

220
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,240
Thanks, John.

221
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,560
Let's go.

222
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
Money

223
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a gas

224
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,920
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

225
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,320
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

226
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,120
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

227
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,760
He was like Don Johnson.

228
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,760
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

229
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

230
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,520
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

231
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,040
What's this, what's this?

232
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,840
Who the hell are these guys?

233
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,120
Hey!

234
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,240
Take your hands off the wheel.

235
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,920
Steve!

236
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,040
Don't even think about it...
just do it.

237
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
No, no, no, no,

238
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
- No, no, no, no, John.
- Steve,

239
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,200
what the hell are you doing?

240
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,560
Made a few plans of my own.

241
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,000
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

242
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,960
You know that.

243
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,200
I think that's probably right,
John.

244
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,760
Go! Go!

245
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,760
Charlie.

246
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,680
We got to go, Charlie.

247
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,640
You always work in the dark?

248
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,280
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

249
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,440
Not bad.

250
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,120
Not bad, Stella.

251
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

252
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,160
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

253
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,120
who to call first.

254
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,120
You're expensive, Stella.

255
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,800
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

256
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,560
Good will, community service.

257
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,640
I do it for the money, Paul.

258
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
I'll be sending you a bill.

259
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,920
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

260
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
I never look inside.

261
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,520
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

262
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Hi, Stella.

263
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,440
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

264
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,560
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

265
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

266
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,880
Time, time for this girl
to sing

267
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,560
Damn if I thought
that you would change

268
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,680
And my life would stay
the same

269
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,080
Things will come
and things will go

270
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,360
And one thing I know
for sure

271
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,240
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

272
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm walking out the door

273
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,000
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

274
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,760
Oh, it's time...

275
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,040
How long to crack it?

276
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,400
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

277
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,360
Oh! You're the man.

278
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,360
What's on the lineup?

279
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,520
Todd Milliken called.

280
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,040
He has a prototype
combination lock.

281
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,400
He wants you to test out.

282
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,560
He says he added

283
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,480
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

284
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,240
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

285
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
give him a thrill.

286
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,600
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

287
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,760
Says you two know each other.

288
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,320
Charlie Croker.

289
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,880
Hey, Stella.

290
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,640
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

291
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,160
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

292
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,600
right in front of your eyes,

293
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,440
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

294
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,600
We found him, Stella.

295
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
He's in Los Angeles.

296
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
The gold bricks he stole from us

297
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,760
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

298
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
I just got word,

299
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,360
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

300
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,680
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

301
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,320
Yeah?

302
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
Well, how do you know it's him?

303
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,320
Skinny Pete sent me this.

304
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,480
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

305
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Why you telling me
all of this?

306
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,280
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

307
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,840
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

308
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,320
delivered to his home office.

309
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,760
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

310
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,360
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

311
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,360
No, you don't.

312
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,320
The problem now is no one

313
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,600
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

314
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
And I need somebody
I can trust.

315
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

316
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,560
I'm not a thief.

317
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,440
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

318
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,680
John was like a father
to me, too.

319
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,360
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

320
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,280
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

321
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
I've moved on.

322
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,720
Come on, Charlie.

323
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,720
Come on.

324
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
Hello?

325
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,480
I want to see the look
on that man's face

326
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,840
when his gold is gone.

327
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,960
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

328
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,200
She's in.

329
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,840
That's a good thing?

330
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,920
It's a very good thing.

331
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,760
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

332
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

333
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
a good idea, Charlie.

334
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
She's got the skill

335
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
and she's got the motivation.

336
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,920
Exactly.

337
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,160
She's emotional.

338
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,360
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

339
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

340
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
We're all emotional on this one.

341
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,560
Let's go.

342
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,080
Are you ready?

343
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,200
Of course I am.

344
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
You're not ready.

345
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,880
That was quick.

346
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Where are they?

347
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,160
We're a little early.

348
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

349
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
There.

350
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
That's Lyle.

351
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,600
He's my computer genius.

352
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,760
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

353
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,160
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

354
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

355
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,080
and stole his idea.

356
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,360
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

357
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,920
Hey.

358
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,880
Oh...

359
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,440
You okay?

360
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,160
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

361
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,240
That's Left Ear.

362
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
Demolition and explosives.

363
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,160
When he was ten,

364
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,080
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

365
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,640
Fire...

366
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,360
Whoa.

367
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
Yeah, that was cool.

368
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,680
How'd you do that?

369
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
What?!

370
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,040
How'd you do that?

371
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,080
What?!

372
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,400
I said,
how did you do that?

373
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,760
What?!

374
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,400
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

375
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,560
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

376
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,000
Handsome Rob.

377
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Premier wheel man.

378
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

379
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,400
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

380
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,000
- You're a heartbreaker...
- You know, he got 110

381
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,400
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

382
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,000
from women
who saw him on the news?

383
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,120
You're a heartbreaker

384
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,640
Dream-maker

385
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
Love-taker

386
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

387
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
And you?

388
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
I never heard
how you got your start.

389
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,120
Me?

390
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,760
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

391
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,760
Okay, you both know what to do.

392
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
Cough it up, now!

393
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,960
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

394
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,880
One, two, three, baby...

395
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,840
Watch it, spaz!

396
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,520
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

397
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,520
Hey, what's your problem, man?

398
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,960
A-B-C, it's easy

399
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
As one, two, three...

400
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,640
Hey, Charlie.

401
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,800
Good to see you, man.

402
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,000
- Looking good.
- Yeah?

403
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,360
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

404
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,320
Hello, Charlie.

405
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
Rob, what's up?
Good?

406
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,440
Guys...

407
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,560
Stella Bridger.

408
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,760
Hi.

409
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,720
How you doing?

410
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,880
Nice to meet you.

411
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
Phones?

412
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,160
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

413
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,600
I got internal chips in them.

414
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,720
Please change them twice a day.

415
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,440
We will get heat on line.

416
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,640
I.D. s?

417
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
"James Hymen?"

418
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,560
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

419
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,720
140 pounds? Try 165.

420
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Try lifting some weights.

421
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,440
- Try lifting up these.
- Guys, enough.

422
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,880
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

423
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,840
Let's go.

424
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,960
Hey, Charlie...

425
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,920
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

426
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

427
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,520
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

428
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,000
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

429
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,800
No, no

430
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,240
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

431
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
And you can't go wrong

432
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,240
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

433
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,680
California soul

434
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,320
Ooh-ooh-ooh

435
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,200
California soul...

436
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

437
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,520
this joker picked Hollywood.

438
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,760
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

439
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,240
All right...

440
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,000
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

441
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,760
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

442
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,840
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

443
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,360
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

444
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,800
I crack into the phone company's

445
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,560
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

446
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,600
there's a legal tap on the line.

447
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,600
Just reroute the digital copies

448
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,080
of the calls to our own
listening post.

449
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,440
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

450
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,920
How long?

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,560
No... how long will it take?

452
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,080
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

453
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

454
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,640
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

456
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,320
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

457
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,760
Five minutes flat.

458
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,240
Don't be cocky, young lady.

459
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,320
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

460
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,200
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

461
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

462
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
whole different ball game.

463
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,160
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

464
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,920
Look, just remember,

465
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
this is all the easy part, okay?

466
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,280
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

467
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,440
So what's the sketch?

468
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,480
We drive to Union Station.

469
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,240
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

470
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,840
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

471
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,880
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

472
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,760
Oh, great.

473
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,120
Carson Security System.

474
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,960
How good is it?

475
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,640
Carson's held
an annual contest...

476
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,160
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

477
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,640
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

478
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,720
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

479
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,280
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

480
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,600
It's an anti-scaling fence.

481
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,560
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

482
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,520
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

483
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,640
with some nitromin.

484
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,920
Security on the property?

485
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,320
Got an armed guard here.

486
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,320
Little rent-a-cop,

487
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,760
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

488
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,200
But that booth...

489
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,080
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

490
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,440
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

491
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,560
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

492
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

493
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,720
Shit.

494
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,440
This dude got dogs.

495
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,200
I don't do dogs.

496
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,680
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

497
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
What happened?

498
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,080
I had a bad experience.

499
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,840
Damn it. I'm deaf.

500
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,520
You turn in your badge

501
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,600
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

502
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,880
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

503
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,800
Crush.

504
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,840
I don't want to see you

505
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,000
anywhere near
this investigation.

506
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,800
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

507
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,760
I don't want to see you

508
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,320
anywhere near
this investigation.

509
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,520
Hey! It's a green!

510
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,080
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

511
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,880
- Green!
- I don't want to see you

512
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,640
anywhere near this...

513
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,120
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

514
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,440
Unbelievable.

515
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,520
There he is.

516
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,040
Let's get to work.

517
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,240
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

518
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,680
slit-your-wrist traffic.

519
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,880
You know, five people died
from smoking

520
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,200
in between traffic lights today.

521
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,120
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

522
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,440
You could always use that.

523
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,600
That'd be ideal

524
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,520
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

525
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,640
What's your guesstimate?

526
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,080
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

527
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,120
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

528
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,040
but if we had green
lights all the way,

529
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,640
we could do it in 14 minutes.

530
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,800
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

531
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,880
Whoa.

532
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,520
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

533
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Lyle?

534
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,200
Lyle?

535
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,000
I'll see what I can do.

536
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,040
You're right on time.

537
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,840
All these poor bastards
out there,

538
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,600
putting their life
savings in banks,

539
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,520
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

540
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,760
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

541
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,520
they can depend
on the government?

542
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,800
I don't think so.

543
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,160
Are you taping me?

544
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,840
Of course not.

545
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,480
I never tape you...
come look,

546
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,600
see for yourself.

547
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

548
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,400
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

549
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,480
Like my cousin Mashkov

550
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,520
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby...

551
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,480
gold."

552
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Every time I look
at these engravings...

553
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,040
She's so beautiful.

554
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,120
Where'd you say you got these?

555
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,240
I didn't.

556
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,840
A little walking around money.

557
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,560
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

558
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,560
I'm... sorry.

559
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,040
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

560
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,920
- That wasn't the agreement.
- What can I say?

561
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,200
I'm just middleman.

562
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,440
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

563
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,920
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

564
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,560
So, what does a man

565
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,440
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

566
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,520
He watches his big-ass TV.

567
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,880
That's our in.

568
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,560
Stella.

569
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,440
Jesus!

570
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
Charlie!

571
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,640
How did you get in here?

572
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,120
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

573
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,520
What... so you just
let yourself in?

574
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,760
I was just making sure
you were okay.

575
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,080
I apologize. I just...

576
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,840
- I...
- Don't look.

577
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,280
Okay.

578
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,480
You got a lot of stuff here.

579
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,320
You know,
your dad was old school.

580
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
Did the whole thing by touch.

581
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,240
That worked for him;
this works for me.

582
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,160
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

583
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,600
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

584
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,040
Why the headphones?

585
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,800
Just training myself.

586
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,400
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

587
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,880
What do you want, Charlie?

588
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,640
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

589
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,320
and we need to send in
a repairman.

590
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,640
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

591
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,080
Yep.

592
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,760
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

593
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,080
Except me.

594
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,720
I'll do it, Charlie.

595
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,080
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

596
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,520
All right.

597
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll set it up.

598
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Okay.

599
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,640
Um... you, um...

600
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,240
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

601
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,280
before I go back to my room?

602
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,040
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

603
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,080
Just get it all done tonight.

604
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Yeah.

605
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,920
Sorry I scared you.

606
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,920
It's okay.

607
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:05,960
|

608
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,480
Good night.

609
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,240
Bye.

610
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,800
And then he's just...
the media darling.

611
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

612
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,600
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

613
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,560
You know what he said?

614
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,960
He said he...
he named it Napster

615
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,200
because it-it was his nickname,

616
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,200
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

617
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

618
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,200
when he stole it from me!

619
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,760
He didn't even graduate.

620
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,640
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

621
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,600
They shut him down.

622
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,520
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

623
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,600
Here... here we go.

624
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,040
Cable chick.

625
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,160
Becky.

626
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,760
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

627
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,720
the other one.

628
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,000
And it's such a mystery

629
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,800
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

630
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,320
So, all we need is a...

631
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,600
service truck like that one,

632
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,560
a work shirt like hers.

633
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,880
You think Stella
can pull it off?

634
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,360
I have my doubts.

635
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,480
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

636
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,280
You think he's...

637
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,680
mixing business with pleasure?

638
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,880
He should know better.

639
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,520
Only I'm allowed to do that.

640
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,760
Right. Where you going?

641
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,040
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

642
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,360
Are you kidding me?

643
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,280
How does he do that?

644
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,280
How do you do that?

645
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,520
What are you saying?

646
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,960
Hey, how are you?

647
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,400
Oh, good. I'm good.

648
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,160
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

649
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,520
And you are...?

650
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,880
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

651
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,280
but it's written on my shirt.

652
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,200
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

653
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

654
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,880
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

655
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,400
If it's on the menu.

656
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

657
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,720
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

658
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

659
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,560
No.

660
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,800
Perfect.

661
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,240
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

662
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,520
The cable's out.

663
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,960
The TV, the modem, everything.

664
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,200
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

665
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,480
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

666
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,880
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

667
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,480
just gone out...
our modem, everything.

668
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,080
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

669
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,080
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

670
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,200
if that would be good.

671
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,720
That's going to work. Thank you.

672
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,320
Guard just called
the cable company.

673
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,600
What time's the appointment?

674
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,520
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

675
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,320
Hello?

676
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,720
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

677
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,040
I understand your service
is out,

678
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,760
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

679
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,720
Yes.

680
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,000
Well, we have
a technician working

681
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,560
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

682
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,520
earlier than expected.

683
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,040
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

684
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,320
Sure, that'd be great.

685
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,720
All right, our technician
will see you then.

686
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,720
Have a nice day.

687
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,720
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

688
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,600
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

689
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,040
Let's check out the camera.

690
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,920
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

691
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,200
Make sure you walk slowly,

692
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,640
or the image will streak.

693
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,600
- Ow.
- Ooh.

694
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,080
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

695
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,760
Sorry... Couldn't pin

696
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,240
the corsage
on my prom date either.

697
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,200
But you had a prom date?

698
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,320
It was his cousin.

699
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,840
There's cable lines

700
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,640
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

701
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,440
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

702
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,840
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

703
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Okay.

704
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,440
Just want you to know

705
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,600
I think you're very
brave going in there.

706
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,560
I know it won't be easy.

707
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,320
I second that.

708
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,920
It's going to be fine.

709
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,680
What?

710
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,640
You know what fine stands for?

711
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,680
Freaked Out. Insecure...

712
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,720
Neurotic, and Emotional.

713
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,480
You'll be great.

714
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,640
Yeah.

715
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,040
Morning.

716
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,280
Can I see some I.D.?

717
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,480
Thanks for coming so soon.

718
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,960
Hey, that's part of the job.

719
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,480
All right.

720
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,360
Aston Martin Vanquish.

721
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,000
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

722
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,240
Nasty-ass dogs.

723
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,920
Hey! Hey!

724
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Relax,

725
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,680
Jesus Christ.

726
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

727
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,960
Come on.

728
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,040
House.

729
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,000
Go on, get out of here.

730
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,880
It's okay,

731
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,520
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

732
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,000
Steve Frazelli.

733
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,920
Becky.

734
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,720
Want to show me that problem?

735
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,360
Yeah, of course.

736
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,600
This way.

737
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,360
You have a really nice house.

738
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,600
Yeah. 1922.

739
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,160
All the original tiles.

740
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,760
Every stone in that courtyard

741
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,440
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

742
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,880
What a tactic.

743
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,160
Monastery?

744
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,480
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

745
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,040
You don't seem impressed.

746
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,360
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

747
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,920
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

748
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,160
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

749
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,400
What does do it for you?

750
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,600
Um... TVs?

751
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,320
I have a monster TV.

752
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,480
Not working right now, but...

753
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,200
But you know, I should
probably check out

754
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,760
the cable modem, you know.

755
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,240
Yeah? Yeah, right.

756
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,680
Over here.

757
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,960
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

758
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,400
One day, it just goes out.

759
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,920
I ought to have him strung up.

760
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,520
Here we go.

761
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,520
There's our baby.

762
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,920
We got him.

763
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,760
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

764
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,320
There's no wiring in here.

765
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,440
Just right here?

766
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,440
Yeah.

767
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,200
Look at that, that's my...

768
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,040
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

769
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,960
That's my stereo.

770
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,440
I bet most of your customers

771
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,680
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

772
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,240
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

773
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,440
Oh, yeah.

774
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,320
He's hitting on her.

775
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,440
There's no problem here.

776
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,080
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

777
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,280
Okay.

778
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,360
You know what,
end this shit right now.

779
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,320
I'm going to blow this shit

780
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,760
right off the mountain
right now.

781
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,720
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,880
I see you got the AVM processor.

783
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,680
Only the best.

784
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,640
Check the box.

785
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,800
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

786
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,600
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

787
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,240
That should do it.

788
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:45,320
|

789
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,120
It's fixed?

790
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,520
Turn her on, let's see.

791
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,640
Now.

792
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,520
Japan's Nikkei index...

793
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,000
Perfect.

794
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,240
...was the ending price

795
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,000
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

796
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,400
Becky, huh?

797
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,280
Have we met before?

798
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,360
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

799
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,120
No, I don't think so.

800
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,560
If you can just sign there.

801
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,840
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

802
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,520
would I be the first
one of your customers

803
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,640
to ever do that?

804
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,640
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

805
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,600
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

806
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,720
had a handlebar mustache.

807
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,840
You know, not really my type.

808
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,320
I don't think it's a good idea.

809
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,480
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

810
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,200
No, actually, it's just my rule.

811
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,920
I don't go out
with strange men.

812
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,800
I just met you five minutes ago.

813
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,200
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

814
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,000
till we get to know each other
well enough.

815
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,640
Have a nice day.

816
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,560
Come on,

817
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,960
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

818
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,480
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

819
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
I'll just... I'll meet you.

820
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,000
Anywhere you want to go.

821
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,840
Come on, break your rule once.

822
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,560
It's just dinner.

823
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,760
Is that a yes?

824
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,880
Are you okay?

825
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,280
Yeah.

826
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,400
He touched my hand.

827
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,040
He came on to me.

828
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,640
Hey, at least I...

829
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,200
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

830
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,840
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

831
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,600
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

832
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,360
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

833
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,160
Yeah.

834
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,720
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

835
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,640
Hey, Lyle,

836
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,880
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

837
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,160
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

838
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,560
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

839
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,800
Lyle!

840
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,000
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

841
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,200
No.

842
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,320
I'm not calling you The Napster.

843
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,560
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

844
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,520
Well, I am.

845
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,400
And him, Handsome Rob.

846
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,960
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

847
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,400
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

848
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,840
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

849
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,000
Why are you encouraging this?

850
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,760
It is a verifiable fact...

851
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,120
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

852
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880
I am The Napster.

853
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,640
All right, all right.

854
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,840
What is the distance

855
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,640
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

856
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,600
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

857
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,600
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

858
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,400
from the vault
to the getaway car?

859
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,920
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

860
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,360
Six feet.

861
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,720
Okay, you've got your gold.

862
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,600
Whoo!

863
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,200
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

864
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,480
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

865
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,400
with the custom work, too.

866
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,720
I know a man for the job.

867
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,640
So I modified the camera
to include the...

868
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,360
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

869
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
Who's that?

870
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,320
Rob's mechanic friend.

871
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,000
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

872
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,680
Charlie, this is Wrench.

873
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,160
Hey, what's up, man?

874
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,840
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

875
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,320
We need some body work done.

876
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,600
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

877
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,920
with enough suspension
and horsepower

878
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,920
to outrun anything chasing us.

879
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,680
2,700 pounds of what?

880
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,880
Of whatever.

881
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,880
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

882
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,320
10,000.

883
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,840
All right.

884
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,800
What comes around...

885
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,080
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

886
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,960
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

887
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,480
Wrench.

888
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,320
Ham and cheese.

889
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,000
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

890
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,080
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

891
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,080
What comes around

892
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,440
Just comes around

893
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,440
What comes around

894
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,600
What comes around...

895
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,880
You want all greens?

896
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,240
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

897
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,280
What have you got?

898
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,600
Welcome to L.A. 's
Automated Traffic Surveillance

899
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,680
and Control Operations Center.

900
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,440
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

901
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,680
and specifically designed
algorithms

902
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,360
to predict traffic conditions,

903
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,000
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

904
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,920
all I did was come up
with my own

905
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,280
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

906
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,000
and now we own the place.

907
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,000
You want to do a dry run?

908
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,680
I thought you'd never ask.

909
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,640
See, red light?

910
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,640
Green light.

911
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,960
- Danielson?
- Yeah?

912
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,000
What's up with Grid 34?

913
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,920
Let's check it out.

914
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,320
Hey, hey.

915
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,120
Oh, oops, did I...?

916
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,560
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

917
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,440
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

918
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,840
Lights are working fine.

919
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,120
Just an accident.

920
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,320
That's good.

921
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,400
What are those?

922
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,240
Unnecessary engine parts.

923
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,880
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

924
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,680
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

925
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,800
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

926
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,000
And never getting lost

927
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,480
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

928
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,160
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

929
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,080
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

930
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,320
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

931
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,960
And never getting lost

932
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,600
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

933
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,720
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

934
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,040
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

935
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,560
Won't stop driving
till it's over

936
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,480
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

937
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,880
Won't stop driving
till it's over

938
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,600
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

939
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,920
And never getting lost

940
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,440
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

941
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,880
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

942
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,600
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

943
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,000
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

944
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,280
The look on Steve's face.

945
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,680
You're early.

946
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,320
I'm in a hurry.

947
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
Of course, you know
that the Florida

948
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,440
vote rigging was a CIA
and mob operation.

949
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,400
Is that so?

950
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,680
Yeah, which is not
so very different

951
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,880
from when your John F. Kennedy

952
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,520
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

953
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,080
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

954
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,560
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

955
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,400
You Americans.

956
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,080
You love your heroes.

957
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,920
A holiday for Columbus?

958
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,760
He makes the wrong turn,

959
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,160
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

960
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,400
And you know
what he was looking for?

961
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,040
I bet you're going to tell me.

962
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,160
Gold.

963
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,920
Supposedly for Queen Isabella,

964
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,720
but don't think that
the Medicis back in Italy

965
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,200
didn't want a part
of that action.

966
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,440
And what did Italy
need gold for?

967
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,640
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

968
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,920
Venice...
that's where

969
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,840
these bricks...

970
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,840
You were saying something?

971
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,360
Nothing... No...

972
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,520
No, you were really
on a roll there.

973
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,880
Don't stop. I'm interested.

974
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,800
Please, I'm confused,
my English...

975
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,960
You understand fine.

976
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,200
Now what do you know
about my gold?

977
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,160
No, I don't...

978
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

979
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,160
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

980
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,640
about a heist in Venice.

981
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,880
35 million in bricks,

982
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,200
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

983
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,680
- Who have you told?
- No one.

984
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,640
Who have you told?

985
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,600
No one!
I swear to God!

986
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,600
You swear to God?

987
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,000
You crazy?
I swear to God.

988
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,000
I didn't!

989
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,680
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

990
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,760
Yevhen?

991
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,320
Yevhen?

992
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,760
Let's putt it this time...

993
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,960
Putt, not drive.

994
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,280
Very good.

995
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,560
If you can just get it,

996
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,480
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

997
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,760
Much better.

998
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,760
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

999
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,040
Yeah, he's over there.

1000
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,600
Thanks, man.

1001
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,360
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

1002
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,440
Don't stare.

1003
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,800
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

1004
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,800
Stare at what?

1005
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,280
That was good.
That was good.

1006
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,880
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

1007
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,160
That was great.

1008
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,840
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

1009
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,040
What's up, man?

1010
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,360
How's it going?

1011
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,880
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

1012
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,760
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

1013
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,000
some supplies.

1014
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,960
Baby, go relax.

1015
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:16,920
Baby...

1016
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,280
Go relax.

1017
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,080
Yo.

1018
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,040
Yo.

1019
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,680
Supplies.

1020
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,520
What's wrong?

1021
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,640
Huh?

1022
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,240
Uh... um, some, uh,

1023
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,400
some nitromin,

1024
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,040
uh...

1025
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,480
some, uh...

1026
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,720
some nitromin, primer...

1027
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,080
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

1028
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:41,520
Yo.

1029
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,640
Uh, nothing.

1030
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,600
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

1031
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,240
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

1032
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,160
Nitromin, primer,

1033
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,440
- Detonating cord...
- Right, right.

1034
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,480
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

1035
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,200
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

1036
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,920
All right.

1037
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,200
Cost you about five G's.

1038
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,160
Done. Call me.

1039
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,760
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

1040
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,560
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

1041
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,360
- Peace.
- Come on.

1042
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,000
Get out.

1043
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,760
There.

1044
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,320
Vance has something
to tell you.

1045
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,640
Go on.

1046
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,840
A couple weeks back...

1047
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,920
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

1048
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,560
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

1049
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,360
dancer on them.

1050
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,800
What did you tell him?

1051
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,720
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

1052
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,520
I'm sorry.

1053
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,160
What did this man look like?

1054
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,280
He had, uh...

1055
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,640
long black hair,

1056
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,640
big tattoo on his neck.

1057
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,000
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

1058
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,320
I know that guy.

1059
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,240
Baby, go relax.

1060
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,440
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,880
You're Mashkov.

1062
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,760
That's right.

1063
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,360
You were asking
about gold bricks

1064
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,040
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

1065
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,440
Tell me why.

1066
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,760
Steve just called to confirm

1067
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,720
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

1068
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,080
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

1069
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,800
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

1070
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,760
Safe popped by 8:25.

1071
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,120
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

1072
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,640
Straight to Union Station.

1073
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,000
Only green lights on your route.

1074
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,160
The rest of the city's red.

1075
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,760
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

1076
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,840
Train leaves at 10:00.

1077
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,040
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

1078
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,000
Timing's got to be dead on.

1079
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,320
Let's get ready.

1080
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,760
Let's get it.

1081
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,040
Wow, that is a nice car.

1082
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,760
Sorry, Rob.

1083
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,960
Coast is clear, guys.

1084
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,280
This is it, guys.

1085
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,280
Moment of truth.

1086
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,960
What the hell is this?

1087
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,960
Shit!

1088
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,960
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

1089
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,760
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

1090
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,560
No.

1091
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,800
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

1092
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,480
Too many witnesses.

1093
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,560
Stella.

1094
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,200
I know, I know.

1095
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,720
I'm late for my date.

1096
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,360
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

1097
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,000
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

1098
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,320
Sorry.

1099
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,880
Let's get out of the street.

1100
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,520
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

1101
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,240
What's that supposed to mean?

1102
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,800
Well, you don't really seem

1103
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,480
like the adventurous type,
you know?

1104
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,720
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

1105
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,760
I wasn't making assumptions.

1106
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,200
I've made some
assumptions about you.

1107
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,840
Oh, really?

1108
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,920
And?

1109
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,960
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

1110
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,800
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

1111
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,000
Let's go back to my place.

1112
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,000
No assumptions...

1113
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,520
Not tonight.
It's late.

1114
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,520
I should go home.

1115
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,480
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

1116
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,520
No,

1117
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,800
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

1118
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,000
Hey.

1119
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,200
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

1120
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,880
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

1121
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,920
you still don't trust me?

1122
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,600
Oh, I trust everyone.

1123
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,840
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

1124
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,840
It's an interesting saying.

1125
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,200
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

1126
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,560
Can't remember.

1127
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,080
Really?

1128
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,240
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

1129
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,360
Really?

1130
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,720
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

1131
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,720
He said it all the time.

1132
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,880
His name was John Bridger.

1133
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,440
You're hurting my wrist.

1134
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,760
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

1135
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,680
Let go of my wrist.

1136
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,600
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

1137
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,720
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

1138
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,320
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

1139
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,200
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

1140
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,920
Who are you working with?

1141
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,080
She's with us.

1142
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,560
Gang's all here.

1143
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,280
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

1144
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,840
A coward.

1145
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,880
Then you should have seen

1146
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,560
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

1147
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,000
It's not worth it.

1148
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,120
Put a leash on your cat.

1149
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,440
Hi, Steve.

1150
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,720
Charlie.

1151
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,240
Not bad, Charlie.

1152
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,240
Really, not bad.

1153
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,360
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

1154
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,080
not to reach across
this table and kill you

1155
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,480
with my bare hands.

1156
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,920
You know better than that,
Charlie.

1157
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,400
Can't let emotion
into these things.

1158
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,520
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

1159
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,200
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

1160
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,920
That wasn't about emotion.

1161
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,120
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

1162
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,960
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

1163
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,440
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

1164
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,040
'cause I just don't give a shit.

1165
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,520
Okay?

1166
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,120
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

1167
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,560
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

1168
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,280
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

1169
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,040
that's fine with me.

1170
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,200
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

1171
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,080
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

1172
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,960
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

1173
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,840
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

1174
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,120
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

1175
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,400
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

1176
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,200
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

1177
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,040
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

1178
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,000
come in and try
to crack my safe?

1179
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,280
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

1180
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,840
but I just don't see it.

1181
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,200
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

1182
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,880
Same old Steve, huh?

1183
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,200
Always thinking defensively.

1184
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,880
That's why you're
always number two.

1185
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,920
How do you figure that?

1186
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,400
You got no imagination.

1187
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,720
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

1188
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,720
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

1189
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,040
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

1190
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,160
That gold is already gone.

1191
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,840
That's bullshit, Steve.

1192
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,760
No, really, it's over Charlie.

1193
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,680
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

1194
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,240
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

1195
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,280
I mean, really, be my guest.

1196
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,000
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

1197
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,160
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

1198
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,120
you had going for you.

1199
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,160
You just blew the element
of surprise.

1200
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,200
Surprised?

1201
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,440
It's over when I say it's over.

1202
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,200
Are you all right, sir?

1203
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,800
How you doing?

1204
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,560
Good...

1205
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,240
considering...

1206
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,600
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

1207
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,880
for a man I barely knew.

1208
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,720
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

1209
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,080
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

1210
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,040
that he was on some job,

1211
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,520
I knew you were right there
with him.

1212
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,120
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

1213
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,840
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

1214
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,480
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

1215
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,840
Be nice if it was true.

1216
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,120
It is true.

1217
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,000
He always regretted
not having been

1218
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,960
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

1219
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,120
How do you know that?

1220
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,480
Because he told me.

1221
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,040
What did you do to your hand?

1222
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,160
I punched Steve.

1223
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,360
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

1224
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,640
Those hands are
way too valuable.

1225
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,600
Hey.

1226
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,760
Okay?

1227
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,680
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

1228
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,800
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

1229
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,000
Charlie!

1230
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,600
He's flying the coop.

1231
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,960
When?

1232
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,440
His security guard called

1233
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,600
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

1234
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,160
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

1235
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,840
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1236
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,800
to Mexico City.

1237
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,160
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

1238
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,840
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

1239
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,880
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

1240
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,040
It's going to be in that truck

1241
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,280
and he's going to be watching it

1242
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,000
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

1243
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,720
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1244
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,720
Who knows where?

1245
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,800
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

1246
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,800
Slow down, slow down.

1247
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,680
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

1248
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,720
This is good news for us.

1249
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,960
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

1250
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,760
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

1251
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,000
now the safe is coming to us.

1252
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,320
We're going to boost it
in transit.

1253
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,280
Charlie, it could take

1254
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,440
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

1255
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,120
We have no idea which one.

1256
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,360
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

1257
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,360
We're already set up to do it.

1258
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,760
Napster,

1259
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,680
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

1260
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,840
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

1261
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,040
Where do we want it to go?

1262
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,560
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

1263
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,920
We do it like the Italian job.

1264
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,840
Hello?

1265
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,120
Why'd you do it?

1266
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,000
Do what?

1267
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,760
Yevhen.

1268
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,440
You didn't have to clip him.

1269
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,440
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

1270
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,400
We didn't clip anybody.

1271
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,440
Yevhen's cousin is under

1272
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,080
the distinct impression
that you did.

1273
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,160
Why does he think that?

1274
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,360
Because you want to know

1275
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,280
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

1276
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,560
You told him that?

1277
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,840
Listen to me, man.

1278
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,680
If there's one thing that I know

1279
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,640
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

1280
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,120
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1281
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,640
Look, I need a favor.

1282
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
Yeah.

1283
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,720
Had a hiccup last night.

1284
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,680
Could use some help.

1285
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,800
Want hands-on this time.

1286
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,080
You interested?

1287
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,040
Could be.

1288
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,280
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

1289
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,600
If I'm in, I'm in.

1290
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,760
Okay, you're in.

1291
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,000
All right.

1292
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,040
What do you think, Charlie?

1293
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,040
This'll work.

1294
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,520
Let's go.

1295
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,280
You're amazing.

1296
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,720
It's a work of genius.

1297
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,680
Uh-huh.

1298
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,960
You okay?

1299
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:47,920
Just give me a moment.

1300
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,080
Now?

1301
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,200
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

1302
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,120
and if the brass touches
the sides,

1303
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,640
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

1304
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,160
Take all the time you need.

1305
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,600
Hey, Charlie.

1306
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,520
What?

1307
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,880
I love you, man.

1308
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,120
I love you, too.

1309
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,560
Okay.
Okay.

1310
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,240
Your attention, please.

1311
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,040
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

1312
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,800
in approximately 15 minutes.

1313
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,560
Check positions.

1314
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,600
Napster?

1315
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,400
I'm in position.

1316
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,920
Handsome Rob?

1317
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,160
We're in position.

1318
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,160
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

1319
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,040
Wrench?

1320
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,720
Set.

1321
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,880
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

1322
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,520
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1323
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,520
We'll deal with it.

1324
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,280
Who are these cats?

1325
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,360
What's wrong?

1326
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,320
Charlie, you won't believe this.

1327
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,360
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

1328
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,840
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

1329
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,600
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

1330
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,400
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

1331
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,160
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

1332
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,400
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1333
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,440
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

1334
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,920
Okay, let's go!

1335
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,920
Moving out!

1336
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,560
Here we go.

1337
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,200
They're pulling out.

1338
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,840
Napster,

1339
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,680
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1340
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,360
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1341
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,880
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

1342
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,040
See which one's riding low.

1343
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,920
First one is...

1344
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,960
First two are the same, so...

1345
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,760
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

1346
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,200
We're moving out.

1347
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,440
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

1348
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,680
we're heading to the airport.

1349
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,480
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1350
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,160
Gridlock time.

1351
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,160
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

1352
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,040
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

1353
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,800
We've crashed.

1354
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,400
It's not a crash.

1355
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,840
We've got power.

1356
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,600
I can't log in.

1357
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,880
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

1358
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,440
Oops.

1359
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,880
You'll... never... shut down...

1360
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,600
the real... Napster.

1361
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,320
What's your problem?!

1362
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,240
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

1363
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,000
This is truck 128.

1364
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,760
Traffic's out of control here.

1365
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,680
We've got to look
for another route.

1366
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,960
Check the police band.

1367
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,880
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

1368
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,400
Oh, get us out of here.

1369
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,480
I'm trying.

1370
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,240
And he's taking it.

1371
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,280
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1372
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,320
at Traffic Control Center.

1373
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,320
Nice, Charlie.

1374
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,520
What are you up to?

1375
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,760
Go back.

1376
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,760
I now command you to turn left.

1377
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,080
Come on, take the left.

1378
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,440
Yeah, you did.

1379
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,000
You did.

1380
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,400
Give us the flag.

1381
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,400
Metro just passed through
the station.

1382
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,400
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1383
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,560
Go.

1384
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,720
Come on, Steve.

1385
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1386
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,520
Look out!
Look out!

1387
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,520
30 seconds and counting.

1388
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,080
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

1389
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,240
or you're paint on the train.

1390
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,880
Go, go, come on, come on!

1391
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,560
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

1392
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,680
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1393
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,600
You're gonna stop right there.

1394
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,840
Okay, guys.

1395
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,280
Coming into position.

1396
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,600
Stay cool.

1397
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,440
Ten...

1398
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,480
nine...

1399
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,200
eight...

1400
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,960
seven...

1401
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,280
six...

1402
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,920
five...

1403
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,600
four...

1404
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,400
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

1405
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,840
- Don't lose them.
- Three...

1406
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,760
two...

1407
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,440
one.

1408
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,680
Damn.

1409
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,160
Where's my truck?

1410
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,640
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

1411
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,760
It just blew right through
the street.

1412
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,200
Well, get under there.

1413
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,080
We have another problem, guys.

1414
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:25,920
What?

1415
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,760
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

1416
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,640
What?

1417
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,440
He switched safes on us.

1418
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,000
Can you do it?

1419
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,360
It's Israeli made.

1420
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,000
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1421
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,120
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

1422
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,840
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1423
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,720
steel rods snap into place

1424
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,880
and you can't open the safe.

1425
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,600
And then we're up shit creek.

1426
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:18,080
I think I just
cracked the glass.

1427
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,040
I don't think it broke though.

1428
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,800
I can't drill it again.

1429
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,280
I have to do it by touch.

1430
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,720
I can't get through.

1431
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,240
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1432
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,120
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

1433
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,120
11th and Fig.

1434
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,720
Positions two and three,

1435
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,520
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

1436
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,600
to Hollywood and Highland.

1437
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,200
Hurry up!

1438
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,200
Your attention please.

1439
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,200
Baggage for train number 22

1440
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,400
is now available
at carousel number four.

1441
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,240
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1442
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,000
at carousel number four.

1443
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,920
I can't do this, Charlie.

1444
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,880
Stella...

1445
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,960
I can't do it...
I need a drill,

1446
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,200
a borescope, something.

1447
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,560
- I need to...
- You don't need any of that.

1448
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,920
Come on, Charlie.

1449
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,080
Hey, you can do this.

1450
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,080
Slide.

1451
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,400
Come on, come on.

1452
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,120
Hey.

1453
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,240
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

1454
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,360
Absolutely.

1455
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,960
Napster.

1456
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,920
Yeah?

1457
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,920
13 across, four high, four deep.

1458
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,840
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

1459
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,040
How much?

1460
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,360
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

1461
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,120
2.7... 2.7 million.

1462
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:14,880
What?

1463
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:16,960
No, it's 27.

1464
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,360
That's 27 million.

1465
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,280
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

1466
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,360
Yeah!

1467
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,160
Got the... holy spirit.

1468
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,560
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

1469
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,720
What did you think, John?

1470
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,000
27 million.

1471
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,440
Say it again.

1472
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,720
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

1473
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,640
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

1474
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,800
Say it again!

1475
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,000
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1476
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,800
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

1477
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,360
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

1478
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,960
Stop them before they get
to the street.

1479
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,760
Shit!

1480
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,440
Whoa!

1481
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:23,960
Here we go.

1482
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:33,440
Whoo!

1483
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:35,960
Whoa! Whoa!

1484
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,160
Open your door.

1485
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,280
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1486
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,680
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

1487
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,480
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

1488
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,200
Come on!

1489
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,840
Where you going?
Where you going?

1490
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,320
I'm going to take Steve.

1491
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,440
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

1492
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,640
I'll meet you there.

1493
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,320
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

1494
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,440
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

1495
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,400
I know it's you, Charlie.

1496
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,280
Take your next left.

1497
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,800
Nice move, Steve.

1498
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,680
Get out!

1499
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,480
- Get out!
- Okay.

1500
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,040
I said get out!

1501
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:34,880
They got a bunch of cars

1502
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,480
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

1503
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,440
Look, look, man...

1504
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,840
- I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

1505
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,200
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

1506
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,800
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

1507
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,840
Come on.

1508
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,360
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

1509
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,120
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

1510
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,320
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

1511
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,880
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

1512
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,120
The helicopter routine,

1513
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,880
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

1514
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:22,400
But now I've got the gold...
and you, you've got nothing.

1515
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,200
I got this.

1516
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,400
So cut the crap,

1517
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,120
and give me my goddamn gold!

1518
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,480
Who the hell are you?

1519
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,240
I am Mashkov...

1520
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,160
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1521
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,120
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

1522
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,800
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

1523
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,840
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1524
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,000
a lot of unsavory people.

1525
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,680
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

1526
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,640
You are right...

1527
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,600
no imagination.

1528
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,760
There's a lot of gold in there.

1529
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,320
We're the only ones with guns.

1530
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,720
I'll make you a good deal.

1531
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,240
I've already made my deal.

1532
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,640
What do you want?

1533
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,880
You know this was
never about the gold.

1534
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:34,040
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

1535
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,840
Bitch!

1536
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,560
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1537
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,160
Okay.

1538
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,680
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1539
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,280
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

1540
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,240
Just don't shoot me.

1541
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:53,400
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

1542
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:56,320
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1543
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,160
I think you would be
very interested

1544
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,760
in some of the machinery I use.

1545
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,480
No, come on.

1546
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,840
Guys.

1547
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,960
I want to make a toast.

1548
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,360
To John Bridger,

1549
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,000
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

1550
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,920
Father and friend.

1551
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,960
To my dad.

1552
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,880
Stella was right.

1553
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,360
It wasn't about the money.

1554
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,840
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

1555
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,200
from having a little bit of fun.

1556
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,120
Money!

1557
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,520
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

1558
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,880
Get a good job with good pay...

1559
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,080
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

1560
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:48,360
Money, it's a gas

1561
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:53,400
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

1562
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,880
He got off with a warning.

1563
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,400
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

1564
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,960
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

1565
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,880
with a room just for his shoes.

1566
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:04,960
Buenos dias.

1567
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Buenos dias.

1568
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:12,040
Money, get back

1569
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,440
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

1570
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:18,760
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack

1571
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:19,880
Are you really the Napster?

1572
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,280
Money!

1573
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,400
Yes, I am.

1574
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,360
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1575
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,360
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

1576
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,520
With speakers so loud

1577
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,720
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

1578
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,080
I'm in the high-fidelity...

1579
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,240
If you would.

1580
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,760
...first class traveling set

1581
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:43,040
And I think I need a Lear jet

1582
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,080
And me?

1583
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,960
I took John Bridger's advice.

1584
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,160
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

1585
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,760
and I'm gonna hold on
to her forever.

1586
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,040
Money!

1587
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:07,560
It's a crime

1588
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:14,480
Share it fairly, but don't
take a slice of my pie

1589
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:20,560
Money, so they say

1590
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:27,400
Is the root of all evil today

1591
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:32,080
But if you ask for a raise
it's no surprise

1592
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,440
They're giving none away

1593
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,440
Away... away...

1594
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,440
Away...

1595
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,760
Away... away...

1596
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:42,720
Away...

1597
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,960
Away... away...

1598
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:45,920
Away...

1599
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,840
Away... away...

1600
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:48,800
Away...

1601
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,720
Away... away...

1602
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:51,680
Away...

1603
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,600
Away... away...

1604
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:54,560
Away...

1605
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,480
Away... away...

1606
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,440
Away...

1607
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,360
Away... away...

1608
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,320
Away...

1609
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,240
Away... away...

1610
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:03,200
Away...

1611
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:11,520
Away... away...
