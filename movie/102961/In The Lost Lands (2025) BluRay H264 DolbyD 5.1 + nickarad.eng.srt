00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:46,274
If you've got the time
and the stomach for it,

4
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:49,677
I've got a story for you.

5
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,877
A tale of magic and witches,

6
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:56,550
of quests and of monsters.

7
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,186
Of good and of evil.

8
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,790
But make no mistake.

9
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,325
This is no fairy tale.

10
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:12,732
And there are no happy endings.

11
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:28,687
<i>The world you know is gone,</i>

12
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,084
<i>consumed by the flames
of a great war long ago</i>

13
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:35,452
<i>when death
rained from the sky.</i>

14
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,963
<i>All that's left now
are the Lost Lands,</i>

15
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:43,935
<i>filled with twisted creatures
that dwell in the shadows.</i>

16
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:49,099
<i>What remains of humanity
takes refuge in a single city.</i>

17
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:52,171
<i>Long ago, a mysterious witch,</i>

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,739
<i>Gray Alys,
emerged from the Lost Lands.</i>

19
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:01,179
<i>This is the story
of how we met</i>

20
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:02,579
<i>and how she saved
the both of us.</i>

21
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:16,395
Stop your work!

22
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,966
Stop your work!

23
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:25,773
Let this be an example to all.

24
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:29,304
No one shall defy the church.

25
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:33,451
They say you can buy anything

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,782
you might desire from Gray Alys.

27
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,053
But it's better not to.

28
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,987
And still the people
seek your help.

29
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,487
They're ignorant,
uneducated.

30
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:48,232
Some are poor, some rich.
All are desperate.

31
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,429
I refuse no one.

32
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,570
Do you know what the church says
about the likes of you?

33
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,406
I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

34
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,006
That you are of the devil

35
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:00,340
and it's our duty
to root you out.

36
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,847
In the name of the Overlord,

37
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,549
ruler of
the City Under The Mountain,

38
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:08,012
High Priest of the Faith,

39
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,585
I sentence you, Gray Alys,

40
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:12,517
to death by hanging.

41
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:18,292
Repent, woman.

42
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,819
What is happening to me?

43
00:04:19,888 --> 00:04:21,790
You cannot be trusted.

44
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,254
You're a slave to the witch.

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,230
Hunt her down.

46
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,252
To me.

47
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,571
Show yourself, witch.

48
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:08,033
Do it.

49
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,596
Do it.

50
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,765
Witch!

51
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,105
I will find you.

52
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,542
You will burn in hell.

53
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,988
You will burn in hell, witch!

54
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,854
The witch that will not hang.

55
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,219
The witch that will not hang.

56
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,254
The witch that will not hang.

57
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:38,454
The witch that will not hang.

58
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,863
The witch that will not hang.

59
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,293
The witch that will not hang.

60
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:44,636
The witch that will not hang.

61
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,869
The witch that will not hang.

62
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,771
The witch that will not hang.

63
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:25,535
If a man wanted
to ambush another man,

64
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:27,211
this would be
the perfect spot.

65
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,852
Jump him while his eyes were
still adjusting to the dark.

66
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:48,063
Maybe even bring three,
four friends.

67
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,266
Make sure the job
got done right.

68
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,353
This thing has never worked.

69
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,803
But this never fails.

70
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,206
Gray Alys.

71
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,206
Did you recognize my footsteps?

72
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:44,442
No. Your kindness.

73
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,809
This city gets
worse and worse,

74
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,644
but you have always
been so generous

75
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,952
ever since I was a child.

76
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,182
Only to you.

77
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:58,958
You never ask anything of me.

78
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,362
Strange.

79
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:05,662
You sound no different
to when I was young,

80
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,670
but you must
be old now like me.

81
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:09,868
Older.

82
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,070
Much older.

83
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,700
- I am Jerais.
- Captain of the Overwatch.

84
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:43,632
Have you come on behalf
of the Overlord?

85
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,377
Or perhaps his queen?

86
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:01,523
What brings you
to visit one like me?

87
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:06,688
It is said that for a price,
you grant wishes.

88
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,795
What do you wish to buy?

89
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:11,765
Leave us.

90
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:16,803
I'm not sure if that is wise.

91
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:36,227
Some say you came
from the Lost Lands

92
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,687
and that you know the things
that live there.

93
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:41,527
Dark, unnatural things.

94
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,527
Is this what
you want from me?

95
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:45,403
To tell you fairy tales?

96
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:50,306
I want from you the power
to become a beast, Gray Alys.

97
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,212
To be more than human.
Does that shock you?

98
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,545
I have seen too much
to be shocked so easily.

99
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:02,543
So you can sell me
the secret of shapeshifting?

100
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:03,883
To a wolf?

101
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,500
Are you certain you want
what you ask for?

102
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:20,438
You might not be happy
with what you receive.

103
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:25,100
- This is not your concern.
- I am compelled to help,

104
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,436
- but I warn all who come to me.
- I'm not all.

105
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,112
Mm.

106
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:33,250
Will you accept my offer?

107
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,818
I refuse no one.
I'll hire a hunter.

108
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:41,751
We'll find you a shapeshifter
and take its power.

109
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,755
Give me until the full moon

110
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:47,392
and I will bring you
what you desire.

111
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,226
Where will you go?

112
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,002
To the Lost Lands.

113
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,953
What is it, Jerais?

114
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:17,695
Do you refuse no one?

115
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,387
No one.

116
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,135
Then accept it as my payment.
I wish to buy for myself.

117
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:35,642
This timepiece has been
in my family for generations.

118
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:37,641
It's my most valuable
possession.

119
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,643
And what do you wish for?

120
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:42,043
I want you to fail her.

121
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,187
The Overwatch
is sworn to loyalty,

122
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,957
yet you betray your queen.

123
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,221
I am loyal.

124
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,693
I know what's good for her
better than she knows herself.

125
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,394
This power that she seeks
will destroy her.

126
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:57,868
I only want to help.

127
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,970
You lie, Jerais.

128
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,138
You reek of jealousy.

129
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,035
I will not argue with you.

130
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:09,671
If you will not sell to me,
I will leave.

131
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,175
I refuse no one.

132
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,351
You shall have
what you want.

133
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,196
I'm sorry.

134
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,805
What is it you want?

135
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,431
Help me.

136
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,806
Shit.

137
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,148
Did you wet yourself again?

138
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,612
Can't you use the bell,

139
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,247
you old disgusting fool?

140
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,392
The mighty Overlord.

141
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,051
Hard to believe
you built all this.

142
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,255
And that they still fear you.

143
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:43,628
You're nothing more
than a filthy pig,

144
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,794
just like all men.

145
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,298
My queen?

146
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,973
All men, except for one.

147
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,386
Don't leave yet.

148
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:08,851
I have to.

149
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,655
Before they see me.

150
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,125
I can't stay here.

151
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:18,263
Hurry back. Please.

152
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,434
I will.

153
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:23,807
Perhaps.

154
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,541
Halt in the name
of the Overlord.

155
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:36,781
What are you doing here?

156
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,948
The stronger the spirits,

157
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,794
the weaker the senses.

158
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,193
You're coming with us.

159
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,741
That was half full.

160
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:22,464
I hear you're a hunter,
that you travel the Lost Lands.

161
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,834
I have use of such a man.

162
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,236
Came here to play cards,
not to talk.

163
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:15,050
All in.

164
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:37,468
You ready to talk now?

165
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,509
What's your name?

166
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,239
Boyce.

167
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,078
I'm looking for a guide.

168
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,245
Someone who knows
the Lost Lands.

169
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,546
- I'm expensive.
- I have money.

170
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,083
I know you do.
Most of it's mine.

171
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,388
Are you worth it?

172
00:19:57,457 --> 00:20:00,458
Would you be here
talking to me if I wasn't?

173
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:06,565
Lost Lands'
no place for city folk.

174
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:07,701
Why is that?

175
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,031
Because they're weak.

176
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,044
Do I look weak to you?

177
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,713
Look.

178
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,815
Outside these walls,
the laws of the city,

179
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,280
of man, even of nature,
they don't apply.

180
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,821
So whoever
you think you are here,

181
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:29,788
out there you'd
just be a hindrance.

182
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:32,957
Let's make a deal.

183
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,830
If I ever slow you down,

184
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,469
you have my permission
to leave me behind.

185
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,695
And I'll do the same to you.

186
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,207
Why do you want
to leave the city?

187
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,975
I'm looking for a man
who can turn into a beast.

188
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,617
All men are beasts.

189
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,416
But not all men are monsters.

190
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:04,587
You're looking
for a shapeshifter.

191
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:09,324
Yes. I need to kill it
in its lair to take its power.

192
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:12,898
I've heard of such a man.

193
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,070
What do you know of him?

194
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:20,373
They call him Sardor,
the Great Wolf.

195
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:29,278
Where does this man,
this Sardor, live?

196
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:31,078
In a place called Skull River.

197
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:33,653
Skull River.

198
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:42,192
That's my destination.

199
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,360
Not many have
travelled there.

200
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,603
- No one's come back.
- Guide me...

201
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,073
and this can be yours.

202
00:21:56,375 --> 00:22:01,414
I've heard of these.
Never seen one.

203
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,183
I'll take it.

204
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:07,156
And the coin
you stole from me.

205
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:12,827
You'll receive your payment
once I get to Skull River.

206
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,396
Friends of yours?

207
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,899
Yeah, I don't have
many friends.

208
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:22,798
Me neither.

209
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,705
Gun!

210
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,832
Find them.

211
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,839
That bitch killed my snake!

212
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:21,227
No one shall defy the Church.

213
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:24,228
It is the Church
that protects the peace

214
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:26,830
of this city with its laws.

215
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:31,637
The Church that puts fear
into the hearts of the godless.

216
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:37,406
The Church that keeps the evils
of the Lost Lands at bay.

217
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:40,975
We are God's instruments,

218
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:45,122
placed on this earth to protect
you from such evils.

219
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:49,421
Hunt down the sinners,
the heretics, and the witches.

220
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:54,527
Bring them to me
and you shall be rewarded.

221
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:12,276
Gray Alys, with a man.

222
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:14,641
They left the city together.

223
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,820
The people lose respect for us.

224
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,520
"The Witch That Will Not Hang."

225
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:24,227
Gray Alys has become
a symbol of their defiance.

226
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:28,929
She left you alive on
that cross to humiliate us.

227
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:30,864
This woman needs to die.

228
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:35,238
There is another matter.

229
00:24:45,377 --> 00:24:49,311
- What is this?
- Tell him.

230
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:59,995
Tell him.

231
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:03,959
A man and a woman
went to see her.

232
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,135
I heard their names.

233
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:11,604
It was Jerais and the queen.

234
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:18,143
If the queen has been
consorting with a heretic,

235
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,743
it would be her downfall.

236
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,586
Make sure the witch
makes a full confession

237
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,254
before she hangs.

238
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,652
No mistakes.

239
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,019
No good.

240
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:15,938
Never saw a man get emotional
about a snake before.

241
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:18,803
I'm not emotional, it just--

242
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,312
It was a damn good snake,
that's all.

243
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,286
Here. The pin was bent.
It should work well now.

244
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,520
As long as you stop
beating men to death with it.

245
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,455
A clever man might choose
to kill his client on the road

246
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,455
and take his payment early.

247
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:23,035
But no one ever accused me
of being a clever man.

248
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:21,022
This is Ross's place.

249
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:24,161
He and his sister Mara
are old friends of mine.

250
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,893
Are we?

251
00:28:26,962 --> 00:28:30,698
Hey, Ross.

252
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:32,442
It's good to see you.

253
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,071
And Mara.

254
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,848
- Welcoming as ever.
- It's been a while.

255
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,779
You look soft.

256
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,748
The City has been
treating you well.

257
00:28:44,816 --> 00:28:46,852
- As have the women, I bet.
- Mm.

258
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,090
Ooh-ooh!

259
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:59,029
Uh, meet my traveling
companion Gray Alys.

260
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,898
Welcome.

261
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,870
A friend of Boyce
is a friend of ours.

262
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:15,779
The powers I want from Sardor
will be strongest in his lair.

263
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:18,948
How much longer
till Skull River?

264
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:22,117
- A week, maybe longer.
- I need him as a wolf,

265
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:25,125
so we need to get there
before the full moon.

266
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:26,923
That won't be easy.

267
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:28,894
Well, if it was easy,
I wouldn't need you.

268
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:37,834
The only way would be
following the train tracks.

269
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,676
The tunnels cut
through the mountains.

270
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:44,712
It'd be dangerous, but we'd
save maybe a day or two.

271
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:52,016
I have something I wanted you...

272
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,487
Yeah.

273
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:57,527
You need another drink.

274
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,596
Always happy to see me.

275
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:04,261
It gets boring out here.

276
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,030
Lucky her.

277
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:11,634
So, who is this woman

278
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:14,835
you're traveling with?

279
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:16,942
None of your concern.

280
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:23,349
Do you like her?

281
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:26,117
Not the way I like you.

282
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,425
Ah.

283
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,654
Will it be another year
until I see you again?

284
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:36,058
Mm. If I'm still alive.

285
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,965
One year-- a long time
in the Lost Lands.

286
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,836
You come, you go.

287
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:48,902
I don't know
anything about you.

288
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:51,311
What do you want to know?

289
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:54,211
Do you ever get lonely?

290
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,310
I do.

291
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,989
Let me tell you
about loneliness.

292
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,917
Think of a child...

293
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:06,092
out there in the darkness.

294
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:07,757
Afraid.

295
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,595
His parents beaten to death

296
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:13,566
right in front of his eyes.

297
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:17,238
The boy travels
the wasteland,

298
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:18,934
hiding from the outlaws

299
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,575
and the raiders
during the day,

300
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:24,776
and the creatures
and the ghouls at night.

301
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:28,746
Till one day
that boy becomes a man,

302
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:33,949
and his heart
and his mind harden.

303
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,220
But still he travels on,
silently,

304
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,426
scared to get close to anyone
for fear of losing them.

305
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:46,361
That is loneliness.

306
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:51,537
And that little boy was you.

307
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:55,312
No. Hell no. Of course not.

308
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,139
I've never cried
a day in my life.

309
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,881
You really don't know
anything about me.

310
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:21,196
Those are the last
friendly faces we'll see.

311
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,434
There's only the Lost Lands
ahead of us now.

312
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:09,312
What are you doing here?

313
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,148
Offering a prayer for
the Overlord's swift return.

314
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:16,217
Patriarch, the train
and a large contingent

315
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,053
of your enforcers
have left the city.

316
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,389
- Who authorized this?
- I did.

317
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,657
- Where are they going?
- To catch the witch Gray Alys.

318
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:27,064
- She is wanted for heresy.
- Your men are needed here.

319
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,833
There is growing unrest
in the streets.

320
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:31,000
You leave us vulnerable,
Patriarch.

321
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:34,071
Witchcraft is
punishable by death,

322
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,678
both for the witch
and all who consort with her.

323
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:40,209
I do not care about her
or what she does.

324
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:44,620
- And why is that?
- Do not question me.

325
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,085
- I speak for the Overlord.
- Forgive me.

326
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:52,858
But you are right,
these are dangerous times.

327
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:55,660
The Overlord's hand
is losing its grip.

328
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,292
I see defiance everywhere.

329
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,733
- And there are rumors.
- What rumors?

330
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:04,668
- I cannot.
- What rumors?

331
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:08,738
Of your infidelity.

332
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,272
Nothing but lies.

333
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:13,640
Yes. Vile words spoken
by the basest of tongues.

334
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:18,051
But even amongst the scum
and rabble, lies have power.

335
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,121
<i>The queen is guilty
of consorting with a witch.</i>

336
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,928
<i>I see it clearly now.</i>

337
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:32,058
Bring me Gray Alys
and her confession.

338
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:33,896
I will do the rest.

339
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:35,671
<i>The Overlord is dying,</i>

340
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,432
<i>and with no heir,
the queen is weak.</i>

341
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:41,236
Soon, there will be
a new day in the city.

342
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:46,215
And with the new dawn,
a new Overlord.

343
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:57,226
Aah! Please!

344
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:58,921
- God.
- No!

345
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:02,329
I told you all I know!

346
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,196
Aah! I swear!

347
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,905
No! No!

348
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:16,904
No! Stop! No!

349
00:35:16,973 --> 00:35:18,173
Skull River!

350
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,775
That's where they're going.

351
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:21,176
Skull River!

352
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,513
That's where they're going.

353
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:25,145
Burn it.

354
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,785
Do you have a family
out here, Boyce?

355
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,385
Like a home?

356
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,895
The Lost Lands
are a lonely place.

357
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,461
The city, too.

358
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,310
They call it the Rift.

359
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:33,648
There's a place up ahead where
we can make a safe crossing.

360
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:56,341
Sirus!

361
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,377
Where you at, old man?

362
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:04,282
That's my friend's cable car.

363
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:07,053
Old Sirus will take us over
for a silver coin.

364
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:10,018
He keeps fresh horses
on the other side.

365
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:10,894
You're paying.

366
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,198
Sirus?

367
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,175
Sirus?

368
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,213
Wait here.

369
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:44,581
Boyce?

370
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:48,222
Seems Sirus had visitors.

371
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:53,623
So do we.

372
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:09,011
So you're Boyce. The Hunter.

373
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,240
We asked the old man
if you had already crossed.

374
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,911
He wasn't very helpful.

375
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,212
I always liked Sirus.

376
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:19,088
Who is that with you, hunter?

377
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:26,189
None of your tricks, witch.

378
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:27,896
You can't look us in the eye.

379
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,259
Hand her over
and we'll let you live.

380
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:32,035
There's a bounty on her head.

381
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,271
Sorry, she hired me first.

382
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,880
A man of principle.
Who'd have thought?

383
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:48,117
Give us the witch
or you both die.

384
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,689
No.

385
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,233
No one shall defy the Church.

386
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,636
You say you're servants of God?
What kind of God is this?

387
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:11,434
The vengeful kind.

388
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:15,137
You came here
looking for a monster.

389
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:16,541
Now you found one.

390
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:26,551
Boyce...

391
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:31,922
Behold.

392
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:34,890
A resurrection.

393
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,660
No!

394
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:24,975
Boyce, we have to go.

395
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:26,042
Let's go!

396
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:45,399
Quick!

397
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,449
Cut the cable.

398
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:18,121
Cut the cable!

399
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,159
Cut it!

400
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:58,125
We have to climb!

401
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,070
Come on!

402
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:38,731
Why didn't she finish me?

403
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:44,938
She tried.

404
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,565
A witch, indeed.

405
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,111
How do we cross?

406
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:52,309
We have to go around.

407
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:54,007
Then let's move.

408
00:45:54,076 --> 00:45:56,811
They'll be headed
for the mountains.

409
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,822
No. Hell is where
they re headed.

410
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:19,168
You all right?

411
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:20,707
Drunk.

412
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:26,779
Thank you.

413
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:31,414
I could've died back there.

414
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:33,016
No, you couldn't.

415
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,756
Not until you get me
to Skull River.

416
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:54,070
Okay. I'm ready.

417
00:47:17,531 --> 00:47:18,996
Would you mind
stitching me up?

418
00:47:20,266 --> 00:47:21,328
Of course.

419
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,609
I think I'd like
to pass out now.

420
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,131
Nice work.

421
00:47:58,502 --> 00:47:59,608
Still hurts.

422
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,139
Drink this.

423
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:24,127
You're thinking
about your friends?

424
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,637
I'm sorry.

425
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:37,739
Ross was a good man.

426
00:48:37,807 --> 00:48:39,142
Known him a long time.

427
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:44,312
Mara.

428
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:51,924
I'm going to kill them
for what they did.

429
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:08,270
Why do you travel
out here, Boyce?

430
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:15,315
I love the city, the people,

431
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:19,014
a strong drink, good food.

432
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:21,349
Yet a part of me
only feels at home here.

433
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:25,419
Listening to the wind.

434
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:29,192
Watching the shadows.

435
00:49:33,698 --> 00:49:35,704
See there, Gray Alys?

436
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:42,204
See the way the lights
shimmer and shift?

437
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,438
You can see shapes in them
if you look long enough.

438
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:49,711
Yes.

439
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,247
It's beautiful.

440
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:55,718
I knew you'd see.

441
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:59,060
We're alike, you and I.

442
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,658
In our blood.

443
00:50:01,726 --> 00:50:03,457
We're two of a kind.

444
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:08,462
I could see it in your eyes.

445
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,585
You are pregnant.

446
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,260
You may go now.

447
00:50:44,471 --> 00:50:47,671
Did you hear?

448
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,541
Of course, you didn't.

449
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:52,275
We have an heir.

450
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:58,311
Not that you had
anything to do with it.

451
00:50:58,379 --> 00:51:01,553
Do you want to know
who the father

452
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:03,352
of the new Overlord is?

453
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,130
Boyce.

454
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,592
That's his name.

455
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:13,666
A simple hunter.

456
00:51:13,735 --> 00:51:15,804
I once was
a simple girl myself.

457
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:19,742
Look at me now.

458
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,544
The train.

459
00:52:36,613 --> 00:52:38,144
We'll need to take the pass
or they'll run us down.

460
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:40,184
It'll be dangerous.

461
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:41,355
When night falls,
demons roam these mountains.

462
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,654
We have no choice.

463
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,745
This is where
we make a stand.

464
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:10,011
Help me with these.

465
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,016
We need a fire all night.

466
00:53:13,085 --> 00:53:15,682
Flame is the only thing
they fear.

467
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,523
We don't have long.

468
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:01,200
Prepare yourself.

469
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:47,048
Here they come.

470
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:25,509
Gray Alys.

471
00:56:27,914 --> 00:56:31,848
You should not have

472
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:34,456
come back here.

473
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:08,884
Leave him.

474
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:10,722
Boyce!

475
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:15,826
Help me! Boyce!

476
00:58:01,602 --> 00:58:04,942
The fire from your hands,

477
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:07,549
I didn't feel it.

478
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:09,850
There was no fire.

479
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:12,514
It couldn't have hurt us,

480
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,348
but to them the illusion
was real enough.

481
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:17,717
Why do you suffer then?

482
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:21,724
The powers I wield
come at a price.

483
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:28,269
I heard the monster
talking to you.

484
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,508
He knew me.

485
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:35,739
A long time ago.

486
00:58:35,808 --> 00:58:38,113
How?

487
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:42,144
There is a great treasure
inside of this place.

488
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:45,345
An immense power.

489
00:58:45,414 --> 00:58:48,020
A man came to me.

490
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:53,154
He was greedy,
power hungry.

491
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:55,557
They all are.

492
00:58:55,626 --> 00:59:01,395
But I can refuse no one,
so I helped him.

493
00:59:01,464 --> 00:59:03,731
But this place is poison.

494
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,504
It turned him and his men
into what you saw.

495
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:11,980
He shouldn't have
asked me for help.

496
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,811
No one should ever
ask me for help.

497
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,719
I should just be left alone.

498
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:26,294
You're with me now.

499
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:48,715
There are tracks
to the west.

500
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:50,714
They are close.

501
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:12,005
The Overlord is dead,

502
01:00:12,073 --> 01:00:15,810
but the queen is with child!

503
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:18,874
All hail the new Overlord!

504
01:00:32,521 --> 01:00:36,295
The Overlord is dead!

505
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:39,867
All hail the new Overlord.

506
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:42,036
And all hail the queen.

507
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,900
All hail the queen.

508
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:23,701
Hail the Overlord
and hail the queen.

509
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,413
Thank you, Patriarch.

510
01:01:27,578 --> 01:01:31,042
Now we both
have what we wanted.

511
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:35,520
You have your heir
and I have his power.

512
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:40,051
16 years until your child
will be of age.

513
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,193
We couldn't ask
for his authority

514
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:44,326
to be in better hands.

515
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:45,793
You are too kind.

516
01:01:45,862 --> 01:01:48,062
I wouldn't have
anything, Patriarch,

517
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:53,804
not without your wise advice
and unfailing support.

518
01:01:53,872 --> 01:01:57,711
- I hope that will never change.
- Your loyal servant.

519
01:01:57,779 --> 01:01:59,810
Always.

520
01:02:02,111 --> 01:02:05,418
The dirty whore sits upon
the throne of the city.

521
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:08,351
<i>An affront to all
that is good and pure.</i>

522
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:10,225
Our time is running out.

523
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,218
<i>Her power grows stronger
by the day.</i>

524
01:02:13,287 --> 01:02:16,760
<i>Find me the witch.
Bring me her confession.</i>

525
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:21,136
Then the witch and the whore
will hang together.

526
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,064
<i>But hurry.
Do you hear me? Hurry!</i>

527
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:01,102
Tomorrow we'll
reach Skull River.

528
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:09,011
- Will he be there?
- Sardor?

529
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,482
I don't know. I hope not.

530
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:15,450
I need to face him alone.

531
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:17,019
Then you will die.

532
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,261
One always has to die.

533
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,132
This is madness.

534
01:03:36,506 --> 01:03:37,606
You should leave.

535
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:41,876
You did what I paid you to do.

536
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:43,311
I never should have
accepted your offer.

537
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,710
But you did.

538
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:47,648
Leave, Boyce.

539
01:03:47,716 --> 01:03:51,190
- Save yourself.
- No.

540
01:03:51,259 --> 01:03:54,289
Forget this. Turn around.

541
01:03:54,358 --> 01:03:57,291
I cannot.

542
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,660
Why?

543
01:03:59,729 --> 01:04:01,602
Because I have no choice.

544
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:10,072
No one should ever
ask me for help.

545
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,581
Gray.

546
01:04:16,479 --> 01:04:17,585
Come back.

547
01:04:18,745 --> 01:04:19,950
With me.

548
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:24,925
Don't you understand, Boyce?

549
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:28,493
I'm cursed.

550
01:04:28,562 --> 01:04:30,598
No one should ever
get close to me.

551
01:04:32,628 --> 01:04:34,602
I don't care.

552
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:56,184
The Patriarch
calling to the faithful.

553
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:02,729
This is the moment
we've been working for.

554
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:05,726
What we've been dreaming of
since we were small,

555
01:05:05,795 --> 01:05:07,961
looking up at this place.

556
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,964
But he can take
it all away from us.

557
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,635
My Overwatch
outnumber his men now.

558
01:05:13,704 --> 01:05:15,643
But he is still dangerous.

559
01:05:18,511 --> 01:05:20,309
Would you do
anything for me?

560
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:22,177
Anything.

561
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:29,855
You are my good soldier.

562
01:05:39,664 --> 01:05:41,564
You're quiet.

563
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,495
Skull River lies up ahead.

564
01:05:55,712 --> 01:05:58,009
They're coming.

565
01:05:58,078 --> 01:05:59,214
We can't outrun 'em.

566
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,416
We won't have to.

567
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,379
- The Witch!
- Yes!

568
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:39,151
<i>Our time is upon us.</i>

569
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,457
<i>Make haste!
Do you hear me?</i>

570
01:06:41,526 --> 01:06:42,125
Make haste!

571
01:06:44,665 --> 01:06:48,436
You will not escape us
this time!

572
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,595
There will be
a new day in the city.

573
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,337
Repent, Witch!

574
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,822
No!

575
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:03,906
Without the witch,

576
01:08:03,975 --> 01:08:05,740
we must take the throne
by force.

577
01:08:05,809 --> 01:08:06,814
Assemble my guard.

578
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,051
Do you hear me?

579
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:20,760
Brothers? Brothers, to me!

580
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:23,793
There is no use.
Your brothers are dead.

581
01:08:23,862 --> 01:08:27,263
You heretic.

582
01:08:32,034 --> 01:08:33,608
In the name of the Overlord,

583
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,269
protector of
the City Under The Mountain,

584
01:08:35,338 --> 01:08:40,507
I hereby sentence you,
Patriarch, to death.

585
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:14,746
My God.
How many has he killed?

586
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:16,609
Everyone that's come
against him.

587
01:09:49,044 --> 01:09:51,813
Look at all this.

588
01:09:51,882 --> 01:09:54,088
Someone lives here.

589
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,483
Sardor.

590
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:03,656
This fire hasn't
been lit in weeks.

591
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,895
Tonight will be
the full moon.

592
01:10:07,963 --> 01:10:09,937
He will come then.

593
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:19,577
It's not too late
to turn back.

594
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:23,582
We could leave now.

595
01:10:23,651 --> 01:10:25,279
You think he would let us?

596
01:10:25,348 --> 01:10:28,120
Do you think
he's not watching us?

597
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:35,127
You could go.
I could hold him back.

598
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:44,603
No.

599
01:10:44,671 --> 01:10:45,800
It is too late for that.

600
01:10:53,946 --> 01:10:55,477
It will be a full moon tonight.

601
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:01,483
You're still thinking
about that witch.

602
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:05,421
She promised me.

603
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,362
You don't need
what she promised.

604
01:11:15,966 --> 01:11:18,038
You have everything now.

605
01:11:22,169 --> 01:11:23,505
Not everything.

606
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,433
Silver?

607
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,238
Silver.

608
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,910
Your weapons will be useless.

609
01:11:57,979 --> 01:12:01,142
They've come against him
with silver.

610
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:03,946
Silver swords, silver knives,

611
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:06,014
arrows tipped with silver.

612
01:12:06,082 --> 01:12:08,381
They're all dust now,

613
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,454
all those brave,
silvered warriors.

614
01:12:21,032 --> 01:12:24,537
Please, don't do this.

615
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:25,798
We have no choice.

616
01:12:59,436 --> 01:13:03,740
I think he is very
close now, Boyce.

617
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:05,438
What say you?

618
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:08,010
Not yet.
There's still time, Gray.

619
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:10,808
I think you lie, hunter!

620
01:13:10,877 --> 01:13:13,885
There was never any Sardor.

621
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:17,757
Only you.

622
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:21,891
You knew? You knew what I was?

623
01:13:24,962 --> 01:13:28,396
I cared for you.

624
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:32,169
All this time,
you tried to deceive me.

625
01:13:32,237 --> 01:13:34,773
You thought
you could bring me here

626
01:13:34,842 --> 01:13:36,506
and kill me like the rest!

627
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:43,243
You shouldn't have ever

628
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:46,487
come here-- here, Gray Alys.

629
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:50,315
I tried to warn you.

630
01:17:32,845 --> 01:17:34,381
Calm.

631
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,617
You need to rest while
the moon is still covered.

632
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,918
You have a gift I'd kill for.

633
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:51,293
You change at will,
full moon or not.

634
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:56,202
No. It was just an illusion.

635
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,934
To distract you,
to leave you vulnerable.

636
01:18:03,572 --> 01:18:06,737
We're the same, Gray.

637
01:18:06,806 --> 01:18:10,343
- Don't you see?
- Yes.

638
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:11,781
Two of a kind.

639
01:18:22,128 --> 01:18:23,155
You are still weak.

640
01:18:26,558 --> 01:18:27,665
Sleep.

641
01:19:00,934 --> 01:19:02,229
Untie me.

642
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:07,401
I don't understand.

643
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:10,342
Why? You saved me.

644
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:12,842
You would not
like my answer, Boyce.

645
01:19:15,445 --> 01:19:18,078
It's the moon.

646
01:19:18,147 --> 01:19:20,746
Are you afraid of what'll
happen if I change again?

647
01:19:20,815 --> 01:19:22,354
I won't harm you, Gray Alys.

648
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:26,123
- Not now.
- I do not fear you, Boyce.

649
01:19:26,192 --> 01:19:28,823
I know you too well.

650
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:32,262
I learned all your
weaknesses along the way.

651
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:32,895
I even added to them.

652
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:37,497
What are you talking about?

653
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:41,141
I'm so sorry.

654
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,437
Your fate was sealed
when you met me.

655
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,995
You were right, Boyce.

656
01:20:12,064 --> 01:20:13,840
Silver weapons
were not enough.

657
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,903
You poisoned me?

658
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:19,477
I had to put silver
in your blood.

659
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:23,110
Why didn't
you just let me die?

660
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,718
Because dead things
have no power.

661
01:20:31,787 --> 01:20:33,285
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.

662
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:38,090
You-- you have
to grant my wish.

663
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,798
You can refuse no one.
Those are your words.

664
01:20:44,968 --> 01:20:48,899
- What do you wish for, Boyce?
- I want you.

665
01:20:48,968 --> 01:20:52,170
I want us to be together.

666
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,908
I want us to hunt together,
to fight together.

667
01:20:54,977 --> 01:20:57,711
To find an end
to all this loneliness?

668
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,052
Yes, you want it, too,
I know it.

669
01:21:01,121 --> 01:21:05,653
I refuse no one.

670
01:21:05,722 --> 01:21:07,389
But there is a price
to be paid.

671
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:08,958
Name it. Anything.

672
01:21:12,428 --> 01:21:13,864
Very well.

673
01:23:35,304 --> 01:23:39,611
- The witch is back!
- It's her! It's her!

674
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,846
- She's back!
- She's back! The witch!

675
01:23:42,915 --> 01:23:44,845
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

676
01:23:44,914 --> 01:23:46,847
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

677
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:49,083
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

678
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:51,555
Get back to work!

679
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,091
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

680
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,859
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

681
01:23:58,928 --> 01:24:01,460
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

682
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:02,829
- The Witch That Will Not Hang!
- Down with the Overlord!

683
01:24:02,897 --> 01:24:05,403
Down with the Church!

684
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:06,668
Down with the Overlord!

685
01:24:06,736 --> 01:24:08,905
Down with the Church!

686
01:24:08,974 --> 01:24:12,102
Down with the Overlord!
Down with the Church!

687
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:13,741
Down with the Overlord!

688
01:24:13,809 --> 01:24:15,108
Down with the Church!

689
01:24:46,543 --> 01:24:48,073
Take this.

690
01:24:48,142 --> 01:24:50,145
Tell the queen to cut herself,

691
01:24:50,214 --> 01:24:53,686
to drip her own blood
onto the skin and wear it.

692
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,687
Tonight will be the end
of the lunar cycle.

693
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:58,786
She must do it
before the end of night.

694
01:24:58,855 --> 01:25:00,653
Then the power will be hers.

695
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:03,125
Wolf skin?

696
01:25:03,194 --> 01:25:08,428
The skin of a shapeshifter
killed in its lair.

697
01:25:08,497 --> 01:25:11,469
Well, Gray Alys, you have
done what she asked of you,

698
01:25:11,537 --> 01:25:12,933
but you have failed me.

699
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:14,606
I did not pay you for success.

700
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:16,937
Now, give me
my timepiece back.

701
01:25:17,006 --> 01:25:19,809
No, Jerais. I've earned it.

702
01:25:19,878 --> 01:25:21,942
But I did not get
what I asked for.

703
01:25:22,011 --> 01:25:23,617
But you got
what you wanted.

704
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:28,115
- And what is that?
- The queen herself.

705
01:25:28,184 --> 01:25:32,725
There was a man,
the father of her child.

706
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,592
You wanted her, but knew
he stood in your way.

707
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:37,956
I have changed that.

708
01:25:45,868 --> 01:25:47,366
Who was this man?

709
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:51,167
What was his name?

710
01:25:51,236 --> 01:25:55,608
His name was Boyce.

711
01:25:55,677 --> 01:25:58,218
No!

712
01:25:58,287 --> 01:26:01,550
She killed Boyce!

713
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:03,384
No, please.

714
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:08,395
It could never have been.

715
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,790
What are you talking about?

716
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:12,932
He was a beast.

717
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:16,798
Beast?

718
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:19,801
What do you know of it?

719
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:23,407
He twisted you. You changed.

720
01:26:23,476 --> 01:26:25,777
You did this.

721
01:26:25,846 --> 01:26:29,076
I did what I had to do.
I protected you.

722
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:33,412
- You betrayed me.
- No, no. I--

723
01:26:33,481 --> 01:26:36,285
You had him killed.
The father of my child!

724
01:26:38,987 --> 01:26:40,987
- Please.
- No!

725
01:26:41,056 --> 01:26:43,292
I would do anything for you.

726
01:26:47,929 --> 01:26:49,364
Then die for me.

727
01:26:55,103 --> 01:26:57,809
I did this for you, Boyce.

728
01:26:57,877 --> 01:27:01,246
So we could be together,
hunt together.

729
01:27:14,358 --> 01:27:16,056
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

730
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,860
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

731
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:19,598
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

732
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,600
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

733
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,602
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

734
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,131
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

735
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,705
The Witch That Will Not Hang!

736
01:27:42,985 --> 01:27:44,386
Down with the Overlord!

737
01:29:38,266 --> 01:29:42,433
So, how'd you like my story?

738
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,207
I still don't know how it ends.

739
01:29:45,275 --> 01:29:48,438
Maybe with me
skinning you alive,

740
01:29:48,506 --> 01:29:49,511
just like you did to me.

741
01:29:53,712 --> 01:29:56,014
I'm not sure
I like that ending.

742
01:29:56,082 --> 01:29:58,483
Too bad.

743
01:29:58,552 --> 01:30:00,951
I knew you were
the queen's lover.

744
01:30:02,657 --> 01:30:04,459
- Don't leave yet.
- You know what I am.

745
01:30:04,528 --> 01:30:06,295
- I can't stay here.
- You said the only woman

746
01:30:06,364 --> 01:30:09,431
you could truly love
would be someone like you.

747
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,633
- You are not that.
- But what if I could be?

748
01:30:12,702 --> 01:30:15,942
I want from you the power
to become a beast, Gray Alys.

749
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:20,241
- I refuse no one.
- I want you to fail her.

750
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,910
- I refuse no one.
- I want you.

751
01:30:22,979 --> 01:30:24,875
I refuse no one.

752
01:30:24,944 --> 01:30:28,050
<i>I knew
that the queen's desires</i>

753
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:31,815
<i>would lead to revolution.</i>

754
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:35,154
<i>And that she would
never wear your skin.</i>

755
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:38,058
I knew you would live.

756
01:30:38,126 --> 01:30:40,562
You're lying.

757
01:30:42,695 --> 01:30:44,929
Just like I know
that'll misfire.

758
01:30:56,415 --> 01:30:58,276
<i>They say you can buy
anything you might desire</i>

759
01:30:58,345 --> 01:31:00,750
<i>from Gray Alys...</i>

760
01:31:03,352 --> 01:31:05,554
<i>...but it is better not to.</i>

761
01:31:08,523 --> 01:31:10,394
And isn't this
what we wished for?
