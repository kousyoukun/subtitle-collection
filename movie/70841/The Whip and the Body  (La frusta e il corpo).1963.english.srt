1
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,607
Katya...

2
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,613
Don't, you mustn't. It was all such a
long time ago, Georgia.

3
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,288
Not for me, Katya.
Not for me.

4
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,121
It's the blood of m y
daughter on that blade.

5
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,565
I cling to m y hatred as I cling
to this dagger.

6
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:56,406
Before I die, I swear I'll see this
dagger plunged into his throat.

7
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:04,581
As I saw it in Tanya's because
of him.

8
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,584
Crying won't help now.

9
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,575
He's back. Kurt is back.

10
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,919
Georgia.

11
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:27,423
Yes... Kurt is back. You can't
stop the hand of fate.

12
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,560
My lord! My lord! Kurt is
back!

13
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,900
What did you say?

14
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,405
Kurt is back.

15
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,566
Yes, Losat, I'm back.

16
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,581
I told you never to come back.

17
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,257
Who are you trying to frighten,
Kurt?

18
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,459
No one... I came back
because I heard of your marriage.

19
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,530
Good luck.

20
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,606
My compliments, Nevenka.

21
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,280
Thank you, Kurt.

22
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,614
Tell the truth, Kurt. What do
you want?

23
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:06,289
Brother, I came back to compliment
you on your choice of a wife.

24
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,623
You must be tired, Kurt.

25
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,299
Kurt, you're not m y son. You're
a serpent. You like to make
others suffer.

26
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:19,975
You seduced Tanya, and then
abandoned her, causing her
to kill herself.

27
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,309
The same old story.

28
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,311
Father, you promised.

29
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,985
He didn't come back to seek
m y forgiveness.

30
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,651
You're so wrong, father. I
also came back for that.

31
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,493
No, I don't believe you.

32
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,655
Are you afraid of me,
Christian?

33
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:49,267
That which was once mine is
now yours. Now, it is you who
are the favorite son.

34
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:56,606
I've never been afraid of you.
As far as I'm concerned, you
can stay if you want to.

35
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,617
All right, Kurt, you can stay.

36
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,116
I've never had a warmer
welcome.

37
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:58,600
It's wonderful to see things
being born, to see them born
and to see them die.

38
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,603
Let me go.

39
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:09,611
My pretty little cousin. You're
still in love with m y brother. You
wouldn't exactly refuse him if he...

40
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,287
You miserable wretch.

41
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:21,298
You always wanted to marry
him. And instead? Christian's
marriage was bitter for you too.

42
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,986
Poisoned?

43
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:52,257
No, that's not the way it'll be, Kurt
Menliff. You'll die the same way you
made m y daughter die.

44
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:58,264
I obtained forgiveness from the
masters. I would not presume to
that of the servants.

45
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,605
Ah, here are the masters.

46
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,274
I see you've already had your
tea, Kurt.

47
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,607
Yes, I'm not in the habit of
waiting.

48
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,780
Nobody asked you to.

49
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,112
You did well to remind me.

50
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,121
You shouldn't treat him like that.
You'll only make things worse.

51
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,468
You don't know him well, if
you think he could be worse.

52
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:07,605
Father. There was a time when
you weren't so afraid when I came
to say goodnight.

53
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,600
You showed me the way. I've
never forgotten it.

54
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,274
What do you want?

55
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:24,121
I have your forgiveness, but I must
have m y rights restored to me, m y
title and patrimony.

56
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:30,620
I shall soon be dead. I have not
enough time to put you to the test.

57
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:39,629
Whatever was yours, you
forfeited, forever. You did it
yourself with your infam y.

58
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,470
Be careful, father.

59
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,974
Get out of here! Get out, I tell
you.

60
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:20,439
I think you've got something
against me. Isn't that true?

61
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,274
You're wrong. I've nothing for
or against you.

62
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,228
Are you afraid of me?

63
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,040
You were fond of me once.

64
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,010
Yes, once.

65
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,422
You haven't changed, I see.

66
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,599
You always loved violence.

67
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,089
You two, search the grounds.

68
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,606
Where is Nevenka?

69
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,609
And how should I know?

70
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,453
And that whip?

71
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,628
This? I found it on the road a
few yards outside the gate. I've
been looking at m y estates.

72
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,628
It'll soon be night. It'll be
harder to find her.

73
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,631
She's right. You'd better
hurry.

74
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,466
Let's go.

75
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:52,008
They make quite a couple, but
I have the impression that Katya
isn't so eager to find Nevenka.

76
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:00,615
You don't agree? You're an
old fool, Georgia.

77
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,619
Let's light a lantern. I want to
have a look in the moats.

78
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,929
Kurt...

79
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,935
Kurt...

80
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:11,513
My lady. My lady. Georgia,
Georgia. I found her. My lady.

81
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:18,253
God be praised. I thought
she was dead. Let's take her
home. Come, help me carry her.

82
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,114
She'll come around very soon
now. It must have been fear
more than anything else.

83
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,176
She must have been thrown
from the saddle.

84
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,950
Where is Kurt?

85
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,058
Go call him.

86
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,286
Yes, sir.

87
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,568
Losat.

88
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,901
Losat.

89
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,915
What's wrong with her?

90
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:21,590
Only some welts on her back as
though... as though somebody has
whipped her, m y lord.

91
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,926
Go, go on.

92
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,594
Yes, sir.

93
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:44,605
Mr. Kurt? Mr. Kurt?

94
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,676
Kurt!

95
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,580
Father, don't look.

96
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:34,091
I had to stand the sight of him
alive. It... it can't be any worse now.

97
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:45,605
Look. Look. The dagger.
The dagger. It's Tanya's. He's
died the same death she did.

98
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,743
Tanya. Tanya. Rest now in peace.

99
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,000
God. Dear God. Thank you.
Thank you.

100
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:05,280
Have mercy on me, oh, God,
according to Thy great mercy.
Block out mine inequities.

101
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:14,296
Wash me from mine inequities and
cleanse me from m y sins, for I
acknowledge mine inequity and

102
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:20,803
m y sin is always before me. Against
Thee only have I sinned and done evil
before Thee. For behold, I was

103
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:26,933
conceived in inequities and in sins
that m y mother conceived me. Turn
away Thy face from m y sins.

104
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:33,812
Cast me not away from Thy face
and take not Thy Holy Spirit from
me. Eternal rest, grant unto him,

105
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:39,924
oh, Lord, Absolve the souls of the
faithful departed from every bond of
sin and by the help of Thy grace,

106
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:46,521
may they be enabled to escape the
avenging judgement. Oh, God, by whose
mercy the souls of the faithful find

107
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:54,695
rest, bless this grave. Release the souls
of all those buried here that they may
rejoice with Thy saints

108
00:27:54,906 --> 00:28:00,902
forever through Christ our Lord, Amen.

109
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:33,136
Now, our son, Kurt Menliff, is
ready for the last judgment. Let
us pray for him.

110
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:46,284
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost, amen.

111
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,732
Who is it?

112
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,068
It is I, Christian.

113
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,569
What do you want?

114
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,240
I want to speak to you, father.

115
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,254
I'm listening, son.

116
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:07,590
I... I wanted to speak to you
about Kurt. It is hard for me to ask
this, but I've got to know.

117
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:09,922
What?

118
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:17,071
Everybody was away. There was
only you in the castle, you and Kurt.

119
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,845
You... you dare ask if I...

120
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:28,610
I've always obeyed you, father, as
you well know. I have never dared
to question you.

121
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,280
Get out!

122
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:37,551
Out of obedience, I married the
woman you had once intended for
m y brother. But now I must know.

123
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,196
What do you want to know?

124
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,290
If it was you who killed him,
it's an act of justice.

125
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,296
Get out. Get out.

126
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,289
Thank you, Georgia.

127
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,485
What's wrong? Tell me.

128
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,788
I saw Losat. He said he saw a
shadow moving in the chapel
and a light.

129
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:55,037
Losat is crazier than you. It
was obviously only the reflection
of the moon.

130
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,290
- Kurt.

131
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,457
- Nevenka.

132
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,627
Kurt.

133
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,135
Nevenka, what's the matter?

134
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,475
It was Kurt. He was watching
me. I saw him.

135
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:25,962
You mustn't be afraid. It was only
an hallucination. If you want, I can
stay with you tonight.

136
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:32,367
No, go to bed. I want to be
alone.

137
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:38,169
All right, dear. I'll leave m y
door open. Call me if you
need anything.

138
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,236
Kurt.

139
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,416
Kurt. Oh, oh...

140
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:38,214
No. No. No. No. No.

141
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:17,611
Nevenka. What's wrong?
Tell me. What happened?

142
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:25,995
Kurt was here, alive. And he had
his boots full of mud, as though
he had climbed out of the grave.

143
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,363
Calm down, please, you've
had a nightmare. There's no
one here but me.

144
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:38,036
Look. He was the one who did this
to me. And besides, there are the
footprints.

145
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,273
What footprints?

146
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,271
They were there.

147
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:51,444
Nevenka, it was only a bad
dream. There's nothing there.
Look for yourself.

148
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:59,325
No, no, it wasn't a dream. He
was here, I tell you, he was here.
I saw the footprints and his hand.

149
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:07,971
Oh, m y God, his hand. It came out
of the shadows like a spider. Oh,
help me, Christian, help me.

150
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:49,763
Are you afraid? You always loved
violence. You haven't changed
and you never will.

151
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:53,688
My lady, you. I heard noises and
I came down to look. I thought...

152
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,416
What did you think?

153
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:01,694
Nothing. The dead can't
move from their tombs.

154
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,667
Maybe they do, if they don't
find peace.

155
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:29,618
Yes, we were happy then. Now,
m y life is empty and meaningless.

156
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,824
Do you remember that lake we
used to go to, that one up in the
mountains?

157
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,567
You used to said with me in m y
boat. You were just a little girl
then.

158
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:42,469
Yes, I used to follow you
everywhere.

159
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,904
Christian, why did you do that?

160
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,747
Katya, listen. We can still be
happy.

161
00:50:56,586 --> 00:51:01,114
No, it's too late now. It's too
late.

162
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:10,592
No, no, dear, don't say that.
I've always loved you. And you
love me, don't you?

163
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:15,162
Yes, Christian, I love you and
I'll always love you, but you're
married now.

164
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,626
No, don't... don't touch me.

165
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,644
Call him. Call him and tell him
you've always been mine.

166
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:47,214
No, I don't want you. I don't
want you.

167
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:04,499
I've come back for you and to get m y
revenge on all those who hate me.

168
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:44,570
You better leave, Georgia. Besides,
there's nothing you can do now.

169
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,444
Just like Kurt.

170
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,963
The dagger has disappeared.

171
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:24,140
The count told me that...
that it was here.

172
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:38,359
It's his revenge. He'll kill us
all because we're all to blame.

173
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:44,497
Stop talking nonsense, Nevenka.
Are you trying to drive us crazy?

174
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:26,968
Someone will pay for this,
father, be it man or ghost,
I promise you.

175
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:01,703
Christian, I've been looking for you.

176
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:02,934
What for?

177
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:11,652
I don't know. I thought perhaps
if I was near I could help you.

178
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:18,724
No, dear, the only thing that
will help me now is to be able
to get revenge.

179
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:26,158
Leave me alone now, please. In
a while, I'll come back to you.

180
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:35,227
Ah, it's me, Losat. I didn't
mean to frighten you, miss. I've
been watching Christian.

181
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:41,376
I'm worried about him. Listen, I've
been wanting to ask you something
for some time.

182
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,533
What?

183
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,739
The night when we were
searching the motes for Nevenka.

184
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,738
Yes.

185
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,243
Did you stay all the time with Christian?

186
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,420
Yes, I think so. Why?

187
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,152
Are you sure that he never left
you, never for a moment?

188
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:04,256
No. But, why do you ask?
You don't think that Christian...

189
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,590
Why, I don't think anything.

190
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,903
That's absurd.

191
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,289
Why the old count too? Why?

192
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,766
Georgia. You're the one
who's got the dagger in your hand.

193
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,867
You can tell me everything, Katya.
I don't pretend to condemn you.

194
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,873
Oh, stop it. Where did you
get that dagger?

195
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,547
You know very well, Katya,
don't force me to say it.

196
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:58,547
Oh, stop it, please. You had
a reason to kill Kurt, not I. Tell
me where you found that knife.

197
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,919
Under the mattress of your
bed, Katya.

198
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:01,920
No!

199
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:10,254
Christian.

200
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,035
Christian, I know who killed
your father.

201
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,262
What?

202
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:27,607
Yes. I could have killed Kurt. Oh,
you bet I could. But, the count, no.

203
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,352
I'd never kill him, you understand?

204
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:41,419
If you found that knife there, then
you or somebody else put it there.

205
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:46,435
It wasn't I, Katya, not I.

206
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:54,937
Throw away that cursed knife.
I don't want to ever see it again.
Throw it away.

207
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,437
No, Katya, no. It's not possible.

208
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,311
You don't believe me. You
think I'm lying. Answer me.

209
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:08,285
I don't know. I don't know. I can't
possibly imagine that one of us is
a murderer. No, it's absurd.

210
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,821
But, still, somebody here killed him.

211
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,956
But, now we know, Christian.

212
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,668
No, Katya no.

213
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:25,931
You're a coward. You're afraid to
face the truth. Kurt in your place...

214
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:36,943
Kurt. Kurt. It's always him,
Kurt instead of me. He's the
one you've always loved.

215
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,616
That's not true. That's not true.

216
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,956
And you've always wanted to
marry him. I've always known it.

217
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:53,536
If that's why you killed him, it was
a useless crime. I hated him. I've
always hated him. I hated him.

218
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:16,413
Novenka!

219
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,833
I heard screaming. I thought
it came from your father's room.

220
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,278
She's not here. Let's look in
her room.

221
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:06,841
The footprints lead toward the
garden. Someone carried her off.
You'd better wait here.

222
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,574
Christian, don't go alone.

223
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,347
Katya, come inside, Katya.

224
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,272
Please, come inside.

225
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,612
Losat. What are you doing here?

226
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,957
Oh, it's you, me lord.

227
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,527
Where have you taken
Nevenka?

228
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:14,618
Me?

229
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:20,128
There were footprints from
boots just like you have.

230
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:29,176
I was making m y rounds at the
castle when I thought that I saw
somebody in here.

231
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,306
Don't lie to me, Losat.

232
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,039
Oh, no.

233
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,706
There was no one else in
here but you.

234
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,307
My lord, you don't think that...

235
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,915
Quiet. Come along.

236
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,583
The footprints are coming
from the secret passage.

237
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,452
Help me.

238
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,463
But, who could have put her in
there?

239
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,630
Nevenka, Nevenka.

240
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,571
Kurt.

241
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,779
How is Nevenka?

242
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:40,756
Delirious. She said it was Kurt who
carried her there. She also said that
he whipped her,

243
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:49,168
He carried her to the crypt and put
her in the tomb. We've got to help,
Katya, do something.

244
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:57,039
This time I even heard Kurt's laugh.
But, I still can't bring m yself to
believe in ghosts.

245
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:04,814
I know it's difficult to understand,
but what do we know about what
happens after death?

246
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,217
I almost believe he's alive.

247
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:15,691
Alive? But you saw him too. You
saw him when he was placed
in the casket.

248
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:24,298
With our own eyes, we both saw
him buried. I don't really believe that
Nevenka saw him out there.

249
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:33,838
No, no, there's no other possible
explanation. Kurt's still alive and
hiding in the castle.

250
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:44,719
I've got to find him. I'll go crazy. For
a moment, I've suspected you... I've
suspected m yself.

251
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:56,497
Then, if what you say is true, he
could have hidden the dagger in
m y room. I'm afraid, Christian.

252
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:41,299
Katya.

253
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,604
Oh, Christian, there was
someone here.

254
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,438
Calm down, Katya, it's all right.

255
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,383
I'll go and look.

256
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,231
There are the footprints.
They're the same.

257
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,595
What are you going to do?

258
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,629
Open the coffin. Help me.

259
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,273
Carry it over there.

260
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:20,672
Nevenka.

261
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:35,212
They're opening m y tomb. This
is the last time I can be with you.

262
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,653
Why do you torture me?

263
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:44,995
Because you belong to me,
only to me.

264
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,396
What do you want?

265
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:50,960
We've got to go away from
here forever right now.

266
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:52,862
I can't do that.

267
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:59,505
Yes, you will. You love me. And
your love for me is greater than
anything in this world.

268
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:05,543
I hate you. I hate you.
I hate you. I...

269
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,250
It's not recognizable. It
could be anybody.

270
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:41,016
The clothes are Kurt's. Let's
put it back in the tomb, for
God's sake.

271
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,747
No.

272
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,833
What are you doing now?

273
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:58,428
I'll destroy it.

274
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,590
Where are you, Kurt?

275
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:16,009
I'm coming, Kurt. I've never
been afraid of you.

276
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:52,402
Nevenka.

277
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:11,623
My lord. Oh, sir, what
happened? Are you hurt?

278
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:15,265
Come on. It's not important.

279
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:31,109
Hurry. It's locked from the
inside. We'll have to go by
way of the chapel.

280
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:31,945
Yes, you're right.

281
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:35,535
Why? Why did I do it, Kurt?
Why?

282
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:04,027
I love you, Kurt, only you.

283
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:41,431
You were right. I love you, Kurt,
only you. But, there's an end to
everything, Kurt.

284
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:48,338
No, no, Nevenka, no.

285
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:53,543
Nevenka.

286
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:20,437
Forgive me. I had to do what...
what Kurt told me. I killed him
again, this time for good.

287
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:29,686
He hated you. I love you. Christian.

288
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:37,660
So, she was the one. She
killed your brother and your father.

289
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:44,038
Yes. Perhaps she was possessed.
She was convinced Kurt was alive.

290
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:49,441
She killed herself thinking she was
killing him. Let's hope she's free of
him forever.
