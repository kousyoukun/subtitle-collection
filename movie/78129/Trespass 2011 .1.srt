[incidental music]

2
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,371
(Kyle) I don't understand why we
can't continue construction.

3
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,377
We could
become partners.

4
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,415
Well if you finish
it, we can sell it.

5
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,142
You Te being
unreasonable.

6
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,914
Look, you Te
bleeding us dry!

7
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,151
Don't twist. Everyone knows real
estates in trouble. Come on!

8
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,194
We sell,
everybody wins.

9
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,559
I-I'll get you
some money.

10
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,225
Na, don’t hang up.
Goddammit.

11
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,565
[dialing and ringing]

12
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,037
Mr. Kaplan,
Kyle Miller again.

13
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,507
Yeah, hi. I'm calling about the
golconda diamond that we discussed.

14
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,103
Well I have a buyer.
I know we haven’t done business before

15
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,772
but I assure you I can be
an asset to your company.

16
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,579
Let me show you what I
can do with this stone.

17
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:18,247
No, I won't take commission. What do you have to lose?
It's my contact and my risk.

18
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,848
I guarantee
it's 100% reliable.

19
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,451
If this goes upside down,
it's on me, okay?

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,293
Hang up. Hang up.
I'm calling him now. Thanks.

21
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,095
[metallic clinking]

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,966
[engine roars]

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,803
Emile Strewart?
Kyle Miller. How are you?

24
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,104
(Avery) Hey, Mom,
can I go to a party?

25
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,145
(Sarah) Come on, Avery.
Nat tonight.

26
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,441
Please?

27
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:47,280
It's at this guy Jake's house.
Everyone's going.

28
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,411
Who's everyone?

29
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,955
Friends from school.

30
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,887
Why are you being
so vague about it?

31
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,654
I'm not. Hang on.
I'm getting water-boarded.

32
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,387
[chuckles]

33
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,055
Please? It's
no big thing.

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,463
Yeah? Well if
it's no big thing,

35
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,399
why can't you tell me who
you're going with? Hm?

36
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,564
So, that little
daydream we discussed.

37
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,938
Yes, the flawless one.

38
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:14,070
Well, it turns out it could
be yours provided that, uh--

39
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,080
Just a minute.

40
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,777
Provided that you come up
with a less insulting number.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,083
No, you're gonna have to do a
little bit better than that, Emile,

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,918
or my seller's
gonna walk.

43
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,980
It's just a party.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,991
With Kendra?

45
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,619
Why do you have such a
problem with Kendra?

46
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:35,632
Avery, I just thought we could have dinner at
home tonight as a family. Your Dad's back.

47
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,464
I thought
it'd be nice.

48
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,596
I don't wanna have dinner.
I wanna go to a party.

49
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,301
Well, I said no.

50
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,138
(Kyle) Emile. Emile.

51
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,506
Fine, I'll ask Dad.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,511
Okay. Ask him.

53
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:52,140
Emile, Stafford's offering two
percent above your price.

54
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,652
Yes! That Stafford.
Carl Stafford.

55
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,324
Mom's being arbitrary
and inflexible.

56
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,017
[scoffs]
Oh, come on.

57
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,219
[whispering]
I need hugs.

58
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,990
What difference does it make if
Carl said it or he didn't say it?

59
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,294
The point is you're
getting a damn good rock.

60
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,562
Uh, just a minute.

61
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,694
Did you wear
that to school?

62
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,204
Can I go to
a friend's party?

63
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,740
No.

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,832
I have to go with
your mother on this.

65
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,572
No! I wanna
meet with you.

66
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,578
You don't know what we
we're talking about.

67
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,342
Yes. We were
talking about Kendra.

68
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,475
That means boys,
probably older,

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,487
and that is every father's worst nightmare.
I'm sorry, Sweetie.

70
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,319
Yes, yes. I’m back.
No, tonight is fine.

71
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,155
Uh, I could be there
in 30, 45 with traffic.

72
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,752
Whatever you two are going through
treating me like a child,

73
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,558
isn't gonna make
anything any better.

74
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,690
Are we going
through something?

75
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,200
I don't know.
Are we?

76
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,399
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
it's just--

77
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,031
it's just a bit crazy
here at the office today.

78
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:54,170
Yes. Well, I don't think
you're really hearing me.

79
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,077
Emile, this is
the flawless.

80
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,410
It's whiter than the
snow an Mount Fuji.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,016
Are you cartooning me?
This is a 2A diamond

82
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,955
so clear you will weep.
You will just weep.

83
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,788
I mean, in any other circumstance
a four karat golconda

84
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,226
is 1.5 million dollars.
I mean, this is a steal.

85
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,231
I'm inviting you to steal from me.
Yes, cash.

86
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,699
[muffled voice]
This is a basement price.

87
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,862
I'm not even taking
a commission.

88
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,633
No, it has to be cash.

89
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,369
Thank you. Thank you, Emile.
I'm glad we could come to an understanding.

90
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,311
And you won't be
disappointed. Good-bye.

91
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,210

(Sarah)
Kyle ?

97
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,458
I'm on the phone.

98
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,663
I just wondered if you wanted
something to eat before you go out.

99
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,830
Uh, no, I'll pick
something up.

100
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,307
[suspenseful music]

101
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,295
Please don't say it's all because you
love me and you're worried about me.

102
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,298
Honey, you have
to eat something.

103
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,562
I'm not hungry.

104
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,469
All right.
Well, I'm just gonna leave it here.

105
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,735
It's yummy.

106

[sighs]

107
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,046
Avery, you're so pretty and
you're so smart and you--

108
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,009
You just don't have to be
in such a hurry to grow up.

109
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,589
I love you, baby.

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,889
I know, Mom.
I love you, too.

Hey.

116
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,965
They think you're
a bad influence.

117
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,098
They're right.

118

[giggling]

119
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,307
You know, I'm
actually pretty sure

120
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,677
that my mom is having sex
with her divorce lawyer.

121
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,443
Do you have his number?
My mom's gonna need one.

00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,293
Wow.

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,201
How was Houston?

128
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,970
Just supplying diamonds for oil
men's mistresses. [scoffs]

129
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,711
How's Avery?

130
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,545
Oh, she's still in her room.
[scoffs]

131
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,312
She hates me.

132
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,844
No, she doesn't hate you.
She hates both of us.

133
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,016
Uh. I found this.

134
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,584
Do you think
she's smoking?

135
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,663
I hope not.

136
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,256
It's not just this.
There were cigarettes out by the pool.

137
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,595
Really?

138
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,929
Uh-huh.

139
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,601
I'm worried
about her.

140
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,572
Yeah.

141
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,541
Here.

142
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,549
This guy's only in town tonight, otherwise
the whole deal, just, you know?

143
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,551
You look so beautiful.

144
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,615
I do?

145
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,356
What I do, that I leave,
that I can't always be here,

146
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,456
it's all for you
and Avery.

147
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,934
To take care of you.
You know that?

148
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,062
I know.

149
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,482
Hey. Hm?

150
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,751
I have to go.

151
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,229
I wonder how many times
this has to happen before

152
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,893
[sighs] I'm not really
gonna care anymore.

153
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,164
What does that mean?

[phone ringing]

00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,748
Yes. Hello?

156
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,013
(man)
Mr. Kyle Miller?

157
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,644
Yes.

158
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,484
Sheriff’s Department,
Mr. Miller.

159
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,957
May we came in
to speak with you?

160
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,756
What's this about?

161
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,263
How many people are at
your house at this time?

162
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,959
My wife and daughter and myself
Is there a problem, officer?

163
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,968
Kyle, what's
going on?

164
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,163
Sir, we 're talking to all
the families in the area

165
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,002
because there? been
a rash of burglaries.

166
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,098
Get Avery.

167
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,940
Mr. Miller?

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,981
Yes, all right. All right.
Just- just a minute.

169
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,185
[suspenseful music]

170
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,657
Avery!

171
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,131
[rattles doorknob]
Oh.

172
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,829
Avery come on,
open up.

173
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,201
Avery.
[knocking]

174
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,570
Come on,
don't be silly.

175
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,405
Avery! Come on! it 's locked!

176
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,072
Well, will you just get her to open it?
I want her down here now.

177
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,547
Yeah. Yeah.
Avery, come on!

178
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,221
[doorbell ringing]

179
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,194
She's gone!

180
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:05,498
Sarah, run!
Run, Sarah!

181
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,663
(man)
Shut the fuck up.

182
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,003
Don't fucking
do anything.

183
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,101
Get her!
Get after her!

184
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,770
I'm will put
a hole in you.

185
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,849
Don't fucking look at me.
Get the cash.

186
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,617
[shrieks]

187
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,220
[starts engine]

188
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,191
[tires screeching]

189
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,937
[shouts and brakes]

190
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,236
[panting]

191
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,538
I told you
it was happening.

192
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,479
What is happening is
you almost killed us.

193
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,744
Do not embarrass me and
go acting your age.

194
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,080
What age
should do I act?

195
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,552
Legal!

196
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,249
[loud pop music]

197
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,916
What up, ladies?

198
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,584
I'm glad you all
could make it here.

199
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,220
My name is Jake.
Welcome to my party.

200
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,164
Hey, Jake. I, uh,
I invited them. Jake.

201
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,667
Yeah! It's all cool.

202
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,398
Kendra.
Follow me, please.

203
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,169
I would absolutely love to show you something.
Check this out.

204
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,937
In your
fucking knees.

205
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,603
Face down.

206
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,648
[panting]

207
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,783
We need that
in case security calls.

208
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,187
Okay. Let's all get really clear
on one thing here. All right?

209
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,021
This is my house now.
it's my house, it's my rules.

210
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,594
Daddy's home!

211
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,323
Kid's gone.

212
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:46,931
So, do you have any idea where
your underage daughter is

213
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,200
and when
she is coming back?

214
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,105
No, I don't know.

215
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,839
Don't you just
love surprises?

216
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,208
She'll be back.

217
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,875
Hey, 15 minutes.
In and out.

218
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,213
No bullshit.

219
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,515
All right.
Cell phones on the floor, now!

220
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,521
Now! Cell phones!

221
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,720
I don't have one!

222
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,022
Liar!

223
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,323
I don't
have one on me.

224
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,887
(man)
You don't have one?

225
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,057
All right.
We'll see about that.

226
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,999
Shall we, Sarah? Spread.
Oh, that's a nice ass.

227
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,401
Do not--

228
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,166
No! No! No!

229
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,367
Don't you ever fucking
do that again, Kyle.

230
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,967
If I see a gun,
if I see a hand,

231
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,637
I will fucking
put a hole in you.

232
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,681
Do I make myself
clear, asshole?

233
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,013
Shut the fuck up!

234
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,985
[sighs]
They're feisty.

235
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,522
[phone ringing]

236
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,923
Okay. Get that.
Get it.

237
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,018
Kill it.
And the rest, too.

238
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,223
[phone ringing]

239
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,928
All right. Let's
try that alarm now.

240
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,202
After all, we wanna know when
little Avery gets home, right?

241
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,041
You'd be surprised the things
I know about you, Kyle,

242
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,207
and what I don't know,
you're gonna tell me.

243
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,577
Like, what's
the alarm code?

244
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,417
What's the alarm code?

245
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,187
[thumps and crashing]

246
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,526
You know, Kyle, I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

247
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,929
What did you say
the code was?

248
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,023
I can't hear you!
What's the fucking code?

249
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,125
774...

250
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,898
65!
7465!

251
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,770
7465? You sure
about that?

252
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,934
Yes.

253
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,603
All right. You sure about that?
You're sure about that.

254
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,648
I just wanna be sure because we
really, really hate surprises.

255
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,548
7465!

256
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,553
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! No!

257
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,919
Wait! Wait! Wait!
No! No! What?

258
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,983
What? You hear the cops?
You hear anything? You hear a siren?

259
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,824
I don’t hear a siren.
You know why I don't hear a siren ?

260
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,559
Because there are
two codes here, Kyle.

261
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,400
One that's real and one that acts
real, only it calls the police!

262
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,339
Nam we happen
to know your code.

263
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,069
And we happen to know a
lot about you, Kyle.

264
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,339
Please don't fucking
underestimate us, okay?

265
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,075
Don't waste your time.
Get up. See?

266
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,017
This is what we call a
little trust exercise, Kyle.

267
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,020
Now, relationships are
essentially built on trust.

268
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,250
And once that
trust is broken,

269
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,989
it's very, very
hard to get back.

270
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,995
Isn't that
right, Sarah?

271
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,032
What do you
want from us?

272
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,034
I don't know. Why don't we
start with everything you got?

273
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,603
[beeping sound]

274
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,265
Old man has no idea
I know the combo.

275
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,468
Do you want some blow?

276
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,204
See that?

277
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,370
There's 100K in there
and a stash of cipro

278
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,106
just in case
the terrorists

279
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,446
completely destroy
the financial universe

280
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,817
and mail him some anthrax.
it's unbelievable.

281
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,378
You want
some of this?

282
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,388
Oh, no. I'm okay.
Just gonna go see

283
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,550
what Kendra? doing
maybe or something.

284
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,127
Look. I know.

285
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,026
I like you, too. I do.

286
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:03,066
And I know you just met
me, but I can tell.

287
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,897
You want this.
You do.

288
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,131
And, you know, maybe
neither one of us

289
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,970
exactly saw this night
going like this,

290
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,477
but you gotta ask
yourself, I mean,

291
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,346
do you really want tonight to
be about what could've been?

292
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,816
Huh?

293
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,581
[chuckling softly]

294
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,713
[dialing]

295
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,518
(woman)
Dispatch.

296
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,651
Yeah. I'd
like a taxi.

297
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,422
One moment please.

298
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,929
Picking up
at what address?

299
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,499
Where are you going?

300
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,262
Somewhere
I can throw up.

301
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,428
Well... I got a bathroom.

302
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,498
Watch out
for the kid.

303
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,099
Leave me!

304
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,076
Baby, just do
what he says, okay?

305
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,613
You know what, Kyle?

306
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,281
Isn't this a little bit obvious?
You have a safe behind your picture.

307
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,187
It's-it's aesthetic.

308
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,920
Aesthetic?

309
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,256
It's not about hiding
it from people.

310
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,854
It's a... there's not
a giant safe staring--

311
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,924
Ten minutes.

312
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,902
[whispering] What
are we gonna do?

313
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,633
You know, Kyle?
I'm impressed with you.

314
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,571
You have a Benelli
pointed at your forehead

315
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,201
and you still have the
audacity to condescend to me.

316
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:24,976
Your either really, really
stupid or you're suicidal.

317
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,642
Come on,
open the safe.

318
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,118
Open me safe.

319
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,052
[sighs]

320
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,613
Open in

321
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,591
Now, this doesn't have
to be hard, all right?

322
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:42,121
Just get in there
and open the safe.

323
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,600
Hell, you can probably claim
whatever you get in insurance.

324
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:49,071
You'll get the cash all back, so
it's a win-win situation, right?

325
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,935
Now, the combination.

326
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,590
No.

327
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,930
[cocks rifle]

328
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,801
[scoffs]
No?

329
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,272
No.

330
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,206
One "no" is not
an option, Kyle.

331
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,978
Please. Don't make us
be obvious about this.

332
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,641
I don't know it!
I don't know it!

333
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,685
What do you expect
to find?

334
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,880
We know things about you, okay?
I told you that, asshole!

335
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,821
We saw you sign for diamonds.
Lots of them!

336
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,393
I know you've got diamonds in there
smaller than my pinkie fingernail

337
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,895
that are worth more than
a Porsche, all right?

338
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,125
I don't give a shit
what's in the safe

339
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,135
as long as you fucking open it, so
I'm gonna ask you one more time

340
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,469
really nicely.
Open the goddamn safe, pretty please.

341
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,032
Please. Please! Kyle.

342
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,542
[suspenseful music]

343
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,203
Who's cutting them?

344
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,372
You gotta be
kidding me.

345
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,680
These diamonds,
who's cutting them ?

346
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,688
Kyle Miller.

347
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,247
You really don't wanna
get smart with me now.

348
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,884
You really wanna stay as
stupid as fucking possible.

349
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,020
I stay stupid,
you go to jail.

350
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:24,000
So, I assume you have someone
to deal with the inscriptions?

351
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,195
Eight. minutes.

352
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,171
Tell me you thought this through.
You came here to steal diamonds.

353
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,230
You must know
something about them.

354
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,537
What does it take to shut
this prick up, Sarah?

355
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,840
Yes, I'll shut up, because
there's another way.

356
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,245
You can learn about the
micro-laser inscriptions

357
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,045
when you Te being arrested for
trying to pass off stolen goods.

358
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,882
We're wasting time.
[cocks rifle]

359
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,888
Wait. No. I wanna hear it.
I need to hear it.

360
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,184
No more talking.

361
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,452
No! Don't hurt him!

362
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,551
Anyone with a jeweler's loupe is gonna
know that the stones are stolen

363
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,392
and who you
stole them from.

364
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,557
Every diamond on the market
in the United States

365
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,067
is registered with the Gemological
Institute of America.

366
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,468
The weight, the
shape, the grade,

367
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,130
fluorescence
and ownership

368
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,709
are documented, filed,
etched into the stone.

369
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,109
You get caught trying
to pass off my diamonds

370
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,875
how soon before they
connect you to my murder?

371
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,883
Open the safe.
No one gets murdered.

372
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,044
Wait. What's he
talking about?

373
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,884
Just-just let him talk.
I need to hear this.

374
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,823
[deep sigh]

375
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:25,225
The only way to sell stolen
diamonds is to change the shape,

376
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,662
shave off
the inscription.

377
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,666
Even so, if you try to sell recut
diamonds without a certificate,

378
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,932
the buyer's gonna know they're stolen,
he's gonna be the bell of your bought.

379
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:38,464
And yes, yes, there are several
hundred thousand dollars

380
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,840
worth of diamonds in this safe.
But how much do you think a bunch of, you know,

381
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,847
pardon my French, hooligans
are gonna get for them

382
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,645
assuming you can even find a buyer who's
interested in stolen goods to begin with?

383
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:53,918
Huh? Ten thousand? I doubt it.
Ten hundred? Maybe. Probably not!

384
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,689
In your hands, they go back
to being nothing but rocks.

385
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,355
Just-just pretty,
shiny little rocks.

386
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,764
[sniffs] So, I'm
gonna ask you again.

387
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,770
Who's cutting
them for you?

388
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,363
Every minute we stay
past the first 20,

389
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,442
ups our risk 10%,
which is

390
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,774
six minutes
from right now.

391
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,041
Kyle.

392
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,310
[suspenseful music]

393
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,285
Why are you
telling us this?

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,879
Because I'm that guy.

395
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,117
I'm the one who can get the stones recut
without anyone tracing them lo us.

396
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,821
We'll be partners.
I'll sell the diamonds, give you the cash.

397
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,989
Report them stolen,
claim the insurance.

398
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,660
[panting] Everybody wins
and everybody lives.

399
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,532
That is fucking brilliant.

400
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,969
Let me get this straight.
We take the diamonds

401
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,507
and then we give them
back to you?

402
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,736
[scoffs] Look.
We do not need this asshole

403
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:51,247
and whatever bullshit he is selling
because there is cash. Okay?

404
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:56,082
I don't know how much but it's enough
to give this disk jockey a workout.

405
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:59,486
It's enough to make us tonight's
fucking lottery winners.

406
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,320
Fuck the diamonds.

407
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,827
Let's get the cash and
get the fuck outta here.

408
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:10,766
[suspenseful music
intensifying]

409
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,978
All right.

410
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,983
You had your show.
You made your offer.

411
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,315
I refuse.
Now, open the safe.

412
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,789
You don't have any rope, handcuffs,
nothing to tie us up with.

413
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,416
I know what you're
going to do.

414
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,085
Open the safe.

415
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,562
No.

416
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,826
You son of a bitch.

417
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,925
You son of a bitch!

418
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,561
Please. Please!

419
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,004
Please. Please. Please.

420
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,338
Just put the gun down.
Let her go and I'll open it.

421
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:27,843
Four minutes.

422
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,174
Do you have
any last words, Sarah?

423
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,840
Kyle, give them what they want.
Please. Open the safe!

424
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,851
They'll kill us, Sarah.
They'll just kill us if I do.

425
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,114
It's called trust!

426
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,953
Okay? Trust me, Kyle.
Trust me.

427
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:46,156
And trust that I will fucking
kill her, right now if you don't!

428
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,787
You promised me!

429
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,129
Stay there!
Just open the goddamn safe!

430
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,998
If you let her go!

431
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,367
That lock is the only
reason we're still alive.

432
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,930
I open it, we lose leverage.
We lose leverage, we die.

433
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,705
I want you to look at this
very pretty face here, okay?

434
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,372
Now, can you imagine what
a 125 gram hollow point

435
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,610
is gonna do to this?
it's gonna fucking destroy it, all right?

436
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,279
We are moments away!
How about that for leverage?

437
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,652
This is a negotiation.

438
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,816
You have the power to take our lives,
but I have the power to make you rich.

439
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,122
Let her take the car and
drive away and I'll do that.

440
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,958
I'll open the safe
and make you rich.

441
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,522
Oh, her? You sure
she's worth it, Kyle?

442
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,794
A million dollars?
Yes, that's right, kid!

443
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,894
You did it!
You hit the motherload!

444
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,666
You saw me sign for a
million with your own eyes.

445
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,867
And it's right there
just inches away.

446
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,002
All you have to do
is just let my wife go!

447
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,411
And then, come on
down and grab it!

448
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,504
Come on! Elias!

449
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,810
No!

450
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,909
No! No! No!

451
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,920
Of all the stupid mistakes, that
man just about said your name.

452
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,389
So you get your people in order!
You let my wife leave.

453
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,858
And then I'll give you
what you want.

454
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,419
Hey, go get
the magic wand.

455
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,057
[suspenseful music]

456
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,011
Succinylcholine.

457
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,783
It's a paralytic.

458
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,948
On the operating table

459
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,619
it makes you think that someone
else is getting all cut up

460
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,890
instead of you.
Now, it's a hell of a kick

461
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,591
and this much
would kill you,

462
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,294
but with Papa Bear
and Mama Bear

463
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,895
and little Baby Bear,
it's just about right.

464
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,942
It'll knock you flat,
give you a hell of a ride

465
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,136
but it won't kill you.

466
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:46,649
So this is the rope,
the handcuffs

467
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,979
which I have
to say, Kyle,

468
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,782
are a little bit kinky,
don't you think?

469
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,414
[laughing]

470
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,756
But he was good,
though. Huh?

471
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,317
Wasn't he good?

472
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,397
You are
a piece of work.

473
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,489
'Get your people
in order!"

474
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,795
The man's a born
deal maker.

475
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,763
[young Avery over TV,
chattering unintelligibly]

476
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,854
One minute.

477
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,853
Come on, hero.
You open that big guy up, okay?

478
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,691
I'm gonna stick you with this shit.
You'll fall asleep.

479
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,765
By the time you wake
up, we're in Mexico.

480
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,166
This is all a bad
dream with insurance.

481
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,432
I want you to listen to me,
listen to me really good, okay?

482
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:46,772
You may have noticed that I don't really
have control over the big guy, okay?

483
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,211
So you have to ask yourself why
I'm gonna bring someone like that

484
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:54,717
to a job like this.
Maybe I don't have a choice, all right?

485
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,844
Now, I don't wanna
hurt you or your wife.

486
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,219
But he does
and he will.

487
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,054
I'm not giving you anything
until after you let her go.

488
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,185
Come on, man, don't
do this to yourself.

489
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,322
[beeping]

490
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:10,333
Time's up.

Kyle! Kyle!

497
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,511
[suspenseful music continues]

498
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,486
Leave her alone!
Leave her the fuck alone.

499
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,146
What the fuck
are you doing?

500
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,020
Keep his dirty fucking
hands off of her.

501
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,581
You agreed
to shut your mouth.

502
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,558
Please, help me.
Help us.

503
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,687
You told me nobody was gonna touch her.
You promised!

504
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,891
You're gonna shut
your fucking mouth.

505
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,262
Did you take
your pills?

506
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,336
Yes, I took
my fucking pills!

507
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,395
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

508
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,270
[panting] If you touch her,
I will fucking kill you.

509
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,709
[all panting]

510
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,876
Fuck!

511
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,940

[sobbing, pounding, panting]

516
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,477
(Sarah) Well, the contractor
keeps calling and calling.

517
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:40,250
I don't know what you
want me to do here, Kyle.

518
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:44,818
Come one. This is
what you wanted.

519
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,726
I thought we were happier
in the old house.

520
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,494
Don't yell at me.

521
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:53,798
I was just asking, Kyle.
What do you--

522
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:58,102
[sighs] Okay. Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

523
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,006
Bye.

524
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,338

[sniffs]
Oh.

527
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,689
Um, no,
I'm sorry, I--

528
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,352
I couldn't
help overhear.

529
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,452
Are you-you okay?

530
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,931
Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, I'm fine.

531
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,695
Okay.

532
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,929
Did you design this whole
place by yourself?

533
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,996
The house? Yeah. I did. [sniffs]

534
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,701
You are very talented.

535
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,607
Thank you.

536
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,839
It's a little bigger
than we needed, but--

537
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,973
Well, if you're gonna
dream, dream big. Right?

538
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,984
Yeah.

539
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,281
I'm all finished
here today, so.

540
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,686
Well, thank you.

541
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,450
Well, I'll
see you tomorrow.

542

[crickets chirping]

[panting]

546
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,816
Take that off!

547
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,510
Oh, did I remind you
of someone?

548
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,645
Take it off!

549
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,155
It's not yours.

550
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,385
[provocatively]
It is now.

551
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,661
Are you sure this is
the right location?

552
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,827
Uh-huh.

553
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,700
Look, if it's about the money, I'll
take you where you want to go.

554
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,037
No, no, my my house
is right here. I'm fine.

555
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,234
You sure?

556
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,867
Uh-huh. Thank you.

557
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,079
No. No. No.

558
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,411
I'm taking Sarah for a
little walk with me.

559
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,507
No!

560
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,916
Sarah!

561
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,078
Kyle!

562
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,780
Come with me.

563
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,357
(Sarah)
Help!

564
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:02,391
You know, you don't see a lot of
biometrics on home security systems.

565
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,956
Fingerprint scanner?

566
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,035
Ugh.
[thump]

567
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,129
[suspenseful music]

568
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,743
You know, you're gonna put your thumb
on that thing sooner or later.

569
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:25,150
The only question is, whether it
will still be attached to your body.

570
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,282
[suspenseful music]

571
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,402
Serve me.
Serve me.

572
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,166
Pour me some wine.
I want you to serve me.

573
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,137
Would you serve me?

574
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,566
Would you serve me?

575
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,441
Like you served
my baby brother?

576
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,980
[panting]
Huh?

577
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,913
Yes, you recognized
him. I saw you.

578
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,246
[panting]
No.

579
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,581
Yes.

580
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,416
No, I didn't.

581
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,479
Drop the fucking thing.
Don't even try.

582
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,253
Drop the fucking knife or I'll
bite your fucking ear off.

583
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,295
You know why
we're here, Sarah,

584
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,489
because you fucked around
with my little brother.

585
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,759
And for that reason, I have to tell
you something. You're gonna die.

586
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,463
And I think you know deep down
inside you that you deserve to die.

587
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,097
And I need you to tell
me "I deserve to die.”

588
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,664
You go to hell.

589
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,970
Not go to hell, Sarah.
Not go to hell.

590
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,205
I'm not doing this
for me, Sarah.

591
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,805
It's for you. There's a reason they
send priests to guys on death row.

592
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:31,114
It's their last chance for moral clarity.
Let's get really clear on one thing here.

593
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,020
Only you can save
your husband

594
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,525
and your little girl.
We will come back for your little fucking girl

595
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,120
and she doesn't deserve
to die, does she?

596
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,292
No. No.

597
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,667
So, I need you
to say it.

598
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,205
[sobbing]
What?

599
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:53,299
I need you to say it.
I deserve--

600
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,208
[panting]
I...

601
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,472
[whispering]
Say it.

602
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,175
Say it.

603
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,080
I

604
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,751
deserve

605
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:09,087
[whispering]
to die. Say it, Sarah.

606
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,161
[loud]
I deserve

607
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,890
[whispering]
to die.

608
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,989
[panting]

609
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,662
Good girl.
Good girl.

610
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,263
Now, you're gonna help
me get that money, okay?

611
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,602
How do I do that?

612
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,768
I think you'll
find a way.

613
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:30,608
And I will make sure
that your husband

614
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:34,343
and your little girl are taken care of.
And they will never have to know--

615
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,885
You promise?

616
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,921
Yes. And I think
you'll find a way

617
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:41,218
'cause I think you know your
way around men, don't you?

618
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,088
Now, you
come with me.

619
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,393
I'd prefer not
to make a mess.

620
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,725
But I do
when I have to.

621
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,697
Nothing personal.

622
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,563
I'm a collector,
you see?

623
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,625
I'm here to collect on a debt.

624
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,068
Ugh!

625
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,901
Ah!
[thump]

626
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,600
Hey, I don't owe
you anything.

627
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,041
Who said
it was your debt?

628
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,134
(Kyle)
Sarah! Sarah!

629
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,372
No. Kyle. Yeah.

630
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,882
[panting]

631
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,817
[man downstairs]
Tell me where they are.

632
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,410
Tell me where
they are!

633
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,387

[Kyle shouting]
Run, Avery!

00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,557

Run, Avery!

636
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,653

00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,964
Shit.

640
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,281
Where did you go? Huh?
Where did you go? Sweetie?

641
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,249
Did we scare you?

I promise
we won't hurt you.

644
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,091
Where the fuck are you?

00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,767
All right.
Come on.

[Avery shouting]
No!

648
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:08,141
Avery! Avery!
Oh, my God!

649
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,011
Avery! You shit
fucking animals!

(Sarah)
It's all right.

653
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,045
Sweetie.

00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,215

Av--Avery.

00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,485
[panting]

657
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,624
It's all right, baby.
It's all right. I got you.

658
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:35,160
[Avery sobbing]

659
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,206
[Sarah and Avery crying]

660
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,969
Okay, man. Okay, okay. Hey. Hey.

661
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,840
You know what?
You did good. All right?

662
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,005
You did good.
You held your ground.

663
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,673
Now it's just your bad luck that
your little girl showed up, okay?

664
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,345
I'm glad that you feel
this way, though.

665
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,410
Now you know
how I feel, man.

666
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,421
I'm a family man,
too, okay?

667
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,389
That's why we're here.

668
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,757
My Mom--

669
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,989
My Mom got herself
beat up every night

670
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,589
by her drunken,
asshole husband.

671
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,225
Because she thought that
if she was getting beat up,

672
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,167
we weren't
getting beat up.

673
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,763
And she got beat and she
got beat and she got beat

674
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,933
until she got
renal failure.

675
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,342
You know what that means?
She needs a new fucking kidney, Kyle,

676
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,938
which is where
you come in.

677
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,108
I got a broker that's
gonna get us one

678
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:24,244
but it's gonna cost us
$180,000, all right?

679
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:28,347
So, I have a choice.
I have to leave here with a $180,000

680
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:33,054
or a new kidney, and I don't care
which, but I have to tell you, man,

681
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,258
the younger the
kidney, the better.

682
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,765
You're full of shit.

683
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,961
No, I'm not, man.
Why do you think

684
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:44,131
I brought the guy with the
knife and the tranquilizer?

685
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:47,039
Now, for her sake

686
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,237
I'm gonna ask you
one more time

687
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,543
open the fucking safe.

688
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,445
Open me safe.

689
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,046
[suspenseful music]

690
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,591
No!

691

Motherfucker!
You're a motherfucker!

692
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,091
I'll shoot you up with this
and you'll never wake up.

693
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,464
Isn't that what you said?
So you let my daughter go.

694
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,230
I swear to God
I'm gonna do it.

695
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,670
(man)
Somebody shoot her!

696
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,004
Five! Go away.
Come on, let her go.

697
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,941
You're all gonna
fucking die with me.

698
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,503
Come on, Avery.
Go on. Two!

No one's killing
your girl.

Nobody 's killing her.

(Sarah) Avery get up.
Came on, you gotta run. Run!

704
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,152
Don't you fucking
touch her!

705
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,026
Kyle! Run!

706
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,326
What the fuck
are you doing?

707
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,798
What needs
to be done.

708
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,699
Avery, baby,
I need you to run.

709
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,169
Run, baby. Run
as fast as you can.

710
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,603
Go! Go!

711
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,141
I can't, Mom.

712
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,507
You can do it.
You can do it, baby.

Run! Run!

714
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,152
Now, drop the needle,
open the safe,

715
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,552
or I bring her back.

716

house, in my family.

no fucking money.

Everything is mortgaged.
It 's all borrowed.

We never owned this house.
It owned us! We're broke.

Bullshit! Bullshit!

It was a family business.
I'm not family. Honey, they fired me.

They found someone
that could do it cheaper.

Yeah, you saw me, fucker!

for us.

00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,556
What the hell has she got
to do with any of this?

794
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,617
Well, yeah. What do you call it?

795
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,560
You call it
leverage, right?

796
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,793
If it's a kidney you want,
then take mine, ass fuck!

797
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,630
Kyle!

798
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,102
Really? You 're
really ready?

799
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,538
Yeah. Do it, shithole!

800
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,534
You ready for that?
Now this knife,

801
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,376
does it have to be
sterilized or is it good?

802
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,882
You might want to turn away.
Get some ice!

803
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,545
Okay. That's the way
you want it, yuppie.

804
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,882
Are you...

Ugh.

Don't look,

807
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,420
Okay, the kidney's on this side, right?

00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,798
You thought
I want your kidney?

812
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:49,895
My Mom, she died because
she was a fat ass drunk.

813
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,135
It's okay. It's okay.
[phone ringing]

814
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,939
I'm still here.

815
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,848
I don't know.
Let me ask him.

816
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,647
How're we doing?

817
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,483
Under control.

818
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,923
It's under control.
That's what Elias says.

819
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,826
We'll be there.

820
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:17,596
You got an hour.

Look at it. The y 're fucking rich.
You Te lying!

You are lying!

826
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,206
Get that girl
under control.

827
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,443
You said you have
things under control?

828
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,953
Get it under control.

829
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:47,296
[panting] We're not the
only hostages here.

It's not...You're not
fucking helping me.

838
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,421
Baby, there's a fucking car.
It's a Porsche.

839
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,427
We can get money
for the Porsche.

840
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:23,158
What are we gonna do with it?
Have a fucking yard sale?

841
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,996
I don't know, baby.
I'm really scared.

842
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,831
I just wanna
get out of here.

843
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,201
I wanna go, too.
But you're safer here with me.

844
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,103
They can't get you
here. All right?

845
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,004
Tye is gonna
fucking kill you.

846
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,509
Don't worry about
Tye. I got Tye.

847

Please. You can't
die on me, okay?

848
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,738
I'm not gonna die.
Do I look like I'm gonna die?

849
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,440
I'm not gonna
fucking die.

850
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:43,712
I don't know what I'll
do without you, baby.

851
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,414
Please, this is fucking wrong.
Let's just go.

We can be in Mexico.
At least, we can, we can..

What's this
thing worth?

We had a deal.
You would let my family go.

No. You

Please. Please?
Maybe you have a child.

Run. Run. Run.

952
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,164
All right?

953
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,299
I swear to God--

954
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,866
Go.

955
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,146
You hurt her
and I will kill you.

956
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,014
I'll kill you!

957
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,643
Do I look scared?

958
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,051
Oh.

959
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,555
[suspenseful music]

960
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,021
What?

961
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,429
[panting]

962
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,592
On your knees.

963
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:14,344
[soft music, birds chirping]

964
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:31,190
[buzz]

965
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,031
You're a stupid asshole, you
brought this on yourself.

966
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,367
I didn't want it like this. Okay?

967
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,134
So you can
save yourselves,

968
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,435
but how much do you care
about your daughter?

969
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:41,805
You can
still save her.

970
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:43,378
I told you.
We have nothing.

971
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,913
Okay.
[cocks gun]

972
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,710
That's the way
you wanna play it.

973
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,408
I'm gonna
take the necklace.

974
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,474
I'm gonna leave
three bodies.

975
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,652
If you're gonna kill me, why don't you
fucking look me in the eye, you coward!

976
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,624
It's fake.

977
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,059
Come again?

978
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,826
The necklace.
It's fake.

979
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,993
The stones are
cubic zirconia.

980
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:09,594
Ninety-nine bucks a pop
on the shopping network.

981
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,571
[whispering]
Bullshit.

982
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,573
Fuck you.

983
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,443
Are you okay?

984
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,817
Don't fucking worry
about me, honey, okay?

985
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:31,190
You sure? Because I know where
my Mom hides the Vicodin.

986
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,957
Do you expect
me to believe

987
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,194
that you bought
your wife fakes?

988
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,999
I sold the real ones.
That's a copy.

989
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,507
Do you know anything

990
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:51,375
about the etymology
of the word ”diamond?“

991
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,312
Why don't you
educate me, asshole?

992
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,717
It comes from the Greek
adamas meaning 'unbreakable'

993
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,222
'cause real ones
are so hard

994
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:05,953
they won't break.

995
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,501
They won't break.

996
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,127
All right.

997
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,899
[cocks gun]
We're done.

998
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,531
No!
[gunshot]

999
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,079
Hey, man,
it's still my show!

1000
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:26,079
It's still my show.

1001
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,481
Then wrap it up.

1002
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,190
Does that look like the hardest
substance in the world to you?

1003
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:46,894
[chuckles]

1004
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,834
You know what?
This doesn't save you.

1005
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,038
Hey, Kyle.

1006
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:02,014
You know, your loving wife,
she fucked my baby brother.

1007
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,382
That's why we're here.

1008
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,921
That's why we picked you.
[chuckles softly]

1009
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,389
[clicking tongue]

1010
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,259
Kyle, he's lying.
Look at me.

1011
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,259
It's up there.
You want me to get it?

1012
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,461
What? And untie you?
How dumb do you think I am, huh?

1013
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,638
[shouting and crashing]

1014
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,571
[shouting]

1015
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,440
Stupid bitch!
You fucking bitch!

1016
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:30,876
Get that
tweaking bitch.

1017
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,984
[alarm going oft]

1018
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,747
[alarm continues]

[beeping]

1020
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,732
Ugh.

1021
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:12,781
I'm getting a lot
of money to do this.

1022
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:14,288
And you...

1023
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,187
[bones cracking]
Ah!

1024
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,454
You, I'm gonna do it for free.
You, I'm gonna enjoy.

1025
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,860
Ah!

1026
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:25,957
[alarm continues,
phone ringing]

1027
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,525
[alarm stops]

[phone ringing]

1029
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,705
[phone continues ringing]

1030
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,674
Hello?

1031
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:43,377
(woman) Good evening, sir.
This is Guardalert Security.

1032
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,714
Uh, we're gonna
have to call you back.

1033
00:55:56,887 --> 00:56:00,994
Am I talking now,
Kyle? Huh?

1034
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,698
Huh? No more
bullshit, Kyle?

1035
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:05,501
I don't hear
you talking.

1036
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,701
[suspenseful music]

1037
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:20,516
You know what else they use
that needle for? Huh? Huh?

1038
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:23,217
Lethal injection. Yeah.

1039
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:27,090
See? It paralyzes you
but you stay conscious.

1040
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,528
Eventually,
[spits]

1041
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,896
your lungs collapse
and you die.

1042
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:33,900
[panting]
Before that happens,

1043
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:38,371
you're gonna get to watch me
slice you to little pieces.

1044
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:42,740
[both grunting]

1045
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,184

00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:12,206
[fixed phone ringing]

1049
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,446
Good evening, sir, this is
Kaylie with Guardalert Security.

1050
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,419
We have an indication there's an
alarm incident at your residence.

1051
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:29,616
I think you have the wrong number.
This is the Miller's residence.

1052
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,989
I need to speak to either Kyle,
Sarah or Avery Miller right away.

1053
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,154
Hang on a sec.

1054
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:37,289
[suspenseful music
intensifying]

1055
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,246
[shouting]

1056
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,581
Get up.

1057
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,853
Don't fuck with me.

1058
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,755
(Kyle)
Drop the gun.

1059
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,159
How about you
drop the gun? Hm?

1060
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,368
You, too, sweetie.

1061
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,001
Except that's not even a nail
gun until it's turned on.

1062
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,171
[panting]

1063
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,217
Yeah, sorry about that.
Who did you say you were looking for?

1064
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:33,311
Sin I've alerted
the local authorities.

1065
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,947
No, no, no.
Hang on. Hang on.

1066
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,787
Avery, can you
talk to this woman?

1067
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,953
It's something
about your alarm.

1068
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,327
Yeah, hi,
this is Avery.

1069
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:45,060
Hi. You having a bit of
a party there tonight?

1070
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:48,227
Yeah, um, sorry.

1071
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,566
That was Brad and he's
emotionally retarded.

1072
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,799
How can I help you?

1073
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,207
Well, your alarm went off
so I need you to provide me

1074
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:58,074
with the password
to this account.

1075
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:01,741
If for any reason you feel
like you can't speak--

1076
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,978
No, no, um, um,
it's-it's 'diamond.

1077
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,648
[suspenseful music]

1078
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,248
That's right,
isn't it?

1079
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:13,385
Yes. Yes, it is.

1080
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,496
[screams]

1081
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,729
Patrol cars have been
dispatched to your location.

1082
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:24,066
The officers will need
to verify...

1083
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,267
No. Please don't do that.
My parents have no idea I'm having this thing.

1084
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:30,038
If they find out,
um, I'm dead.

1085
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,513
I mean, this is
my first party here,

1086
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,416
and-and we're gonna clean
up and everything.

1087
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:40,511
And you have
the password, okay?

1088
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,023
Okay?

1089
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,532
Okay? Please?

1090
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,125
Sure. Sure. Okay.

1091
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:57,865
I'll let it go
this time, honey.

1092
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,703
Have a good time.

1093
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,867
Thank you.

1094
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,606
You're a smart
girl. Okay.

1095
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,285
Let's start over.

1096
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,298
[gunshot]
Oh!

1097
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,561
Oh, my God!

1098
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,766
No! Stay there, dammit!
I'm fucking sick of you yelling all the time!

1099
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,399
Shut up, Sarah!
Shut up!

1100
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,604
It's your fucking fault!
I got it. I got it, bro. Okay?

1101
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,510
Just trust me
for a fucking moment.

1102
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,605
Everyone just
shut the fuck up!

1103
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:45,483
And let me concentrate
for a minute.

1104
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,145
Avery, shut up.

1105
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:50,248
We 're just gonna
sit for a minute.

1106
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,020
[suspenseful music]

1107
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,356
You know what?
When I was a little boy,

1108
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:56,522
you know what my mom
used to say to me?

1109
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,260
I'd get these headaches.
I'd be screaming and she would say,

1110
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,462
"Elias, would you shut up?
You're taking all the air out of the room.

1111
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:05,132
Air that other people could
be doing good things with."

1112
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,106
I was never any
good at anything.

1113
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,041
I mean, I had a
few jobs, you know,

1114
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,805
nothing that
stuck, though.

1115
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:14,508
Avery, quiet, okay?
Daddy needs to concentrate.

1116
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,642
[Avery crying]

1117
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:22,554
There was one thing I was good at.
Selling dope, okay?

1118
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:23,886
When I had
the product,

1119
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,483
[pops]
everything worked.

1120
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,827
I was so good at it, man, that they
decided they were gonna front me

1121
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:33,129
$180,000 worth.

1122
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,730
When they said that, I thought,
hey, this is too much, man.

1123
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:41,673
I can't handle this.
But then I thought about it.

1124
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:44,337
I figured, fuck it, man.

1125
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:48,907
The world's been against
me my whole life.

1126
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,646
It's time I back
myself and my girl.

1127
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,155
Hey, buddy.

1128
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,691
I want you
to listen to me

1129
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,919
because I'm
telling you a story.

1130
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,323
[sighs]

1131
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,021
See? Somebody
jacked my shit.

1132
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,087
$180,000 worth.

1133
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,098
[general shouting]

1134
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,668
(Petal)
No, no, no.

1135
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,330
No. No.

1136
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,930
Hundred an eighty.
That's a whole lot of money you owe.

1137
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,873
Yeah. We're
getting it.

1138
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,434
How?

1139
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:21,209
Never mind how. Okay?
We're getting it.

1140

He has
a pretty face.

1141
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,855
It would be a shame to
cut up a face like that.

1142
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,948
And there's some
of us, you know,

1143
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,253
we can't turn around
and just say,

1144
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:35,956
"Hey, man, I'm sorry. I'd love to pay
you back but I'm bankrupt, bro."

1145
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:39,192
Which is why they sent
the big guy along.

1146
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:42,100
Because I owe his boss
a lot of money.

1147
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,365
So, guess who they're
gonna blame for that?

1148
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,203
You know, it's really bad
mojo to cut the tax man.

1149
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,710
So I'll tell
you what, man.

1150
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,803
Get me some cash.

1151
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:55,110
And then we'll get this thing seen to.
All right?

1152
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:05,549
[whispering] I'm-I'm worth
more dead than alive.

1153
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,504
Baby, look.

1154
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:31,475
I guess I'm not the only one
you've been holding out on, huh?

1155
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,453
You knew all along about my
baby brother and your wife.

Hey. No.
No, it's me, man.

1158
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:56,944
Well he-he can't come
to the phone right now.

1159
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,879
I'm getting your goddamn
money, that's what I'm...

1160
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,779
Yeah. Okay.

1161
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,945
No, I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll be there.

1162
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,852
I'll be there.

1163
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:17,960
Hey, man.

1164
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,297
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

1165

How's that leg doing? [sniffs]

1166
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,903
I'm sorry about this.

1167
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,497
Looks like you had enough
problems before we came.

1168
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,807
You know, you're not the
only one bleeding, man.

1169
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:35,316
You could have saved us
all this fucking hassle.

1170
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,181
No!

Back off.
Back off.

1175
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,858
You're a coward.
You know that?

1176

You're a fucking coward
and you're a fuck up!

What the fuck
did you expect?

1178
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:55,535
Look. Look around you.
Could this be any more fucked up?

1179
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,003
Oh, yeah.
It could be, man.

1180

Like if someone
was here,

1181

if someone was here for
something other than money.

1182

What does that mean? Huh?
What does that mean?

1183
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,535
You're not even
supposed to be here.

No, you're not coming.

Why the hell I'm not?

1186
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:12,045
You can go somewhere and get
yourself seen by a lot of people

1187
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,746
and I'll call
you afterwards.

1188
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,517
How about I save you
the trouble of calling?

1189

reasons and you know that.

I apologize, Mr. Miller.
It's officer Kelly, from Guardalert.

Oh, yeah, yeah!
That was my daughter.

She had some people
over without asking us.

We worked it out.
She is being punished.

Let me assure you.

Sorry but the police
summons was canceled.

for stopping b y.

to notify the police.

the way out here for nothing.

no diamonds,

1264
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:13,856
so we'll just have the
teenage girl go to the ATM.

1265
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,759
What, you got
a better idea?

1266
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,196
You run. You don't
come back for us.

1267
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,858
You hear me?
Don't come back for us.

1268
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,800

(Elias)
Come!

1270
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,107

Take her upstairs.

[Sarah crying]
Avery, no.

1272
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:34,548
If you see people, if
you tell them anything,

1273
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,514
I'm gonna kill
your parents.

1274
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,177
And I'm gonna do it as
punishment and then you'll know

1275
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:42,279
it wasn't me that killed your parents.
It was you. Right?

1276
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,791
Now go
Get changed.

1277
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:02,306
Honey. You rich people,
you don't smoke.

1278
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,677
Sarah, you don't
need to worry.

1279
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:09,046
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1280
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,311
I will take care
of you and Avery.

1281
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,378
Okay? The way
he never did.

1282
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:16,150

He's right.

1285

Come on, you don't
really believe--

1286
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:25,561
That you're a part of this?
That I'm a cuckold? What?

1287
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,397
That your filthy lust
invited them in? What?

What are you doing?

1297
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:24,047
You need to get your things.
You need to leave.

No.

1299

I asked you to leave.

I need you
to go. Please.

Really? Is that
what you want

01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,915
or what you just you
think you should say?

What are you
talking about?

This is good. Okay?

1312
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,452
No, this is insane.
Please leave.

1313

Be honest
with yourself.

I am honest, I...

We could be so fucking
good together.

1316

No. I'm gonna call your supervisor
if you don't get out right now.

1317
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,626
I'm gonna call him and tell
him what you're doing.

1318
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,760
You don't need to.

01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,203
Please. Come on.
You're scaring me.

Listen, you do not
have to be unhappy.

I'm not unhappy, I...

1323
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:21,338
I love my husband and I want
you to get out of my house.

1324
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,677
Okay.

1325

Get your stuff
and leave.

1326
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,783
I will go.

And she loves me.

1331
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,801
Well, good.
Because that stuff

1332
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,036
your brother was gonna
shoot her up with?

1333
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,975
They use it for executions.
Did you know that?

1334
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,880
Yeah. Yeah. That was the plan.
To execute her.

1335
01:12:55,972 --> 01:13:00,148
So if you love her, take her,
find Avery and get out of here

01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,745
before that

can do this, right?

take you to Mexico.

And we're, we're gonna get her...

01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,738
We're gonna her out of foster
care, I'm gonna marry you,

1341
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,571
and what are
you gonna do?

1342
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:24,235
You're gonna get
clean, baby.

But if it turns out that this party's
bullshit, what are you gonna do?

1345
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,685
I'm gonna kill her.

I would never...

1347
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,895
Never leave Avery, I know, which is why
you have to go with him now and get her.

And he's gonna pay 100K just
for that little privilege?

You think you're
worth that, huh?

1360

Do you think you're worth
that much more than me?

1361
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,492
You know my plan, huh?
You wanna know my plan?

1362

Stop it.
Stop it.

I'm gonna go
in there

[whining]

1423
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,268
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!

01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,504
[loud thump]

1425
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,886
(Elias)
Ah, shit.

1426
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,888
I told you that
there was cash!

1427
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,855
You fucking people.

1428

[laughing]

1429
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,701
Man, you could have saved us
all a lot of aggravation.

1430
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:29,208
You would have
ki-ki-killed us sooner.

1431
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,905
Oh, well, you know, it
all ends up the same.

1432
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:33,913
Any last words?

1433
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,375
Get out of our house.

1434
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,048
Where's Petal?

1435
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,058
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

1436
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,094
I'll kill you.

1437
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:49,060
Not before I kill
one of your parents.

1438
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:53,794
So which one 's it gonna be?
Huh ? Who ?

1439
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,733
I'll tell you what I'll
choose for ya. Mommy.

[loud thump]

1442
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,988
Oh, fuck.

1443
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:24,860
You see, Sarah,

1444
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:26,296
he didn't love you.

1445
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:29,427
He knew you'd
leave him for me.

1446
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,938
Right? He saw divorce
and decided to cash out.

1447
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,804
Why, Kyle?

1448
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,469
You were just
gonna cry poor

1449
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:39,513
and screw your
family in a settlement?

1450
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:43,947
I was saving it
for my family.

1451
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:49,649
Something the bank
c-couldn't take.

1452
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:53,785
It's the money
from the necklace.

1453
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:58,855
I hid it to get us out of this.

1454
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,991
Oh, well, thank you.

1455
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,002
Thank you,
for all of it.

1456
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,368
Sarah, do you wanna
help me with this cash?

1457
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:06,906
Huh?

1458
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,018
What? Kyle.

1459
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:21,350

01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,481

We gotta go.

1464
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,698
(Sarah)
No! Kyle!

Run, Mom, please.

01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,011

Oh!

No! No!

Get out of the way.

1482
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,541
You're gonna
have to shoot me.

1483
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,553
I would-I would never hurt you.
I love you.

1484
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,079
If you love me,
give me the gun.

1485
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,231
Help me.

1486

Give me the gun! Please.

Jonah.

1489
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,069
I knew that you would
come back for me.

1490
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:51,611
Yeah.

1491
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:53,908
Yeah. That's right.

01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,576
I love you.
Come on.

1493
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:01,985
Give it to me.
It's fine. Yeah.

1494
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,681
I'll help you.

1495
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:05,315
You're a liar!

1496
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,758
You're just trying
to protect him!

If I'm dying, you
are coming with me.
