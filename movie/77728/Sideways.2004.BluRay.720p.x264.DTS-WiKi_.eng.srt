- Yes, congratulations.

00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,305
Yes, well, uh,
it's not exactly finalized yet.

58
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,846
- So... There has been some interest, and...
- Your friend is modest.

59
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,143
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

60

- What is the subject of your book?

- Nonfiction?
- Uh, no. It's... It's a novel.

- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.

00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,159
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life...

64
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,162
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.

65
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,494
Good. I like nonfiction.

66
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,999
There is so much to know
about this world.

67
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,538
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

68
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,973
That's an interesting perspective.

69
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,442

- Oh, well, I like them both.

that I prefer the dark.

Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

76
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,035
- We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.

00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,045
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,707
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.

00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,547
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

80
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,554
Why did you tell them
that my novel was being published?

81
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,285
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

82
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,726
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,732
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors
was passing it to a senior editor.

84
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,234
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

85
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,237
No. It's a long shot.

86
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,831
Besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.

87
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,842
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

88
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,844
You know? I've stopped caring.

89
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,847
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.

90
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,112
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.

91
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,619
I think this is the one. Huh?

92
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,622
I'm really proud of you, man.

93
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,715
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?

94
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,956
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?

95
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,588
- I've been saving it. Don't...
- All right. I won't open it.

96
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,599

Despite your crass behavior...

103
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,546
I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.

104
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,554
Yeah. Me too.

105
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,557
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

106
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,651
- Was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!

107
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,662
That's 100% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.

108
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,664
They don't even make it anymore.

109
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,631
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,634
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh, Jesus.

111
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,636
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

112
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,003
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
- Just tell me.

113
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,009
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.

114
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,944
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run...

115
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,017
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation...

116
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,020
[Miles]
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

117
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,021
- [Jack] Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- And?

118
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,023
It's great.

119
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,026
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

120
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,426
Just seems... I don't know,
more congealed or something.

121
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,991
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

122
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,630
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

123
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,640
There is no new ending.

124
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,643
Page 750 on is exactly the same.

125
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,242
Well, maybe it just seemed new...

126
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,978
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

127
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,054
Yeah! That must be it!

128
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,791
Whoa. Why are we getting off?

129
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:50,794
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

130
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:53,797
- I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

131
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,799
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Okay?

132
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:59,132
- And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
- Okay.

133
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,071
- It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
- Okay.!

134
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,075
I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?

135
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,146
Uh, oh... 70-something.

136
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,651
[Groans]

137
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,252
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.

138
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,040
Thank you.

139
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,340
[Doorbell Rings]

140
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,985
- Surprise.!
- Surprise!

141
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,987
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

142
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,820
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!

143
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,327
What a surprise!

144
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,264
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

145
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,267
Happy birthday, Mom.

146
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,269
They're from both of us.
[Chuckling]

147
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:10,070
- A famous actor
bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!

148
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,737
- Don't I feel special?
- [Jack] And champagne.!

149
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,009
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!

150
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,016
Isn't that nice.

151
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,451
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...

152
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,456
marrying no less

Gosh, that was, like, 11 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

154
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,589
- Well, you were wonderful in that show.!
- [Laughs]

155
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:38,932
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

156
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,472
Oh, now, Miles...

157
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,601
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

158
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,611
Look how I'm dressed!

159
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,113
I've gotta run and put my face on.

160
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,116
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

161
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,742
Oh, stop it!

162
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,753
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- [TV: Announcer, Faint]

- Yeah, I'm hungry.

Along with the battle casualties...

165
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,694
Just a snack.

166
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,696
The Germans lost almost a million men.

167
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,165
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.

168
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,371
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

169
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,875
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.

[Chuckles]
L-Is this chicken?

171
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,880
I could have made something fancier...

172
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,883
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...

173
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,944
was coming for a visit
and bringing a certain special friend.

174
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,716
It was a surprise, Mom.

175
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,224
And I could've already put clean sheets...

176

at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

They do a magnificent job there.

- You talked to Wendy?
- Just now.

She's thrilled! And the twins...

No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.

Well, you boys do what you want.

I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.

The one where you were the jogger.

Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.

I'm gonna show you a good time.

We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf...

we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...

and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frere.

257
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,202
And get your bone smooched.

258
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,488
You know what?

259
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,185
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first. Okay?

260
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,762
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

261
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,764
These guys make top-notch pinot
and chardonnay.

262
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,266
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

263
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,270
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

264
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:57,001
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.

265
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,943
- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

266
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,948
You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

267
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,383
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

268
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,978
and it just cools down the berries.

269
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,922
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

270
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,518
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

271
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,532
[Miles]
Let me show you how this is done.

272
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,535
First thing... hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

273
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,798
You're looking for color and clarity.

274
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,306
- Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

275
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,401
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

276
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,377
- Okay?
- Okay.

277
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,380
Now tip it.

278
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:41,942
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

279
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,955
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

280
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,957
It's usually
more important with reds.

281
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,959
- Okay?
- Okay.

282
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,961
Now stick your nose in it.

283
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,463
- [Sniffs] Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

284
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,829
Really get your nose right in there.
Really...

285
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,494
Mmm. A little citrus.

286
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,631
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

287
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,469
Passion fruit. Mmm.

288
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,479
And... Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...

289
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,142
[Sniffs]
Soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and...

290
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,221
There's a... just a flutter of, like, a...

291
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,154
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

292
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,249
- Wow.
- [Sniffs]

293
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,260
Mmm!

294
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,262
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

295
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,491
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

296
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,500
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

297
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,502
Oxygenating it opens it up.

298
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,266
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

299
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,706
- Smell again.
- [Both Inhaling]

300
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,710
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of'em.

301
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,280
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.

302
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,979
Mmm! Ahh.

303
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,618
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?

304
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,387
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities...

305
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,395
but this one is pretty damn good.

306
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,365
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
- Just released two months ago.

307
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,367
- Nice job.
- We like it.

308
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,733
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

309
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,739
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

310
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,502
[Chuckles]

311
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,578
Are you chewing gum?

312
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,550
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

313
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,552
Whoa!

314
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,055
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

315
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,489
I mean, you've been there.

316
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,495
Well, you know, l... I think that you
waited for some good reason...

317
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,498
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

318
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
so I think it's great.

319
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,003
It's time.

320
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,006
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

321
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:20,010
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

322
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,013
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

323
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,017
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

324
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,021
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

325
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,023
So I'm thinking about it.

326
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,025
But I don't know.

327
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,027
Might get a little incestuous.

328
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,030
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

329
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,532
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

330
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,364
This would just provide some stability.

331
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,099
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

332
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,108
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

333
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,110
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

334
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,839
No. No.

335
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,987
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.

336
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,989
- Miles!
- Sir.

337
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,491
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

338
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,494
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

339
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,497
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.

340
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,999
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

341
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,003
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

342
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,006
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

343
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,008
[Laughs]
Absolument.

344
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,011
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

345
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,081
Very special. Thank you.

346
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,086
Mmm!

347
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,679
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

348
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:44,627
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

349
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:47,095
Pour us a couple, will ya.

350
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,292
Yeah. It's tight.

351
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,903
There you are, gentlemen.

352
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,974
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

353
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,643
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

354
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:03,646
It's gonna be great.

355
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,716
Here's to us.

356
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,157
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

357
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,659
Check out that chick.

358
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,355
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

359
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,365
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

360
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:26,062
- You know that chick?
- Yes. Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

361
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,366
You know?
It's practically my office.

362
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,374
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

363
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,378
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year, year and a half.

364
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,380
She's incredibly hot.

365
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,746
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

366
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,751
Check out the rock.

367
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,753
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

368
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,755
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

369
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,587
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

370
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,594
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

371
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:56,599
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

372
00:23:56,701 --> 00:24:00,034
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

373
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,039
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

374
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,235
Calm down. Let's just eat.

375
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,576
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

376
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,584
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

377
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,314
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

378
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,016
Uh... no, actually.

379
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,923
But... thank you.
[Chuckles]

380
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,496
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

381
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,497
You guys been out tasting?

382
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,760
Oh, you know it. You know it.

383
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,961
Oh, this is my friend, Jack. Jack, Maya.

384
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,970
- Hiya.
- Hi.

385
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,666
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

386
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,266
Oh. Back to work.

387
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,347
- Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

388
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,349
And she's obviously into you.

389
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,351
What else do you know about her?

390
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,580
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

391
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,625
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

392
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,627
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

393
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,197
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton, Jack.

394
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,198
How is that ever gonna work out?

395
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,598
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

396
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:08,434
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

397
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,141
You're blind, dude. Blind.

398
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:16,202
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

399
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,318
Hey, Gary.

400
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,320
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

401
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,322
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

402
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,324
Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

403
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,326
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

404
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,794
Please. Light up, light up.

405
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,398
In fact, would you like to join us?

406
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,966
Sure.

407
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,811
- [Clears Throat]
- So, how's that book coming, Miles?

408
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:51,814
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

409
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:56,250
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

410
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,254
It's getting published.

411
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,655
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

412
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,251
Well, congratulations.

413
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,262
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

414
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,332
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

415
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,434
Are you a writer too?

416
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,436
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

417
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,938
Really. What kind of stuff?

418
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,941
Mmm, a lot of TV.

419
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,444
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

420
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:26,108
But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

421
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,117
Anything I might know?

422
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,779
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

423
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,189
Now with a low, low
5.8% A.P.R. Financing!

424
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,193
[Laughing]
That's hilarious!

425
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,196
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

426
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,198
- You are not.
- He is.

427
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,461
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

428
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,469
Side effects may include oily discharge...

429
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,471
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.

430
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,633
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble...

431
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,643
you're dead, asshole!

432
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,645
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

433
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,874
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

434
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,148
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

435
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:06,280
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

436
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,327
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

437
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,453
- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

438
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,464
Uh, the Windmill.

439
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,534
Windmill.

440
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,469
The girl is looking to party...

441
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,472
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

442
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,474
- Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired, Jack.

443
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,976
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

444
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,978
She lit up like a pinball machine...

445
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,480
when she found out
your novel was getting published.

446
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,983
Now I have another lie to live down.

447
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,986
- Thanks, Jack.
- Just trying to get you a little action.

448
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,488
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

449
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,992
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

450
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,494
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

451
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,498
And, by the way, I was right...
she's not married.

452
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,659
- How do you know?
- No rock.

453
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,398
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

454
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,708
Oh.

455
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,526
[Sighs]

456
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,323
What's the plan for today, Miles?

457
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,330
Aha.

458
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:24,026
Good. Um, we head up north...

459
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,035
Begin the grape tour up there...

460
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,037
work our way south...

461
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,039
so that the more we drink...

462
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,200
the closer we get to the motel.

463
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,539
What's your problem?

464
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,256
What is it?

465
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,427
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles...

466
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,430
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...

467
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:59,162
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.

468
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,101
[Chuckles]
Oh.

469
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,232
Well, now the cards are on the table.

470
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,242
Yes, they are.

471
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:09,836
- Ah.
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.

472
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:14,612
I am going to get laid before I get married
on Saturday. Do you read me?

473
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,020
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

474
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:20,022
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.

475
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,354
It's, uh, your party, evidently.

476
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,360
Why don't you just, uh...

477
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:28,364
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

478
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,366
No, Miles!

479
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,936
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

480
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,937
We should both be cutting loose.

481
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,873
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

482
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,677
It's something we should share.

483
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:18,208
[Man]
This is our Syrah.

484
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,284
Okay.

485
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,684
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

486
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,619
That's a big one.

487
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,168
[Woman] But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

488
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,670
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

489
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,300
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

490
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,243
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

491
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,874
Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

492
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,502
[Woman]
This is our estate chardonnay.

493
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,703
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

494
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,713
Stephanie.

495
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,783
Stephanie. Nice.

496
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:29,518
So, what do you think?

497
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,520
Mmm. Quaffable.

498
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,852
But, uh, far from transcendent.

499
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,858
I like it. Tastes great.

500
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,860
Oak-y.

501
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,827
This is a cabernet franc.

502
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,832
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

503
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,494
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

504
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,503
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

505
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,506
and it was a silver medal winner...

506
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,508
at Paso Robles last year.

507
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,170
Hmm.

508
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,213
Mmm.

509
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,215
Well, I will tell you something.

510
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,650
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

511
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,655
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe...

512
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,157
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.

513
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,625
So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

514
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,289
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

515
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
We're just over in Buellton.

516
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,801

517
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,803
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

518
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,806
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

519
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,809
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

520
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,436
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

521
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,447
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

522
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,449
Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?

523
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,519
Sure.

524
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,451
This is our estate Syrah.

525
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,491
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

526
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,565
I know. I need to be spanked.

527
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,802
Excuse me.

528
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,140
The Syrah?

529
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,980
Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.

530
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,986
- You have the keys.
- I do?

531
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,988
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

532
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,990
- So, we're on.
- What?

533
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:18,153
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.

534
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,162
- Wi... With Maya?
- Yeah.

535
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,664
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.

536
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,667
This chick Stephanie?

537
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,670
She's got it all goin' on.

538
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,672
Well, she is cute, yeah.

539
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,674
Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.

540
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,610
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?
What's the matter with you?

541
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,525
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

542
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,721
Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

543
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,865
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

544
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,299
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

545
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:01,860
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

546
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:06,706
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

547
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,645
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

548
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,450
- Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.
- [Sighs]

549
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,680
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

550
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:21,189
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

551
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,852
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

552
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,862
She got remarried.

553
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,932
She what?

554
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,535
When?

555
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,162
About a month ago.

556
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,173
Maybe six weeks.

557
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:41,075
To that guy...
that guy with the restaurant?

558
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,387

560
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,827
I'd like to go home now.

561
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,829
Miles, get out of the car.

562
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,365
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

What do you think?

566
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,075
Why didn't you tell me
about this before, Jack?

567
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,977
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

568
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,982
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,259
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.

620
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,262
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

621
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,492
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

622
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,398
Yeah. I miss you too.

623
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,472
Yeah. I love you too.

624
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,369
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

625
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,378
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

626
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,380
People love that guy.

627
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,383
And don't forget...
your novel is coming out in the fall.

628
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,386
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

629
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,456
Come here, Miles. Come here.

630
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,961
Do not sabotage me.

631
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,964
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

632
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,967
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

633
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,970
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

634
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,473
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

635
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,976
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

636
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,978
Jesus. No merlot.

637
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,207
Did you bring your Xanax?

638
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,784
- [Pills Rattle]
- All right.

639
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,786
Come here.

640
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,448
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

641
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,458
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

642
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,358
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

643
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,368
Hi. Just looking for some friends.

644

- [Murmuring, Chattering]

645
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,848
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

646
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,850
- Hi, Miles.
- [Stephanie] Good. How are you?

647
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,353
Hello, Maya.
[Sighs]

648
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,357
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- [Maya] Thank you.

649
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,053
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

650
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,061
[Jack]
So, what's good here?

651
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:36,394
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

652
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,469
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

653
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,471
- What time did you close up at Ka... Is it...
- Kalyra.

654
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,634
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.

655
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,645
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were...

656
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,147
- That's nice.
- It's aged 12 months in oak.

657
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,149
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

658
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,151
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

659
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,416
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

660
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,651
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

661
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,958
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

662
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,055
- Right.
- Just... small stuff.

663
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,066
Uh, hints of clove.

664
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,068
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

665
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,400
Yeah. Mmm.

666
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,406
Sorry. It's good.

667
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,772
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

668
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,777
Good. [Chuckles] Okay.

669
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,779
[Stephanie]
Oh, that's... that...

670
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,611
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

671
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,617
I didn't hear him say that.

672
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,122
- Whenever I say something he said...
- [Laughs] Very good.

673
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:35,623
No, actually... No. That one.
N-Not this one...

674

[Jack, Stephanie Laughing]

675
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,026
[Jack]
I'm having that too.

676
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,326
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

677
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,026
That's what I'm saying.

678
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,035
For our soup we have corn chowder...

679
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:50,538
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

680
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,701
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

681
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,711
And finally...

682
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,714
- [Maya] I have to explain my credentials.
- [Stephanie] Yes.!

683
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,148
Miles, what does this remind you of?

684
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:04,152
"Red wine. Red wine."

685
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:07,553
[Jack]
He was brought up on a lot of charges.

686
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,526
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

687
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,529
Right.

688
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,532
After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

689
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,534
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

690
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,228
Wow, Miles.!

691
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,464
- Ohh.!
- [Maya] Well, in that case...

[Conversations Continue,
Faint, Indistinct]

693
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:35,946
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

694
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,022
[Maya, Stephanie Laughing]

695
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,190
[Miles]
Ancient way of treating the grape.

696
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,386
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

697
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:49,762
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

698
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,495
[Stephanie]
So everyone's going back to that.

699
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,914
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

700
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,917
- It's not a... It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.

701
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,919
Your lips look soft.

00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,924
- The whole area is...
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

704
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,995
- What do they call the...
- [Phone: Line Continues Ringing]

705
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,602
Malibu... It's Malibu Canyon.

Miles?

Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?

What... Uh... What's on your mind?

Oh, nothin'. L...
[Chuckles]

720
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,988
Just heard that you got remarried.

Congratulations. I, uh...

722

Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.

Oh, Miles, you're drunk.

724
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:35,303
Oh, just a little local pinot,
you know.

725
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:39,307
A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.
[Laughs, Clears Throat]

- Where are you?
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.

New owners. Cozy ambience, uh...

728
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:49,113
Excellent food too.
You should, uh... You should try it.

729
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:53,519
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.

Hello?

731

- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's...

732
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,496
All right, I just...
I wanted to let you know...

733
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,501
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

734
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:12,166
so just in case you were dreading some sort of,
you know, run-in or something like that...

735
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,176
well, you worry no more...

736
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,178
because I'm not gonna be there.

737
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,807
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

738
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,215
What is his name?

739
00:45:23,453 --> 00:45:25,353
Ken.

Ken.

742
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,359
I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.

743
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:34,794
No... You know, it's just...
l-l-I heard about this...

744
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,560
for the first time, uh, today.

745
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,568
Uh, your getting remarried, that is.

746
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,073
And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.

747
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,234
Just... hard to believe.

[Chuckles]

749
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,283
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...

750
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,283
for us somewhere down the road.

751

And I just, uh...

- Miles.
- Huh?

753
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,791
Maybe it is better
if you don't come to the wedding.

754
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,463
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.

00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,533
You're the boss.

Huh? I don't know.

Yeah. Don't take too long.

- Okay. Bye, girls. [Chuckles]

What is up with you?

- Yeah...

- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

Hmm?

- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

775
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,793
Victoria is gone. Gone.

Poof! In the wind.

777

I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.

Maya... Fuckin' Maya... She's great!

She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.

Huh?

00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,809
And what was that 10-minute lecture
on, what, Vouvrays?

Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

785
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,020
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

786
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,024
Have you forgotten all the bad times
you had with Victoria...

787
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,651
how small she could make you feel?

788
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,663
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?

789

Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.

Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?

Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.

why don't we go back to my place?

Holy mackerel.

Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.

832
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,209

What's my... Oh, brother.

00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:01,275
Well, it's, uh...
it's difficult to summarize.

00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,278
Um...

892
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,281
it starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...

893
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,648
about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.

894
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,984
- Oh.
- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.

But only... only loosely.

896

What's the title?

897
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,993
The Day After Yesterday.

Oh. You mean today.

899
00:53:23,566 --> 00:53:27,127
Um... uh, yeah.
I mean, r-right. But it's more...

900
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,866
So it's about, like,
death and mortality, or...

901

[Sighs]
Uh, yeah...

904
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,481
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

905
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:44,485
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.

906

And, uh, a lot of other things happen...

It's kind of a mess.

And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves...

909
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,996
or devolves...

910
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,396
into this sort of
Robbe-Grillet mystery.

just to write it, even.

Yeah.

I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday...

918

and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.

- Mmm.

00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,924
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.

924

and thrive even when it's neglected.

957

No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?

958
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:30,517
And, in fact, it can only grow...

in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.

Oh, l... I think l...

978
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:40,154
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.

979
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:44,124
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

980
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,127
- You know?
- Right.

981
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,960
- But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.

982
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,966
And the more I drank...

983
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:55,003
the more I liked
what it made me think about.

Like what?

985

Wow.

987
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,904
No, I mean, I like to think
about the life of wine.

988
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,914
Yeah.

989
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,984
How it's a living thing.

990
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,620
I like to think about...

991
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:16,123
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing...

992
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:18,557
how the sun was shining...

993
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,629
if it rained.

994
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,731
I like to think about...

995
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,200
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...

996
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:31,763
and, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.

997
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:37,508
I like how wine continues to evolve.

998
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,515
Like,
if I opened a bottle of wine today...

999
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:44,644
it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

1000
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:49,157
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

1001
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:54,218
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

1002
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,325
That is, until it peaks...

1003
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,334
like your '61.

1004
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,902
And then it begins its steady...

1005
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,909
inevitable decline.

1006
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,536
Hmm.

1007
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,776

She said she had a fun time too.

Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

1117
01:08:48,052 --> 01:08:50,020
God, it was so awesome.

1118
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:53,420
I think I'm really starting to get
a handle on the whole process.

The selection to the harvest.

1121
01:08:58,496 --> 01:09:01,465
Then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it?

1122
01:09:01,566 --> 01:09:03,864
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1123
01:09:03,968 --> 01:09:06,630
Then we ate pinot grapes
right off the vine.

1124
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:08,796
They were a little sour...

- With this chick.

What?

1133
01:09:33,397 --> 01:09:35,627
Does she know about Saturday?

Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

I haven't told her I'm available.

is only for a few days.

Oh, you've been thinking. And?

Might have to put
the wedding on hold, is all.

1143

Look, I know that
that could be tricky...

- for certain people to accept at first.

All right?
But life is short, Miles.

1146

I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

You know what?
That's not just for my sake.

for Christine's feelings too.

I mean, being with Stephanie
has completely opened my eyes.

She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:36,418
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

- She fucks different.
- Okay.

I gotta tell you, man.

from you, but I'm not gonna get that.

I'll handle the business side.

a little premature?

Hmm? All right. You know,

Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in.

Just get it out there.

But you know what?

- I love you too. I'll call you back.

1389
01:29:16,713 --> 01:29:20,945
[Miles] This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1390
01:29:21,051 --> 01:29:24,282
I just want to go home.

1391
01:29:25,655 --> 01:29:27,724
I know what you need.

1392

I know what you need.

1393
01:29:28,525 --> 01:29:30,993
[Jack] How 'bout this one?
We didn't hit this one.

1394
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:33,654
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

1395
01:29:33,763 --> 01:29:38,063
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1397

[Miles] It tastes like the back
of a fucking L.A. School bus.

1398
01:30:15,738 --> 01:30:18,172
Now, they probably didn't de-stem...

1399
01:30:18,274 --> 01:30:20,742
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

1400
01:30:20,844 --> 01:30:23,142
Crushed it up with leaves and mice...

1401
01:30:23,246 --> 01:30:27,046
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1402
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,118
Fuckin' Raid.

1403
01:30:30,653 --> 01:30:32,644
Tastes pretty good to me.

01:30:32,755 --> 01:30:35,883
Hmm. Look.
They have a reserve pinot.

- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

1417
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,428
- It's very nice.
- Right.

1418
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:16,192
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

Well, actually, there is word.

01:31:18,401 --> 01:31:20,869
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman
this morning.

1421
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:22,870
Right. And?

1422
01:31:22,972 --> 01:31:25,497
And... they're passing.

1423
01:31:27,177 --> 01:31:31,511
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.

1424
01:31:31,614 --> 01:31:35,675
They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.

1425
01:31:35,785 --> 01:31:38,845
He said it was a really tough call.

1426
01:31:40,423 --> 01:31:42,323
Oh. Right.

1427

- I'm sorry, Miles.
- [Sighs]

So I don't know where that leaves us.

I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.

1430
01:31:52,135 --> 01:31:56,231
I think it's one of those unfortunate cases

The whole industry's gotten gutless.

It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.

It's only about the marketing.

a, uh, pour down here, please?
- Sure.
