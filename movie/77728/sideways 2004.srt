malolactic fermentation.

You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

266
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:10,838
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

267
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,432
and it just cools down the berries.

268
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:16,374
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

[ Miles ]
Let me show you how this is done.

271
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:27,983
First thing-- hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

272
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,245
You're looking for color and clarity.

00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:32,751
-Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

274
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,845
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

275
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,821
- Okay?
- Okay.

276
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:39,823
Now tip it.

277
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:44,383
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

278
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:47,394
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

279
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:49,396
It's usually
more important with reds.

280
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,397
- Okay?
- Okay.

281
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:53,398
Now stick your nose in it.

282
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,899
- [ Sniffs ] Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

283
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,265
Really get your nose right in there.
Really--

284
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,928
Mmm. A little citrus.

285
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,064

00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:11,908

like, the faintest...

288
00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:15,570
[ Sniffs ]
soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--

289
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,647
There's a--just a flutter of, like, a--

290

like, a nutty Edam cheese.

- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

294
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,913
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

295
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,920
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

296
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:34,922
Oxygenating it opens it up.

297
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:37,684
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,774
- Nice job.
- We like it.

307
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,139
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

308
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:12,143
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

309

[ Chuckles ]

310
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,981
Are you chewing gum?

311
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:55,935
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

312
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:57,937
Whoa!

313
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,438
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

314
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,872
I mean, you've been there.

315
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:07,876
Well, you know, I-- I think that you
waited for some good reason...

316
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:10,877
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

317
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,378
so I think it's great.

318
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,381
It's time.

319
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,382
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

320
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,385
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

321
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,386
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

322
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:29,389
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

323
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:33,391
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

324
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,392
So I'm thinking about it.

325
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,393
But I don't know.

326
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,395
Might get a little incestuous.

327
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:42,396
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

328
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,896
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

329
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,727
This would just provide some stability.

330
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:51,461
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

331
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,469
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

332
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,470
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

333
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,198
No. No.

334
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:06,343
- Hey, hey, hey.!
- Hey.

335
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:08,344
- Miles!
- Sir.

336
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:10,844
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

337
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:13,846
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

338
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:16,848
This is my buddyJack.
He's getting married next week.

339
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:19,349
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

340
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:22,352
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:25,354
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

342

[ Laughs ]
Absolument.

343
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:30,356
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

344
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:32,426
Very special. Thank you.

345
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:37,429
Mmm!

346
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:41,021
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

347
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,966
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

348
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:49,433
Pour us a couple, will ya.

349
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,629
Yeah. It's tight.

350
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,238
There you are, gentlemen.

351
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,307
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

352
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:03,974
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

353
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,977
It's gonna be great.

354
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,046
Here's to us.

355
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:16,484
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

356
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,984
Check out that chick.

357
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,679
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

358
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,688
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

359
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,383
- You know that chick?
- Yes.Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

360
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:30,687
You know?
It's practically my office.

361
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,693
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

362
00:23:33,796 --> 00:23:37,696
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year,year and a half.

363
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:39,697
She's incredibly hot.

364
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,062
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

365

Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

367
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,068
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

368
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,898
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

369
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:53,904
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

370
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:58,907
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

371
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,341
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

372
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:05,344
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

373
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:08,539
Calm down. Let's just eat.

374
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:13,878
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

375
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,885
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

376
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,613
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

377
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:23,314
Uh... no, actually.

378
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:25,221
But... thank you.

-Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

And she's obviously into you.

388
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,638
What else do you know about her?

389
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,866
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

390
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,909
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

391

- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

392
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,478
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton,Jack.

393
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,479
How is that ever gonna work out?

394
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,878
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

395
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:10,712
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

396
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,418
You're blind, dude. Blind.

397
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,477
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

402
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,595
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

403
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,062
Please. Light up, light up.

404
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:40,663

- So, how's that book coming, Miles?

407
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,074
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

408
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,508
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

409
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,511
It's getting published.

410
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:03,911
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

411
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:06,505
Well, congratulations.

- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

- Cheers.
- Thanks.

Are you a writer too?

415
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,687
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:18,187
Really. What kind of stuff?

417
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,190
Mmm, a lot ofTV.

418
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,691
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

Anything I might know?

421
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,022
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

So, what are you guys up to tonight?

00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:03,379
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

434
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:08,508
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

435
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,553
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

Uh, the Windmill.

Windmill.

The girl is looking to party...

00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:24,693
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

-Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired,Jack.

- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

when she found out
your novel was getting published.

- Thanks,Jack.
-Just trying to get you a little action.

I would appreciate a little bit of help.

448
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:45,205
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

449

Well, somebody had to do the talking.

And, by the way, I was right--
she's not married.

- No rock.

the closer we get to the motel.

on this trip, Miles...

- Yeah? Like that?

485

That's a big one.

486
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:40,307
[ Woman ] But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

487
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:43,808
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

488
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:47,436
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

489
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:50,378
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

491

[ Woman ]
This is our estate chardonnay.

492
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:23,824
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

So, what do you think?

496
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:33,637
Mmm. Quaffable.

497
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:35,968
But, uh, far from transcendent.

498

Oak-y.

500
00:31:40,077 --> 00:31:41,941
This is a cabernet franc.

501
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,944
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

502
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:47,605
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

503
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:49,613
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

504
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:52,615
and it was a silver medal winner...

505
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,616
at Paso Robles last year.

506
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:57,276

Well, I will tell you something.

509
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:04,754
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

510
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:07,757
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--

511

Tastes pretty good to me.

So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

513
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:16,388
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

514
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:18,896

Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

518
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,902
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

519
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:31,528
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

520
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,539
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

521
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,540

- I do?

tonight. So we're all going out.

What's the matter with you?

- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

542
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:57,921
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

543
00:33:58,023 --> 00:34:00,354
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

544

With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

545

Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

546
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:12,695
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

Why didn't you tell me
about this before,Jack?

566
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:18,999
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:55,192
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

620
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:58,421
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

621
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,326
Yeah. I miss you too.

622
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:04,399
Yeah. I love you too.

623
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:08,294
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

624
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:11,302
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

625
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:13,303
People love that guy.

626
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:16,305
And don't forget--
your novel is coming out in the fall.

Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

628

Come here, Miles. Come here.

Do not sabotage me.

If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:33,881
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

632
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:36,883
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

633
00:39:36,986 --> 00:39:40,385
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

634
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:42,886
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

640
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:58,362
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

641
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:01,261
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

645
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:23,744
- Hi, Miles.
- [ Stephanie ] Good. How are you?

646
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:27,245
Hello, Maya.
[ Sighs ]

00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:30,247
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- [ Maya ] Thank you.

00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,942
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

So, what's good here?

650
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:38,281
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

651
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:41,355
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

652

- What time did you close up at Ka-- Is it--
- Kalyra.

around 5:30, 6:00.

- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were--

- That's nice.
- It's aged 1 2 months in oak.

00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,029
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

657
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:58,030
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

658
00:40:58,132 --> 00:41:01,293
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

659
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:04,527
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

660
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:08,833
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:10,929
- Right.
-Just... small stuff.

Yeah. Mmm.

Sorry. It's good.

- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

670
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:30,483
I didn't hear him say that.

671
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:34,986
- Whenever I say something he said--
- [ Laughs ] Very good.

672
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:37,485
No, actually-- No. That one.

- Right?
- Oh, yes.

That's what I'm saying.

677
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:48,893
For our soup we have corn chowder...

678
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:52,394
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

"Red wine. Red wine."

He was brought up on a lot of charges.

- Yeah?

00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:15,376
Right.

687

After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

Ancient way of treating the grape.

695
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:47,219
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

696
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:51,593
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

697
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:54,325
[ Stephanie ]
So everyone's going back to that.

698
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,738
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

and gaining complexity.
