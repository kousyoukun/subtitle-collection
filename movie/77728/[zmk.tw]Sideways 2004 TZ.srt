- Uh, yeah?- Miles, can you move your car, please?

00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:57,815
-为什么？-因为修屋顶工人的卡车要进来。
- Why?- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

-你车停的不太对。好么？-好。行。
- You didn't park too good. Okay?- Yeah. All right.

[ Clears Throat ]Sorry.

哦，靠！
Oh, fuck me!

13
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:04,710
我知道我说过会在中午前到那儿
I know I saidI would be there by noon...

14
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:08,617
但是我的楼在翻修有一大堆的事
but, uh, there's all of this workgoing on at my building...

15
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:11,121
简直就是场噩梦
and it's just a total nightmare.

我有些事今天早上必须处理

不过，我已经上路了。

谢谢。
Thank you.

24
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,293
- 啊！- 嗯，你好。
- Ah!- Well, hello!

25
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,625
- 你好，Erganian夫人。最近好么？- 进来吧。
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?- Come on in.

26
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:01,632
- 谢谢。Jack还在这里么？- 是的。
- Thank you. Is Jack still here?- Yes.

27
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,043
看看猫给拽的。
[ Mrs. Erganian ]Look what the cat dragged.

28
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:16,046
- 嗨，大家好。抱歉啊。- 嗨。
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.- Hey.

某人终于来了。

你终于到了。飞毛腿先生。
You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.

- 哦，记不记得我的孩子们？Alex, Helen?- 嗨，你们好。
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?- Hi. How are you?

32
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:26,556
我们还在想你是不是走错了路，跑到墨西哥的提哇纳去了...
We were thinking maybe you wentthe wrong way,you went to Tijuana...

33
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,559
- 对。- 然后他们不放你回来。
- Right.- and they don't let you back.

34
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,561
- 是啊，是啊！- 爸爸！
- Yes! Yes!- [ Laughing ] Daddy!

35
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:33,564
- 我不得不行贿他们。- 嗨，Miles。
- I had to bribe them.- [ Continues Laughing ] Hey, Miles.

36
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,566
嗨，你好，Christine。
Hey. How are you, Christine?

37
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,568
高速公路塞的让人难以置信。
- [ Kiss ]- Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.

38
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,571
真是难以置信，一路上车挤车的。
Unbelievable.It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.

39
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:43,574
我想大家周末出门都比较早。
People getting an early starton the weekend, I guess.

40
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,576
所以我就晚点出来，可还是--
Granted, I got a late start, but--

41
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:48,078
好了，我们都很高兴你能来。
Well, we're just glad you made it.

42
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,580
Christine, 你为什么不问问Miles关于蛋糕的事？
Christine, why don't youask Miles about the cake?

43
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:52,583
- 好主意。跟我来。- 怎么回事？
- Oh, good idea. Come with me.- What's this?

44
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,586
我们可能没时间了，我们马上得出发了
We don't really have time for that,'cause we gotta hit the road.

45
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:58,851
- 哦，来吧。就一秒钟的事。- 就是。
- [ Christine ] Oh, come on.!It's just gonna take a second.!- Yeah.

46
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,426
嗯。
[ Miles ]Mmm.

47
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,688
Jack告诉我们说你正在出版一本书。祝贺你。
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.Congratulations.

48
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:06,697
-呃---是啊，祝贺你。
- Uh--- Yes, congratulations.

49
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:10,565
是的，不过，呃确切的说还没有敲定呢。
Yes, well, uh,it's not exactly finalized yet.

50
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,106
- 就是有人表示感兴趣，而且--- 你的朋友很谦虚
- So-- There has been some interest, and--- Your friend is modest.

51
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:17,403
得了 来吧，Miles.别那么谦虚了，满足一下他们吧。
Oh, come on, Miles.Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

52
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,707
- 别让我当个撒谎的人啊。- 你的书是关于什么主题的？
- Don't make me out to be a liar.- What is the subject of your book?

53
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:23,077
- 纪实的？- 呃，不，是--是小说。
- Nonfiction?- Uh, no. It's-- It's a novel.

54
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:25,412
- 虚构的。对。- 哦。
- Fiction. Yes.- Oh.

55
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:28,419
不过有很多部分取材于我自己的生活...
Although there is quite a bitfrom my own life...

56
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:31,422
所以我想，从技术上讲，算部分纪实吧。
so I suppose that, technically,some of it is nonfiction.

57
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,754
好，我喜欢纪实的。
Good. I like nonfiction.

58
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,259
这个世界有太多我们需要了解的。
There is so much to knowabout this world.

59
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:39,798
我觉得读那些别人编造出来的东西简直是浪费时间。
I think you read something somebodyjust invented it, waste of time.

60
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,233
这个观点很有意思。
That's an interesting perspective.

61
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:46,702
- 那，你比较喜欢哪一个？- 呃，两个都喜欢。
- So, which one do you like better?- Oh, well, I like them both.

62
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:50,242
不过，呒，如果非要选的话，我得说我更喜欢那个黑的。
But, um, if pressed, I would have to saythat I prefer the dark.

63
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:52,742
给你说过了！
- [ Murmuring ]- [Jack ] Told ya.!

64
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:55,039
-再见。-再见。
- Bye-bye.- Bye.

65
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,122
-再见。-再见。
- Bye.- Bye.

66
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,062
再见。
Bye.

67
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,065
你他妈的刚才在哪儿？嗯？我在那儿都快死了。
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?I was dying in there.

68
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,295
-本来我们现在都应该在100英里开外了。-交通堵塞，我也没办法。
- We're supposed to bea hundred miles away by now.- I can't help the traffic.

69
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:21,305
哦，得了吧，你他妈的酒鬼。你自己明白。
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.You know you are.

70
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:23,967
好吧，我昨天晚上是尝了一点，没错。
Okay, there wasa tasting last night, yes.

71
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:27,807
我不过是想给我们的车旅准备点好东西。看那个盒子。
But I wanted to get us something nicefor the ride up. Check out the box.

72
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:30,814
你干吗告诉他们我的小说已经在出版了？
Why did you tell themthat my novel was being published?

73
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,545
-因为你说过你都联系好了。-没有，我没说过，没有。
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.- No, I didn't. No. No.

74
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:37,986
我说的是"迷题"出版社的人表示有兴趣。
What I said was that there wassome interest at Conundrum.

75
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,992
-对。"迷题"。-那个编辑要把小说递给高层编辑。
- Yeah. Conundrum.- And that one of the editorswas passing it to a senior editor.

76
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:44,494
我觉得听上去不错。听上去你已经搞定了。
Sounds pretty good to me.Sounds like you're in.

77
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:46,497
没有，希望并不大。
No. It's a long shot.

78
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:50,091
再说，"迷题"只是一家小的专业出版社。
Besides, Conundrum,it's just a small specialty press.

79
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,102
我不打算抱太大希望。
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

80
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,104
你知道，我已经不再关心这事了。
You know? I've stopped caring.

81
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,107
算了吧。我已经不再关心了。
The hell with it.I have stopped caring.

82
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,372
听起来好像这次能成。我是说，我能感觉到。
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.I mean, I can feel it.

83
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,879
我想就是这次了。嗯？
I think this is the one. Huh?

84
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,882
我真为你感到骄傲，伙计。
I'm really proud of you, man.

85
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:06,975
-现在别打开。还热着呢。-为什么不行？
- Don't open that now. It's warm.- Why not?

86
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:11,216
Jack, 这可是1992年的Byron酒。这可是非常稀罕的。懂么？
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.It's really rare. Okay?

87
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,848
-我一直存着它。别打---好的，我不打。
- I've been saving it. Don't--- All right. I won't open it.

88
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,859
-Jack!
- [ Cork Pops ]-Jack!

89
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:18,054
浪费了一半。
- [ Chuckling ]- Half of it gone.

90
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:21,565
嗨，闭嘴行不行！
Hey, shut up. Okay?

91
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,568
祝我们度过愉快地一周！
Here's to a great week.

92
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,638
来吧。
- Come on.- [ Champagne Pouring ]

93
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:30,502
嗯，绝对。
Yes. Absolutely.

94
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:32,509
虽然你很蠢...
Despite your crass behavior...

95
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:34,806
我还是很高兴我们这次能一起来
I'm actually gladwe're getting this time together.

96
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,814
对。我也这样想。
Yeah. Me too.

97
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,817
我期待这一天已经很久了。
I've been looking forward to thisfor a long time.

98
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,911
-我还以为这一天永远也不会来呢。-哎呀，味道真不错！
- Was beginning to thinkit was never gonna happen.- Man! That's tasty!

99
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,922
百分之百加州黑皮诺(pinot noir)葡萄单一品种的葡萄园。
That's 1 00% pinot noir.Single vineyard.

100
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,924
他们现在都不造这种酒了。
They don't even make it anymore.

101
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,891
-黑皮诺葡萄？-嗯。
- Pinot noir?- Mm-hmm.

102
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:50,894
-那怎么这是白色的？-哦，上帝啊。
- Then how come it's white?- Oh,Jesus.

103
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:52,896
可别在葡萄酒园问这样的问题。
Don't ask questions like thatup in wine country.

104
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:56,263
-他们会以为你是弱智呢。-告诉我么。
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.-Just tell me.

105
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,269
红葡萄酒的颜色来自葡萄皮。
Color in red winescomes from the skins.

106
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:02,204
这个酒的葡萄汁不一样，是自然流出的,不是挤压的...
This juice, on the other hand,is free run...

107
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:05,277
所以在发酵的时候不会接触到葡萄皮--
so that there's no skin contactduring fermentation--

108
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,280
对了，你有没有看过我最近的草稿？
[ Miles ]Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

109
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,281
-嗯，看过了，看过了。-觉得怎样？
- [Jack ] Oh,yeah.yeah.- And?

110
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,283
非常棒。
It's great.

111
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:16,286
我是说，有很多出改动。结构更加紧凑了。
I mean, there are so many improvements.It's much tighter.

112
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:18,686
就是看上去--不知道，好像更凝固了似的。
Just seems-- I don't know,more congealed or something.

113
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:23,251
呒。新的结局怎么样？你喜不喜欢？
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?Did you like that?

114
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:27,890
哦，对，新结局比老的那个结局好太多了。
Oh, yeah. New endingvastly superior to the old ending.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,900
就根本没有新结局。
There is no new ending.

116
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,903
从750页以后就没有改动。
Page 7 50 on is exactly the same.

117
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:37,502
噢，那大概是看着象新的吧...
Well, maybe it just seemed new...

118
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,238
难道是因为所有导致结局的情节都变了？
because everything leading up to itwas so different?

119
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,314
对！肯定是这个原因！
Yeah! That must be it!

120
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,051
哇。我们为什么要下车？
Whoa. Why are we getting off?

121
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,054
-呃，我想停一下。-干什么？
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.- For what?

122
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,057
-我想我们可以去和我妈妈打个招呼。-你妈妈？

250
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:50,526
是圣巴巴拉一带最好的产酒地之一。
One of the best producersin Santa Barbara County.

251
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:53,530
-我还以为你讨厌夏多利酒呢。-不，不不，我喜欢所有单品葡萄酒。
- I thought you hated chardonnay.- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

252
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:57,261
我只是不怎么喜欢加利福尼亚处理夏多利酒的方式。
I just don't generally like the waythey manipulate chardonnay in California.

253
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,203
-用太多橡木和苹果酸发酵。-哈。
- Too much oak and secondarymalolactic fermentation.- Huh.

254
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:05,208
你看，这个地区很适合皮诺葡萄的原因...
You see, the reason that this regionis so good for pinot...

255
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,643
是晚间从太平洋来的冷空气...
is that the cold air off the Pacificflows in at night...

256
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:11,238
让浆果类植物凉快下去。
and it just cools down the berries.

257
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,182
皮诺是一种皮很薄的葡萄。
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

258
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:17,778
不喜欢持久高温和潮湿。非常娇贵。
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.Very delicate.

259
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,792
我演示给你看该怎么做。
[ Miles ]Let me show you how this is done.

260
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,795
首先--举起杯子对着灯光仔细看葡萄酒。
First thing-- hold the glass up andexamine the wine against the light.

261
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,058
你要看的是颜色和纯净度。
You're looking for color and clarity.

262
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,566
-感觉一下它。好了么？-好了。
-Just get a sense of it. Okay?- Okay.

263
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:33,661
是稠还是稀？是水状还是浆状？
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

264
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,637
-好了么？-好了。
- Okay?- Okay.

265
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,640
现在倾斜一点。
Now tip it.

266
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:42,202
现在要做的是在它靠近杯边缘稀薄的地方检查颜色的密度。
What you're doing here is checking for colordensity as it thins out towards the rim.

267
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:45,215
这会告诉你酒有多陈，当然还有其他的。
That's gonna tell you how old it is,among other things.

268
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,217
通常这对红酒更加重要。
It's usuallymore important with reds.

269
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,219
-好了么？-好了。
- Okay?- Okay.

270
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,221
现在把鼻子伸进去。
Now stick your nose in it.

271
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,723
-对么？-不要害羞。
- [ Sniffs ] Yeah?- Don't be shy.

272
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,089
真的要把鼻子放进去。真的--
Really get your nose right in there.Really--

273
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,754
呒， 一点橘子味。
Mmm. A little citrus.

274
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,891
好像还有点草莓。呒。
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

275
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,729
西番莲果。呒。
Passion fruit. Mmm.

276
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:09,739
还有-- 啊，好像还有点， 非常淡的...
And-- Ah, there's just,like, the faintest...

277
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:13,402
很轻微的，像芦笋， 还有--
[ Sniffs ]soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and--

278
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:16,481
有那么点隐隐约约的，像--
There's a--just a flutter of, like, a--

279
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:19,414
像，坚果伊顿奶酪。
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

280
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:21,509
哇。
- Wow.- [ Sniffs ]

281
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,520
呒。
Mmm!

282
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,522
-草莓。对。-好。
- Strawberries. Yeah.- Good.

283
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,751
-草莓而已。没有奶酪。-好吧。
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.- All right.

284
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,760
放下杯子。让它进点空气。
Put your glass down.Get some air into it.

285
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:32,762
氧化能将它打开。
Oxygenating it opens it up.

286
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:35,526
释放出香气和滋味。非常重要。
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.Very important.

287
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,966
再闻。
- Smell again.- [ Both Inhaling ]

288
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,970
啊。对每一杯都要这样做。
Ah. That's what you dowith every one of'em.

289
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:43,540
-哇。那我们什么时候才能喝？-现在。
- Wow. When do we drink it?- Now.

290
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,239
呒！啊。
Mmm! Ahh.

291
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,878
-呒。-你给这个酒打几分，Miles?
- Mmm.- How would you rate this one, Miles?

292
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,647
嗯，通常他们一开始给你的酒都像给有学习障碍的人准备的...
Well, usually they start you on wineswith learning disabilities...

293
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,655
不过这个确实很好。
but this one is pretty damn good.

294
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:02,625
-这个是新酒，对吧，Chris?-两个月前才出的。
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?-Just released two months ago.

295
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,627
-很不错。-我们都喜欢。
- Nice job.- We like it.

296
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:06,993
你可以在葡萄酒店工作，Miles.Miles.
You could work in a wine store,Miles.

297
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:09,999
唔，是啊。可能是个好出路。
Mmm. Yeah.That'd be a good move.

298
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,838
你在嚼口香糖么？
Are you chewing gum?

299
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,810
你觉得我和Christine结婚会不会是个错误？
Do you think I'm making a mistakemarrying Christine?

300
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:55,812
哇呜！
Whoa!

301
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:59,315
你觉得我做的对么， Miles?说实话。
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?Tell me the truth.

302
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,749
我的意思是，你是过来人。
I mean, you've been there.

303
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:05,755
嗯，是这样，我认为你曾经的等待很有道理...
Well, you know, I-- I think that youwaited for some good reason...

304
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,758
你向Christine求婚也很有道理...
and that you proposed to Christinefor some good reason...

305
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,260
所以我觉得这是很好的事。
so I think it's great.

306
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:13,263
是时候了。
It's time.

307
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:16,266
我是说，你得把眼睛睁大点，这就行了。
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,that's all.

308
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:20,270
我的意思是，你看看我。我原以为我和Victoria能安稳过一辈子。
I mean, look at me.I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

309
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:23,273
Christine的爸爸，他居然跟我谈了...
Christine's dad,he's really been talking to me...

310
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,277
让我加入他的房地产生意，传授给我其中的窍门。
about bringing me into his property business,showing me the ropes.

311
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:31,281
这可意义重大。想想他用了多长时间才接受了我不是亚美尼亚人的事实。
Which is something, considering how longit took him to get over my not being Armenian.

312
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:33,283
所以我总在想。
So I'm thinking about it.

313
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,285
不过我也不知道。
But I don't know.

314
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:37,287
可能会有点乱。
Might get a little incestuous.

315
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:40,290
不过Mike做的很好。很多高端的商业东西。
But Mike does great.A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

316
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:42,792
-那你以后就放弃表演了？-不可能，不会。
- So you're gonna stop acting?- No way! No.

317
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:45,624
这只是为了生活稳定。
This would just provide some stability.

318
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,359
我总能挤出时间，时不时参加个广告或者试演什么的。
I could always squeeze in a commercialor an audition here, there.

319
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,368
我得保持状态，万一好机会来了呢。
Keep myself in the game in casesomething really great came along.

320
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,370
我们都不再年轻了，Miles.
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

321
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,099
对，不再了。
No. No.

322
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:04,247
嗨，嗨，嗨！嗨。
- Hey, hey, hey.!- Hey.

323
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,249
-Miles!-先生。
- Miles!- Sir.

324
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,751
-好久不见了。-Gary, 很高兴见到你。
- Long time no see.- Gary, nice to see you.

325
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,754
-你的小说什么时候出来？我们都等着读呢。-马上了，马上了。
- When's your novel coming out?We all wanna read it.- Soon, soon, soon.

326
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:14,757
这是我的老朋友，Jack.他下星期要结婚了。
This is my buddyJack.He's getting married next week.

327
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:17,259
我哀悼一下，伙计。你们今晚去哪里喝？
- My condolences, man.- What are you pouring tonight?

328
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:20,263
-呃，我们有很多上等货。-嗯哼？
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.- Mm-hmm?

329
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:23,266
啊，我们有，呃，新的Bien Nacido酒。想尝尝么？
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.You want a taste?

330
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:25,268
那当然。
[ Laughs ]Absolument.

331
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,271
他们这儿生产自己的酒，绝对不同凡响。
They make their own wine here.It's just outstanding.

332
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:30,341
很独特。谢谢。
Very special. Thank you.

333
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:35,346
呒！
Mmm!

334
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:38,939
-呒。-你觉得怎么样？
- Mmm.- So, what do you think?

335
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,887
比修女的xx还要紧。浓度很好，原料不错。
Tighter than a nun's asshole.But good concentration. Nice fruit.

336
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,355
给我们倒两杯，好么。
Pour us a couple, will ya.

337
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:49,552
对，是很烈。
Yeah. It's tight.

338
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:54,163
给，先生们。
There you are, gentlemen.

339
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:57,234
这瓶留给你了。很高兴见到你。
I will leave you the bottle.And it is good to see you.

340
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,903
嗨，伙计。为我最后一周的自由。
Hey, man.Here's to my last week of freedom.

341
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,906
会很好的。
It's gonna be great.

342
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,976
为我们俩。
Here's to us.

343
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,417
- Miles.- 嗯哼？
- Miles.- Mm-hmm?

344
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,919
看那个小妞。
Check out that chick.

345
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,615
哦。那是Maya。
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

346
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:22,625
- 你认识她？- 当然，我认识Maya.
- You know her?- Sure, I know Maya.

347
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:26,322
- 你认识那个妞？-是的，Jack。我每次过来都在这儿吃饭。
- You know that chick?- Yes.Jack, this is where I eatwhen I come up here.

348
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,626
懂么？这儿就好像我的办公室。
You know?It's practically my office.

349
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,634
偶尔我会和在这儿工作的人喝一杯，就是这样。
And occasionally I have a drinkwith the employees, yeah.

350
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:35,638
Maya非常棒。她在这里工作了一年，一年半了。
Maya's great.She's worked here a year,year and a half.

351
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,640
她性感的让人难以置信。
She's incredibly hot.

352
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,006
对，她是的。她很好，不过已经结婚了。
Yes, she is.And nice. And married.

353
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:42,011
看她的大钻戒。
Check out the rock.

354
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:44,013
哦，那个屎都不算。
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

355
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:46,015
Christine在寿司店工作的时候...
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

356
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:48,847
她一直戴着大个的订婚戒指，以防男人们挑逗她。
she wore a big engagement ringto keep guys from hitting on her.

357
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:51,854
有用么？他妈一点用没有。你以为我是怎么认识她的？
Think it worked? Fuck no.How do you think I met her?

358
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:56,859
嗯，这个女孩嫁的可是加州圣巴巴拉大学的哲学教授。
Well, this gal is married to somephilosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

359
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,294
教授的太太做女招待说明什么？明显婚姻完蛋了。
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?Obviously that's over.

360
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,299
Jack, 你并不了解这个女人。
Jack, you don't know anythingabout this woman.

361
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:06,495
冷静点。吃饭吧。
Calm down. Let's just eat.

362
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:11,836
- 嗨，Miles!- 哦，嗨，Maya.
- Hey, Miles!- Oh! Hi, Maya.

363
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,844
- 你好么？- 我很好，很好。
- How are you?- I'm good. Good.

364
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:17,574
你看上气色不错。是不是减肥了？
You look great.Did you lose some weight?

365
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:21,276
呃...事实上，没有。
Uh... no, actually.

366
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:23,183
可是... 谢谢。
But... thank you.[ Chuckles ]

367
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:25,756
- 晚上很忙，嗯？- 星期天嘛。
- Busy night, huh?- Sunday.

368
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:27,757
你们俩出来品酒的？
You guys been out tasting?

369
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:30,020
哦，你说对了，说对了。
Oh, you know it. You know it.

370
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:32,221
哦，这是我的朋友， Jack.Jack，这是Maya.
Oh, this is my friend,Jack.Jack, Maya.

371
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,230
- 嗨，Maya.- 嗨。
- Hiya.- Hi.

372
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:36,926
那，很高兴见到你。再见，Miles.
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

373
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:39,526
哦，得回去工作了。
Oh. Back to work.

374
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,607
-上帝，她真勾魂。-是的。
-Jesus, she is jammin'.- Yeah.

375
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,609
很明显她喜欢你。
And she's obviously into you.

376
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:48,611
对她，你还了解什么？

我们怎么可能？

你这家伙。怎么你总是盯着坏的一面？
You dick. Why do you have tofocus on the negative?

383
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:08,694
- 看看她对你多亲切？- 她只是为了小费。
- See how friendly she was to you?- She works for tips.

384
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:12,401
你瞎了，伙计。瞎了。

我想我们就回汽车旅馆睡觉。

427
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,729
这女孩想要个派对...
The girl is looking to party...

428
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,732
你却告诉她我们要回汽车旅馆睡觉？
and you tell her we're going backto the motel and crash?

429
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,734
-上帝啊，Miles!-唉，我累了，Jack.

- Aren't you tired?- The chick digs you, man!

她容光焕发象个弹球机...
She lit up like a pinball machine...

432
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,740
在她听说你的小说要出版的时候。
when she found outyour novel was getting published.

433
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:34,243
现在我不得不活在另一个谎言中。

00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:37,246
-谢谢你，Jack.-我只是想让你行动起来。

我就很乐意接受一些帮助。
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

436
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:43,252
我不觉得你那是在帮我。你把她全忘了。
Didn't seem to me like that's whatwas going on. You were all over her.

437
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:45,754
噢，你就一定要教训我。
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

438
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:48,758
而且，我猜对了--她的婚姻完了。
And, by the way, I was right--she's not married.

439
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,919
-你怎么知道。-没钻戒。
- How do you know?- No rock.

440
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:54,658
她在酒吧的时候没戴钻戒。
When she came to the bar,she was sans rock.

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,968

442
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:19,583
今天的计划是什么，Miles?

443
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,590
阿哈。

00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:24,286
好。呃，我们先朝北去--
Good. Um, we head up north--

445
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,295
从那儿开始我们的葡萄之旅...

446
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:28,297
一路往南...

447
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,299
这样，我们喝的越多...
so that the more we drink...

448
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,460
就离我们的汽车旅馆越近。
the closer we get to the motel.

449
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:38,799
你到底有什么问题？

450
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:46,516
怎么了？
What is it?

451
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:51,687
我这次旅程一定要找点刺激，Miles...
I'm going to get my nuton this trip, Miles...

452
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:54,690
你别坏我的事...
and you are not gonnafuck it up for me...

453
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:59,422
别用你那些沮丧，焦虑，那些他妈的负面思想。
with all of your depression and anxietyand neg-head downer shit.

454
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,361
哦。
[ Chuckles ]Oh.

455
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:04,492
好啊，你都摊牌了。
Well, now the cards are on the table.

456
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:06,502
对，没错。
Yes, they are.

457
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:10,096
-啊。-我是认真的。别坏我的事，Miles.
- Ah.- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.

458
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:14,872
我要在周六结婚前操一顿。你懂不懂？
I am going to get laid before I get marriedon Saturday. Do you read me?

459
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,280
懂，老大，当然懂。
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

460
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,282
你讲的每个字都声音又大又清楚。
Loud and clear.Whatever you say.

461
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,614
显然，你在为你想要得派对生气。
It's, uh,your party, evidently.

462
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,620
你为什么不干脆，呃--
Why don't you just, uh--

463
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:28,624
呃，对，你为什么不干脆自己去，我可以搭火车回去。
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,and I'll catch a train back.

464
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,626
不，Miles!
No, Miles!

465
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,196
伙计，这周我们要疯狂。
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

466
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:35,197
我们两个都要放纵一下。
We should both be cutting loose.

467
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,133
这是我们最后的机会了。这是我们的一星期，伙计。
This could be our last chance.This is our week, man.

468
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:42,937
我们必须分享。

469
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:18,468
这是我们的席拉（Syrah）酒。

470
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,544

-喔！-好吧？喜欢么？

这个味很重。
That's a big one.

473
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:38,428
这酒要连葡萄皮一起在一个开口的酒桶中放两个星期。
[ Woman ] But it did sit with the skins forabout two weeks in an open-topped tank.

474
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:41,930
-难怪有单宁酸味儿，对不？-是啊，这酒还很新。
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?- Well, it is a young wine.

475
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:45,560
-就是说当酒越放越陈，单宁酸就会挥散掉。-对，当然。
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.- Right. Of course.

476
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,503
-抱歉等我一下。-真是好东西。
- Excuse me for just a minute.- Good stuff.

477
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,134

00:31:27,878 --> 00:31:29,778
你觉得怎么样？
So, what do you think?

483
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,780
呒，可以一饮而尽。
Mmm. Quaffable.

484
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:34,112
不过离卓越还差很多。
But, uh, far from transcendent.

485
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:36,118
我喜欢。味道很好。

这个是品丽珠红葡萄酒（cabernet franc）

我们生产这种单品葡萄酒才第五年。
This is only the fifth yearwe've made this varietal.

489
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,754
周围很少有酒园子做纯的cab franc酒。
Very few wineries around heredo a straight cab franc.

490

那么，我想说的是
Well, I will tell you something.

496
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:02,910
我从来就没觉得cab franc酒有什么妙处，这次也不例外。
I've come never to expect greatness froma cab franc, and this one is no different.

497
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:05,915
有一种空洞的，松弛的，熟过头的感觉--
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--

498
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,417
我不知道。对我来说味道不错。
I don't know.Tastes pretty good to me.

Do you happen to know a gal named Mayathat works at The Hitching Post?

因为我不会去那儿的。

也许你不去婚礼更好一些。
Maybe it is betterif you don't come to the wedding.

-给你一个，我三个。-呒。
- One for you, three for me.- Mmm.

769
00:48:49,419 --> 00:48:51,319
你确定你想这样么？
You sure you wanna do this?

770
00:48:57,927 --> 00:48:59,827
-我们来了！-嗨！
- We're here!- [ Stephanie ] Hey.!

771
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:02,261
-嗨！-你们去哪儿了？
- Hey!- Where were you guys?

772
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:06,597
噢，我们拐错了几个弯，多亏了还有麦哲伦。
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,thanks to Magellan here.

773
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:08,728
-嗨！-嗨！
- [ Whispers ] Hi.- Hi.

774
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:10,738
-噢，Miles.-什么？
- Oh, Miles.- Yeah?

775
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,741
-Maya在后面，过了厨房就是。-好的。
- Maya's in the back,just past the kitchen.- Okay.

776
00:49:13,843 --> 00:49:15,743
谢谢。
- [Jack Chuckles ]- Thanks.

777
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:26,688
嗨。
Hi.

778
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,815
嘿。
Hey.

779
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:31,689
-哦，她有什么好酒么？-噢，是的。
- Oh, has she got anything good?- Oh,yeah.

780
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:34,662
Stephanie对皮诺酒和席拉酒很着迷。
Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.

781
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,664
-嗨，Stephanie？-怎么了？
- Hey, Steph!- Yeah?

782
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:40,566
-我们是不是想开哪瓶就开哪瓶？-对对，随便。
- Can we really open anything we want?- Yeah,yeah. Anything.

783
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,968
噢，除了那瓶Richebourg。
Uh, except the Richebourg.

784
00:49:43,073 --> 00:49:46,531
Richebourg？她居然有Richebourg？Holy mackerel.
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?Holy mackerel.

785
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:48,543
我真是低估了Stephanie了。
I've completelyunderestimated Stephanie.

786
00:49:48,645 --> 00:49:51,910
噢，上帝，看这个。
Oh, good Lord. Um, look at that.

787
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:58,181
我想...这个酒更适合我们的口味。
I think... this guy's more our speed.

788
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:00,188
Andrew Murray.
Andrew Murray.

789
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,690
好的。
Well, okay. All right.

790
00:50:05,328 --> 00:50:08,229
那，你的收藏中有什么宝贝？
So, what gems do you havein your collection?

791
00:50:08,331 --> 00:50:11,459
噢，其实都算不上什么收藏。
Oh, it's really not muchof a collection, you know.

792
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:14,469
我的意思是更像是放在柜子里的一点东西。
I mean, more like a small gatheringin a cabinet.

793
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:17,472
我从来没钱买那些。
- [ Laughs ]- No, I've never really had the wallet for that.

794
00:50:17,574 --> 00:50:19,974
我就是忍不住要一瓶一瓶的喝。
I just have to live bottle to bottle.

795
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:22,476
不过我还是省了些下来，当然了。
I've got things I'm saving, definitely.

796
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:26,982
我想起中的明星就是那瓶1961年的Cheval Blanc。
I guess the star would bea 1961 Cheval Blanc.

797
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:29,984
你有一瓶61年的Cheval Blanc，却放在那里不动？
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,and it's just sitting there?

798
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:31,986
-是的，是的。-快去拿。
- Yes, I do.- Go get it.

799
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:33,988
-好了。-我是认真的！快去！
- [ Laughing ] Okay.- I'm serious! Hurry!

800
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,990
好的，我会去拿的。
All right. I would, I would.

801
00:50:36,092 --> 00:50:39,084
61年的酒现在正是最好的时候，是吧？我从书上看的。
The '61 s are peaking right now, aren't they?That's what I've read.

802
00:50:39,195 --> 00:50:41,095
不，对，是的。
No, that's right, yeah.

803
00:50:41,197 --> 00:50:44,098
可能都已经有点晚了。你还在等什么？
It might be too late already.What are you waiting for?

804
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,102
噢，我不知道。一个特别的场合和最合适的人。
Oh, I don't know.A special occasion with the right person.

805
00:50:48,204 --> 00:50:52,504
-本来是准备在结婚10周年的时候，但是---呒。
- It was supposed to be formy 1 0th wedding anniversary, but--- Mmm.

806
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:55,908
你知道，当你打开61年的Cheval Blanc的时候
You know, the day you opena '6 1 Cheval Blanc...

807
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,980
那就是那个特别的时候。
that's the special occasion.

808
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:04,418
嗯，你对葡萄酒感兴趣有多长时间了？
So, uh, how longhave you been into wine?

809
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,354
从我认真开始算起有7年了。
I got serious about seven years ago.

810
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:10,790
-是哪瓶酒让你开始的？-88年的Sassicaia。
- And what was the bottle that did it?- '88 Sassicaia.

811
00:51:10,894 --> 00:51:13,192
-啊。很好。恭喜。-呒。
- Ah.! Well, congratulations.- Mmm.

812
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:15,196
-是啊。-非常好。
- Yeah.- That's very good.

813
00:51:15,298 --> 00:51:17,562
-很好---真能让你着迷。是的。
- Well--- That would do it. Yeah.

814
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,567
嗯。
Hmm.

815
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,637
呒。
Mmm.

816
00:51:24,073 --> 00:51:26,234
哦，哇，真好。真是非常好。
Oh, wow, that's nice.That's very good.

817
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:29,243
我们应该多品一会儿，不过实在是味道太好了。
We need to give it a minute,but that's really tasty.

818
00:51:29,345 --> 00:51:31,313
你觉得呢？
How about you?

819
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:36,317
我觉得他们做的有点儿过了。
I think they overdid it a little.

820
00:51:36,419 --> 00:51:38,717
太多酒精味儿，把葡萄的味儿都盖住了。
Too much alcohol.It overwhelms the fruit.

821
00:51:38,822 --> 00:51:40,790
唔。
Huh.

822
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,794
是的，是的。
Yeah. Yeah.

823
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,296
我得说你对钱的态度是对的。
I'd say you're right on the money.

824
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,799
非常好。很好。
Very good. [ Chuckles ] Nice.

825
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:53,869
-谢谢。-呒。
- Thank you.- Mmm.

826
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:58,172
呒。那是Stephanie的孩子么？
Mmm! Is that Stephanie's kid?

827
00:51:58,274 --> 00:52:00,174
哦，是的。那是Siena.
Oh. Yeah. That's Siena.

828
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:03,074
-哦，她是个小甜心。-很可爱，很可爱。
- Oh, she's a sweetie.- Cute. Cute.

829
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:05,079
她现在在哪里？
Where is she?

830
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:07,081
-在她祖母家。-哦。
- She's at her grandmother's.- Oh.

831
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:09,413
在Stephanie的妈妈那里。她经常待在那里。
Steph's mom.She spends a lot of time over there.

832
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:11,419
你有孩子么？
You got kids?

833
00:52:11,521 --> 00:52:13,421
哦，我？没有，没有。
Uh, me? No. No.

834
00:52:13,523 --> 00:52:16,924
没有，我会把他们都带坏的。
- No, I'd just fuck 'em up.- [ Laughs ]

835
00:52:17,026 --> 00:52:21,588
没有，这是我的离婚中没有被污染的部分--没有孩子。
No, that was the one unpolluted partof my divorce-- no kids.

836
00:52:21,698 --> 00:52:23,598
对。我也是。
Yeah. Same here.

837
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,600
很好。
Good.

838
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:27,670
我们出去吧。
Let's go in there.

839
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:33,836
现在，以很低很低的4.8%的年利率--
[Jack ] Now, for a low, low4.8% A.P.R. financing--

840
00:52:45,054 --> 00:52:47,955
看起来我们的朋友们谈的很投机。
Looks like our friendsare really hitting it off.

841
00:52:48,057 --> 00:52:50,457
对，我也这么觉得。
- Yeah, I would say that.- [ Laughs ]

842
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,028
是的。
- Yeah.- [ Sighs ]

843
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:56,030
那，你的小说是关于什么的？
- [ Clears Throat ]- So, what's your novel about?

844
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,032
是我的--哦 兄弟。
What's my-- Oh, brother.

845
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:01,535
嗯，这个，呃――这很难总结。
Well, it's, uh--it's difficult to summarize.

846
00:53:01,638 --> 00:53:03,538
呒...
Um...

847
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,541
开始是一种第一人称叙述...
it starts out as a kind offirst-person narrative...

848
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:09,908
一个男人照顾他中风后的父亲。
about a guy taking careof his father after a stroke.

849
00:53:10,013 --> 00:53:13,244
-哦。-这个有点根据我的个人经历。
- Oh.- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.

850
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:15,249
不过只是--只是大体上。
But only-- only loosely.

851
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:17,251
小说名字叫什么？
What's the title?

852
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:19,253
昨天的明天。
The Day After Yesterday.

853
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:21,789
哦，你是说今天。
Oh. You mean today.

854
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:27,387
呃...呃，是的。我是说，对。不过没那么简单--
Um... uh, yeah.I mean, r-right. But it's more--

855
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:31,126
是不是关于，比如，死亡和永恒，或者--
So it's about, like,death and mortality, or--

856
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:33,794
哦，对--
[ Sighs ]Uh, yeah--

857
00:53:33,903 --> 00:53:35,803
对，不过也不全是。
Y-- Not really.

858
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:38,806
我，哦--用了很多跳跃式结构。
I, uh-- It de-- It jumps around a lot.

859
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:41,741
这是我想表达的，从某种意义上。你懂我的意思么？
That's what it's about, in a way.You know what I mean?

860
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,745
你开始以父亲的眼光看周围的一切。
You start to see everythingfrom the point of view of the father.

861
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,248
并且，呃，同时有很多其他事情发生了--并列叙述。
And, uh, a lot of other things happen--parallel narratives.

862
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,251
有点乱。
[ Laughs ]It's kind of a mess.

863
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,254
然后，最终整个事情向前发展...
And then, eventually,the whole thing sort of evolves...

864
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,256
或者衰退...
or devolves...

865
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,656
最后成为一种Robbe-Grillet 式的迷.
into this sort ofRobbe-Grillet mystery.

866
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,660
你明白么？
You know?

867
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:01,753
但是没有真正的答案。
But no real resolution.

868
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,196
-喔。-这个--
- Wow.- [ Chuckles ] It--

869
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,292
嗯。我觉得你能出版它真是太棒了。
Well, I think it's really greatyou're getting it published.

870
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:10,372
真的。我是说，我知道仅仅把它写出来就很难了。
Really. I mean, I know how hard it isjust to write it, even.

871
00:54:10,473 --> 00:54:12,373
是啊。
Yeah.

872
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:15,638
我是说，像我，我的论文星期五就要交了...
I mean, like me, I've got this paperdue on Friday...

873
00:54:15,745 --> 00:54:18,646
我紧张的一塌糊涂，像高中生一样。
and I'm freaked out about it,just like in high school.

874
00:54:18,748 --> 00:54:20,807
-论文，嗯？-对。
- A paper, huh?- Yeah.

875
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:23,818
我正在读园艺学的硕士学位。
I'm going for a master's degreein horticulture.

876
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,286
慢慢啃的。
Sorta chipping away on it.

877
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:29,051
-园艺学？真的？-唔。
- Horticulture? Really?- Mmm.

878
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:32,184
我都不知道这附近还有大学。
I didn't even knowthat there was a college here.

879
00:54:32,295 --> 00:54:35,696
噢，我跑通勤到San Luis Obispo，两周一次。
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispotwice a week.

880
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:38,323
园艺学？喔。
Horticulture? Wow.

881
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:41,403
那你是想在酿酒园还是什么地方工作？
So, do you want to workin a winery or something?

882
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:44,029
可能吧。
Maybe.

883
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,176
噢。
Oh.

884
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:51,412
呒。
Hmm.

885
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:53,539
那，我什么时候才能读你的书？
So, when can I read your book?

886
00:54:55,652 --> 00:54:59,782
嗯，我--你知道，我正好有手稿在车里。
Well, I-- You know, I-- Well, I do happento have a manuscript in my car.

887
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:01,720
呃，还没有校对过...
Um, it's not proofed or anything...

888
00:55:01,824 --> 00:55:04,019
所以会有很多书写错误。
so it's-- it's full of typos.

889
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:06,721
-如果你不介意书写错误---不介意，谁管呀？
- If you don't mind typos--- Oh, no. Who cares?

890
00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:08,729
我可是错别字大王。
I'm the queen of typos.

891
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:10,799
好的。
Okay.

892
00:55:41,364 --> 00:55:43,594
呒。
Mmm.

893
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,668
啊。
Ahh.

894
00:55:47,503 --> 00:55:51,405
能问你个私人问题么，Miles?
You know, can I ask youa personal question, Miles?

895
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:53,407
当然。
Sure.

896
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:55,409
你为什么那么喜欢皮诺？
Why are you so into pinot?

897
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:58,674
我的意思是，就好像你的一个特征一样。
- [ Laughing ]- I mean, it's like a thing with you.

898
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:02,549
呃...我也不知道，我也不知道。
Uh... I don't know. I don't know.

899
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:06,884
呃...只是一种很难种植的葡萄。
Um... it's a hard grape to grow.

900
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,150
你应该知道，对吧？
As you know. Right?

901
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:11,556
它，呃，它皮很薄...
It's, uh-- It's thin-skinned...

902
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:14,391
喜怒无常，熟得很早。
temperamental, ripens early.

903
00:56:15,565 --> 00:56:17,465
它--你知道，它很难生存...
It's-- You know, it's not a survivor...

904
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,467
不像卡博耐(cabernet)...
like cabernet...

905
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:21,469
可以在任何地方生长...
which can just grow anywhere...

906
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:24,472
甚至没人管也能兴旺。
and thrive even when it's neglected.

907
00:56:24,574 --> 00:56:28,271
不行，皮诺需要持久的关心和照料。你知道？
No, pinot needs constant careand attention. You know?

908
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:30,777
其实，它只能长在...
And, in fact, it can only grow...

909
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,816
那些极特别的地方世界很少的几个角落。
in these really specific,little tucked-away corners of the world.

910
00:56:36,953 --> 00:56:38,853
只有--只有...
And-- And only...

911
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:43,858
最耐心最精心的种植者
the most patientand nurturing of growers...

912
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,485
can do it, really.才能种它，真的。
can do it, really.

913
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:49,588
只有那些真正愿意花时间的人...
Only somebodywho really takes the time...

914
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:53,533
真正理解皮诺潜力的人...
to understand pinot's potential...

915
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:56,537
才能引导它进入全盛阶段。
can then coax itinto its fullest expression.

916
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:59,972
然后呢？我是指--
And then? I mean--

917
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:03,204
哦，它的香味儿，是最持久最辉煌的...
Oh, its flavors, they're justthe most haunting and brilliant...

918
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:06,873
最震撼最微妙的...
and thrilling and subtle and...

919
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:10,915
最古老的，在整个星球上。
ancient on the planet.

920
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:18,859
我是说，你知道，卡博耐也能很强健很显耀...
No, I mean, you know, cabernetscan be powerful and exalting too...

921
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:22,522
但它们对我来说太平凡了，因为某种原因，相对而言。
but they seem prosaic to me,for some reason, by comparison.

922
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:24,964
我不知道，我不知道。
- [ Laughing ]- I don't know. I don't know.

923
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,967
你觉得呢？
What about you?

924
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,969
我觉得什么？
What about me?

925
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:32,404
不知道。你为什么对葡萄酒着迷？
I don't know.Why are you into wine?

926
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,911
噢，我--我想 我--
Oh, I-- I think I--

927
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:40,414
-我最初对酒着迷是因为我的前夫。-啊。
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.- Ah.

928
00:57:40,516 --> 00:57:44,384
你知道，他有一个很大的值得炫耀的酒窖。
You know, he had this bigsort of show-off cellar.

929
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:46,387
-明白么?-对。
- You know?- Right.

930
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:50,220
-然后我发现我的味觉非常敏锐。-嗯哼。
- But then I discovered thatI had a really sharp palate.- Mm-hmm.

931
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:52,226
我喝的越多...
And the more I drank...

932
00:57:52,328 --> 00:57:55,263
我就越喜欢它使我产生的思想。
the more I likedwhat it made me think about.

933
00:57:55,364 --> 00:57:57,264
比方说？
Like what?

934
00:57:57,366 --> 00:57:59,266
比方说我意识到他是一个骗子。
Like what a fraud he was.

935
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,529
喔。
[ Laughs ]Wow.

936
00:58:01,637 --> 00:58:05,164
不，我的意思是，我喜欢去思考酒的生命。
No, I mean, I like to thinkabout the life of wine.

937
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,174
嗯。
Yeah.

938
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,244
它是一种怎样一种有生命的东西。
How it's a living thing.

939
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,880
我喜欢思考...
I like to think about...

940
00:58:12,982 --> 00:58:16,383
在葡萄成熟的一年里会发生什么...
what was going on the yearthe grapes were growing...

941
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:18,817
太阳是怎样照耀的...
how the sun was shining...

942
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:20,889
在下雨的时候。
if it rained.

943
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:23,991
我喜欢思考...
I like to think about...

944
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:27,460
那些照顾和采摘葡萄的人们...
all the people who tendedand picked the grapes...

945
00:58:27,563 --> 00:58:32,023
如果是陈年的酒的话，有多少人现在已经不在人世了。
and, if it's an old wine,how many of them must be dead by now.

946
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:37,768
我喜欢葡萄酒在不停的进化。
I like how wine continues to evolve.

947
00:58:37,874 --> 00:58:40,775
好比，如果我今天打开一瓶酒的话...
Like,if I opened a bottle of wine today...

948
00:58:40,877 --> 00:58:44,904
它的味道会不同与我在其他日子打开它。
it would taste different than ifI'd opened it on any other day.

949
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:49,417
因为一瓶酒其实是有生命的...
Because a bottle of wineis actually alive...

950
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:54,478
而且它不停的进化，不停的得到新的元素。
and it's constantly evolvingand gaining complexity.

951
00:58:56,025 --> 00:58:58,585
这样，直到它的顶峰...
That is, until it peaks...

952
00:58:58,694 --> 00:59:00,594
就像你那瓶61年的酒。
like your '61 .

953
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:05,162
然后它开始了平稳的...
And then it begins its steady...

954
00:59:05,268 --> 00:59:08,169
不可避免的衰退。
inevitable decline.

955
00:59:08,271 --> 00:59:10,796
嗯。
Hmm.

956
00:59:11,908 --> 00:59:15,036
它的口味变的真他妈的好。
And it tastes so fucking good.

957
00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:34,795
嗯。
Yeah.

958
00:59:34,897 --> 00:59:37,457
不过你知道，我--我，呃--
But you know, I-- I, uh--

959
00:59:37,566 --> 00:59:39,966
我还喜欢皮诺以外的其他葡萄酒。
I like other wines besides pinot too.

960
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:42,765
我是说，最近我开始非常喜欢雷斯林（Rieslings）。
I mean, latelyI've been really into Rieslings.

961
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:46,104
你喜欢雷斯林？雷斯林？
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?

962
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,937
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

963
00:59:50,513 --> 00:59:52,413
这后面有洗手间么？
There's a bathroom in the back?

964
00:59:52,515 --> 00:59:55,211
-有，穿过厨房就是。-我马上回来。
- Yeah. It's through the kitchen.- I'll be right back.

965
01:00:08,092 --> 01:00:11,357
上帝，你他妈的衰人。
[ Exhales ]God, you are such a fuckin' loser.

966
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:14,556
你真他妈让我恶心。
You make me so fuckin' sick.

967
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:17,760
噢，上帝。啊，来吧。
[ Groaning ]Oh, God. Ah, come on.

968
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,820
嗨。
Hi.

969
01:00:37,922 --> 01:00:39,890
-我过来拿点水。-嗯。
- I was just getting some water.- Okay.

970
01:00:39,991 --> 01:00:42,016
-你要水么？-不。
- You want some water?- No.

971
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:44,651
好了。现在已经很晚了。
Okay. It's getting kind of late.

972
01:00:54,005 --> 01:00:56,030
我真的得走了。
I should really go.

973
01:01:27,305 --> 01:01:29,773
你知道去“风车”该怎么走吧？两个右转再一个左转。
So you know how to get to the Windmill?Two rights and a left.

974
01:01:29,874 --> 01:01:31,842
-知道了。-好的。
- Got it.- Okay.

975
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:34,411
我晚上过的很愉快，Miles.真的。
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.I really did.

976
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:37,379
好。我也是。
Good. So did I.

977
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:42,518
-那好吧，再会了。-呃--
- Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.- Um--

978
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:46,488
你还想看我的小说么？
Did you still want to read my novel?

979
01:01:46,591 --> 01:01:49,321
噢，是的，当然。
Oh, yeah. Of course.

980
01:01:51,596 --> 01:01:54,087
[嘀咕]
[ Groans ]

981
01:01:54,198 --> 01:01:56,098
是的。
Yeah.

982
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:00,168
-太好了。-等一下。
- Great.-Just a sec.

983
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:06,339
-给。-噢，喔。
- Here.- Oh, wow.

984
01:02:06,444 --> 01:02:08,412
我希望你喜欢。
Well, I hope you like it.

985
01:02:08,513 --> 01:02:13,246
你什么时候看不下去了就别看了，我不会生气的。
And feel free to stop reading it any time.I will not be offended.

986
01:02:13,351 --> 01:02:15,478
好。
Okay.

987
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:18,214
-那，晚安，Miles.-晚安。
- Well, good night, Miles.- Good night.

988
01:03:04,435 --> 01:03:06,403
哦，靠。
Oh, fuck.

989
01:03:14,245 --> 01:03:16,543
哦，靠。
[ Groans ]Oh, fuck.

990
01:03:38,603 --> 01:03:42,664
那个妞真他妈的难以置信，伙计。难以置信！
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.Unbelievable!

991
01:03:42,774 --> 01:03:45,038
喔！
Whoo! Boy.

992
01:03:45,143 --> 01:03:48,510
哦，她可真下流，Miles.
Ohh, she is nasty, Miles.

993
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:51,707
下流，下流，下流！
Nasty, nasty, nasty.!

994
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:56,227
-嗯，我很高兴你终于发泄了。-是啊，哥们。
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.- Yeah, baby.

995
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:58,827
恭喜你。任务完成了。
Congratulations.Mission accomplished.

996
01:04:02,307 --> 01:04:04,413
哦，嗨，Miles!
Oh, hi, Miles!

997
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:07,185
嗨！
Hi.

998
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,374
嘿，你不会请了Stephanie和我们一起去吧？
- [ Toilet Flushing ]- Hey, you didn't invite Stephanieto come with us, did you?

999
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:12,864
哦，听着，伙计，计划有变了。Stephanie今天不上班，
Oh, listen, man. Change of plans.Stephanie's off today,

1000
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:14,889
所以，你看，我想和她去爬山。
so, you know,I'm thinkin' about goin' on a hike.

1001
01:04:15,596 --> 01:04:18,422
我们本来今天要去打高尔夫的。
We were supposed to play golf.

1002
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:21,888
你觉得怎么样？你自己去，伙计。你自己去。事实上，你可以用我的会员卡。
You know what? You go, man.You go. In fact, use my clubs.

1003
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:24,981
会员卡都是全新的。是Christine她爸送给我的礼物。
- They're brand-new.They were a gift from Christine's dad.- [ Disgusted Sigh ]

1004
01:04:25,088 --> 01:04:27,540
给，我请客。就用这个。
Here, I'll pay for it. Right there.

1005
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,926
等晚一些时候，我们三个可以一起去The Hitching Post。
And then later, the three of us,we can go to The Hitching Post.

1006
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,006
我们可以坐在Maya的餐桌那儿。
We could sit at one of Maya's tables.

1007
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,086
她会给我们拿些好酒，知道么？
She'll bring us some great wine,you know?

1008
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:38,604
然后我们四个可以干点什么。不，我不要。
- Then the four of us will do something.- No. Count me out.

1009
01:04:38,685 --> 01:04:41,004
哦，我明白了。
Oh, I see.

1010
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,777
昨天晚上不是很顺利，嗯？真是吃惊啊。
Didn't go so great last night, huh?What a shocker.

1011
01:04:43,857 --> 01:04:47,562
你是说喝醉了给Victoria打电话并没有使你进入状态？
You mean getting drunk and callingVictoria didn't put you in the mood?

1012
01:04:48,923 --> 01:04:51,535
妈的傻瓜。
Dumb fuck.

1013
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:56,094
晚上见，伙计。是的，不过也许你应该先查一下你的短信。
- Later, man.- Yeah, well, maybe you shouldcheck your messages first.

1014
01:05:05,479 --> 01:05:08,651
哦，天哪。
- [ Escalating Tones ]- Oh, boy.

1015
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:11,398
是的，她在这里也留言了。
Yeah, she's been leavingmessages here too.

1016
01:05:12,971 --> 01:05:14,837
嗯。好的。
Yeah. Okay.

1017
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:18,250
你应该给她打电话。我会的。再见。
- You should call her.- I will. I'll see you.

1018
01:05:18,356 --> 01:05:20,995
现在就打！好吧。靠！
- Right now!- Okay. Fuck!

1019
01:05:21,076 --> 01:05:24,275
你是谁呀？我妈？随便。
- What are you, my mom?- Well.

1020
01:05:32,913 --> 01:05:35,312
你不介意到外面等吧？
Would you mind waiting outside?

1021
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:43,951
昨天晚上过的很好。是啊。吃的东西不错。
- That was fun last night.- Yeah. Good food.

1022
01:05:44,031 --> 01:05:48,110
嘿，我-我早上和Maya谈过了。她说她昨天晚上也很开心。
Hey, I-I talked to Maya this morning.She said she had a fun time too.

1023
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,189
你应该给她打电话。
You should call her.

1024
01:05:58,428 --> 01:06:01,520
Jack在哪儿？呃，他得打个电话。
- Where's Jack?- Uh, had to make a phone call.

1025
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:04,106
哦。
Oh.

1026
01:06:06,026 --> 01:06:08,478
Miles. Miles.
Miles. Miles.

1027
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:14,663
嘿，伙计，呃，上次那个安全套你还有没有了？
Hey, man, uh, do you havethat other condom?

1028
01:06:14,744 --> 01:06:17,143
在我外套里。
In my jacket.

1029
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,196
Christine怎么说？
What did, uh, Christine say?

1030

嘿，你来了。

1041
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:33,966
是的。嘿，伙计。
- Yup.- Hey, man.

1042
01:08:34,074 --> 01:08:36,366
你在喝什么？
What are you drinking?

1043
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:38,393
好不好喝？
Is it any good?

1044
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:41,832
我能不能，能不能来一杯？
Can-- Can I get a glass, please?

1045
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:44,925
谢谢。

1046
01:08:45,032 --> 01:08:48,231
Stephanie今天带我去皮诺种植地了，Miles.
Stephanie took me outto the pinot fields today, Miles.

1047
01:08:48,311 --> 01:08:50,283
上帝，真是美啊。
God, it was so awesome.

1048
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,669
我觉得我已经对整个过程摸出些门道来了。
I think I'm really starting to geta handle on the whole process.

1049
01:08:53,803 --> 01:08:56,362
从土壤到藤蔓，还有--你们怎么说的来着--
The soil to the vine, and the--what do you call it?

1050
01:08:56,469 --> 01:08:58,681
从选种到收获。
The selection to the harvest.

1051
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:01,721
就是他们用那个很大的容器搅拌葡萄？
Then that thing they do withthe big containers where they mix it?

1052
01:09:01,828 --> 01:09:04,120
真是太棒了，整个过程。
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1053
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,919
我们还从葡萄藤上摘了皮诺葡萄吃。
Then we ate pinot grapesright off the vine.

1054
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,079
有点酸...
They were a little sour...

1055
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,958
不过表现出出色的构造潜力...
but showing excellent potentialfor structure...

1056
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:13,958
从头至尾，我认为。
down the line, I think.

1057
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:17,184
Stephanie，伙计，她可真懂行。
Stephanie, man.She really knows her shit.

1058
01:09:17,265 --> 01:09:19,744
嗯。Stephanie在哪儿？
Hmm. Where is Stephanie?

1059
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:23,636
呃，她在楼上清理清理。
Uh, she's upstairs cleaning up.

1060
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,875
你他妈的到底在干嘛？
What the fuck are you doing?

1061
01:09:27,556 --> 01:09:31,181
什么？和那个妞。
- What?- With this chick.

1062
01:09:31,315 --> 01:09:33,554
怎么了？
What?

1063
01:09:33,661 --> 01:09:35,900
她知不知道星期六的事？
Does she know about Saturday?

1064
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,459
哦，不知道吧。不过我对她是诚实的。
Well, not exactly.I've been honest with her.

1065
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,539
我并没有告诉她我是单身啊。
I haven't told her I'm available.

1066
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:43,098
她知道我们这趟旅行只有几天。
She knows this tripis only for a few days.

1067
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,871
再说，我--
Besides, I just--

1068
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:50,190
再说什么？我--嗯，你知道--
- Besides what?- I'm-- Well, you know--

1069
01:09:50,297 --> 01:09:52,269
婚礼。怎么了？
- The wedding.- What?

1070
01:09:52,377 --> 01:09:57,255
我正在考虑。
I-- I've just been doingsome thinking about it.

1071
01:09:57,389 --> 01:10:00,188
哦，你在考虑了。然后呢？
Oh, you've been thinking. And?

1072
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:06,987
也许我想把婚礼推迟一下，就这样。
Might have to putthe wedding on hold, is all.

1073
01:10:07,094 --> 01:10:10,533
你看，我知道这个很难...
Look, I know thatthat could be tricky...

1074
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:13,705
很难让人一开始就接受。嗯。
- for certain people to accept at first.- Yeah.

1075
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:16,265
是吧？不过人生很短，Miles.
All right?But life is short, Miles.

1076
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:20,344
我必须在做出这样一个重大决定前确定自己这样做是正确的。
I have to be sure I'm doing the right thingbefore taking such a big step.

1077
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,903
你知道么？这也不是光光为了我自己。
You know what?That's not just for my sake.

1078
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,182
我也是为Christine的感情着想。
I'm looking outfor Christine's feelings too.

1079
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:30,102
我是说，和Stephanie在一起让我大开眼界。
I mean, being with Stephaniehas completely opened my eyes.

1080
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:33,008
她不保守，没有控制欲。她很棒。
She's not uptight or controlling.She's just cool.

1081
01:10:33,088 --> 01:10:36,660
我是说，她闻起来是不一样的，她尝起来是不一样的。
I mean, she smells different,she tastes different.

1082
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:38,739
她操起来也是不一样的。好吧。
- She fucks different.- Okay.

1083
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,139
她操起来象个动物。
She fucks like an animal.

1084
01:10:41,246 --> 01:10:44,365
我得告诉你，伙计。
I gotta tell you, man.

1085
01:10:44,499 --> 01:10:47,618
我昨天晚上插的很深。
I went deep last night.

1086
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:49,617
很深。

01:10:49,724 --> 01:10:52,443
很深。
Deep.

1088
01:10:52,577 --> 01:10:56,016
我原以为我可以从你这儿得到些理解，看来我得不到了。
I thought I'd get a little understandingfrom you, but I'm not gonna get that.

1089
01:10:56,123 --> 01:10:58,602
理解什么，Jack?
Understanding about what,Jack?

1090
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:04,414
我可能爱上另一个女人了。
- I might be in love with another woman.- [ Laughs ]

1091
01:11:04,495 --> 01:11:06,414
爱上？真的？
In love? Really?

1092
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:10,439
和一个倒酒的女人呆24个小时，你就他妈的爱上她了？
Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourerchick, and you're fuckin' in love.

1093
01:11:10,573 --> 01:11:13,532
算了吧！你愿意失去一切么？
Come on! And you're gonnagive up everything?

1094
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,718
我是这样想的。
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

1095
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:21,291
你和我，我们搬到这附近，买一片葡萄园。
You and me, we move up here,we buy a vineyard.

1096

你设计葡萄酒，我来处理生意方面。
You design the wine.I'll handle the business side.

1097
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:28,036
你得到了灵感，没准儿能写另一部小说，一本有市场的。
You get inspired, maybe writeanother novel, one that can sell.

1098
01:11:28,169 --> 01:11:30,035
哦，上帝啊。不会吧。
Oh, my God. No, no.

1099
01:11:30,169 --> 01:11:32,568
对我来说，如果有试演，洛杉矶就在附近，伙计。
As for me, if an audition comes up,L.A.'s right there, man.

1100
01:11:32,648 --> 01:11:35,127
就两个小时的路，可能还不到。上帝，你疯了。
- It's two hours away. Not even.-Jesus Christ. You're crazy.

1101
01:11:35,235 --> 01:11:37,634
你已经疯了。
You've gone crazy.

1102
01:11:40,647 --> 01:11:43,606
我只知道我是个演员。
All I know is that I'm an actor.

1103
01:11:43,686 --> 01:11:46,325
直觉对我最重要。
All I have is my instinct.

1104
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:50,724
你现在让我违背我的直觉.
You're asking me to go against it.

1105
01:11:50,831 --> 01:11:54,163
嗨，你们好。

You know, it's a thing-- I mean,I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?

1114
01:12:22,344 --> 01:12:25,036

- Mm-hmm.- Stephanie's heard this a thousand times...

1115
01:12:25,117 --> 01:12:28,476
如果我是在圣玛丽长大的，如果我有机会
but if I'd bought up in Santa Mariawhen I had a chance...

1116
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:31,515

He's such a fuckin' chickenshit.

什么都害怕。

1122

这个惹你烦了么？有没有？没关系，没关系。
- Is this bothering you? You sure?- It's fine. Yeah.

1123

[Jack ] What about your agent?You hear anything yet?

1162
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:54,925
没有。你觉得会有什么事？
- [ Miles ] Nope.- What do you think's going on?

1163

不停的查。嗯。

1165
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:03,883
看来我得接受我又浪费了生命中的三年。
Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss offanother three years of my life.

1166
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:06,203
但是你还没有得到任何消息呢...
But you haven't heard anything yet...

1167
01:17:06,336 --> 01:17:09,881
你不觉得你的消极论断还为时过早么？
so don't you think your negativity'sa little premature?

1168
01:17:09,962 --> 01:17:13,881
呒。好的。你知道。操他的纽约出版商。

保持不动。闭嘴。

1174
01:17:34,117 --> 01:17:36,729
保持不动最重要。

01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:40,275
内心的平静。闭嘴，闭嘴，闭嘴！
- Inner quiet.- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

Jesus Christ, man!What the hell is wrong with you?

求求你了，就闭嘴吧！靠！

- but you can choose to be less hostile.- [ Chuckling ]

1181

嘿，这样不好，笨蛋！

好球。笨蛋们。

哦，哦，看，看。

1189
01:18:39,462 --> 01:18:42,741
好戏来了，好戏来了。开过去
- This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.- Go to it.

不要放弃Maya. 像她那样又酷又聪明的女人需要恒心。
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool, smartchicks like that require persistence.

1191
01:18:55,219 --> 01:18:57,698
我不想谈这个了，求你了。
I don't wanna talk about it, please.

1192

她对你非常合适。

1194
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:05,856
如果看不见你们两个在一起我这周不会好过的。
I'm just not gonna feel good about this weekuntil I know you guys have hooked up.

1195
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,695
你难道不想要那种温暖的小盒子加紧你的小弟弟的感觉么？
Don't you want to feel that cozy little boxgrip down on your johnson?

1196
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,655
嘿！往后想想，伙计？
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

1197

当这个女人发现我是怎样生活的...
A woman finds out how I live...

1198
01:19:15,268 --> 01:19:18,627
我并不是一个出版作家，我根本就是个骗子...
that I'm not a published author,that I'm a liar, essentially...

1199
01:19:18,707 --> 01:19:22,252
她所有的兴趣就会很快消失掉。
any interest she hasis gonna evaporate real quick.

1200
01:19:22,386 --> 01:19:26,011
如果你到了我这个年龄还没有钱，就意味着你连游戏的资格都没有了。
If you don't have money at my age,you're not even in the game anymore.

1201
01:19:26,146 --> 01:19:29,691
你只是一个等在abattoir（法语）里的牲畜。

你会成为一个出版作家...

1218
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:34,371
席拉酒。
- [ Miles ] Syrah.- [ All Chattering ]

1219
01:20:34,477 --> 01:20:38,289
圣巴巴拉周围最古老的席拉葡萄。

1220
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:41,515
你知道么？
Did you know that?

1221
01:20:41,649 --> 01:20:43,675
你不知道么？
You didn't know that?

1222
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:48,874
黑皮诺葡萄最早开始种植可能是

01:20:49,008 --> 01:20:52,367
从古代勃艮第。

Why don't you just stayfor the weekend?

Do you have any ideawhat he's been saying to her?

1252

- He's an actor, so it can't be good.- Only that he loves her.

01:28:13,338 --> 01:28:15,230
是的，是的。
Yeah. Yeah.

1285
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:18,589
随便你乱想的就是经过。
Just make up whatever you want,and that's what happened.

1286
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:21,629
把我的同性恋自白书写下来，我会在上面签字的。
Write out my gay confession,and I'll sign it.

1287
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:25,415
好不好？不要老是逼我。
Okay? Just stop pushing meall the time.

1288
01:28:25,495 --> 01:28:27,574
你是个婴儿，Jack.
You're an infant,Jack.

1289
01:28:27,655 --> 01:28:31,014
整个世界对你就是个大派对...好了。
- This is all a big party for you...- Okay.

1290
01:28:31,094 --> 01:28:33,466
但对我不是。行了。
- but not for me.- Come on.

1291
01:28:33,547 --> 01:28:35,493
对不起，伙计。
I'm sorry, man.

1292
01:28:37,013 --> 01:28:39,412
你是不是假装的时候有困难？
Did you have trouble performing?

1293
01:28:41,465 --> 01:28:45,010
是的，就是这个原因。
- Yeah, that's it.- [ Phone Rings ]

1294
01:28:45,144 --> 01:28:48,103
- Don't answer it.- [ Rings ]
- Don't answer it.- [ Rings ]

1295
01:28:48,184 --> 01:28:50,103
不要接。
Don't answer it.

1296
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:53,622
- Jack.- 喂。
- Jack.- Hello.

1297
01:28:53,702 --> 01:28:56,448
是的。
[ Chuckling ]Yeah.

1298
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,848
呃-呃。是Christine。
Uh-huh. [ Whispers ] It's Christine.

1299
01:28:58,981 --> 01:29:03,246
是的，是的。呃-呃。
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1300
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,326
嘿，我回来马上给你打电话。
Hey, let me call you right back.

1301
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,126
Miles和我正有事。
Miles and I are kindain the middle of something.

1302
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:12,738
没有，没什么重要的，就是--他又开始行为反常了。是的。
Nah, it's nothing serious.Just--He's having one ofhis freak-outs. Yeah.

1303
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:16,604
我也爱你。我等下打给你。
- # [ Dance: Woman Singing ]- I love you too. I'll call you back.

1304
01:29:16,737 --> 01:29:20,922
整个星期已经变味儿了。这不是我们本来想要的。
[ Miles ] This whole week has gone sour.It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1305
01:29:21,056 --> 01:29:24,281
我想在只想回家。
I just want to go home.

1306
01:29:25,642 --> 01:29:27,721
我知道你的需要。
I know what you need.

1307
01:29:27,722 --> 01:29:28,415
我知道你的需要。
I know what you need.

1308
01:29:28,521 --> 01:29:31,000
这个怎么样？我们还没有喝过这里的呢。
[Jack ] How 'bout this one?We didn't hit this one.

1309
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:33,640
- Frass Canyon. 笑话吧.你原来来过这里？
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.- You ever actually been in there?

1310
01:29:33,774 --> 01:29:38,039
用不着来这儿。我说我们还是尝尝吧，都已经来了。
- I don't have to.- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1311
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:15,631
它的味道就像他妈洛杉矶校车的屁股。
[ Miles ] It tastes like the backof a fucking L.A. school bus.

1312
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:18,163
嗯，他们可能没有去梗...
Now, they probably didn't de-stem...

1313
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:20,723
想假装酒的浓度很高。
hoping for some semblanceof concentration.

1314
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:23,122
把它和叶子和老鼠一起碾碎...
Crushed it up with leaves and mice...

1315
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:27,042
再配上腐臭的焦油和松脂漱口水这些烂东西。
and then wound up with this rancid tarand turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1316
01:30:27,149 --> 01:30:29,121
他妈的骗人。
Fuckin' Raid.

1317
01:30:30,641 --> 01:30:32,640
我觉得味道挺好。
Tastes pretty good to me.

1318
01:30:32,748 --> 01:30:35,867
嗯。对了。他们有一种保留的皮诺。
Hmm. Look.They have a reserve pinot.

1319
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,746
-我用下你的电话。-怎么了？
- Let me use your phone.- What's up?

1320
01:30:38,826 --> 01:30:42,185
-我不能再等下去了，我要给Evelyn打电话。-好的。
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.- Okay.

1321
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:47,917
Evelyn Berman-Silverman 的办公室.
[ Woman ]Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

1322
01:30:48,024 --> 01:30:51,036
- 嗨, Jennifer. 还是我， Miles.噢，嗨，Miles.
- Hi,Jennifer. It's Miles again.- Oh, hi, Miles.

好的。
Okay.

1325
01:30:55,196 --> 01:30:58,501
你很幸运。我给你接过去。好的。

是你最受宠的客户。
It's your favorite client.[ Chuckles ]

1328
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:08,019
你的旅行怎么样？噢，很好，很好。
- How's the trip?- Oh, it's good, it's good.

1329
01:31:08,153 --> 01:31:10,819
你知道，我们就喝喝酒放松放松。
You know, we're drinkingsome good wines, kicking back.

1330
01:31:10,953 --> 01:31:13,432
非常好。是的.
- It's very nice.- Right.

1331
01:31:13,512 --> 01:31:16,178
怎么样了？还是没有回音，嗯？
So what's happening?There's still no word, huh?

1332
01:31:16,258 --> 01:31:18,257
嗯，事实上，已经有消息了。
Well, actually, there is word.

1333
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:20,870
我早上和Keith Kurtzman通过话了。
I spoke to Keith Kurtzmanthis morning.

1334
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:22,869
嗯。怎么样？
Right. And?

1335
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:25,456
嗯...他们没有通过。
And... they're passing.

1336
01:31:27,136 --> 01:31:31,508
"迷题"出版社没有通过，他说他们很喜欢你的小说。
Conundrum's passing.He said they really liked it.

1337
01:31:31,588 --> 01:31:35,667
他们非常希望能出版它，但是他们不知道怎么推销它。
They really wanted to do it, but they justcouldn't figure out how to market it.

1338
01:31:35,747 --> 01:31:38,813
他说很难有市场。
He said it was a really tough call.

1339
01:31:40,386 --> 01:31:42,305
噢，是的。
Oh. Right.

1340
01:31:42,386 --> 01:31:45,025
很遗憾，Miles。
- I'm sorry, Miles.- [ Sighs ]

1341
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:47,344
我不知道我们还能怎么办。
So I don't know where that leaves us.

1342
01:31:47,425 --> 01:31:51,984
我不知道继续投稿还有多少意义。
I'm not sure how much more mileageI can get out of continuing to submit it.

1343
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:56,222
我想这就是目前出版业不景气的一个不幸的例子吧--
I think it's one of those unfortunate casesin the business right now--

1344
01:31:56,303 --> 01:32:00,328
一本出色的书却找不到归宿。
a-a fabulous book with no home.

1345
01:32:00,462 --> 01:32:03,181
整个出版业都已经没有勇气了。
[ Evelyn's Voice ]The whole industry's gotten gutless.

1346
01:32:03,288 --> 01:32:05,927
并不是说你的书不好。
It's not about the qualityof the books anymore.

1347
01:32:06,061 --> 01:32:08,247
只是市场的问题。
It's only about the marketing.

1348
01:32:12,726 --> 01:32:16,538
-打搅一下，能不能给我， 呃-倒在这里？-当然。
- Excuse me. Could I geta, uh, pour down here, please?- Sure.

1349
01:32:16,618 --> 01:32:20,563
这一点上席拉酒有点特别。
There's a, uh, specialon the Syrah by the case.

1350
01:32:21,817 --> 01:32:23,763
再给我倒上。
Hit me again.

1351
01:32:27,816 --> 01:32:29,762
谢谢。
Thanks.

1352
01:32:31,202 --> 01:32:33,681
对不起，你能不能给我倒满？
Excuse me.Could you just pour me a full glass?

1353
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:35,733
我会付钱的，好不好？
I'll pay for it, okay?

1354
01:32:37,334 --> 01:32:40,719
先生，这里是酿酒园，不是酒吧。
Sir, this is a winery, not a bar.

1355
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,932
噢，得了吧。
Oh. Come on.

1356
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:45,651
就他妈给我满上一杯。
Just give me a full goddamn pour.

1357
01:32:47,358 --> 01:32:49,437
对不起。
Excuse me.

1358
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:53,010
你为什么不买上一瓶，出去喝呢？
Why don't you buy a bottle,then go outside?

1359
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:59,409
-你要干什么？-我给你讲了，我要喝一杯，看来我只好自己动手了。
- What are you doing?- I told you I need a drink,so I'm going to help myself.

1360
01:32:59,489 --> 01:33:01,888
-哼，哥们，你想怎么着？-放下杯子。
- Okay, pal? What do you think?- Put the glass down.

1361
01:33:01,995 --> 01:33:04,474
放下他妈的杯子，操！
Let go of the fucking glass, fucker!

1362
01:33:10,527 --> 01:33:13,166
呒。
- [ Groaning ]- Mmm.

1363
01:33:13,273 --> 01:33:17,565
就这么着。噢，哦，哦，哦，伙计，哦，伙计。
- That's that.- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.

1364
01:33:17,672 --> 01:33:19,644
没关系。把他带出去。
- It's okay.- Get him out ofhere.

1365
01:33:19,751 --> 01:33:23,563
多谢。没关系。他， 呃--他妈妈刚死了。
- Thanks a lot!- It's okay. His, uh-- His mother just died.

1366
01:33:27,563 --> 01:33:30,522
你可以再写一部。你有很多好点子，对吧？
So you'll write another one.You've got lots of ideas, right?

1367
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:33,188
没了，江郎才尽了。我就不是个作家。
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

1368
01:33:33,268 --> 01:33:35,800
我只是个中学英语老师。
I'm a middle school English teacher.

1369
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:39,719
啊，整个世界都不会在乎我想说什么。
Ah, the world doesn't give a shitwhat I have to say.

1370
01:33:39,827 --> 01:33:42,786
我的存在是没必要的。
I'm unnecessary.[ Chuckles ]

1371
01:33:42,866 --> 01:33:46,678
我是那么的不重要，连自杀都不行。
I'm so insignificant,I can't even kill myself.

1372
01:33:46,785 --> 01:33:49,264
Miles, 这到底是什么意思?
Miles, what the hellis that supposed to mean?

1373
01:33:49,345 --> 01:33:51,264
行了，伙计，你知道。
Come on, man. You know.

Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.

1375
01:33:54,624 --> 01:33:57,583
你不能书都没有出版就自杀
You can't kill yourselfbefore you've even been published.

1376
01:34:00,276 --> 01:34:04,061
那写《傻瓜同盟》的那个家伙呢？
- [ Sighs ]- What about the guy that wroteConfederacy Of Dunces?

1377
01:34:04,195 --> 01:34:08,700
他在书出版之前就自杀了。看他现在多出名。
He committed suicide before hewas published. Look how famous he is.

1378
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:12,459
谢谢。

1379
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:19,737
别放弃，好么？你一定会成功的。
Just don't give up. All right?You're gonna make it.

1380
01:34:19,872 --> 01:34:22,378
前半生已经过去了...
Half my life is over...

1381
01:34:22,511 --> 01:34:26,456
我却没什么可展示的，什么都没有。
and I have nothingto show for it, nothing.

1382
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:29,976
我是摩天大楼窗户上的一个指印。
I'm a thumbprinton the window of a skyscraper.

1383
01:34:30,109 --> 01:34:34,054

I'm a smudge of excrementon a tissue...

看到么?这就是。
See? Right there.

1386
01:34:41,227 --> 01:34:43,733
就你刚才说的？就很美
Just what you just said?That is beautiful.

1387
01:34:43,866 --> 01:34:47,465
"一粒粪渣奔向大海"

-是的。-我就永远也写不出来。
- Yeah.- I could never write that.

1389
01:34:50,825 --> 01:34:53,784
我也不行。其实，那时布考斯基写的。
Neither could I, actually.I think it's Bukowski.

1390

嘿，宝贝。
Hey, baby.[ Chuckling ]

我想我们第一天晚上就和他提过了。
I think we mentioned it to himthe first night.

01:57:17,252 --> 01:57:19,251
明白了。
I see.

1660
01:57:20,612 --> 01:57:23,091
嗯，明白了，很好。
Yes, I see. Great.

1661
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:28,130
那，再次恭喜你，Vicki。
Well, congratulations again, Vicki.

1662
01:57:28,237 --> 01:57:31,116
天哪，这可是个好消息。
Boy, that's wonderful news.

1663
01:57:32,876 --> 01:57:35,515
- 那边见, Miles?- 好的.
- See you over there, Miles?- Yeah.

1664
01:59:39,781 --> 01:59:41,700
嗯.
Hmm.

1665
01:59:47,326 --> 01:59:50,898
"他的骨髓，"我漫无目的的重复着。
[ Boy ] "'The marrow ofhis bone, 'I repeated aimlessly.

1666
01:59:51,006 --> 01:59:53,485
这，至少，穿透了我的心灵。
"This, at last, penetrated my mind.

1667
01:59:53,565 --> 01:59:56,604
Phineas已经死了，从他的骨髓中
"Phineas had diedfrom the marrow of his bone...

1668
01:59:56,738 --> 02:00:00,017
鲜血流向他的心脏。
"flowing down his bloodstreamto his heart.

1669
02:00:00,124 --> 02:00:03,403
我并没有哭，也没有为Finny哭。
"I did not cry then or ever about Finny.

1670
02:00:03,483 --> 02:00:06,682
我甚至在葬礼上都没有哭，站在那里...
"I did not cry even when I stood...

1671
02:00:06,816 --> 02:00:10,601
看着他被放进他家波士顿外...
"watching him being lowered intohis family's straitlaced burial ground...

1672
02:00:10,681 --> 02:00:12,600
刻板的家庭墓地里。
"outside of Boston.

1673
02:00:12,681 --> 02:00:16,173
我无法逃脱这种感觉，好像这是我自己的葬礼...
"I could not escape the feelingthat this was my own funeral...

1674
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:19,879
而你是不会在自己的葬礼上哭的。
and you do not cry in that case. "

1675
02:00:19,959 --> 02:00:23,078
我要不要继续读下一章？Raymond先生？
Should I keep readingthe next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

1676
02:00:23,212 --> 02:00:26,997
呃，不用，不用。我们下周一再继续。
Uh, no, no.We'll pick up there Monday.

1677
02:01:14,028 --> 02:01:16,907
您有一条留言。
[ Male Voice, Electronic ]One new message.

1678
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:21,145
你好, Miles. 是 Maya.
[ Maya ]Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

1679
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:23,705
谢谢你的信。
Thanks for your letter.

1680
02:01:23,839 --> 02:01:25,838
我-我应该早点打电话...
I-I would have called sooner...

1681
02:01:25,918 --> 02:01:28,904
但我需要些时间想一想已经发生的一切...
but I think I needed some time to thinkabout everything that happened...

1682
02:01:28,984 --> 02:01:32,476
还有你写给我的东西。
and what you wrote to me.

1683
02:01:32,557 --> 02:01:35,276
还有一个原因，呃，我没有早点打...
Another reason, um,I didn't call you sooner...

1684
02:01:35,356 --> 02:01:38,821
是因为我想读完你的小说，我昨晚终于读完了。
is because I wanted to finish your book,which I finally did last night.

1685
02:01:38,956 --> 02:01:41,942
我真的认为很棒，Miles。
And I think it's really lovely, Miles.

1686
02:01:42,075 --> 02:01:44,554
你用词很娴熟。
You're so good with words.

1687
02:01:44,634 --> 02:01:47,113
谁在乎到底有没有被出版啊？
Who caresif it's not getting published?

1688
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:51,432
里面有很多很美...很伤感的东西。
There are so many beautifuland... painful things about it.

1689
02:01:52,739 --> 02:01:55,511
你真的都经历过么？
Did you really go through all that?

1690
02:01:55,619 --> 02:01:58,231
一定很痛苦。
Must have been awful.

1691
02:01:58,338 --> 02:02:03,296
还有姐姐那个人物--天哪，真是落魄。
And the sister character--geez, what a wreck.

1692
02:02:03,377 --> 02:02:07,856
但是我得说，嗯，结尾让人很迷惑。
But I have to say that, well,I was really confused by the ending.

1693
02:02:07,936 --> 02:02:11,428
我的意思是，那个父亲到底是自杀了还是怎么回事？
I mean, did the fatherfinally commit suicide, or what?

1694
02:02:11,535 --> 02:02:13,507
都让我想疯了。
It's driving me crazy.

1695
02:02:16,068 --> 02:02:18,174
反正...
Anyway...

1696
02:02:18,307 --> 02:02:22,226
这里最近变冷了，经常下雨...
it's turned cold and rainy here lately...

1697
02:02:22,306 --> 02:02:24,945
但是我喜欢冬天。
but I like winter.

1698
02:02:25,052 --> 02:02:29,850
嗯，听着，如果你还想过来的话，你应该告诉我一声。
So, listen, if you ever do decide to comeup here again,you should let me know.

1699
02:02:29,931 --> 02:02:32,730
我是说去我们餐厅，不过说实话...
I would say stop by the restaurant,but to tell you the truth...

1700
02:02:32,864 --> 02:02:35,290
我也不知道我还会在那里工作多久...
I'm not sure how much longerI'm gonna be working there...

1701
02:02:35,423 --> 02:02:37,502
因为我快毕业了.
because I'm going to graduate soon.

1702
02:02:37,609 --> 02:02:40,141
所以可能我会换个地方.
So I'll probably want to relocate.

1703
02:02:40,249 --> 02:02:42,221
我是说，再看吧。.
I mean, we'll see.

1704
02:02:43,688 --> 02:02:47,660
反正，就像我说的，我真的很喜欢的你的小说.
Anyway, like I said,I really loved your novel.

1705
02:02:47,767 --> 02:02:52,645
别放弃，Miles.继续写下去。
Don't give up, Miles.Keep writing.

1706
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:54,726
希望你一切都好。
I hope you're well.

1707
02:02:56,006 --> 02:02:58,005
再见。
