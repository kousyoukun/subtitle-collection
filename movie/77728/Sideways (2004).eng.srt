1
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,300
Fuck!

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,500
- Yeah?
- Miles, can you move your car, please?

3
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
- You didn't park too good. Okay?
- Yeah. All right. Hold on.

5
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,750
Sorry. Sorry, gentlemen.

6
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,000
Sorry.

7
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,100
Oh, fuck me!

8
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,350
I know I said I would be there by noon,

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,300
but there's all of this work
going on at my building,

10
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
and it's just a total nightmare.

11
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,300
And I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning,

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,300
but I'm on my way.

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm out the door right now.

14
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,150
- Hi, Simon.
- Hey, Miles.

15
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,150
- Triple espresso, please.
- For here?

16
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,800
No, actually. I'm running late. Make it to go.

17
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,150
And give me a New York Times
and a spinach croissant.

18
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,850
Thank you.

19
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,800
- Well, hello!
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?

20
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,300
- Come on in.
- Thank you very much.

21
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,100
- Is Jack still here?
- Yes.

22
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,300
- Yes. This way.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Look what the cat dragged.

24
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,700
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.
- Hey!

25
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,700
Somebody finally arrived.

26
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,700
You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.

27
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,700
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?
- Hi. How are you?

28
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,200
We were thinking, maybe, you went
the wrong way, you went to Tijuana...

29
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,200
- Right.
- ...and they don't let you back.

30
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,200
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Daddy!

31
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,200
- Yes, I had to bribe them.
- Hey, Miles.

32
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey. How are you, Christine?

33
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,900
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.
Unbelievable!

34
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
- It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.
- Sure, sure.

35
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,250
People getting an early start
on the weekend, I guess.

36
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,250
Granted, I got a late start, but...

37
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,750
- Well, we're just glad you made it.
- Yes.

38
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,000
Christine, why don't you
ask Miles about the cake?

39
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,250
- Oh, good idea. Here, come with me.
- What's this?

40
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,400
Honey, we don't really have time for that,
'cause we gotta hit the road.

41
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, come on! It's just gonna take a second!

42
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,300
Yeah!

43
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,350
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.

44
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,350
Yes, congratulations.

45
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,200
Yes. Well, it's not exactly finalized yet.

46
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,750
- So, there has been some interest, and...
- Your friend is modest.

47
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,050
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

48
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,350
- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What is the subject of your book?

49
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,700
- Non-fiction?
- No. It's a novel.

50
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,900
- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,700
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life,

52
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,100
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is non-fiction.

53
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Good. I like non-fiction.

54
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,950
There is so much to know about this world.

55
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,450
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
That's an interesting perspective.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,350
- So, which one do you like better?
- Oh, well, I like them both.

58
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,900
But if pressed, I would have to say
that I prefer the dark.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Told you!

60
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,700
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

61
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

62
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,500
Bye.

63
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

64
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,500
We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.

65
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,950
I can't help the traffic.

66
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,700
Oh, come on! You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay, there was a tasting last night, yes.

68
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,450
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,500
Why did you tell them that
my novel was being published?

70
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,200
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

71
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,650
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

72
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,800
Yeah. Conundrum.

73
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,650
And that one of the editors was
passing it up to a senior editor.

74
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,150
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

75
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,150
No. It's a long shot.

76
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,750
And besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.

77
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,750
Anyway, I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

78
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,750
You know? I've stopped caring.

79
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,750
The hell with it. I have stopped caring.

80
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,050
It sounds like it's gonna happen
this time. I mean, I can feel it.

81
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,400
I think this is the one. Huh?

82
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,550
I'm really proud of you, man.

83
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,500
No, don't open that now. No, no, no.

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,650
- Why not?
- It's warm.

85
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,700
- Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
- Right.

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,900
It's really rare. Okay?

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
- I've been saving it.
- All right.

88
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,500
- Please, don't open it!
- I won't open it!

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,550
Jack!

90
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,700
Half of it gone!

91
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,200
Hey, shut up. Okay?

92
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,200
Here's to a great week.

93
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,300
Come on.

94
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,150
Yes. Absolutely.

95
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,300
Despite your crass behavior,

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,450
I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.

97
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,450
Yeah. Me too.

98
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,450
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

99
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,000
I was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.

100
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,550
Man, that's tasty!

101
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,000
That's 100% pinot noir. Single vineyard.

102
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,600
They don't even make it anymore.

103
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,550
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hm.

104
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,550
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh, Jesus!

105
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,550
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

106
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,600
They'll think you're some
kind of dumbshit, okay?

107
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,900
Just tell me.

108
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,900
Color in red wines comes from the skins.

109
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,850
This juice, on the other hand, is free run.

110
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,950
So that there's no skin contact
during fermentation...

111
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,950
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

112
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,950
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- And?

113
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,950
It's great. I mean...

114
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,950
There are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

115
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,350
It just seems... I don't know,
more congealed or something.

116
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,500
Mm-hm.

117
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,900
What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

118
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,550
Oh, yeah! New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

119
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,550
There is no new ending.

120
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,600
Page 750 on is exactly the same.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,150
Well, maybe it just seemed new,

122
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,900
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,950
Yeah, that must be it!

124
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,700
Whoa! Why are we getting off?

125
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,700
- I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,500
I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,700
Your mother?!

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,700
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow, okay?

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.

130
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,300
- Okay.
- It'll take a second.

131
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
She's right off the freeway.

132
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,200
- Okay! I didn't know it was her birthday.
- Thank you.

133
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,000
How old is she gonna be?

134
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,050
70-something.

135
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,150
Oh, hey! Here, hold these for just a second.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

137
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,500
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

138
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,300
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

139
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,750
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!

140
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,000
What a surprise!

141
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,200
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

142
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,500
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- They're from both of us.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,100
- A famous actor bringing me flowers...
- Right!

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,000
- ...for my birthday!
- Yeah!

145
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,400
- Don't I feel special?
- And champagne!

146
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,200
Famous actor's getting married
next week, Mom.

147
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,950
Oh, that's right!

148
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,950
Isn't that nice?

149
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,350
I hope that girl knows how lucky she is

150
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,700
marrying no less than Derek Sommersby.

151
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Gosh, that was, like, 11 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

152
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, you were wonderful in that show!

153
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,850
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

154
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, now, Miles,

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,550
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

156
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,550
Look how I'm dressed!

157
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,050
I've gotta run and put my face on.

158
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,400
- You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
- Oh, stop it!

159
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,650
Make yourselves comfortable.

160
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,650
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

161
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,600
Just a snack.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,100
<i>To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.</i>

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

164
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,800
They're just leftovers.

165
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,800
Is this chicken?

166
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,800
I could have made something fancier,

167
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,800
if a certain someone had let me
know that a certain someone

168
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,850
was coming for a visit and
bringing a certain special friend.

169
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,400
It was a surprise, Mom.

170
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,200
And I could've already put clean sheets
on the other bed and the foldout.

171
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,000
You are staying.

172
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,000
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up
at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

173
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,500
They do a magnificent job there.

174
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,550
- You talked to Wendy?
- Just now.

175
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,100
She's thrilled! And the twins...

176
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.

177
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,650
Well, you know, Jack is
pretty eager to get up to...

178
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,850
You know.

179
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,100
But, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.

180
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,100
Well, you boys do what you want.

181
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,900
I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.

182
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll be right back.

183
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,600
And what was that other one you did?

184
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,900
The one where you were the jogger.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, that was for... Spray 'n Wash.

186
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Spray 'n Wash! That's the one!

187
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,200
Gosh! I remember the girl that was
in it with me. She was something.

188
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,200
I just remember you jogging.

189
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,200
So, when's the wedding?

190
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,000
Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.

191
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,350
And Miles is my best man,
Mrs. Raymond. My main man.

192
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,350
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?

193
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,800
I just got divorced, Phyllis.

194
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,950
Two years ago, buddy.

195
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,300
You should get back together with Victoria.

196
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,100
She was good for you.

197
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,000
She was good for you!

198
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,700
And so beautiful, and so intelligent.

199
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,450
You knew her, right?

200
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,350
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

201
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,850
I'm worried about you, Miles.

202
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,400
Do you need some money?

203
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,950
Jack.

204
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,400
Jack.

205
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,450
Jack, come on.

206
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,650
<i>A rubber bag food slinger?</i>

207
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,650
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

208
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,650
<i>Our super-amazing tree house</i>

209
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,650
<i>brought about by our 2x4 technology...</i>

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,900
Jack! No, no, no, no. She'll wake up.

211
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,900
<i>Who did this?</i>

212
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,900
<i>- I did!
- What?</i>

213
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,900
<i>She was tired, silly.</i>

214
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,900
<i>Our ship was so high!</i>

215
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,900
<i>They need a vacation!</i>

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,500
<i>Hamster holiday! Fun for all!</i>

217
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.
You know what I mean?

218
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,850
Oh! She's a kid, for God's sake.

219
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,850
As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us in the first place.

220
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,450
Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks
looking at me all the time, all ages.

221
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,450
Dudes too.

222
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,350
Well, it's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.

223
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,750
- It's never free.
- You need to get laid, Miles.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,900
You know what? That's gonna be
my best-man gift to you this week.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm gonna get you laid.

226
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Wonderful.

227
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,650
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate
or a penknife or any of that other horseshit.

228
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,850
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.

229
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,800
You've been officially depressed
for, like, two years now.

230
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,650
And you're a negative guy anyway,
even back in college.

231
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,400
- Mm-hm.
- And now it's worse.

232
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,050
You're wasting away. Teaching
English to fucking 8th-graders?

233
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,950
When they oughta be reading
what you wrote.

234
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,050
- Mm-hm.
- Your books, Miles.

235
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,950
- I'm working on it.
- Not working hard enough.

236
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,450
- Are you still seeing that shrink?
- I saw him on Monday.

237
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,400
I spent most of the time
helping him with his computer.

238
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,100
Well, I say fuck therapy.
And what is that stuff you take, Xanax?

239
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,500
- And Lexapro, yes.
- Well, I say fuck that too.

240
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.

241
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,650
Okay, Jack... Jack...

242
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,200
This week is not about me. It is about you.

243
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,250
I'm gonna show you a good time.

244
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,750
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf,

245
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,500
we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery,

246
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,200
and we're gonna send you off
in style, mon frère.

247
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,100
And get your bone smooched.

248
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,800
You know what?

249
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,100
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first, okay?

250
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,650
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

251
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,500
These guys make top-notch
pinot and chardonnay.

252
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,900
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

253
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,200
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

254
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,900
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.

255
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,700
Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.

256
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,850
Huh!

257
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,850
You see, the reason that
this region is so good for pinot,

258
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,300
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night

259
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,900
and it just cools down the berries.

260
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,850
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

261
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,450
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

262
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,900
Let me show you how this is done.

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,450
First thing, hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

264
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,600
You're looking for color and clarity.

265
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,200
- Just get a sense of it, okay?
- Okay.

266
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,350
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

267
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,300
- Okay?
- Okay.

268
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,300
Now tip it.

269
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,000
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

270
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,900
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,900
It's usually more important with reds.

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
- Okay?
- Okay.

273
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,900
Now stick your nose in it.

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
- Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

275
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,750
Really get your nose right in there. Really...

276
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
A little citrus.

277
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,550
Maybe some strawberry.

278
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,000
Passion fruit.

279
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,400
And... Oh, there's just, like, the faintest...

280
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,050
soupçon of, like, asparagus and...

281
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,150
There's just a flutter of, like, a...

282
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,050
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

283
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,150
Wow!

284
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
- Strawberries, yeah.
- Good.

285
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
- Strawberries.
- Yeah.

286
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
- Not the cheese.
- All right.

287
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,300
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

288
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,700
Oxygenating it opens it up.

289
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,200
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

290
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,600
Smell again.

291
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,600
That's what you do with every one of 'em.

292
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,200
- Wow! When do we drink it?
- Now.

293
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,550
How would you rate this one, Miles?

294
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,100
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities,

295
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,500
but this one is pretty damn good.

296
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,300
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
- Just released about two months ago.

297
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,300
- Nice job.
- We like it.

298
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,650
You could work in a wine store, Miles.

299
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,700
Yeah, that'd be a good move.

300
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,500
Are you chewing gum?

301
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,450
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

302
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,450
Whoa!

303
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,000
Do you think I'm doing the right thing,
Miles? Tell me the truth.

304
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,400
I mean, you've been there.

305
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,400
Well, you know, I think that you
waited for some good reason,

306
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,400
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason.

307
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,900
So, I think it's great.

308
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,900
It's time.

309
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,950
I mean, you gotta have
your eyes open, that's all.

310
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,950
I mean, look at me. You know,
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

311
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,950
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me about

312
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,950
bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

313
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,950
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

314
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,950
So, I'm thinking about it.

315
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,950
But I don't know.

316
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,950
Might get a little incestuous.

317
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,950
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

318
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,450
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way!

319
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,300
No. This would just provide some stability.

320
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,050
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

321
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,050
Keep myself in the game in case something
really great came along, you know?

322
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,050
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

323
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,750
No, no.

324
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,900
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,900
- Miles!
- Sir.

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,700
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

327
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,000
Hey, when's your novel coming out?

328
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,900
- We all wanna read it.
- Oh, soon, soon, soon.

329
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,100
Say, this is my buddy Jack.
He's getting married next week.

330
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,700
- Oh, my condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

331
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,950
- We have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hm?

332
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,700
We have the new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

333
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,950
Absolument.

334
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,950
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

335
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,000
Very special. Thank you.

336
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,600
So, what do you think?

337
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,550
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

338
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,000
Pour us a couple, will ya?

339
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,250
Yeah. It's tight.

340
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,800
There you are, gentlemen.

341
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,900
I will leave you the bottle,
and it is good to see you.

342
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,550
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

343
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,550
It's gonna be great.

344
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,650
Here's to us.

345
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,050
- Miles.
- Mm-hm?

346
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,000
Check out that chick.

347
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,300
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.

348
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,300
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

349
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
- You know that chick?
- Yes.

350
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,200
Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

351
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
You know, it's practically my office.

352
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,300
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

353
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,300
Maya's great. She's worked here,
like, a year, year and a half.

354
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,300
She's incredibly hot.

355
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,650
Yes, she is. And nice. And married.

356
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
Check out the rock.

357
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,600
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

358
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,300
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku,

359
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,900
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

361
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Well, this gal is married to, like, some

362
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,500
philosophy professor
at U.C. Santa Barbara.

363
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,200
What's a professor's wife doing
waitressing? Obviously that's over.

364
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,950
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

365
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,200
Calm down. Let's just eat.

366
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,100
Oh, hey, Miles!

367
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,700
- Oh! Hi, Maya.
- Good to see you.

368
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,500
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

369
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,250
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

370
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,950
No, actually.

371
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,850
But... thank you.

372
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,400
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

373
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,400
You guys been out tasting?

374
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,700
Oh, you know it. You know it.

375
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,850
This is my friend, Jack. Jack, Maya.

376
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,900
- Hiya.
- Hi.

377
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,600
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

378
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,150
Oh! Back to work.

379
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,250
- Jesus, she is jamming!
- Yeah.

380
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,250
And she's obviously into you.

381
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,250
What else do you know about her?

382
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,500
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

383
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,550
Now we're getting somewhere.

384
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,550
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

385
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,100
She's a fucking waitress in Buellton, Jack.

386
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,100
How is that ever gonna work out?

387
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,500
You dick! Why do you have
to focus on the negative?

388
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,350
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

389
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,050
You're blind, dude. Blind.

390
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,100
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

391
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,000
Hey, Gary.

392
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,250
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

393
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,250
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

394
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,250
Oh, hey, guys. Do you mind?

395
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,000
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

396
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,500
Please. Light up, light up.

397
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,300
In fact, would you like to join us?

398
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,500
Sure.

399
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,700
So, how's that book coming, Miles?

400
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,750
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

401
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,000
I finished it.

402
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,150
Good for you! Wow!

403
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,150
It's getting published.

404
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,550
That's actually why
we're up here celebrating.

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,800
Oh, congratulations! That's fantastic!

406
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,000
- All right.
- Yeah.

407
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,000
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

408
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,350
Are you a writer too?

409
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,350
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

410
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,850
Really! What kind of stuff?

411
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,850
A lot ofTV.

412
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,350
I used to be a regular on a couple of series.

413
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,050
But lately it's been a lot of
commercial work. Nationals, mostly.

414
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,050
Anything I might know?

415
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,700
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

416
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Now with a low, low 5.8% A.P.R. financing!

417
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,100
That's hilarious!

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,100
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

419
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,100
- You are not!
- He is.

420
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

421
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,400
Side effects may include oily discharge,

422
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,400
hives, loss of appetite, low blood pressure.

423
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,400
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble,

424
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,550
you're dead, asshole!

425
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,800
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

426
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,050
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

427
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,200
you know, I think we're just gonna
go back to the motel and crash.

428
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,250
Yeah, I guess it's kind of
a long drive up here.

429
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,350
Where are you staying?

430
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
The Windmill.

431
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,450
Windmill.

432
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,100
The girl is looking to party,

433
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,400
and you tell her we're going
back to the motel and crash?

434
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,400
- Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired, Jack.

435
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,900
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

436
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,900
She lit up like a pinball machine,

437
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,400
when she found out your novel
was getting published.

438
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,900
Now I have another lie to live down.

439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,700
- Thanks,Jack.
- Just trying to get you a little action.

440
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

441
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,900
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,400
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

443
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,450
And, by the way, I was right.
She's not married.

444
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,550
- How do you know?
- No rock.

445
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,300
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

446
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,250
What's the plan for today, Miles?

447
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,250
A-ha!

448
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,950
Good. We head up north.

449
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,950
Begin the grape tour up there.

450
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,950
Work our way south.

451
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,950
So that the more we drink,

452
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,100
the closer we get to the motel.

453
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,450
What's your problem?

454
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,150
What is it?

455
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,350
I'm going to get my nut on this trip, Miles,

456
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,350
and you are not gonna fuck it up for me

457
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,100
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.

458
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,150
Well, now the cards are on the table.

459
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,150
Yes, they are.

460
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,750
And I am serious.
Do not fuck with me, Miles.

461
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,550
I am going to get laid before I get
married on Saturday. Do you read me?

462
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,950
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

463
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,950
Loud and clear. Whatever you say.

464
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,400
It's your party, evidently.

465
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,250
Why don't you just...

466
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,300
Yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

467
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,300
No, Miles!

468
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,850
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

469
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,850
We should both be cutting loose.

470
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,800
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

471
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,600
It's something we should share.

472
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,150
This is our Syrah.

473
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,500
Okay.

474
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,600
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

475
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,550
That's a big one.

476
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,100
But it did sit with the skins for about
two weeks in an open-topped tank.

477
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,600
- Okay. So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

478
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,100
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

479
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,150
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

480
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,800
Fill up there, bub.

481
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,450
This is our estate chardonnay.

482
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:21,600
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

483
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,400
Stephanie.

484
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,700
Stephanie. Nice.

485
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,450
So, what do you think?

486
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,450
Quaffable.

487
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,800
But far from transcendent.

488
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,800
I like it. Tastes great.

489
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,800
Oak-y.

490
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,750
This is a cabernet franc.

491
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,750
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

492
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,400
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

493
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,400
It's from our vineyards up in Santa Maria,

494
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,200
and it was a silver medal winner

495
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,400
at Paso Robles last year.

496
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,200
Well, I will tell you something.

497
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
I've come never to expect
greatness from a cab franc,

498
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
and this one is no different.

499
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,600
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe--

500
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,100
I don't know. Tastes pretty good to me.

501
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,550
So, do you live around here, Stephanie?

502
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,200
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

503
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,700
We're just over in Buellton.

504
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,600
The Windmill Inn.

505
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh, yeah?

506
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,300
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya...

507
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,700
- ...that works at The Hitching Post?
- Yeah, sure.

508
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,900
- Yeah, I know Maya.
- Yeah?

509
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,500
- No shit?
- I know her real well, yeah.

510
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,200
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

511
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,350
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

512
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,350
Oh! Champing at the bit, huh?

513
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,450
Sure.

514
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,350
This is our estate Syrah.

515
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,400
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

516
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,500
I know. I need to be spanked.

517
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,750
Excuse me.

518
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
The Syrah?

519
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,900
Hey, hey. Get the trunk.

520
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,700
- You have the keys.
- I do?

521
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

522
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,900
- So, we're on.
- What?

523
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,500
Yeah. She called Maya,
who's not working tonight.

524
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,050
So we're all going out.

525
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,050
- With Maya?
- Yeah.

526
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,550
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.

527
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,550
This chick Stephanie?

528
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,550
She's got it all going on.

529
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,600
Well, she is cute, yeah.

530
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,600
Cute? She's a fucking hottie.

531
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,800
And you almost tell her
that I'm getting married?

532
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,550
What's the matter with you?

533
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,400
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

534
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,650
Yeah. Victoria and I used to like this view.

535
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,600
You know, once we had a picnic here

536
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,200
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

537
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,800
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

538
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,600
Oh, man! She has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

539
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,600
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

540
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.

541
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

542
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

543
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

544
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,800
She got remarried.

545
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,850
She what?

546
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,450
When?

547
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,100
About a month ago.

548
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,100
Maybe six weeks.

549
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,000
To that guy, the guy with the restaurant?

550
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,300
Miles?

551
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,350
Miles.

552
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,750
I'd like to go home now.

553
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,750
Miles, get out of the car.

554
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,300
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

555
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,300
You know--

556
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
She's bringing him to the wedding?

557
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
What do you think?

558
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,900
Why didn't you tell me
about this before, Jack?

559
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,900
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

560
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,900
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

561
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,300
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party, man.

562
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.
Persona non grata.

563
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,600
Everybody's just gonna be holding
their breath, waiting to see...

564
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,900
if I get drunk and make a scene.

565
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,700
No, no. No, look...

566
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,100
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

567
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,100
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

568
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,100
She's cool. Everybody's cool.

569
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,650
I'm sorry. You've been talking...?

570
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,750
Behind my back,
you've been talking about it?!

571
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,350
What are you doing?

572
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,600
Come back here.

573
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
Miles!

574
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,700
- Come here. Give me that bottle.
- Back off, Jack.

575
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,750
- Come on.
- Back off, man!

576
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,900
- Give me that bottle.
- No.

577
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,700
Miles.

578
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,850
Miles!

579
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,900
<i>You got a dream. There's a lot of people
out there that think they can make it.</i>

580
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,900
<i>You know, what better thing in life is to chase
the dream and not be afraid of going after it?</i>

581
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,400
<i>James Lepp next to play.
Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.</i>

582
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm gonna go for a swim,
get the blood flowing.

583
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,300
You wanna come?

584
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,950
No, I wanna watch this.

585
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,500
Okay.

586
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,050
<i>Should start this ball
one or two inches outside the left edge.</i>

587
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,300
<i>Go in!</i>

588
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,800
<i>- Great putt.
- Absolutely. Great speed.</i>

589
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,000
Miles.

590
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,000
Miles.

591
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,350
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.

592
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,000
This fucking chick in the Jacuzzi!

593
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,700
Oh, dude!

594
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,000
This place is wide open.
I'm going fucking nuts up here, man.

595
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,850
- Hey, what should I wear?
- I don't know.

596
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,900
Something casual, but nice.
They think you're a writer.

597
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,100
Right. Okay.

598
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,700
Do you have any other shoes?

599
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,650
Uh-uh.

600
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,650
Hey, honey.

601
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,150
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.

602
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,600
Miles and I are getting ready to go
to dinner. Probably stay out late.

603
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,000
So I just thought I'd call
and say good night now.

604
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,300
Yeah. I miss you too.

605
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah. I love you too.

606
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,300
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self, okay?

607
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,300
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

608
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,300
People love that guy.

609
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,000
And don't forget,
your novel is coming out in the fall.

610
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,300
Oh, really? How exciting! What's it called?

611
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Come here, Miles. Come here.

612
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,850
Do not sabotage me.

613
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,600
If you wanna be a fucking lightweight,
then that's your call.

614
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,900
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

615
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
- And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinking merlot. - Oh, no.

616
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,200
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

617
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,900
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

618
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,900
Jesus! No merlot.

619
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,100
Did you bring your Xanax?

620
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,700
All right.

621
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,500
Come here.

622
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,300
Do not drink too much. Do you hear me?

623
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,200
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

624
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,300
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

625
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,300
Hi. Just looking for some friends.

626
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
Good evening, ladies. How are you?

627
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,700
- Hi, Miles.
- Good. How are you?

628
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,000
Hello, Maya.

629
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,250
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- Thank you.

630
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,000
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

631
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,000
So, what's good here?

632
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,600
What is this that you're drinking?

633
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,500
Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

634
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,000
A-ha, I see. Is it good?

635
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,400
- Try it.
- So, what time do you close up at...

636
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,700
- At Kal... Is it?
- Kalyra.

637
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,000
- Kalyra.
- Kalyra.

638
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,550
I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.

639
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,550
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I...

640
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,000
- That's nice. That's really nice.
- It's aged 12 months in oak.

641
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
- French oak.
- Really?

642
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
- Sauvignon blanc?
- Mm-hm.

643
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,200
Huh! Interesting. It's good.

644
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,350
I know the winemaker. She comes
into the restaurant all the time.

645
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,550
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

646
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,850
You know, clean up and put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

647
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
- Right.
- Just... small stuff.

648
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,000
- Hints of clove. Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

649
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,300
Yeah.

650
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,000
- Sorry. It's good.
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.

651
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,700
Now we're thinking! Good. Okay.

652
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,700
Oh, that's raw!

653
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,550
Oh, oh! He can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

654
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,550
I didn't hear him say that.

655
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,500
Whenever I say something he said!

656
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,050
Very good.

657
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,550
No, actually, no. That one. Not this one.

658
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,950
I'm having that too.

659
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,250
- Right?
- Oh, yes!

660
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,950
That's what I'm saying.

661
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,050
We have corn chowder,

662
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,450
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles

663
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,600
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

664
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,600
And finally...

665
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,000
- I have to explain my credentials.
- Yes!

666
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,050
Miles, what does this remind you of?

667
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,450
He was brought up on a lot of charges.

668
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,450
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

669
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,000
Right.

670
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,450
After all, tonight we are celebrating
Miles's book deal.

671
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,450
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

672
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,150
Wow, Miles!

673
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,400
- Ohh!
- Well, in that case...

674
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,850
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

675
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,100
Ancient way of treating the grape.

676
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,000
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

677
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,700
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way of dealing with wine.

678
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,450
So, everyone's going back to that.

679
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,500
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

680
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,800
- It's not a... It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hm.

681
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,800
Your lips look soft.

682
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,850
- The whole area is...
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

683
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,900
What do they call the...

684
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,500
Malibu-- It's Malibu Canyon.

685
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,650
I don't know what the hell I'm trying to say.

686
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
<i>Hello?</i>

687
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,300
Victoria?

688
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>Miles?</i>

689
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,450
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria! How the hell are ya?

690
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,600
<i>What... What's on your mind?</i>

691
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,600
Oh, nothing...

692
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,900
Just heard that you got remarried.

693
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,200
Congratulations. I...

694
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,200
Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.

695
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,200
<i>Oh, Miles, you're drunk.</i>

696
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,500
Oh, just a little local pinot.

697
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,500
You know, a little burgundy.
That old Cotes de Beaune.

698
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,350
<i>Where are you?</i>

699
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,750
A little place in Los Olivos.

700
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,750
New owners. Cozy ambience.

701
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,050
Excellent food too.
You should... you should try it.

702
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,450
I thought of you at the
Hitching Post last night.

703
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,000
Hello?

704
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,000
<i>Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.</i>

705
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,400
No, it's... All right, I just...
I wanted to let you know

706
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,400
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding.

707
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,000
So, just in case you were dreading
some sort of, you know,

708
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,100
run-in or something like that,
well, you worry no more,

709
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,000
because I'm not gonna be there.

710
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,750
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

711
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,100
What is his name?

712
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,800
<i>Ken.</i>

713
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Ken! Right.

714
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,500
Ken.

715
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,300
<i>I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.</i>

716
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,700
No. You know, it's just, I heard about this

717
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,450
for the first time today.

718
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,450
Your getting remarried, that is.

719
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,000
And... I was kind of taken aback.

720
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,150
Just... hard to believe.

721
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,200
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance

722
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,200
for us somewhere down the road.

723
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,700
And I just...

724
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,700
- <i>Miles.</i>
- Huh?

725
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,700
Maybe it is better,
if you don't come to the wedding.

726
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,400
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.

727
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,450
You're the boss.

728
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,000
Huh? I don't know.

729
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,150
Welcome back.

730
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,200
Take it easy.

731
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,000
Are you okay, Miles?

732
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,000
Yes. I'm fine. Thank you.

733
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Excuse us, gentlemen.

734
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Excuse us.

735
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,000
Sure.

736
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,400
All right.

737
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,900
Don't take too long.

738
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,400
Okay. Bye, girls.

739
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,100
What the fuck?! What is up with you?

740
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,100
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah.

741
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,200
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

742
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,950
Where were you?

743
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,000
Bathroom.

744
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,050
Did you drink and dial?

745
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,850
Hmm?

746
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,250
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

747
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,700
Victoria is gone. Gone.

748
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,200
Poof! In the wind.

749
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,700
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.

750
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,400
Maya, Fuckin' Maya! She's great!

751
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,400
She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.

752
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,850
I mean, what is this morose,
come-down bullshit?

753
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,350
These girls wanna party with us.

754
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,000
Huh?

755
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,000
And what was that 10-minute lecture
on Vouvrays?

756
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,400
Are you kidding me? Who gives a fuck?

757
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,950
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

758
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,700
Have you forgotten all the bad times
you had with Victoria?

759
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,550
How small she could make you feel?

760
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,600
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?

761
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,600
Shut up! Shut your face. Shut up!

762
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,750
Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?

763
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,800
Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.

764
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,200
Reel her in. Let's ratchet this up a notch.

765
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,050
Here. Drink some agua fria.

766
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,100
- Hey.
- Hey.

767
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,600
Hey!

768
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,250
Well, so, shall we get some dessert?

769
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,250
Well, we were thinking...
why don't we go back to my place?

770
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,400
I've got wine, some insane cheeses,
music, whatever.

771
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,100
Yeah!

772
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Waiter!

773
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,500
Come here.

774
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,850
One for you, three for me.

775
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,000
You sure you wanna do this?

776
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,500
- We're here!
- Hey!

777
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,950
- Hey!
- Where were you guys?

778
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,250
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.

779
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,400
- Oh, Miles.
- Yeah?

781
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,400
- Maya's in the back, just past the kitchen.
- Okay.

782
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,400
Thanks.

783
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,350
Hi.

784
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,500
Hey.

785
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,350
- Oh, she got anything good?
- Oh, yeah.

786
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,300
Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.

787
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,300
- Hey, Steph!
- Yeah?

788
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,200
- Can we really open anything we want?
- Yeah, yeah. Anything.

789
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,650
Except the Richebourg.

790
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,200
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel!

791
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,200
I've completely underestimated Stephanie.

792
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,550
Oh, good Lord! Look at that.

793
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,850
I think... this guy's more our speed.

794
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,850
Andrew Murray.

795
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,350
Well, okay. All right.

796
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,900
So, what gems do you have
in your collection?

797
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,100
Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.

798
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,100
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.

799
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,150
No, I've never really had the wallet for that.

800
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,650
I just have to live bottle to bottle.

801
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,000
I've got things I'm saving, definitely.

802
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,400
I guess the star would be
a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

803
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,650
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,
and it's just sitting there?

804
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,650
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.

805
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,500
- Okay.
- I'm serious! Hurry!

806
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,000
All right. I would, I would.

807
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,100
I mean, I think the '61s are peaking
right now, aren't they?

808
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,500
At least that's what I've read.

809
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,300
No, that's right, yeah.

810
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,200
It might be too late already.
What are you waiting for?

811
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,750
Oh, I don't know.
A special occasion with the right person.

812
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,000
It was supposed to be for
my 10th wedding anniversary, but...

813
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,550
You know, the day you open
a '61 Cheval Blanc,

814
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,600
that's the special occasion.

815
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,050
So, how long have you been into wine?

816
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,000
I got serious about seven years ago.

817
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,450
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- '88 Sassicaia.

818
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:12,850
Well, congratulations.

819
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,850
- Yeah.
- That's very good.

820
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,250
- Well...
- That would do it. Yeah.

821
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,100
Oh, wow, that's nice. That's very good.

822
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,900
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.

823
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,100
How about you?

824
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,000
I think they overdid it a little.

825
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,350
Too much alcohol. It overwhelms the fruit.

826
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,450
Huh!

827
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,450
Yeah. Yeah.

828
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,950
I'd say you're right on the money.

829
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,450
Very good. Nice.

830
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,000
Thank you.

831
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,850
Is that Stephanie's kid?

832
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,850
Oh, yeah. That's Siena.

833
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,750
- Oh, she's a sweetie.
- Cute. Cute.

834
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,750
Where is she?

835
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,750
She's at her grandmother's.

836
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,050
Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.

837
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,050
You got kids?

838
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,100
Me? No. No.

839
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,000
No, I'd just fuck 'em up.

840
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,250
No, that was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce, no kids.

841
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,250
Yeah. Same here.

842
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,250
Good.

843
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,350
Let's go in there.

844
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:33,500
<i>Now, for a low, low 4.8% A.P.R. financing...</i>

845
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,500
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

846
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,100
Yeah, I would say that.

847
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,700
So, what's your novel about?

848
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,700
What's my... Oh, brother!

849
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,200
Well, it's difficult to summarize.

850
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,200
It starts out as a kind of
a first-person narrative

851
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,550
about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.

852
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,200
And it's kind of based
on personal experience.

853
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,900
But only loosely.

854
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,200
What's the title?

855
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,500
The Day After Yesterday.

856
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,450
Oh. You mean today.

857
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,050
Yeah. I mean, right. But it's more--

858
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,800
So it's about, like, death and mortality, or...

859
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah!

860
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,450
Not really.

861
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,000
It... jumps around a lot.

862
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,400
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

863
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,400
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.

864
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,900
And a lot of other things happen,
parallel narratives.

865
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,900
It's kind of a mess.

866
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,900
And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves...

867
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,900
or devolves...

868
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,300
into this sort of Robbe-Grillet mystery.

869
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,300
You know?

870
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,400
But no real resolution.

871
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Wow!

872
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,950
Well, I think it's really great
you're getting it published.

873
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,050
Really. I mean, I know how hard it is
just to write it, even.

874
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,050
Yeah.

875
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,800
I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday,

876
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,300
and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.

877
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,450
- A paper, huh?
- Yeah.

878
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,500
I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.

879
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,950
Sort of chipping away on it.

880
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,700
Horticulture? Really?!

881
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,850
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.

882
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,350
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.

883
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,950
Horticulture? Wow!

884
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,050
So, do you want to work
in a winery or something?

885
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,700
Maybe.

886
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
So, when can I read your book?

887
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,450
Well... You know... Well, I do happen
to have a manuscript in my car.

888
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,350
I mean, it's not proofed or anything,

889
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,700
so it's full of typos.

890
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,350
- If you don't mind typos.
- Oh, no. Who cares?

891
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,400
I mean, I'm the queen of typos.

892
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,450
Okay.

893
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:51,050
You know, can I ask you
a personal question, Miles?

894
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,050
Sure.

895
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,050
Why are you so into pinot?

896
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:58,350
I mean, it's like a thing with you.

897
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,200
I don't know. I don't know.

898
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,550
It's a hard grape to grow.

899
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,800
As you know, right?

900
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,200
It's thin-skinned,

901
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,050
temperamental, ripens early.

902
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,700
You know, it's not a survivor like cabernet.

903
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,100
Which can just grow anywhere

904
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,100
and thrive even when it's neglected.

905
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,950
No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?

906
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,450
And, in fact, it can only grow

907
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:34,450
in these really specific, little
tucked-away corners of the world.

908
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,500
And only...

909
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:43,500
the most patient and nurturing of growers

910
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,150
can do it, really.

911
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:49,250
Only somebody who really takes the time

912
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,200
to understand pinot's potential

913
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,200
can then coax it into its fullest expression.

914
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,650
And then? I mean...

915
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,850
Oh, its flavors, they're just
the most haunting and brilliant

916
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,550
and thrilling and subtle and...

917
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,600
ancient on the planet.

918
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:18,500
No, I mean, you know, cabernets
can be powerful and exalting too,

919
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:22,200
but they seem prosaic to me,
for some reason, by comparison.

920
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,600
I don't know. I don't know.

921
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,600
What about you?

922
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,600
What about me?

923
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,050
I don't know. Why are you into wine?

924
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,550
Oh, I think I...

925
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,050
I originally got into wine
through my ex-husband.

926
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,050
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

927
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,900
- You know?
- Right.

928
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,850
But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.

929
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,850
And the more I drank,

930
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,900
the more I liked
what it made me think about.

931
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,900
Like what?

932
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,900
Like what a fraud he was.

933
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,850
No, I mean, I like to think
about the life of wine.

934
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,600
Yeah.

935
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,900
How it's a living thing.

936
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,550
I like to think about...

937
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,050
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing,

938
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,450
how the sun was shining,

939
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,500
if it rained.

940
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,300
I like to think about...

941
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,100
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes.

942
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:31,700
And, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.

943
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,400
I like how wine continues to evolve.

944
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,700
Like, if I opened a bottle of wine today,

945
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,550
it would taste different than
if I'd opened it on any other day.

946
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,100
Because a bottle of wine is actually alive.

947
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,150
And it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

948
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,250
That is, until it peaks.

949
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,250
Like your '61.

950
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,800
And then it begins its steady...

951
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,800
inevitable decline.

952
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,700
And it tastes so fucking good.

953
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,450
Yeah.

954
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,100
But you know, I...

955
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,650
I like other wines besides pinot too.

956
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,450
I mean, lately I've been really into Rieslings.

957
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,750
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?

958
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,600
Mm-hm.

959
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,100
There's a bathroom in the back?

960
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,850
- Yeah. Through the kitchen.
- I'll be right back.

961
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,000
God, you are such a fucking loser.

962
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,200
You make me so fucking sick.

963
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:17,450
Oh, God! Come on.

964
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,500
Hey.

965
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,550
- I was just getting some water.
- Okay.

966
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,650
- You want some water?
- No.

967
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,350
Okay. It's getting kind of late.

968
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,700
I should really go.

969
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,400
So you know how to get to the Windmill?
Two rights and a left.

970
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,500
- Got it.
- Okay.

971
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,100
I had a nice time tonight, Miles. I really did.

972
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,050
Good. So did I.

973
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,000
Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.

974
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,150
Did you still want to read my novel?

975
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh, yeah. Of course.

976
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,800
Yeah.

977
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,850
- Great.
- Just a second.

978
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,000
- Here.
- Oh, wow!

979
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,050
Well, I hope you like it.

980
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:12,900
And feel free to stop reading it any time.
I will not be offended.

981
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,150
Okay.

982
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,900
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.

983
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,050
Oh, fuck.

984
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,200
Oh, fuck.

985
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:42,350
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.
Unbelievable!

986
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,150
Ohh! She is nasty, Miles.

987
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:51,350
Nasty, nasty, nasty!

988
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,600
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
- Yeah, baby.

989
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,000
Congratulations. Mission accomplished.

990
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,650
Oh, hi, Miles!

991
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,000
Hi.

992
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,500
Hey, you didn't invite Stephanie
to come with us, did you?

993
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,100
Oh, listen, man. Change of plans.
Stephanie's off today.

994
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,300
So, you know, I'm thinking
about going on a hike.

995
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,000
We were supposed to play golf.

996
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,100
You know what? You go, man. You go.
In fact, use my clubs. They're brand-new.

997
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,700
They were a gift from Christine's dad.

998
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,400
Here, I'll pay for it. Right there.

999
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,900
And then later, the three of us,
we can go to The Hitching Post.

1000
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,700
We could sit at one of Maya's tables.

1001
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,700
She'll bring us some great wine, you know?

1002
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,500
- And then the four of us will do something.
- No. Count me out.

1003
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,200
Oh, I see.

1004
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,000
Didn't go so great last night, huh?
What a shocker.

1005
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,500
You mean getting drunk and calling
Victoria didn't put you in the mood?

1006
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,000
Dumb fuck!

1007
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
Later, man.

1008
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah, well, maybe you should
check your messages first.

1009
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,850
Oh, boy!

1010
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,650
Yeah, she's been leaving
messages here too.

1011
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah. Okay.

1012
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,200
- You should call her.
- I will. I'll see you.

1013
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,000
- Right now!
- Okay. Fuck!

1014
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,000
- What are you, my mom?
- Well...

1015
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
Would you mind waiting outside?

1016
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah. Good food.

1017
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,350
Hey, I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.

1018
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,400
You should call her.

1019
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,500
- Where's Jack?
- Had to make a phone call.

1020
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,700
Miles. Miles.

1021
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,500
Hey, man... Do you have that other condom?

1022
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,500
In my jacket.

1023
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,900
What did Christine say?

1024
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Lucked out. Got voice mail.
Everything's cool.

1025
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,650
- Here I am.
- Hi!

1026
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,000
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1027
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,000
Cannonball!

1028
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,500
<i>Please dial your password and press pound.</i>

1029
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,500
<i>You have no messages at this time.</i>

1030
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,000
<i>To send a message, press 2.</i>

1031
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Not now. Not now!

1032
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,500
Yeah.

1033
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,350
Hey, there you are.

1034
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,900
- Yup.
- Hey, man.

1035
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,800
What are you drinking?

1036
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,350
Is it any good?

1037
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,800
Can I get a glass, please?

1038
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,000
Thanks.

1039
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:48,150
Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

1040
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,000
God, it was so awesome.

1041
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,000
I think I'm really starting to get
a handle on the whole process.

1042
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,300
You know, the soil to the vine,
and the... What do you call it?

1043
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,600
...the selection to the harvest.

1044
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,700
And then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it?

1045
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,100
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1046
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,850
Then we ate pinot grapes right off the vine.

1047
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,000
They were a little sour,

1048
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,900
but showing excellent potential for structure

1049
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,900
down the line, I think.

1050
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,100
Stephanie, man.
She really knows her shit.

1051
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,700
Where is Stephanie?

1052
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,300
She's upstairs cleaning up.

1053
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,800
What the fuck are you doing?

1054
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,500
What?

1055
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
With this chick.

1056
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,000
What?

1057
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,850
Does she know about Saturday?

1058
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,400
Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

1059
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,200
I haven't told her I'm available.

1060
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,050
And she knows this trip
is only for a few days.

1061
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,800
Besides, I just...

1062
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,150
- Besides what?
- Well, you know...

1063
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,200
- The wedding.
- What?

1064
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:57,200
I've just been doing some thinking about it.

1065
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,100
Oh, you've been thinking. And?

1066
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:06,900
Might have to put
the wedding on hold, is all.

1067
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:10,500
Look, I know that that could be tricky

1068
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,650
for certain people to accept at first.

1069
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,200
All right? But life is short, Miles.

1070
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,200
I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

1071
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,600
And you know what?
That's not just for my sake.

1072
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,500
I'm looking out for Christine's feelings too.

1073
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,050
I mean, being with Stephanie
has completely opened my eyes.

1074
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:32,950
She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

1075
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,400
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

1076
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,400
- She fucks different.
- Okay.

1077
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
She fucks like an animal.

1078
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I gotta tell you, man.

1079
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,200
I went deep last night.

1080
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:49,550
Deep.

1081
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:52,400
Deep.

1082
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,900
I thought I'd get a little understanding from you,
but I guess I'm not gonna get that.

1083
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,550
Understanding about what,Jack?

1084
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,000
I might be in love with another woman.

1085
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,350
In love? Really?

1086
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:10,400
24 hours with some wine-pourer chick,
and you're fucking in love.

1087
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
Come on! And you're gonna
give up everything?

1088
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,700
Here's what I'm thinking.

1089
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,100
You and me, we move up here,
we buy a vineyard.

1090
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,800
You design the wine.
I'll handle the business side.

1091
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,000
You get inspired, maybe write
another novel, one that can sell.

1092
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,500
- Oh, my God! No, no, no.
- As for me,

1093
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,900
if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s right there, man.

1094
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,100
- It's two hours away.
- Jesus Christ!

1095
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,000
- Not even.
- You're crazy.

1096
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,600
You've gone crazy.

1097
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,200
All I know is that I'm an actor.

1098
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:46,300
All I have is my instinct.

1099
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,400
You're asking me to go against it.

1100
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,000
Hi, guys!

1101
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Hi. Hi.

1102
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:00,000
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

1103
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,250
Where?

1104
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:05,350
I know all the drivers.

1105
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:09,750
Huh? All right, here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice.

1106
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:12,800
Nice. Okay, it's the bridge.

1107
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,700
Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.

1108
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,200
You know, it's a thing... I mean,
I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?

1109
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,000
Stephanie's heard this a thousand times,

1110
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,400
but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance,

1111
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,450
I would've made a fortune
when they put in that...

1112
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,400
- Home Depot.
- Home Depot.

1113
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,600
And those stores.
And your father knew about it too.

1114
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,600
He's such a fucking chickenshit.

1115
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:42,400
Always was. Just a fucking chickenshit.

1116
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,850
Just too scared.

1117
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:47,900
- Is this bothering you? You sure?
- No, it's fine. Yeah.

1118
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,600
Hey, man. I'm gonna just make sure
that Siena and Stephanie get home safe.

1119
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,700
- Okay.
- All right.

1120
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,200
- Maybe we'll hook up with you later.
- Sure. Whatever.

1121
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,400
Maybe I'll go catch a movie or something.

1122
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,400
- See you later, Miles.
- Thanks, Stephanie. See you.

1123
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,200
- Bye, Siena.
- Bye.

1124
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,300
Caryl, very nice meeting you.

1125
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,200
- Oh, I loved talking with you.
- Thanks.

1126
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,000
If you go out later, call me on my cell.

1127
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,900
Okay!

1128
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,150
- Okay. That's it?
- Yeah.

1129
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,050
Oh, actually, could I get
a Barely Legal, please?

1130
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,700
Thank you. No, actually.
Sorry. The new one.

1131
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,700
Okay.

1132
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:39,300
Thanks.

1133
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:53,900
- Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?
- Hey.

1134
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,100
Oh, you know me. I love it up here.

1135
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,200
- How about you?
- Busy for a Tuesday night.

1136
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,000
We had a busload of old folks
on a wine tour.

1137
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,100
Usually they're not too rowdy,
but tonight something's going on.

1138
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,150
I don't know. A full moon or something.
Anyway, what can I get you?

1139
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,000
- Highliner.
- Glass or bottle?

1140
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:15,300
- Bottle.
- You got it.

1141
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,700
Say, is Maya working?

1142
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,100
Maya? No, I haven't seen her.

1143
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,500
I think she's off tonight.

1144
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,500
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1145
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,500
Crap!

1146
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:21,500
- Did you ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
- Nope.

1147
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,000
- Hmm?
- No.

1148
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,650
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie will tell you.

1149
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,000
Could you just give me a little room?

1150
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,400
- Yeah
- Please, Jack. Thank you.

1151
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,950
In life, you gotta strike
while the iron's hot. Iron is hot.

1152
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:37,400
Sage advice, Jack.

1153
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,550
Now, remember, sit back on your heels.

1154
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:43,800
All right? Turn through the abdomen.

1155
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,500
Abdomen.

1156
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:49,300
- Oh, for crying...
- Nice.

1157
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,900
What about your agent?
Did you hear anything yet?

1158
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,900
- Nope.
- What do you think's going on?

1159
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
- Could be anything.
- You been checking your messages?

1160
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,750
- Obsessively.
- Huh.

1161
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,900
Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss off
another three years of my life.

1162
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,200
But you haven't heard anything yet,

1163
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,850
so don't you think your negativity's
a little premature?

1164
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,850
All right. You know, fuck
the New York publishers.

1165
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:16,300
Publish it yourself, Miles. I'll chip in.

1166
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,350
Just get it out there. Get it reviewed.

1167
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:22,750
Get it in libraries. Let the public decide.

1168
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,700
Don't come over the top.

1169
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,000
- Stay still.
- Shut up.

1170
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,700
It's all about stillness.

1171
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,250
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1172
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:43,000
Jesus Christ, man!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1173
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,000
Please, just shut up! Fuck!

1174
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,400
- God!
- What's with the hostility, man?

1175
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,700
I know you're a little frustrated
with your life right now,

1176
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,700
but you can choose to be less hostile.

1177
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:02,150
The fucker hit into us.

1178
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,950
Hurry it up, will ya?

1179
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:08,400
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1180
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,000
Hey, that's not cool, asshole!

1181
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,100
Nice shot. Jackoffs.

1182
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:31,350
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oops. Look out.

1183
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,600
Uh? Uh-huh.

1184
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,350
Oh. Oh, check it out.

1185
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:42,750
- This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.
- Go to it.

1186
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:54,900
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool, smart
chicks like that require persistence.

1187
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,500
I don't wanna talk about it, please.

1188
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,200
All I know is that she's beautiful,
a lot of soul.

1189
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,300
She's perfect for you.

1190
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,650
I'm just not gonna feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

1191
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:09,500
I mean, don't you want to feel that cozy
little box grip down on your johnson?

1192
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,450
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

1193
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:14,950
A woman finds out how I live,

1194
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,400
that I'm not a published author,
that I'm a liar, essentially,

1195
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,050
any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.

1196
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,800
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not even in the game anymore.

1197
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,500
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

1198
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,550
- Abattoir. What is that?
- Slaughterhouse.

1199
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,700
Abattoir. Huh. But you know what?

1200
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
You are gonna be a published author,

1201
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,100
because you're gonna get the good news
this week about your book.

1202
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:45,800
I know you are. I can feel it.

1203
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,850
Huh. Stephanie.

1204
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,700
Hey, honey. Yeah.

1205
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,250
Yeah. Yeah.

1206
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:55,250
Yeah!

1207
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:01,950
- Hey.
- Hi.

1208
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,650
Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped by
the restaurant to see me last night.

1209
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,100
Oh, yeah. No. I mean, yeah.

1210
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,800
I mean, I stopped by for a drink.
I didn't see you.

1211
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:17,800
- I had class.
- Oh.

1212
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,550
Well, nice to see you now.

1213
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,650
It's good to see you too.

1214
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,150
Syrah.

1215
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:38,050
Oldest Syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.

1216
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,350
Did you know that?

1217
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:43,450
You didn't know that?

1218
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,700
The pinot noir grape
has been cultivated perhaps

1219
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,150
since antiquity in Burgundy.

1220
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,950
And it is precisely this ancient

1221
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,300
and inherited winemaking knowledge

1222
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,000
that has contributed to its success.

1223
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,700
- I was, like, 16, 17.
- Really?

1224
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,900
Yeah. I'm gonna die!

1225
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,450
- Oh, God. What a drag.
- Mom?

1226
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,450
- Oh.
- Oh, hey. Hi.

1227
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,000
Is it too loud?

1228
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:20,250
Sorry. Oh, Uncle Jack
will put you back to bed, okay?

1229
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:22,350
Come here, little sister. Ooh!

1230
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:25,400
We'll be more quiet, okay?

1231
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,450
- Good night. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1232
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:32,950
My favorite, as far as ice cream...

1233
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:36,050
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey!

1235
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:02,900
You guys should come by
the restaurant for lunch today.

1236
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,450
- Great. What's the latest we can get there?
- About 2:30.

1237
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Hey, did you hear about this
Bordeaux tasting dinner 

1238
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,400
down in Santa Barbara on Saturday night?

1239
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,600
It's kind of pricey,
but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.

1240
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,200
Why don't you just stay for the weekend?

1241
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,500
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

1242
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,550
What rehearsal dinner?

1243
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,850
Who's getting married?

1244
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:34,100
- Were you ever gonna say anything?
- Yes, of course I was.

1245
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,700
Just now I could've told you
some story, but I didn't.

1246
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,650
- I told you the truth. Maya!
- Don't touch me!

1247
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,750
Just take me home.

1248
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,850
Do you have any idea
what he's been saying to her?

1249
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:50,650
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

1250
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,200
How she's the only woman
that's ever rocked his world.

1250
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,900
How he adores Siena.

1251
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,600
How he wants to move here
and get a place with the two of them

1251
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,300
and commute when he has to.

1252
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,150
I'm sure he believed every word of it.

1253
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:04,600
Please believe me.

1254
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,600
I was on the verge
of telling you last night, but--

1255
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,800
But you wanted to fuck me first.

1256
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,750
Oh, Maya. No.

1257
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:16,750
Yeah.

1258
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:31,450
You know, I've just spent
the last three years of my life

1259
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,850
trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception.

1260
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:37,900
And I'm doing just fine.

1261
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,400
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce.

1262
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:47,500
So this has been a big deal for me, Maya.

1263
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,850
Hanging out with you and... last night.

1264
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:55,300
I really like you, Maya.

1265
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,850
And I am not Jack.

1266
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:01,950
I'm...

1267
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:06,250
I'm his freshman year roommate
from San Diego State.

1268
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:34,300
There's my boy!

1269
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,350
There he is!
But who's your daddy?

1270
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,250
- Who is your daddy?
- Jack, come on.

1271
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:42,950
- Let me love you.
- Let go.

1272
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,850
Let me down, Jack.

1273
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,500
I am so proud of you.

1274
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,600
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. All right, all right. Details.

1275
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:54,650
- I love details.
- No.

1276
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:58,600
- What?
- Jesus. It's private.

1277
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,850
You better tell me what happened,
or I'll tie your dick in a knot.

1278
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:05,250
Let's just leave it, okay?

1279
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:09,000
You didn't get any, did you?

1280
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:13,050
- You're a homo.
- Yeah, right. Yup, I'm a homo.

1281
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,900
Yeah. Yeah.

1282
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,400
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened. Okay?

1283
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,450
Write out my gay confession, and I'll sign it.

1284
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,250
Okay? Just stop pushing me all the time.

1285
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:27,400
You're an infant, Jack.

1286
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,850
- This is all a big party for you...
- Okay.

1287
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:33,300
- ...but not for me.
- Come on.

1288
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,350
I'm sorry, man.

1289
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:39,250
Did you have trouble performing?

1290
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,850
Yeah, that's it.

1291
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:47,500
Don't answer it.

1292
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,950
Don't answer it.

1293
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:53,450
- Jack.
- Hello.

1294
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:56,300
Yeah.

1295
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,700
Uh-huh. It's Christine.

1296
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,100
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1297
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,200
Hey, let me call you right back.

1298
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:07,950
Miles and I are kinda
in the middle of something.

1299
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:12,550
Nah, it's nothing serious. Just...
He's having one of his freak-outs. Yeah.

1300
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,450
I love you too. I'll call you back.

1301
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:20,800
This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1302
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,100
I just want to go home.

1303
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,500
I know what you need.

1305
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:30,850
How about this one?
We didn't hit this one.

1306
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:33,500
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

1307
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,900
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1308
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:15,450
It tastes like the back of
a fucking L.A. school bus.

1309
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,000
Now, they probably didn't de-stem

1310
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,550
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

1311
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,600
Crushed it up with leaves and mice,

1312
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:26,900
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1313
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,950
Fucking Raid.

1314
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,450
Tastes pretty good to me.

1315
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,700
Look! They have a reserve pinot.

1316
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,600
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

1317
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:42,000
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.
- Okay.

1318
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,750
<i>Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.</i>

1319
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,850
- Hi, Jennifer. It's Miles again.
- <i>Oh, hi, Miles.</i>

1320
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,850
- Hi.
- <i>Let me see if I can get her.</i>

1321
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,950
Okay.

1322
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:58,350
- <i>You're in luck. I'll put you through.</i>
- Okay.

1323
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:03,150
- <i>Hi, Miles.</i>
- Hi, Evelyn.

1324
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,150
It's your favorite client.

1325
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,850
- <i>How's the trip?</i>
- Oh, it's good, it's good.

1326
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,700
You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

1327
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,250
- It's very nice.
- <i>Right.</i>

1328
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,000
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

1329
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,100
<i>Well, actually, there is word.</i>

1330
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,700
<i>I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.</i>

1331
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,700
Right. And?

1332
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,300
<i>And... they're passing.</i>

1333
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,350
<i>Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.</i>

1334
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:35,500
<i>They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.</i>

1335
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,650
<i>He said it was a really tough call.</i>

1336
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,150
Oh, right.

1337
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:44,850
<i>I'm sorry, Miles.</i>

1338
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,200
<i>So I don't know where that leaves us.</i>

1339
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:51,850
<i>I mean, I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.</i>

1340
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:56,050
<i>I think it's one of those unfortunate cases
in the business right now.</i>

1341
01:31:56,150 --> 01:32:00,200
<i>A fabulous book with no home.</i>

1342
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,000
<i>The whole industry's gotten gutless.</i>

1343
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,400
<i>It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.</i>

1344
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
<i>It's only about the marketing.</i>

1345
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:16,350
- Excuse me. Could I get a pour
down here, please? - Sure.

1346
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:20,400
There's a special on the Syrah by the case.

1347
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:23,600
Hit me again.

1348
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:29,600
Thanks.

1349
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,500
Excuse me.
Could you just pour me a full glass?

1350
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
I'll pay for it, okay?

1351
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:40,550
Sir, this is a winery, not a bar.

1352
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:42,800
Oh. Come on.

1353
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,500
Just give me a full goddamn pour.

1354
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,300
Excuse me.

1355
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,850
Why don't you buy a bottle,
then go outside?

1356
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,300
What are you doing?

1356
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,250
I told you I need a drink,
so I'm going to help myself.

1357
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:01,750
- Okay, pal? What do you think?
- Put the glass down.

1358
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:04,300
- Let go of the fucking glass, fucker!
- Put the glass down.

1360
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:14,300
How's that?

1360
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,400
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.

1361
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,500
- It's okay.
- Get him out of here!

1362
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,600
- Thanks a lot!
- It's okay.

1362
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,400
His mother just died.

1363
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,500
So you'll write another one.
You've got lots of ideas, right?

1364
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,050
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

1365
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:35,650
I'm a middle school English teacher.

1366
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,600
The world doesn't give a shit
what I have to say.

1367
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,000
I'm unnecessary.

1368
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:46,550
I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.

1369
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:49,100
Miles, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1370
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,100
Come on, man. You know.

1371
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,400
Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.

1372
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,450
You can't kill yourself
before you've even been published.

1373
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:03,950
What about the guy that wrote
Confederacy Of Dunces?

1374
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,550
He committed suicide before he was
published. Look how famous he is.

1375
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,300
Thanks.

1376
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,600
Just don't give up. All right?
You're gonna make it.

1377
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,250
Half my life is over,

1378
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:26,300
and I have nothing to show for it. Nothing.

1379
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,850
I'm a thumbprint on the window
of a skyscraper.

1380
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:33,900
I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue

1381
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:38,150
surging out to sea
with a million tons of raw sewage.

1382
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,950
See? Right there.

1383
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,600
Just what you just said?
That is beautiful.

1384
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:47,350
"A smudge of excrement surging out to sea."

1385
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:50,550
- Yeah.
- I could never write that.

1386
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,650
Neither could I, actually.
I think it's Bukowski.

1387
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,500
Hey, baby.

1388
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:26,200
- Look what I got for our favorite girl.
- Motherfucker!

1389
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:30,950
- Jesus Christ!
- You fucking lying piece of shit!

1390
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:35,150
You're getting married on Saturday?
What's with all that shit you said to me?

1391
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,700
- Stephanie, stop!
- I can explain!

1392
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,450
- You said you loved me!
- I do!

1393
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:43,700
- I hope you die!
- Stop it, Stephanie!

1394
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,300
Fuckface! You too!

1395
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:56,900
Me?

1396
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,950
- You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
- No, I did not.

1397
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,050
No, I did not.

1398
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:06,550
It must have been Gary
at The Hitching Post.

1399
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:09,150
I think we mentioned it to him the first night.

1400
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:12,800
Oh, did he mention it?
You mentioned it, asshole!

1401
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,500
I'm fucking hurting over here.

1402
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,600
Keep it elevated.

1403
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,400
No, I don't want anything.

1404
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,300
It's Miles.

1405
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:38,400
I had to call and tell you again

1406
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,800
how much I enjoyed our time together

1407
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,850
and... how sorry I am

1408
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:46,900
that things turned out the way they did.

1409
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:52,300
I think you're great, Maya.

1410
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,350
I always have from the first time
that you waited on me.

1411
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:02,200
And while I'm at it...

1412
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,900
I guess maybe you should know that

1413
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,350
my book is not getting published.

1414
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:13,400
I thought this one had a chance,
but I was wrong again.

1415
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:17,300
Once again.

1416
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:20,200
So you see...

1417
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:23,450
I'm not really much of a writer.

1418
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,500
I am not much of anything, really.

1419
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:42,400
I'm gonna have to have an operation,
maybe even a couple of'em.

1420
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,800
They're gonna wait for my nose to heal first,
and then they break it again.

1421
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:49,100
Oh, Christ! Good thing
you have a voice-over career.

1422
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:52,900
It's gonna fuck that up too.
I ought to sue her ass.

1423
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:55,500
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.

1424
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:57,850
- That's thoughtful.
- Yeah.

1425
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,550
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?

1426
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:06,950
We didn't get into that with Gary.

1427
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,050
Huh. That's... Yeah, let me think.

1428
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:16,800
- You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
- Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.

1429
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,900
And just what are you implying, Jack?

1430
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,700
Actually, I'm really pissed off at you
about all this, if you want to know the truth.

1431
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:27,850
What is Maya going to think of me now,
just for associating with you?

1432
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:34,900
I don't know. Sure seems fishy.

1433
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:37,050
Well...

1434
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:41,650
<i>Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat,</i>

1435
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,900
<i>I'll be there.</i>

1436
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,200
<i>Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy,</i>

1437
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,150
<i>I'll be there.</i>

1438
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:53,700
<i>I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.</i>

1439
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,800
What's this look like to you?

1440
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,750
It looks like you were
in a bad car accident actually.

1441
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:06,050
<i>When the people are eating
the stuff they raised...</i>

1442
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,600
I'm hungry.

1443
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:14,800
Here we go.

1444
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,850
- Nice.
- Thanks.

1445
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:21,450
- And here is your Handi Wipes.
- Oh!

1446
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:26,150
So that's what those are. For a minute
I thought you guys were promoting safe sex.

1447
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:29,200
That's a good one.
I'll have to remember that one.

1448
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,500
- I'll be right back with your corn bread.
- All righty.

1449
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,550
Bet you that chick's two tons of fun.

1450
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:41,300
You know, the grateful type?

1451
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,750
I don't know. I wouldn't know about that.

1453
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,600
Here you go.

1454
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:56,900
Nice technique there... Cammi.

1455
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,100
Thank you. All in the wrist.

1456
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,000
You know, you look really familiar to me.

1457
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:06,350
- Are you from around here?
- Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?

1458
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:09,950
I don't know. You just seemed
really familiar to me.

1459
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:13,300
- Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
- Hang on. Hang on.

1460
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:17,150
Did you ever know
a Derek Sommersby?

1461
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:21,700
Dr. Derek Sommersby
from 'One Life to Live'?

1462
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:27,350
Just have to imagine him with,
you know, a bandage and shorter hair.

1463
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:33,500
No way!

1464
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:36,700
No way! Oh, my gosh!

1465
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,900
That's great! Oh, my goodness!

1466
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,300
Could you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

1467
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:47,050
Oh, yeah. It's right over there,
right past the buffalo. Wow!

1468
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:51,150
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
you're sitting at my table.

1469
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:19,900
Listen, man, Cammi gets off
in an hour, so I was thinking

1470
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I'd just hang around, have a drink.

1471
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:26,200
You know, make sure she gets home safe.

1472
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,650
You're joking, right?

1473
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,250
No.

1474
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,300
Un-fucking-believable!

1475
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:39,800
Can't we just go back to the motel
and hang out,

1476
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:43,000
get up early, play nine holes of golf,

1477
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,050
before we head home?

1478
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:51,950
Listen, man, you're my friend,

1479
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:55,000
and I know you care about me.

1480
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,750
And I know you disapprove
and I respect that.

1481
01:41:57,850 --> 01:42:02,550
But there are some things that I have
to do that you don't understand.

1482
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:07,450
You understand literature, movies, wine...

1483
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:10,000
but you don't understand my plight.

1484
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,100
Yeah?

1485
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:35,550
- Holy shit! Jesus Christ!
- Fuck. Fuck.

1486
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,900
God, it's fucking freezing out there!

1487
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
- God, yeah!
- Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin?

1490
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,600
Here.

1492
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,700
Fucking chick's married, man.

1493
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,700
What?

1494
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:04,400
Her husband works the night shift
or something, and he comes home,

1495
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:06,600
and catches me on the floor
with my cock in his wife's ass.

1496
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:10,700
Oh, Jesus Christ! Jesus, Jack!

1497
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,150
- And you walked all the way from Solvang?
- No, ran.

1498
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:16,200
Twisted my ankle too.

1499
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:19,500
- That's five klicks, Jack!
- Fucking-A right, it's five klicks.

1500
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,700
At one point I had to cut
through an ostrich farm.

1501
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,700
Those fuckers are mean.

1503
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,500
We gotta go back.

1504
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,450
What?

1505
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:46,750
We gotta go back. I left my wallet.

1506
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:48,850
Credit cards, cash, my fucking I.D.

1507
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:51,400
- Everything. We gotta go back.
- Big deal. It's fine.

1508
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,700
Don't worry about it. We'll call now
and we'll cancel your cards.

1509
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,650
No, Miles, you don't understand.
The wedding rings.

1510
01:43:57,750 --> 01:43:59,650
The wedding rings are in my wallet.

1511
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:04,700
Okay. Fine, they're in your wallet, and you left
your wallet somewhere, in some bar, okay?

1512
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,400
- Christine will understand.
- She had to order them special.

1513
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,000
It took her forever to find them.

1514
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:13,650
They've got this design of dolphins
and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

1515
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,300
We gotta go back, man.
Christine will fucking crucify me, Miles.

1516
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:19,450
No way, no way, no way.

1517
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:21,550
Please! Please!

1518
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:24,950
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen in some bar.

1519
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:28,000
- It happens every day.
- No, we gotta go back and get my wallet, Miles.

1520
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:31,500
I'm telling you, those rings are irreplaceable.

1521
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,000
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.

1522
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,100
- But you've gotta help me.
- Yeah.

1523
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:40,750
You've gotta help me, Miles.
Please! Please!

1524
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:43,200
I can't lose Christine, Miles.

1525
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,950
I just... I can't. I can't lose Christine.

1526
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:48,250
I know I fucked up.

1527
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:52,250
I know I did a bad thing, all right?
And I know I'm a bad person.

1528
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:56,800
I know I am. But you gotta help me.
You have to help me, Miles.

1529
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:00,350
Okay? Tell me you'll help me.

1530
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:03,250
If I lose Christine...

1531
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:05,400
I'm nothing.

1532
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:08,950
I just have... I'm nothing.

1533
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:11,100
God!

1534
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,650
- Did she tell you she was married?
- Yeah.

1535
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,600
So what the fuck were you thinking?

1536
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:19,100
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6:00.
Fucker rolls in at 5:00.

1537
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:22,000
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

1538
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,900
- This is the block.
- You sure?

1539
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Yeah.

1540
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,300
- That's it. That's it.
- Yeah?

1541
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,350
- That's the one right there.
- Okay.

1542
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:36,550
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1543
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:38,650
Okay.

1544
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:46,150
All right. Okay, so what's the plan?

1545
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,500
The plan is...

1546
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,750
you go.

1547
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,950
- Me?!
- 'Cause of my ankle.

1548
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:57,000
Still hurts. Just go explain the situation, Miles.

1549
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,700
Explain the situation. Yes.

1550
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:04,100
"Excuse me, sir. My friend was the one
balling your wife a couple of hours ago.

1551
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,300
"Really sorry. He seems to
have left his wallet behind.

1552
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,400
"I was wondering if I could come in
and just poke around. I don't know."

1553
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,600
- Yeah, yeah, just like that. That's good.
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

1554
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:20,350
Oh, fuck it! I'll go!
I guess I have to do everything.

1555
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:23,900
No. Hold on.

1556
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,950
You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now.

1557
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:16,200
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl!

1558
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:18,800
You picked him up and you fucked him,
didn't you, bitch?

1559
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:22,600
Yeah, I picked him up and I fucked him.
I'm a bad girl!

1560
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,350
You liked fucking him,
didn't you, you little whore?

1561
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:29,650
I liked it when you caught me fucking him!
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!

1562
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,650
- You are a bad bitch.
- Yeah!

1563
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:34,200
- Yeah, you caught me.
- You're such a whore.

1564
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,650
Oh, yeah!

1565
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,550
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, it's so good!

1566
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,600
I fucked him.

1567
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:46,950
- You're so bad.
- I am. Yeah.

1568
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,800
You are such a whore.

1569
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:57,400
- What the fuck?!
- The wallet! He's got Derek's wallet!

1570
01:48:57,550 --> 01:49:00,450
<i>I think they were surprised
by the level of protest</i>

1571
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:03,250
<i>that was really happening
within the company.</i>

1572
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:08,300
<i>The injustice may be their plan,
and they said, "Well, we can't just go..."</i>

1573
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,300
- Here's your wallet! Oh, shit!
- Motherfucker!

1574
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,900
Open the goddamn door!

1575
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,950
- You got it! You got my wallet!
- I'm gonna kill your ass!

1576
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:21,850
I'll find you! I will find you, bub!
I'll find your ass!

1577
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:25,100
You're mine, man! You're mine!

1578
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,800
Fuck you! I'm gonna get your ass!

1579
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:03,200
- You wanna let me drive?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

1580
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:07,050
Hey, you know, you ought to
invite Maya to the wedding.

1582
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:11,950
Somehow I think inviting
Maya to the wedding

1583
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:15,100
is not the right move at this juncture.

1584
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,100
I don't know.

1585
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,150
You know, in fact,
after all of your shenanigans,

1586
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:22,300
it's gonna be hard for me to ever go
to The Hitching Post again.

1587
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,350
You know, there was a nice way
to respond to that.

1588
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,950
- Come on. Let me drive.
- No, I got it. You should rest.

1589
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,900
You know what? I feel like driving.

1590
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,900
Okay.

1591
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,200
Hey, put on your seat belt, okay?

1592
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,600
I was just about to. What's the problem?

1593
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:41,700
Just want to remind you to be safe.

1593
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,200
- Jack, we missed the entrance.
- Yeah.

1594
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:47,100
What are you doing, Jack?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1595
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,700
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hang on.

1595
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,500
What the hell are you doing? Jack!

1597
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,900
What the fuck!

1598
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,200
- You said it looked like an accident.
- What the fuck!

1599
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:58,850
I'll pay for it.

1600
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:03,900
Jesus! Christ, Jack!
Oh, for cry... Look at this!

1602
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:09,450
I don't know.

1603
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:13,300
Doesn't look like anyone
was injured in this one.

1604
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,300
No. No.

1605
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:18,000
- Watch your head.
- Yeah.

1606
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:21,300
Boy, you broke a couple of them, you know.

1607
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:24,400
- Whatever. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not "whatever".

1608
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:27,100
You fucking derelict!

1609
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:29,100
You ready?

1610
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,300
Just get it over with.

1611
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:17,350
Okey-doke. All right.

1612
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,250
Well, I guess that's about it.

1613
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,000
Want to come inside?

1613
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:25,300
No. No, you're on your own.

1614
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:29,050
All right. Well, I guess
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

1615
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,500
Yup.

1616
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,100
- I love you, man.
- Yeah. Back at ya.

1618
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:41,700
- Miles, don't drive away until they see the car.
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

1619
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,650
Hey, hey, wait a second. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?

1620
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,200
'Cause you were wearing your seat belt.

1621
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:52,650
Nicely done.

1622
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:15,300
- Hi.
- Jack!

1623
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:18,200
- Yeah.
- Christine, Mike!

1625
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:33,350
Hey, Miles.

1626
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:37,950
Hi, Vicki. Wow, you look beautiful!

1627
01:55:38,050 --> 01:55:39,950
Thanks.

1628
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:42,750
This is Ken Cortland, my husband.

1629
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:44,750
- How are you?
- How are you?

1630
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:46,850
- Good, thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.

1631
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:50,350
- You're a lucky guy.
- Yes, I am. Thank you.

1632
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:52,500
Yeah.

1633
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:55,200
Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.

1634
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:58,300
- It was great meeting you, Miles.
- Ken.

1635
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:05,950
- Well, that was big of him.
- Yeah, he's good that way.

1636
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:09,950
- He's very considerate.
- That's great.

1637
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:12,450
So how are you doing?

1638
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,350
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know.

1639
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:18,750
Could be better. Could be worse.

1640
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:23,350
- So what's happening with your book?
- Universally rejected.

1641
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:27,600
- Strike three.
- Oh, Miles, that's awful.

1642
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:30,400
What are you gonna do?

1643
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:33,750
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not.

1644
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:36,500
I don't know.

1645
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,550
So, anyway, you're married.

1646
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:42,900
Congratulations. You look happy.

1647
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,400
- I am.
- Good.

1648
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:48,250
Seems like everybody's getting married.

1649
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:52,250
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.

1650
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:55,500
- Cyclical, I guess.
- I guess.

1651
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:04,000
Well, what do you say we hit the reception?

1652
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:07,000
Have some champagne,
toast the newlyweds, huh?

1653
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:09,000
Not me. I'm not drinking.

1654
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:13,200
You quit drinking. Really?

1655
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:15,300
I'm pregnant.

1656
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:19,200
I see.

1657
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:23,050
Yes, I see. Great.

1658
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:28,100
Well, congratulations again, Vicki.

1659
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,100
Boy, that's wonderful news.

1660
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:35,450
- See you over there, Miles?
- Yeah.

1662
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:50,900
"'The marrow of his bone',
I repeated aimlessly.

1663
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,450
"This, at last, penetrated my mind.

1664
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:56,600
"Phineas had died
from the marrow of his bone

1665
01:59:56,700 --> 02:00:00,000
"flowing down his bloodstream to his heart.

1666
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:03,350
"I did not cry then or ever about Finny.

1667
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:06,650
"I did not cry, even when I stood

1668
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:10,550
"watching him being lowered into
his family's straitlaced burial ground

1669
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:12,600
"outside of Boston.

1670
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:16,150
"I could not escape the feeling
that this was my own funeral,

1671
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:19,850
"and you do not cry in that case."

1672
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:23,100
Should I keep reading
the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

1673
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:27,000
No, no. We'll pick up there Monday.

1674
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,300
<i>One new message.</i>

1675
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,150
<i>Hello, Miles. It's Maya.</i>

1676
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,700
<i>Thanks for your letter.</i>

1677
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:25,800
<i>I would have called sooner,</i>

1678
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,900
<i>but I think I needed some time to think
about everything that happened</i>

1679
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,200
<i>and what you wrote to me.</i>

1680
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:35,250
<i>Another reason I didn't call you sooner</i>

1681
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:38,800
<i>is because I wanted to finish your book,
which I finally did last night.</i>

1682
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:41,950
<i>And I think it's really lovely, Miles.</i>

1683
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:44,500
<i>You're so good with words.</i>

1684
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:47,100
<i>Who cares if it's not getting published?</i>

1685
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:51,700
<i>There are so many beautiful
and painful things about it.</i>

1686
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:55,500
<i>Did you really go through all that?</i>

1687
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:58,250
<i>Must have been awful.</i>

1688
02:01:58,350 --> 02:02:03,250
<i>And the sister character...
Geez, what a wreck!</i>

1689
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:07,850
<i>But I have to say that, well,
I was really confused by the ending.</i>

1690
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:11,400
<i>I mean, did the father finally
commit suicide, or what?</i>

1691
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,500
<i>It's driving me crazy.</i>

1692
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:18,200
<i>Anyway...</i>

1693
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:22,200
<i>It's turned cold and rainy here lately.</i>

1694
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:24,900
<i>But I like winter.</i>

1695
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:29,850
<i>So, listen, if you ever do decide to come
up here again, you should let me know.</i>

1696
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:32,750
<i>I would say stop by the restaurant,
but to tell you the truth,</i>

1697
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:35,300
<i>I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be working there,</i>

1698
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,500
<i>because I'm going to graduate soon.</i>

1699
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,150
<i>So, I'll probably want to relocate.</i>

1700
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:42,200
<i>I mean, we'll see.</i>

1701
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:47,650
<i>Anyway, like I said, I really loved your novel.</i>

1702
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:52,650
<i>Don't give up, Miles. Keep writing.</i>

1703
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:54,700
<i>I hope you're well.</i>

1704
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
<i>Bye.</i>
