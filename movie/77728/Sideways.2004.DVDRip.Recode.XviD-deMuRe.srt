1
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,295
Oh, fuck.

2
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,473
- Uh, yeah?
- Miles, can you move your car, please?

3
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,476
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

4
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,979
- You didn't park too good. Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,064
Hold on.

6
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,753
Sorry. Sorry, gentlemen.

7
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,964
Sorry.

8
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,081
Oh, fuck me!

9
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,335
I know I said
I would be there by noon...

10
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,255
but, uh, there's all of this work
going on at my building...

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,758
and it's just a total nightmare.

12
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,261
I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning...

13
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,263
but I'm on my way.

14
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,849
I'm out the door right now.

15
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,159
- Hi, Simon.
- Hey, Miles.

16
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,161
- Triple espresso, please?
- For here?

17
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,164
Uh, no, actually.
I'm running late. Make it to go.

18
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,167
And give me a New York Times
and a spinach croissant.

19
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,836
Thank you.

20
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,946
- Ah!
- Well, hello!

21
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,282
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?
- Come on in.

22
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,285
- Thank you. Is Jack still here?
- Yes.

23
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,167
Shot on the way to the 118.

24
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,671
Look what the cat dragged.

25
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,674
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.
- Hey.

26
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,676
Somebody finally arrived.

27
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,678
You finally got here. Mr. Prompt.

28
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,681
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?
- Hi. How are you?

29
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,185
We were thinking maybe you went
the wrong way, you went to Tijuana...

30
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,187
- Right.
- and they don't let you back.

31
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,189
- Yes! Yes!
- Daddy!

32
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,192
- I had to bribe them.
- Hey, Miles.

33
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,194
Hey. How are you, Christine?

34
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,196
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.

35
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,199
Unbelievable.
It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.

36
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,202
People getting an early start
on the weekend, I guess.

37
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,204
Granted, I got a late start, but...

38
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,706
Well, we're just glad you made it.

39
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,209
Christine, why don't you
ask Miles about the cake?

40
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,211
- Oh, good idea. Come with me.
- What's this?

41
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,214
We don't really have time for that,
'cause we gotta hit the road.

42
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,509
- Oh, come on!
It's just gonna take a second!
- Yeah.

43
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,053
Mmm.

44
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,347
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,350
- Uh...
- Yes, congratulations.

46
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,187
Yes, well, uh,
it's not exactly finalized yet.

47
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,732
- So... There has been some interest, and...
- Your friend is modest.

48
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,027
Oh, come on, Miles.
Don't be so modest. Indulge them.

49
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,364
- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What is the subject of your book?

50
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,700
- Nonfiction?
- Uh, no. It's... It's a novel.

51
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,035
- Fiction. Yes.
- Oh.

52
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,080
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life...

53
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,083
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.

54
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,377
Good. I like nonfiction.

55
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,921
There is so much to know
about this world.

56
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,425
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

57
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,887
That's an interesting perspective.

58
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,348
- So, which one do you like better?
- Oh, well, I like them both.

59
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,894
But, um, if pressed, I would have to say
that I prefer the dark.

60
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,396
Told ya!

61
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,690
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

62
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,782
- Bye.
- Bye.

63
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,707
Bye.

64
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,710
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

65
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,922
- We're supposed to be
a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.

66
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,966
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

67
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,594
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.

68
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,431
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

69
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,476
Why did you tell them
that my novel was being published?

70
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,188
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

71
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,608
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

72
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,654
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors
was passing it to a senior editor.

73
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,156
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

74
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,158
No. It's a long shot.

75
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,745
Besides, Conundrum,
it's just a small specialty press.

76
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,747
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

77
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,749
You know? I've stopped caring.

78
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,752
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.

79
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:02,005
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.

80
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,508
I think this is the one. Huh?

81
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,510
I'm really proud of you, man.

82
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,637
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?

83
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,850
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?

84
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,477
- I've been saving it. Don't...
- All right. I won't open it.

85
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,521
Jack!

86
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,690
Half of it gone.

87
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:23,193
Hey, shut up. Okay?

88
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,196
Here's to a great week.

89
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,282
Come on.

90
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,160
Yes. Absolutely.

91
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,162
Despite your crass behavior...

92
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,456
I'm actually glad
we're getting this time together.

93
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,458
Yeah. Me too.

94
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,461
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

95
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,548
- Was beginning to think
it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!

96
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,550
That's 100% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.

97
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,552
They don't even make it anymore.

98
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,512
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,556
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh, Jesus.

100
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,558
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

101
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,895
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
- Just tell me.

102
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,898
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.

103
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,859
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run...

104
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,904
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation...

105
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,908
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?

106
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,910
- Oh, yeah. yeah.
- And?

107
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,912
It's great.

108
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,915
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

109
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,334
Just seems... I don't know,
more congealed or something.

110
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:24,880
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

111
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,551
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

112
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,553
There is no new ending.

113
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,556
Page 750 on is exactly the same.

114
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,144
Well, maybe it just seemed new...

115
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,897
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

116
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,941
Yeah! That must be it!

117
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,696
Whoa. Why are we getting off?

118
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,699
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

119
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,702
- I just thought we could say
a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

120
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,704
Look, it's her birthday tomorrow.
Okay?

121
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,041
- And I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.
- Okay.

122
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,961
- It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.
- Okay!

123
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,964
I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?

124
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,050
Uh, oh... 70-something.

125
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:19,142
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.

126
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,952
Thank you.

127
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,882
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

128
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,884
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

129
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,721
Oh, my God! Miles! And Jack!

130
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,224
What a surprise!

131
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,187
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

132
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,189
Happy birthday, Mom.

133
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,191
They're from both of us.

134
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,987
- A famous actor
bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!

135
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,657
- Don't I feel special?
- And champagne!

136
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,911
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!

137
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,913
Isn't that nice.

138
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,333
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...

139
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,377
marrying no less
than Derek Sommersby.

140
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,381
Gosh, that was, like, 11 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

141
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,511
Well, you were wonderful in that show!

142
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:40,849
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

143
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,393
Oh, now, Miles...

144
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,523
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

145
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,525
Look how I'm dressed!

146
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,027
I've gotta run and put my face on.

147
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,029
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

148
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,656
Oh, stop it!

149
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,658
Make yourselves comfortable.

150
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,661
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

151
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,580
Along with the battle casualties...

152
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,582
Just a snack.

153
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,584
the Germans lost almost a million men.

154
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,088
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.

155
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:18,262
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

156
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,764
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.

157
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,766
I-Is this chicken?

158
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,768
I could have made something fancier...

159
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,771
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...

160
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,859
was coming for a visit
and bringing a certain special friend.

161
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,610
It was a surprise, Mom.

162
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,113
And I could've already put clean sheets...

163
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,198
on the other bed and the foldout.

164
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,242
You are staying.

165
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:45,205
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up
at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

166
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,499
They do a magnificent job there.

167
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,502
- You talked to Wendy?
- Just now.

168
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,088
She's thrilled! And the twins...

169
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,591
No, no, I bet. I bet. Yeah.

170
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,636
Well, you know, Jack is pretty eager
to, uh, to get up to, um...

171
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,805
You know.

172
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,100
Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.

173
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,105
Well, you boys do what you want.

174
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,901
I just thought it would be nice for us
to be together as a family on my birthday.

175
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,236
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

176
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,073
I'll be right back.

177
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,581
And what was that other one you did?

178
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,083
The one where you were the jogger.

179
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,003
Oh, that was for, um, Spray 'n Wash.

180
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,005
Spray 'n Wash! That's the one!

181
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:02,176
Gosh. I remember the girl that was
in it with me. She was somethin'.

182
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,179
I just remember you jogging.

183
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,681
Whoo-hoo!

184
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,184
So, when's the wedding?

185
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,353
Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.

186
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,356
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond.
My main man.

187
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,318
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?

188
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,780
I just got divorced, Phyllis.

189
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,949
Two years ago, buddy.

190
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,952
You should get back together...

191
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,288
with Victoria.

192
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,082
She was good for you.

193
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,960
She was good for you!

194
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,463
And so beautiful, and so intelligent.

195
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,465
You knew her, right?

196
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,343
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

197
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,846
I'm worried about you, Miles.

198
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,393
Do you need some money?

199
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,814
Jack.

200
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,443
Jack.

201
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,445
Jack, come on.

202
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,621
A rubber bag food slinger?

203
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,623
Are you kidding me?

204
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,625
Our super-amazing tree house...

205
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,628
brought about by our
two-by-four technology...

206
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,881
Jack! No, no, no, no. She'll wake up.

207
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,883
Who did this?

208
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,886
- I did!
- What?

209
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,888
She was tired, silly.

210
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,890
Our ship was so high!

211
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,892
They need a vacation!

212
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,478
Hamster holiday! Fun for all!

213
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,370
Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.
You know what I mean?

214
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,832
Oh. She's a kid, for God's sake.

215
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,835
As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us in the first place.

216
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,463
Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks
looking at me all the time. All ages.

217
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,465
Dudes too.

218
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,343
Well, it's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.

219
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,722
- It's never free.
- You need to get laid, Miles.

220
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,516
- That's gonna be my best-man gift
to you this week.

221
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,852
I'm gonna get you laid.

222
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,729
Wonderful.

223
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:22,649
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate
or a penknife or any of that other horseshit.

224
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,860
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.

225
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,654
You have been officially depressed
for, like, two years now.

226
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,657
You're a negative guy anyway,
even back in college.

227
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,659
- Mm-hmm.
- And now it's worse.

228
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:36,038
You're wasting away. Teaching English
to fucking eighth-graders?

229
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,041
When they oughta be reading what you wrote.
Your books, Miles.

230
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,919
- I'm working on it.
- Not working hard enough.

231
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,422
- Are you still seeing that shrink?
- I saw him on Monday.

232
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,383
I spent most of the time
helping him with his computer.

233
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,055
Well, I say fuck therapy and...
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?

234
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,224
And Lexapro, yes.

235
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,685
Well, I say fuck that too.
You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.

236
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,605
Okay, Jack... Jack...

237
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,192
This week is not about me.
It is about you.

238
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,238
I'm gonna show you a good time.

239
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,741
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf...

240
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,744
we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...

241
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:19,164
and we're gonna send you off in style,
mon frère.

242
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,084
And get your bone smooched.

243
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,394
You know what?

244
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,106
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road exit
and hit Sanford first. Okay?

245
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,650
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

246
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,653
These guys make top-notch pinot
and chardonnay.

247
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,155
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

248
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:55,158
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no, no. I like all varietals.

249
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,912
I just don't generally like the way
they manipulate chardonnay in California.

250
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,833
- Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

251
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,837
You see, the reason that this region
is so good for pinot...

252
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,299
is that the cold air off the Pacific
flows in at night...

253
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,885
and it just cools down the berries.

254
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,804
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

255
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,433
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

256
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,438
Let me show you how this is done.

257
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,441
First thing... hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

258
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,693
You're looking for color and clarity.

259
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,196
- Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

260
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,324
Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy?

261
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,284
- Okay?
- Okay.

262
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,286
Now tip it.

263
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:43,832
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

264
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,877
That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.

265
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,879
It's usually
more important with reds.

266
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,881
- Okay?
- Okay.

267
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,883
Now stick your nose in it.

268
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,385
- Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

269
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,721
Really get your nose right in there.
Really...

270
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,391
Mmm. A little citrus.

271
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,520
Maybe some strawberry. Mmm.

272
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,357
Passion fruit. Mmm.

273
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,401
And... Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...

274
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,030
soupcon of like, uh, asparagus and...

275
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,116
There's a... just a flutter of, like, a...

276
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,036
like, a nutty Edam cheese.

277
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,163
Wow.

278
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,165
Mmm!

279
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,167
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

280
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:29,378
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

281
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,422
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

282
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,424
Oxygenating it opens it up.

283
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,177
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

284
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,596
Smell again.

285
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,599
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of 'em.

286
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,185
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.

287
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,898
Mmm! Ahh.

288
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,529
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?

289
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,282
Well, usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities...

290
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,284
but this one is pretty damn good.

291
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,288
- This is the new one. Right, Chris?
- Just released two months ago.

292
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,290
- Nice job.
- We like it.

293
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,625
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

294
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,628
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

295
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,465
Are you chewing gum?

296
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,464
Do you think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

297
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,466
Whoa!

298
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,969
Do you think I'm doing the right thing, Miles?
Tell me the truth.

299
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,388
I mean, you've been there.

300
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:07,392
Well, you know, I... I think that you
waited for some good reason...

301
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,395
and that you proposed to Christine
for some good reason...

302
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,898
so I think it's great.

303
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,900
It's time.

304
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,903
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

305
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,907
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

306
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,910
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

307
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,914
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

308
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,918
Which is something, considering how long
it took him to get over my not being Armenian.

309
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,920
So I'm thinking about it.

310
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,922
But I don't know.

311
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,924
Might get a little incestuous.

312
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,927
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

313
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,429
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

314
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:47,266
This would just provide some stability.

315
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:51,019
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

316
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,022
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

317
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,024
We're not getting any younger, Miles.

318
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,734
No. No.

319
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,909
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

320
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,911
- Miles!
- Sir.

321
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,414
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

322
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,417
- When's your novel coming out?
We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

323
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,420
This is my buddy Jack.
He's getting married next week.

324
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,881
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

325
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,925
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

326
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,928
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

327
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,930
Absolument.

328
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,933
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

329
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:31,977
Very special. Thank you.

330
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,982
Mmm!

331
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,569
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

332
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,533
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

333
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,994
Pour us a couple, will ya.

334
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,205
Yeah. It's tight.

335
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,792
There you are, gentlemen.

336
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,879
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

337
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,550
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

338
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,552
It's gonna be great.

339
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,638
Here's to us.

340
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,063
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,565
Check out that chick.

342
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,276
Oh. Yeah. That's Maya.

343
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,279
- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.

344
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:27,950
- You know that chick?
- Yes. Jack, this is where I eat
when I come up here.

345
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,285
You know?
It's practically my office.

346
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,288
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

347
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:37,292
Maya's great.
She's worked here a year, year and a half.

348
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,294
She's incredibly hot.

349
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,630
Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.

350
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,674
Check out the rock.

351
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,676
Oh, that doesn't mean shit.

352
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,678
When Christine worked at Sushi Roku...

353
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,472
she wore a big engagement ring
to keep guys from hitting on her.

354
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,475
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think I met her?

355
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,480
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at U.C. Santa Barbara.

356
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,942
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

357
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,945
Jack, you don't know anything
about this woman.

358
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:08,156
Calm down. Let's just eat.

359
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:13,495
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

360
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,498
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

361
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,209
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

362
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,921
Uh... no, actually.

363
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,840
But... thank you.

364
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,384
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

365
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,386
You guys been out tasting?

366
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,680
Oh, you know it. You know it.

367
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,849
Oh, this is my friend, Jack. Jack, Maya.

368
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,893
- Hiya.
- Hi.

369
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,562
Well, it's good to see you. Bye, Miles.

370
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,148
Oh. Back to work.

371
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,236
- Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

372
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,238
And she's obviously into you.

373
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,240
What else do you know about her?

374
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,493
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

375
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:56,538
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.

376
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,541
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

377
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,085
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton, Jack.

378
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,087
How is that ever gonna work out?

379
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:06,507
You dick. Why do you have to
focus on the negative?

380
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,344
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

381
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,056
You're blind, dude. Blind.

382
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:18,101
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

383
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,233
Hey, Gary.

384
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,235
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

385
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,237
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

386
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,239
Well, hey, guys. Do you mind?

387
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,241
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

388
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,701
Please. Light up, light up.

389
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:40,290
In fact, would you like to join us?

390
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,878
Sure.

391
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,717
So, how's that book coming, Miles?

392
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,720
I think you were almost finished with it
the last time we talked.

393
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:58,141
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

394
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,143
It's getting published.

395
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,564
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

396
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,149
Well, congratulations.

397
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,151
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

398
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:10,237
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

399
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:13,323
Are you a writer too?

400
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,325
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

401
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,828
Really. What kind of stuff?

402
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,830
Mmm, a lot of TV.

403
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:23,333
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

404
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:28,005
But lately it's been a lot of commercial work.
Nationals, mostly.

405
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,007
Anything I might know?

406
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,676
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

407
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,097
Now with a low, low
5.8% A.P.R. financing!

408
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,099
That's hilarious!

409
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:42,102
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

410
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,104
- You are not.
- He is.

411
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,356
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

412
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,358
Side effects may include oily discharge...

413
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,360
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.

414
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,530
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble...

415
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,532
you're dead, asshole!

416
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,534
Yeah.

417
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,786
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

418
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,040
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

419
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:08,170
I think we're just gonna go back
to the motel and crash.

420
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,216
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of a long drive up here.

421
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,343
- Mmm.
- Where are you staying?

422
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,386
Uh, the Windmill.

423
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,430
Windmill.

424
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,391
The girl is looking to party...

425
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,394
and you tell her we're going back
to the motel and crash?

426
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,396
- Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired, Jack.

427
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,857
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

428
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,859
She lit up like a pinball machine...

429
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,362
when she found out
your novel was getting published.

430
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,864
Now I have another lie to live down.

431
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,867
- Thanks, Jack.
- Just trying to get you a little action.

432
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,370
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

433
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,873
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

434
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,376
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

435
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,420
And, by the way, I was right...
she's not married.

436
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,548
- How do you know?
- No rock.

437
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:56,301
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

438
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,596
Oh.

439
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:21,243
What's the plan for today, Miles?

440
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,245
Aha.

441
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,914
Good. Um, we head up north...

442
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,916
Begin the grape tour up there...

443
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,918
work our way south...

444
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,920
so that the more we drink...

445
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,089
the closer we get to the motel.

446
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,429
What's your problem?

447
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,145
What is it?

448
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,317
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles...

449
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:56,320
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...

450
00:28:56,445 --> 00:29:01,074
with all of your depression and anxiety
and neg-head downer shit.

451
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,993
Oh.

452
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:06,121
Well, now the cards are on the table.

453
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,165
Yes, they are.

454
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:11,752
- Ah.
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.

455
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:16,507
I am going to get laid before I get married
on Saturday. Do you read me?

456
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,927
Sure, big guy. Absolutely.

457
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,929
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.

458
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,264
It's, uh, your party, evidently.

459
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,266
Why don't you just, uh...

460
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,270
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

461
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,272
No, Miles!

462
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,858
Man, this is our week to get crazy.

463
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,818
We should both be cutting loose.

464
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:40,781
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

465
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,576
It's something we should share.

466
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,112
This is our Syrah.

467
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,197
Okay.

468
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,576
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

469
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,536
That's a big one.

470
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:40,090
But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.

471
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:43,552
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

472
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,222
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

473
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:50,142
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

474
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,770
Mmm. Fill up there, bub.

475
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,422
This is our estate chardonnay.

476
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,592
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

477
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,636
Stephanie.

478
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,679
Stephanie. Nice.

479
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,433
So, what do you think?

480
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,435
Mmm. Quaffable.

481
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,771
But, uh, far from transcendent.

482
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,773
I like it. Tastes great.

483
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,775
Oak-y.

484
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,735
This is a cabernet franc.

485
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,738
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

486
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:47,407
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

487
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,409
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria...

488
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,412
and it was a silver medal winner...

489
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,414
at Paso Robles last year.

490
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:57,084
Hmm.

491
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,127
Mmm.

492
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,129
Well, I will tell you something.

493
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:04,550
I've come never to expect greatness from
a cab franc, and this one is no different.

494
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,553
It's kind of a hollow, flabby, overripe...

495
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,055
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.

496
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,516
So, um, do you live around here,
Stephanie?

497
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,186
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

498
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,689
We're just over in Buellton.

499
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,691
The Windmill Inn.

500
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,693
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

501
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,696
Do you happen to know a gal named Maya
that works at The Hitching Post?

502
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,699
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

503
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:31,326
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

504
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,328
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

505
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,330
Oh. Champing at the bit, huh?

506
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,416
Sure.

507
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,336
This is our estate Syrah.

508
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,384
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

509
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:50,470
I know. I need to be spanked.

510
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,724
Excuse me.

511
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,061
The Syrah?

512
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,865
Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.

513
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,909
- You have the keys.
- I do?

514
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,911
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

515
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,913
- So, we're on.
- What?

516
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:20,042
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.

517
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,044
- Wi... With Maya?
- Yeah.

518
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,546
She's been divorced a year now, buddy.

519
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,548
This chick Stephanie?

520
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:29,551
She's got it all goin' on.

521
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,553
Well, she is cute, yeah.

522
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,555
Cute? She's a fuckin' hottie.

523
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,518
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin' married?
What's the matter with you?

524
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,406
- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.

525
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:54,618
Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.

526
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,788
You know,
once we had a picnic here...

527
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,207
and we drank a '95 Opus One.

528
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,752
With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.

529
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:08,590
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

530
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:12,553
She can even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

531
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:17,349
Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.

532
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,601
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

533
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:23,105
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

534
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,774
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

535
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,777
She got remarried.

536
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,821
She what?

537
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,449
When?

538
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,077
About a month ago.

539
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,079
Maybe six weeks.

540
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:42,958
To that guy...
that guy with the restaurant?

541
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,302
Miles?

542
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,345
Miles.

543
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,725
I'd like to go home now.

544
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,727
Miles, get out of the car.

545
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,271
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

546
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,273
You know...

547
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,775
She bringing him to the wedding?

548
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,861
What do you think?

549
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,990
Why didn't you tell me
about this before, Jack?

550
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,869
Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.

551
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,872
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

552
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,292
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party, man.

553
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,294
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.

554
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:29,296
Persona non grata.

555
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:33,884
Everybody's gonna be holding their breath,
waiting to see if I get drunk and make a scene.

556
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,678
No, no. No. Look.

557
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:37,929
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

558
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:39,056
I talked to Victoria. Okay?

559
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,058
She's cool. Everybody's cool.

560
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,644
I'm sorry. You've been talking...

561
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,647
Behind my back...

562
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,732
you've been talking about it?

563
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,319
What are you doing?

564
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:54,571
Come back here.

565
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,657
Miles!

566
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,703
- Come here. Give me that bottle.
- Back off, Jack.

567
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:03,705
- Come on...
- Back off, man!

568
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,875
- Give me that bottle.
- No.

569
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,671
Miles.

570
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,841
Miles!

571
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,869
A lot of people
out there think they can make it.

572
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:27,873
What better thing in life is to chase the
dream and not be afraid of going after it?

573
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:32,377
James Lepp next to play.
Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.

574
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:37,299
I'm gonna go for a swim,
get the blood flowing. You wanna come?

575
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,927
No. I wanna watch this.

576
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:42,471
Okay.

577
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:47,017
Should start this ball one or two inches
outside the left edge.

578
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,271
Go in.

579
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:56,777
- Great putt.
- Absolutely. Great speed.

580
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,991
Miles.

581
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:06,161
Miles.

582
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:09,331
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.

583
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,171
This fuckin' chick in the Jacuzzi...

584
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,173
Oh, dude!

585
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:22,177
This place is wide open.
I'm goin' fuckin' nuts up here, man.

586
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,847
- Hey, what should I wear?
- I don't know.

587
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,891
Something casual, but nice.
They think you're a writer.

588
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,060
Right. Okay.

589
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,187
Mmm.

590
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,692
Do you have any other shoes?

591
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,652
Uh-uh.

592
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,737
Hmm.

593
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,621
Hey, honey.

594
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:52,166
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.

595
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,169
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

596
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,380
Probably stay out late, so I just thought
I'd call and say good night now.

597
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,300
Yeah. I miss you too.

598
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,386
Yeah. I love you too.

599
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:08,265
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

600
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,268
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

601
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,270
People love that guy.

602
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:16,273
And don't forget...
your novel is coming out in the fall.

603
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:19,276
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

604
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,361
Come here, Miles. Come here.

605
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:27,868
Do not sabotage me.

606
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,871
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

607
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,874
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

608
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,877
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

609
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,380
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am not drinking any fucking merlot!

610
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:42,883
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles.

611
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,885
Jesus. No merlot.

612
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,095
Did you bring your Xanax?

613
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,682
All right.

614
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,684
Come here.

615
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,354
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

616
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,357
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

617
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,276
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

618
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:08,283
Hi. Just looking for some friends.

619
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,755
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

620
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,757
- Hi, Miles.
- Good. How are you?

621
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:27,261
Hello, Maya.

622
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:30,264
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
- Thank you.

623
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,975
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

624
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,977
So, what's good here?

625
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,313
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

626
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:41,358
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

627
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,361
- What time did you close up at Ka... Is it...
- Kalyra.

628
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:48,532
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good,
around 5:30, 6:00.

629
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,535
- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were...

630
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,037
- That's nice.
- It's aged 12 months in oak.

631
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:56,039
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

632
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,041
Huh. Interesting. It's good.

633
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:01,336
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

634
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,548
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

635
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:08,844
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

636
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,971
- Right.
- Just... small stuff.

637
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,973
Uh, hints of clove.

638
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,975
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

639
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,311
Yeah. Mmm.

640
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:19,313
Sorry. It's good.

641
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:21,690
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

642
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,692
Good. Okay.

643
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,694
Oh, that's... that...

644
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,530
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

645
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,532
I didn't hear him say that.

646
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:35,037
- Whenever I say something he said...
- Very good.

647
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,539
No, actually... No. That one.
N-Not this one...

648
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm having that too.

649
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,214
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

650
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,924
That's what I'm saying.

651
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,926
For our soup we have corn chowder...

652
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,429
and for our entrees we have medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...

653
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,599
served with a root vegetable foulon
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

654
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,601
And finally...

655
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,604
- I have to explain my credentials.
- Yes!

656
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,065
Miles, what does this remind you of?

657
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,068
"Red wine. Red wine."

658
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,446
He was brought up on a lot of charges.

659
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,408
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

660
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,410
Right.

661
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:18,413
After all, tonight
we are celebrating Miles's book deal.

662
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,415
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

663
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,125
Wow, Miles!

664
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,378
- Ohh!
- Well, in that case...

665
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,850
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

666
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,106
Ancient way of treating the grape.

667
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:47,276
Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.

668
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:51,655
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

669
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,408
So everyone's going back to that.

670
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,796
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

671
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:10,799
- It's not a... It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,801
Your lips look soft.

673
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:17,806
- The whole area is...
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

674
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,893
What do they call the...

675
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:28,484
Malibu... It's Malibu Canyon.

676
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,615
I don't know what the hell
I'm trying to say.

677
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,066
Hello?

678
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,151
Victoria?

679
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,863
Miles?

680
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:18,450
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?

681
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,579
What... Uh... What's on your mind?

682
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,581
Oh, nothin'. I...

683
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,875
Just heard that you got remarried.

684
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,211
Congratulations. I, uh...

685
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:32,214
Boy, I didn't think you had the stomach
for another go-around.

686
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,216
Oh, Miles, you're drunk.

687
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:37,219
Oh, just a little local pinot,
you know.

688
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:41,223
A little burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune.

689
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:44,726
- Where are you?
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.

690
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,729
New owners. Cozy ambience, uh...

691
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:51,024
Excellent food too.
You should, uh... You should try it.

692
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:55,404
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.

693
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:59,199
Hello?

694
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:01,451
- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's...

695
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:04,413
All right, I just...
I wanted to let you know...

696
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:08,417
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

697
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,047
so just in case you were dreading some sort of,
you know, run-in or something like that...

698
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:16,091
well, you worry no more...

699
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:18,093
because I'm not gonna be there.

700
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:21,722
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

701
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,099
What is his name?

702
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,269
Ken.

703
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:29,271
Ken! Right.

704
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,273
Ken.

705
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,275
I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.

706
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,695
No... You know, it's just...
I-I-I heard about this...

707
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,448
for the first time, uh, today.

708
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,450
Uh, your getting remarried, that is.

709
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:45,954
And, uh, I was kind of taken aback.

710
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,124
Just... hard to believe.

711
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:55,172
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...

712
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,174
for us somewhere down the road.

713
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:59,676
And I just, uh...

714
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,678
- Miles.
- Huh?

715
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,681
Maybe it is better
if you don't come to the wedding.

716
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:10,354
All righty, Vicki. Whatever you say.

717
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,439
You're the boss.

718
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:25,285
Huh? I don't know.

719
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:28,163
Welcome back.

720
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,165
Take it easy.

721
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:35,003
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes. I'm fine.

722
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,047
Thank you.

723
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,928
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Excuse us.

724
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,972
Sure.

725
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:47,391
- Mmm.
- All right.

726
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,893
Yeah. Don't take too long.

727
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:53,397
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, girls.

728
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,066
What the fuck?
What is up with you?

729
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,068
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah...

730
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:01,196
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

731
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:02,906
Where were you?

732
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,992
Bathroom.

733
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,036
Did you drink and dial?

734
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:09,830
Hmm?

735
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:12,207
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

736
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,710
Victoria is gone. Gone.

737
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,212
Poof! In the wind.

738
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:20,382
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.

739
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,384
Maya... Fuckin' Maya... She's great!

740
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:25,387
She's cool, she's funny, she knows wine.

741
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,848
What is this morose, come-down bullshit?

742
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,350
These girls wanna party with us.

743
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:32,477
Huh?

744
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,731
And what was that 10-minute lecture
on, what, Vouvrays?

745
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:38,484
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

746
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,904
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

747
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,907
Have you forgotten all the bad times
you had with Victoria...

748
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:47,534
how small she could make you feel?

749
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,579
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?

750
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,581
Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.

751
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,750
Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?

752
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,753
Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.

753
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,214
Reel her in.
Let's ratchet this up a notch.

754
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:04,009
Here. Drink some agua fria.

755
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,597
Hey!

756
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:10,599
- Hey!
- Mmm.

757
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:15,229
Ah. Well, so, uh,
shall we get some dessert?

758
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:19,233
Uh, well, we were thinking, um, uh,
why don't we go back to my place?

759
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:22,069
I've got wine, some insane cheeses,
music, whatever.

760
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,071
Yeah!

761
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,451
Waiter!

762
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,467
Come here.

763
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,469
Uh-huh.

764
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,805
- One for you, three for me.
- Mmm.

765
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,975
You sure you wanna do this?

766
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,483
- We're here!
- Hey!

767
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,902
- Hey!
- Where were you guys?

768
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:08,240
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.

769
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

770
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:12,369
- Oh, Miles.
- Yeah?

771
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:15,372
- Maya's in the back, just past the kitchen.
- Okay.

772
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,374
Thanks.

773
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:28,343
Hi.

774
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:30,470
Hey.

775
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:33,348
- Oh, has she got anything good?
- Oh, yeah.

776
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:36,310
Steph's way into pinots and Syrahs.

777
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,312
- Hey, Steph!
- Yeah?

778
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:42,191
- Can we really open anything we want?
- Yeah, yeah. Anything.

779
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,610
Uh, except the Richebourg.

780
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:48,155
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel.

781
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,199
I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.

782
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,535
Oh, good Lord. Um, look at that.

783
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:59,833
I think... this guy's more our speed.

784
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,835
Andrew Murray.

785
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,338
Well, okay. All right.

786
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,885
So, what gems do you have
in your collection?

787
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:13,096
Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.

788
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:16,099
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.

789
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:19,102
No, I've never really had the wallet for that.

790
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:21,605
I just have to live bottle to bottle.

791
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,107
I've got things I'm saving, definitely.

792
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:28,612
I guess the star would be
a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

793
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,615
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,
and it's just sitting there?

794
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,617
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.

795
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:35,619
- Okay.
- I'm serious! Hurry!

796
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:37,621
All right. I would, I would.

797
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:40,707
The '61s are peaking right now, aren't they?
That's what I've read.

798
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,751
No, that's right, yeah.

799
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:45,754
It might be too late already.
What are you waiting for?

800
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,758
Oh, I don't know.
A special occasion with the right person.

801
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:54,137
- It was supposed to be for
my 10th wedding anniversary, but...
- Mmm.

802
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:57,558
You know, the day you open
a '61 Cheval Blanc...

803
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,601
that's the special occasion.

804
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:06,066
So, uh, how long
have you been into wine?

805
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,986
I got serious about seven years ago.

806
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:12,447
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- '88 Sassicaia.

807
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,825
- Ah! Well, congratulations.
- Mmm.

808
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,827
- Yeah.
- That's very good.

809
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:19,204
- Well...
- That would do it. Yeah.

810
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,206
Hmm.

811
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:23,292
Mmm.

812
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,880
Oh, wow, that's nice.
That's very good.

813
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,883
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.

814
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:32,968
How about you?

815
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,973
I think they overdid it a little.

816
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:40,350
Too much alcohol.
It overwhelms the fruit.

817
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:42,436
Huh.

818
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,442
Yeah. Yeah.

819
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,944
I'd say you're right on the money.

820
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:53,447
Very good. Nice.

821
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,491
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

822
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:59,828
Mmm! Is that Stephanie's kid?

823
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:01,830
Oh. Yeah. That's Siena.

824
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:04,708
- Oh, she's a sweetie.
- Cute. Cute.

825
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,710
Where is she?

826
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,712
- She's at her grandmother's.
- Oh.

827
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:11,048
Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.

828
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:13,050
You got kids?

829
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,052
Uh, me? No. No.

830
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:18,555
No, I'd just fuck 'em up.

831
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,227
No, that was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce... no kids.

832
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,229
Yeah. Same here.

833
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,231
Good.

834
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:29,316
Let's go in there.

835
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:35,489
Now, for a low, low
4.8% A.P.R. financing...

836
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:49,586
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

837
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:52,089
Yeah, I would say that.

838
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,675
Yeah.

839
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:57,678
So, what's your novel about?

840
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,680
What's my... Oh, brother.

841
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:03,183
Well, it's, uh...
it's difficult to summarize.

842
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,185
Um...

843
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:08,188
it starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...

844
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:11,567
about a guy taking care
of his father after a stroke.

845
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,903
- Oh.
- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.

846
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,905
But only... only loosely.

847
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,907
What's the title?

848
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,909
The Day After Yesterday.

849
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:23,412
Oh. You mean today.

850
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:29,042
Um... uh, yeah.
I mean, r-right. But it's more...

851
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:32,754
So it's about, like,
death and mortality, or...

852
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,424
Uh, yeah...

853
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,426
Y... Not really.

854
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:40,429
I, uh... It de... It jumps around a lot.

855
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:43,390
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

856
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:46,393
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.

857
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:49,897
And, uh, a lot of other things happen...
parallel narratives.

858
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,899
It's kind of a mess.

859
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,902
And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves...

860
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,904
or devolves...

861
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:59,281
into this sort of
Robbe-Grillet mystery.

862
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:01,283
You know?

863
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,410
But no real resolution.

864
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:05,829
- Wow.
- It...

865
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:08,916
Well, I think it's really great
you're getting it published.

866
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,002
Really. I mean, I know how hard it is
just to write it, even.

867
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:14,004
Yeah.

868
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:17,299
I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday...

869
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:20,302
and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.

870
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,429
- A paper, huh?
- Yeah.

871
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:25,474
I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.

872
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,935
Sorta chipping away on it.

873
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:30,687
- Horticulture? Really?
- Mmm.

874
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:33,816
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.

875
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,319
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.

876
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,947
Horticulture? Wow.

877
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:43,033
So, do you want to work
in a winery or something?

878
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,661
Maybe.

879
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,831
Oh.

880
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,043
Hmm.

881
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:55,170
So, when can I read your book?

882
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:01,426
Well, I... You know, I... Well, I do happen
to have a manuscript in my car.

883
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:03,345
Um, it's not proofed or anything...

884
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,681
so it's... it's full of typos.

885
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:08,350
- If you don't mind typos...
- Oh, no. Who cares?

886
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,352
I'm the queen of typos.

887
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,437
Okay.

888
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,220
Mmm.

889
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:47,306
Ahh.

890
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:53,061
You know, can I ask you
a personal question, Miles?

891
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:55,063
Sure.

892
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,065
Why are you so into pinot?

893
00:55:57,149 --> 00:56:00,319
I mean, it's like a thing with you.

894
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:04,198
Uh... I don't know. I don't know.

895
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:08,535
Um... it's a hard grape to grow.

896
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:10,787
As you know. Right?

897
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:13,207
It's, uh... It's thin-skinned...

898
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,043
temperamental, ripens early.

899
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,087
It's... You know, it's not a survivor...

900
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,089
like cabernet...

901
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,091
which can just grow anywhere...

902
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:26,094
and thrive even when it's neglected.

903
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,932
No, pinot needs constant care
and attention. You know?

904
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:32,434
And, in fact, it can only grow...

905
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:36,438
in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.

906
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:40,484
And... And only...

907
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:45,489
the most patient
and nurturing of growers...

908
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:48,116
can do it, really.

909
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:51,245
Only somebody
who really takes the time...

910
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:55,165
to understand pinot's potential...

911
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,168
can then coax it
into its fullest expression.

912
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:01,630
And then? I mean...

913
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:04,842
Oh, its flavors, they're just
the most haunting and brilliant...

914
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:08,512
and thrilling and subtle and...

915
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,558
ancient on the planet.

916
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:20,482
No, I mean, you know, cabernets
can be powerful and exalting too...

917
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:24,153
but they seem prosaic to me,
for some reason, by comparison.

918
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:26,613
I don't know. I don't know.

919
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,615
What about you?

920
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:30,617
What about me?

921
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:34,037
I don't know.
Why are you into wine?

922
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:38,542
Oh, I... I think I...

923
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:42,045
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.

924
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:46,008
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

925
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,010
- You know?
- Right.

926
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:51,847
- But then I discovered that
I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,849
And the more I drank...

928
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:56,894
the more I liked
what it made me think about.

929
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:58,896
Like what?

930
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:00,898
Like what a fraud he was.

931
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,192
Wow.

932
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,820
No, I mean, I like to think
about the life of wine.

933
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:08,822
Yeah.

934
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,866
How it's a living thing.

935
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,536
I like to think about...

936
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,040
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing...

937
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:20,459
how the sun was shining...

938
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,544
if it rained.

939
00:58:23,754 --> 00:58:25,631
I like to think about...

940
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:29,092
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...

941
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:33,680
and, if it's an old wine,
how many of them must be dead by now.

942
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:39,394
I like how wine continues to evolve.

943
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,397
Like,
if I opened a bottle of wine today...

944
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:46,527
it would taste different than if
I'd opened it on any other day.

945
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:51,073
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

946
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:56,119
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

947
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,207
That is, until it peaks...

948
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,251
like your '61.

949
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:06,797
And then it begins its steady...

950
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:09,800
inevitable decline.

951
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,427
Hmm.

952
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:16,682
And it tastes so fucking good.

953
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,451
Yeah.

954
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,079
But you know, I... I, uh...

955
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,623
I like other wines besides pinot too.

956
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:44,418
I mean, lately
I've been really into Rieslings.

957
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,754
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?

958
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,590
Mm-hmm.

959
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:54,052
There's a bathroom in the back?

960
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:56,847
- Yeah. It's through the kitchen.
- I'll be right back.

961
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,988
God, you are such a fuckin' loser.

962
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:16,200
You make me so fuckin' sick.

963
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:19,411
Oh, God. Ah, come on.

964
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:39,473
Hi.

965
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,517
- I was just getting some water.
- Okay.

966
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:43,644
- You want some water?
- No.

967
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:46,313
Okay. It's getting kind of late.

968
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,658
I should really go.

969
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:31,400
So you know how to get to the Windmill?
Two rights and a left.

970
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:33,485
- Got it.
- Okay.

971
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:36,071
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.

972
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:39,032
Good. So did I.

973
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:44,163
- Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.
- Um...

974
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:48,125
Did you still want to read my novel?

975
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,961
Oh, yeah. Of course.

976
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:57,759
Yeah.

977
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:01,805
- Great.
- Just a sec.

978
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:07,978
- Here.
- Oh, wow.

979
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:10,063
Well, I hope you like it.

980
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:14,902
And feel free to stop reading it any time.
I will not be offended.

981
01:02:14,985 --> 01:02:17,112
Okay.

982
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:19,865
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.

983
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,038
Oh, fuck.

984
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:18,173
Oh, fuck.

985
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:44,324
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.
Unbelievable!

986
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:46,660
Whoo! Boy.

987
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:50,164
Ohh, she is nasty, Miles.

988
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:53,333
Nasty, nasty, nasty!

989
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:56,587
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
- Yeah, baby.

990
01:03:56,712 --> 01:09:27,828
Congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

991
01:04:05,625 --> 01:09:27,863
Oh, hi, Miles!

992
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:08,467
Hi.

993
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:11,958
- Hey, you didn't invite Stephanie
to come with us, did you?

994
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:14,039
Oh, listen, man. Change of plans.

995
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:18,096
Stephanie's off today, so, you know,
I'm thinkin' about goin' on a hike.

996
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,609
We were supposed to play golf.

997
01:04:20,712 --> 01:04:24,077
You know what? You go, man.
You go. In fact, use my clubs.

998
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:27,174
- They're brand-new.
They were a gift from Christine's dad.

999
01:04:27,285 --> 01:04:29,751
Here, I'll pay for it. Right there.

1000
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:33,151
And then later, the three of us,
we can go to The Hitching Post.

1001
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:35,223
We could sit at one of Maya's tables.

1002
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:37,292
She'll bring us some great wine,
you know?

1003
01:04:37,393 --> 01:04:40,791
- Then the four of us will do something.
- No. Count me out.

1004
01:04:40,897 --> 01:04:43,194
Oh, I see.

1005
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,960
Didn't go so great last night, huh?
What a shocker.

1006
01:04:46,068 --> 01:04:49,763
You mean getting drunk and calling
Victoria didn't put you in the mood?

1007
01:04:51,139 --> 01:04:53,731
Dumb fuck.

1008
01:04:53,841 --> 01:04:58,298
- Later, man.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should
check your messages first.

1009
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:10,848
Oh, boy.

1010
01:05:10,956 --> 01:05:13,616
Yeah, she's been leaving
messages here too.

1011
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,060
Yeah. Okay.

1012
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:20,459
- You should call her.
- I will. I'll see you.

1013
01:05:20,564 --> 01:05:23,190
- Right now!
- Okay. Fuck!

1014
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,495
- What are you, my mom?
- Well.

1015
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:37,510
Would you mind waiting outside?

1016
01:05:42,884 --> 01:05:46,147
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah. Good food.

1017
01:05:46,253 --> 01:05:50,312
Hey, I-I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.

1018
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:52,390
You should call her.

1019
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:03,725
- Where's Jack?
- Uh, had to make a phone call.

1020
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,324
Oh.

1021
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,671
Miles. Miles.

1022
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:16,874
Hey, man, uh, do you have
that other condom?

1023
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,345
In my jacket.

1024
01:06:19,448 --> 01:06:21,380
What did, uh, Christine say?

1025
01:06:21,483 --> 01:06:25,713
Lucked out. Got voice mail.
Everything's cool.

1026
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,616
- Ha, ha! Here I am.
- Hi!

1027
01:06:35,629 --> 01:06:37,595
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1028
01:07:25,738 --> 01:07:28,762
Cannonball!

1029
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:31,966
Please dial your password and press pound.

1030
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:38,045
You have no messages at this time.

1031
01:07:38,149 --> 01:07:40,672
To send a message, press 2...

1032
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:14,032
Uh...

1033
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:16,204
Not now. Not now!

1034
01:08:16,315 --> 01:08:20,443
Yeah.

1035
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:33,629
Hey, there you are.

1036
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,196
- Yup.
- Hey, man.

1037
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:38,561
What are you drinking?

1038
01:08:38,668 --> 01:08:40,634
Is it any good?

1039
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:44,068
Can... Can I get a glass, please?

1040
01:08:44,172 --> 01:08:47,139
Thanks.

1041
01:08:47,243 --> 01:08:50,438
Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

1042
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:52,510
God, it was so awesome.

1043
01:08:52,613 --> 01:08:55,910
I think I'm really starting to get
a handle on the whole process.

1044
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:58,574
The soil to the vine, and the...
what do you call it?

1045
01:08:58,685 --> 01:09:00,878
The selection to the harvest.

1046
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:03,954
Then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it?

1047
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,354
It's really neat, the whole thing.

1048
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:09,118
Then we ate pinot grapes
right off the vine.

1049
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:11,284
They were a little sour...

1050
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:14,157
but showing excellent potential
for structure...

1051
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:16,164
down the line, I think.

1052
01:09:16,267 --> 01:09:19,393
Stephanie, man.
She really knows her shit.

1053
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:21,967
Hmm. Where is Stephanie?

1054
01:09:22,073 --> 01:09:25,871
Uh, she's upstairs cleaning up.

1055
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:28,100
What the fuck are you doing?

1056
01:09:29,778 --> 01:09:33,405
- What?
- With this chick.

1057
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:35,776
What?

1058
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,110
Does she know about Saturday?

1059
01:09:38,218 --> 01:09:40,684
Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

1060
01:09:40,788 --> 01:09:42,754
I haven't told her I'm available.

1061
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:45,323
She knows this trip
is only for a few days.

1062
01:09:45,425 --> 01:09:48,085
Besides, I just...

1063
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:52,425
- Besides what?
- I'm... Well, you know...

1064
01:09:52,531 --> 01:09:54,497
- The wedding.
- What?

1065
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:59,499
I... I've just been doing
some thinking about it.

1066
01:09:59,604 --> 01:10:02,400
Oh, you've been thinking. And?

1067
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:09,199
Might have to put
the wedding on hold, is all.

1068
01:10:09,312 --> 01:10:12,768
Look, I know that
that could be tricky...

1069
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:15,905
- for certain people to accept at first.
- Yeah.

1070
01:10:16,018 --> 01:10:18,484
All right?
But life is short, Miles.

1071
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:22,544
I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

1072
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:25,122
You know what?
That's not just for my sake.

1073
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:28,421
I'm looking out
for Christine's feelings too.

1074
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:32,326
I mean, being with Stephanie
has completely opened my eyes.

1075
01:10:32,433 --> 01:10:35,229
She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

1076
01:10:35,335 --> 01:10:38,894
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

1077
01:10:39,005 --> 01:10:40,971
- She fucks different.
- Okay.

1078
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:43,369
She fucks like an animal.

1079
01:10:43,474 --> 01:10:46,600
I gotta tell you, man.

1080
01:10:46,711 --> 01:10:49,837
I went deep last night.

1081
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,845
Deep.

1082
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:54,677
Deep.

1083
01:10:54,785 --> 01:10:58,241
I thought I'd get a little understanding
from you, but I'm not gonna get that.

1084
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,820
Understanding about what, Jack?

1085
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:06,619
I might be in love with another woman.

1086
01:11:06,727 --> 01:11:08,626
In love? Really?

1087
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:12,687
Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer
chick, and you're fuckin' in love.

1088
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,767
Come on! And you're gonna
give up everything?

1089
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:19,971
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

1090
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:23,506
You and me, we move up here,
we buy a vineyard.

1091
01:11:23,608 --> 01:11:27,064
You design the wine.
I'll handle the business side.

1092
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,272
You get inspired, maybe write
another novel, one that can sell.

1093
01:11:30,382 --> 01:11:32,281
Oh, my God. No, no.

1094
01:11:32,384 --> 01:11:34,783
As for me, if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s right there, man.

1095
01:11:34,886 --> 01:11:37,352
- It's two hours away. Not even.
- Jesus Christ. You're crazy.

1096
01:11:37,455 --> 01:11:39,887
You've gone crazy.

1097
01:11:42,858 --> 01:11:45,825
All I know is that I'm an actor.

1098
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:48,555
All I have is my instinct.

1099
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,954
You're asking me to go against it.

1100
01:11:53,068 --> 01:11:56,399
Hi, guys!

1101
01:11:56,504 --> 01:11:59,232
Hi. Hi.

1102
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:02,306
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

1103
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:04,536
Where?

1104
01:12:04,644 --> 01:12:07,611
I know where all the drivers go.

1105
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:12,046
Huh? All right. Here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice.

1106
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:15,050
Nice. Okay, it's the bridge.

1107
01:12:15,153 --> 01:12:18,985
Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.

1108
01:12:21,526 --> 01:12:24,493
You know, it's a thing... I mean,
I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?

1109
01:12:24,596 --> 01:12:27,256
- Mm-hmm.
- Stephanie's heard this a thousand times...

1110
01:12:27,365 --> 01:12:30,696
but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance...

1111
01:12:30,801 --> 01:12:33,734
I would've made a fortune
when they put in that, uh...

1112
01:12:33,835 --> 01:12:35,926
- Home Depot.
- Home Depot.

1113
01:12:36,037 --> 01:12:38,868
And those stores.
And your father knew about it too.

1114
01:12:38,975 --> 01:12:40,874
He's such a fuckin' chickenshit.

1115
01:12:40,976 --> 01:12:44,671
Always was.
Just a fuckin' chickenshit.

1116
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:47,109
Just too scared.

1117
01:12:47,214 --> 01:12:50,181
- Is this bothering you? You sure?
- It's fine. Yeah.

1118
01:12:52,919 --> 01:12:55,886
Hey, man. I'm gonna just make sure
that Siena and Stephanie get home safe.

1119
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:58,456
- Okay.
- All right. Maybe we'll hook up with you later.

1120
01:12:58,557 --> 01:13:01,023
Sure. Whatever. Maybe I'll
go catch a movie or something.

1121
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,992
- See you later, Miles.
- Thanks, Stephanie. See you.

1122
01:13:04,096 --> 01:13:05,995
- Bye, Siena.
- Bye.

1123
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:08,497
- Caryl, very nice meeting you.
- I loved talking with you.

1124
01:13:08,598 --> 01:13:12,463
- Thanks.
- If you go out later, call me on my cell.

1125
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,196
Okay!

1126
01:13:26,814 --> 01:13:29,440
- Okay. That's it?
- Yeah.

1127
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:33,316
Actually, could I get a, uh...
a Barely Legal, please?

1128
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:36,980
Thank you. No, actually...
Sorry. The new one.

1129
01:13:37,089 --> 01:13:38,988
Okay.

1130
01:13:40,127 --> 01:13:42,093
Thanks.

1131
01:14:02,278 --> 01:14:04,904
What... Oh.

1132
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:56,178
- Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?
- Hey.

1133
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:59,383
Oh, you know me. I love it up here.

1134
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,462
- How 'bout you?
- Busy for a Tuesday night.

1135
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:05,292
We had a busload of old folks
on a wine tour.

1136
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:08,366
Usually they're not too rowdy,
but tonight something was going on.

1137
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:11,436
I don't know. A full moon or something.
Anyway, what can I get you?

1138
01:15:11,537 --> 01:15:14,265
- Highliner.
- Glass or bottle?

1139
01:15:14,374 --> 01:15:17,569
- Bottle.
- You got it.

1140
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:19,975
Say, is, uh, Maya working?

1141
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,376
Maya? Uh, no, I haven't seen her.

1142
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:25,779
I think she's off tonight.

1143
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:40,761
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1144
01:16:18,563 --> 01:16:21,325
Ah, crap.

1145
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:24,160
- Did you ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
- Nope.

1146
01:16:24,267 --> 01:16:26,166
- Hmm?
- No.

1147
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:28,931
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie'll tell you.

1148
01:16:29,038 --> 01:16:31,664
- Could you just give me a little room? Please?
- Yeah.

1149
01:16:31,773 --> 01:16:33,672
Thank you.

1150
01:16:33,775 --> 01:16:37,231
In life, you gotta strike
while the iron's hot. Iron is hot.

1151
01:16:37,345 --> 01:16:39,971
Sage advice, Jack.

1152
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,809
- Now, remember, sit back on your heels.
- Mm-hmm.

1153
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:46,281
All right?
Turn through the abdomen.

1154
01:16:46,387 --> 01:16:48,853
Abdomen.

1155
01:16:48,956 --> 01:16:51,582
- Oh, for cryin'...
- Nice.

1156
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,156
What about your agent?
You hear anything yet?

1157
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,193
- Nope.
- What do you think's going on?

1158
01:16:57,295 --> 01:17:00,262
- Could be anything.
- You been checking your messages?

1159
01:17:00,364 --> 01:17:03,024
- Obsessively.
- Huh.

1160
01:17:03,135 --> 01:17:06,159
Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss off
another three years of my life.

1161
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:08,463
But you haven't heard anything yet...

1162
01:17:08,572 --> 01:17:12,131
so don't you think your negativity's
a little premature?

1163
01:17:12,242 --> 01:17:16,141
Hmm? All right. You know,
fuck the New York publishers.

1164
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:18,711
Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in.

1165
01:17:18,813 --> 01:17:21,644
Just get it out there.
Get it reviewed.

1166
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:25,048
Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.

1167
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,981
Don't come over the top.

1168
01:17:33,092 --> 01:17:35,285
- Stay still.
- Shut up.

1169
01:17:36,394 --> 01:17:38,986
It's all about stillness.

1170
01:17:39,099 --> 01:17:42,533
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

1171
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:45,430
Jesus Christ, man!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1172
01:17:45,537 --> 01:17:49,369
Please, just shut up! Fuck!

1173
01:17:49,473 --> 01:17:51,770
- God.
- What's with the hostility, man?

1174
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,433
I know you're a little frustrated
with your life right now...

1175
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:58,310
but you can choose to be less hostile.

1176
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,439
The fucker hit into us.

1177
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:07,214
Hurry it up, will ya?

1178
01:18:07,322 --> 01:18:10,653
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1179
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:14,453
Hey, that's not cool, asshole!

1180
01:18:26,404 --> 01:18:29,371
Nice shot. Jackoffs.

1181
01:18:29,474 --> 01:18:33,636
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oops. Look out.

1182
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:37,875
Uh? Uh-huh.

1183
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:41,608
Oh. Oh, check it out.

1184
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:45,015
- This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.
- Go to it.

1185
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,385
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool, smart
chicks like that require persistence.

1186
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,965
I don't wanna talk about it, please.

1187
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,694
All I know is that she's beautiful,
a lot of soul.

1188
01:19:02,802 --> 01:19:04,768
She's perfect for you.

1189
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:08,134
I'm just not gonna feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

1190
01:19:08,242 --> 01:19:11,971
Don't you want to feel that cozy little box
grip down on your johnson?

1191
01:19:12,078 --> 01:19:14,944
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

1192
01:19:15,048 --> 01:19:17,413
A woman finds out how I live...

1193
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:20,880
that I'm not a published author,
that I'm a liar, essentially...

1194
01:19:20,984 --> 01:19:24,543
any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.

1195
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:28,283
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not even in the game anymore.

1196
01:19:28,392 --> 01:19:31,985
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

1197
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:36,051
- Abattoir. What is that?
- Slaughterhouse.

1198
01:19:36,165 --> 01:19:39,189
Abattoir. Huh.
But you know what?

1199
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,266
You are gonna be
a published author...

1200
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,599
because you're gonna get the good news
this week about your book.

1201
01:19:44,706 --> 01:19:48,299
I know you are. I can feel it.

1202
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:50,307
Huh. Stephanie.

1203
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:53,172
Hey, honey. Yeah.

1204
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:55,745
Yeah. Yeah.

1205
01:19:55,848 --> 01:19:57,747
Yeah!

1206
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,443
- Hey.
- Hi.

1207
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:13,123
Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped by
the restaurant to see me last night.

1208
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,561
Oh, yeah. No. I mean, uh, yeah.

1209
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:18,293
I stopped by for a drink.
I didn't see you.

1210
01:20:18,402 --> 01:20:20,301
- I had class.
- Oh.

1211
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:23,029
Well, nice to see you now.

1212
01:20:23,138 --> 01:20:25,104
It's good to see you too.

1213
01:20:33,448 --> 01:20:36,643
Syrah.

1214
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:40,549
Oldest Syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.

1215
01:20:40,654 --> 01:20:43,815
Did you know that?

1216
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:45,947
You didn't know that?

1217
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,152
The pinot noir grape
has been cultivated perhaps...

1218
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:54,629
since antiquity in Burgundy.

1219
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:57,427
And it is precisely this ancient...

1220
01:20:57,535 --> 01:21:00,798
and inherited winemaking
knowledge...

1221
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:03,463
that has contributed to its success.

1222
01:22:06,828 --> 01:22:09,159
- I was, like, 16, 17.
- Really?

1223
01:22:09,262 --> 01:22:11,387
Yeah. I'm gonna die!

1224
01:22:11,499 --> 01:22:13,931
- Oh, God. What a drag.
- Mom?

1225
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:15,933
- Oh.
- Oh, hey. Hi.

1226
01:22:16,035 --> 01:22:19,002
Is it too loud?

1227
01:22:19,104 --> 01:22:22,731
Sorry. Oh, Uncle Jack
will put you back to bed.

1228
01:22:22,842 --> 01:22:24,808
Come here, little sister. Ooh!

1229
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:27,877
We'll be more quiet, okay?

1230
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:31,935
- Good night. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1231
01:22:32,049 --> 01:22:35,447
My favorite, as far as ice cream...

1232
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:36,218
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey!

1233
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,517
- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey!

1234
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:05,372
You guys should come by
the restaurant for lunch today.

1235
01:25:05,481 --> 01:25:08,937
- Great. What's the latest we can get there?
- About 2:30.

1236
01:25:12,052 --> 01:25:14,848
Did you hear about this Bordeaux
tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara...

1237
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:16,853
on Saturday night?

1238
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:21,086
It's kind of pricey,
but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it.

1239
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:23,660
Why don't you just stay
for the weekend?

1240
01:25:23,763 --> 01:25:26,958
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

1241
01:25:27,066 --> 01:25:29,032
What rehearsal dinner?

1242
01:25:30,435 --> 01:25:32,334
Who's getting married?

1243
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:36,598
- Were you ever gonna say anything?
- Yes, of course I was.

1244
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:39,174
Just now I could've told you
some story, but I didn't.

1245
01:25:39,277 --> 01:25:43,142
- I told you the truth. Maya!
- Don't touch me!

1246
01:25:43,247 --> 01:25:45,213
Just take me home.

1247
01:25:46,815 --> 01:25:49,338
Do you have any idea
what he's been saying to her?

1248
01:25:49,451 --> 01:25:53,146
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

1249
01:25:53,256 --> 01:25:57,384
How she's the only woman that's ever
rocked his world, how he adores Siena...

1250
01:25:57,492 --> 01:26:01,790
how he wants to move here and
get a place with the two of them
and commute when he has to.

1251
01:26:01,896 --> 01:26:04,624
I'm sure he believed every word of it.

1252
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:07,062
Please believe me.

1253
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:10,065
I was on the verge
of telling you last night, but...

1254
01:26:10,171 --> 01:26:13,263
But you wanted to fuck me first.

1255
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:17,203
Oh, Maya. No.

1256
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:19,208
Yeah.

1257
01:26:30,354 --> 01:26:33,947
You know, I've just spent
the last three years of my life...

1258
01:26:34,057 --> 01:26:38,321
trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception...

1259
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:40,393
and I'm doing just fine.

1260
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:46,891
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce...

1261
01:26:47,003 --> 01:26:49,970
so this has been a big deal for me,
Maya.

1262
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:54,335
Hanging out with you and, uh...
and last night.

1263
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:57,773
I really like you, Maya...

1264
01:26:57,877 --> 01:27:01,333
and I am not Jack.

1265
01:27:01,447 --> 01:27:04,414
I'm... I'm...

1266
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:08,712
I'm his freshman year roommate
from San Diego State.

1267
01:27:33,808 --> 01:27:36,775
There's my boy!

1268
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:39,843
There he is.
But who's your daddy?

1269
01:27:39,948 --> 01:27:42,744
- Who is your daddy? Oh!
- Jack, come on.

1270
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:45,408
- Oh, let me love you.
- Let go. Oh!

1271
01:27:45,518 --> 01:27:48,314
Let me down, Jack.

1272
01:27:48,421 --> 01:27:51,388
I am so proud of you.
Ah. Mmm. Mmm.

1273
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:54,082
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. All right. Details.

1274
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:57,124
- I love details.
- No.

1275
01:27:57,229 --> 01:28:01,094
- What?
- Jesus. It's private.

1276
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:04,324
You better tell me what happened,
or I'll tie your dick in a knot.

1277
01:28:04,435 --> 01:28:07,732
Let's just leave it, okay?

1278
01:28:07,837 --> 01:28:12,294
You didn't get any, did you?

1279
01:28:12,408 --> 01:28:15,534
- You're a homo.
- Yeah, right. Yup, I'm a homo.

1280
01:28:15,645 --> 01:28:17,544
Yeah. Yeah.

1281
01:28:17,646 --> 01:28:20,875
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened.

1282
01:28:20,982 --> 01:28:23,949
Write out my gay confession,
and I'll sign it.

1283
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:27,713
Okay? Just stop pushing me
all the time.

1284
01:28:27,821 --> 01:28:29,878
You're an infant, Jack.

1285
01:28:29,989 --> 01:28:33,320
- This is all a big party for you...
- Okay.

1286
01:28:33,427 --> 01:28:35,758
- but not for me.
- Come on.

1287
01:28:35,861 --> 01:28:37,827
I'm sorry, man.

1288
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:41,730
Did you have trouble performing?

1289
01:28:43,768 --> 01:28:47,327
Yeah, that's it.

1290
01:28:47,438 --> 01:28:50,405
Don't answer it.

1291
01:28:50,508 --> 01:28:52,407
Don't answer it.

1292
01:28:52,509 --> 01:28:55,907
- Jack.
- Hello.

1293
01:28:56,012 --> 01:28:58,774
Yeah.

1294
01:28:58,881 --> 01:29:01,178
Uh-huh. It's Christine.

1295
01:29:01,283 --> 01:29:05,581
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1296
01:29:05,686 --> 01:29:07,652
Hey, let me call you right back.

1297
01:29:07,757 --> 01:29:10,451
Miles and I are kinda
in the middle of something.

1298
01:29:10,559 --> 01:29:15,050
Nah, it's nothing serious. Just...
He's having one of his freak-outs. Yeah.

1299
01:29:15,162 --> 01:29:18,926
I love you too. I'll call you back.

1300
01:29:19,031 --> 01:29:23,261
This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn't gone the way it was supposed to.

1301
01:29:23,368 --> 01:29:26,597
I just want to go home.

1302
01:29:27,973 --> 01:29:30,040
I know what you need.

1303
01:29:30,042 --> 01:29:30,735
I know what you need.

1304
01:29:30,842 --> 01:29:33,308
How 'bout this one?
We didn't hit this one.

1305
01:29:33,412 --> 01:29:35,970
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

1306
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:40,377
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1307
01:30:15,313 --> 01:30:17,939
It tastes like the back
of a fucking L.A. school bus.

1308
01:30:18,049 --> 01:30:20,481
Now, they probably didn't de-stem...

1309
01:30:20,585 --> 01:30:23,051
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

1310
01:30:23,153 --> 01:30:25,450
Crushed it up with leaves and mice...

1311
01:30:25,556 --> 01:30:29,354
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1312
01:30:29,459 --> 01:30:31,425
Fuckin' Raid.

1313
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:34,950
Tastes pretty good to me.

1314
01:30:35,064 --> 01:30:38,190
Hmm. Look.
They have a reserve pinot.

1315
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,062
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

1316
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:44,500
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.
- Okay.

1317
01:30:48,275 --> 01:30:50,241
Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

1318
01:30:50,342 --> 01:30:53,332
- Hi, Jennifer. It's Miles again.
- Oh, hi, Miles.

1319
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,347
- Hi.
- Let me see if I can get her.

1320
01:30:55,448 --> 01:30:57,414
Okay.

1321
01:30:57,516 --> 01:31:00,813
- You're in luck. I'll put you through.
- Okay.

1322
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:05,614
- Hi, Miles.
- Hi, Evelyn.

1323
01:31:05,722 --> 01:31:07,621
It's your favorite client.

1324
01:31:07,724 --> 01:31:10,350
- How's the trip?
- Oh, it's good, it's good.

1325
01:31:10,462 --> 01:31:13,156
You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

1326
01:31:13,264 --> 01:31:15,730
- It's very nice.
- Right.

1327
01:31:15,832 --> 01:31:18,492
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

1328
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:20,590
Well, actually, there is word.

1329
01:31:20,703 --> 01:31:23,169
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman
this morning.

1330
01:31:23,271 --> 01:31:25,170
Right. And?

1331
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:27,796
And... they're passing.

1332
01:31:29,478 --> 01:31:33,810
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.

1333
01:31:33,914 --> 01:31:37,973
They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.

1334
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:41,143
He said it was a really tough call.

1335
01:31:42,721 --> 01:31:44,620
Oh. Right.

1336
01:31:44,722 --> 01:31:47,348
I'm sorry, Miles.

1337
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:49,653
So I don't know where that leaves us.

1338
01:31:49,761 --> 01:31:54,321
I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.

1339
01:31:54,432 --> 01:31:58,526
I think it's one of those unfortunate cases
in the business right now...

1340
01:31:58,635 --> 01:32:02,660
a-a fabulous book with no home.

1341
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:05,501
The whole industry's gotten gutless.

1342
01:32:05,609 --> 01:32:08,269
It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.

1343
01:32:08,377 --> 01:32:10,570
It's only about the marketing.

1344
01:32:15,049 --> 01:32:18,847
- Excuse me. Could I get
a, uh, pour down here, please?
- Sure.

1345
01:32:18,952 --> 01:32:22,885
There's a, uh, special
on the Syrah by the case.

1346
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:26,091
Hit me again.

1347
01:32:30,129 --> 01:32:32,095
Thanks.

1348
01:32:33,532 --> 01:32:35,998
Excuse me.
Could you just pour me a full glass?

1349
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:38,067
I'll pay for it, okay?

1350
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:43,036
Sir, this is a winery, not a bar.

1351
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,265
Oh. Come on.

1352
01:32:45,376 --> 01:32:47,968
Just give me a full goddamn pour.

1353
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,771
Excuse me.

1354
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:55,337
Why don't you buy a bottle,
then go outside?

1355
01:32:58,755 --> 01:33:01,722
- What are you doing?
- I told you I need a drink,
so I'm going to help myself.

1356
01:33:01,822 --> 01:33:04,221
- Okay, pal? What do you think?
- Put the glass down.

1357
01:33:04,324 --> 01:33:06,790
Let go of the fucking glass, fucker!

1358
01:33:12,831 --> 01:33:15,491
Mmm.

1359
01:33:15,602 --> 01:33:19,900
- That's that.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.

1360
01:33:20,005 --> 01:33:21,971
- It's okay.
- Get him out of here.

1361
01:33:22,074 --> 01:33:25,872
- Thanks a lot!
- It's okay. His, uh... His mother just died.

1362
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:32,847
So you'll write another one.
You've got lots of ideas, right?

1363
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:35,509
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer.

1364
01:33:35,619 --> 01:33:38,142
I'm a middle school English teacher.

1365
01:33:39,589 --> 01:33:42,055
Ah, the world doesn't give a shit
what I have to say.

1366
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,125
I'm unnecessary.

1367
01:33:45,227 --> 01:33:49,025
I'm so insignificant,
I can't even kill myself.

1368
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:51,596
Miles, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1369
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,599
Come on, man. You know.

1370
01:33:53,702 --> 01:33:56,863
Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.

1371
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:59,937
You can't kill yourself
before you've even been published.

1372
01:34:02,608 --> 01:34:06,406
- What about the guy that wrote
Confederacy Of Dunces?

1373
01:34:06,512 --> 01:34:11,037
He committed suicide before he
was published. Look how famous he is.

1374
01:34:12,883 --> 01:34:14,782
Thanks.

1375
01:34:17,288 --> 01:34:22,087
Just don't give up. All right?
You're gonna make it.

1376
01:34:22,192 --> 01:34:24,715
Half my life is over...

1377
01:34:24,828 --> 01:34:28,784
and I have nothing
to show for it, nothing.

1378
01:34:28,898 --> 01:34:32,332
I'm a thumbprint
on the window of a skyscraper.

1379
01:34:32,434 --> 01:34:36,390
I'm a smudge of excrement
on a tissue...

1380
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,632
surging out to sea
with a million tons of raw sewage.

1381
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,434
See? Right there.

1382
01:34:43,544 --> 01:34:46,067
Just what you just said?
That is beautiful.

1383
01:34:46,179 --> 01:34:49,806
"A smudge of excrement
surging out to sea."

1384
01:34:49,915 --> 01:34:53,041
- Yeah.
- I could never write that.

1385
01:34:53,152 --> 01:34:56,119
Neither could I, actually.
I think it's Bukowski.

1386
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:24,738
Hey, baby.

1387
01:35:26,214 --> 01:35:28,680
- Look what I got for our favorite girl.
- Motherfucker!

1388
01:35:28,783 --> 01:35:33,411
- Jesus Christ!
- You fucking lying piece of shit!

1389
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:37,613
You're getting married on Saturday?
What's with all that shit you said to me?

1390
01:35:37,724 --> 01:35:40,190
- Stephanie, stop!
- I can explain!

1391
01:35:40,292 --> 01:35:42,918
- You said you loved me!
- I do!

1392
01:35:43,027 --> 01:35:46,188
- I hope you die!
- Stop it, Stephanie!

1393
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:57,797
Fuckface! You too!

1394
01:35:57,907 --> 01:35:59,395
Me?

1395
01:36:01,777 --> 01:36:04,437
- You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
- No, I did not.

1396
01:36:04,547 --> 01:36:06,513
No, I did not.

1397
01:36:06,614 --> 01:36:09,046
It must have been Gary
at The Hitching Post.

1398
01:36:09,149 --> 01:36:11,615
I think we mentioned it to him
the first night.

1399
01:36:11,721 --> 01:36:15,280
Oh, did we mention it?
You mentioned it, asshole!

1400
01:36:15,389 --> 01:36:17,981
I'm fucking hurting over here.

1401
01:36:18,092 --> 01:36:20,081
Keep it elevated.

1402
01:36:24,896 --> 01:36:28,852
No, I don't want anything.

1403
01:36:33,571 --> 01:36:35,799
Uh, it's Miles.

1404
01:36:35,906 --> 01:36:40,863
I had to call and, uh, tell you again...

1405
01:36:40,977 --> 01:36:43,274
how much I enjoyed
our time together...

1406
01:36:43,379 --> 01:36:46,312
and, uh, how sorry I am...

1407
01:36:46,417 --> 01:36:49,384
that things turned out
the way they did.

1408
01:36:50,986 --> 01:36:54,784
I think you're great, Maya.

1409
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:58,846
Uh, I always have from the first time
that you, uh, waited on me.

1410
01:37:01,328 --> 01:37:04,693
Uh, and while I'm at it...

1411
01:37:04,799 --> 01:37:08,460
uh, I guess maybe you
should know that my book...

1412
01:37:08,568 --> 01:37:11,831
is not getting published.

1413
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:15,894
I thought this one, uh, had a chance,
but I was wrong again.

1414
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:19,800
Once again.

1415
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:22,672
So you see, uh...

1416
01:37:22,781 --> 01:37:25,907
I'm not really much of a writer.

1417
01:37:26,017 --> 01:37:28,984
I am not much of anything, really.

1418
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:44,886
I'm gonna have to have an operation,
maybe even a couple of 'em.

1419
01:37:44,999 --> 01:37:48,296
They're gonna wait for my nose to heal first,
then they break it again.

1420
01:37:48,402 --> 01:37:51,597
Oh, Christ. Good thing
you have a voice-over career.

1421
01:37:51,704 --> 01:37:55,399
It's gonna fuck that up too.
I oughta sue her ass.

1422
01:37:55,508 --> 01:37:57,997
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.

1423
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,339
- That's thoughtful.
- Yeah.

1424
01:38:04,448 --> 01:38:07,006
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?

1425
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,416
We didn't get into that with Gary.

1426
01:38:11,322 --> 01:38:14,517
Huh. That's... Yeah, let me think.

1427
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:19,253
- You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
- Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.

1428
01:38:19,362 --> 01:38:22,386
And just what are you implying, Jack?

1429
01:38:22,498 --> 01:38:26,159
I'm really pissed off at you about all this,
if you want to know the truth.

1430
01:38:26,268 --> 01:38:30,327
What is Maya going to think of me now,
just for associating with you?

1431
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:37,400
I don't know. Sure seems fishy.

1432
01:38:37,512 --> 01:38:39,535
Well.

1433
01:38:39,645 --> 01:38:44,136
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat...

1434
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,376
I'll be there.

1435
01:38:46,485 --> 01:38:49,680
Wherever there's a cop
beating up a guy...

1436
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:52,620
I'll be there.

1437
01:38:52,725 --> 01:38:56,181
I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.

1438
01:38:56,294 --> 01:38:58,260
What's this look like to you?

1439
01:38:59,864 --> 01:39:03,229
Uh, it looks like you were
in a bad car accident.

1440
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:08,530
When the people
are eating the stuff they raised...

1441
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,071
I'm hungry.

1442
01:39:14,509 --> 01:39:17,271
Here we go.

1443
01:39:17,379 --> 01:39:20,312
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1444
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:23,939
- And here is your Handi Wipes.
- Oh.

1445
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:28,644
So that's what those are. For a minute
I thought you were promoting safe sex.

1446
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,688
That's a good one.
I'll have to remember that one.

1447
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:34,985
- I'll be right back with your corn bread.
- All righty.

1448
01:39:38,563 --> 01:39:41,029
Bet you that chick's two tons of fun.

1449
01:39:41,132 --> 01:39:43,758
- You know, the grateful type?
- Mm-mmm.

1450
01:39:43,869 --> 01:39:46,234
I don't know.
I wouldn't know about that.

1451
01:39:49,906 --> 01:39:51,872
Mmm.

1452
01:39:53,176 --> 01:39:55,075
- Hmm.
- Here you go.

1453
01:39:56,811 --> 01:39:59,505
Nice technique there... Cammi.

1454
01:39:59,613 --> 01:40:02,580
Thank you. All in the wrist.

1455
01:40:02,685 --> 01:40:05,481
You know,
you look really familiar to me.

1456
01:40:05,587 --> 01:40:08,816
- Are you from around here?
- Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?

1457
01:40:08,924 --> 01:40:12,449
I don't know.
You just seemed really familiar to me.

1458
01:40:12,558 --> 01:40:15,787
- Never mind. Enjoy your meal.
- Hang on. Hang on.

1459
01:40:15,895 --> 01:40:19,624
Um, did you ever know
a Derek Sommersby?

1460
01:40:19,733 --> 01:40:24,031
Dr. Derek Sommersby
from One Life To Live?

1461
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:29,803
Just have to imagine him
with a bandage and shorter hair.

1462
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:36,341
No way!

1463
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:39,175
No way! Oh, my gosh!

1464
01:40:39,282 --> 01:40:43,215
That's great! Oh, my goodness!

1465
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:45,785
Could you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

1466
01:40:45,888 --> 01:40:49,515
Oh, yeah. It's right over there,
right past the buffalo. Wow!

1467
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:53,650
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
you're sitting at my table.

1468
01:41:19,149 --> 01:41:22,378
Listen, man, Cammi gets off
in an hour, so I was thinking...

1469
01:41:22,485 --> 01:41:25,452
I'd just hang around, have a drink.

1470
01:41:25,555 --> 01:41:29,114
You know, make sure she gets home safe.

1471
01:41:29,226 --> 01:41:32,125
You're joking, right?

1472
01:41:32,228 --> 01:41:34,751
No.

1473
01:41:34,863 --> 01:41:36,762
Un-fucking-believable.

1474
01:41:36,865 --> 01:41:42,300
Can't we just go back to the motel
and hang out...

1475
01:41:42,403 --> 01:41:45,461
get up early,
play nine holes of golf...

1476
01:41:45,572 --> 01:41:47,538
before we head home?

1477
01:41:51,443 --> 01:41:54,410
Listen, man, you're my friend...

1478
01:41:54,513 --> 01:41:57,480
and I know you care about me.

1479
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:00,243
I know you disapprove,
and I respect that.

1480
01:42:00,351 --> 01:42:05,013
But there are some things that I have to do
that you don't understand.

1481
01:42:05,124 --> 01:42:09,923
You understand literature,
movies, wine...

1482
01:42:10,027 --> 01:42:12,493
but you don't understand my plight.

1483
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:34,571
Yeah?

1484
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:38,012
- Holy shit! Jesus Christ!
- Fuck. Fuck.

1485
01:42:38,117 --> 01:42:41,380
God, it's fucking freezing out there!

1486
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:44,455
- God, yeah.
- Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin?

1487
01:42:44,556 --> 01:42:46,522
Uh...

1488
01:42:49,094 --> 01:42:52,084
Oh.

1489
01:42:52,196 --> 01:42:54,095
Here.

1490
01:42:54,197 --> 01:42:56,096
Oh. Oh.

1491
01:42:59,603 --> 01:43:01,900
Fucking chick's married, man.

1492
01:43:02,005 --> 01:43:04,302
What?

1493
01:43:04,406 --> 01:43:06,895
Her husband works the night shift, and he
comes home and catches me on the floor...

1494
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:09,101
with my cock in his wife's ass.

1495
01:43:09,211 --> 01:43:13,167
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus. Jack!

1496
01:43:13,281 --> 01:43:16,612
- And you walked all the way from Solvang?
- No, ran.

1497
01:43:16,718 --> 01:43:18,684
Twisted my ankle too.

1498
01:43:18,785 --> 01:43:21,980
- That's five klicks, Jack.
- Fuckin'-A right, it's five klicks.

1499
01:43:22,089 --> 01:43:25,181
At one point I had to cut
through an ostrich farm.

1500
01:43:25,292 --> 01:43:28,589
Those fuckers are mean.

1501
01:43:35,101 --> 01:43:37,067
Whoo!

1502
01:43:39,136 --> 01:43:42,968
- Oh!
- We gotta go back.

1503
01:43:43,073 --> 01:43:45,939
What?

1504
01:43:46,042 --> 01:43:49,237
We gotta go back. I left my wallet.

1505
01:43:49,344 --> 01:43:51,310
Credit cards, cash, my fucking I.D.

1506
01:43:51,415 --> 01:43:53,881
- Everything. We gotta go back.
- Big deal. It's fine.

1507
01:43:53,982 --> 01:43:57,177
Don't worry about it. We'll call now
and we'll cancel your cards.

1508
01:43:57,285 --> 01:44:00,116
No, Miles, you don't understand.
The wedding rings.

1509
01:44:00,221 --> 01:44:02,120
The wedding rings are in my wallet.

1510
01:44:02,223 --> 01:44:07,157
Fine, they're in your wallet, and you
left your wallet in some bar, okay?

1511
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,852
- Christine will understand.
- She had to order them special.

1512
01:44:09,964 --> 01:44:11,863
It took her forever to find 'em.

1513
01:44:11,965 --> 01:44:16,127
They've got this design of dolphins
and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

1514
01:44:16,236 --> 01:44:19,795
We gotta go back, man.
Christine will fucking crucify me, Miles.

1515
01:44:19,905 --> 01:44:21,928
No way, no way, no way.

1516
01:44:22,039 --> 01:44:24,028
Please. Please!

1517
01:44:24,142 --> 01:44:27,405
Forget it.
Your wallet was stolen in some bar.

1518
01:44:27,513 --> 01:44:30,480
- It happens every day.
- No, we gotta go back and get my wallet, Miles.

1519
01:44:30,581 --> 01:44:34,242
I'm telling you,
those rings are irreplaceable.

1520
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:37,478
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.

1521
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:39,552
- But you've gotta help me.
- Yeah.

1522
01:44:39,655 --> 01:44:43,248
You've gotta help me, Miles,
please! Please!

1523
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:45,656
I can't lose Christine, Miles.

1524
01:44:45,761 --> 01:44:48,421
I just... I can't.
I can't lose Christine.

1525
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:50,723
- Mm-hmm.
- I know I fucked up.

1526
01:44:50,832 --> 01:44:54,731
I know I did a bad thing, all right?
And I know I'm a bad person.

1527
01:44:54,835 --> 01:44:59,269
I know I am. But you gotta help me!
You have to help me, Miles.

1528
01:44:59,372 --> 01:45:02,828
Okay? Tell me you'll help me.

1529
01:45:02,942 --> 01:45:05,704
If I lose Christine, I-I-I...

1530
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:07,901
I'm nothing.

1531
01:45:08,013 --> 01:45:11,447
I just have... I'm nothing.

1532
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:13,573
God.

1533
01:45:13,684 --> 01:45:16,116
- Did she tell you she was married?
- Yeah.

1534
01:45:16,219 --> 01:45:18,185
So what the fuck were you thinking?

1535
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:21,849
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6:00.
Fucker rolls in at 5:00.

1536
01:45:21,958 --> 01:45:24,982
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

1537
01:45:25,093 --> 01:45:27,390
- This is the block.
- You sure?

1538
01:45:27,497 --> 01:45:29,463
Yeah.

1539
01:45:32,867 --> 01:45:34,766
That's it. That's it.

1540
01:45:34,868 --> 01:45:36,834
That's the one right there.

1541
01:45:36,939 --> 01:45:39,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1542
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:41,106
Okay.

1543
01:45:43,176 --> 01:45:48,634
All right.
Okay, so what's the plan?

1544
01:45:48,747 --> 01:45:51,236
Uh, the plan is...

1545
01:45:51,349 --> 01:45:53,248
you go.

1546
01:45:53,353 --> 01:45:56,411
- Me?
- 'Cause of my ankle.

1547
01:45:56,521 --> 01:45:59,488
Still hurts. Just go explain
the situation, Miles.

1548
01:45:59,591 --> 01:46:02,183
Explain the situation. Yes.

1549
01:46:02,293 --> 01:46:06,557
"Excuse me, sir. My friend was the one
balling your wife a couple of hours ago.

1550
01:46:06,662 --> 01:46:09,788
"Really sorry. He seems to
have left his wallet behind.

1551
01:46:09,899 --> 01:46:12,866
I was wondering if I could come in
and just poke around. I don't know."

1552
01:46:12,969 --> 01:46:16,095
- Yeah, just like that. That's good.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

1553
01:46:19,107 --> 01:46:22,802
Oh, fuck it! I'll go.
I guess I have to do everything.

1554
01:46:22,911 --> 01:46:26,401
No. Hold on.

1555
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:15,437
You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now.

1556
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:18,667
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl!

1557
01:48:18,776 --> 01:48:21,265
You picked him up and you fucked him,
didn't you, bitch?

1558
01:48:21,379 --> 01:48:25,074
Yeah, I picked him up and I fucked him.
I'm a bad girl!

1559
01:48:25,182 --> 01:48:27,842
You liked fucking him,
didn't you, you little whore?

1560
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:32,112
I liked it when you caught me fucking him!
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!

1561
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:34,120
You are a bad bitch.

1562
01:48:34,223 --> 01:48:36,689
- Yeah, you caught me.
- You're such a whore.

1563
01:48:36,792 --> 01:48:39,123
Oh, yeah!

1564
01:48:39,227 --> 01:48:42,023
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, it's so good!

1565
01:48:44,199 --> 01:48:46,098
I fucked him.

1566
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,429
- You're so bad.
- I am. Yeah.

1567
01:48:51,538 --> 01:48:55,267
You are such a whore.

1568
01:48:55,376 --> 01:48:59,901
- What the fuck!
- The wallet! He's got Derek's wallet!

1569
01:49:00,012 --> 01:49:02,911
I think they
were surprised by the level of protest...

1570
01:49:03,014 --> 01:49:05,742
that was really happening
within the company.

1571
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:10,784
The injustice may be their plan,
and they said, "Well, we cant just go..."

1572
01:49:10,888 --> 01:49:14,787
- Oh! Here's your wallet! Oh, shit!
- Motherfucker!

1573
01:49:14,891 --> 01:49:17,357
Open the goddamn door!

1574
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:19,427
- I'm gonna kill your ass!
- You got it! You got my wallet!

1575
01:49:19,528 --> 01:49:24,327
I'll find you! I will find you, bub!
I'll find your ass!

1576
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:27,558
You're mine, man! You're mine!

1577
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:30,296
Fuck you! I'm gonna get your ass!

1578
01:50:01,332 --> 01:50:05,960
- You wanna let me drive?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

1579
01:50:06,068 --> 01:50:09,524
Hey, you know, you oughta
invite Maya to the wedding.

1580
01:50:09,639 --> 01:50:11,538
Hmm.

1581
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,402
Somehow I think
inviting Maya to the wedding...

1582
01:50:14,508 --> 01:50:17,566
is not the right move
at this juncture.

1583
01:50:17,678 --> 01:50:19,577
I don't know.

1584
01:50:19,681 --> 01:50:21,647
In fact,
after all of your shenanigans...

1585
01:50:21,749 --> 01:50:24,773
it's gonna be hard for me
to ever go to The Hitching Post again.

1586
01:50:24,884 --> 01:50:27,851
You know, there was a nice way
to respond to that.

1587
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:31,411
- Come on. Let me drive.
- No, I got it. You should rest.

1588
01:50:31,523 --> 01:50:34,389
You know what? I feel like driving.

1589
01:50:34,492 --> 01:50:36,391
Okay.

1590
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:39,657
Uh... hey, put on your seat belt, okay?

1591
01:50:39,765 --> 01:50:42,096
I was just about to.
What's the problem?

1592
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,657
- Just want to remind you to be safe.
- We missed the entrance.

1593
01:50:46,771 --> 01:50:49,397
What are you doing, Jack?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1594
01:50:49,506 --> 01:50:51,972
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on.

1595
01:50:52,074 --> 01:50:54,371
Jack!

1596
01:50:54,479 --> 01:50:56,378
What the fuck!

1597
01:50:56,479 --> 01:50:59,310
- You said it looked like an accident.
- What the fuck!

1598
01:50:59,414 --> 01:51:01,313
I'll pay for it.

1599
01:51:01,416 --> 01:51:06,373
Jesus. Christ, Jack!
Oh, for Ch... Look at this!

1600
01:51:06,488 --> 01:51:09,922
- Huh.
- Oh.

1601
01:51:10,022 --> 01:51:11,921
I don't know.

1602
01:51:12,025 --> 01:51:15,754
Doesn't look like anyone
was injured in this one.

1603
01:51:15,862 --> 01:51:17,761
No. No.

1604
01:51:17,864 --> 01:51:20,490
- Watch your head.
- Yeah.

1605
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,795
Boy, you broke a couple of 'em,
you know.

1606
01:51:23,902 --> 01:51:26,869
- Whatever. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not "whatever."

1607
01:51:26,971 --> 01:51:29,563
You fuckin' derelict.

1608
01:51:29,675 --> 01:51:31,574
You ready?

1609
01:51:31,675 --> 01:51:34,836
Just get it over with.

1610
01:52:15,647 --> 01:52:19,809
Okeydoke. All right.

1611
01:52:19,916 --> 01:52:22,747
Well, I guess that's about it.

1612
01:52:22,853 --> 01:52:27,584
- Want to come inside?
- Uh, no. No, you're on your own.

1613
01:52:28,925 --> 01:52:31,551
All right. I guess
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

1614
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:33,627
Yup.

1615
01:52:34,930 --> 01:52:37,123
I love you, man.

1616
01:52:37,232 --> 01:52:39,597
Yeah. Back at ya.

1617
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:44,156
- Miles, don't drive away until they see the car.
- I know, I know, I know.

1618
01:52:44,271 --> 01:52:47,102
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?

1619
01:52:47,206 --> 01:52:50,662
'Cause you were wearing your seat belt.

1620
01:52:53,178 --> 01:52:55,144
Nicely done.

1621
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:17,799
- Hi.
- Jack.

1622
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,799
- Yeah.
- Uh, Christine, Mike!

1623
01:54:08,411 --> 01:54:10,377
Amen.

1624
01:55:32,948 --> 01:55:35,847
Hey, Miles.

1625
01:55:35,951 --> 01:55:40,408
Hi, Vicki.
Wow, you look beautiful.

1626
01:55:40,523 --> 01:55:42,422
Thanks.

1627
01:55:42,523 --> 01:55:45,217
Um, this is Ken Cortland,
my husband.

1628
01:55:45,326 --> 01:55:47,225
- How are you?
- How are you?

1629
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:49,317
- Good, thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.

1630
01:55:49,429 --> 01:55:52,827
- You're a lucky guy.
- Yes, I am. Thank you.

1631
01:55:52,932 --> 01:55:54,989
Yeah.

1632
01:55:55,102 --> 01:55:58,001
Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.

1633
01:55:58,105 --> 01:56:01,072
- It was great meeting you, Miles.
- Ken.

1634
01:56:04,809 --> 01:56:08,402
- Well, that was big of him.
- Yeah, he's good that way.

1635
01:56:08,513 --> 01:56:12,446
- He's very considerate.
- That's great.

1636
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:14,949
So how are you doing?

1637
01:56:15,052 --> 01:56:17,814
Since the last time we spoke?
I don't know.

1638
01:56:17,921 --> 01:56:21,218
Could be better. Could be worse.

1639
01:56:21,325 --> 01:56:25,850
- So what's happening with your book?
- Um, universally rejected.

1640
01:56:25,961 --> 01:56:30,089
- Strike three.
- Oh, Miles, that's awful.

1641
01:56:30,199 --> 01:56:32,893
What are you gonna do?

1642
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:36,230
Back to the drawing board,
I guess. Or not.

1643
01:56:36,337 --> 01:56:38,963
I don't know.

1644
01:56:39,073 --> 01:56:42,040
So, anyway, you're married.

1645
01:56:42,142 --> 01:56:45,371
Congratulations. You look happy.

1646
01:56:45,477 --> 01:56:47,876
- I am.
- Good.

1647
01:56:47,982 --> 01:56:50,710
Seems like everybody's getting married.

1648
01:56:50,817 --> 01:56:54,716
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.

1649
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:57,787
- Cyclical, I guess.
- I guess.

1650
01:57:03,225 --> 01:57:06,351
Well, uh, what do you say
we hit the reception?

1651
01:57:06,463 --> 01:57:09,487
Have some champagne,
toast the newlyweds, huh?

1652
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:11,498
Not me. I'm not drinking.

1653
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:15,694
You quit drinking. Really?

1654
01:57:15,805 --> 01:57:17,771
I'm pregnant.

1655
01:57:19,706 --> 01:57:21,672
I see.

1656
01:57:23,044 --> 01:57:25,510
Yes, I see. Great.

1657
01:57:27,614 --> 01:57:30,581
Well, congratulations again, Vicki.

1658
01:57:30,683 --> 01:57:33,582
Boy, that's wonderful news.

1659
01:57:35,321 --> 01:57:37,947
- See you over there, Miles?
- Yeah.

1660
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:44,128
Hmm.

1661
01:59:49,803 --> 01:59:53,362
"'The marrow of his bone, '
I repeated aimlessly.

1662
01:59:53,472 --> 01:59:55,938
"This, at last, penetrated my mind.

1663
01:59:56,042 --> 01:59:59,066
"Phineas had died
from the marrow of his bone...

1664
01:59:59,176 --> 02:00:02,473
"flowing down his bloodstream
to his heart.

1665
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:05,843
"I did not cry then or ever about Finny.

1666
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:09,145
"I did not cry even when I stood...

1667
02:00:09,252 --> 02:00:13,050
"watching him being lowered into
his family's straitlaced burial ground...

1668
02:00:13,156 --> 02:00:15,055
"outside of Boston.

1669
02:00:15,158 --> 02:00:18,614
"I could not escape the feeling
that this was my own funeral...

1670
02:00:18,727 --> 02:00:22,320
and you do not cry in that case."

1671
02:00:22,431 --> 02:00:25,557
Should I keep reading
the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

1672
02:00:25,666 --> 02:00:29,464
Uh, no, no.
We'll pick up there Monday.

1673
02:01:16,511 --> 02:01:19,377
One new message.

1674
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:23,608
Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

1675
02:01:23,716 --> 02:01:26,182
Thanks for your letter.

1676
02:01:26,285 --> 02:01:28,274
I-I would have called sooner...

1677
02:01:28,387 --> 02:01:31,354
but I think I needed some time to think
about everything that happened...

1678
02:01:31,457 --> 02:01:34,913
and what you wrote to me.

1679
02:01:35,027 --> 02:01:37,721
Another reason, um,
I didn't call you sooner...

1680
02:01:37,828 --> 02:01:41,284
is because I wanted to finish your book,
which I finally did last night.

1681
02:01:41,399 --> 02:01:44,423
And I think it's really lovely, Miles.

1682
02:01:44,534 --> 02:01:47,000
You're so good with words.

1683
02:01:47,103 --> 02:01:49,569
Who cares
if it's not getting published?

1684
02:01:49,672 --> 02:01:53,902
There are so many beautiful
and... painful things about it.

1685
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:57,972
Did you really go through all that?

1686
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,706
Must have been awful.

1687
02:02:00,815 --> 02:02:05,749
And the sister character...
geez, what a wreck.

1688
02:02:05,854 --> 02:02:10,311
But I have to say that, well,
I was really confused by the ending.

1689
02:02:10,424 --> 02:02:13,880
I mean, did the father
finally commit suicide, or what?

1690
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:15,959
It's driving me crazy.

1691
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:20,655
Anyway...

1692
02:02:20,765 --> 02:02:24,664
it's turned cold and rainy here lately...

1693
02:02:24,769 --> 02:02:27,395
but I like winter.

1694
02:02:27,505 --> 02:02:32,304
So, listen, if you ever do decide to come
up here again, you should let me know.

1695
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:35,206
I would say stop by the restaurant,
but to tell you the truth...

1696
02:02:35,312 --> 02:02:37,778
I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be working there...

1697
02:02:37,879 --> 02:02:39,970
because I'm going to graduate soon.

1698
02:02:40,082 --> 02:02:42,605
So I'll probably want to relocate.

1699
02:02:42,718 --> 02:02:44,684
I mean, we'll see.

1700
02:02:46,154 --> 02:02:50,110
Anyway, like I said,
I really loved your novel.

1701
02:02:50,225 --> 02:02:55,125
Don't give up, Miles.
Keep writing.

1702
02:02:55,228 --> 02:02:57,194
I hope you're well.

1703
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,466
Bye.
