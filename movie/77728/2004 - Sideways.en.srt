1
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,211
Fuck.

2
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:51,123
- Yeah.
- Miles, can you move your car, please?

3
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,727
- Why?
- The roofers gotta get the truck in.

4
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:56,202
- You didn't park too good, okay?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,284
All right, hold on.

6
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,772
Sorry.

7
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,003
Sorry, gentlemen.

8
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:23,289
Sorry.

9
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,004
Oh, fuck me!

10
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,812
I know I said I would be there
by noon.

11
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:01,767
But there's all this work
going on at my building...

12
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,322
...and it's just a total nightmare.

13
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,565
And I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning.

14
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,485
But I'm on my way.

15
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:12,167
I'm out the door right now.

16
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,683
Hi, Simon. Triple espresso, please.

17
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:32,645
- For here?
- No, actually I'm late.

18
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:37,409
<i><b>Make it to go. And give me a
New York Times and a spinach croissant.</b></i>

19
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:38,847
Thank you.

20
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,523
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?

21
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,288
- Thank you very much. Jack still here?
- Yes.

22
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:04,244
- Look what the cat dragged.
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.

23
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,165
Somebody finally arrived.

24
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,011
Finally got here, Mr. Prompt.

25
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,971
- Remember my kids, Alex, Helen?
- Yes, hi, how are you?

26
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,089
We thought you went the wrong way.

27
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,687
You went to Tijuana and
they don't let you back.

28
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:19,766
Yes, yes, I had to bribe them.

29
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:23,050
- Hey, Miles.
- How are you, Christine?

30
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,206
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

31
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:30,366
Bumper-to-bumper the whole way. People
getting an early start on the weekend.

32
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:34,526
- Granted, I got a late start.
- We're just glad you made it.

33
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:36,649
Christine, ask Miles about the cake.

34
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:39,043
- Good idea. Come with me.
- What's this?

35
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,922
- Honey, we don't have time for that.
- It's just gonna take a second.

36
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,049
Yeah.

37
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:50,443
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.

38
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:52,649
Yes, congratulations.

39
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:56,408
Yes, well, it's not exactly finalized yet.

40
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,929
- But there has been some interest.
- Your friend is modest.

41
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,093
Come on, Miles, don't be so modest.
Indulge them.

42
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:06,251
- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What's the subject?

43
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,968
- Non-fiction?
- No, it's a novel. Fiction.

44
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,522
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life.

45
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:16,447
So I suppose that, technically,
some of it is non-fiction.

46
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:20,811
Good. I like non-fiction. There is
so much to know about this world.

47
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:24,568
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

48
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,892
- It's an interesting perspective.
- So which one do you like better?

49
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:33,011
I like them both, but
if pressed, I would have to say...

50
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,084
...that I prefer the dark.

51
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,971
Told you.

52
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,648
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

53
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,365
Bye.

54
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:57,004
Bye. Where the fuck were you, man?

55
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,482
I was dying. We're supposed
to be miles away.

56
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,484
- I can't help the traffic.
- Come on.

57
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,809
You're fucking hung-over.
You know you are.

58
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,726
Okay, there was a tasting
last night. Yes.

59
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,168
I wanted to get us something
for the ride.

60
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,607
Check out the box.

61
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,761
Why did you say
my novel was being published?

62
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,606
- You said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't.

63
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:20,368
No, no. What I said was that
there was some interest at Conundrum.

64
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:24,202
And that one of the editors was
passing it up to a senior editor.

65
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:27,962
- Sounds good. Sounds like you're in.
- No. It's a long shot.

66
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:32,251
And besides, Conundrum, it's just
a small specialty press.

67
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:35,610
I'm not gonna get my hopes up,
you know. I've stopped caring.

68
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:38,333
The hell with it. I have stopped caring.

69
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,690
It sounds like it's gonna happen
this time. I can feel it.

70
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,809
I think this is the one.

71
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:45,770
I'm really proud of you, man.

72
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,163
No, don't open that now.
No, no, it's warm.

73
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:50,568
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.

74
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,088
It's really rare, okay?
I've been saving it.

75
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:55,721
- I won't open it.
- Please, don't open it!

76
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,811
Jack! Half of it, gone!

77
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:02,130
Hey. Shut up, okay?

78
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:05,046
Here's to a great week.

79
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:06,931
Come on.

80
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,603
Yes. Absolutely.

81
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,888
Despite your crass behavior, I'm glad
we're getting this time together.

82
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:16,771
Yeah. Me too.

83
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:20,967
I've been looking forward to this.
I thought it was never gonna happen.

84
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,646
Man, that's tasty.

85
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:26,562
That's 100 percent Pinot Noir.
They don't even make it anymore.

86
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,372
Pinot Noir?
Then how come it's white?

87
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,924
Don't ask questions like that up at wine
country, they'll think you're a dumb shit.

88
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,446
Just tell me.

89
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,367
Color in red wines comes from the skins.

90
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:43,163
This juice, on the other hand, is free-run.
So that there's no skin content...

91
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,885
Did you read the latest draft?

92
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,850
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- And?

93
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:53,091
It's great. I mean, it's...
So many improvements.

94
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,562
Much tighter. It just seems...

95
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,850
...I don't know, more congealed
or something.

96
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,322
What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

97
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,765
Oh, yeah. New ending
vastly superior to the old ending.

98
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,406
There is no new ending.

99
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:10,565
Page 750 on is exactly the same.

100
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:17,603
Well, maybe it just seemed new because
everything leading up to it was different?

101
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,282
Yeah, that must be it.

102
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,928
- Why are we getting off?
- I just wanna make one quick stop.

103
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,653
- For what?
- I thought we'd say hello to my mother.

104
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:32,725
- Your mother?
- Look, it's her birthday tomorrow, okay?

105
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:35,453
I don't feel right driving by
and not stopping in.

106
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,613
It'll take a second.
She's right off the freeway.

107
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:42,412
I didn't know.
How old is she gonna be?

108
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,928
Seventy-something.

109
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,322
Here. Hold this for just a second.

110
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,571
Thank you.

111
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,207
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

112
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,045
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

113
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:28,365
Oh, my God! Miles and Jack!

114
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,491
What a surprise!

115
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:35,568
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers.

116
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:38,492
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- They're from both of us.

117
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:43,773
A famous actor bringing me
flowers for my birthday!

118
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,447
- Don't I feel special!
- And champagne.

119
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:48,922
The famous actor's
getting married next week.

120
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:52,369
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice?

121
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:55,809
I hope that girl
knows how lucky she is.

122
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:59,682
Marrying no less
than Derrick Sommersby.

123
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,447
That was like 11 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

124
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:05,650
Well, you were wonderful
in that show.

125
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:11,683
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin.

126
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:15,085
Now, Miles, why didn't
you tell me you were coming...

127
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,086
...and bringing this handsome man?

128
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:19,851
Look how I'm dressed.

129
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:23,642
- I gotta run and put my face on.
- You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

130
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,132
Oh, stop it!

131
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,807
Make yourselves comfortable.

132
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:31,488
- You boys hungry?
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

133
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:35,005
Just a snack.

134
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:48,165
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond,
absolutely delicious.

135
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,689
- They're just leftovers.
- Is this chicken?

136
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:55,209
I could have made something fancier
if someone had let me know...

137
00:10:55,373 --> 00:11:00,163
...that a certain someone was coming
for a visit and bringing a special friend.

138
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,652
It was a surprise, Mom.

139
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:06,489
And I could have already put clean
sheets on the other bed and the foldout.

140
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:09,167
You are staying.
Wendy, Ron and the twins...

141
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,689
...are picking us up at 11:30
to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

142
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:15,367
They do a magnificent job there.

143
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:16,807
You talked to Wendy?

144
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,042
Just now. She's thrilled.
And the twins.

145
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,090
No, I bet. I bet, yeah.

146
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:27,292
Well, you know,
Jack is pretty eager to get up to...

147
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:33,448
You know, but, yeah, absolutely,
you know, we'll see how it goes.

148
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,009
Well, you boys do what you want.

149
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:42,167
I thought it would be nice for us to
be together as a family on my birthday.

150
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,851
I'll be right back.

151
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:13,288
And what was that other one you did?

152
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,364
The one where you were the jogger?

153
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,764
That was for...
Spray 'n Wash.

154
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:21,527
- Spray 'n Wash. That's the one.
- Gosh.

155
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,765
I remember the girl that was in it.
She was something.

156
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:29,286
I just remember you jogging.

157
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:32,290
So when's the wedding?

158
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,683
Next Saturday, Mom, remember?
We told you.

159
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,209
And Miles is my best man,
Mrs. Raymond. My main man.

160
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:41,809
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?

161
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,363
I just got divorced, Phyllis.

162
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,603
Two years ago, buddy.

163
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,526
You should get back together
with Victoria.

164
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,207
She was good for you.

165
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,648
She was good for you...

166
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,964
...and so beautiful, and so intelligent.

167
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,452
You knew her, right?

168
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:05,690
Oh, yeah, real well. Still do.

169
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,409
I'm worried about you, Miles.

170
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,804
Do you need some money?

171
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,568
Jack.

172
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:24,327
Jack, come on.

173
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,773
Jack, no, no, no. She'll wake up.

174
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:11,450
Fuck. Too early in the morning
for that, you know what I mean?

175
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:14,723
She's a kid, for God's sake.

176
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,527
As if she would even be
attracted to guys like us.

177
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:23,006
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking
at me all the time, all ages. Dudes too.

178
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,773
It's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.

179
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:29,045
- It's never free.
- You need to get laid, Miles.

180
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:32,606
That's gonna be my best man gift
to you this week.

181
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,889
- I'm gonna get you laid.
- Wonderful.

182
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:39,490
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate,
penknife or any of that other horseshit.

183
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,604
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.

184
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,566
You've been officially depressed
for like two years.

185
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,372
You're a negative guy anyway.
Even back in college.

186
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,047
And now it's worse.
You're wasting away...

187
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:54,565
...teaching English to eighth-graders when
they should be reading what you wrote.

188
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,451
- Your books.
- I'm working on it.

189
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,012
Not working hard enough.

190
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:01,372
- You still seeing that shrink?
- I saw him on Monday.

191
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:04,212
I spent most of the time
helping with his computer.

192
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,608
Well, I say fuck therapy.

193
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,684
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?

194
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:11,771
- And Lexapro, yes.
- Well, I say fuck that too.

195
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,889
You need to get your joint worked on.

196
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,169
Jack, Jack...

197
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,323
...this week is not about me,
it is about you.

198
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,852
I'm gonna show you a good time.

199
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:27,130
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
play some golf...

200
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,568
...eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery...

201
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:33,521
<i><b>...and we're gonna send you
off in style, mon frère.</b></i>

202
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,049
And get your bone smooched.

203
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,252
You know what, let's take
the Santa Rosa Road exit...

204
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,608
...and hit Sanford first, okay?

205
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:00,082
Sounds good to me. I need a drink.

206
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:02,363
They make top-notch
Pinot and chardonnay.

207
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,649
One of the best producers
in the county.

208
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:08,123
- I thought you hated chardonnay.
- No, no. I like all varietals.

209
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,569
I don't like the way they manipulate
chardonnay in California.

210
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:15,612
Too much oak and secondary
malolactic fermentation.

211
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,443
You see, the reason that this
region is so good for Pinot...

212
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,730
...is that the cold air off the
Pacific flows in at night...

213
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,049
...and it just cools down the berries.

214
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:27,886
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape.

215
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:31,489
It doesn't like constant heat
or humidity. Very delicate.

216
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,288
Let me show you
how this is done. First...

217
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:40,771
...hold the glass up and examine
the wine. Look for color and clarity.

218
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,572
Just get a sense of it, okay?

219
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,725
Thick, thin, watery, syrupy?

220
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:48,606
- Okay?
- Okay.

221
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,525
Now, tip it.

222
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,566
What you're doing is checking
for color density...

223
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,371
...as it thins towards the rim.

224
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,731
That's gonna tell you how old it is.
It's usually more important with reds.

225
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:02,489
Now, stick your nose in it.

226
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:08,249
Don't be shy. Really get your nose
right in there. Really...

227
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:12,289
A little citrus.

228
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,809
Maybe some strawberry.

229
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:18,008
Passion fruit.

230
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:24,085
And there's just, like, the faintest
soupçon of, like, asparagus...

231
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:30,442
...and there's just a flutter of, like,
a nutty Edam cheese.

232
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,086
Wow.

233
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,966
- Strawberries, yeah. Strawberries.
- Good.

234
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,612
Not the cheese.

235
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,963
Put your glass down,
get some air into it.

236
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:44,682
Oxygenating it opens it up.
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.

237
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:47,765
Very important. Smell again.

238
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,883
That's what you do
with every one of them.

239
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:54,283
- When do we drink it?
- Now.

240
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,689
How would you rate this one, Miles?

241
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,131
Usually they start you on wines
with learning disabilities.

242
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,171
But this one is pretty good.
This is the new one, right?

243
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,051
Just released two months ago.

244
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,642
- Nice job.
- We like it.

245
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:20,012
- You could work in a wine store, Miles.
- Yeah. That'd be a good move.

246
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,771
Are you chewing gum?

247
00:19:58,453 --> 00:20:01,604
You think I'm making a mistake
marrying Christine?

248
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:06,009
Do you think I'm doing the right thing?
Tell me the truth.

249
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:08,368
I mean, you've been there.

250
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:12,362
Well, you know, I think that you waited
for some good reason...

251
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:15,411
...and you proposed to Christine
for some good reason.

252
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,882
So I think it's great.

253
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:19,327
It's time.

254
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,371
I mean, you gotta have
your eyes open, that's all.

255
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:26,367
I mean, look at me. You know, I thought
Victoria and I were set for life.

256
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:30,731
Christine's dad has been talking about
bringing me into his property business...

257
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,805
...showing me the ropes,
which is something...

258
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:37,010
...considering how long it took him
to get over my not being Armenian.

259
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:38,606
So I'm thinking about it.

260
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,570
But I don't know.

261
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,610
It might get a little incestuous.

262
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,331
But Mike does great.

263
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,882
- High-end stuff.
- So you're gonna stop acting?

264
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:50,602
No way. No.
This would just provide some stability.

265
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:54,209
I can always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

266
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:57,171
Keep myself in the game in case
something came along.

267
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,289
But we're not getting any younger.

268
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,886
No, no.

269
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,445
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

270
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:12,208
- Miles. Long time no see.
- Sir. Very nice to see you.

271
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:15,524
- Hey, when's your novel coming out?
- Soon, soon.

272
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:18,127
This is my buddy Jack.
He's getting married.

273
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,761
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring?

274
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:24,608
We have got a lot of good stuff.

275
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:27,606
We have the new Bien Nacido,
you want a taste?

276
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:33,365
They make their own wine here,
it's just outstanding. Very special.

277
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,966
So, what do you think?

278
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:45,412
Tighter than a nun's ass.

279
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,928
Good concentration. Nice fruit.

280
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:49,811
Pour us a couple, will you?

281
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:52,123
Yeah, it's tight.

282
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:56,446
There you are, gentlemen.

283
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:59,571
I will leave you the bottle,
and it is good to see you.

284
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:02,012
Hey, man...

285
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:04,403
...here's to my last week of freedom.

286
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,450
It's gonna be great.

287
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:08,365
Here's to us.

288
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,964
Miles, check out that chick.

289
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,972
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.

290
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,003
- You know her?
- Sure I know Maya.

291
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:25,526
- You know that chick?
- Yes.

292
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:29,766
Jack, this is where I eat when I come
up here. It's practically my office.

293
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,447
Occasionally, I have a drink
with the employees.

294
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:36,367
Yeah, Maya's great. She's worked here
like a year, year and a half.

295
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:38,524
- She's incredibly hot.
- Yes, she is.

296
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:42,049
And nice. And married.
Check out the rock.

297
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:43,487
That doesn't mean shit.

298
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,167
At Sushi Roku,
Christine wore an engagement ring...

299
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,244
...to keep guys from hitting on her.

300
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:51,246
You think it worked? No.
How do you think I met her?

301
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:56,407
This gal is married to some philosophy
professor at UC Santa Barbara.

302
00:22:56,573 --> 00:23:00,088
What's a professor's wife doing
waitressing? Obviously that's over.

303
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,528
You don't know anything
about this woman.

304
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:05,924
Calm down. Let's just eat.

305
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:10,564
- Oh, hey, Miles.
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

306
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,007
How are you?

307
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:14,443
I'm good. I'm good.

308
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,571
You look great,
did you lose some weight?

309
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:22,891
No, actually, but thank you.
Busy night, huh?

310
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,852
Sunday.

311
00:23:25,013 --> 00:23:28,403
- You guys been out tasting?
- You know it, you know it.

312
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,529
This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.

313
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:32,684
- Hiya.
- Hi.

314
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,491
Well, it's good to see you.

315
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,611
- Bye, Miles.
- Back to work.

316
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:42,407
Jesus, she's jamming.

317
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:44,484
And she's obviously into you.

318
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,689
What else do you know about her?

319
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:49,162
Well, she does know a lot about wine.

320
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:52,369
Now we're getting somewhere.

321
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:55,366
- She likes Pinot.
- Perfect.

322
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,842
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton, Jack.

323
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,605
How is that ever gonna work?

324
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,883
Why do you have to focus
on the negative?

325
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:05,563
- You see how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

326
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,130
You're blind, dude. Blind.

327
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:13,684
I can also recommend the ostrich steak,
very lean, locally raised.

328
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:18,891
Hey, Gary.

329
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,850
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

330
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:23,846
- That's on us.
- Oh, hey, guys.

331
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:25,366
- Do you mind?
- No, no.

332
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:28,252
- You sure?
- Please, light up.

333
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,931
In fact, would you like to join us?

334
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,125
Sure.

335
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:44,287
How's that book coming?

336
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:46,842
You were almost finished
last time we talked.

337
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:48,605
I finished it.

338
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:51,004
Good for you.

339
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:53,492
It's getting published.

340
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:56,611
That's actually why
we're up here celebrating.

341
00:24:57,813 --> 00:25:00,373
Well, congratulations, that's fantastic.

342
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,649
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

343
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,607
Are you a writer too?

344
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:07,923
No, Maya, I'm an actor.

345
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,962
Really, what kind of stuff?

346
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:15,206
A lot of TV. You know, I used to be
a regular on a couple of series.

347
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:18,570
But lately it's been
a lot of commercial work.

348
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,086
Nationals mostly.

349
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:21,647
Anything I might know?

350
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,566
Perhaps. Do you recognize this?

351
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:29,410
Now with the low, low 5.8 percent
APR financing.

352
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:32,326
That's hilarious, you sound
like one of those guys.

353
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:33,972
- I am.
- You are not.

354
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,805
He is.

355
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:39,522
Consult your doctor before using.
Side effects may include...

356
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:41,604
...hives, loss of appetite.

357
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:46,528
If you have diabetes or a history of
kidney trouble, you're dead, asshole!

358
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,647
So, what are you guys up to tonight?

359
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:53,292
We're pretty wiped.

360
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:58,163
You know, I think we're just gonna
go back to the motel and crash.

361
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,485
Yeah, I guess it's kind
of a long drive up here.

362
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:06,611
- Where are you staying?
- The Windmill.

363
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,491
Windmill.

364
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:13,811
The girl is looking to party and you tell
her we're going to the motel and crash?

365
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,885
- Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired, Jack. Aren't you tired?

366
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,611
The chick digs you, man.

367
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:22,482
She lit up when she found out
your novel was getting published.

368
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:25,326
Now I have another lie to live down.
Thanks, Jack.

369
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:30,089
Just trying to get you a little action.
I would appreciate a little bit of help.

370
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:33,768
It didn't seem like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

371
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:36,083
Well, somebody had to do the talking.

372
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:39,245
And by the way, I was right.
She's not married.

373
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:40,971
- How do you know?
- No rock.

374
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:45,206
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

375
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:08,649
What's the plan for today, Miles?

376
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:15,049
Good. We head up north,
begin the grape tour up there.

377
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:19,092
Work our way south,
so that the more we drink...

378
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:21,005
...the closer we get to the motel.

379
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:27,087
What's your problem?

380
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,492
What is it?

381
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,446
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles.

382
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:43,526
And you are not gonna fuck it up
for me with all of your depression...

383
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:47,686
...and anxiety, and nag-head,
downer shit.

384
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:51,726
Well. Now the cards are on the table.

385
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:53,645
Yes, they are.

386
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:57,091
And I am serious.
Do not fuck with me, Miles.

387
00:27:57,413 --> 00:28:01,691
I'm going to get laid before I get
married on Saturday, do you read me?

388
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:06,842
Sure, big guy, absolutely.
Loud and clear, whatever you're saying.

389
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,487
It's your party, evidently.

390
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:14,773
Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

391
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,685
No, Miles.

392
00:28:16,853 --> 00:28:21,165
This is our week to get crazy.
We should both be cutting loose.

393
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,922
This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.

394
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:28,568
It's something we should share.

395
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:03,651
- This is our syrah.
- Okay.

396
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,772
- Yeah? Like that?
- That's a big one.

397
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:21,647
It did sit with the skins for two weeks
in an open-top tank.

398
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:24,168
Okay, that would explain
all the tannins, no?

399
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:28,167
Well, it's a young wine. So as
the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.

400
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,086
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

401
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,729
Fill up there, bub.

402
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,364
This is our estate chardonnay.

403
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,570
There's a girl that knows
how to pour. What's your name?

404
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,210
- Stephanie.
- Stephanie.

405
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,045
Nice.

406
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:15,087
- So, what do you think?
- Quaffable, but far from transcendent.

407
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:17,687
I like it. Tastes great.

408
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:20,925
- Oaky.
- Cabernet franc.

409
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,693
This is the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

410
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:26,651
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

411
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:28,292
It's from Santa Maria.

412
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:33,050
And it was a silver-medal winner
at Paso Robles last year.

413
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:40,482
I will tell you, I've come never to expect
greatness from a cab franc.

414
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,052
This one is no different.

415
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:45,523
It's kind of a hollow, flabby,
overripe...

416
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:50,244
I don't know, tastes pretty good to me.
So do you live around here, Stephanie?

417
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,051
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.

418
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:54,010
I agree with you about cab franc.

419
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:56,850
We're just over in Buellton.

420
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,447
- Windmill Inn.
- Oh, yeah?

421
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,253
Do you happen to know
a gal named Maya?

422
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:05,450
- Yeah, sure. Yeah, I know Maya.
- Yeah? No shit.

423
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,366
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

424
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,444
Can we move on to the syrah, please?

425
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:13,851
Chomping at the bit, huh? Sure.

426
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,131
This is our estate syrah.

427
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:23,924
You are a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

428
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:27,444
I know, I need to be spanked.

429
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:29,849
Excuse me.

430
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,172
Syrah?

431
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:46,482
- Hey. Hey. Get the trunk.
- You have the keys.

432
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,803
I do? In my pocket.

433
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,850
- So we're on.
- What?

434
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:55,245
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not
working tonight, so we're all going out.

435
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,971
- With...? With Maya?
- Yeah.

436
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:59,931
She's been divorced
a year now, buddy.

437
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:04,212
This chick Stephanie,
she's got it all going on.

438
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:06,250
Well, she is cute.

439
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:10,326
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you
almost tell her I'm getting married?

440
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:11,972
What's the matter with you?

441
00:32:23,373 --> 00:32:25,933
- Nice, huh? Yeah.
- It's beautiful.

442
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:29,252
Victoria and I used to like this view.

443
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:33,645
You know, once we had a picnic here,
and we drank a '95 Opus One...

444
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,964
...with smoked salmon and artichokes,
but we didn't care.

445
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:41,649
Oh, man. She has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

446
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:45,647
She could even differentiate
all different kinds of Italian wines.

447
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:49,327
Miles, there's something
I gotta tell you.

448
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:52,124
Victoria's coming to the wedding.

449
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:55,126
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with that.

450
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:58,447
Yeah, but that's not the whole story.

451
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:01,524
She got remarried.

452
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,126
She what?

453
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:06,567
When?

454
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,169
About a month ago.

455
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,005
Maybe six weeks.

456
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:14,766
To that guy? The guy
with the restaurant?

457
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,445
Miles.

458
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,212
Miles.

459
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:31,049
I'd like to go home now.

460
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:35,048
- Miles, get out of the car.
- Would you drive me back to the motel?

461
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:39,251
- You know what?
- She bringing him to the wedding?

462
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,285
What do you think?

463
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:44,968
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

464
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:47,010
I knew you'd get so freaked out...

465
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,209
...that you wouldn't come
on this trip.

466
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:51,688
But this is the perfect place
to tell you.

467
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:55,323
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party.

468
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,164
I'm gonna be a fucking pariah.
Persona non grata.

469
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:03,611
Everybody will be holding their breath
to see if I get drunk and make a scene.

470
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:06,003
No, no. Look.

471
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:10,451
I talked to Victoria, okay?
She's cool. Everybody's cool.

472
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,922
I'm sorry, you've been talking...?

473
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:17,566
Behind my back,
you've been talking about it?!

474
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,205
What are you doing?

475
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,364
Come back here.

476
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:25,406
Miles!

477
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,170
Come here. Give me that bottle.

478
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,166
Back off, Jack. Back off, man!

479
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,211
- Give me that bottle.
- No.

480
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:38,411
Miles.

481
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:41,411
Miles.

482
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:48,812
<i><b>There's a lot of people out there
that think they can make it.</b></i>

483
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:51,328
<i><b>What better thing in life
than to chase the dream...</b></i>

484
00:35:51,493 --> 00:35:53,165
<i><b>... and not be afraid of going after it?</b></i>

485
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:57,050
<i><b>Next play, chance for a birdie.
A five-shot lead.</b></i>

486
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:00,728
I'm gonna go for a swim.
Get the blood flowing.

487
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:04,283
- You wanna come?
- No, I wanna watch this.

488
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:06,445
Okay.

489
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:11,532
<i><b>Start this ball one or two inches
outside the left edge.</b></i>

490
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:20,284
<i><b>- Great putt.
- Absolutely. Great speed.</b></i>

491
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,804
Miles.

492
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,411
Miles.

493
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:32,690
Oh, Miles. Time to get up.

494
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,930
This fucking chick in the Jacuzzi.

495
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:44,690
Oh, dude, this place is wide open.
I'm going fucking nuts up here, man.

496
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,812
Hey, what should I wear?

497
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:49,123
I don't know.
Something casual but nice.

498
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,284
They think you're a writer.

499
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:58,926
Do you have any other shoes?

500
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:13,729
Hey, honey.
Yeah, I was just calling to check in.

501
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:16,004
We're getting ready
to go to dinner...

502
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:18,767
...so I thought I'd say good night now.

503
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:22,285
Yeah. I miss you too.

504
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,451
Yeah. And I love you too.

505
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:29,043
Just try to be
your normal humorous self.

506
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,809
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Remember? People love that guy.

507
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:36,248
Don't forget,
your novel is out in the fall.

508
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:39,291
Oh, really? How exciting.
What's it called?

509
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:42,092
Come here, Miles. Come here.

510
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:47,847
Do not sabotage me.

511
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:51,926
If you wanna be a lightweight,
that's your call, but do not sabotage me.

512
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:55,529
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Lf they wanna drink merlot, we drink it.

513
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:59,481
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I'm not drinking fucking merlot!

514
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:04,249
Okay, okay.
Relax, Miles. Jesus. No merlot.

515
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:06,290
Did you bring your Xanax?

516
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:11,212
All right. Come here.

517
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,012
Do not drink too much,
do you hear me?

518
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,892
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

519
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:19,772
- No going to the dark side.
- Okay.

520
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:27,123
Hi. Just looking for some friends.

521
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:41,127
- Good evening, ladies. How are you?
- How are you?

522
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:43,204
Hello, Maya.

523
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,010
You look gorgeous. You both do.

524
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:49,004
Thank you. Not so bad yourself.

525
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,971
Thanks, thanks.
So, what's good here?

526
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:56,012
- What's this you're drinking?
- This is the Fiddlehead. Sauvignon blanc.

527
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,686
- I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

528
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:00,447
- So, what time did you close up at...?
- Kalyra.

529
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:03,411
- Kalyra.
- Kalyra. Actually I got out of there...

530
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:04,892
...around 5:30, 6.

531
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,964
- Yeah.
- Still some stuff to do.

532
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:11,330
- That's really nice.
- Aged 12 months in oak. French oak.

533
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:14,405
Really? Sauvignon blanc. Interesting.

534
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:16,848
The wine maker
comes into the restaurant.

535
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:21,245
- What do you have to do there to close?
- Close up the register. Clean up...

536
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:24,485
...and put stuff away.
Put the glasses up for the next day.

537
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,008
- Right.
- Just small stuff.

538
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:30,245
- Hints of clove.
- Yes. I know, I love that.

539
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:32,091
Yeah.

540
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,532
- Sorry. It's good.
- No, we'll get you a glass.

541
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:39,287
Now we're thinking. Good.

542
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:43,053
Oh, he can say it
and it's not disgusting.

543
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:47,445
- I didn't hear him say that.
- Whenever I say something he says...

544
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:49,932
Very good.

545
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:52,328
Actually, no, that one, not this one.

546
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,324
I'm having that too.

547
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:59,728
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

548
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:02,401
- That's what I'm saying.
- We have corn chowder.

549
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:04,882
For entrées,
we have medallions of pork...

550
00:40:05,093 --> 00:40:08,324
...dusted with truffles,
with a roux vegetable fleuron...

551
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,524
...and wasabi-whipped potatoes...

552
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:13,602
- You have to explain, like...
- Yes.

553
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:15,843
Miles, what does this remind you of?

554
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:28,001
I mean with the yellow light,
in the glass.

555
00:40:28,173 --> 00:40:31,051
After all, tonight, we are celebrating
Miles' book deal.

556
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:33,483
Published author.

557
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:36,651
- Wow, Miles.
- Well, in that case...

558
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:00,128
It's a traditional way
to deal with wine.

559
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:03,490
It's a controversial way
of dealing with wine.

560
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:06,082
So everyone's going back to that.

561
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:20,728
There's a sort of constant lapping.
It's a fishing lake.

562
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:23,730
Your lips are soft.

563
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:28,122
- Okay.
- Harry is, right? He's in the whole thing.

564
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:30,170
What do they call it...?

565
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:43,522
What the hell am I trying to say?

566
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,452
<i><b>Hello.</b></i>

567
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:20,365
Victoria.

568
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:22,891
<i><b>Miles?</b></i>

569
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:27,446
Well, well, Victoria,
how the hell are you?

570
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,361
<i><b>What's on your mind?</b></i>

571
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:34,685
Oh, nothing, I just heard
that you got remarried.

572
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:39,643
Congratulations. I didn't think you had
the stomach for another go-round.

573
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:41,405
<i><b>Oh, Miles, you're drunk.</b></i>

574
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:47,603
Oh, just a little local Pinot. You know,
a little burgundy, a little Côte de Berne.

575
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,525
<i><b>- Where are you?
- A little place in Los Olivos.</b></i>

576
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:54,412
New owners, cozy ambiance.

577
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:57,884
Excellent food too. You should try it.

578
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:02,487
I thought of you
at the Hitching Post last night.

579
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:05,291
Hello.

580
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:07,171
<i><b>Don 't call me when you're drunk.</b></i>

581
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,450
No, I just wanted to let you know...

582
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:14,322
...that I have decided
not to come to the wedding...

583
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:19,851
...so just in case you were dreading
some sort of, you know, run-in...

584
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:23,608
...or something like that, well,
worry no more. I won't be there.

585
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:27,322
That's my little wedding gift to you
and what's-his-name.

586
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,129
What is his name?

587
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:36,011
<i><b>- Ken.
- Ken. Right. Ken.</b></i>

588
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:41,524
<i><b>- I'm gonna hang up now, Miles.
- You know, it's just, I heard about this...</b></i>

589
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:45,971
...for the first time today.
Your getting remarried, that is.

590
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:50,445
And I was kind of taken aback.

591
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:53,810
Just hard to believe.

592
00:43:56,293 --> 00:44:00,525
I guess I thought maybe there was
still a chance for us...

593
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:03,491
...somewhere down the road,
and I just...

594
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:08,724
<i><b>Miles, maybe it is better if you
don 't come to the wedding.</b></i>

595
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:13,885
Alrighty, Vicky. Whatever you say.

596
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:16,408
You're the boss.

597
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:31,051
Welcome back.

598
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:33,684
Take it easy.

599
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:39,092
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes, I'm fine, thank you.

600
00:44:43,653 --> 00:44:47,168
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Sure.

601
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:55,483
Don't take too long. Okay. Bye, girls.

602
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:57,848
What the fuck! What is up with you?

603
00:44:58,053 --> 00:45:01,329
You remember our little talk outside?
Get your shit together.

604
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:04,405
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Where were you?

605
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:06,411
Bathroom.

606
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:10,049
Did you drink and dial?

607
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:13,328
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

608
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:17,970
Victoria is gone.
Gone, poof. In the wind.

609
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:22,046
I mean, you are blowing
a great opportunity here with Maya.

610
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:25,523
She's great. She's cool, she's funny,
she knows wine.

611
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:28,287
I mean, what is this morose,
comedown bullshit?

612
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:31,963
These girls wanna party with us, huh?

613
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:36,209
And what was that 10-minute lecture
on, what, Vouvrays?

614
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:38,284
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

615
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:41,809
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

616
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,212
Have you forgotten all the bad times
with Victoria?

617
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:47,204
How small she can make you feel?

618
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:49,608
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda?

619
00:45:49,773 --> 00:45:52,082
Shut up. Shut your face. Shut up.

620
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:54,130
Have you noticed how
Maya looks at you?

621
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,563
Now come on, man.
You got her on the hook.

622
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:59,327
Reel her in,
let's ratchet this up a notch.

623
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:03,562
<i><b>Here, drink some agua fría.</b></i>

624
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:09,252
- Hey.
- Hey.

625
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,722
So shall we get some dessert?

626
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:17,762
We were thinking,
why don't we go back to my place?

627
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:21,243
I've got wine, some cheeses,
music, whatever.

628
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:22,868
Yeah.

629
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:27,407
Waiter.

630
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:42,765
Come here.

631
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:47,206
One for you, three for me.

632
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:50,088
You sure you wanna do this?

633
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,649
We're here.

634
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,328
- Hey.
- Where were you guys?

635
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:04,725
We took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.

636
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:06,407
Hi.

637
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:10,289
Oh, Miles, Maya's in the back.
Past the kitchen.

638
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,126
Okay. Thanks.

639
00:47:22,813 --> 00:47:25,725
- Hi.
- Hey.

640
00:47:26,573 --> 00:47:27,972
Has she got anything good?

641
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:31,250
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots
and syrahs.

642
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,244
- Hey, Steph!
- Yeah?

643
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:35,449
Can we really open anything we want?

644
00:47:35,613 --> 00:47:39,162
Yeah, yeah. Anything.
Except the Richebourg.

645
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:41,409
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?

646
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:44,451
Holy mackerel, I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.

647
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:48,049
Oh, good Lord. Look at that.

648
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:53,884
I think this guy's more our speed.

649
00:47:54,293 --> 00:47:57,444
Andrew Murray. Well, okay.

650
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:03,772
So, what gems
do you have in your collection?

651
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,606
It's really not much of a collection,
you know.

652
00:48:06,773 --> 00:48:10,482
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.

653
00:48:10,653 --> 00:48:14,487
I've never had the wallet for that.
I just have to live bottle-to-bottle.

654
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:17,247
I've got things I'm saving. Definitely.

655
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:21,167
The star would be
a 1961 Cheval-Blanc.

656
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:24,332
You've got a '61 Cheval-Blanc
just sitting there?

657
00:48:24,493 --> 00:48:26,211
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.

658
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:29,092
- I'm serious, hurry.
- I would. I would.

659
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,289
The '61 s are peaking now,
aren't they?

660
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:34,411
- At least that's what I've read.
- No, that's right, yeah.

661
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:36,962
It might be too late.
What are you waiting for?

662
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:41,843
Oh, I don't know.
Special occasion with the right person.

663
00:48:42,013 --> 00:48:45,892
It was supposed to be for my 10th
wedding anniversary, but...

664
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:51,411
The day you open a '61 Cheval-Blanc,
that's the special occasion.

665
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,564
So how long have you been into wine?

666
00:48:58,133 --> 00:49:00,408
I got serious about seven years ago.

667
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:04,686
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

668
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:10,212
Congratulations. That's very good.
That would do it. Yeah.

669
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:19,006
Oh, wow. That's nice.
That's very good.

670
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:22,085
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.

671
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:24,084
How about you?

672
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,090
I think they overdid it a little.

673
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:30,483
Too much alcohol,
it overwhelms the fruit.

674
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:42,050
Yeah. Yeah. I'd say you're right
on the money. Very good.

675
00:49:42,253 --> 00:49:45,051
- Nice.
- Thank you.

676
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:48,930
Is that Stephanie's kid?

677
00:49:49,093 --> 00:49:52,130
Yeah, that's Siena.
She's a sweetie.

678
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:55,763
Cute. Cute. Where is she?

679
00:49:56,213 --> 00:50:00,001
At her grandmother's. Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.

680
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:05,527
- You got kids?
- Me? No, I'd just fuck them up.

681
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:11,882
Yeah. That was the one
unpolluted part of my divorce. No kids.

682
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:14,733
- Yeah, same here.
- Good.

683
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:17,284
Let's go in there.

684
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:36,965
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

685
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:40,205
Yeah, you can say that again.

686
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:44,245
So, what's your novel about?

687
00:50:44,413 --> 00:50:46,688
What's my novel...? Oh, brother.

688
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:49,890
Well, it's difficult to summarize.

689
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:54,770
It starts out as
a first-person narrative about a guy...

690
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:57,766
...taking care of his father
after a stroke.

691
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:02,883
And it's kind of based on
personal experience, but only loosely.

692
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:06,090
<i><b>- What's the title?
- The Day After Yesterday.</b></i>

693
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:09,331
Oh, you mean today.

694
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:15,128
Yeah, I mean, right, but it's more...

695
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:18,729
So it's about, like,
death and mortality or...?

696
00:51:18,893 --> 00:51:20,804
Yeah...

697
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:25,803
Yeah, not really. It jumps around a lot.
That's what it's about.

698
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:28,443
You know what I mean?

699
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:33,602
You see everything from the father's point
of view and a lot of other things happen.

700
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:36,333
Parallel narratives. It's kind of a mess.

701
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:40,691
And then, eventually, the whole thing
sort of evolves, or devolves...

702
00:51:40,853 --> 00:51:45,290
...into this sort of Robbe-Grillet mystery,
you know.

703
00:51:45,653 --> 00:51:47,644
But no real resolution.

704
00:51:48,213 --> 00:51:49,692
Wow.

705
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,972
I think it's great
you're getting it published.

706
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:56,563
Really. I mean, I know how hard it is
just to write it, even.

707
00:51:58,053 --> 00:52:00,408
Like me. I've got this paper
due on Friday...

708
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:03,292
...and I'm freaked out about it.
Like in high school.

709
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,966
A paper, huh?

710
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:09,127
Yeah, I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.

711
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,885
Sort of chipping away at it.

712
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:13,851
Horticulture? Really?

713
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:16,853
I didn't even know that there
was a college here.

714
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:20,205
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.

715
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:23,212
Horticulture. Wow.

716
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,365
So do you wanna work in a winery
or something?

717
00:52:26,653 --> 00:52:28,291
Maybe.

718
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,324
So when can I read your book?

719
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:43,842
Well, I do happen to have
a manuscript in my car.

720
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:48,086
It's not proofed or anything. So it's
full of typos, if you don't mind typos.

721
00:52:48,253 --> 00:52:51,882
Oh, no. Who cares?
I'm the queen of typos.

722
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:54,090
Okay.

723
00:53:28,853 --> 00:53:30,222
You know...

724
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,807
Can I ask you a personal question,
Miles?

725
00:53:33,013 --> 00:53:34,332
Sure.

726
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:37,002
Why are you so into Pinot?

727
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:40,406
I mean, it's like a thing with you.

728
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,728
I don't know. I don't know.

729
00:53:45,733 --> 00:53:49,692
It's a hard grape to grow,
as you know, right?

730
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:55,530
It's thin-skinned, temperamental,
ripens early.

731
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:59,083
It's not a survivor like cabernet...

732
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:04,202
...which can just grow anywhere
and thrive even when it's neglected.

733
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:07,729
No, Pinot needs constant care
and attention.

734
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:11,846
In fact, it can only grow in these
really specific...

735
00:54:12,013 --> 00:54:14,447
...little tucked-away corners
of the world.

736
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:21,885
And only the most patient
and nurturing...

737
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:25,011
...of growers can do it, really.

738
00:54:25,973 --> 00:54:32,162
Only somebody who really takes
the time to understand Pinot's potential...

739
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,723
...can then coax it
into its fullest expression.

740
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:38,283
Then, I mean...

741
00:54:38,453 --> 00:54:44,892
Its flavors, they're just the most haunting
and brilliant and thrilling and subtle...

742
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:49,449
...and ancient on the planet.

743
00:54:53,813 --> 00:54:56,407
Now, cabernets can be powerful
and exalting too...

744
00:54:56,573 --> 00:55:01,886
...but they seem prosaic to me for some
reason by comparison. I don't know.

745
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:04,172
What about you?

746
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,369
What about me?

747
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:09,691
I don't know. Why are you into wine?

748
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:16,965
I think I originally got into wine
through my ex-husband.

749
00:55:17,253 --> 00:55:22,247
He had this big, sort of show-off cellar,
you know.

750
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:26,811
But then, I discovered that I had
a really sharp palate.

751
00:55:27,253 --> 00:55:31,883
And the more I drank, the more
I liked what it made me think about.

752
00:55:32,053 --> 00:55:33,486
Like what?

753
00:55:33,653 --> 00:55:35,450
Like what a fraud he was.

754
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:42,488
- No, I like to think about the life of wine.
- Yeah.

755
00:55:42,693 --> 00:55:45,002
How it's a living thing.

756
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:51,522
I like to think about what was going on
the year the grapes were growing.

757
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:53,804
How the sun was shining.

758
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:56,124
If it rained.

759
00:55:57,013 --> 00:56:02,133
I like to think about all the people
who tended and picked the grapes.

760
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:06,804
And if it's an old wine, how many
of them must be dead by now.

761
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,091
I like how wine continues to evolve.

762
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:14,204
Like, if I opened a bottle today...

763
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:18,161
...it would taste different
than if I'd opened it on any other day.

764
00:56:19,613 --> 00:56:22,605
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive.

765
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:28,329
And it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

766
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:31,610
That is, until it peaks.

767
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:34,012
Like your '61.

768
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:41,648
And then it begins
its steady, inevitable decline.

769
00:56:44,813 --> 00:56:48,283
And it tastes so fucking good.

770
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:06,572
Yeah.

771
00:57:07,053 --> 00:57:12,047
You know, I like other wines
besides Pinot too.

772
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:15,011
I don't know. Lately I've been
really into Rieslings.

773
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:17,888
You like Rieslings? Rieslings?

774
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:25,012
- Is the bathroom in the back?
- Through the kitchen.

775
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:26,652
I'll be right back.

776
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:41,889
God, you're such a fucking loser.

777
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:44,613
You make me so fucking sick.

778
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:48,571
Come on.

779
00:58:05,933 --> 00:58:09,164
- Hey.
- I was just getting some water.

780
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,403
You want some water?

781
00:58:12,293 --> 00:58:14,727
It's getting kind of late...

782
00:58:22,973 --> 00:58:24,929
I should really go.

783
00:58:54,693 --> 00:58:57,082
To get to the Windmill,
two rights and a left.

784
00:58:57,253 --> 00:58:59,050
- Got it.
- Okay.

785
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,842
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.

786
00:59:02,213 --> 00:59:04,283
Good. So did I.

787
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:07,809
Okay, well, I'll see you around, then.

788
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:13,407
Did you still want to read my novel?

789
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:16,122
Oh, yeah. Of course.

790
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,528
- Great.
- Just a second.

791
00:59:31,013 --> 00:59:33,891
- Oh, wow.
- Well, I hope you like it.

792
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:36,487
And feel free to stop reading
at any time.

793
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:39,087
I will not be offended.

794
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:40,726
Okay.

795
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:43,488
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.

796
01:00:28,393 --> 01:00:30,111
Oh, fuck.

797
01:01:01,753 --> 01:01:05,746
Fucking chick is unbelievable,
dude, unbelievable.

798
01:01:08,233 --> 01:01:10,303
She's nasty, Miles.

799
01:01:10,473 --> 01:01:13,192
Nasty, nasty, nasty.

800
01:01:13,513 --> 01:01:15,743
Well, glad you got it
out of your system.

801
01:01:15,913 --> 01:01:19,622
- Yeah, baby.
- Congratulations, mission accomplished.

802
01:01:23,593 --> 01:01:26,585
- Oh, hi, Miles.
- Hi.

803
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:30,469
You didn't invite her to come with us,
did you?

804
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,112
Listen, a change of plans.

805
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:36,346
Stephanie's off today, so you know,
thinking about going on a hike.

806
01:01:36,513 --> 01:01:38,549
We were supposed to play golf.

807
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:40,711
You know what? You go, man.

808
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:44,661
Use my clubs. They're brand-new.
They were a gift from Christine's dad.

809
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,222
Here, I'll pay for it.

810
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:51,029
And then later, the three of us,
we can go to the Hitching Post.

811
01:01:51,193 --> 01:01:54,230
Sit at one of Maya's tables.
She'll bring us great wine.

812
01:01:54,393 --> 01:01:56,349
Then the four of us
will do something.

813
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:58,424
No, count me out.

814
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:00,752
Oh, I see.

815
01:02:00,913 --> 01:02:03,381
Didn't go so great last night?
What a shocker.

816
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:07,063
Getting drunk and calling
Victoria didn't put you in the mood?

817
01:02:08,153 --> 01:02:09,711
Dumb fuck.

818
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:13,062
- Later, man.
- Well, maybe you should check...

819
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,110
...your messages first.

820
01:02:26,313 --> 01:02:29,908
- Oh, boy.
- She's been leaving messages here too.

821
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:33,228
Yeah, okay.

822
01:02:33,673 --> 01:02:36,312
- You should call her.
- I will. I'll see you.

823
01:02:36,473 --> 01:02:41,501
- Right now!
- Okay, fuck. What are you, my mom?

824
01:02:50,473 --> 01:02:52,782
Would you mind waiting outside?

825
01:02:57,753 --> 01:03:01,109
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah. Good food.

826
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:05,108
I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.

827
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,143
You should call her.

828
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:17,990
- Where's Jack?
- Had to make a phone call.

829
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:25,031
Miles. Miles.

830
01:03:26,793 --> 01:03:30,103
Hey, man, do you have
that other condom?

831
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,629
In my jacket.

832
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:34,466
What did Christine say?

833
01:03:34,633 --> 01:03:37,830
Lucked out. Got voicemail.
Everything's cool.

834
01:03:39,353 --> 01:03:41,264
- Here I am.
- Hi.

835
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,745
- Ready?
- Yeah.

836
01:04:39,373 --> 01:04:42,126
<i><b>Please dial your password
and press pound.</b></i>

837
01:04:46,213 --> 01:04:51,333
<i><b>You have no messages at this time.

838
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,130
Not now, not now!

839
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:42,572
- Hey, there you are.
- Yep.

840
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,164
What are you drinking?

841
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:48,092
Is it any good?

842
01:05:49,453 --> 01:05:53,366
Can I get a glass, please?
Thanks.

843
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:58,011
Stephanie took me out
to the Pinot fields today, Miles.

844
01:05:58,173 --> 01:05:59,731
God, it was so awesome.

845
01:05:59,893 --> 01:06:03,249
I think I'm really starting
to get a handle on the whole process.

846
01:06:03,413 --> 01:06:05,802
The soil to the vine,
the what-do-you-call-it?

847
01:06:05,973 --> 01:06:08,009
The selection to the harvest?

848
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,802
Then that thing they do with
the big containers where they mix it.

849
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:13,372
Neat, the whole thing.

850
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:16,001
And then we ate Pinot grapes
right off the vine.

851
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:20,883
They were a little sour, but showing
excellent potential for structure...

852
01:06:21,053 --> 01:06:22,611
...down the line, I think.

853
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:26,730
Stephanie, man, she really
knows her shit.

854
01:06:26,893 --> 01:06:28,292
Where is Stephanie?

855
01:06:28,453 --> 01:06:31,684
She's upstairs getting cleaned up.

856
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:34,085
What the fuck are you doing?

857
01:06:35,613 --> 01:06:36,841
What?

858
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,330
- With this chick?
- What?

859
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:43,529
Does she know about Saturday?

860
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:45,285
Well, not exactly.

861
01:06:45,453 --> 01:06:48,092
I've been honest, I haven't told her
I'm available.

862
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:50,528
She knows this trip is only
for a few days.

863
01:06:50,693 --> 01:06:52,524
Besides, I just...

864
01:06:53,373 --> 01:06:54,965
Besides what?

865
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:59,012
- Well, you know, the wedding?
- What?

866
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:04,205
I've just been doing
some thinking about it.

867
01:07:04,373 --> 01:07:06,887
Oh, you've been thinking. And?

868
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:12,762
I might have to put the wedding
on hold, is all.

869
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:18,329
Look, I know that that could be
tricky for certain people to accept...

870
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:22,452
...at first, all right?
But life is short, Miles.

871
01:07:22,613 --> 01:07:26,447
I have to be sure I'm doing the right
thing before taking such a big step.

872
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:28,569
You know,
that's not just for my sake.

873
01:07:28,733 --> 01:07:31,167
I'm looking out
for Christine's feelings too.

874
01:07:31,933 --> 01:07:35,642
I mean, being with Stephanie has
completely opened my eyes.

875
01:07:35,813 --> 01:07:38,452
She's not uptight or controlling,
she's just cool.

876
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:41,972
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different...

877
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:45,284
...she fucks different.
Fucks like an animal.

878
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,005
I gotta tell you, man...

879
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,847
...I went deep last night.

880
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:54,446
Deep.

881
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:56,885
Deep.

882
01:07:57,453 --> 01:08:00,490
I thought I'd get understanding
from you, but I guess not.

883
01:08:00,653 --> 01:08:03,565
Understanding about what, Jack?

884
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:08,931
I might be in love with another woman.

885
01:08:09,093 --> 01:08:10,492
In love, really?

886
01:08:10,813 --> 01:08:14,488
Twenty-four hours with a wine-pouring
chick, you're fucking in love.

887
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:17,326
Come on. And you're gonna
give up everything.

888
01:08:19,853 --> 01:08:21,366
Here's what I'm thinking.

889
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:24,764
You and me, we move up here,
we buy a vineyard.

890
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:28,403
You design the wine,
I'll handle the business side.

891
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:32,088
You get inspired, maybe you write
another novel, one that can sell.

892
01:08:32,253 --> 01:08:35,609
As for me, if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s there, two hours away.

893
01:08:35,773 --> 01:08:39,402
Jesus Christ, you're crazy.
You've gone crazy.

894
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:46,051
All I know is that I'm an actor.

895
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:48,807
All I have is my instinct.

896
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,883
- You're asking me to go against it.
- Hi, guys.

897
01:08:59,053 --> 01:09:01,886
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

898
01:09:02,053 --> 01:09:04,123
Where?

899
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:12,965
All right, here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice. Nice.

900
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:18,004
Okay, it's the bridge.
Golden Gate Bridge. There you go.

901
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:25,129
I mean, I've gotten over it. Stephanie's
heard this a thousand times...

902
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:29,206
...but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance...

903
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:32,171
...I would've made a fortune
when they put in that...

904
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:35,405
- Home Depot.
- Home Depot, and those stores.

905
01:09:35,573 --> 01:09:37,404
And your father knew about it too.

906
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,645
He's such a fucking chickenshit.
Always was.

907
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:44,692
Just a fucking chickenshit.
Just too scared.

908
01:09:44,853 --> 01:09:47,890
- Is this bothering you?
- No, it's fine.

909
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,962
Hey, man, I'm gonna make sure
Siena and Stephanie get home safe.

910
01:09:54,133 --> 01:09:56,363
- Maybe we'll hook up later.
- Sure, whatever.

911
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:59,001
- I'll catch a movie or something.
- Later, Miles.

912
01:09:59,173 --> 01:10:01,050
Thanks, Stephanie, see you.

913
01:10:01,213 --> 01:10:02,492
- Bye, Siena.
- Bye.

914
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:05,849
- Carol, it was very nice meeting you.
- I loved talking with you.

915
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:09,164
If you go out later,
call me on my cell.

916
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,005
Okay!

917
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,605
- Okay, that's it?
- Yeah.

918
01:10:25,773 --> 01:10:30,483
<i><b>Actually, can I get a Barely Legal,
please? Thank you.</b></i>

919
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:34,129
No, actually, sorry, the new one.
Thank you.

920
01:10:35,613 --> 01:10:37,028
Thanks.

921
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:48,684
Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?

922
01:11:48,853 --> 01:11:52,732
You know me, I love it up here.
How about you?

923
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:57,409
Busy for a Tuesday night. We had a
busload of old folks on a wine tour.

924
01:11:57,573 --> 01:12:00,770
Usually they're not rowdy, but
tonight something was going on.

925
01:12:00,933 --> 01:12:03,208
Full moon or something.
What can I get you?

926
01:12:03,373 --> 01:12:06,012
- Highliner.
- Glass or bottle?

927
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:07,765
Bottle.

928
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:09,207
You got it.

929
01:12:09,373 --> 01:12:11,409
Say, is Maya working?

930
01:12:11,573 --> 01:12:16,647
Maya? No, I haven't seen her.
I think she's off tonight.

931
01:12:28,533 --> 01:12:31,969
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, I'm good.

932
01:13:08,653 --> 01:13:09,927
Crap.

933
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:14,209
- Ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
- Nope.

934
01:13:14,373 --> 01:13:17,649
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie will tell you.

935
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:21,886
Could you just give me a little
room, Jack, please? Thank you.

936
01:13:22,053 --> 01:13:24,567
In life, you gotta strike
while the iron's hot.

937
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,043
- Iron is hot.
- Sage advice, Jack.

938
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:34,243
Now remember, sit back on your heels.
Turn through the abdomen.

939
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:38,042
- Abdomen.
- Oh, fuck.

940
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:39,441
Nice.

941
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:43,124
- What about your agent? Hear anything?
- Nope.

942
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:46,603
- What do you think's going on?
- Could be anything.

943
01:13:46,773 --> 01:13:49,606
- You been checking your messages?
- Obsessively.

944
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:53,450
Guess I'll have to kiss off
another three years of my life.

945
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,765
But you haven't heard anything...

946
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:58,891
...so don't you think
your negativity's premature?

947
01:14:00,493 --> 01:14:02,927
You know, fuck the
New York publishers.

948
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:06,927
Publish it yourself, Miles. I'll chip in.
Just get it out there.

949
01:14:07,093 --> 01:14:12,167
Get it reviewed. Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.

950
01:14:17,093 --> 01:14:19,004
Don't come over the top.

951
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:21,323
- Stay still.
- Shut up.

952
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:25,246
It's all about stillness.

953
01:14:25,413 --> 01:14:28,769
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

954
01:14:28,933 --> 01:14:33,245
Jesus Christ, man. What the hell is
wrong with you?! Please just shut up!

955
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:36,803
- Fuck!
- What's with the hostility, man?

956
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,248
I know you're a little frustrated
with your life right now...

957
01:14:39,413 --> 01:14:42,405
...but you can choose
to be less hostile.

958
01:14:46,973 --> 01:14:49,043
The fucker hit into us.

959
01:14:49,893 --> 01:14:52,009
Hurry it up, will you!

960
01:14:52,373 --> 01:14:58,209
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- Hey, that's not cool, asshole!

961
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:12,772
- Nice shot.
- Jack-offs.

962
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:14,571
What the hell are you doing?

963
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:17,327
Oops! Look out.

964
01:15:23,093 --> 01:15:24,970
Check it out.

965
01:15:25,133 --> 01:15:28,250
This is gonna be fun.
This is gonna be fun.

966
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:40,003
Don't give up on Maya. Cool
chicks like that require persistence.

967
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:42,368
I don't wanna talk about it, please.

968
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:46,526
All I know is that she's beautiful,
lot of soul, she's perfect for you.

969
01:15:46,693 --> 01:15:50,368
I won't feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

970
01:15:50,533 --> 01:15:54,048
Don't you wanna feel that cozy little
box grip down on your johnson?

971
01:15:54,213 --> 01:15:56,966
Hey! Mind keeping it down, buddy?

972
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:00,570
If she finds out how I live,
that I'm not a published author...

973
01:16:00,733 --> 01:16:02,644
...that I'm a liar, essentially...

974
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:06,044
...any interest she has is gonna
evaporate real quick.

975
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:09,762
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not in the game anymore.

976
01:16:09,933 --> 01:16:13,209
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

977
01:16:13,373 --> 01:16:15,728
Abattoir. What is that?

978
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:18,327
- Slaughterhouse.
- Abattoir.

979
01:16:19,773 --> 01:16:21,923
But you are gonna be
a published author...

980
01:16:22,093 --> 01:16:25,449
...because you're gonna get good
news this week about your book.

981
01:16:25,613 --> 01:16:28,810
I know you are. I can feel it.

982
01:16:28,973 --> 01:16:33,763
It's Stephanie. Hey, honey. Yeah.

983
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,005
Yeah!

984
01:16:42,693 --> 01:16:44,172
Nice.

985
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,805
Heard you stopped by
the restaurant to see me last night.

986
01:16:52,973 --> 01:16:57,569
Yeah. No. Yeah, I stopped by
for a drink, I didn't see you.

987
01:16:57,733 --> 01:17:01,965
- I had class.
- Well, nice to see you now.

988
01:17:02,133 --> 01:17:03,885
It's good to see you too.

989
01:17:11,813 --> 01:17:15,328
Syrah. Oldest... Hang on.

990
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:18,843
The oldest syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.

991
01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:20,412
Did you know that?

992
01:17:25,973 --> 01:17:30,763
The Pinot Noir grape has been
cultivated perhaps since antiquity...

993
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:36,610
...in Burgundy, and it is precisely
this ancient and imperative...

994
01:17:36,773 --> 01:17:39,924
...winemaking knowledge,
that has contributed...

995
01:18:41,933 --> 01:18:44,686
I was like, 16, 17, yeah.

996
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,764
- I'm gonna die!
- God.

997
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:49,286
Mom.

998
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:51,603
- Oh, hey.
- Is it too loud?

999
01:18:53,653 --> 01:18:56,929
Sorry. Uncle Jack will put
you back to bed, okay?

1000
01:18:57,093 --> 01:19:01,166
- Come here, little sister.
- We'll be more quiet, okay?

1001
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:03,684
Good night. Sorry.

1002
01:19:03,853 --> 01:19:05,730
I am so sorry.

1003
01:19:06,213 --> 01:19:09,842
My favorite is... Has to be
Chunky Monkey...

1004
01:21:29,853 --> 01:21:32,731
You guys should come by the
restaurant for lunch today.

1005
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,884
What's the latest
we can get there?

1006
01:21:35,093 --> 01:21:36,765
About 2:30.

1007
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:43,690
Did you hear about this Bordeaux-tasting
dinner in Santa Barbara on Saturday?

1008
01:21:43,853 --> 01:21:47,482
It's kind of pricey. But if you
wanted to go, I'd be into it.

1009
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:50,613
Why don't you just stay
for the weekend?

1010
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:53,765
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

1011
01:21:53,933 --> 01:21:55,651
What rehearsal dinner?

1012
01:21:57,053 --> 01:21:58,930
Who's getting married?

1013
01:21:59,613 --> 01:22:01,649
Were you ever gonna say anything?

1014
01:22:01,813 --> 01:22:04,452
Of course. Just now
I could've told you some story...

1015
01:22:04,613 --> 01:22:06,092
...but I told you the truth.

1016
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:08,767
- Maya.
- Don't touch me!

1017
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:11,808
Just take me home.

1018
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:15,283
Do you know
what he's been saying to her?

1019
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:18,650
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

1020
01:22:18,813 --> 01:22:21,566
She's the only woman that's
ever rocked his world.

1021
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:23,325
How he adores Siena.

1022
01:22:23,493 --> 01:22:25,404
How he wants to get
a place with them...

1023
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,165
...and commute when he has to.

1024
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,927
I'm sure he believed every word of it.

1025
01:22:30,093 --> 01:22:31,508
Please believe me.

1026
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:34,772
I was on the verge of telling you
last night, but...

1027
01:22:34,933 --> 01:22:37,163
But you wanted to fuck me first.

1028
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:43,570
- Oh, Maya, no.
- Yeah.

1029
01:22:54,533 --> 01:22:58,128
You know, I've just spent the last
three years of my life...

1030
01:22:58,293 --> 01:23:02,491
...trying to extricate myself from a
relationship that was full of deception.

1031
01:23:02,653 --> 01:23:04,211
And I'm doing just fine.

1032
01:23:05,933 --> 01:23:09,403
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce.

1033
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:13,412
So this has been a big deal
for me, Maya.

1034
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:17,612
Hanging out with you, and last night.

1035
01:23:18,413 --> 01:23:20,881
I really like you, Maya.

1036
01:23:21,253 --> 01:23:25,451
And I am not Jack.
I'm... I'm...

1037
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:31,690
I'm his freshman-year roommate
from San Diego State.

1038
01:23:56,213 --> 01:24:00,001
There's my boy. There he is.

1039
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:03,722
But who's your daddy?
Who is your daddy?

1040
01:24:03,893 --> 01:24:06,566
Oh, let me love you.

1041
01:24:09,173 --> 01:24:11,846
I am so proud of you.

1042
01:24:12,373 --> 01:24:16,002
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. All right. Details. I love details.

1043
01:24:16,253 --> 01:24:18,926
- No.
- What?

1044
01:24:19,093 --> 01:24:21,482
Jesus. It's private.

1045
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:24,451
Tell me what happened
or I'll tie your dick in a knot.

1046
01:24:24,613 --> 01:24:27,685
Let's just leave it, okay?

1047
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,972
You didn't get any, did you?

1048
01:24:32,533 --> 01:24:36,606
- You're a homo.
- Right. Yep, I'm a homo, yeah.

1049
01:24:36,773 --> 01:24:40,448
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened, okay?

1050
01:24:40,613 --> 01:24:44,128
Write out my gay confession,
and I'll sign it, okay?

1051
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:47,126
Just stop pushing me all the time.

1052
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:49,249
You're an infant, Jack.

1053
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:52,964
This is all a big party for you,
but not for me.

1054
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:56,842
Come on. I'm sorry, man.

1055
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:01,288
Did you have trouble performing?

1056
01:25:02,653 --> 01:25:04,564
Yeah, that's a shame.

1057
01:25:06,093 --> 01:25:07,587
Don't answer it.

1058
01:25:09,773 --> 01:25:11,142
Don't answer it.

1059
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:14,205
- Jack.
- Hello.

1060
01:25:15,253 --> 01:25:16,766
Yeah.

1061
01:25:17,733 --> 01:25:19,246
It's Christine.

1062
01:25:19,893 --> 01:25:21,929
Yeah. Yeah.

1063
01:25:23,653 --> 01:25:25,166
Let me call you right back.

1064
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:28,052
Miles and I are kind of
in the middle of something.

1065
01:25:28,213 --> 01:25:32,570
No, it's nothing serious.
He's having one of his freak-outs.

1066
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,562
I love you too.
I'll call you back.

1067
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:40,451
This whole week has gone sour. It hasn't
gone the way it was supposed to.

1068
01:25:41,253 --> 01:25:43,642
I just wanna go home.

1069
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:46,532
I know what you need.

1070
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,645
How about this one?
We didn't hit it.

1071
01:25:49,813 --> 01:25:52,373
- Frass Canyon, that's a joke.
- Ever been in there?

1072
01:25:52,533 --> 01:25:55,570
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

1073
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,893
Tastes like the back of a fucking
L.A. School bus.

1074
01:26:33,413 --> 01:26:37,531
They probably didn't de-stem, hoping
for some semblance of concentration.

1075
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,251
Crushed-up leaves and mice...

1076
01:26:39,413 --> 01:26:43,804
...and then would up with this rancid
tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

1077
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:45,964
Fucking Raid.

1078
01:26:47,253 --> 01:26:49,813
Tastes pretty good to me.

1079
01:26:49,973 --> 01:26:52,248
Look. They have a reserve Pinot.

1080
01:26:52,413 --> 01:26:54,927
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

1081
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:57,607
I can't take it anymore,
I gotta call Evelyn.

wines, kicking back. It's very nice.

1090
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,762

Still no word, huh?

01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:28,692
Sure.

1109
01:28:28,693 --> 01:28:32,606
There's a special on the syrah.
By the case.

1110
01:28:33,533 --> 01:28:35,012
Hit me again.

1111

a full glass? I'll pay for it, okay?

1112
01:28:48,733 --> 01:28:52,123
Sir, this is a winery. Not a bar.

1113
01:28:54,213 --> 01:28:56,807
Just give me a full goddamn pour.

1114
01:28:58,453 --> 01:29:03,163
Excuse me. Why don't you
buy a bottle and go outside.

1115
01:29:07,053 --> 01:29:08,292
What are you doing?

1116
01:29:08,293 --> 01:29:11,171
I need a drink
so I'm gonna help myself, okay, pal?

1117
01:29:11,493 --> 01:29:14,929
- Put the glass down.
- Let go of the fucking glass, fucker.

1118
01:29:23,053 --> 01:29:24,486
How's that?

1119
01:29:26,013 --> 01:29:28,243
Whoa, buddy. It's okay.

1120
01:29:28,413 --> 01:29:30,927
- Get him out of here.
- Thanks a lot.

1121
01:29:31,093 --> 01:29:32,890
His mother just died.

1122
01:29:36,933 --> 01:29:39,652
So you write another one.
You've got lots of ideas.

1123
01:29:39,853 --> 01:29:41,650
No, I'm finished.

1124
01:29:41,813 --> 01:29:44,930
I'm not a writer,
I'm a middle school English teacher.

1125
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:50,564
The world doesn't give a shit what
I have to say. I'm unnecessary.

1126
01:29:51,613 --> 01:29:54,969
I'm so insignificant
I can't even kill myself.

1127
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:57,767
Miles, what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

1128
01:29:57,933 --> 01:30:02,768
Come on, man, you know.
Hemingway, Sexton, Plath, Woolf.

1129
01:30:02,933 --> 01:30:06,289
You can't kill yourself before
you've even been published.

1130

<i><b>What about the guy that wrote
Confederacy of Dunces?</b></i>

1131

before he was published.

1132
01:30:14,613 --> 01:30:16,410
Look how famous he is.

1133
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:20,046
Thanks.

1134
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:25,643
Just don't give up. All right?

1135
01:30:25,813 --> 01:30:27,087
You're gonna make it.

1136
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:33,408
Half my life is over and I have nothing
to show for it. Nothing.

1137
01:30:33,573 --> 01:30:36,724
I'm a thumbprint on the window
of a skyscraper.

1138
01:30:36,893 --> 01:30:40,886
I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue...

1139
01:30:41,053 --> 01:30:44,807
...surging out to sea with a million tons
of raw sewage.

1140
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:49,842
See? Right there. Just what
you just said, that is beautiful.

1141
01:30:50,013 --> 01:30:52,208
"A smudge of excrement...

1143
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:56,608
I could never write that.

1144
01:30:56,773 --> 01:30:59,890
Neither could I actually,
I think it's Bukowski.

1145
01:31:22,933 --> 01:31:24,427
Hey, baby.

1146
01:31:28,293 --> 01:31:30,204
Look what I got
for our favorite girl.

1147
01:31:30,373 --> 01:31:32,204
- You motherfucker!
- Jesus Christ.

1148
01:31:32,373 --> 01:31:37,493
Fucking bastard, lying piece of shit!
You're getting married on Saturday?

1149
01:31:37,653 --> 01:31:39,564
What was all that shit
you said to me?

1150
01:31:39,733 --> 01:31:41,610
- Stephanie, stop!
- I can explain!

1151
01:31:41,773 --> 01:31:44,207
- You said you loved me!
- I do!

1152
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:45,806
I hope you die!

1153
01:31:45,973 --> 01:31:47,452
Stop it, Stephanie!

1154
01:31:56,373 --> 01:32:00,412
- Fuckface! You too!
- Me?

1155
01:32:02,613 --> 01:32:04,046
You fucking told Maya!

1156
01:32:04,213 --> 01:32:07,091
No, I did not. No, I did not.

1157
01:32:07,253 --> 01:32:09,562
It must have been Gary
at the Hitching Post.

1158
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,167
I think we mentioned it to him
the first night.

1159
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:13,686
Did "we" mention it?

1160
01:32:13,853 --> 01:32:18,210
You mentioned it, asshole!
I'm fucking hurting over here!

1161
01:32:18,373 --> 01:32:20,250
Keep it elevated.

1162
01:32:34,053 --> 01:32:35,327
<i><b>It's Miles.</b></i>

1163
01:32:36,293 --> 01:32:40,081
I had to call and tell you again...

1164
01:32:40,253 --> 01:32:43,609
...how much I enjoyed
our time together...

1165
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:48,646
...and how sorry I am that things
turned out the way they did.

1166
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:52,731
I think you're great, Maya.

1167
01:32:53,653 --> 01:32:57,407
Always have. From the first time
that you waited on me.

1168
01:33:00,733 --> 01:33:03,008
And while I'm at it...

1169
01:33:03,173 --> 01:33:05,846
...I guess maybe
you should know that...

1170
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:09,801
...my book is not getting published.

1171
01:33:09,973 --> 01:33:14,171
I thought this one had a chance,
but I was wrong, again.

1172
01:33:14,693 --> 01:33:16,365
Once again.

1173
01:33:17,533 --> 01:33:22,209
So you see, I'm not really much
of a writer.

1174
01:33:23,213 --> 01:33:26,250
I am not much of anything, really.

1175
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:39,325
I have to have an operation.

1176
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:43,652
Maybe even a couple of them.
They'll wait for my nose to heal first.

1177
01:33:43,813 --> 01:33:46,043
- And then they break it again.
- Oh, Christ.

1178
01:33:46,213 --> 01:33:49,888
- Good thing you have a voiceover career.
- It's gonna fuck that up too.

1179
01:33:50,053 --> 01:33:51,452
I ought to sue her ass.

1180
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:54,081
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.

1181
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:55,766
That's thoughtful.

1182
01:34:00,573 --> 01:34:02,768
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?

1183
01:34:02,933 --> 01:34:05,083
We didn't get into that with Gary.

1184
01:34:08,453 --> 01:34:09,886
Yeah, let me think.

1185
01:34:10,053 --> 01:34:12,123
You sure you didn't say anything
to Maya?

1186
01:34:12,293 --> 01:34:14,568
Yes, I'm sure, I'm sure.

1187
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:17,372
And just what are you implying, Jack?

1188
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:21,162
I'm pissed off at you about all this,
if you wanna know the truth.

1189
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:25,167
What is Maya gonna think of me now
just for associating with you?

1190
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:32,770
- I don't know. Sure seems fishy.

you're sitting at my table.

1222
01:37:06,893 --> 01:37:09,248
Listen, man. Cammi gets off in an hour.

1223
01:37:09,413 --> 01:37:12,644
So I was thinking I'd just hang
around, have a drink.

1224
01:37:12,933 --> 01:37:15,845
You know, make sure
she gets home safe.

1225
01:37:16,573 --> 01:37:18,768
You're joking, right?

1226
01:37:19,493 --> 01:37:21,245
No.

1227
01:37:22,173 --> 01:37:23,731
Un-fucking-believable.

1228
01:37:23,893 --> 01:37:28,967
Can't we just go back to the motel
and hang out?

1229
01:37:29,253 --> 01:37:34,327
Get up early, play nine holes
of golf before we head home?

1230
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:39,286
Listen, man.

1231
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:43,002
You're my friend. And I know you
care about me.

1232
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:46,526
And I know you disapprove,
and I respect that.

1233
01:37:46,733 --> 01:37:51,090
But there are some things that I
have to do that you don't understand.

1234
01:37:51,293 --> 01:37:55,571
You understand literature,
movies, wine.

1235
01:37:55,853 --> 01:37:59,004
But you don't understand my plight.

1236
01:38:16,853 --> 01:38:18,081
Yeah.

1237
01:38:19,413 --> 01:38:21,802
- Holy shit!
- Fuck! Fuck!

1238
01:38:22,013 --> 01:38:25,847
- Jesus Christ!
- God! It's fucking freezing out there!

1239
01:38:26,013 --> 01:38:27,287
God. Yeah!

1240
01:38:27,453 --> 01:38:29,967
Vicodin, where's the Vicodin?

1241
01:38:36,133 --> 01:38:37,885
Here.

1242
01:38:44,013 --> 01:38:47,050
- Fucking chick's married, man.
- What?

1243
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:49,966
Her husband works a night shift,
and comes home...

1244
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:52,852
...and catches me with
my cock in his wife's ass.

1245
01:38:53,013 --> 01:38:56,403
Jesus Christ. Jesus, Jack.

1246
01:38:56,573 --> 01:38:58,564
You walked all the
way from Solvang?

1247
01:38:58,733 --> 01:39:01,611
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

1248
01:39:01,773 --> 01:39:03,365
That's five klicks, Jackson.

1249
01:39:03,533 --> 01:39:07,845
Fucking-A right it's five klicks. At one
point I cut through an ostrich farm.

1250
01:39:08,013 --> 01:39:10,163
Those fuckers are mean.

1251
01:39:23,493 --> 01:39:25,051
We gotta go back.

1252
01:39:26,733 --> 01:39:31,011
- What?
- We gotta go back. I left my wallet.

1253
01:39:31,173 --> 01:39:34,290
Credit cards, cash, my fucking ID.
We gotta go back.

1254
01:39:34,453 --> 01:39:38,412
Big deal. Don't worry about it.
We'll call now and cancel your cards.

1255
01:39:38,573 --> 01:39:40,052
No, you don't understand.

1256
01:39:40,253 --> 01:39:43,404
The wedding rings. The wedding rings
are in my wallet.

1257
01:39:43,933 --> 01:39:45,525
Fine. They're in your wallet.

1258
01:39:45,693 --> 01:39:48,969
And you left it in some bar.
Christine will understand.

1259
01:39:49,133 --> 01:39:51,442
No, she had to order them special.
It took forever.

1260
01:39:51,613 --> 01:39:56,846
They've got this design of dolphins
and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

1261
01:39:57,053 --> 01:40:00,250
We gotta go back, man.
Christine will fucking crucify me.

1262
01:40:00,413 --> 01:40:02,244
No way, no way.

1263
01:40:02,453 --> 01:40:05,525
- Please. Please!
- Forget it.

1264
01:40:05,693 --> 01:40:08,207
Your wallet was stolen in a bar.
It happens...

1265
01:40:08,373 --> 01:40:10,603
We gotta go and get my
wallet, Miles.

1266
01:40:10,813 --> 01:40:13,088
Those rings are irreplaceable.

1267
01:40:13,253 --> 01:40:17,326
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.

1268
01:40:17,533 --> 01:40:20,172
But you've gotta help me.
You've gotta help me.

1269
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:24,804
Please! I can't lose Christine, Miles.

1270
01:40:24,973 --> 01:40:27,851
I just can't. I can't lose Christine.

1271
01:40:28,373 --> 01:40:32,048
I know I fucked up. I know I did
a bad thing, all right?

1272
01:40:32,213 --> 01:40:35,250
And I know I'm a bad person.
I know I am.

1273
01:40:35,453 --> 01:40:38,251
But you gotta help me.
You have to help me, Miles.

1274
01:40:38,693 --> 01:40:43,369
Okay? Tell me you'll help me.
If I lose Christine...

1275
01:40:44,293 --> 01:40:46,284
...I'm nothing.

1276
01:40:46,493 --> 01:40:47,892
I just am...

1277
01:40:48,053 --> 01:40:50,613
I'm nothing.

1278
01:40:51,893 --> 01:40:53,724
Did she tell you she was married?

1279
01:40:53,893 --> 01:40:55,645
- Yeah.
- What were you thinking?

1280
01:40:55,813 --> 01:40:58,850
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6.
Fucker rolls in at 5.

1281
01:40:59,013 --> 01:41:01,891
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

1282
01:41:02,773 --> 01:41:04,001
This is the block.

1283
01:41:04,173 --> 01:41:06,164
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1284
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:13,731
That's it. That's it.
That's the one right there.

1285
01:41:14,133 --> 01:41:16,283
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1286
01:41:16,453 --> 01:41:17,822
Okay.

1287
01:41:20,453 --> 01:41:21,932
All right.

1288
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:25,609
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1289
01:41:26,133 --> 01:41:30,968
- The plan is you go.
- Me?!

1290
01:41:31,173 --> 01:41:34,006
Because of my ankle. Still hurts.

1291
01:41:34,173 --> 01:41:36,641
Just go explain the situation, Miles.

1292
01:41:36,813 --> 01:41:39,407
Explain the situation?
"Yes, excuse me, sir...

1293
01:41:39,573 --> 01:41:42,690
...my friend was balling your
wife a couple hours ago.

1294
01:41:42,853 --> 01:41:45,845
Really sorry. He seems to have left
his wallet behind.

1295
01:41:46,013 --> 01:41:48,652
I was wondering if I could
come in, poke around."

1296
01:41:48,813 --> 01:41:51,930
- Yeah, just like that. That's good.
- For chrissake.

1297
01:41:54,573 --> 01:41:58,361
Oh, fuck it. I'll go!
I guess I have to do everything.

1298
01:41:58,573 --> 01:42:01,804
No. Hold on.

1299
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:46,364
You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now!

1300
01:43:46,533 --> 01:43:49,809
I'm a bad girl! I'm a bad girl!

1301
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:52,806
You picked him up and
fucked him, didn't you, bitch?

1302
01:43:52,973 --> 01:43:55,646
I picked him up and fucked
him. I'm a bad girl.

1303
01:43:55,853 --> 01:43:58,686
You liked fucking him, didn't you,
you little whore?

1304
01:43:58,853 --> 01:44:02,084
You caught me fucking him!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1305
01:44:02,253 --> 01:44:05,529
- You are a bad bitch.
- Yeah, you caught me!

1306
01:44:05,693 --> 01:44:10,847
Such a whore. Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

1307
01:44:15,133 --> 01:44:17,931
- You're so bad!
- I am!

1308
01:44:22,293 --> 01:44:24,602
You are such a whore!

1309
01:44:24,813 --> 01:44:26,565
What the fuck!

1310
01:44:26,733 --> 01:44:29,042
The wallet! He's got Derrick's wallet!

1311
01:44:41,013 --> 01:44:43,322
- Motherfucker!
- Here's your wallet! Shit!

1312
01:44:43,533 --> 01:44:45,649
Open this door!
Open the goddamn door!

1313
01:44:45,813 --> 01:44:48,486
- I'm gonna kill your ass!
- You got my wallet!

1314
01:44:48,653 --> 01:44:52,407
I'll find you! I will find you!
I'll find your ass!

1315
01:44:52,573 --> 01:44:55,041
You're mine, man! You're mine!

1316
01:45:28,013 --> 01:45:31,642
- You wanna let me drive?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

1317
01:45:32,373 --> 01:45:36,286
You know, you ought to invite
Maya to the wedding.

1318
01:45:37,413 --> 01:45:40,371
Somehow, I think inviting
Maya to the wedding...

1319
01:45:40,533 --> 01:45:43,286
...is not the right move at this juncture.

1320
01:45:43,613 --> 01:45:47,128
I don't know. In fact, after all
of your shenanigans...

1321
01:45:47,293 --> 01:45:50,490
...it'll be hard for me to go
to the Hitching Post again.

1322
01:45:50,653 --> 01:45:53,406
You know, there was a nice way
to respond to that.

1323
01:45:53,933 --> 01:45:56,766
- Come on, let me drive.
- I got it. You should rest.

1324
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,889
You know what? I feel like driving.

1325
01:45:59,533 --> 01:46:01,603
Okay.

1326
01:46:03,093 --> 01:46:04,731
Put on your seat belt, okay?

1327
01:46:04,893 --> 01:46:08,966
- I was about to. What's the problem?
- Just wanna remind you to be safe.

1328
01:46:09,173 --> 01:46:11,289
- Jack, we missed the entrance.
- Yeah.

1329
01:46:11,453 --> 01:46:14,604
What are you doing, Jack?
Hey, hey, whoa!

1330
01:46:14,813 --> 01:46:17,691
- Hang on.
- What the hell are you doing? Jack!

1331
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:20,771
What the fuck!

1332
01:46:20,973 --> 01:46:23,885
- You said it looked like an accident.
- What the fuck!

1333
01:46:24,053 --> 01:46:25,486
- I'll pay for it!
- Jesus.

1334
01:46:26,533 --> 01:46:28,649
Christ, Jack! Oh, for...!

1335
01:46:28,813 --> 01:46:30,485
Look at this!

1336
01:46:33,693 --> 01:46:38,562
I don't know. Doesn't look like
anyone was injured in this one.

1337
01:46:39,293 --> 01:46:41,284
No, no.

1338
01:46:41,973 --> 01:46:43,372
Watch your head.

1339
01:46:43,893 --> 01:46:46,805
Boy. You broke a couple
of them, you know.

1340
01:46:46,973 --> 01:46:49,806
- Whatever. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not whatever.

1341
01:46:49,973 --> 01:46:52,089
You fucking derelict.

1342
01:46:53,453 --> 01:46:56,445
- You ready?
- Just get it over with.

1343
01:47:37,053 --> 01:47:40,807
Okey-doke. All right.

1344
01:47:41,653 --> 01:47:45,123
- Well, I guess that's about it.
- You wanna come inside?

1345
01:47:45,293 --> 01:47:48,683
No. No, you're on your own.

1346
01:47:49,293 --> 01:47:50,572
All right.

1347
01:47:50,573 --> 01:47:53,326
- I guess I'll see you at the rehearsal.
- Yep.

1348
01:47:55,853 --> 01:47:59,368
- Come here. I love you, man.
- Yeah, back at you.

1349
01:47:59,693 --> 01:48:02,127
Miles, don't drive away
until they see the car.

1350
01:48:02,293 --> 01:48:06,969
I know, I know, I know. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?

1351
01:48:07,733 --> 01:48:10,406
Because you were wearing
your seat belt.

1352
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:14,689
Nicely done.

1353
01:50:45,853 --> 01:50:48,048
Hey, Miles.

1354
01:50:48,653 --> 01:50:50,052
Hi, Vicky.

1355
01:50:51,373 --> 01:50:53,091
Wow, you look beautiful.

1356
01:50:53,253 --> 01:50:54,702
Thanks.

1357
01:50:54,973 --> 01:50:57,089
This is Ken Cortland, my husband.

1358
01:50:57,253 --> 01:50:59,289
- How are you?
- How are you?

1359
01:50:59,533 --> 01:51:02,730
- Good, thanks.
- Nice to meet you. You're a lucky guy.

1360
01:51:03,293 --> 01:51:09,209
Yes, I am. Thank you.
Well, I'll just wait for you at the car.

1361
01:51:09,373 --> 01:51:12,445
- It was great meeting you, Miles.
- Ken.

1362
01:51:16,413 --> 01:51:20,042
- Well, that was big of him.
- Yeah, he's good that way.

1363
01:51:20,693 --> 01:51:23,446
- He's very considerate.
- That's great.

1364
01:51:23,933 --> 01:51:25,651
So how you doing?

1365
01:51:26,213 --> 01:51:28,773
Since the last time we spoke?
I don't know.

1366
01:51:28,933 --> 01:51:31,766
Could be better, could be worse.

1367
01:51:32,333 --> 01:51:34,528
So, what's happening with your book?

1368
01:51:34,693 --> 01:51:38,368
Universally rejected. Strike three.

1369
01:51:38,773 --> 01:51:43,130
Miles, that's awful.
What are you gonna do?

1370
01:51:43,373 --> 01:51:48,811
Back to the drawing board, I guess.
Or not. I don't know.

1371
01:51:49,333 --> 01:51:52,052
So anyway, you're married.

1372
01:51:52,293 --> 01:51:55,171
Congratulations. You look happy.

1373
01:51:55,413 --> 01:51:57,608
- I am.
- Good.

1374
01:51:57,773 --> 01:52:00,241
Seems like everybody
is getting married.

1375
01:52:00,453 --> 01:52:04,332
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.

1376
01:52:04,493 --> 01:52:05,721
Cyclical, I guess.

1377
01:52:06,413 --> 01:52:08,369
I guess.

1378
01:52:12,493 --> 01:52:15,644
Well, what do you say we
hit the reception?

1379
01:52:16,053 --> 01:52:18,283
Have some champagne,
toast the newlyweds.

1380
01:52:18,453 --> 01:52:20,569
Not me. I'm not drinking.

1381
01:52:21,493 --> 01:52:24,087
You quit drinking? Really?

1382
01:52:24,693 --> 01:52:26,604
I'm pregnant.

1383
01:52:28,173 --> 01:52:29,652
I see.

1384
01:52:31,653 --> 01:52:34,121
Yes, I see. Great.

1385
01:52:35,933 --> 01:52:41,371
Well, congratulations again, Vicky.
Boy, that's wonderful news.

1386
01:52:43,093 --> 01:52:45,653
- See you over there, Miles?
- Yeah.

1387
01:54:52,133 --> 01:54:55,284
"'The marrow of his bone,'
I repeated aimlessly.

1388
01:54:55,453 --> 01:54:57,762
This at last penetrated my mind.

1389
01:54:57,933 --> 01:55:01,130
Phineas had died from
the marrow of his bone...

1390
01:55:01,293 --> 01:55:04,205
...flowing down his bloodstream
to his heart.

1391
01:55:04,373 --> 01:55:07,490
I did not cry then
or ever about Finny.

1392
01:55:07,653 --> 01:55:12,249
I did not cry. Even when I stood
watching him being lowered...

1393
01:55:12,413 --> 01:55:16,326
...into his family's strait-laced
burial ground outside of Boston.

1394
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:19,883
I could not escape the feeling that
this was my own funeral.

1395
01:55:20,053 --> 01:55:22,851
And you do not cry in that case."

1396
01:55:23,493 --> 01:55:26,485
Should I keep reading the next
chapter, Mr. Raymond?

1397
01:55:26,653 --> 01:55:30,248
No, we'll pick up there Monday.

1398
01:56:14,733 --> 01:56:16,849
<i><b>One new message.</b></i>

1399
01:56:18,373 --> 01:56:19,965
<i><b>Hello, Miles.</b></i>

1400
01:56:20,133 --> 01:56:21,566
<i><b>It's Maya.</b></i>

1401
01:56:22,413 --> 01:56:24,483
<i><b>Thanks for your letter.</b></i>

1402
01:56:24,893 --> 01:56:27,726
<i><b>I would have called sooner,
but I needed some time...</b></i>

1403
01:56:27,893 --> 01:56:32,489
<i><b>... to think about everything that
happened and what you wrote to me.</b></i>

1404
01:56:33,253 --> 01:56:35,847
<i><b>Another reason
I didn 't call you sooner is...</b></i>

1405
01:56:36,013 --> 01:56:38,925
<i><b>... I wanted to finish your book.
I did last night.</b></i>

1406
01:56:39,093 --> 01:56:42,051
<i><b>And I think it's really lovely, Miles.</b></i>

1407
01:56:42,493 --> 01:56:44,848
<i><b>You're so good with words.</b></i>

1408
01:56:45,013 --> 01:56:49,529
<i><b>Who cares if it's not getting published.
There are so many beautiful...</b></i>

1409
01:56:49,693 --> 01:56:52,127
<i><b>... and painful things about it.</b></i>

1410
01:56:52,533 --> 01:56:57,323
<i><b>Did you really go through all that?
It must have been awful.</b></i>

1411
01:56:57,853 --> 01:57:02,290
<i><b>And the sister character.
Jeez! What a wreck.</b></i>

1412
01:57:02,973 --> 01:57:07,091
<i><b>But I have to say that... Well, I was
really confused by the ending.</b></i>

1413
01:57:07,293 --> 01:57:12,572
<i><b>I mean, did the father finally commit
suicide or what? It's driving me crazy.</b></i>

1414
01:57:14,933 --> 01:57:20,371
<i><b>Anyway, it's turned cold
and rainy here lately.</b></i>

1415
01:57:20,733 --> 01:57:22,769
<i><b>But I like winter.</b></i>

1416
01:57:23,493 --> 01:57:26,849
<i><b>So listen, if you ever do decide
to come up here again...</b></i>

1417
01:57:27,013 --> 01:57:30,210
<i><b>... let me know. I would say stop
by the restaurant, but...</b></i>

1418
01:57:30,373 --> 01:57:35,208
<i><b>... I'm not sure how much longer I'll be
there. Because I'm gonna graduate soon.</b></i>

1419
01:57:35,413 --> 01:57:39,611
<i><b>So I'll probably wanna relocate.
We'll see.</b></i>

1420
01:57:41,253 --> 01:57:44,848
<i><b>Anyway, like I said,
I really loved your novel.</b></i>

1421
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:48,882
<i><b>Don 't give up, Miles. Keep writing.</b></i>

1422
01:57:50,093 --> 01:57:51,970
<i><b>I hope you're well.</b></i>

1423
01:57:53,133 --> 01:57:54,612
<i><b>Bye.</b></i>
