Just tell us what's going on?

help you, so I'm going to help you,

fruit plants that were brought

893
00:58:35,874 --> 00:58:42,779
in as a test subject had a spider's nest
hidden inside. The arachnid biology...

894
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,083
...was immediately responsive
to our growth hormone.
