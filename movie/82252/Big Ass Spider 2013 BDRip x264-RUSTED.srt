00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,446
Oh, thank goodness.
Stay, Mrs. Butterworth.

3
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,442
Stay, damn you! Stay!
Stay! Stay!

4
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:37,743
Good morning, Mrs. Jefferson.

5
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:43,050
How are you? Oh. Oh! How are you?
Oh, you're shaking.

6
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,552
Thank you for coming.

7
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:46,353
Okay.

8
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:47,421
Thank you for coming.

9
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:49,056
Oh, that's all right.

10
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:50,657
On your day off especially.

11
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:53,360
Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?
Where is it, out back?

12
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,095
It's in the trap.

13
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,096
In the where?

14
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,598
In the trap.

15
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,601
Okay. All right, it's okay.

16
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,103
Thank you for coming
on your day off.

17
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,105
I got our little friend.

18
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,774
Is it ugly?

19
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:13,380
Is it ugly? They're
all beautiful to me.

20
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:17,584
Kept us up all night long with its ruckus.
Didn't it, Mrs. Butterworth?

21
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:20,387
Butterworthless when it
comes to catching critters.

22
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:24,909
At 5:06 A.M. I heard that trap
shut, and I called you ASAP.

23
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:26,793
You're on my speed dial.

24
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:28,061
I know, Ann.

25
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,896
I hope you rot in hell,
you filthy vermin!

26
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,499
Okay, I'm going to set it
loose in the park, okay?

27
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,101
Yeah, set it loose in the park.

28
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:37,204
Break his neck first.

29
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:41,675
Alex? Alex- Yeah.

30
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:44,711
I am... I'm just...
I'm so embarrassed.

31
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:47,915
The darned government
was late with my Social

32
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,118
Security check again,
so I brought you this.

33
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,819
Oh.

34
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,954
A little sugar.

35
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:56,123
That is so sweet of you.
Thank you.

36
00:04:56,124 --> 00:05:00,060
It's full of maraschino cherries,
and I left off the stems this time.

37
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,030
Wow. Well, you can never count
on the government for anything,

38
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,966
but you can always count on me.
My favorite client.

39
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,201
You are such a nice guy.

40
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:11,938
Ah, well... How come...

41
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,008
...a nice guy like
you is still single?

42
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,061
I ask myself that same
question every day. I

43
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:21,114
guess I just haven't met
the right girl yet.

44
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:22,416
When you do...

45
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:25,419
...she's going to be exhausted.

46
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,122
That was awkward. Okay, bye, Mrs. J.
I'll see-

47
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:30,424
Alex, Alex.

48
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:31,558
Yeah.

49
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,427
You have a spider on your arm.

50
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,028
What? Oh, that's a tattoo.

51
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,997
A spider. No, no, no, no.
A spider is on your arm.

52
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:39,766
Oh, look at that. Look at that.
Oh, that's a brown recluse.

53
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,302
This is highly poisonous.
As long as you don't

54
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:44,838
provoke it, so we just
have to stay calm. Okay?

55
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,106
Let me help you.

56
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:47,140
Remain calm, okay?

57
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:48,709
Let me help you. I can-

58
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,277
No, no, stay calm means
I don't need your help.

59
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:51,878
Okay, let me help you.

60
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,147
No, don't help me. You just stay calm.
No, Mrs. J. No-

61
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:04,090
Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender.

62
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,629
Was that a dead body?

63
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,598
Let's not focus on
that, Mister...

64
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,402
Mathis. Was that one of
your patients, Nurse...

65
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:17,362
Lisa? I mean, I-I don't care.

66
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:20,874
I'm not saying that you
were responsible for that,

67
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:25,879
but being your next patient I
was just a little concerned.

68
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,850
You know, I would imagine, if I
looked up the word "nurse" in,

69
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,986
let's say, <i>Nurse Journal</i> or <i>Nurse
Illustrated</i> or whatever it is,

70
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:35,055
that I would probably
see a picture of you.

71
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:38,125
I mean, you are, like,
the perfect nurse.

72
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:39,426
Are you done?

73
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:41,428
Okay.

74
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:44,731
Okay, so it says here you have a small
puncture wound on your upper arm.

75
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:45,866
Correct.

76
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,267
Can you remove your
shirt, please?

77
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:48,735
Sure.

78
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,704
It might be a bullet
wound, though, actually,

79
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:53,573
because I'm dodging bullets
all day long in what I do.

80
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:55,575
And what is it that you do?

81
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:57,711
Um, well, I actually-

82
00:06:57,712 --> 00:07:03,312
Ow, ow. I, uh... Actually,
I shouldn't tell you.

83
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:05,737
It's top secret.
Ow.

84
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,792
I'd say you're a comedian, but the shirt
gives you away. So do your work books.

85
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:14,628
Well, Mr. Mathis, it looks
like one of your bugs bit you.

86
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,464
From the swelling,
I'd say a spider.

87
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:20,267
You know what? You'd be right.
It was a brown recluse.

88
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:24,271
All right, let's just do 1/10 cc
of Dexamethasone or cortisone,

89
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:27,274
whatever you want. It's
not my first barbecue.

90
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:31,445
Okay, let me check that with the doctor.
I'll be giving you these shots myself.

91
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,947
Then you'll be out fighting
bugs again in no time.

92
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:40,987
Uh, nurse... Lisa... let's say for
a second that this is lethal,

93
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:44,991
and, you know, I've
only got one meal left.

94
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:48,228
What do you say, you,
me, breakfast? Huh?

95
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,528
No.

96
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:53,833
No.

97
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:10,115
It's too early for this crap and
need some help from the captain.

98
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,193
Jeez.

99
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:45,845
$200 for gauze? Seriously, I
hope they accept fruitcake as

100
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,448
payment because I don't
know what I'm going to do.

101
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:56,356
Okay, everybody calm down.
It's just a fire alarm.

102
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:00,293
Walk out, please. Slowly. Let's go, sir.
Don't worry. Don't be scared.

103
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:03,997
It's okay, don't run.
Slowly, slowly.

104
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:05,999
Okay, it's fine, folks.

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,301
It's fine. Everything's fine.

106
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:11,605
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please.

107
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:14,140
Uh, this is a false alarm.
It is a false one, folks.

108
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:16,042
There's no fire
in the building,

109
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,745
so if we could all just remain
calm, that would be great.

110
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,414
Jose, I need you to turn
the damn thing off.

111
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:22,382
Okay, you got it, boss.

112
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,249
Thank you.

113
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,418
Are you okay?

114
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,070
You know what? I can help
them out if you want.

115
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:28,722
You want me to help them out?

116
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:30,423
No, we're okay. We're fine.

117
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,125
You sure?

118
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,426
Yeah, we got it.

119
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:34,394
Excuse me, Director?

120
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:35,895
Yes.

121
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,664
Carl has something
very crazy to say.

122
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:39,699
There's something in the morgue.

123
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,369
It climbed right out of a body bag,
and it bit me. I swear to Christ.

124
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,404
Like the... Like the
living dead, Carl?

125
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:45,505
Jose, please.

126
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,641
Sorry, I like those movies.

127
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:50,210
Carl, what the hell are you talking about?
Did you pull the fire alarm again?

128
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,329
Hell, yes. Didn't you
hear what I said?

129
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,447
There's some sort of
animal that's down here.

130
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:57,684
Okay, but, Carl, you work at a hospital.
If something bites you,

131
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,786
there's doctors and
nurses everywhere.

132
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:03,590
There's no reason for you to pull a fire
alarm and alert the entire building.

133
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,125
But it bit me, boss. It bit me.

134
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:07,494
Maybe somebody brought in a dog.

135
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:09,963
It's not a dog. Listen, I know how this
sounds, but you should have seen it.

136
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:12,065
It's got these long black
legs, like a spider,

137
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,167
but it's much too
big to be a spider.

138
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:16,102
We've got to call somebody.

139
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:18,505
Look, if it was bigger than a
spider, it wasn't a spider.

140
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,540
I'm sure- A black
cat, maybe, Carl.

141
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,876
It's too big to be
a- Call somebody.

142
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:23,877
Was it a monkey?

143
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:25,478
Why would it be a monkey?

144
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,814
Could've been a spider. Carl, right?
Okay. Listen,

145
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,916
it may in fact have
been a giant tarantula.

146
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:32,318
I've seen tarantulas as
big as a foot across.

147
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,853
Who's this guy?

148
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:35,855
He happens to be
an exterminator.

149
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,791
Spiders happen to
be my specialty.

150
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:41,261
I know what spiders are thinking.
I get into a spider's head.

151
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:44,197
I think like a spider. I move
like a spider, all eight legs.

152
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:48,501
I become a spider
to catch a spider.

153
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,459
Okay, all right. Do you
want to go down with

154
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,712
Carl and maybe take
care of this thing?

155
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:02,415
I'd really appreciate it. As you can
see, I've got my hands full here.

156
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,416
Right now? Yeah.

157
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:05,685
I'd really appreciate it.

158
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,287
I would love to do that for you.
Carl, we could do that.

159
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,888
Sure. I love to work pro Bono.

160
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,724
Okay, that's great.
I appreciate that.

161
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,492
No problem at all.

162
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:14,661
No problem. I just have a quick
thing to discuss. See this?

163
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,530
This is my bill for the hospital.
I haven't settled this yet,

164
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:20,900
so I'll take care of this for you
if you take care of this for me.

165
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,470
Sort of quid pro quo pro Bono.

166
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:24,971
Sounds fair to me, boss.

167
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,740
Thank you, Jose.

168
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:29,442
Yes, fine. That's great. Consider
your visit on the house.

169
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:31,778
Thank you.

170
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,830
Great. Okay, Carl, will
you take this gentleman

171
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:35,882
downstairs, and let's get
rid of this bug, okay?

172
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:37,650
Okay, boss, but I
don't feel so good.

173
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:39,886
Let me see the bite.

174
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:43,856
Okay, I'm going to
get you to the E.R.

175
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:49,162
It's going to be an
intern's nightmare.

176
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:50,163
Woof.

177
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:51,464
Jose.

178
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,233
Yeah.

179
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,602
Will you please take our bug-
killing friend to the morgue?

180
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,070
Oh, sure.

181
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,272
Anything he needs, just
take care of it, okay?

182
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,006
You got it, boss.

183
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:02,008
<i>Gracias</i>.

184
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,811
I'm going to have to grab a couple
things from my... from my truck.

185
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,246
That's okay.

186
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,748
You're not a real police
officer, are you?

187
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,550
Security guard.

188
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,752
Okay. All right, my
truck's out back.

189
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,554
Okay. Oh, and they
hand me a gun.

190
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:17,257
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, put it away.

191
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:19,459
I will. I have handcuffs, too.

192
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,760
Good. Okay.

193
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,462
I got some mace.

194
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,997
Sure.

195
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:25,665
So you get in the mind
of the spider, really?

196
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,533
I do.

197
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,934
That's crazy.

198
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's a little nuts.

199
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,072
Sir, we have a location.
E.T.A. 5 minutes.

200
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,341
It's over here.

201
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:39,512
Uh-oh, the lights
don't work so good.

202
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,583
It's cold in here.

203
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:48,521
No, spiders don't like it cold.
They like it warm. Dark and warm.

204
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,956
Well, that's good.

205
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:57,964
Hey, Jorge.

206
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,566
Uh-huh.

207
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,302
Can you get my flash light?
It's in the side of my bag.

208
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:03,670
Sure.

209
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:06,939
My name's Jose. Okay? Okay.

210
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,244
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,245
What?

212
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:13,246
Oh, God.

213
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,547
What?

214
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:15,548
This is so gross.

215
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:16,549
Oh, yeah? What?

216
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,951
Look at this.

217
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:19,552
No, describe it. I'm
not going to look.

218
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:20,653
Oh, uh.

219
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:22,989
What?

220
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,975
The spider must've... oh,
he must've got inside

221
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,960
this guy's body and dug
his way out through

222
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,795
his lungs or his
stomach or something.

223
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:29,629
What?

224
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,496
Oh, my God.

225
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,298
Oh, poor guy.

226
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,500
How big did Carl say this thing was?
What did he say exactly?

227
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,235
Exactly?

228
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,303
Yeah.

229
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,301
Let me see. Uh, "He bit me, boss.
He bit me."

230
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:40,907
And then Lisa said
"It was a doggie."

231
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:44,677
He said, "No." And then I said, "Maybe
it was a black cat." He said, "No."

232
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:47,881
"Then it's a monkey."
He said, "No." He said

233
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:51,084
it was like a spider but
bigger than a spide-

234
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:54,253
Maybe it was a spider monkey.

235
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:57,857
A spider monkey?

236
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,658
A spider monkey.

237
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:20,546
Ooh, what is all this? We already called.
It was a false alarm.

238
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:23,048
No, it wasn't.

239
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:30,056
Is that, like, Raid?

240
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:36,396
Raid? No. Raid is for housewives.
This is a very potent brew,

241
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:39,226
my own concoction
of sticky acid.

242
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:43,303
A few drops on a termite
hive, and it's history.

243
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:44,671
And it's eco friendly.

244
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,306
Oh, that's nice.

245
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:51,276
Okay, if you were a spider,
where would you be?

246
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:03,690
Oh, damn it.

247
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:04,723
What?

248
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,905
Yes, I know, but I thought
it was, you know, spider...

249
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:21,741
you were scared, too. Shut up.

250
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:24,077
Where's this vent go to?

251
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:26,162
Uh, through the building,
from the roof, all

252
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:28,247
the way down to the
basement machine room.

253
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:29,749
The machine room?

254
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Yeah.

255
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,452
Where it's warm.

256
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:33,252
Ah.

257
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,487
Okay, Jose, get up there.

258
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:36,322
I'm not going to get up there.

259
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,424
Come on, man. You're a little guy.
Get in the vent.

260
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:39,826
I'm not going in there.

261
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:41,828
I'm kidding. Get my bag for me.

262
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:45,331
It's not funny, man. But, listen, are
you really going to go up there?

263
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:47,133
Yeah, that's what I do.

264
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:53,373
This is how I roll, man. There
is no bug that can outdo the Ex.

265
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,775
And besides, the bug
that we're dealing with?

266
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:56,642
Mm-hm.

267
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:57,844
Is a big bug.

268
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,846
Ah.

269
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:02,815
In my line of work, it's the little
bugs you've got to be scared of.

270
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:03,816
Oh, the little ones.

271
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,185
Yeah.

272
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:09,389
Oh, I hate little bugs. You know? I hate
gnats, mosquitoes, <i>cucarachas</i> of course.

273
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,725
I don't even like lady bugs. You
know, everybody likes lady bugs.

274
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,427
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,529
I hate roly pollies, too. I
can't stand them. Chiggers:

276
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,599
Chiggers are, like, really bad
because they get under the skin.

277
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,235
Okay. Sorry, the one we're
looking for has a mean bite.

278
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,137
You've got a lot of
elderly, sick people, kids.

279
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,039
Let's do this for the kids.

280
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,473
Let's do it for the kids.

281
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,609
All right.

282
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,378
I'll be on channel two.
I'm going to need you

283
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:33,146
to talk me through the
entire vent, okay?

284
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:37,183
All the way through the building. Wanna
make sure this thing doesn't double back

285
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,684
and come back through this way.

286
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,987
Uh, wait a minute. I don't
have the sticky acid.

287
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:44,657
Yeah, but you've got the gun,
you've got the handcuffs, the mace.

288
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:47,860
Trust me, this thing is more
scared of you than you are of it.

289
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:50,063
Huh, I don't think so.

290
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:51,748
Uh, sir, there are no cell
phones in the hospital.

291
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,433
There's a sign right there.

292
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:57,437
Set up a perimeter around the hospital.
Lieutenant, lock it down.

293
00:17:57,438 --> 00:18:01,641
Uh, that is a negative, my friend.
Repeat, not happening. We have patients-

294
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:04,110
Your hospital is now
under my command.

295
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:09,115
I'm sorry. I'm Gordon Harris, director
of the hospital. Who are you?

296
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:13,419
I am Major Braxton C. Tanner,
Special Forces, United States Army.

297
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,022
We have reason to suspect
you've inadvertently

298
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:18,624
received a very
dangerous contagion.

299
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,862
There's a body that was mistakenly
sent here to this hospital.

300
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,864
We'd like to see that body.

301
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:26,165
A contagion?

302
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,234
Now, where's the morgue?

303
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:28,821
Breaker, breaker, this is the Ex
calling El Dorado. Come in, Jose.

304
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:32,592
Uh, hi, yes, I'm here.
El Dorado, did you say?

305
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:35,762
Yeah, El Dorado. I'm
coming up to a junction,

306
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:38,931
east and west. Which
way to the basement?

307
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,236
Uh, what's a junction?

308
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:48,641
It's uh... like when two roads come are...
you know, come together in a T,

309
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:51,944
and you don't... Do I go left
or right to go to the basement?

310
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,913
Go left.

311
00:20:53,914 --> 00:20:55,214
What?

312
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:55,948
Yes.

313
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:57,617
Hello.

314
00:20:57,618 --> 00:20:59,118
Don't yell at me. Go left.

315
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,119
Left, right?

316
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,621
Yes, go left, <i>izquierda.</i>

317
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:03,055
Am I scared of what?

318
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:04,723
Go left.

319
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:08,693
Okay, I'm going left.

320
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,713
Jose, I'm not alone
in here, buddy.

321
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,451
Oh, my God.

322
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:24,270
Jose. Jose, you're not
going to believe this.

323
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:28,774
It looks like our friend has
already had a little snack.

324
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:34,880
This is unbelievable and so beautiful.
The structure's incredible, the strength.

325
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:39,351
I can't... I've never
seen anything like it.

326
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:47,692
Oh, it's so sticky.

327
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,631
It's so sticky.

328
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,970
Oh, good God.

329
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:13,485
Oh, that's not good.
That's not good.

330
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:22,694
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

331
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:33,939
Come on.

332
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,895
Oh, that was interesting.
Oh, man.

333
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:58,197
So this is where the
body would've come in.

334
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:01,100
Our morgue attendant
Carl's fallen ill, so he-

335
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,133
Fallen ill?

336
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:15,114
It is here.

337
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:19,919
Move to full lock up, people.
All units gear up.

338
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,023
So you're saying that the military can
just come in and shut a hospital down?

339
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:26,559
That's not legal.
You can't do that.

340
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,177
The hell I can't. You
are under military

341
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:29,795
jurisdiction on a matter
of national security.

342
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:33,933
Your full cooperation and discretion
would be very much appreciated.

343
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,434
Do we have an understanding?

344
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:36,469
Yep.

345
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,903
Good.

346
00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:39,238
Excuse me, Director Harris?

347
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,439
Uh, not now, Lisa.

348
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,874
Can we talk for a second?

349
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,209
Not now.

350
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,344
Something's happened.
It's one of the patients.

351
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:46,212
And?

352
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:48,380
Well, he's... Dead?

353
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,182
Let's take a look.

354
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:14,539
Ah, okay. I'm onto you, buddy.

355
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,412
It's already hunting.

356
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:28,387
Granted the patient's immobility
indicates an advantageous access,

357
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:35,294
like a buzzard selecting wounded prey.
It will get the hang of the kill quickly.

358
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:37,263
How long has it been?

359
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:42,101
Blood coagulation fresh. Ten, maybe
twelve minutes. It is close.

360
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:44,803
How big do you think
it is now, Doctor?

361
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:47,306
It has quadrupled in size.

362
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:49,575
Qua... in 24 hours?

363
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:53,576
It will continue to grow
exponentially. Four

364
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:57,576
hours from now it
will quadruple again.

365
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:18,169
Where are you, friend?

366
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:25,941
Where are you, buddy? Come on, buddy.
The Ex has

367
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,941
a treat for you. I got a...
a treat for you.

368
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:51,870
U.S. to Mexico. U.S.
to Mexico. Jose, it's Alex.

369
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,139
Copy that.

370
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,677
I think I found our spider. I'm down in the
basement, buddy. Down in the basement.

371
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,117
Okay.

372
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:13,725
Where are-

373
00:27:22,968 --> 00:27:26,521
There you are, little buddy.
Wow, you're not such a...

374
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:30,075
such a little guy, are you.

375
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:34,813
All right, I've got
something for you.

376
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:42,814
I got something for you. Nice and shiny.
You're going to like this. Ready?

377
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:55,266
That's my quarter. Give
me back my quarter!

378
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:04,809
Oh, no you don't. Not this time.

379
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:10,148
You gonna run from me?

380
00:28:15,454 --> 00:28:18,690
Ah, come on, buddy.

381
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:26,998
Get down!

382
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:38,376
What, are you trying to kill me? Hey,
they said I could be here. What are you-

383
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:41,379
Hi.

384
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:44,383
Was that the only one?

385
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:48,787
The only what? Spider?
Uh, yeah, I hope so.

386
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:50,788
Shh-shh-

387
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,098
What?

388
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,603
Oh, great, it's gone.

389
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:08,340
Yeah, nice job, moron.

390
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:09,541
Made visual contact.

391
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,210
Moron?

392
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:14,113
Target it now in the sewer system.
Prepare to move out.

393
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,447
Moron?

394
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,583
I'm bringing an eye witness
in for questioning.

395
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:20,452
Hey, I had this thing bagged until
you started shooting at me.

396
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:21,386
No.

397
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:22,988
Shooting at me.

398
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:24,757
Okay, you've got no idea
what you're dealing with.

399
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:25,624
Uh, excuse me.

400
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,592
Sorry. Sorry.

401
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:28,360
I'm a professional.

402
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:31,497
Oh, I see. I see. Of course you are.
And, hey, nice uniform.

403
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:32,531
Thank you very much.

404
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:33,565
Now, move out.

405
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,800
That was sarcastic.

406
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,135
Move out.

407
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:37,636
Are you feeling something?
'Cause-

408
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:38,536
Head out.

409
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,834
Stuck.

410
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:21,406
Did you ever see the arachnid?

411
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,709
I don't know what that is.
Did you say Iraq?

412
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,543
Arachnid.

413
00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:26,144
I like your pipe.

414
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:30,916
Major, here he is, a local exterminator.
Uh, Alex.

415
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:34,486
Alex Mathis, actually. It's
pest eradication specialist.

416
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,722
All kinds of pests,
rodents, reptiles.

417
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:38,707
All I want from you,
Mr. Mathis, is details.

418
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,692
Tell me what you saw down there.

419
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:41,994
Hey, there he is.

420
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:43,061
Hey, how you doing?

421
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,696
What's up, Jose?

422
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,498
In concise sentences, please.

423
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:49,101
Okay, can I sit down? It's
been one hell of a morning.

424
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:50,636
Yeah, we're going
to sit down, okay?

425
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:53,005
You want details?
This thing's huge.

426
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:57,376
This is the biggest spider that I've ever
seen, maybe the biggest spider on record,

427
00:31:57,377 --> 00:32:00,846
and from the look of the bite
that it gave that mortician,

428
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:04,349
I'd say this thing is highly
poisonous, aggressive, fast, smart.

429
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,687
It's strong, really strong. It moved
that sewer grate out of the way.

430
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:12,391
That's got to be about 25 pounds.
This is a big-ass spider.

431
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:15,560
Exoskeleton's hardened then.
It's already entered Stage Two.

432
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,997
All right, Major, we've got to
get it before it hits Stage.

433
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:21,333
Three and increases
in size again.

434
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,185
Increases in size? What
are you talking about?

435
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:25,037
What does that mean?
Who are you guys?

436
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:26,605
Why are you hunting a spider?

437
00:32:26,606 --> 00:32:28,707
We appreciate your time, Mr. Mathis.
Lieutenant,

438
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,443
will you escort these two
gentlemen off the premises?

439
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:34,613
No, no, no, no, no,
don't brush me off...

440
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:37,549
Hey, it's not going to stay in
the service tunnel very long.

441
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,518
You're way out of
your league, son.

442
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,320
All right.

443
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:43,555
Well, I've had worse
job interviews.

444
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:46,758
I think your boss really likes me.
I thought it went well.

445
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,759
He doesn't like games.

446
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,461
He doesn't like games?

447
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:51,029
Mm-mm.

448
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,532
Then what's with the secrecy?
Just tell us what's going on?

449
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,451
Look, we made a mistake,
and now we're taking

450
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:57,369
care of it, and that's
all you need to know.

451
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,605
No, no, no, no, no, what
does that mean, "We

452
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:01,840
made a mistake"? Like
"We" made this mistake?

453
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:06,044
I've got to get back, so why don't you two
take off before Braxton has you arrested.

454
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:07,612
Wow. Uh, Lieutenant.

455
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,581
Yes?

456
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:14,820
Just in case the military or you
should need any assistance at all...

457
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,822
...this is my card.

458
00:33:16,823 --> 00:33:18,824
Mister... Alex.

459
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,459
Alex... Mathis.

460
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,626
Mathis.

461
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,795
On Twitter it's
bad-ass bug killer.

462
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,298
If you think of anything else
important, you can give me a call.

463
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,550
Oh, so look at that. That
wasn't so difficult, was it?

464
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,802
I will definitely be
giving you a call.

465
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:32,237
All right. All right.

466
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:34,172
I appreciate it, and
I could friend you.

467
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:37,776
All right, don't let this get out.
And try to stay out of trouble.

468
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:39,778
Hm.

469
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,279
Wow.

470
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,281
Hm, what a nice lady. I
think she likes you.

471
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:45,484
Can't believe I let
this one get away.

472
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,085
She's right there. I call her.

473
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,488
No, no, no, no, no,
Jose, the spider?

474
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:51,490
Oh, yeah. Hey, but
where are you going?

475
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:52,925
What do you mean, where am I going?
This is it, buddy.

476
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:54,359
What?

477
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,528
The end of our adventure.
It's been fun.

478
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:58,930
Hey, you cannot
give up now, Alex.

479
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:01,233
You heard her. She's got
the Army working with her.

480
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:03,535
What are we supposed to do?

481
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:05,737
But isn't this, like, the
biggest spider ever?

482
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:09,741
Yes, this is, without question,
the biggest spider on record.

483
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:13,412
Yes, so it would be good business,
right, for you to catch it or kill it.

484
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:15,747
Yes, if I could catch it
or kill it, which I can't.

485
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:18,650
Okay, but it could make
you famous, right?

486
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,520
Yes, this would get a lot of press.
What are you getting at?

487
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:23,955
Look, you could be
super- exterminator.

488
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:29,127
And Jose. And my boss told me to
help you, so I'm going to help you,

489
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:34,132
and you know, like, how?
Like Robin helps the Batman.

490
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:38,837
Like Tonto helps the Lone Ranger.
Like Kato helps the Green Hornet.

491
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:40,138
Yeah.

492
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,807
Like Sancho Panza
helps Don Quixote.

493
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:43,241
Yes.

494
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:45,343
Like John Oates helps
Daryl Hall, baby.

495
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:48,680
Yes, we are going to do this. We are
going to show her that spiders don't fly.

496
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:49,514
Yes.

497
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:50,415
And spiders don't swim.

498
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,751
Yes.

499
00:34:52,752 --> 00:34:54,920
Some do, but that's not the point.
You and I are

500
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:57,089
going to find this spider
before they do. Come on.

501
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,023
Let's do it.

502
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:01,425
Wicked.

503
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:19,111
The five-mile radius should be enough.
Let's get some eyes out there.

504
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:20,512
Any sign?

505
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:23,181
Containment is our
priority right now.

506
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:26,618
We have to neutralize the target
before somebody out there sees it.

507
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,121
The mere sight of this thing
will 'cause mass panic.

508
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:31,289
Sir, we have a problem.

509
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,425
Dodd, who shot the amateur video

510
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:37,429
claims it was footage of a giant spider
measuring over six feet in length.

511
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,764
We now go live to the scene
of this strange sighting.

512
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:43,235
I saw a big-ass spider. I
came around the corner.

513
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:45,504
First thing I had to do
was get my phone out.

514
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:47,772
Ain't nobody gonna believe this...

515
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,809
I seen this spider was coming at me, man.
It had multip...

516
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,845
like, what, eight, six legs?

517
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,147
Yeah, about that.

518
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:57,149
It had multiple legs, dope.

519
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,216
It had multiple eyes.

520
00:35:58,217 --> 00:35:59,851
It was multicultured.

521
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:01,453
The fool's on crack!

522
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:03,288
If I see the spider again,
I'm gonna whoop his ass.

523
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:07,726
Are we ready to
the spider?

524
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:09,728
Yeah!

525
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:12,931
You better hide your kids, you better hide
your wife 'cause there's a big-ass...

526
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:15,767
bigger than a spi... there's
a mega-spider on the loose.

527
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:18,637
Find that building and the
connecting service tunnel.

528
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:19,538
Yes.

529
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:23,041
It is moving into Stage Three.

530
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:25,343
Thank you, Doctor. Karly.

531
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,645
I'm on it.

532
00:36:30,348 --> 00:36:33,350
We're going to need a miracle.

533
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,796
Hey, I like that song, Alex.

534
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:48,300
I like that music, too, my
friend, but we've got to focus.

535
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:52,504
You're right. Focus. Okay, so
what is the biggest spider ever?

536
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:56,575
Biggest spider ever has to
be the Goliath birdeater.

537
00:36:56,576 --> 00:37:01,246
Yeah, unbelievable. This thing's got a
six-inch abdomen, three-inch fangs,

538
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:04,883
13 inches across. But I gotta tell
you, what we're following now...

539
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:05,884
Yeah.

540
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:07,752
This thing, what I saw... Yes.

541
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:08,920
Much bigger.

542
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:09,921
Oh, come on.

543
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:10,922
I'm not kidding.

544
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:11,957
131/2 inches?

545
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:12,958
Much bigger.

546
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,192
14 inches. 141/2 inches.

547
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:14,993
Much bigger.

548
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,094
15 inches.

549
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,529
I'll meet you on the other side.

550
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,697
151/2... 16 inches?

551
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:19,297
20 inches.

552
00:37:19,298 --> 00:37:20,732
20 inches?

553
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:22,968
What I saw was 20
inches long and black.

554
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:26,737
Sounds fun.

555
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:32,376
Sir, there's a phone
call for you.

556
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,580
This is Major Tanner.

557
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:38,683
Yeah, it's Officer
Edwards with the LAPD.

558
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:41,419
Something down here you're
probably going to want to see.

559
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,421
What is your location?

560
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,423
So what is this thing?

561
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:47,926
It's probably some
cross breed of spider.

562
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,762
I don't know. It's just, like,
a gigantic black widow.

563
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:53,932
Okay, so where would
a black widow go?

564
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:58,503
Well, black widows are night feeders,
so it's going to be looking for easy

565
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:01,306
access outside the sewer
tunnels, some food supply, not a

566
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:03,008
lot of traffic, calm
area, possibly-

567
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:04,709
<i>Un río.</i>

568
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,543
What?

569
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,045
<i>Un río.</i> The river.

570
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:08,546
Yes, yes, the L.A. River.

571
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,048
Okay, let's go.

572
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:11,448
Let's go.

573
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:52,456
There. There's something.

574
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:08,772
Oh, sweet mother of God.

575
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:14,778
It built this under one hour.

576
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:23,488
Looks like it housed maybe
20 or 30 people at night.

577
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:25,990
Do you see any survivors?

578
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:33,497
No. No one left. Except
for maybe some leftovers.

579
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:40,738
A little more to
the right, please.

580
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:51,850
It has molted.

581
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,986
Center. Center Command,
this is Major Tanner.

582
00:39:54,987 --> 00:39:58,490
We are at Stage Three. I repeat.
We are at Stage Three.

583
00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:02,493
This town has no
idea what's coming.

584
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:17,208
Ah, it looks like they
beat us to the punch.

585
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,411
Yeah, but do you think
they killed it?

586
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:21,413
I don't know. I'm
about to find out.

587
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:23,515
Hello?

588
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:29,421
Hey, it's Alex. I was just wondering,
um, so you got your spider, huh?

589
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:31,222
What? Where are you?

590
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,991
Where are we?

591
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:36,194
We're right across the
river from you...

592
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:38,496
...and your soldiers. Hey.

593
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:41,499
Listen, we just missed it.
Anything else?

594
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,202
Anything else. Um-
Ask her out, man.

595
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:45,203
What?

596
00:40:45,204 --> 00:40:46,204
Ask her out, Alex.

597
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:47,205
No.

598
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:48,173
Don't be scared.

599
00:40:48,174 --> 00:40:50,375
I'm not scared.

600
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:53,244
Listen. No offense, but I don't have
time for this, all right? Good-bye, Alex.

601
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,313
I was wondering if maybe- What?
Hello.

602
00:40:55,314 --> 00:40:56,414
What happened?

603
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:57,449
Uh, spider's still on the loose.

604
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,183
Oh, it is?

605
00:40:58,184 --> 00:40:59,818
Yes.

606
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:01,586
Okay, so. Where do you think
it would go from here?

607
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,955
Well, it's going to be
looking for food and fast.

608
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,924
Thought you said
it hunts at night.

609
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:08,693
Yeah, but something this size is
going to hunt when it's hungry,

610
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:11,262
and there's nothing around
but industrial space.

611
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:13,665
It could hide in the hills.

612
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,550
Yes, it could... Yes, it's
going to be looking for

613
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,435
higher ground. Very good
guess, Señor Watson.

614
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,537
It's going to need tree cover.

615
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:22,707
You know, my cousin had a
<i>quinceañera</i> at Elysian Park.

616
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:25,210
It's Sunday. There's lots of
people there cooking out.

617
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,079
That's where I would be with my
family if I had the day off-

618
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,015
Hey, you know what? Elysian Park.
Let's try Elysian Park.

619
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:33,318
Are you serious? I just
said Elysian Park, Alex.

620
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,552
Come on. <i>Vámonos!</i>

621
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:39,650
The drone has a lock
on our target, sir.

622
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,054
Good God.

623
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:44,088
Location?

624
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:44,856
Elysian Park.

625
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,057
Get units there now.

626
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,997
Oh, stop sign, Alex.

627
00:42:52,998 --> 00:42:55,600
No, there's no slowing down.
We've got to get to the park.

628
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:57,235
Oh, there goes the stop sign.

629
00:42:57,236 --> 00:43:00,638
We have got to get to the park
and evacuate these people.

630
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:04,309
Oh, boy.

631
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,411
Oh, man. We gonna get it now.
I told you to drive slow.

632
00:43:06,412 --> 00:43:07,979
I'll do the talking, okay?

633
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,281
Yeah, hope so. You're
the white guy.

634
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:01,232
Alex, wait-Oh, man.

635
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:04,202
Listen, I'm a
professional Driver.

636
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:06,704
I'm going to need you to
step back into your vehicle.

637
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:08,806
No, no, no, but there's
something huge in the

638
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:10,908
park, and I'm just
saying we have a major-

639
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:13,111
Alex, listen to him. Okay?
Just listen to him-

640
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:15,747
Excuse me, sir, I need you
to step back inside the car.

641
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,181
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

642
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:18,783
Put your hands on
the dash board.

643
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:20,385
Okay, good luck.
Good luck, Alex.

644
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:21,753
Back inside the car.

645
00:44:21,754 --> 00:44:23,321
I understand what
this is all about.

646
00:44:23,322 --> 00:44:25,490
What's going on in the park today?
You got a picnic?

647
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,693
All right, maybe I should just
donate to the officer's fund. Huh?

648
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:30,094
Is that right?

649
00:44:30,095 --> 00:44:31,529
Huh? Is that what
it's going to take?

650
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,864
Is that... Is that what this is?

651
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:34,265
That's exactly what that is.

652
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:35,867
A donation to the
officer's fund.

653
00:44:35,868 --> 00:44:37,368
Yes, siree. Can I go now?

654
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:39,404
This is a 12... $12 donation.
Seriously, man?

655
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:41,072
Yeah, this is all I got.

656
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:42,940
Twelve dollars? Sir, I'd
like for you to turn around.

657
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:44,542
Turn around? I'm a professional.

658
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:47,345
Put your... Turn around, put
your hands on the car, please.

659
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:50,148
There are hundreds if not
thousands of people in the park..

660
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,784
Their lives depend on us getting there.
-Is that right?

661
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:54,419
Yes, absolutely.

662
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,487
All units, all units, please
report to Elysian Park.

663
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:57,689
Yeah.

664
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,457
There's a disturbance
in progress.

665
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,191
Okay.

666
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:01,025
Huh? Huh?

667
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:02,193
Elysian... Elysian Park?

668
00:45:02,194 --> 00:45:04,462
Oh, look at that. Okay, go! Go!

669
00:45:04,463 --> 00:45:06,564
Don't... Don't be waving me off. You
better get out of here, all right?

670
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:07,532
This works. This works.

671
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:09,800
Can I have my bribe back?

672
00:46:58,576 --> 00:46:59,577
Hey, what are you doing?

673
00:46:59,578 --> 00:47:00,912
I'm going to ram it.

674
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:01,879
Oh. What?

675
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
Yes.

676
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:03,781
No, you're joking.

677
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:04,916
Yes!

678
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:19,564
Go! Go! Go!

679
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:22,866
I'm going as fast as I can.

680
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:40,551
Are you okay? Are you okay?

681
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:41,586
No.

682
00:47:41,587 --> 00:47:42,587
Are you okay?

683
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:43,654
No.

684
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:44,889
You're not okay?

685
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,957
No, I'm not okay.

686
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,091
Okay.

687
00:47:47,092 --> 00:47:48,559
Who in the hell is that idiot?

688
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,594
That's Alex Mathis.

689
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:50,928
The exterminator?

690
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:52,196
Yes, sir.

691
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:55,031
He's going to get
himself killed.

692
00:47:58,237 --> 00:47:59,036
What?

693
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:04,108
Okay, listen. Enough of this. Your
Spanglish is pressuring me. All right?

694
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,510
I can't go on.

695
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:07,912
Hello, Western Exterminator.
We care.

696
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:09,981
Alex, this is Lieutenant Brandt.

697
00:48:09,982 --> 00:48:11,466
Hey, Karly, how are you?
We're onto your spider.

698
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:12,950
We're in Elysian Park.

699
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:15,987
Listen, we're here, Alex. Get clear.
We're going to handle this.

700
00:48:15,988 --> 00:48:19,156
Uh, no, no, we're going to take
care of the spider, and then I

701
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:21,325
am going to take
you out to dinner.

702
00:48:21,326 --> 00:48:24,195
Alex, I'm not joking. You're
heading right into a crossfire.

703
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,963
I'm sorry. We're
heading into a what?

704
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:26,931
A crossfire.

705
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:27,899
A crossfire. What's a...

706
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,966
A crossfire? What's a...

707
00:48:34,906 --> 00:48:37,674
All right, on my command.

708
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:41,645
Open fire!

709
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:04,100
My truck!

710
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:39,136
You son of a bitch!

711
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:41,105
Alex, don't!

712
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:51,148
Are you insane? What
were you thinking?

713
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:52,850
Hey, did you miss me?

714
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:54,385
You could've been killed.

715
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:56,354
Well, we just thought we'd
bring the spider to you.

716
00:49:56,355 --> 00:49:59,724
I don't have time to deal with this clown.
Get him out of my sight.

717
00:49:59,725 --> 00:50:00,624
Yes, sir.

718
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:02,626
You're welcome.

719
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:05,696
Keep him out of our way. Lieutenant,
regroup the men and form a perimeter.

720
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:07,431
Yes.

721
00:50:07,432 --> 00:50:09,834
I want to kill that bastard
while it's still in the woods.

722
00:50:09,835 --> 00:50:10,968
Yes, Major.

723
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:11,969
And get some more men up here.

724
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:12,970
Hey, I lost my truck.

725
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,172
Uh, I lost my glasses.

726
00:50:15,173 --> 00:50:16,941
You will need more firepower.
There's enough

727
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:18,709
explosive in here
to take out a tank.

728
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,344
Thank you.

729
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:22,346
I lost my truck. You're
worried about your glasses?

730
00:50:22,347 --> 00:50:24,347
I'm... yeah, you're right.

731
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:40,765
Hey, Karly, what about me?

732
00:50:40,766 --> 00:50:42,566
What about you?

733
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,802
Well, should I come with you?
Jose and I can be our own unit.

734
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:46,771
Yeah, I shot it a whole bunch.

735
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:49,607
All right, listen, guys. Seriously
I've really appreciated everything

736
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:51,809
you've done, but we've
got it from here. Okay?

737
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,210
Wait, Karly.

738
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:54,779
You guys, listen. You
guys did a great job.

739
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,647
Thank you. Karly,
you need my help.

740
00:50:56,648 --> 00:50:59,150
Alex, what I've got to
do now is move out.

741
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:00,818
You and your men are about
to walk into a death trap.

742
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:02,486
The wooded area's her terrain.

743
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:06,057
This is home turf advantage for her.
They don't call her one of the greatest

744
00:51:06,058 --> 00:51:10,227
predators on earth for nothing. Trust me.
Karly, you need my help

745
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:14,632
Alex, this is my job.

746
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:17,568
How come women never
listen to me?

747
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:19,235
What?

748
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:50,400
Stay sharp, boys.

749
00:51:55,372 --> 00:51:58,926
Now, if you come across
a hide or lair, your

750
00:51:58,927 --> 00:52:02,480
first priority is to
drop the thermite pack

751
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:09,486
and fall back immediately. All
detonation will be signaled from here.

752
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,876
Look out. Look out!

753
00:52:41,385 --> 00:52:43,687
Where's Balzda? Where's Balzda?

754
00:52:43,688 --> 00:52:47,391
We lost all of Alpha company.
Lon's camera's down, too, sir.

755
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:50,326
Target acquired.
Target acquired.

756
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:53,329
Engage.

757
00:53:11,015 --> 00:53:12,816
Sir, we lost Private Parker.

758
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:16,619
Send teams Delta,
Echo, Foxtrot now.

759
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:33,904
Damn. Guys, I'm stuck.

760
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:37,907
Yeah, well, I'm stuck
in this stuff, too.

761
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:43,163
Okay, it's... Charlie One.
It's... Charlie One.

762
00:53:43,164 --> 00:53:45,915
We need immediate backup now.

763
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:00,130
Lieutenant Brandt.

764
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:01,265
Yes, sir.

765
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:03,033
If it gets in your vicinity...

766
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:08,806
...and you have a chance to end
this, are you prepared to do so?

767
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:11,407
Yes, sir.

768
00:54:23,921 --> 00:54:28,125
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.
Quiet. Quiet.

769
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:30,628
Hi. What are you doing here?

770
00:54:30,629 --> 00:54:33,230
I'm saving your ass. What do
you think I'm doing here?

771
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,398
Be careful. Be careful.

772
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:35,466
I know. I know.

773
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:37,267
Oh, my God.

774
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:43,140
Come on, hurry, hurry. Get me out.
Get me out.

775
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:45,376
I am. I am.

776
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:49,446
If I just heat the knife, we should be
able to cut right through it. Hold still.

777
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:51,849
Here... Here we go.

778
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:52,850
Yes.

779
00:54:52,851 --> 00:54:54,652
Okay, thank you.

780
00:54:54,653 --> 00:54:56,886
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

781
00:54:57,888 --> 00:55:01,792
Okay, we've got to keep moving.
And don't stop moving.

782
00:55:01,793 --> 00:55:03,027
Okay.

783
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:07,464
Okay... whoa, whoa, whoa, keep moving.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

784
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:09,967
Okay, I have a contingency plan.

785
00:55:09,968 --> 00:55:11,335
Yeah, what's that?

786
00:55:11,336 --> 00:55:13,270
You see this pack on my back?
Yeah?

787
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,239
Yeah.

788
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,808
It's filled with explosives that'll
blow that thing a mile high.

789
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:19,927
That's not good! If you
blow that thing a mile

790
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:22,046
high, you're going to
blow us a mile high.

791
00:55:22,047 --> 00:55:24,214
I'm sorry, Alex.

792
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:27,017
What? Are you kidding me? The girl of
my dreams wanna kill me on my day off?

793
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:29,086
This is great.
Please don't do it!

794
00:55:37,394 --> 00:55:38,696
Go! Go! Go! Go!

795
00:55:38,697 --> 00:55:40,331
Come one. We gotta go.
Let's get out-

796
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,436
Come on. Come on!

797
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:48,806
Come on, Karly!

798
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,607
I'm coming.

799
00:55:56,113 --> 00:55:57,914
Karly!

800
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:03,419
No!

801
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:22,906
Oh, my God.

802
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:25,409
I'm sorry, guys. Sorry, Alex.

803
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,649
Sorry, Alex? What do you mean, sorry Alex?
What's the plan, guys?

804
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:30,814
We gotta rescue her.
You're kidding, Alex.

805
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:32,316
Kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.

806
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:34,251
She's as good as dead.
Let's move on.

807
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:36,720
No! Wh-What are we all? We're just
numbers to you guys? Is that it?

808
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:40,057
Hey, Braxton, come on. What is this?
It's just collateral damage?

809
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:42,993
Lieutenant Brandt and I went
through hell and back to get her,

810
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:46,796
so don't tell me about
losing a friend.

811
00:56:47,998 --> 00:56:53,270
She was a good soldier, and her
death will not be in vain.

812
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:56,473
Now, we're running out of time.
It's still out there.

813
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:59,476
And about to run amok
into Stage Five.

814
00:56:59,477 --> 00:57:02,678
St... Okay. What-What's
Stage Five?

815
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:09,987
Doc, what happens in Stage Five?
Come on.

816
00:57:09,988 --> 00:57:12,990
This is not the first time you
guys have dealt with this.

817
00:57:12,991 --> 00:57:15,692
What did you make that is
running around killing people?

818
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:19,062
We didn't make anything, at
least not intentionally.

819
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:25,769
This arachnid is an aberration
from several unusual technologies.

820
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:30,240
Come on. In layman's terms,
what are we dealing with?

821
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:34,044
Alien biology, not terrestrial.

822
00:57:34,045 --> 00:57:36,947
So you're saying the
spider's an alien?

823
00:57:36,948 --> 00:57:39,049
Yeah.

824
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:42,803
Not exactly, but yes.
DNA cross breeding

825
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:46,557
from microbial fossil
found in Martian soil.

826
00:57:46,558 --> 00:57:50,961
So you made a spider do it with an alien.
That's messed up.

827
00:57:50,962 --> 00:57:52,763
No, no, no.

828
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,965
That's messed up, guys.
This is your people, Alex.

829
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:58,168
No, no, no, we did cross
breed two species.

830
00:57:58,169 --> 00:58:03,941
We isolated separate genes,
one of which, in particular,

831
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:10,814
produces a superior growth hormone.
It's promise is infinite.

832
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,117
Giant tomatoes to feed the
whole world and such.

833
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:17,321
"Tomatoes" is the first word
I understood. You know?

834
00:58:17,322 --> 00:58:20,324
But something went wrong.

835
00:58:20,325 --> 00:58:21,325
No kidding.

836
00:58:21,326 --> 00:58:23,026
I got a question for you.

837
00:58:23,027 --> 00:58:24,761
Yes.

838
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:27,064
So why do we got the giant spider?
I don't get it. You get it?

839
00:58:27,065 --> 00:58:29,166
I don't get it. What's
with the spider, doc?

840
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:31,134
We don't get it. You
get it, Braxton?

841
00:58:31,135 --> 00:58:35,873
It was an accident. One of the
fruit plants that were brought

842
00:58:35,874 --> 00:58:42,779
in as a test subject had a spider's nest
hidden inside. The arachnid biology...

843
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,083
...was immediately responsive
to our growth hormone.

844
00:58:46,084 --> 00:58:49,620
Major and I monitored
four stages of growth.

845
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:55,826
Letting it proceed to Stage
Five was deemed unacceptable.

846
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:59,061
What happens in Stage Five?

847
00:58:59,763 --> 00:59:02,999
What happens in Stage Five?

848
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:06,069
Reproduction.

849
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:10,070
Of course. Reproduction. I
should've guessed that.

850
00:59:10,071 --> 00:59:14,070
Yes, of course reproduction.

851
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:18,215
It would have to be
reproduction, right?

852
00:59:18,216 --> 00:59:21,218
Because this fairytale has got
spiders from Mars, right?

853
00:59:21,219 --> 00:59:24,721
It's a nice little bedtime story
to tell us you're telling us.

854
00:59:24,722 --> 00:59:26,056
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
00:59:26,057 --> 00:59:27,724
You got spiders
humping each other.

856
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,762
Alex, even with our
high-tech equipment, you

857
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:33,497
managed to find it the
same time we did.

858
00:59:33,498 --> 00:59:34,531
Yes, I did.

859
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:35,399
No, wait. We did. Okay?

860
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,934
Right.

861
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:38,068
Correct?

862
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:39,369
You seem to understand
its nature.

863
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,437
Yes, I do.

864
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:42,205
So what's your best guess?

865
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:45,509
Oh, so now you want our help, huh?
School them, Alex.

866
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:50,480
All right, my professional opinion
is that without question,

867
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:56,687
she's going to lay her eggs as far away
from a populated area as she can get.

868
00:59:56,688 --> 01:00:00,090
Humans she doesn't trust.
She never has.

869
01:00:00,091 --> 01:00:03,160
So you're not going to find her
anywhere near a populated area.

870
01:00:03,161 --> 01:00:05,796
What, like under a bridge
or a warehouse or s...

871
01:00:05,797 --> 01:00:07,564
No, no, even more isolated.
Far away.

872
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:08,999
Sir, sir.

873
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,100
Far away.

874
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,102
Sir, I think you
need to see this.

875
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:15,272
We have a live feed of
Newscopter 8 that has spotted...

876
01:00:15,273 --> 01:00:17,407
...the creature headed
toward Little Tokyo.

877
01:00:17,408 --> 01:00:20,510
We advise you that if you are in
that area to evacuate immediately.

878
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:21,745
Or she might go downtown.

879
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:23,380
Oh, l-look. It's right there.

880
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:24,114
Found her.

881
01:00:24,115 --> 01:00:25,247
It's big.

882
01:00:41,298 --> 01:00:44,301
It appears to be climbing
up the top of City Hall.

883
01:00:44,302 --> 01:00:47,971
The size of it is just unbelievable.
It also appears to be hostile.

884
01:00:47,972 --> 01:00:51,774
If you are in the
downtown area...

885
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:30,080
All right, son, this is Tanner. Request
status on Operation Ground Swell.

886
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:32,082
Call in an air strike, Major.

887
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,284
Wait. Air strike?
What air strike?

888
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:35,185
Contingency.

889
01:01:35,186 --> 01:01:36,720
You can't just drop a bomb here.

890
01:01:36,721 --> 01:01:38,221
Oh, that's not good.

891
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:40,624
No, you can't... you
can't bomb downtown L.A.

892
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:44,327
We're running a little low on options,
so I'm calling in a targeted air strike.

893
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:46,630
You're risking the lives
of thousands of people.

894
01:01:46,631 --> 01:01:48,098
Saving millions.

895
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:50,400
Wait a minute. There's
got to be a better way.

896
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:53,603
Enough of this. Remove
this Western Terminator.

897
01:01:53,604 --> 01:01:55,205
What?

898
01:01:55,206 --> 01:01:57,374
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see
you try it, pretty guy.

899
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,575
Oh, Okay. You got it.

900
01:01:58,576 --> 01:02:01,711
Okay, we're leaving.

901
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:13,756
Sir, we have a lock
on the building.

902
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:19,061
Zooming in.

903
01:02:26,203 --> 01:02:28,971
Is that Lieutenant Brandt?

904
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:34,778
I need a minute.

905
01:02:34,779 --> 01:02:36,779
Copy that.

906
01:02:40,584 --> 01:02:42,586
I hope you have insurance.

907
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:45,088
The company has insurance, yes.

908
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:46,556
Well, don't worry about it-

909
01:02:46,557 --> 01:02:49,025
Alex, wait. It's Karly.
She's still alive.

910
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:50,994
Don't mess with me.

911
01:02:50,995 --> 01:02:53,930
That spider, she laid her eggs on
top of the Epic Bank Building.

912
01:02:53,931 --> 01:02:57,200
There are a lot of people trapped up there.
Karly's one of them.

913
01:02:57,201 --> 01:02:59,202
Okay, so what do we do?

914
01:02:59,203 --> 01:03:01,438
Well, you have about 24 minutes
before the jets arrive there.

915
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:03,974
And what happens before
then is up to you.

916
01:03:03,975 --> 01:03:05,475
I'll drive.

917
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:09,545
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

918
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,252
Okay, so what's the plan, Alex?

919
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:19,756
The plan: Stop the spider,
save the city, kiss the girl.

920
01:03:19,757 --> 01:03:23,460
Oh, good. Any idea
how to do that?

921
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:25,060
No.

922
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,564
That's what I thought.

923
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:42,913
Our guns are doing nothing
against this thing.

924
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:48,919
Disengage. Disengage. Pull back,
but maintain visual contact.

925
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,422
See, it's a perfect target up there.
If we can take it out on the rooftop,

926
01:03:52,423 --> 01:03:54,758
it'll keep civilian
casualties to a minimum.

927
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:59,028
As long as we take out that
building before the eggs hatch.

928
01:04:46,376 --> 01:04:48,578
So can I ask you
something else, Alex?

929
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:50,080
Sure. Go, Mexican Robin.

930
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:52,382
How are we going to
kill this big spider?

931
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:55,719
I'm trying to figure that one out.
I mean, we can't shoot it.

932
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,821
Why?

933
01:04:57,822 --> 01:05:00,423
Why? Because it's huge. The exoskeleton
alone is stronger than anything

934
01:05:00,424 --> 01:05:02,592
we've got to penetrate it, and
it's resistant to flames.

935
01:05:02,593 --> 01:05:04,761
It's resistant to
any kind of heat.

936
01:05:04,762 --> 01:05:07,764
We have not even created a
fire suit strong enough to-

937
01:05:07,765 --> 01:05:09,165
Fire, eh? How about <i>fuego</i>?

938
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:10,767
No, no, I just said
it's resistant to fire.

939
01:05:10,768 --> 01:05:13,703
Yes, but the web catches on
fire, so can we use that?

940
01:05:13,704 --> 01:05:14,437
Wait a minute.

941
01:05:14,438 --> 01:05:15,405
What?

942
01:05:15,406 --> 01:05:16,706
Wait a minute. That's it. Jose!

943
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:18,775
What?

944
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:21,645
If we can ignite the spinneret, we
can blow it up from the inside out.

945
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:22,345
Really?

946
01:05:22,346 --> 01:05:23,113
Yes!

947
01:05:23,114 --> 01:05:23,947
What's a spinneret?

948
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:24,748
Spinnerets.

949
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:25,749
Spinnerets.

950
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,750
Spin.

951
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:27,484
Spin.

952
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:28,485
Spin.

953
01:05:28,486 --> 01:05:31,054
Er... er... ...ets.

954
01:05:31,055 --> 01:05:32,088
...ets.

955
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:33,123
Spinnerets.

956
01:05:33,124 --> 01:05:34,758
Where's the spinnerets?

957
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:36,226
In its ass.

958
01:05:36,227 --> 01:05:37,694
So we have to shoot the
spider in the butt.

959
01:05:37,695 --> 01:05:38,662
In the butt.

960
01:05:38,663 --> 01:05:39,663
How we going to do that?

961
01:05:39,664 --> 01:05:40,764
That's right.

962
01:05:40,765 --> 01:05:41,731
Uh, how we going to do that?

963
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:42,766
With this.

964
01:05:42,767 --> 01:05:43,767
Oh, baby.

965
01:05:43,768 --> 01:05:45,068
Right?

966
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:48,137
Wicked.

967
01:05:52,108 --> 01:05:53,576
Where's the air strike?

968
01:05:53,577 --> 01:05:54,844
E.T.A. two minutes.

969
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:57,213
Have them circle once more.

970
01:05:57,214 --> 01:06:00,517
You are insane, Braxton.
You can't risk these

971
01:06:00,518 --> 01:06:03,820
eggs hatching. Take
down that building now.

972
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:07,524
I'm done with you scientists.
You started this thing.

973
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:10,026
Now, you let us finish it.
Remove this man.

974
01:06:10,027 --> 01:06:12,729
Escort him out of my
command center now.

975
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,732
I will see you in hell, Braxton.

976
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:17,967
Get me Alex on the phone.

977
01:06:23,641 --> 01:06:25,175
Western. We live to kill.

978
01:06:25,176 --> 01:06:27,711
Alex, you have 10 minutes
to get to the 60th floor.

979
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:31,281
After that I have no choice. We can't
risk any of those eggs hatching.

980
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:34,216
Ten minutes is all
we're going to need.

981
01:06:37,921 --> 01:06:39,622
Look out. Look out!

982
01:07:39,549 --> 01:07:41,083
No, no.

983
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:43,787
Jose! Hey, Jose!

984
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:52,228
Okay, I've got to go save Karly.
I've got to go save those people.

985
01:07:52,229 --> 01:07:53,596
I'm coming with you.

986
01:07:53,597 --> 01:07:56,232
No, we may not get out
of there in time.

987
01:07:56,233 --> 01:08:01,336
Then we better get moving.
Let's do it, Alex.

988
01:08:24,327 --> 01:08:26,629
Air strike E.T.A.
five minutes away.

989
01:08:46,783 --> 01:08:48,084
E.T.A. three minutes.

990
01:08:48,085 --> 01:08:50,385
God help us all.

991
01:09:08,772 --> 01:09:11,841
We're gonna kill some spiders.
Gonna kill some spiders dead.

992
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:16,880
We're gonna kills some spiders. Gonna
shoot those muthas in the head.

993
01:09:25,188 --> 01:09:27,189
And stop.

994
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:29,192
That's pretty good.

995
01:09:29,193 --> 01:09:30,926
That was all right.

996
01:09:32,128 --> 01:09:33,363
Let's do this. You ready?

997
01:09:33,364 --> 01:09:34,197
I'm ready.

998
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:35,832
You nervous?

999
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:36,966
Yes.

1000
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:38,134
It's good that you're nervous.

1001
01:09:38,969 --> 01:09:41,170
Let's do this.

1002
01:09:58,288 --> 01:10:02,192
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. This is what
I was afraid of. She's laid her eggs.

1003
01:10:02,193 --> 01:10:03,693
Holy <i>juevos.</i>

1004
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:05,061
Oh, look at this.

1005
01:10:05,062 --> 01:10:06,095
Oh, man.

1006
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:07,764
Alex!

1007
01:10:07,765 --> 01:10:08,765
Karly.

1008
01:10:08,766 --> 01:10:10,066
Alex!

1009
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:11,100
She's alive.

1010
01:10:11,101 --> 01:10:12,669
You were right.

1011
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,771
I'm going to go help her.
You help these people.

1012
01:10:14,772 --> 01:10:16,973
Okay, I will.

1013
01:10:16,974 --> 01:10:19,326
There you go. Go towards
the exit on the left,

1014
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:21,678
there's a lot of spiders
on the right. Okay

1015
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:22,812
Alex!

1016
01:10:22,813 --> 01:10:25,114
Okay, I'm right here.
Right here.

1017
01:10:25,115 --> 01:10:28,318
Just promise me this is the last time that
I'm going to have to rescue you today.

1018
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:30,253
I mean, seriously, two
saves in one day.

1019
01:10:30,254 --> 01:10:31,787
Hurry.

1020
01:10:37,994 --> 01:10:38,995
Alex! Alex!

1021
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:40,729
I got it.

1022
01:10:47,637 --> 01:10:49,204
Nice.

1023
01:10:49,472 --> 01:10:51,406
Oh, boy.

1024
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:56,746
Here they come. Time to go!

1025
01:10:56,747 --> 01:10:59,249
Help me! Oh, my God, help me!

1026
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:02,986
I need a hand. I need a hand!

1027
01:11:02,987 --> 01:11:05,255
Oh, my God, she's dead.

1028
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:08,725
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1029
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:10,426
Alex!

1030
01:11:10,427 --> 01:11:16,265
Come on, Alex! Clear out!
Clear out!

1031
01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:20,969
Come on, Alex!

1032
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,806
Thank you for calling Western.

1033
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:32,148
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1034
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,254
Nice shot.

1035
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:41,958
Yeah, well, now we're even.

1036
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:43,960
No, not quite.

1037
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:45,261
What?

1038
01:11:48,398 --> 01:11:50,099
We're out of time.

1039
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,701
Engage target. Engage target.

1040
01:12:10,186 --> 01:12:12,989
Yes!

1041
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:16,491
Well, let's not
celebrate just yet.

1042
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:26,502
So how much you gonna charge
for killing the big spider?

1043
01:12:26,503 --> 01:12:29,539
I don't know, but I hope it
covers the cost of a new truck.

1044
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,674
Yes, he is. The major
wants to talk to you.

1045
01:12:31,675 --> 01:12:33,209
Major? Hope I'm not in trouble.

1046
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:34,877
I hope not either.

1047
01:12:34,878 --> 01:12:36,979
Yeah, Major?

1048
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:39,232
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
You knocked it

1049
01:12:39,233 --> 01:12:41,484
out of the park. Thank
you for saving Karly.

1050
01:12:41,485 --> 01:12:46,189
Well, thank you very much, sir.
I told you I'm a professional.

1051
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,492
That you are, son. That you are.

1052
01:12:49,493 --> 01:12:53,196
Yeah, well, any time you have any
trouble, you know who to call,

1053
01:12:53,197 --> 01:12:56,232
except it's not going to be cheap.
I've got a partner now.

1054
01:12:58,535 --> 01:13:00,420
And there's a little
business about my, uh...

1055
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,305
my truck. I made some
modifications to it.

1056
01:13:02,306 --> 01:13:04,240
Alex.

1057
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:07,377
And I'm not sure that the insurance
at the company's going to cover it.

1058
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:09,077
Alex.

1059
01:13:16,786 --> 01:13:18,788
Major, I'm going to
have to call you back.

1060
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:21,290
Alex, can we get out of here?

1061
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:25,093
I'm sorry, Jose. I live to kill.

1062
01:13:25,995 --> 01:13:27,028
Okay.

1063
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:30,532
I got your back, babe.

1064
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:32,235
Hey, Jose.

1065
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:34,003
What?

1066
01:13:34,004 --> 01:13:36,606
You remember that conversation
we had in the... in the truck?

1067
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:37,707
Which one?

1068
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:39,075
The one about the spinneret.

1069
01:13:39,076 --> 01:13:41,711
We're going to shoot
it in the butt.

1070
01:13:41,712 --> 01:13:42,945
Find me that bazooka!

1071
01:13:42,946 --> 01:13:45,514
You got it, Alex.

1072
01:13:51,454 --> 01:13:54,456
You want some of the Ex?

1073
01:14:01,097 --> 01:14:03,698
Alex! I'm coming.

1074
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,543
Throw it to me.

1075
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:16,611
Watch out, Alex! Wake up, Alex!

1076
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:32,127
Up yours.

1077
01:14:58,321 --> 01:15:00,622
Yeah!

1078
01:15:14,437 --> 01:15:16,172
Nicely done.

1079
01:15:16,173 --> 01:15:20,409
I told you I'm a pro. I'm a pro.
Oh, look at you, you're gross.

1080
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,511
Oh.

1081
01:15:21,512 --> 01:15:23,412
You've got web all over you.

1082
01:15:23,413 --> 01:15:25,081
You're one to talk.

1083
01:15:25,082 --> 01:15:27,316
Well, it looks like we're
stuck together for a while.

1084
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:28,718
Is that a problem?

1085
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,353
No, I don't have a
problem with that.

1086
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:33,422
Well, what should you do with
the rest of your day off?

1087
01:15:33,423 --> 01:15:36,091
I can think of a few things.

1088
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:45,468
All right, you guys.

1089
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:50,739
Okay. Hey, come on, guys.
Get a room. Okay?

1090
01:16:11,794 --> 01:16:15,794
Alex, I'm afraid we
have a little problem.

1091
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:19,819
What's the biggest
cockroach you ever saw?

1092
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,070
