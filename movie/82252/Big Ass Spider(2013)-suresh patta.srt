2
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:32,065
Oh, thank goodness.
Stay, Mrs. Butterworth.

3
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:35,486
Stay, damn you! Stay!
Stay! Stay!

4
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,137
Good morning,
Mrs. Jefferson.

5
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,718
How are you? Oh. Oh!

6
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,788
How are you?
Oh, you're shaking.

7
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:46,525
Thank you for coming.
Okay.

8
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,349
Thank you for coming.
Oh, that's all right.

9
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:50,961
On your day off especially.
Oh, come on. Are you kidding me?

10
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,687
Where is it, out back?
It's in the trap.

11
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,055
In the where?
In the trap.

12
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,690
Okay. All right, it's okay.

13
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,545
Thank you for coming on your day off.
I got our little friend..

14
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:06,892
Is it ugly?

15
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,682
Is it ugly?
They're all beautiful to me.

16
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:17,406
Kept us up all night long with its ruckus.
Didn't it, Mrs. Butterworth?

17
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,160
Butterworthless when it
comes to catching critters.

18
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:23,721
At 5:06 A.M. I heard that trap
shut, and

19
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:26,808
I called you ASAP.
You're on my speed dial.

20
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,653
I know, Ann.

21
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,890
I hope you rot in hell,
you filthy vermin!

22
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:31,896
Okay, I'm going to set it
loose in the park, okay?

23
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:35,653
Yeah, set it loose in the park.
Break his neck first

24
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,402
Alex?
Alex.

25
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:41,382
Yeah.

26
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,172
I am... I'm just...
I'm so embarrassed.

27
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,924
The darned government
was late with my Social

28
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:50,897
Security check again,
so I brought you this.

29
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,007
Oh.

30
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:55,590
A little sugar.
That is so sweet of you. Thank you.

31
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:59,919
It's full of maraschino cherries,
and I left off the stems this time.

32
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:02,466
Wow. Well, you can never count
on the government for anything,

33
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,129
but you can always count on me.
My favorite client.

34
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:08,234
You are such a nice guy.

35
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,635
Ah, well...
How come...

36
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,697
...a nice guy like
you is still single?

37
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,433
I ask myself that same
question every day.

38
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,350
I guess I just haven't met
the right girl yet.

39
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:24,397
When you do...
... she's going to be exhausted.

40
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:29,217
That was awkward. Okay, bye, Mrs. J.
I'll see-

41
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,336
Alex, Alex.
Yeah.

42
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,904
You have a spider on your arm.
What? Oh, that's a tattoo.

43
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:35,804
A spider. No, no, no, no.
A spider is on your arm.

44
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:39,604
Oh, look at that. Look at that.
Oh, that's a brown recluse.

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,859
This is highly poisonous.
As long as you don't

46
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,366
provoke it, so we just
have to stay calm. Okay?

47
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,033
Let me help you.

48
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,680
Remain calm, okay?
Let me help you. I can-

49
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,346
No, no, stay calm means
I don't need your help.

50
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,068
Okay, let me help you.

51
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:51,600
No, don't help me. You just stay calm.
No, Mrs. J. No-

52
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:02,776
Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender.

53
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,187
Was that a dead body?
Let's not focus on that, Mister...

54
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:15,432
Mathis. Was that one of
your patients, Nurse...

55
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:18,938
Lisa? I mean,
I-I don't care.

56
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,892
I'm not saying that you
were responsible for that,

57
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:23,143
but being your next patient
I was just a little concerned.

58
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:29,295
You know, I would imagine, if
I looked up the word "nurse",

59
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:32,345
<i>in let's say, Nurse Journal or Nurse
Illustrated or whatever it is,</i>

60
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,488
that I would probably
see a picture of you.

61
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:36,588
I mean, you are, like,
the perfect nurse.

62
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,414
Are you done?
Okay.

63
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,345
Okay, so it says here you
have a small

64
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,562
puncture wound on your upper arm.

65
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:45,700
Correct.

66
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,723
Can you remove your shirt, please?
Sure.

67
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,515
It might be a bullet
wound, though, actually,

68
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:52,433
because I'm dodging bullets
all day long in what I do.

69
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,043
And what is it that you do?

70
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:58,182
Um, well, I actually-

71
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:04,865
Ow, ow. I, uh... Actually,
I shouldn't tell you. It's top secret.

72
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:09,549
I'd say you're a comedian,
but the shirt gives you away

73
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,298
So do your work boots.

74
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,719
Well, Mr. Mathis, it looks
like one of your bugs bit you.

75
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,458
From the swelling,
I'd say a spider.

76
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,980
You know what? You'd be right.
It was a brown recluse.

77
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:23,578
All right, let's just do 1/10 cc
of Dexamethasone or cortisone,

78
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,207
whatever you want.
It's not my first barbecue.

79
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:31,669
Okay, let me check that with the doctor.
I'll be giving you these shots myself.

80
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:33,466
Then you'll be out fighting
bugs again in no time.

81
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:40,251
Uh, nurse... Lisa... let's say for
a second that this is lethal,

82
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:43,980
and, you know, I've
only got one meal left.

83
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,461
What do you say, you,
me, breakfast? Huh?

84
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:53,312
No.
No.

85
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:06,052
<i>It's too early for this crap</i>

86
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:10,013
<i>and need some
help from the captain.</i>

87
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,892
Jeez.

88
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:46,205
$200 for gauze? Seriously, I
hope they accept fruitcake as

89
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,500
payment because I don't
know what I'm going to do.

90
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:56,010
Okay, everybody calm down.
It's just a fire alarm.

91
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:59,428
Walk out, please.
Slowly. Let's go, sir.

92
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:00,667
Don't worry.
Don't be scared.

93
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,194
It's okay, don't run.
Slowly, slowly.

94
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:07,370
Okay, it's fine, folks.
It's fine. Everything's fine.

95
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,991
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please.

96
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,451
<i>Uh, this is a false alarm.
It is a false one, folks.</i>

97
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,897
<i>There's no fire
in the building,</i>

98
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,339
<i>so if we could all just remain
calm, that would be great.</i>

99
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,991
Jose, I need you to turn
the damn thing off.

100
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:21,568
Okay, you got it, boss.
Thank you.

101
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,494
Are you okay?

102
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:24,510
You know what? I can help
them out if you want.

103
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,435
You want me to help them out?
No, we're okay. We're fine.

104
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,542
You sure?
Yeah, we got it.

105
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,006
Excuse me, Director?
Yes.

106
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,999
Carl has something very crazy to say.
There's something in the morgue.

107
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:37,578
It climbed right out of a body bag,
and it bit me. I swear to Christ.

108
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:40,127
Like the... Like the
living dead, Carl?

109
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:42,032
Jose, please.
Sorry, I like those movies.

110
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,917
Carl, what the hell are you talking about?
Did you pull the fire alarm again?

111
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,413
Hell, yes.
Didn't you hear what I said?

112
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:48,793
There's some sort of
animal that's down here.

113
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:53,208
Okay, but, Carl, you work at a hospital.
If something bites you,

114
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:56,451
there's doctors and nurses everywhere.
There's no reason for you to pull a fire

115
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,746
alarm and alert the
entire building.

116
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,693
But it bit me, boss. It bit me.
Maybe somebody brought in a dog.

117
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:07,240
It's not a dog. Listen, I know how this
sounds, but you should have seen it.

118
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,463
It's got these long black
legs, like a spider,

119
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:12,376
but it's much too big to be a spider.
We've got to call somebody.

120
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:14,616
Look, if it was bigger than a
spider, it wasn't a spider.

121
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,375
I'm sure.
A black cat, maybe, Carl.

122
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,084
It's too big to be a
Call somebody.

123
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:18,809
Was it a monkey?

124
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,153
Why would it be a monkey?
I don't know.

125
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:23,866
Could've been a spider. Carl, right?
Okay. Listen,

126
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:26,973
it may in fact have
been a giant tarantula.

127
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:29,948
I've seen tarantulas as
big as a foot across.

128
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,790
Who's this guy?
He happens to be an exterminator.

129
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:34,501
Spiders happen to
be my specialty.

130
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,202
I know what spiders are thinking.
I get into a spider's head.

131
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:43,051
I think like a spider.
I move like a spider, all eight legs.

132
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,707
I become a spider
to catch a spider.

133
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:57,129
Okay, all right.
Do you want to go down with

134
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:58,898
Carl and maybe take
care of this thing?

135
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,446
I'd really appreciate it. As you can see,
I've got my hands full here.

136
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,110
Right now?
Yeah.

137
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:02,908
I'd really appreciate it.

138
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,740
I would love to do that for you.
Carl, we could do that.

139
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,751
Sure.
I love to work pro Bono.

140
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,484
Okay, that's great. I appreciate that.
No problem at all.

141
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:10,879
No problem. I just have a quick
thing to discuss. See this?

142
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,987
This is my bill for the hospital.
I haven't settled this yet,

143
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:17,937
so I'll take care of this for you
if you take care of this for me.

144
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:22,962
Sort of quid pro quo pro Bono.
Sounds fair to me, boss.

145
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,010
Thank you, Jose.

146
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,672
Yes, fine.
That's great.

147
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,604
Consider your visit on the house.
Thank you.

148
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,916
Great. Okay, Carl, will
you take this gentleman

149
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,253
downstairs, and let's get
rid of this bug, okay?

150
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:37,186
Okay, boss, but I don't feel so good.
Let me see the bite.

151
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:42,080
Okay, I'm going to
get you to the E.R.

152
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,014
It's going to be an
intern's nightmare.

153
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:50,715
José.
Yeah.

154
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,705
Will you please take our bug-
killing friend to the morgue?

155
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:53,341
Oh, sure.

156
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:55,313
Anything he needs, just
take care of it, okay?

157
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,050
You got it, boss.

158
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,782
I'm going to have to grab a couple
things from my... from my truck.

159
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:00,511
That's okay.

160
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:02,983
You're not a real police officer, are you?
Security guard.

161
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,320
Okay. All right, my truck's out back.
Okay. Oh, and they hand me a gun.

162
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, put it away.

163
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,940
I will. I have handcuffs, too.
Good. Okay.

164
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,197
I got some mace.
Sure.

165
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,284
So you get in the mind
of the spider, really?

166
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,545
I do.
That's crazy.

167
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:16,051
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's a little nuts.

168
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:28,316
Sir, we have a location.
E.T.A. 5 minutes.

169
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,145
It's over here.

170
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,215
Uh-oh, the lights
don't work so good.

171
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:45,202
It's cold in here.
No, spiders don't like it cold.

172
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:48,292
They like it warm.
Dark and warm.

173
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,967
Well, that's good.

174
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,157
Hey, Jorge.
Uh-huh.

175
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:00,122
Can you get my flash light?
It's in the side of my bag.

176
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,182
Sure.

177
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,406
My name's Jose. Okay?
Okay.

178
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,352
Oh, my God.
What?

179
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,504
Oh, God.
What?

180
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:14,648
This is so gross.

181
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:15,923
Oh, yeah? What?
Look at this.

182
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,399
No, describe it.
I'm not going to look.

183
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,472
Oh, uh.
What?

184
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:23,893
The spider must've... oh,
he must've got inside

185
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,920
this guy's body and dug
his way out through

186
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,141
his lungs or his stomach or something.
What?

187
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,744
Oh, my God.
Oh, poor guy.

188
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:34,193
How big did Carl say this thing was?
What did he say exactly?

189
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,674
Exactly?
Yeah.

190
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,681
Let me see. Uh, "He bit me, boss.
He bit me."

191
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:40,674
And then Lisa said
"It was a doggie."

192
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:45,039
He said, "No." And then I said, "Maybe
it was a black cat." He said, "No."

193
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,933
"Then it's a monkey."
He said, "No." He said

194
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:50,317
it was like a spider but
bigger than a spide-

195
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,639
Maybe it was a spider monkey.

196
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,172
A spider monkey?
A spider monkey.

197
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:20,124
Ooh, what is all this? We already called.
It was a false alarm.

198
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,365
No, it wasn't.

199
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,632
Is that, like, Raid?

200
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:33,438
Raid? No. Raid is for housewives.

201
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,267
This is a very potent brew,

202
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:39,128
my own concoction
of sticky acid.

203
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:42,889
A few drops on a termite
hive, and it's history.

204
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:45,057
And it's eco friendly.
Oh, that's nice.

205
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:51,320
Okay, if you were a spider,
where would you be?

206
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,911
Oh, damn it.
What?

207
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,803
Yes, I know, but I thought
it was, you know, spider...

208
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,212
you were scared, too.
Shut up.

209
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:22,510
Where's this vent go to?

210
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:26,137
Uh, through the building,
from the roof, all

211
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:28,054
the way down to the
basement machine room.

212
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:29,940
The machine room?
Yeah.

213
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:31,242
Where it's warm.
Ah.

214
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:35,502
Okay, Jose, get up there.
I'm not going to get up there.

215
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:36,834
Come on, man. You're a little guy.

216
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,341
Get in the vent.
I'm not going in there.

217
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:39,827
I'm kidding.
Get my bag for me.

218
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:45,112
It's not funny, man. But, listen, are
you really going to go up there?

219
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,914
Yeah, that's what I do.

220
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:52,939
This is how I roll, man.
There is no bug that can outdo the Ex.

221
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,965
And besides, the bug
that we're dealing with?

222
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,607
Is a big bug.
Ah.

223
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,890
In my line of work, it's the little
bugs you've got to be scared of.

224
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:58,902
you've got to be scared of.

225
00:16:58,925 --> 00:16:59,834
Oh, the little ones.
Yeah.

226
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,958
Oh, I hate little bugs. You know?
I hate

227
00:17:02,993 --> 00:17:06,005
gnats, mosquitoes,
cucarachas of course.

228
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,955
I don't even like lady bugs.
You know, everybody likes lady bugs.

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:13,023
I hate roly pollies, too. I
can't stand them. Chiggers.

231
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:15,927
Chiggers are, like, really bad
because they get under the skin.

232
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,505
Okay. Sorry, the one we're
looking for has a mean bite.

233
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:22,716
You've got a lot of
elderly, sick people, kids.

234
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,461
Let's do this for the kids.
Let's do it for the kids.

235
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,480
All right.

236
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:31,077
I'll be on channel two.
I'm going to need you

237
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,475
to talk me through the
entire vent, okay?

238
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:33,550
All the way through the building.

239
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,237
Wanna make sure this thing doesn't double
back and come back through this way.

240
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,379
Uh, wait a minute. I don't
have the sticky acid.

241
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:41,130
Yeah, but you've got the gun,
you've got the handcuffs, the mace.

242
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,539
Trust me, this thing is more
scared of you than you are of it.

243
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,381
Huh, I don't think so.

244
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:50,815
Uh, sir, there are no cell phones in the
hospital. There's a sign right there.

245
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:57,076
Set up a perimeter around the hospital.
Lieutenant, lock it down.

246
00:17:57,537 --> 00:18:01,347
Uh, that is a negative, my friend.
Repeat, not happening. We have patients-

247
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:02,747
Your hospital is now
under my command.

248
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:08,270
I'm sorry. I'm Gordon Harris, director
of the hospital. Who are you?

249
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:13,230
I am Major Braxton C. Tanner, Special
Forces, United States Army.

250
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,074
We have reason to suspect
you've inadvertently

251
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,382
received a very
dangerous contagion.

252
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:21,357
There's a body that was mistakenly
sent here to this hospital.

253
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:23,320
We'd like to see that body.
A contagion?

254
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,214
Now, where's the morgue?

255
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:28,444
Breaker, breaker, this is the Ex
calling El Dorado. Come in, Jose.

256
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:32,264
Uh, hi, yes, I'm here.
El Dorado, did you say?

257
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,445
Yeah, El Dorado. I'm
coming up to a junction,

258
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:38,444
east and west.
Which way to the basement?

259
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,616
Uh, what's a junction?

260
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,361
It's ... like when two roads come are...
you know, come together in a T,

261
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:51,351
and you don't... Do I go left
or right to go to the basement?

262
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:52,428
Go left.

263
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,625
What?
Yes.

264
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,467
Hello.
Don't yell at me. Go left.

265
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:58,835
Left, right?

266
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:02,284
<i>Yes, go left, izquierda.</i>
Am I scared of what?

267
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:07,019
Go left.
<i>Okay, I'm going left.</i>

268
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,007
Jose, I'm not alone
in here, buddy.

269
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:04,773
Oh, my God.

270
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:24,211
Jose. Jose, you're not
going to believe this.

271
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,108
It looks like our friend has
already had a little snack.

272
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:34,249
This is unbelievable and so beautiful.
The structure's incredible, the strength.

273
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,862
I can't... I've never
seen anything like it.

274
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,729
Oh, it's so sticky.

275
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:51,835
It's so sticky.

276
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:57,985
Oh, good God.

277
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,663
Oh, that's not good.
That's not good.

278
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,781
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

279
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,558
Come on.

280
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,679
Oh, that was interesting.
Oh, man.

281
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,861
So this is where the
body would've come in.

282
00:23:58,148 --> 00:24:00,113
Our morgue attendant
Carl's fallen ill, so he-

283
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:00,689
Fallen ill?

284
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:13,884
It is here.

285
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:17,959
Move to full lock up, people.
All units gear up.

286
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:23,470
So you're saying that the military can
just come in and shut a hospital down?

287
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,848
That's not legal. You can't do that.
The hell I can't. You are under military

288
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,959
jurisdiction on a matter
of national security.

289
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:33,008
Your full cooperation and discretion
would be very much appreciated.

290
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:34,748
Do we have an understanding?
Yep.

291
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:35,391
Good.

292
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,157
Excuse me, Director Harris?

293
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:38,520
Uh, not now, Lisa.
Can we talk for a second?

294
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,514
Not now.

295
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,539
Something's happened.
It's one of the patients.

296
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:43,301
And?

297
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:45,863
Well, he's...
Dead?

298
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:49,280
Let's take a look.

299
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:14,146
Ah, okay.
I'm onto you, buddy.

300
00:25:18,086 --> 00:25:19,802
It's already hunting.

301
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:27,651
Granted the patient's immobility
indicates an advantageous access,

302
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:31,209
like a buzzard selecting
wounded prey.

303
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:35,835
It will get the hang of the kill quickly.
How long has it been?

304
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:41,753
Blood coagulation fresh. Ten, maybe
twelve minutes. It is close.

305
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:44,429
How big do you think
it is now, Doctor?

306
00:25:44,697 --> 00:25:49,180
It has quadrupled in size.
Qua... in 24 hours?

307
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,535
It will continue to grow exponentially.
Four

308
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:56,796
hours from now it
will quadruple again.

309
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:17,241
Where are you, friend?

310
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:27,922
Where are you, buddy? Come on, buddy.
The Ex has

311
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:34,422
..a treat for you. I got a...
a treat for you.

312
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:52,272
U.S. to Mexico. U.S.
to Mexico. Jose, it's Alex.

313
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:56,507
Copy that.
I think I found our spider.

314
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm down in the basement, buddy.
Down in the basement.

315
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:05,864
Okay.

316
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:10,969
Where are-

317
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:28,751
There you are, little buddy.
Wow, you're not such a little guy, are you.

318
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,510
All right, I've got
something for you.

319
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:43,527
I got something for you. Nice and shiny.
You're going to like this. Ready?

320
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,856
That's my quarter.
Give me back my quarter!

321
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,588
Oh, no you don't.
Not this time.

322
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,632
You gonna run from me?

323
00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:16,934
Ah, come on, buddy.

324
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,366
Get down!

325
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:34,896
What, are you trying to kill me?

326
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,617
Hey, they said I could be here.
What are you-

327
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:40,621
Hi.

328
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,327
Was that the only one?

329
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:49,100
The only what? Spider?
Uh, yeah, I hope so.

330
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,169
What?

331
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,511
Oh, great, it's gone.

332
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,092
Yeah, nice job, moron.

333
00:29:07,427 --> 00:29:09,066
Made visual contact.
Moron?

334
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:11,146
Target it now in the sewer system.

335
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:12,301
Prepare to move out.
Moron?

336
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,927
I'm bringing an eye witness
in for questioning.

337
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:17,695
Hey, I had this thing bagged until
you started shooting at me.

338
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,096
No.
Shooting at me.

339
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:22,126
Okay, you've got no idea
what you're dealing with.

340
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,392
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.

341
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:27,612
I'm a professional.

342
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:31,402
Oh, I see. I see. Of course you are.
And, hey, nice uniform.

343
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:32,467
Thank you very much.
Now, move out.

344
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,048
That was sarcastic.
Move out.

345
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,090
Are you feeling something?
'Cause-

346
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:36,860
Head out.

347
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:42,345
Stuck.

348
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:21,496
Did you ever see the arachnid?

349
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,082
I don't know what that is.
Did you say Iraq?

350
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:25,057
Arachnid.
I like your pipe.

351
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,097
Major, here he is, a local exterminator.
Uh, Alex.

352
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:34,638
Alex Mathis, actually.
It's pest eradication specialist.

353
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:39,318
All kinds of pests, rodents, reptiles. All
I want from you, Mr. Mathis, is details.

354
00:31:39,353 --> 00:31:40,660
Tell me what you saw down there.

355
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,133
Hey, there he is.
Hey, how you doing?

356
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,130
What's up, Jose?
In concise sentences, please.

357
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,058
Okay, can I sit down?
It's been one hell of a morning.

358
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:53,123
Yeah, we're going to sit down, okay?
You want details? This thing's huge.

359
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:56,054
This is the biggest spider
that I've ever seen,

360
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,600
maybe the biggest
spider on record,

361
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,335
and from the look of the bite
that it gave that mortician,

362
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,189
I'd say this thing is highly
poisonous, aggressive, fast, smart.

363
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,589
It's strong, really strong. It moved
that sewer grate out of the way.

364
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:12,223
That's got to be about 25 pounds.
This is a big-ass spider.

365
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:15,704
Exoskeleton's hardened then.
It's already entered Stage Two.

366
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:17,000
All right, Major, we've got to
get it

367
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,245
before it hits Stage Three
and increases in size again.

368
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,450
Increases in size?
What are you talking about?

369
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,170
What does that mean?
Who are you guys?

370
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,233
Why are you hunting a spider?

371
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:26,147
We appreciate your time, Mr. Mathis.
Lieutenant,

372
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,637
will you escort these two
gentlemen off the premises?

373
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:28,583
No, no, no, no, no,
don't brush me off...

374
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,619
Hey, it's not going to stay in
the service tunnel very long.

375
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,950
You know that, right? It's gonna look
for a place that's warm and dry

376
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,675
not cold and wet and
it's gonna want to hunt.

377
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:37,100
You're way out of
your league, son.

378
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:37,770
All right.

379
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:43,517
Well, I've had worse
job interviews.

380
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:45,749
I think your boss really likes me.
I thought it went well.

381
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:48,644
He doesn't like games.
He doesn't like games?

382
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,560
Then what's with the secrecy?
Just tell us what's going on?

383
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:53,631
Look, we made a mistake,
and now we're taking

384
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,850
care of it, and that's
all you need to know.

385
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,935
No, no, no, no, no, what
does that mean, "We

386
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,300
made a mistake"? Like
"We" made this mistake?

387
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,432
I've got to get back,
so why don't you two

388
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:05,501
take off before Braxton
has you arrested.

389
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:08,351
Wow. Uh, Lieutenant.
Yes?

390
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,734
Just in case the military or you

391
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:15,849
should need any assistance at all...
...this is my card.

392
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,798
Mister...
Alex.

393
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:17,971
Alex.
Alex...

394
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:18,444
Mathis.

395
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:21,047
On Twitter it's
bad-ass bug killer.

396
00:33:21,071 --> 00:33:24,244
If you think of anything else
important, you can give me a call.

397
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,409
Oh, so look at that.
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

398
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:29,707
I will definitely be
giving you a call.

399
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:31,552
All right. All right.
I appreciate it, and I could friend you.

400
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:36,768
All right, don't let this get out.
And try to stay out of trouble.

401
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,460
Wow.

402
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:43,056
Hm, what a nice lady.
I think she likes you.

403
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,087
Can't believe I let
this one get away.

404
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:45,594
She's right there.
I call her.

405
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:48,335
No, no, no, no, no,
Jose, the spider?

406
00:33:48,366 --> 00:33:50,083
Oh, yeah. Hey, but
where are you going?

407
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:52,843
What do you mean, where am I going?
This is it, buddy.

408
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:53,704
What?

409
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:57,770
The end of our adventure. It's been fun.
Hey, you cannot give up now, Alex.

410
00:33:58,017 --> 00:34:02,199
You heard her.
She's got the Army working with her.

411
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,917
What are we supposed to do?

412
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:05,857
But isn't this, like, the
biggest spider ever?

413
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:09,688
Yes, this is, without question,
the biggest spider on record.

414
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:12,950
Yes, so it would be good business,
right, for you to catch it or kill it.

415
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:16,165
Yes, if I could catch it
or kill it, which I can't.

416
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:18,098
Okay, but it could make
you famous, right?

417
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:20,759
Yes, this would get a lot of press.
What are you getting at?

418
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:23,603
Look, you could be
super- exterminator.

419
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:29,125
And Jose. And my boss told me to
help you, so I'm going to help you,

420
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:33,823
and you know, like, how?
Like Robin helps the Batman.

421
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:36,389
Like Tonto helps the Lone Ranger.

422
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:39,071
Like Kato helps the Green Hornet.
Yeah.

423
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:41,216
Like Sancho Panza helps Don Quixote.
Yes.

424
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,946
Like John Oates helps
Daryl Hall, baby.

425
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:47,360
Yes, we are going to do this. We're
going to show her that spiders don't fly.

426
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:48,005
Yes.

427
00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:49,526
And spiders don't swim.
Yes.

428
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:52,203
Some do, but that's not the point.
You and I are

429
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:54,147
going to find this spider
before they do. Come on.

430
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:59,262
Let's do it.
Wicked.

431
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:17,709
The five-mile radius should be enough.
Let's get some eyes out there.

432
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:22,122
Any sign?
Containment is our priority right now.

433
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:25,830
We have to neutralize the target
before somebody out there sees it.

434
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:28,047
The mere sight of this thing
will 'cause mass panic.

435
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,675
Sir, we have a problem.

436
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,657
<i>Dodd, who shot the amateur video</i>
claims it was footage of a giant spider

437
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:36,854
measuring over six feet in length.

438
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:39,581
We now go live to the scene
of this strange sighting.

439
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:44,102
<i>I saw a big-ass spider.
I came around the corner.</i>

440
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:46,739
<i>First thing I had to do
was get my phone out.</i>

441
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:47,951
<i>Ain't nobody gonna believe this...</i>

442
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,393
<i>I seen this spider was
coming at me, man.</i>

443
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:53,800
<i>It had multip...
like, what, eight, six legs?</i>

444
00:35:53,824 --> 00:35:56,648
<i>Yeah, about that.
It had multiple legs, dope.</i>

445
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,693
<i>It had multiple eyes.
It was multicultured.</i>

446
00:35:59,043 --> 00:36:00,261
<i>The fool's on crack!</i>

447
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,664
<i>If I see the spider again,
I'm gonna whoop his ass.</i>

448
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:07,988
<i>Are we ready to the spider?
Yeah!</i>

449
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,295
<i>You better hide your
kids, you better hide</i>

450
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,910
<i>your wife 'cause there's a big-ass...</i>

451
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,680
<i>bigger than a spi... there's
a mega-spider on the loose.</i>

452
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:18,345
Find that building and the
connecting service tunnel.

453
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:18,917
Yes.

454
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,506
It is moving into Stage Three.

455
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,994
Thank you, Doctor. Karly.
I'm on it.

456
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,871
We're going to need a miracle.

457
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,911
Hey, I like that song, Alex.

458
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:47,653
I like that music, too, my
friend, but we've got to focus.

459
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:52,748
You're right. Focus. Okay, so
what is the biggest spider ever?

460
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,339
Biggest spider ever has to
be the Goliath birdeater.

461
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:01,325
Yeah, unbelievable. This thing's got a
six-inch abdomen, three-inch fangs,

462
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,626
13 inches across. But I gotta tell
you, what we're following now...

463
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,109
Yeah.
This thing, what I saw...

464
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,368
Yes.
Much bigger.

465
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:07,655
Oh, come on.
I'm not kidding.

466
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:10,084
13 1/2 inches?
Much bigger.

467
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:12,441
14 inches. 14 1/2 inches.

468
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:13,806
Much bigger.
15 inches.

469
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:16,369
I'll meet you on the other side.
15 1/2... 16 inches?

470
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:17,982
20 inches.
20 inches?

471
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,245
What I saw was 20
inches long and black.

472
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,478
Sounds fun.

473
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,487
Sir, there's a phone
call for you.

474
00:37:34,091 --> 00:37:37,710
This is Major Tanner.
Yeah, it's Officer Edwards with the LAPD.

475
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:40,161
Something down here you're
probably going to want to see.

476
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,190
What is your location?
So what is this thing?

477
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,160
It's probably some
cross breed of spider.

478
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:50,544
I don't know. It's just, like,
a gigantic black widow.

479
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,788
Okay, so where would
a black widow go?

480
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:57,681
Well, black widows are night feeders,
so it's going to be looking for easy

481
00:37:57,682 --> 00:38:00,584
access outside the sewer
tunnels, some food supply, not a

482
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:04,176
lot of traffic, calm area, possibly-
What?

483
00:38:04,507 --> 00:38:08,161
<i>Un río. The river.</i>
Yes, yes, the L.A. River.

484
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:09,739
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

485
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,680
There. There's something.

486
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,563
Oh, sweet mother of God.

487
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:14,061
It built this under one hour.

488
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:23,443
<i>Looks like it housed maybe
20 or 30 people at night.</i>

489
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:24,926
Do you see any survivors?

490
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:32,219
<i>No. No one left. Except
for maybe some leftovers.</i>

491
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,855
A little more to
the right, please.

492
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:51,422
It has molted.

493
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,324
Center. Center Command,
this is Major Tanner.

494
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:57,898
We are at Stage Three. I repeat.
We are at Stage Three.

495
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,581
This town has no
idea what's coming.

496
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,283
Ah, it looks like they beat us to the punch.
Yeah, but do you think they killed it?

497
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:19,655
I don't know.
I'm about to find out.

498
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,389
Hello?

499
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:29,604
Hey, it's Alex. I was just wondering,
um, so you got your spider, huh?

500
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:31,755
What?
Where are you?

501
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:32,638
Where are we?

502
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:36,106
We're right across the
river from you...

503
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:38,727
...and your soldiers. Hey.

504
00:40:38,732 --> 00:40:40,641
Listen, we just missed it.
Anything else?

505
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,482
Anything else. Um-

506
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,862
Ask her out, man.
What?

507
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,251
Ask her out, Alex.
No.

508
00:40:45,314 --> 00:40:46,593
Don't be scared.
I'm not scared.

509
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:49,462
Listen. No offense, but I don't have time
for this, all right? Good-bye, Alex.

510
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:50,154
I was wondering if maybe-

511
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,935
What?
Hello.

512
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,269
What happened?

513
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:56,682
Uh, spider's still on the loose.
Oh, it is?

514
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:57,123
Yes.

515
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,354
Okay, so. Where do you think
it would go from here?

516
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:00,733
Well, it's going to be
looking for food and fast.

517
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,235
Thought you said
it hunts at night.

518
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,009
Yeah, but something this size is
going to hunt when it's hungry,

519
00:41:05,116 --> 00:41:06,763
and there's nothing around
but industrial space.

520
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,824
It could hide in the hills.

521
00:41:09,163 --> 00:41:12,063
Yes, it could... Yes, it's going
to be looking for higher ground.

522
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:15,565
Very good guess, Señor Watson.
It's going to need tree cover.

523
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:18,697
<i>You know, my cousin had a
quinceañera at Elysian Park.</i>

524
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,406
It's Sunday. There's lots of
people there cooking out.

525
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:23,285
That's where I would be with my
family if I had the day off-

526
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:25,339
Hey, you know what? Elysian Park.
Let's try Elysian Park.

527
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:27,453
Are you serious?
I just said Elysian Park, Alex.

528
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,878
<i>Come on.
Vámonos!</i>

529
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:38,594
The drone has a lock
on our target, sir.

530
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:42,599
Good God.

531
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:44,646
Location?
Elysian Park

532
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:46,245
Get units there now.

533
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:52,307
Oh, stop sign, Alex.

534
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:53,966
No, there's no slowing down.
We've got to get to the park.

535
00:42:54,002 --> 00:42:54,805
Oh, there goes the stop sign.

536
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:57,146
We have got to get to the park
and evacuate these people.

537
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:03,418
Oh, boy.

538
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:06,554
Oh, man. We gonna get it now.
I told you to drive slow.

539
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:07,747
I'll do the talking, okay?

540
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,531
Yeah, hope so.
You're the white guy.

541
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:00,927
Alex, wait-
Oh, man.

542
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,282
Listen, I'm a
professional Driver.

543
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:05,292
I'm going to need you to
step back into your vehicle.

544
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:06,737
No, no, no, but there's
something huge in the park,

545
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,172
and I'm just
saying we have a major-

546
00:44:08,176 --> 00:44:09,590
Alex, listen to him. Okay?
Just listen to him-

547
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,025
Excuse me, sir, I need you
to step back inside the car.

548
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:12,620
Put your hands on
the dash board.

549
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:13,782
Okay, good luck.
Good luck, Alex.

550
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:17,161
Back inside the car.
I understand what this is all about.

551
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:18,805
What's going on in the park today?
You got a picnic?

552
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:21,655
All right, maybe I should just
donate to the officer's fund. Huh?

553
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:22,951
Is that right?

554
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:23,945
Huh? Is that what
it's going to take?

555
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:26,221
Is that... Is that what this is?
That's exactly what that is.

556
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:28,861
A donation to the officer's fund.
Yes, siree. Can I go now?

557
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:33,060
This is a 12... $12 donation.
Seriously, man?

558
00:44:33,085 --> 00:44:33,833
Yeah, this is all I got.

559
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,851
Twelve dollars?
Sir, I'd like for you to turn around.

560
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:38,296
Turn around?
I'm a professional.

561
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,031
Put your... Turn around, put
your hands on the car, please.

562
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,280
There are hundreds if not
thousands of people in the park..

563
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:43,431
Their lives depend on us getting there.

564
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:44,972
<i>Is that right?
Yes, absolutely.</i>

565
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,525
All units, all units, please
report to Elysian Park.

566
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:48,481
Yeah.
There's a disturbance in progress.

567
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,030
Okay.
Huh? Huh?

568
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:50,878
Elysian... ¿Elysian Park?

569
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:53,198
Oh, look at that.
Okay, go! Go!

570
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:56,348
Don't... Don't be waving me off.
You better get out of here, all right?

571
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:57,843
This works.
This works.

572
00:44:58,006 --> 00:44:59,496
Can I have my bribe back?

573
00:46:58,234 --> 00:46:59,967
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm going to ram it.

574
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:02,017
Oh. What?
Yes.

575
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:03,598
No, you're joking.
Yes!

576
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:21,348
Go! Go! Go!
I'm going as fast as I can.

577
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,719
Are you okay? Are you okay?
No.

578
00:47:39,754 --> 00:47:40,769
Are you okay?
No.

579
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,502
You're not okay?
No, I'm not okay.

580
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,071
Okay.

581
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:47,884
Who in the hell is that idiot?
That's Alex Mathis.

582
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:51,802
The exterminator?
Yes, sir.

583
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:53,429
He's going to get
himself killed.

584
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:58,872
What?

585
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:03,019
Okay, listen. Enough of this.
Your Spanglish is pressuring me. All right?

586
00:48:03,034 --> 00:48:03,815
I can't go on.

587
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:06,211
Hello, Western Exterminator.
We care.

588
00:48:06,235 --> 00:48:07,809
Alex, this is Lieutenant Brandt.

589
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,310
Hey, Karly, how are you?
We're onto your spider. We're in Elysian Park.

590
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:14,806
Listen, we're here, Alex. Get clear.
We're going to handle this.

591
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,001
Uh, no, no, we're going to take
care of the spider, and then

592
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:19,403
I am going to take
you out to dinner.

593
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:22,971
Alex, I'm not joking.
You're heading right into a crossfire.

594
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:24,621
I'm sorry.
We're heading into a what?

595
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:25,210
A crossfire.

596
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:26,727
A crossfire.
What's a...

597
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:27,978
A crossfire?
What's a...

598
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:40,542
All right, on my command.
Open fire!

599
00:49:01,557 --> 00:49:02,385
My truck!

600
00:49:38,052 --> 00:49:39,425
You son of a bitch!
Alex, don't!

601
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:51,013
Are you insane?
What were you thinking?

602
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:53,621
Hey, did you miss me? You
could've been killed.

603
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:56,247
Well, we just thought we'd
bring the spider to you.

604
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:58,831
I don't have time to deal with this
clown. Get him out of my sight.

605
00:49:59,368 --> 00:50:00,343
Yes, sir.
You're welcome.

606
00:50:00,394 --> 00:50:01,851
Keep him out of our way.
Lieutenant,

607
00:50:01,886 --> 00:50:03,894
regroup the men and form a perimeter.
Yes.

608
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:06,228
I want to kill that bastard
while it's still in the woods.

609
00:50:06,263 --> 00:50:07,246
Yes, Major.

610
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:08,020
And get some more men up here.

611
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,529
Hey, I lost my truck.
Uh, I lost my glasses.

612
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,942
You will need more firepower.

613
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:16,385
There's enough explosive in
here to take out a tank.

614
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,478
Thank you.

615
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:20,512
I lost my truck.
You're worried about your glasses?

616
00:50:20,578 --> 00:50:21,644
I'm... yeah, you're right.

617
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,189
Hey, Karly, what about me?
What about you?

618
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:43,861
Well, should I come with you?
Jose and I can be our own unit.

619
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:45,223
Yeah, I shot it a whole bunch.

620
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:47,895
All right, listen, guys. Seriously
I've really appreciated everything

621
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,426
you've done, but we've
got it from here. Okay?

622
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:50,856
Wait, Karly.

623
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,744
You guys, listen.
You guys did a great job.

624
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:55,330
Thank you.
Karly, you need my help.

625
00:50:55,629 --> 00:50:57,832
Alex, what I've got to
do now is move out.

626
00:50:58,224 --> 00:51:01,010
You and your men are about
to walk into a death trap.

627
00:51:01,045 --> 00:51:03,753
The wooded area's her terrain.
This is home turf advantage for her.

628
00:51:03,788 --> 00:51:06,908
They don't call her one of the greatest
predators on earth for nothing.

629
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:10,308
Trust me.
Karly, you need my help

630
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:12,373
Alex, this is my job.

631
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,364
How come women never listen to me?
What?

632
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,037
Stay sharp, boys.

633
00:51:56,003 --> 00:52:00,388
Now, if you come across
a hide or lair, your

634
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:04,586
first priority is to drop the thermite
pack and fall back immediately

635
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,108
All detonation will be
signaled from here.

636
00:52:29,578 --> 00:52:31,403
Look out. Look out!

637
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:43,796
Where's Balzda?
Where's Balzda?

638
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,093
We lost all of Alpha company.
Lon's camera's down, too, sir.

639
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,596
Target acquired.
Target acquired.

640
00:52:51,355 --> 00:52:52,253
Engage.

641
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:12,222
Sir, we lost Private Parker.

642
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:14,921
Send teams Delta,
Echo, Foxtrot now.

643
00:53:29,592 --> 00:53:33,387
Damn.
Guys, I'm stuck.

644
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:35,406
Yeah, well, I'm stuck
in this stuff, too.

645
00:53:40,464 --> 00:53:42,920
Okay, it's... Charlie One.
It's... Charlie One.

646
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:44,600
We need immediate backup now.

647
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,808
Lieutenant Brandt.
Yes, sir.

648
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:02,911
If it gets in your vicinity...

649
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:07,373
...and you have a chance to end
this, are you prepared to do so?

650
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:09,485
Yes, sir.

651
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,974
Shh-shh-shh.
Quiet. Quiet.

652
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,883
Hi.
What are you doing here?

653
00:54:30,744 --> 00:54:32,554
I'm saving your ass.
What do you think I'm doing here?

654
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:34,564
Be careful. Be careful.
I know. I know.

655
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:35,914
Oh, my God.

656
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,418
Come on, hurry, hurry. Get me out.
Get me out.

657
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:43,243
I am. I am.

658
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:47,890
If I just heat the knife, we should be
able to cut right through it. Hold still.

659
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,120
Here... Here we go.

660
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,009
Yes.

661
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:55,610
Okay, thank you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

662
00:54:58,021 --> 00:55:01,940
Okay, we've got to keep moving.
And don't stop moving.

663
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:02,580
Okay.

664
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:07,654
Okay... whoa, whoa, whoa, keep moving.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

665
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:10,387
Okay, I have a contingency plan.
Yeah, what's that?

666
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:13,490
You see this pack on my back?
Yeah

667
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:16,655
It's filled with explosives that'll
blow that thing a mile high.

668
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,276
That's not good! If you
blow that thing a mile high,

669
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:20,632
you're going to blow us a mile high.
I'm sorry, Alex.

670
00:55:20,668 --> 00:55:25,088
What? Are you kidding me? The girl of
my dreams wanna kill me on my day off?

671
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:26,740
This is great.
Please don't do it!

672
00:55:37,516 --> 00:55:38,304
Go! Go! Go! Go!

673
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:40,945
Come one. We gotta go.
Let's get out-

674
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:45,418
Come on. Come on!

675
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:49,411
Come on, Karly!
I'm coming.

676
00:55:56,264 --> 00:55:56,855
Karly!

677
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:02,603
No!

678
00:56:21,317 --> 00:56:21,950
Oh, my God.

679
00:56:23,056 --> 00:56:24,886
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry, Alex.

680
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:26,459
Sorry, Alex?
What do you mean, sorry Alex?

681
00:56:26,494 --> 00:56:27,775
What's the plan, guys?
We gotta rescue her.

682
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:28,762
You're kidding, Alex.

683
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:30,280
Kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.

684
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,636
She's as good as dead.
Let's move on.

685
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,611
No!
Wh-What are we all?

686
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:36,322
We're just numbers to you guys?
Is that it?

687
00:56:36,346 --> 00:56:39,427
Hey, Braxton, come on. What is this?
It's just collateral damage?

688
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:41,777
Lieutenant Brandt and I went
through hell and back to get her,

689
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:44,179
so don't tell me about
losing a friend.

690
00:56:48,122 --> 00:56:52,097
She was a good soldier, and her
death will not be in vain.

691
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:56,228
Now, we're running out of time.
It's still out there.

692
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:59,218
And about to run amok
into Stage Five.

693
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:02,425
St... Okay.
What-What's Stage Five?

694
00:57:06,554 --> 00:57:09,538
Doc, what happens in Stage Five?
Come on.

695
00:57:09,865 --> 00:57:11,987
This is not the first time you
guys have dealt with this.

696
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:16,097
What did you make that is
running around killing people?

697
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:19,227
We didn't make anything, at
least not intentionally.

698
00:57:19,255 --> 00:57:25,876
his arachnid is an aberration
from several unusual technologies.

699
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:28,064
Come on. In layman's terms,
what are we dealing with?

700
00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:33,708
Alien biology, not terrestrial.

701
00:57:34,263 --> 00:57:37,034
So you're saying the spider's an alien?
Yeah.

702
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,928
Not exactly, but yes.
DNA cross breeding

703
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:46,501
from microbial fossil
found in Martian soil.

704
00:57:46,845 --> 00:57:50,601
So you made a spider do it with an alien.
That's messed up.

705
00:57:51,184 --> 00:57:52,061
No, no, no.

706
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:53,634
That's messed up, guys.
This is your people, Alex.

707
00:57:53,658 --> 00:57:57,569
No, no, no, we did cross
breed two species.

708
00:57:58,362 --> 00:58:03,648
We isolated separate genes,
one of which, in particular,

709
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:10,381
produces a superior growth hormone.
It's promise is infinite.

710
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:14,772
Giant tomatoes to feed the
whole world and such.

711
00:58:14,796 --> 00:58:17,247
"Tomatoes" is the first word
I understood. You know?

712
00:58:17,344 --> 00:58:21,391
But something went wrong.
No kidding.

713
00:58:21,544 --> 00:58:23,959
I got a question for you.
Yes.

714
00:58:24,037 --> 00:58:26,314
So why do we got the giant spider?
I don't get it. You get it?

715
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,949
I don't get it.
What's with the spider, doc?

716
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,321
We don't get it.
You get it, Braxton?

717
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:35,980
It was an accident. One of the
fruit plants that were brought

718
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:39,523
in as a test subject had a spider's nest

719
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,930
hidden inside.
The arachnid biology...

720
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:45,929
...was immediately responsive
to our growth hormone.

721
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:49,433
Major and I monitored
four stages of growth.

722
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:55,311
Letting it proceed to Stage
Five was deemed unacceptable.

723
00:58:56,084 --> 00:58:59,321
What happens in Stage Five?

724
00:58:59,997 --> 00:59:02,943
What happens in Stage Five?

725
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,411
Reproduction.

726
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:11,742
Of course. Reproduction.
I should've guessed that.

727
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:14,373
Yes, of course reproduction.

728
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,525
It would have to be
reproduction, right?

729
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:19,266
Because this fairytale has got
spiders from Mars, right?

730
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,975
It's a nice little bedtime story
to tell us you're telling us.

731
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:23,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You got spiders humping each other.

732
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:30,259
Alex, even with our
high-tech equipment, you

733
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,492
managed to find it the
same time we did.

734
00:59:32,516 --> 00:59:33,123
Yes, I did.

735
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:34,766
No, wait. We did.
Okay?

736
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:36,610
Right.
Correct?

737
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:38,914
You seem to understand its nature.
Yes, I do.

738
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,931
So what's your best guess?

739
00:59:42,493 --> 00:59:45,790
Oh, so now you want our help, huh?
School them, Alex.

740
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:50,823
All right, my professional opinion
is that without question,

741
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:53,623
she's going to lay her eggs as far away

742
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:56,399
from a populated area as she can get.

743
00:59:56,978 --> 00:59:59,538
Humans she doesn't trust.
She never has.

744
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:03,134
So you're not going to find her
anywhere near a populated area.

745
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:05,570
What, like under a bridge
or a warehouse or s...

746
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:07,946
No, no, even more isolated.
Far away.

747
01:00:07,993 --> 01:00:09,140
Sir, sir.
Far away.

748
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:11,128
Sir, I think you
need to see this.

749
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:13,635
<i>We have a live feed of
Newscopter 8 that has spotted...</i>

750
01:00:13,774 --> 01:00:14,802
<i>...the creature headed
toward Little Tokyo.</i>

751
01:00:15,066 --> 01:00:17,861
<i>We advise you that if you are in
that area to evacuate immediately.</i>

752
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:18,784
<i>Or she might go downtown.</i>

753
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,396
Oh, l-look. It's right there.

754
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:23,646
Found her.
It's big.

755
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:44,396
<i>It appears to be climbing
up the top of City Hall.</i>

756
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:48,176
<i>The size of it is just unbelievable.
It also appears to be hostile.</i>

757
01:00:48,265 --> 01:00:52,102
<i>If you are in the
downtown area...</i>

758
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:28,001
All right, son, this is Tanner.

759
01:01:28,036 --> 01:01:30,424
Request status on
Operation Ground Swell.

760
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:31,670
Call in an air strike, Major.

761
01:01:31,764 --> 01:01:34,567
Wait. Air strike? What air strike?
Contingency.

762
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:37,435
You can't just drop a bomb here.
Oh, that's not good.

763
01:01:37,502 --> 01:01:40,394
No, you can't... you
can't bomb downtown L.A.

764
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:43,796
We're running a little low on options,
so I'm calling in a targeted air strike.

765
01:01:43,797 --> 01:01:45,664
You're risking the lives
of thousands of people.

766
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,931
Saving millions.

767
01:01:47,956 --> 01:01:50,106
Wait a minute.
There's got to be a better way.

768
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,395
Enough of this.
Remove this Western Terminator.

769
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:54,361
What?

770
01:01:54,453 --> 01:01:55,921
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see
you try it, pretty guy.

771
01:01:56,134 --> 01:01:58,141
Oh, Okay. You got it.
Okay, we're leaving.

772
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:12,644
Sir, we have a lock
on the building.

773
01:02:17,624 --> 01:02:18,543
Zooming in.

774
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:27,373
Is that Lieutenant Brandt?

775
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:35,530
I need a minute.
Copy that.

776
01:02:40,964 --> 01:02:41,917
I hope you have insurance.

777
01:02:42,965 --> 01:02:45,718
The company has insurance, yes.
Well, don't worry about it-

778
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:50,190
Alex, wait. It's Karly. She's still alive.
Don't mess with me.

779
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:52,684
That spider, she laid her eggs on
top of the Epic Bank Building.

780
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:55,097
There are a lot of people trapped up there.
Karly's one of them.

781
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:55,999
Okay, so what do we do?

782
01:02:56,232 --> 01:02:59,444
Well, you have about 24 minutes
before the jets arrive there.

783
01:03:00,058 --> 01:03:02,732
And what happens before
then is up to you.

784
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:08,196
I'll drive.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

785
01:03:13,432 --> 01:03:14,895
Okay, so what's the plan, Alex?

786
01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:20,214
The plan: Stop the spider,
save the city, kiss the girl.

787
01:03:20,238 --> 01:03:23,695
Oh, good.
Any idea how to do that?

788
01:03:24,354 --> 01:03:27,324
No.
That's what I thought.

789
01:03:40,513 --> 01:03:42,580
Our guns are doing nothing
against this thing.

790
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:48,184
Disengage. Disengage. Pull back,
but maintain visual contact.

791
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:51,834
See, it's a perfect target up there.
If we can take it out on the rooftop,

792
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:53,469
it'll keep civilian
casualties to a minimum.

793
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:57,214
As long as we take out that
building before the eggs hatch.

794
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:47,966
So can I ask you
something else, Alex?

795
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,161
Sure.
Go, Mexican Robin.

796
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:52,408
How are we going to
kill this big spider?

797
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:55,039
I'm trying to figure that one out.
I mean, we can't shoot it.

798
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,116
Why?

799
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:58,592
Why? Because it's huge. The exoskeleton
alone is stronger than anything

800
01:04:58,658 --> 01:05:01,257
we've got to penetrate it, and
it's resistant to flames.

801
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,739
It's resistant to
any kind of heat.

802
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:05,800
We have not even created a
fire suit strong enough to-

803
01:05:05,826 --> 01:05:06,772
<i>Fire, eh?
How about fuego?</i>

804
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,854
No, no, I just said
it's resistant to fire.

805
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:12,256
Yes, but the web catches on
fire, so can we use that?

806
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,337
Wait a minute.
What?

807
01:05:13,384 --> 01:05:15,430
Wait a minute. That's it. Jose!
What?

808
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:19,022
If we can ignite the spinneret,
we can blow it up from the inside out.

809
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:20,027
Really?
Yes!

810
01:05:20,256 --> 01:05:21,886
What's a spinneret?
Spinnerets.

811
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:22,937
Spinnerets.

812
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:23,764
Spin.

813
01:05:23,912 --> 01:05:26,216
Er... er ...ets.

814
01:05:26,475 --> 01:05:27,180
Spinnerets.

815
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,834
Where's the spinnerets?
In its ass.

816
01:05:29,645 --> 01:05:32,695
So we have to shoot the
spider in the butt.

817
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:33,283
In the butt.

818
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:34,881
How we going to do that?
That's right.

819
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:36,289
Uh, how we going to do that?

820
01:05:40,506 --> 01:05:43,520
With this.
Oh, baby.

821
01:05:43,544 --> 01:05:45,491
Right?
Wicked.

822
01:05:52,173 --> 01:05:54,305
Where's the air strike?
E.T.A. two minutes.

823
01:05:54,713 --> 01:05:56,232
Have them circle once more.

824
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:01,299
You are insane, Braxton.
You can't risk these

825
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:04,256
eggs hatching. Take
down that building now.

826
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:06,967
I'm done with you scientists.
You started this thing.

827
01:06:07,189 --> 01:06:09,453
Now, you let us finish it.
Remove this man.

828
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:12,977
Escort him out of my command center now.
I will see you in hell, Braxton.

829
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:25,196
Get me Alex on the phone.
Western. We live to kill.

830
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:27,252
Alex, you have 10 minutes
to get to the 60th floor.

831
01:06:27,452 --> 01:06:31,149
After that I have no choice.
We can't risk any of those eggs hatching.

832
01:06:31,173 --> 01:06:39,448
Ten minutes is all we're going to need.
Look out. Look out!

833
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:43,591
No, no.
Jose! Hey, Jose!

834
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:51,755
Okay, I've got to go save Karly.
I've got to go save those people.

835
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,533
I'm coming with you.
No, we may not get out of there in time.

836
01:07:56,795 --> 01:07:59,613
Then we better get moving.
Let's do it, Alex.

837
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,392
Air strike E.T.A.
five minutes away.

838
01:08:46,947 --> 01:08:49,252
E.T.A. three minutes.
God help us all.

839
01:09:08,557 --> 01:09:11,854
<i>We're gonna kill some spiders.
Gonna kill some spiders dead.</i>

840
01:09:12,438 --> 01:09:16,732
<i>We're gonna kills some spiders.
Gonna shoot those muthas in the head.</i>

841
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:26,310
And stop.

842
01:09:28,196 --> 01:09:32,912
That's pretty good. That was all right.
Let's do this. You ready?

843
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,159
I'm ready.
You nervous?

844
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,054
Yes.

845
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,347
It's good that you're nervous.
Let's do this.

846
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,770
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. This is what
I was afraid of. She's laid her eggs.

847
01:10:01,338 --> 01:10:02,565
<i>Holy huevos.</i>

848
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:05,962
Oh, look at this.
Oh, man.

849
01:10:06,106 --> 01:10:08,305
¡Alex!
Karly.

850
01:10:08,654 --> 01:10:09,480
¡Alex!

851
01:10:09,843 --> 01:10:11,425
She's alive.
You were right.

852
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,503
I'm going to go help her.
You help these people.

853
01:10:13,527 --> 01:10:14,030
Okay, I will.

854
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,550
There you go. Go towards
the exit on the left,

855
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:21,103
there's a lot of spiders
on the right. Okay

856
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,872
Alex!
Okay, I'm right here. Right here.

857
01:10:23,975 --> 01:10:27,111
Just promise me this is the last time that
I'm going to have to rescue you today.

858
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:30,709
I mean, seriously, two saves in one day.
Hurry.

859
01:10:38,112 --> 01:10:39,553
¡Alex! ¡Alex!
I got it.

860
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,136
Nice.
Oh, boy.

861
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:58,036
Here they come. Time to go!
Help me! Oh, my God, help me!

862
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,478
I need a hand. I need a hand!

863
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:04,274
Oh, my God, she's dead.

864
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:08,853
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Alex!

865
01:11:11,025 --> 01:11:14,964
Come on, Alex! Clear out!
Clear out!

866
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,271
Come on, Alex!

867
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,848
Thank you for calling Western.

868
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:30,193
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

869
01:11:37,683 --> 01:11:40,488
Nice shot.
Yeah, well, now we're even.

870
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:44,185
No, not quite.
What?

871
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,317
We're out of time.

872
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:51,717
Engage target. Engage target.

873
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,208
Yes!

874
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:14,965
Well, let's not
celebrate just yet.

875
01:12:23,148 --> 01:12:25,933
So how much you gonna charge
for killing the big spider?

876
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:29,264
I don't know, but I hope it
covers the cost of a new truck.

877
01:12:29,288 --> 01:12:31,378
Yes, he is.
The major wants to talk to you.

878
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:34,606
Major? Hope I'm not in trouble.
I hope not either.

879
01:12:35,779 --> 01:12:36,575
Yeah, Major?

880
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:41,229
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
You knocked it out of the park.

881
01:12:41,255 --> 01:12:43,281
Thank you for saving Karly.

882
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:45,849
Well, thank you very much, sir.
I told you I'm a professional.

883
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:48,983
That you are, son.
That you are.

884
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:52,178
Yeah, well, any time you have any
trouble, you know who to call,

885
01:12:52,317 --> 01:12:54,566
except it's not going to be cheap.
I've got a partner now.

886
01:12:56,117 --> 01:12:58,973
And there's a little business
about my, uh... my truck

887
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:01,588
I made some modifications to it.
Alex.

888
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,471
And I'm not sure that the insurance
at the company's going to cover it.

889
01:13:04,695 --> 01:13:05,191
Alex.

890
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:20,102
Major, I'm going to have to call you back.
Alex, can we get out of here?

891
01:13:21,603 --> 01:13:24,822
I'm sorry, Jose. I live to kill.

892
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,693
Okay.
I got your back, babe.

893
01:13:31,132 --> 01:13:32,118
Hey, Jose.
What?

894
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,109
You remember that conversation
we had in the... in the truck?

895
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:37,564
Which one?
The one about the spinneret.

896
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:39,310
We're going to shoot
it in the butt.

897
01:13:41,873 --> 01:13:43,750
Find me that bazooka!
You got it, Alex.

898
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:52,807
You want some of the Ex?

899
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:05,364
Alex! I'm coming.

900
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:15,411
Tíramela. Throw it to me.
Watch out, Alex! Wake up, Alex!

901
01:14:30,164 --> 01:14:31,290
Up yours.

902
01:14:58,678 --> 01:14:59,723
Yeah!

903
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:15,444
Nicely done.

904
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:20,116
I told you I'm a pro. I'm a pro.
Oh, look at you, you're gross.

905
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:21,029
Oh.

906
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,520
You've got web all over you.
You're one to talk.

907
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:26,322
Well, it looks like we're
stuck together for a while.

908
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,164
Is that a problem?
No, I don't have a problem with that.

909
01:15:30,242 --> 01:15:32,997
Well, what should you do with
the rest of your day off?

910
01:15:33,942 --> 01:15:34,964
I can think of a few things.

911
01:15:43,341 --> 01:15:44,581
All right, you guys.

912
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:49,218
Okay. Hey, come on, guys.
Get a room. Okay?

913
01:16:12,587 --> 01:16:15,192
Alex, I'm afraid we
have a little problem.

914
01:16:16,961 --> 01:16:19,043
What's the biggest
cockroach you ever saw?
