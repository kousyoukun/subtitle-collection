Where is it, out back?

00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,094
It's in the trap.

Is it ugly?

beautiful to me.

18
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:11,583
Kept us up all night long with its ruckus.
Didn't it, Mrs. Butterworth?
吵了整整一个晚上，是吗，Butterworth女士

19
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,386
Butterworthless when it comes
to catching critters.

20
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:20,792
At 5:06 A.M. I heard that trap shut,
and I called you ASAP. You're on my speed dial.
凌晨5点06分的时候那个陷阱在响，我马上呼叫了你

filthy vermin!
我诅咒你在地狱里腐烂，肮脏的寄生虫


23
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,498
Okay, I'm going to set it loose
in the park, okay?
好了，我准备在公园里放了他，好吗？

Break his neck first.

I am... I'm just... I'm so
embarrassed.
我，我只是，很困扰

29
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:45,117
The darned government was late with my Social
Security check again, so I brought you this.
没用的政府又没有签我的社保，所以我只能给你这个了

30
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,818
Oh.

31
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,953
A little sugar.

That is so sweet of you. Thank
you.

33
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:54,059
It's full of maraschino cherries,
and I left off the stems this time.
一杯满满的酒浸樱桃，这次有茎哦

34
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,029
Wow. Well, you can never count
on the government for anything,
知道了吧，永远别相信政府

35
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,965
but you can always count on me.

36
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,200
You are such a nice guy.

37
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,469

...a nice guy like you is still
single?
你这么优秀却还是单身呢？

40
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:15,113
I ask myself that same question every day.
I guess I just haven't met the right girl yet
这个问题我思考了很久，最后的答案就是还没遇见合适的女孩

41
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,415
When you do...

42
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,418
...she's going to be exhausted.
她一定累坏了

43
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,121
That was awkward. Okay, bye,
Mrs. J. I'll see-
太辶,拜,J女士,明天..

44
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,423

45
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,557

You have a spider on your arm.
你胳膊上有只蜘蛛

47
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,027
What? Oh, that's a tattoo.
什么?噢,那是纹身

48

A spider. No, no, no, no. A
spider is on your arm.
是蜘蛛,不,有只蜘蛛在你胳膊上

49
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,765

Oh, that's a brown recluse.
看呀,看着,是只褐皮花蛛

50
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:38,837
This is highly poisonous. As long as you don't provoke it,
so we just have to stay calm. Okay?

Let me help you. I can-
我来帮你，我可以-

54
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,276
No, no, stay calm means I don't
need your help.
不，保持冷静的话我就不需要你的帮助了

55
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,877
Okay, let me help you.
好了，让我来帮你

56
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,146
No, don't help me. You just stay
calm. No, Mrs. J. No-
不，别过来，你才保持冷静，不，J女士，不-

57
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:58,090
Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr.
Bender.
呼叫Bender医生，呼叫Bender医生

58
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,628
Was that a dead body?
那是个尸体吗？

59
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,597
Let's not focus on that,
Mister...
别盯着那个，小姐

60
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:09,401
Mathis. Was that one of your
patients, Nurse...
Mathis，那是你的病人吗，护士...

61
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:14,873
Lisa? I mean, I-I don't care.
I'm not saying that you were responsible for that,
Lisa?我是说,我不管,我不认为你要对这个负责

62
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,878
but being your next patient I
was just a little concerned.
但是作为你的下一个病人我有点小怕

63
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,849
You know, I would imagine, if I
looked up the word "nurse" in,
你知道,我会想象,如果我在护士日志,

64
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,985
let's say,
<i>Nurse Journal</i> or <i>Nurse Illustrated</i> or whatever it is,
或者护士说明书还是说明的查找护士的定义的话

65
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,054
that I would probably see a
picture of you.
可能那说的就是你

66
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,124
I mean, you are, like, the
perfect nurse.
我的意思是,你是,就像一个完美护士

67
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,425
Are you done?
说完了吗?

68
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,427
Okay.
恩

69
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,730
Okay, so it says here you have a small
puncture wound on your upper arm.
你的胳膊上面有一个伤口对吗

70
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,865
Correct.
是的

71
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,266
Can you remove your shirt,
please?
你能脱掉你的上衣吗

72
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,734
Sure.
当然了

73
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,703
It might be a bullet wound,
though, actually,
可能是枪伤,实际上

74
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,572
because I'm dodging bullets all
day long in what I do.
因为我整天都在躲子弹

75
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,574
And what is it that you do?
那你是做什么的?

76
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,710
Um, well, I actually-
好吧,我实际上-

77
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:59,712
Ow, ow. I, uh... Actually, I
shouldn't tell you. It's top secret. Ow.
噢,实际上我不能告诉你,最高机密

78
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,791
I'd say you're a comedian, but the shirt
gives you away. So do your work books
我不得不说你有喜剧天分,但你的衣服和你的工作薄出卖了你

79
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:11,463
Well, Mr. Mathis, it looks like one of your bugs bit you.
From the swelling, I'd say a spider.
Mathis先生,似乎是你的虫子咬了你,看伤口的肿胀,应该是蜘蛛

80
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,266
You know what? You'd be right.
It was a brown recluse.
被你发现了?是的,是只褐皮花蛛

81
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,270
All right,
let's just do 1/10 cc of Dexamethasone or cortisone,
好了,只需要给你注射0.1毫升的氟美松(抗炎药)或者可的松(肾上腺素)就行了

82
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,273
whatever you want. It's not my
first barbecue.
请便,反正不是我第一次被咬了

83
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:25,444
Okay, let me check that with the doctor.
I'll be giving you these shots myself.
好的,我去跟医生说一声,待会由我来给你注射

84
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,946
Then you'll be out fighting
bugs again in no time.
很快就会好的

85
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:34,986
Uh, nurse... Lisa... let's say for
a second that this is lethal,
呃,护士,Lisa，这是个致命伤

86
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,990
and, you know, I've only got
one meal left.
你知道的，我只剩下一餐饭了

87
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,227
What do you say, you, me,
breakfast? Huh?
你说什么,你，我，还是早餐？

88
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,528
No.
不

89
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,833
No.
不

90
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:04,115
It's too early for this crap and
need some help from the captain.
现在还太早了，我们需要总部的帮助

91
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,193
Jeez.
老天

92
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,844
$200 for gauze? Seriously, I
hope they accept fruitcake as
200美元的纱布？我希望他们接受用

93
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,447
payment because I don't know
what I'm going to do.
水果蛋糕来支付，因为我不知道怎么办了

94
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,355
Okay, everybody calm down. It's
just a fire alarm.
大家别激动，只是个火警

95
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:54,292
Walk out, please. Slowly. Let's go, sir.
Don't worry. Don't be scared.
走出来，慢慢的，别担心，别害怕

96
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,996
It's okay, don't run. Slowly,
slowly.
好了，别跑，慢一点，慢一点

97
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,998
Okay, it's fine, folks.
没事了，大家

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,300
It's fine. Everything's fine.
好了，所有人的没事

99
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,604
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please.
女士们先生们，请注意一下

100
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,139
Uh, this is a false alarm. It
is a false one, folks.
警报误响了，是个误会

101
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,041
There's no fire in the
building,
大楼里没有火宅

102
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,744
so if we could all just remain
calm, that would be great.
所以我们都冷静下来，这样很好

103
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,413
Jose, I need you to turn the
damn thing off.

Are you okay?

00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,721
You know what? I can help them out if you want.
You want me to help them out?
你知道吗？如果你需要我就能帮他们出来，你想我去帮他们出来吗

108
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,422
No, we're okay. We're fine.

Excuse me, Director?

112
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,894

00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,663
Carl has something very crazy to
say.
Carl要说一个很疯狂的事

114
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,698
There's something in the morgue.
陈尸所里有东西

115
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,368
It climbed right out of a body bag,
and it bit me. I swear to Christ.
它从尸体袋里爬出来咬了我一口，我发誓

116
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,403
Like the... Like the living dead,
Carl?
像，像活死人一样，Carl？

117
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,504
Jose, please.
别这样，Jose

118
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,640
Sorry, I like those movies.
我喜欢这些电影，不好意思

119
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,209
Carl, what the hell are you talking about?
Did you pull the fire alarm again?
Carl，你他妈在说什么？你又拉响警报了？

120
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:48,446
Hell, yes. Didn't you hear what I said?
There's some sort of animal that's down here.
对啊，你没听见我说什么吗？有什么生物在下面

121
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,683
Okay, but, Carl, you work at a hospital.
If something bites you,
好了，但是，Carl，你在医院里，如果有什么东西咬了你

122
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,785
there's doctors and nurses
everywhere.
这里到处都是医生和护士

123
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:57,589
There's no reason for you to pull a fire
alarm and alert the entire building.
你不能就这样拉响警报惊动整个医院

124
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,124
But it bit me, boss. It bit me.
它咬了我，老板，它咬了我

125
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,493
Maybe somebody brought in a dog.
可能谁带了狗进来

126
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,962
It's not a dog. Listen, I know how this sounds,
but you should have seen it.
不是狗，听着，我知道那种声音，你们应该见过

127
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:08,166
It's got these long black legs, like a spider,
but it's much too big to be a spider.
有长长的黑腿，像蜘蛛，但是比蜘蛛大多了

128
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,101
We've got to call somebody.
我们要找人了

129
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,504

00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,986
Uh, wait a minute. I don't have
the sticky acid.
等一下，我没有粘性酸

268
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,656
Yeah, but you've got the gun,
you've got the handcuffs, the mace.
但你有枪，你有手铐，还有锤子

269
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,859
Trust me,
this thing is more scared of you than you are of it.

Huh, I don't think so.
我不这样想

271

Uh, sir, there are no cell phones in the hospital.
There's a sign right there.
长官，医院里没有电话 -那里有个标志

272
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:51,436
Set up a perimeter around the hospital.
Lieutenant, lock it down.
封锁医院 -封锁他，中尉

273
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,640
Uh, that is a negative, my friend.
Repeat, not happening. We have patients-
拒绝，朋友，我重复，这不可能，我们有病人...

Your hospital is now under my
command.
你的医院现在由我接管

I'm sorry. I'm Gordon Harris,

不好意思,我是医院的总管Gordon Harris,你是谁?

Tanner, Special Forces, United States Army.
我是Braxton C少校,美国特种部队

received a very dangerous contagion.

Now, where's the morgue?
陈尸所在哪?

282
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,820
Breaker, breaker,
this is the Ex calling El Dorado. Come in, Jose.
Ex呼叫El Dorado，请回答，Jose

283
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,591

Dorado, did you say?
我在这，El Dorado,你说什么?

284
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:32,930
Yeah, El Dorado. I'm coming up to a junction,
east and west. Which way to the basement?
好的El Dorad，我在一个分支口，去地下室是向东还是向西，

Uh, what's a junction?
什么分支口？

Jose. Jose, you're not going to
believe this.
Jose，你不会相信这个的

301
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:22,773
It looks like our friend has
already had a little snack.
看来我们的朋友已经吃过点心了

302
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:28,879

Oh, that was interesting. Oh,
man.

would've come in.
这就是尸体进来的地方吗

All units gear up.

316
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,022
So you're saying that the military can
just come in and shut a hospital down?
你是说你的部队可以进医院然后随便开枪?

317
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,558
That's not legal. You can't do
that.
这不合法,你不能这样做

318

jurisdiction on a matter of national security.
谁说不行,你在国家安全的军事管辖权范围内

Excuse me, Director Harris?

Not now.

of the patients.

Ah, okay. I'm onto you, buddy.
我知道你，伙计

333
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,411
It's already hunting.
准备好狩猎了

334
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:22,386
Granted the patient's immobility
indicates an advantageous access,

335
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:29,293
like a buzzard selecting wounded prey.
It will get the hang of the kill quickly.

Qua... in 24 hours?
四..就一天内?

341
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:51,576
It will continue to grow exponentially.
Four hours from now it will quadruple again.
他会继续爆炸性增长,从现在开始四小时后又会长大四倍

342
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,169
Where are you, friend?

00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:44,927
The exterminator?
杀虫专家？

658
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,195
Yes, sir.
是的

659
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,031
He's going to get himself
killed.
他会害死他自己的

660
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:53,035
What?
什么？

661
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,107
Okay, listen. Enough of this.
Your Spanglish is pressuring me. All right?
好了，听着，够了 你混有西班牙文英语已经说服我了好吗

662
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,509
I can't go on.
我不能继续

663
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,911
Hello, Western Exterminator. We
care.
哈喽，杀虫先生

664
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,980
Alex, this is Lieutenant Brandt.
Alex，我是Brandt中尉

665
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,949
Hey, Karly, how are you?
We're onto your spider. We're in Elysian Park.
Karly你没事吧？我们去找你的蜘蛛了，在Elysian公园

666
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:09,986
Listen, we're here, Alex. Get clear.
We're going to handle this.
听着，我们到了，Alex，清醒点，我们要搞定它

667
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:13,155
Uh, no, no, we're going to take
care of the spider, and then I
不，我们要搞定蜘蛛，然后

668
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,324
am going to take you out to
dinner.
带你去吃晚饭

669
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:18,194
Alex, I'm not joking. You're
heading right into a crossfire.
Alex，不是开玩笑，你走进死交叉火力里了

670
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,962
I'm sorry. We're heading into a
what?
不好意思，我们走进什么了？

671
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:20,930
A crossfire.
交叉火力

672
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:21,898
A crossfire. What's a...
交叉火力，什么..

673
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,965
A crossfire? What's a...
交叉火力?

674
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,674
All right, on my command.
好了,听我命令

675
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,645
Open fire!
开火!

676
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,100
My truck!
我的车!

677
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,135
You son of a bitch!
你个狗娘养的的!

678
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,104
Alex, don't!
Alex，别！

679
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,147
Are you insane? What were you
thinking?
你疯了吗？想什么呢？

680
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,849
Hey, did you miss me?
嘿，想我了吗？

681
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,384
You could've been killed.
你会被杀了的

682
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:50,353
Well, we just thought we'd bring
the spider to you.
好吧，我们只是觉得我们把蜘蛛带给你了

683
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:53,723
I don't have time to deal with this clown.
Get him out of my sight.
我没时间跟这个白痴闹，把他带走

684
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:54,623
Yes, sir.
遵命

685
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,625
You're welcome.
不用谢

686
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,695
Keep him out of our way.
Lieutenant, regroup the men and form a perimeter.
把他带走，中尉，集合你的人拉条封锁线

687
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,430
Yes.
是

688
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:03,833
I want to kill that bastard
while it's still in the woods.
我想杀了那个混蛋但它一直在树林里

689
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:04,967
Yes, Major.
是的，长官

690
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:05,968
And get some more men up here.
带多些人来

691
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:06,969
Hey, I lost my truck.
嘿，我失去了我的卡车

692
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,171
Uh, I lost my glasses.
噢，我失去了我的眼睛

693
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,708
You will need more firepower.
There's enough explosive in here to take out a tank.
你会需要更多的火力

694
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,343
Thank you.
谢谢

695
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,345
I lost my truck. You're worried
about your glasses?
我没了卡车你还在想你的眼睛？

696
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,347
I'm... yeah, you're right.
我，好吧

697
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,764
Hey, Karly, what about me?
嘿，Karly，我呢？

698
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:36,565
What about you?
你？

699
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,801
Well, should I come with you?
Jose and I can be our own unit.
我该跟着你吗？Jose和我可是自己人

700
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,770
Yeah, I shot it a whole bunch.

701
00:50:40,772 --> 00:50:43,606
All right, listen, guys.
Seriously I've really appreciated everything

702
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,809
you've done, but we've got it
from here. Okay?

703
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,209
Wait, Karly.

704
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,778
You guys, listen. You guys did a
great job.

705
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,646
Thank you. Karly, you need my
help.

706
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,149
Alex, what I've got to do now is
move out.

707
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:56,485
You and your men are about to walk into a death trap.
The wooded area's her terrain.

708
00:50:56,487 --> 00:51:00,056
This is home turf advantage for her.
They don't call her one of the greatest

709
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:04,226
predators on earth for nothing.
Trust me. Karly, you need my help

710
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:08,631
Alex, this is my job.

711
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,567
How come women never listen to
me?

712
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,235
What?

713
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,400
Stay sharp, boys.

714
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:56,479
Now, if you come across a hide or lair,
your first priority is to drop the thermite pack

715
00:51:56,481 --> 00:52:03,486
and fall back immediately.
All detonation will be signaled from here.

716
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,875
Look out. Look out!

717
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,686
Where's Balzda? Where's Balzda?

718
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:41,390
We lost all of Alpha company.
Lon's camera's down, too, sir.

719
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:44,326
Target acquired. Target
acquired.

720
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,329
Engage.

721
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,815
Sir, we lost Private Parker.

722
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:10,619
Send teams Delta, Echo, Foxtrot
now.

723
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,903
Damn. Guys, I'm stuck.

724
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:31,907
Yeah, well, I'm stuck in this
stuff, too.

725
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:39,915
Okay, it's... Charlie One. It's... Charlie One.
We need immediate backup now.

726
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,129
Lieutenant Brandt.

727
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:55,264
Yes, sir.

728
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,032
If it gets in your vicinity...

729
00:53:57,034 --> 00:54:02,805
...and you have a chance to end
this, are you prepared to do so?

730
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:05,407
Yes, sir.

731
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,124
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Quiet.
Quiet

732
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:24,627
Hi. What are you doing here?

733
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:27,229
I'm saving your ass. What do you
think I'm doing here?

734
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,397
Be careful. Be careful.

735
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:29,465
I know. I know.

736
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,267
Oh, my God.

737
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,139
Come on, hurry, hurry. Get me
out. Get me out.

738
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,375
I am. I am

739
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:43,445
If I just heat the knife,
we should be able to cut right through it. Hold still.

740
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,848
Here... Here we go.

741
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:46,849
Yes.

742
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,651
Okay, thank you.

743
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:50,886
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

744
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:55,791
Okay, we've got to keep moving.
And don't stop moving.

745
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,026
Okay.

746
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,463
Okay... whoa, whoa, whoa, keep
moving. Smooth, smooth, smooth.

747
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,966
Okay, I have a contingency plan.

748
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,334
Yeah, what's that?

749
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,269
You see this pack on my back?
Yeah?

750
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:09,238
Yeah.

751
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,807
It's filled with explosives that'll
blow that thing a mile high.

752
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:16,045
That's not good! If you blow that thing a mile high,
you're going to blow us a mile high.

753
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:18,213
I'm sorry, Alex.

754
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:21,016
What? Are you kidding me?
The girl of my dreams wanna kill me on my day off?

755
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,085
This is great. Please don't do
it!

756
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,695
Go! Go! Go! Go!

757
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,330
Come one. We gotta go. Let's get
out-

758
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,436
Come on. Come on!

759
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,805
Come on, Karly!

760
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,606
I'm coming.

761
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,914
Karly!

762
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,419
No!

763
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,905
Oh, my God.

764
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,408
I'm sorry, guys. Sorry, Alex.

765
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:23,679
Sorry, Alex? What do you mean, sorry Alex?
What's the plan, guys? We gotta rescue her.

766
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,813
You're kidding, Alex.

767
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,315
Kidding? No, I'm not kidding.

768
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,250
She's as good as dead. Let's
move on.

769
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,719
No! Wh-What are we all?
We're just numbers to you guys? Is that it?

770
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:34,056
Hey, Braxton, come on. What is this?
It's just collateral damage?

771
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,992
Lieutenant Brandt and I went
through hell and back to get her,

772
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:40,796
so don't tell me about losing a
friend.

773
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:47,269
She was a good soldier, and her
death will not be in vain.

774
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:50,472
Now, we're running out of time.
It's still out there.

775
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:53,475
And about to run amok into Stage
Five.

776
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:56,678
St... Okay. What-What's Stage
Five?

777
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,986
Doc, what happens in Stage Five?
Come on.

778
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:06,989
This is not the first time you
guys have dealt with this.

779
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,691
What did you make that is
running around killing people?

780
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:13,061
We didn't make anything, at
least not intentionally.

781
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:19,768
This arachnid is an aberration
from several unusual technologies.

782
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,239
Come on. In layman's terms, what
are we dealing with?

783
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:28,043
Alien biology, not terrestrial.

784
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:30,946
So you're saying the spider's an
alien?

785
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,048
Yeah.

786
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:40,556
Not exactly, but yes. DNA cross breeding
from microbial fossil found in Martian soil.

787
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:44,960
So you made a spider do it with
an alien. That's messed up.

788
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,762
No, no, no.

789
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:48,964
That's messed up, guys. This is
your people, Alex.

790
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:52,167
No, no, no, we did cross breed
two species.

791
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:57,940
We isolated separate genes, one
of which, in particular,

792
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:04,813
produces a superior growth hormone.
It's promise is infinite.

793
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,116
Giant tomatoes to feed the whole
world and such.

794
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:11,320
"Tomatoes" is the first word I
understood. You know?

795
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:14,323
But something went wrong.

796
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,324
No kidding.

797
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,025
I got a question for you.

798
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,760
Yes.

799
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:21,063
So why do we got the giant spider?
I don't get it. You get it?

800
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,165
I don't get it. What's with the
spider, doc?

801
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,133
We don't get it. You get it,
Braxton?

802
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:29,872
It was an accident. One of the
fruit plants that were brought

803
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:36,778
in as a test subject had a spider's nest hidden inside.
The arachnid biology...

804
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,082
...was immediately responsive to
our growth hormone.

805
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:43,619
Major and I monitored four
stages of growth.

806
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:49,825
Letting it proceed to Stage
Five was deemed unacceptable.

807
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:53,061
What happens in Stage Five?

808
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:56,999
What happens in Stage Five?

809
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,068
Reproduction.

810
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:08,070
Of course. Reproduction. I should've guessed that.
Yes, of course reproduction.

811
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:12,214
It would have to be
reproduction, right?

812
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,217
Because this fairytale has got
spiders from Mars, right?

813
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,720
It's a nice little bedtime story
to tell us you're telling us.

814
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,055
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,723
You got spiders humping each
other.

816
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:27,496
Alex, even with our high-tech equipment,
you managed to find it the same time we did.

817
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:28,530
Yes, I did.

818
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,398
No, wait. We did. Okay?

819
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,933
Right.

820
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,067
Correct?

821
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,368
You seem to understand its
nature.

822
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,436
Yes, I do.

823
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,204
So what's your best guess?

824
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:39,508
Oh, so now you want our help,
huh? School them, Alex.

825
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:44,479
All right,
my professional opinion is that without question,

826
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:50,686
she's going to lay her eggs as far away
from a populated area as she can get.

827
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:54,089
Humans she doesn't trust. She
never has.

828
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,159
So you're not going to find her
anywhere near a populated area.

829
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:59,795
What, like under a bridge or a
warehouse or s...

830
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,563
No, no, even more isolated. Far
away.

831
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:02,998
Sir, sir.

832
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,099
Far away.

833
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,101
Sir, I think you need to see
this.

834
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,271
We have a live feed of
Newscopter 8 that has spotted...

835
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,406
...the creature headed toward
Little Tokyo.

836
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:14,509
We advise you that if you are in
that area to evacuate immediately.

837
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:15,744
Or she might go downtown.

838
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:17,379
Oh, l-look. It's right there.

839
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:18,113
Found her.

840
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,247
It's big.

841
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,300
It appears to be climbing up the
top of City Hall.

842
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:41,970
The size of it is just unbelievable.
It also appears to be hostile.

843
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,774
If you are in the downtown
area...

844
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,079
All right, son, this is Tanner.
Request status on Operation Ground Swell.

845
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,081
Call in an air strike, Major.

846
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,283
Wait. Air strike? What air
strike?

847
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:29,184
Contingency.

848
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,719
You can't just drop a bomb here.

849
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,220
Oh, that's not good.

850
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,623
No, you can't... you can't bomb
downtown L.A.

851
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:38,326
We're running a little low on options,
so I'm calling in a targeted air strike.

852
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:40,629
You're risking the lives of
thousands of people.

853
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:42,097
Saving millions.

854
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,399
Wait a minute. There's got to be
a better way

855
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:47,602
Enough of this. Remove this
Western terminator.

856
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:49,204
What?

857
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,373
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you
try it, pretty guy.

858
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,574
Oh, Okay. You got it.

859
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:55,711
Okay, we're leaving.

860
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,756
Sir, we have a lock on the
building.

861
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,061
Zooming in.

862
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,971
Is that Lieutenant Brandt?

863
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,777
I need a minute.

864
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,779
Copy that.

865
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,585
I hope you have insurance.

866
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,087
The company has insurance, yes.

867
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,555
Well, don't worry about it-

868
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:43,024
Alex, wait. It's Karly. She's
still alive.

869
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:44,993
Don't mess with me.

870
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:47,929
That spider,
she laid her eggs on top of the Epic Bank Building.

871
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,199
There are a lot of people trapped up there.
Karly's one of them.

872
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,201
Okay, so what do we do?

873
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:55,437
Well, you have about 24 minutes
before the jets arrive there.

874
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,973
And what happens before then is
up to you.

875
01:02:57,975 --> 01:02:59,474
I'll drive.

876
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:03,545
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

877
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,251
Okay, so what's the plan, Alex?

878
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:13,755
Stop the spider, save
the city, kiss the girl.

879
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:17,459
Oh, good. Any idea how to do
that?

880
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,060
No

881
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,564
That's what I thought.

882
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,912
Our guns are doing nothing
against this thing.

883
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:42,918
Disengage. Disengage. Pull back,
but maintain visual contact.

884
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,421
See, it's a perfect target up there.
If we can take it out on the rooftop,

885
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,757
it'll keep civilian casualties
to a minimum

886
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:53,028
As long as we take out that
building before the eggs hatch.

887
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,577
So can I ask you something else,
Alex?

888
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,079
Sure. Go, Mexican Robin.

889
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:46,381
How are we going to kill this
big spider?

890
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,718
I'm trying to figure that one
out. I mean, we can't shoot it.

891
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,820
Why?

892
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:54,422
Why? Because it's huge.
The exoskeleton alone is stronger than anything

893
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:58,760
we've got to penetrate it, and it's resistant to flames.
It's resistant to any kind of heat.

894
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:01,763
We have not even created a fire
suit strong enough to-

895
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:03,164
Fire, eh? How about <i>fuego</i>?

896
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,766
No, no, I just said it's
resistant to fire.

897
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:07,702
Yes, but the web catches on
fire, so can we use that?

898
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:08,436
Wait a minute.

899
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:09,404
What?

900
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,705
Wait a minute. That's it. Jose!

901
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,774
What?

902
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:15,644
If we can ignite the spinneret,
we can blow it up from the inside out.

903
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:16,344
Really?

904
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:17,112
Yes!

905
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:17,946
What's a spinneret?

906
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:18,747
Spinnerets.

907
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:19,748
Spinnerets.

908
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,749
Spin.

909
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:21,483
Spin.

910
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:22,484
Spin.

911
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:23,485
Er...

912
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:24,319
er...

913
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,053
...ets.

914
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,087
...ets.

915
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,122
Spinnerets.

916
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:28,757
Where's the spinnerets?

917
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,225
In its ass.

918
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:31,693
So we have to shoot the spider
in the butt.

919
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:32,661
In the butt.

920
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:33,662
How we going to do that?

921
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:34,763
That's right.

922
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:35,730
Uh, how we going to do that?

923
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:36,765
With this.

924
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,766
Oh, baby.

925
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,067
Right?

926
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:42,137
Wicked.

927
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,575
Where's the air strike?

928
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,843
E.T.A. two minutes.

929
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,212
Have them circle once more.

930
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:57,819
You are insane, Braxton. You can't risk these
eggs hatching. Take down that building now.

931
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:01,523
I'm done with you scientists.
You started this thing.

932
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:04,025
Now, you let us finish it.
Remove this man.

933
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,728
Escort him out of my command
center now.

934
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,731
I will see you in hell, Braxton.

935
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,967
Get me Alex on the phone.

936
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,174
Western. We live to kill.

937
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,710
Alex, you have 10 minutes to get
to the 60th floor.

938
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:25,280
After that I have no choice.
We can't risk any of those eggs hatching.

939
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:28,216
Ten minutes is all we're going
to need.

940
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,621
Look out. Look out!

941
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,083
No, no.

942
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,786
Jose! Hey, Jose!

943
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,227
Okay, I've got to go save Karly.
I've got to go save those people.

944
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,595
I'm coming with you.

945
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,231
No, we may not get out of there
in time.

946
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:55,336
Then we better get moving. Let's
do it, Alex.

947
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,628
Air strike E.T.A. five minutes
away.

948
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,083
E.T.A. three minutes.

949
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:44,385
God help us all.

950
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,840
We're gonna kill some spiders.
Gonna kill some spiders dead.

951
01:09:05,842 --> 01:09:10,879
We're gonna kills some spiders.
Gonna shoot those muthas in the head.

952
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,189
And stop.

953
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,191
That's pretty good.

954
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:24,926
That was all right.

955
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,362
Let's do this. You ready?

956
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:28,196
I'm ready.

957
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,831
You nervous?

958
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:30,965
Yes.

959
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:32,167
It's good that you're nervous.

960
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:35,170
Let's do this.

961
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:56,191
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
This is what I was afraid of. She's laid her eggs.

962
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,692
Holy <i>juevos.</i>

963
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,060
Oh, look at this.

964
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:00,094
Oh, man.

965
01:10:00,096 --> 01:10:01,763
Alex!

966
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:02,764
Karly.

967
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:04,065
Alex!

968
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:05,099
She's alive.

969
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:06,668
You were right.

970
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,770
I'm going to go help her. You
help these people.

971
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:10,972
Okay, I will.

972
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:15,677
There you go. Go towards the exit on the left,
there's a lot of spiders on the right. Okay

973
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:16,811
Alex!

974
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,113
Okay, I'm right here. Right
here.

975
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:22,317
Just promise me this is the last time that
I'm going to have to rescue you today.

976
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,252
I mean, seriously, two saves in
one day

977
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,787
Hurry.

978
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:32,994
Alex! Alex!

979
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,729
I got it.

980
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,204
Nice

981
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,406
Oh, boy

982
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,745
Here they come. Time to go!

983
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,248
Help me! Oh, my God, help me!

984
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,985
I need a hand. I need a hand!

985
01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:59,254
Oh, my God, she's dead.

986
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,724
We gotta go. We gotta go.

987
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:04,425
Alex!

988
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:10,265
Come on, Alex! Clear out! Clear
out!

989
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,969
Come on, Alex!

990
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,806
Thank you for calling Western.

991
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:26,147
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come
on! Come on! Come on!

992
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,253
Nice shot.

993
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:35,957
Yeah, well, now we're even

994
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,959
No, not quite

995
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,260
What?

996
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,098
We're out of time.

997
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,701
Engage target. Engage target.

998
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,988
Yes!

999
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,491
Well, let's not celebrate just
yet.

1000
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:20,501
So how much you gonna charge for
killing the big spider?

1001
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,538
I don't know, but I hope it
covers the cost of a new truck.

1002
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,673
Yes, he is. The major wants to
talk to you.

1003
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,208
Major? Hope I'm not in trouble.

1004
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,876
I hope not either.

1005
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,978
Yeah, Major?

1006
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,483
I gotta hand it to you, kid. You knocked it
out of the park. Thank you for saving Karly.

1007
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:40,188
Well, thank you very much, sir.
I told you I'm a professional.

1008
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:43,491
That you are, son. That you are.

1009
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:47,195
Yeah, well, any time you have any trouble,
you know who to call,

1010
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:50,231
except it's not going to be
cheap. I've got a partner now.

1011
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,304
And there's a little business about my,
uh... my truck. I made some modifications to it.

1012
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:58,239
Alex.

1013
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:01,376
And I'm not sure that the insurance
at the company's going to cover it.

1014
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,077
Alex.

1015
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,787
Major, I'm going to have to call
you back.

1016
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:15,289
Alex, can we get out of here?

1017
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:19,093
I'm sorry, Jose. I live to kill.

1018
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:21,028
Okay.

1019
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,532
I got your back, babe.

1020
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,234
Hey, Jose.

1021
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,002
What?

1022
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,605
You remember that conversation
we had in the... in the truck?

1023
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:31,706
Which one?

1024
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,074
The one about the spinneret.

1025
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,710
We're going to shoot it in the
butt.

1026
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:36,944
Find me that bazooka!

1027
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,514
You got it, Alex.

1028
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:48,456
You want some of the Ex?

1029
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,698
Alex! I'm coming.

1030
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,542
Throw it to me.

1031
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,611
Watch out, Alex! Wake up, Alex!

1032
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,127
Up yours.

1033
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,622
Yeah!

1034
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,171
Nicely done.

1035
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:14,408
I told you I'm a pro. I'm a pro.
Oh, look at you, you're gross.

1036
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,510
Oh.

1037
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:17,411
You've got web all over you.

1038
01:15:17,413 --> 01:15:19,080
You're one to talk.

1039
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,315
Well, it looks like we're stuck
together for a while.

1040
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,717
Is that a problem?

1041
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,352
No, I don't have a problem with
that.

1042
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:27,421
Well, what should you do with
the rest of your day off?

1043
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:30,091
I can think of a few things.

1044
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,467
All right, you guys.

1045
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:44,739
Okay. Hey, come on, guys. Get a
room. Okay?

1046
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:13,794
Alex, I'm afraid we have a little problem.
What's the biggest cockroach you ever saw?
